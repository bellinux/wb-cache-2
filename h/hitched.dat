5|$|Even {{after the}} chariot had become {{obsolete}} {{as a tool}} of war, there still was a need for technological innovations in pulling technologies; horses were needed to pull heavy loads of supplies and weapons. The invention of the horse collar in China during the 5th century AD (Southern and Northern Dynasties) allowed horses to pull greater weight than they could when <b>hitched</b> to a vehicle with the ox yokes or breast collars used in earlier times. The horse collar arrived in Europe during the 9th century, and became widespread by the 12th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{invention}} of the wheel was a major technological innovation {{that gave rise to}} chariot warfare. At first, equines, both horses and onagers, were <b>hitched</b> to wheeled carts by means of a yoke around their necks {{in a manner similar to}} that of oxen. However, such a design is incompatible with equine anatomy, limiting both the strength and mobility of the animal. By the time of the Hyksos invasions of Egypt, c.1600 BC, horses were pulling chariots with an improved harness design that made use of a breastcollar and breeching, which allowed a horse to move faster and pull more weight.|$|E
2500|$|The {{adjustable}} loop {{forms of}} the rolling <b>hitch</b> and Magnus <b>hitch,</b> {{in addition to being}} called either of those two names, have also come to be known variously as the taut-line <b>hitch,</b> tent-line <b>hitch,</b> rigger's <b>hitch,</b> adjustable <b>hitch,</b> or midshipman's <b>hitch.</b> [...] These knots are generally shown as being based on one of three underlying hitches: two variants of the rolling <b>hitch</b> (ABOK #1734 and #1735) and the Magnus <b>hitch</b> (#1736).|$|R
50|$|One {{instance}} where a half <b>hitch</b> {{stands on}} its own without additional embellishment is when added to a timber <b>hitch</b> to help stabilize a load {{in the direction of}} pull. A timber <b>hitch</b> is tied on {{the far end of the}} load to bind it securely and a half <b>hitch</b> made at the forward end to serve as a guide for the rope. In this instance, the half <b>hitch</b> combined with a timber <b>hitch</b> is known as a killick <b>hitch</b> or kelleg <b>hitch.</b>|$|R
50|$|The lobster buoy <b>hitch</b> {{is similar}} to the {{buntline}} <b>hitch,</b> but made with a cow <b>hitch</b> around the standing part rather than a clove <b>hitch.</b>|$|R
5|$|Buzz impresses {{the other}} toys with his various features, and Andy begins to favor him, making Woody feel left out. As Andy prepares {{for a family}} outing at Pizza Planet, his mother allows him to bring one toy. Fearing Andy will choose Buzz, Woody {{attempts}} to trap Buzz behind a desk, but ends up accidentally knocking him out a window, and the other toys rebel against Woody by accusing him of knocking Buzz out of jealousy. Before they can exact revenge, Andy takes Woody instead and leaves for Pizza Planet. When the family stops for gas, Woody finds that Buzz has <b>hitched</b> {{a ride on the}} car as well, and fight, only to find the family has left without them. They manage to {{make their way to the}} restaurant by stowing away on a pizza delivery truck, where Buzz, still thinking he is a real space ranger, despite Woody's attempts to convince him otherwise, gets them stuck in a crane game, where they are salvaged by Andy's mischievous neighbor, Sid Phillips.|$|E
5|$|The average horse {{can carry}} up to {{approximately}} 30% {{of its body}} weight. While all horses can pull more than they can carry, the weight horses can pull varies widely, depending on the build of the horse, the type of vehicle, road conditions, and other factors. Horses harnessed to a wheeled vehicle on a paved road can pull as much as eight times their weight, but far less if pulling wheelless loads over unpaved terrain. Thus, horses that were driven varied in size and {{had to make a}} trade-off between speed and weight, just as did riding animals. Light horses could pull a small war chariot at speed. Heavy supply wagons, artillery, and support vehicles were pulled by heavier horses or a larger number of horses. The method by which a horse was <b>hitched</b> to a vehicle also mattered: horses could pull greater weight with a horse collar than they could with a breast collar, and even less with an ox yoke.|$|E

50|$|Continuous ring <b>hitching,</b> {{also known}} as single ringbolt <b>hitching,</b> {{is a series of}} {{identical}} <b>hitches</b> made around a ring. This is considered the simplest form of ringbolt <b>hitching.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The killick <b>hitch</b> [...] {{is a type}} of <b>hitch</b> knot used {{to attach}} a rope to oddly shaped objects. This knot is also known as the kelleg <b>hitch.</b> It is a {{combination}} of a timber <b>hitch</b> tied in conjunction with a half <b>hitch,</b> which is added to lend support and stability when pulling or hoisting the object; the addition of a half-hitch in front of the timber <b>hitch</b> creates a timber <b>hitch</b> and a half <b>hitch,</b> known as a killick <b>hitch</b> when at sea. A killick is [...] "a small anchor or weight for mooring a boat, sometimes consisting of a stone secured by pieces of wood".|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the geometry of the <b>hitch</b> on the behaviour of the tractor and of the implement is theoretically analysed. Three-point <b>hitches</b> are compared to one-point <b>hitches.</b> In the vertical plane the possibility, when a three-point <b>hitch</b> is used, to position the virtual <b>hitch</b> point very low and very {{far ahead of the}} implement is found to be advantageous, together with its property to allow easy adjustment of the position of the virtual <b>hitch</b> point. In the horizontal plane, the tractional <b>hitch</b> point of a three-point <b>hitch</b> normally does not coincide with its directional <b>hitch</b> point. When a one-point <b>hitch</b> is used the tractional and the directional <b>hitch</b> points coincide. This very fundamental difference gives the three-point <b>hitch</b> some unique properties. Equations describing the angle deflection and the lateral deflection of both directional and non-directional implements are presented. They show that a non-directional implement's lateral deflection as well as its angle deflection when used on a hillside or when asymmetrically loaded, normally are much smaller when a three-point <b>hitch</b> is used than when a one-point <b>hitch</b> is used. An equation is also presented describing the return of an implement after a lateral deflection. The theory of a laterally mobile, but stable, front-mounted three-point <b>hitch</b> is presented...|$|R

25|$|Tandem or spider rappelling — Involves two climbers {{descending}} on {{the same}} belay device. This is done in some rescue situations {{when one of the}} climbers is incapacitated or the descent needs to be done quickly. The set-up is similar to a regular rappelling set-up with the first climber is girth <b>hitched</b> off a sling into the descender on the carabiner, and has an auto-block from belay loop of the harness to the rope as a backup. The second rappeller is also girth <b>hitched</b> into the belay device on the carabiner and also anchored into the main rappeller's harness as a back-up.|$|E

5000|$|In North America {{the vehicle}} {{attachment}} {{is known as}} the trailer <b>hitch.</b> Trailer <b>hitches</b> come in two main configurations: receiver type and fixed-drawbar type. Receiver-type <b>hitches</b> consist of a portion that mounts to the frame of the vehicle that has a rearward-facing opening that accepts removable ball mounts, <b>hitch</b> bike racks, cargo carriers, or other <b>hitch</b> mounted accessories. Fixed-drawbar <b>hitches</b> are typically built as one piece, have an integrated hole for the trailer ball, and are generally not compatible with aftermarket <b>hitch</b> accessories.|$|R
50|$|Two {{successive}} half <b>hitches</b> {{tied around}} an object {{makes up the}} common clove <b>hitch.</b> Two successive half <b>hitches</b> tied around the standing part of a rope is known as two half-hitches or double half <b>hitch.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Fast <b>Hitch</b> was IH's {{answer to}} the three-point <b>hitch</b> {{developed}} years earlier by Harry Ferguson, and featured on Ford-Ferguson tractors. The Fast <b>Hitch</b> was first offered as an option on the Super C. Fast <b>Hitch</b> was then an option on the 100, 200, 300, and 400 and some later models. However, even the Fast <b>Hitch</b> had three incompatible variants (100—single prong, 200—two small prongs, 300/400—two large prongs). IH discontinued the Fast <b>Hitch</b> in the 1960s after the three-point <b>hitch</b> was standardized and adopted by all manufacturers. There are kits available {{from a variety of}} sources that will either convert a Fast <b>Hitch</b> to a three-point, or add a three-point <b>hitch</b> to tractors that originally only had a fixed drawbar.|$|R
25|$|Driving {{with all}} four wheels on unploughed land is another {{solution}} to the problem of wide tyres. Semi-mounted ploughs can be <b>hitched</b> in are heavier and more expensive than right-handed models, but they have the great advantage of leaving a level surface which makes seedbed preparation and harvesting easier. Very little marking out is necessary before ploughing can start and idle running on the headland is minimal compared with conventional ploughs.|$|E
25|$|On 1 June 2002, Cronje's {{scheduled}} flight home from Johannesburg to George was grounded. So he <b>hitched</b> a ride {{as the only}} passenger aboard a Hawker Siddeley HS 748 turboprop aircraft. Near George airport, the pilots lost visibility in clouds and were unable to land, partly due to unusable navigational equipment. While circling, the plane crashed into the Outeniqua Mountains northeast of the airport. Cronje, aged 32, and the two pilots were killed instantly.|$|E
25|$|The horse chariot was a fast, light, open, two-wheeled {{conveyance}} {{drawn by}} two or more horses that were <b>hitched</b> side by side, and {{was little more than}} a floor with a waist-high guard at the front and sides. It was initially used for ancient warfare during the Bronze and Iron Ages; but, after its military capabilities had been superseded by cavalry, as horses were gradually bred to be bigger, the chariot was used for travel, in processions, for games, and in races.|$|E
50|$|The running highwayman's <b>hitch,</b> mooring <b>hitch,</b> or {{sliding sheet}} bend is a <b>hitch</b> knot tied by looping {{the end of}} the rope around an object, and then fixing it to the {{standing}} part with a highwayman's <b>hitch.</b>|$|R
50|$|The magnus <b>hitch</b> is a knot {{similar to}} a rolling <b>hitch</b> or clove <b>hitch,</b> used to tie a rope or line to a pole, spar, or another line. It is tied {{similarly}} to a rolling <b>hitch</b> but with the final <b>hitch</b> in the opposite direction. It can be more tricky to snug up, since both lines emerge from {{the same side of}} the <b>hitch,</b> but it has less tendency to twist under load.|$|R

25|$|During {{the ride}} the car passed several service {{stations}} {{but the man}} did not stop. For about 90 minutes he drove back and forth around the backroads near Tracy. When Johns asked why he was not stopping, he would change the subject. When the driver finally stopped at an intersection, Johns jumped out with her daughter and hid in a field. The driver searched for her using his flashlight telling her {{that he would not}} hurt her, before eventually giving up. Unable to find her, he got back into the car and drove off. Johns <b>hitched</b> a ride to the police station in Patterson.|$|E
25|$|Alan Livingston {{began his}} career in the {{entertainment}} business leading his own college orchestra as a student at the University of Pennsylvania. After graduating from the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce with a B.S. in Economics, he moved to New York where he worked in advertising for three years. At the start of World War II, he enlisted in the army as a private and served as a second lieutenant in the infantry. After his discharge, he borrowed some money, <b>hitched</b> a ride on an Army plane and headed for Los Angeles, California where he obtained his first position with Capitol Records, Inc. in Hollywood as a writer/producer.|$|E
25|$|After graduating {{he worked}} for a year in his father's {{business}} (Faiz and Co.) of exporting scrap iron to Japan. He bought a secondhand 10/12 HP (horsepower) Harley Davidson motorcycle to travel extensively in and around Bombay. He also bought an old Lancia Tourer, which he used for several months. In 1938, he and his friend Boman Patuck met with a motorcycle accident that left them seriously injured. A policeman who had <b>hitched</b> a ride with them died in the accident. Humayun was charged with rash and negligent driving and was subsequently acquitted by a court in Bombay. He replaced the motorbike with a Morris Minor in 1939, which he used until his death.|$|E

25|$|On {{the final}} Friday of Gimblett's trial, Somerset found {{themselves}} a player short for the match {{that started the}} following day against Essex at Frome when the amateur Laurie Hawkins reported in sick. Gimblett was told to get himself to Frome: Daniell arranged for the wicketkeeper Wally Luckes, who had a car, {{to pick him up}} from Bridgwater. Gimblett missed the bus from Taunton, and <b>hitched</b> a lift in a lorry. Somerset won the toss and chose to bat: three batsmen were out for 35, and at lunch the score was 105 for five. Soon after lunch, Dickie Burrough was out and Gimblett came to the wicket with Somerset six wickets down for 107 runs, joining Arthur Wellard.|$|E
25|$|At one point, local commanders {{decided to}} remove the coastal {{artillery}} from the badly damaged fortress, and the 33rd was asked to help. The guns were removed from their five- to eight-inch bases during daylight hours; later, at night, they were slung beneath a specially built wagon equipped with fourteen-inch-wide tires, to which thirty-six mules were <b>hitched.</b> A lengthy rope was tied to the tongue, and 100 soldiers were tasked with pulling on it to help these mules haul the cannon across the sandy beach to barges on the bay, which in turn carried them on to Pensacola. The guns were replaced with wood planks shaped and painted to resemble artillery, to deceive the Federals into thinking the fortor {{what was left of}} it at this pointwas still a threat.|$|E
25|$|After 1891, {{the canal}} principally transported coal, and {{sometimes}} West Virginia limestone, wood, lumber, sand, and flour. (Statistics were only kept for coal.) Coal was loaded in the Cumberland basin, {{which consisted of}} dumping four carloads of coal into the boat. Some of the coal had to be shoveled by hand into the spaces beneath the cabins. During the loading process, nobody {{would be on the}} boat due to the dust, and mules were kept off, in case the boat sank from being loaded. Despite closing windows, dust usually entered the cabins. After loading, the ridge poles would be put, then the hatches over the ridge poles and openings. The crew would scrub down the boat (using water from the canal) to remove the dust, and the boat would be poled {{to the other side of}} the basin, where it would be <b>hitched</b> to the mules.|$|E
