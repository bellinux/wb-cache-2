40|$|The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Microwave Imager (GMI) program {{delivered}} the GMI Instrument to Goddard Space Flight Center early 2012. Currently, the GMI instrument is undergoing observatory-level integration and test. Goddard Space Flight Center {{plans to launch}} the GMI in 2014 aboard the GPM spacecraft with the Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar, affording better correlation of active and passive measurement techniques. The GMI will fly in a 65 degree inclination orbit and is intended to become the calibration standard for radiometer precipitation measurements. The GMI employs a unique dual calibration system. As other scanning microwave imagers, the GMI provides primary calibration using a hot load blackbody and cold sky view. Unlike other microwave imagers, the GMI uses a secondary calibration system with <b>noise</b> <b>diodes</b> on the lower frequency channels. The <b>noise</b> <b>diodes</b> provide four calibration points, rather than just two. The dual calibration system enables on-board trending of non-linearity, as well independent cross-checking of each calibration element for stability and anomalous behavior. One important benefit of the dual calibration system is the direct evaluation of <b>noise</b> <b>diode</b> behavior on-orbit. For systems that depend solely on <b>noise</b> <b>diodes</b> for calibration, validation of the <b>noise</b> <b>diode</b> performance {{has to be done}} vicariously, using the earth as the reference. Using GMI, <b>noise</b> <b>diode</b> performance analysis can be done directly using the hot load and cold sky views. This paper presents the pre-flight calibration performance of the <b>noise</b> <b>diodes</b> based on thermal vacuum measurements taken during GMI testing. We address stability of the <b>noise</b> <b>diodes,</b> and draw conclusions of on-orbit <b>noise</b> <b>diode</b> performance based on the ground measurements...|$|R

The advantage of the noise figure meter is that it will automatically switch the <b>noise</b> <b>diode</b> on and off, giving a continuous reading of Y; it will also have the correct bandwidths in its receiver to average the received noise in an optimum fashion.

[...] By using a <b>noise</b> <b>diode,</b> the output <b>noise</b> of the amplifier is measured using two input noise levels (the Excess Noise Ratio) and by measuring the output noise factor (referred to as Y) the noise figure of the amplifier can be determined without having to measure the amplfier gain.|$|R
5000|$|The KG-13 {{employed}} [...] "FLYBALL" [...] modules. These were modules made {{of discrete}} components {{set up as}} logic element circuit groups such as NAND gates, NOR gates, XOR gates, flip flops, monostables, multivibrators, etc. Once tested, the modules were potted in a compound whose colour indicated their function. The coloured potting compound was extremely hard and any attempt to penetrate it resulted in damage to the internal circuitry. In a KG-13, the following colours are confirmed: Pink, Yellow, Green, Blue, Red, Orange and Black. Purple and Brown modules were probably used but those colours are unconfirmed as of this time. Yellow modules were single transistor emitter follower clock drivers. Pink modules were two transistor shift register flip flops. Each yellow module drove nine pink ones. A two transistor multivibrator module drove the audio alarm thru an amplifier. Two transistor monostables were also used. NAND and NOR modules were built from a single transistor and XOR modules were built from two transistors. Failures usually occurred in the power supplies, buffers, and synchronizers though most problems were quickly resolved. When new, there was a high frequency of failures due to cold solder joints. One board in the KG-13 had a black module which was a noise generator containing a Zener <b>diode</b> <b>noise</b> source. This was the only classified module because the noise was used to randomize the key stream on startup. The circuitry inside the module then used the koken chain shift registers to create an pseudo random key stream. That was why {{there was no problem}} in restarting the KG-13 with the same card. The noise source ensured that the chances of duplicating the start point was negligible.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Recent studies {{demonstrated}} that chaotic spike sequences {{appearing in the}} context of incomplete homoclinic scenarios can be understood in terms of excitability of chaotic attractors. So far, this particular dynamic has been found in a semiconductor laser with optoelectronic feedback. Here, we show that the same phenomenology occurs also in light-emitting diodes, which are ideal candidates for the implementation of a complex network on a chip. In particular, we study the appearance of both stochastic incoherence (SI) and stochastic coherence (SC) in a single unit, as well as in two coupled units. We demonstrate experimentally and explore numerically the enhancement of SC and worsening of SI induced by coupling systems in array.

40|$|A {{sophisticated}} {{noise measurement}} setup employing a switching unit to measure statistically relevant numbers of InAs/GaSb superlattice photodiodes has been developed. The noise current resolution limit of 20 fA Hz(- 1 / 2) enables {{the characterization of}} focal plane array-sized InAs/GaSb superlattice homojunction photodiodes for the long-wavelength infrared at 77 K. To resolve midwavelength infrared photodiodes a junction area of about (400 µm) 2 is required. Without switching unit and by using a dedicated low noise amplifier, noise currents down to 2 fA Hz(- 1 / 2) can be achieved, allowing the noise characterization of mid-wavelength photodiodes with smaller junction areas. With this setup longwavelength and mid-wavelength InAs/GaSb superlattice photodiodes, with generation-recombination limited dark current behavior, are investigated at 77 K. The measured <b>diode</b> <b>noise</b> follows the theoretically predicted shot noise level within the white noise part of the spectra...|$|E
40|$|The low {{frequency}} Schottky <b>diode</b> <b>noise</b> {{has been investigated}} in GaAs power MESFETs. For those devices, gate noise spectra are generally composed of 1 /f and shot noise contributions. We have observed an increase by two orders of magnitude of the noise level when MESFETs are submitted to rf life-test. The increase of the 1 /f noise {{can be explained by}} a modification of the gate space charge region extension. This interpretation is sustained by a reduction of the drain current transient magnitude and the inherent active trap density. A correlation is assumed between the increase of the shot noise level after rf life-test and a micro-plasma formation. Both 1 /f noise and shot noise evolution might originate in a local increase of the electric field {{in the vicinity of the}} gate in drain access region. We have demonstrated that LF gate current noise is an early indicator of damage mechanisms occurring at the gate-semiconductor and passivation-semiconductor interfaces of the devices...|$|E
40|$|To examine {{defects in}} InAs/GaSb type-II superlattices we {{investigated}} GaSb substrates and epitaxial InAs/GaSb layers by synchrotron white beam X-ray topography {{to characterize the}} distribution of threading dislocations. Those measurements are compared with wet chemical etch pit density measurements on GaSb substrates and InAs/GaSb type-II superlattices epitaxial layer structures. The technique uses a wet chemical etch process to decorate threading dislocations and an automated optical analyzing system for mapping the defect distribution. Dark current and noise measurements on processed InAs/GaSb type-II superlattice single element photo diodes reveal a generation-recombination limited dark current behavior without contributions by surface leakage currents for midwavelength infrared detectors. In the white noise part of the noise spectrum, the extracted <b>diode</b> <b>noise</b> closely matches the theoretically expected shot noise behavior. For diodes with an increased dark current {{in comparison to the}} dark current of generation-recombination limited material, the standard shot-noise model fails to describe the noise experimentally observed in the white part of the spectrum. Instead, we find that McIntyre's noise model for avalanche multiplication processes fits the data quite well. We suggest that within high electric field domains localized around crystallographic defects, electrons initiate avalanche multiplication processes leading to increased dark current and excess noise...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1999 In {{order to}} observe laser phase noise, this noise must be {{converted}} to amplitude noise, which can be achieved using either an interferometer or an absorption resonance in an atomic/molecular vapor or gas. When phase noise is converted to amplitude noise, it is manifested as a heterodyne signal in the output of an optical square-law detector. Thus, phase noise is measured by optical heterodyne spectroscopy, or, equivalently, laser phase noise spectroscopy. In recent work on <b>diode</b> laser <b>noise</b> spectroscopy of rubidium and oxygen, the observed spectroscopic lineshapes were not in total agreement with theoretical predictions. We have repeated the previous work on the oxygen A-band transitions, and we now find qualitative agreement with theory. In addition, we have measured the <b>diode</b> laser <b>noise</b> spectrum of a Lummer- Gehrcke interferometer (LGI), comparing the heterodyne lineshape of a LGI transmission spectrum with a qualitative theory that we develop in this thesis. A theory, from other workers, predicts the intensity fluctuations from a Doppler-broadened, two-level atomic/molecular system driven with a phase-diffusing laser field. We show that a simplified version of this theory, which ignores Doppler effects of the system, is a useful approximation to the complete theory, by comparing computer-generated heterodyne lineshapes of each, for a rubidium transition. We apply this approximate theory to an oxygen A-band transition, and compare these results with our experimental measurements. For the experimental arrangement {{used in the present}} work, <b>diode</b> laser <b>noise</b> spectroscopy may also include effects of selective reflection, which is dealt with experimentally and theoretically. <b>Diode</b> laser phase <b>noise</b> has practical importance in optical communications and atomic clocks...|$|R
40|$|The Jason Microwave Radiometer (JMR) is {{included}} on the Jason- 1 ocean altimeter satellite to measure the wet tropospheric path delay (PD) experienced by the radar altimeter signal. JMR is nadir pointing and measures the radiometric brightness temperature (T(sub B)) at 18. 7, 23. 8 and 34. 0 GHz. JMR is a Dicke radiometer {{and it is the}} first radiometer to be flown in space that uses <b>noise</b> <b>diodes</b> for calibration. Therefore, monitoring the long term stability of the <b>noise</b> <b>diodes</b> is essential. Each channel has three redundant <b>noise</b> <b>diodes</b> which are individually coupled into the antenna signal to provide an estimate of the gain. Two significant jumps in the JMR path delays, relative to ground truth, were observed around 300 and 700 days into the mission. Slow drifts in the retrieved products were also evident over the entire mission. During a recalibration effort, it was determined that a single set of calibration coefficients was not able to remove the calibration jumps and drifts, suggesting that there was a change in the hardware and time dependent coefficients would be required. To facilitate the derivation of time dependent coefficients, an optimal estimation based calibration system was developed which iteratively determines that set of calibration coefficients which minimize the RMS difference between the JMR TBs and on-Earth hot and cold absolute references. This optimal calibration algorithm was used to fine tune the front end path loss coefficients and derive a time series of the JMR <b>noise</b> <b>diode</b> brightness temperatures for each of the nine diodes.
