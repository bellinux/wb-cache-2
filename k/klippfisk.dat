2500|$|The fish is {{prepared}} immediately after capture. After gutting the fish, {{it is either}} dried whole, or split along the spine leaving the tail connected. [...] The fish is hung on the hjell from February to May. Stable cool weather protects the fish from insects and prevents an uncontrolled bacterial growth. A temperature just above zero degrees Celsius, with little rain, is ideal. Too much frost will spoil the fish, as ice destroys the fibers in the fish. The climate in northern Norway is excellent for stockfish production. Due to the stable conditions, the stockfish produced in Lofoten and Vesterålen {{is regarded as the}} best. The traditional cod harvest in Lofoten also takes place during the best drying time. Due to a milder and more humid climate, salted/dried whitefish (<b>klippfisk)</b> was more common in the fisheries districts of Western Norway.|$|E

5000|$|Dried and salted cod {{has been}} {{produced}} for over 500 years in Newfoundland, Iceland, and the Faroe Islands, and most particularly in Norway {{where it is}} called <b>klippfisk,</b> literally [...] "cliff-fish". Traditionally it was dried outdoors by the wind and sun, often on cliffs and other bare rock-faces. Today <b>klippfisk</b> is usually dried indoors {{with the aid of}} electric heaters.|$|E
50|$|In Norway, {{there used}} to be five {{different}} grades of salt cod. The best grade was called superior extra. Then came (in descending order) superior, imperial, universal and popular. These appellations are no longer extensively used, although some producers still make the superior products. The best <b>klippfisk,</b> the superior extra, is made only from line-caught cod. The fish is always of the skrei, the cod that once a year is caught during spawning. The fish is bled while alive, before the head is cut off. It is then cleaned, filleted and salted. Fishers and connoisseurs alike place a high importance {{in the fact that the}} fish is line-caught, because if caught in a net, the fish may be dead before caught, which may result in bruising of the fillets. For the same reason it is believed to be important that the <b>klippfisk</b> be bled while still alive. Superior <b>klippfisk</b> is salted fresh, whereas the cheaper grades of <b>klippfisk</b> might be frozen first.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{made from}} aged {{stockfish}} (air-dried whitefish) or dried/salted whitefish (<b>klippfisk)</b> and lye (lut). It is gelatinous in texture. Its name literally means [...] "lye fish".|$|E

50|$|The {{coat-of-arms}} {{were granted}} in 2006 when {{the municipalities of}} Tustna and Aure were merged. They {{are based on the}} arms of the old municipality of Tustna, only the colors were changed. The arms show a white <b>klippfisk</b> (cod) on a blue background. The commercial production of cod in Norway started in Tustna around 1690.|$|E
50|$|Lutefisk - lyed fish: {{a modern}} {{preparation}} made of stockfish (dried cod or ling) or <b>klippfisk</b> (dried and salted cod) {{that has been}} steeped in lye. It was prepared this way because refrigeration was nonexistent and they needed a way to preserve the fish for longer periods. It is somewhat popular in the United States as a heritage food. It retains a place in Norwegian cuisine (especially on the coast) as a traditional food around Christmas time.|$|E
5000|$|The Portuguese {{tried to}} use this method of drying and salting on several {{varieties}} of fish from their waters, but the ideal fish came from much further north. With the [...] "discovery" [...] of Newfoundland in 1497, long after the Basque whalers arrived in Channel-Port aux Basques, they started fishing its cod-rich Grand Banks. Thus, [...] became {{a staple of the}} Portuguese cuisine, nicknamed [...] (faithful friend). From the 18th century, the town of Kristiansund in Norway became an important place of purchasing bacalhau or <b>klippfisk</b> (literally [...] "cliff fish", since the fish was dried on stone cliffs by the sea to begin with.) Since the method was introduced by the Dutchman Jappe Ippes around 1690, the town had produced <b>klippfisk</b> and when the Spanish merchants arrived, it became a big industry. The bacalhau or bacalao dish is sometimes said to originate from Kristiansund, where it was introduced by the Spanish and Portuguese fish buyers and became very popular. Bacalao was common food in northwest Norway to this day, as it was cheap to make. In more recent years, it has become less of an everyday staple and mostly eaten on special occasions.|$|E

50|$|The Norwegian {{aircraft}} {{were acquired}} {{as part of}} a dried and salted cod (<b>Klippfisk)</b> barter deal between Norway and Italy. The original order, including options, was for 24 aircraft, but after seeing that the aircraft did not perform well, the Norwegian authorities refused to accept any further Ca.310s. Instead, a delivery of 12 Caproni Ca.312s with upgraded engines and improved performance was substituted, but not delivered before the German invasion of Norway on 9 April 1940. A similar scenario occurred with other export contracts, especially with a hoped-for Royal Air Force order for bomber trainers being curtailed during negotiations with Caproni when Italy entered the war as an Axis power.|$|E
50|$|The name of {{the period}} comes from the fact, {{that a lot of}} Faroese persons bought used sloops, mainly smacks, from the UK, and this gave an uprise in fishery on the islands. A smack is called slupp in Faroese, from the English word sloop. The Faroe Islands got their first fishing fleet. These fishing vessels were fishing from spring to autumn mainly in the waters around Iceland. Faroese women got an {{opportunity}} to earn money for the first time, when they went to work in the fish industry on land, the fish which the sloops brought to land. The sloops were fishing cod, which was dried and salted, also known as <b>klippfisk</b> because they were often dried by lying on bare rocks.|$|E
5000|$|Hans Holtermann {{was from}} a family of traders and whole merchants on the west coast of Norway. Holtermann's great-grandfather, Coert Holtermann, is {{believed}} to have first immigrated from Rothenburg in Germany to Bergen with his son Henrich Holtermann (1650-1730). They acquired citizenship in 1676 and became involved in trading. Hans Holtermann's father, Henrik Holtermann (1683-1728), acquired trading rights in Bergen. At that time there was no market town (kjobstad) in Sunnmøre and the Holtermans extended their privileges to Borgund and set up a trading post at Brunholmen that eventually became the nucleus of the town of Ålesund. Hans Holtermann operated as a trader in Molde and later at Vegsund in Borgund (now Ålesund). He may also have introduced dried and salted cod (<b>klippfisk)</b> production and trade to the area.|$|E

40|$|This study {{documents}} and discusses the detailed sedimentology of the Berriasian to Early Barremian <b>Klippfisk</b> Formation {{on the western}} Barents Sea, at Bjarmeland Platform, {{northern part of the}} Bjørnøya Basin, northeastern part of the Nordkapp Basin, Nordland VII and Troms III areas of the Northern Norway. The <b>Klippfisk</b> Formation is a condensed carbonate succession deposited on Barents Sea shelf. The formation mainly consists of limestone and marls, often glauconitic. Complete and fragmented shells of Buchia and Inoceramus are abundant in the <b>Klippfisk</b> formation. Rare echinoderms, brachiopods and belemnite are also present. The depositional environment of the <b>Klippfisk</b> Formation has been studied through facies analysis of the core data. Twelve facies has been identified in the formation. At the Nordland VII area, the calcareous siltstone interbedded with beds and nodules of limestone represent a deep shelf depositional environment that was deposited over a long time with low clastic sediments influx. A shelf slope setting is interpreted at the Bjørnøya Basin, where platform is drowned and graded into slope of the shelf. The glauconitic sandstone is intermixed within the dolomitized limestone. The dolomite is followed by highly fossiliferous wackstone and packstone. The fossils identified are complete and fragmented bivalves of Buchia and Inoceramus, foraminifera and subordinate echinoderms. The lowermost limestone of the <b>Klippfisk</b> Formation on the Bjarmeland Platform is mud supported that graded into micritic limestone and fossiliferous packstone. The micrite has algal origin and represent an oxic shallow marine shelf. The regional trend of the <b>Klippfisk</b> Formation has a progradation from deep shelf to shallow marine environment across the Barents Sea shelf from the southeast to the northwest...|$|E
