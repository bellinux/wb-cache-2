5000|$|Blaqkout {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} contemporary music critics. Allmusic rated the album with 3 {{and a half}} stars and wrote Just like the similarly titled 2009 album from Method Man and Redman, DJ Quik and Kurupt's Blaqkout is a throwback triumph that succeeds thanks to the hip-hop veterans' superior chemistry and informal attitude. Anyone expecting a courageous game changer will be disappointed by all the swaggering, sexual bragging, and irresponsible pimping the duo frontload onto the effort, but {{coming to terms with the}} overall weekend attitude is quick and easy, thanks to rock-solid hooks and Quik's production. On [...] "Ohh!" [...] he creates a head-bobbing backing track out of chopped-up vocals and Smooth jazz keyboards, offering a G-funk alternative to Timbaland's [...] "Indian Flute." [...] Key track [...] "Do You Know" [...] finds him blending blissed-out ambience and a Soul II Soul hook, but [...] "F**k Y'All" [...] employs Quik's classic formula with that West Coast funk over thumping bass. The A.V. Club rated the album with a (B+) and wrote DJ Quik has long been one of the most consistent producers in Hip hop, as well as a skilled (though sometimes ridiculously sexist) MC. But he’s seldom been in the lean, adventurous form he explores on BlaQKout, a collaboration with Dogg Pound member Kurupt. Quik’s tracks are head-turning throughout: The blistering single “9X Outta 10” features Kurupt at his steeliest and takes the minimal slam-beats aesthetic of Clipse’s 2002 hit “Grindin'” to a lush new place, especially when a couple of cut-up female vocals enter the mix. “Do You Know” is cinematic soul with his usual easy-gliding groove slipping around under it; “Ohh!” calls up early-’80s Zapp and early-’00s 2-step garage (more cut-up vocals); North African overtones spice the <b>heavy</b> <b>stomp</b> of “Hey Playa (Moroccan Blues).” The lyrics aren’t going to win awards for thematic originality, and there’s an especially egregious spoken-word bit poorly justifying the excessive use of the word “bitch,” but most of the time, Quik and Kurupt sound invigorated by each other. Or as Quik ends a verse in “Hey Playa,” in slow motion, “I’m that much quicker.” The Phoenix gave the album 4/4 stars and wrote LA hip-hop has two threads, and DJ Quik pulls both of them. The first is g-funk, a production style that relies on deep, open grooves and an endless parade of funk samples. The second is West Coast backpacker rap, which is what happens when guys with enormous vocabularies smoke a lot of weed. The fact that Quik has inhabited both worlds for two decades is a pretty nifty trick: he can go [...] "out there" [...] without disappearing completely, and he can talk about problems in the ghetto without sounding as if he lived at the Gap. On BlaQKout, his collaboration with the Philadelphia/LA MC Kurupt, his sonics range far and wide. [...] "Do You Know" [...] has a glamorous sweep that suggests something like wise retrospection, and it leads right into [...] "Watcha Wan Do," [...] which could be the funky soundtrack to a Zelda game. Eventually, there's [...] "9X Outta 10," [...] which sounds as if somebody had handed turntables to the Terminator. This one has Kurupt rapping as if he were hypnotized — [...] "It's gonna start again where it started at/Ended up, and restart again." [...] It all might seem like preamble when you finally get to [...] "Jupiter's Critic and the Mind of Mars," [...] which may be the weirdest slice of rap genius since [...] "A Milli." [...] Quik has some of Prince's little-guy arrogance, and here it's nearly schizoid: [...] "It's character, you miss it?/It's America, you visit?/Did you get on a boat without a ticket?" [...] Uh, yes? What? This makes him sound crazier than he actually is, though. Quik knows what he's doing. You can hear it on every track of this symphonic mini-masterpiece.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{positive}} review {{on the website}} Invisible Oranges, Alee Karim described the album's [...] "machine-gun-picking strafes, <b>heavy</b> mid-tempo <b>stomps,</b> and virtuosic yet hooky Thin Lizzy-esque twin-guitar harmonies" [...] and said, [...] "This may not end up being your favorite Carcass album ... {{but it may be}} objectively the best realization of their sound." [...] Hank Shteamer of Pitchfork called Surgical Steel [...] "a nostalgic statement" [...] that was [...] "enjoyable". He also praised the musicians on the album, such as the [...] "outstanding playing from Steer", [...] "some of the tightest drumming in the band's discography", and called Walker [...] "the star of the record".|$|R
5000|$|Swirling, fleet flamenco guitar work meets {{modern dance}} rhythms on La Esperanza (Higher Octave HOMCD 46227; 63:06), a {{sometimes}} dizzying romantic showcase for multi-instrumentalist Carlos Villalobos. Unlike {{many of his}} Latin-strumming contemporaries, Villalobos doesn't overdress melodies like the lightly walking, cornered [...] "Gabriella's Lullaby," [...] allowing his dynamic strum and fleet fretwork to shine through. He also avoids the everything-sounds-the-same pitfall by reaching {{for a variety of}} textures and styles, from [...] "Spanish Eyes," [...] which amps up a <b>heavy</b> flamenco <b>stomp</b> with rattling, dancing contemporary percussion, to [...] "Para Mi Nicole," [...] a cinematic, dreamy piece which echoes Sting's touching [...] "Fragile." [...] Industrial-to-"house" [...] type rhythms resonate with the chant-and-clap traditionalism of [...] "Guapa." [...] There are many rewarding layers to uncover.|$|R
