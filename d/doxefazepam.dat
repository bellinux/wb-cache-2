It possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. It is used therapeutically as a hypnotic. According to Babbini and colleagues in 1975, this derivative of flurazepam was between 2 and 4 times more potent than the latter {{while at the}} same time being half as toxic in laboratory animals. Section 5.5 of the article <b>Doxefazepam</b> in volume 66 of the World Health Organization's (WHO) and International Agency for Research on Cancer's (IARC) IARC Monographs On The Evaluation Of Carcinogenic Risks To Humans, an article describing the carcinogenic/toxic effects of <b>doxefazepam</b> on humans and experimental animals, states that there is [...] "inadequate evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of doxefazepam" [...] and limited evidence in experimental for the carcinogenicity of doxefazepam," [...] and concluded that the overall evaluation of the substance's carcinogenicity to humans is [...] "not classifiable." ...|$|E
40|$|This sixty-sixth {{volume of}} lARC MOl 1 ographs {{comprises}} evaluations {{on a number}} of pharmaceutical drugs. Pharmaceutical drugs were considered previously in Volumes 13, 24 and 50 and Supplement 7 of the MOl 1 ographs series (IARC, 1977, 1980, 1987, 1990). Several of the compounds- diazepam, oxazepam, clofibrate and phenytoin- have been evaluated by previous working groups. Ail available relevant data including mechanistic data on these compounds are included in the new evaluations. The primary objective of the evaluation process in IARC MOl 1 ographs is hazard or risk identification, although protective effects on cancer occurrence, where pertinent, have been mentioned in the monographs. Several of the pharmaceuticals considered in this volume are benzodiazepines or benzodiazepine analogues. This class of drugs has been extensively prescribed since the late 1950 s for the treatment of anxiety and as sedatives or anticonvulsants, and for other conditions. The specific drugs of this type considered in this volume are diazepam, <b>doxefazepam,</b> estazolam, oxazepam, prazepam, ripazepam and temazepam. ln addition, a diphenylhydantoin, phel 1 ytoil 1, which is another anticonvulsant, was evaluated in thi...|$|E
