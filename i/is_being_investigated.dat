5|$|Currently, {{ytterbium}} <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>investigated</b> as {{a possible}} replacement for magnesium in high density pyrotechnic payloads for kinematic infrared decoy flares. As ytterbium(III) oxide has a significantly higher emissivity in the infrared range than magnesium oxide, a higher radiant intensity is obtained with ytterbium-based payloads in comparison to those commonly based on magnesium/Teflon/Viton (MTV).|$|E

5|$|An X-ray of {{swallowed}} barium {{may be used}} {{to reveal}} {{the size and shape of}} the esophagus, and the presence of any masses. The esophagus may also be imaged using a flexible camera inserted into the esophagus, in a procedure called an endoscopy. If an endoscopy is used on the stomach, the camera will also have to pass through the esophagus. During an endoscopy, a biopsy may be taken. If cancer of the esophagus <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>investigated,</b> other methods, including a CT scan, may also be used.|$|E

5|$|The fungal {{pathogen}} Metarhizium acridum {{is found}} in Africa, Australia and Brazil where it has caused epizootics in grasshoppers. It <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>investigated</b> for possible use as a microbial insecticide for locust control. The microsporidian fungus Nosema locustae, once {{considered to be a}} protozoan, can be lethal to grasshoppers. It has to be consumed by mouth and is the basis for a bait-based commercial microbial pesticide. Various other microsporidians and protozoans are found in the gut.|$|E
5|$|The puffball bioaccumulates {{heavy metals}} {{present in the}} soil, {{and can be used}} as a {{bioindicator}} of soil pollution by heavy metals and selenium. In one 1977 study, samples collected from grassy areas near the side of an interstate highway in Connecticut were shown to have high concentrations of cadmium and lead. L.perlatum biomass has been shown experimentally to remove mercury ions from aqueous solutions, and <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>investigated</b> for potential use as a low-cost, renewable, biosorptive material in the treatment of water and wastewater containing mercury.|$|E
5|$|A {{criticism}} {{of this method}} {{is that it can}} be statistically weak. Schaefer in particular has questioned how robust the claimed alignments in the Caracol are. Because of the wide variety of evidence, which can include artefacts as well as sites, there is no one way to practice archaeoastronomy. Despite this it is accepted that archaeoastronomy is not a discipline that sits in isolation. Because archaeoastronomy is an interdisciplinary field, whatever <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>investigated</b> should make sense both archaeologically and astronomically. Studies {{are more likely to be}} considered sound if they use theoretical tools found in archaeology like analogy and homology and if they can demonstrate an understanding of accuracy and precision found in astronomy. Both quantitative analyses and interpretations based on ethnographic analogies and other contextual evidence have recently been applied in systematic studies of architectural orientations in the Maya area and in other parts of Mesoamerica.|$|E

5|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF), {{a progressive}} multi-system lung disease, {{has been considered}} {{in the search for}} a genetic cause of DPB. This is for a number of reasons. CF, like DPB, causes severe lung inflammation, abundant mucus production, infection, and shows a genetic predominance among Caucasians of one geographic group to the rarity of others; whereas DPB dominates among East Asians, CF mainly affects individuals of European descent. While no gene has been implicated as the cause of DPB, mutation in a specific genemuch more likely to occur in Europeanscauses CF. This mutation in the CF-causing gene is not a factor in DPB, but a unique polymorphism (variation) in this gene is known to occur in many Asians not necessarily affected by either disease. It <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>investigated</b> whether this gene in any state of mutation could contribute to DPB.|$|E
5|$|Yegor Gaidar : The sudden {{illness of}} Yegor Gaidar in Ireland on 24 November 2006, {{the day of}} Litvinenko's death, {{has been linked to}} his visit to the {{restaurant}} where polonium was present and <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>investigated</b> as part of the overall investigation in the UK and Ireland., Other observers noted he was probably poisoned after drinking a strange-tasting cup of tea. Gaidar was taken to hospital; doctors said his condition was not life-threatening and that he would recover. This incident was similar to the poisoning of Anna Politkovskaya on a flight to Beslan. Afterwards, Gaidar claimed that it was enemies of the Kremlin who had tried to poison him.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{his junior}} season, he {{verbally}} {{committed to the}} University of Michigan where he would play for Michigan Wolverines football as a freshman for the 2015 team via Twitter. At the time, he still attended East Lake High School, where {{he was about to}} play his junior year for the 2013 football team. At the time of his July 27, 2013 verbal commitment, he was ranked as the number one athlete and number three player in the class of 2015 by ESPN. When Scout.com released its first list of 5-star rated football players on August 12, 2013, Campbell was included among the 20 players listed and the only wide receiver included. At the end of that summer prior to his junior year football season, he was one of two juniors selected to the 2013 USA Today preseason All-USA team. He accepted an invitation to participate in the 2015 Under Armour All-America Game in St. Petersburg before the end of October 2013. The November 15 FHSAA Class 7A region quarterfinal that East Lake won 13–12 ended with an alleged punch by a Palmetto High School coach that left Campbell with a cut inside his mouth. Other players were involved in the altercation, which <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>investigated</b> by the FHSAA. On November 19, 2013, ESPN moved Campbell up to the number two overall position in the class of 2015. This moved him ahead of Kevin Toliver II, but he remained behind Jashon Cornell. In Campbell's third time in the FHSAA, East Lake finally got past the regional finals (defeating Port Charlotte High School), only to lose the following week on December 6, 2013, in the state semifinals in overtime to Dwyer High School 31–24, despite a 65-yard touchdown reception by Campbell. Following the season, Campbell decommitted from Michigan on December 13.|$|E
