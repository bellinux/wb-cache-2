After experimental irradiation and syngeneic bone marrow transplantation in mice, macrophages show reduced repopulation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> compared with that in other tissues. Macrophages are major microbicidal immune effector cells in host pulmonary defense. Therefore, we examined the role of locally applied cytokines for macrophage repopulation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung.</b> An accelerated repopulation of macrophages <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> was observed after intranasal application of macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), but this effect was not enhanced by a combination of M-CSF with interleukin (IL) - 3. Local proliferation contributed to this effect.

The role of M-CSF treatment was determined in pulmonary murine cytomegalovirus infection using an irradiation/reconstitution model. The M-CSF treatment had no effect on virus load <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> tissue. However, phosphate-buffered saline-treated mice seemed to develop stronger inflammation after viral infection than M-CSF-treated mice.

5|$|Low oxygen levels and, eventually, {{high carbon}} dioxide {{levels in the}} blood can occur from poor gas {{exchange}} due to decreased ventilation from airway obstruction, hyperinflation and a reduced desire to breathe. During exacerbations, airway inflammation is also increased, resulting in increased hyperinflation, reduced expiratory airflow and worsening of gas transfer. This {{can also lead to}} insufficient ventilation and, eventually, low blood oxygen levels. Low oxygen levels, if present for a prolonged period, can result in narrowing of the arteries <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lungs,</b> while emphysema leads to breakdown of capillaries <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lungs.</b> Both these changes result in increased blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries, which may cause cor pulmonale.|$|E

40|$|Background Asthmatic {{inflammation}} {{is mediated}} by {{a network of}} cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules. Corticosteroids are the only effective agents available to control asthmatic inflammation. We investigated the effect of high-dose montelukast (MK), a selective cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 antagonist, on mediators of airway inflammation. Objective The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the effect of a 3 -day course of high-dose MK on mediators of airway inflammation induced by a single allergen challenge in sensitized mice. Methods Ovalbumin (OVA) -sensitized BALB/c mice were treated with 25 mg/kg of MK or saline intravenously for 3 days. On the third day, a single inhalation challenge with OVA was given. Cellular infiltration was assessed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung.</b> Expression of IL- 4, IL- 5, IL- 13 and eotaxin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> BAL, and <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> was determined. Serum IL- 5 and total IgE was measured. IL- 5 and eotaxin mRNA expression <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> was determined. Finally, eotaxin and VACM- 1 expression <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Results MK reduced the number of eosinophils <b>in</b> <b>the</b> BAL by > 90 %. There was also significant reduction in IL- 5 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> BAL, <b>lung</b> and <b>the</b> serum, and IL- 5 mRNA expression <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung.</b> IL- 4 level <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> and BAL, and IL- 13 level <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> also significantly decreased. Serum IgE level and lung VCAM- 1 expression was also significantly lower in treated animals, but eotaxin protein and mRNA expression <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> remained unchanged. Conclusion MK exerts its anti-inflammatory effect through the suppression of T helper type- 2 (Th 2) cytokines. The use of high-dose MK as an anti-inflammatory agent in acute asthma should be further explored...|$|R

30|$|As {{additional}} indicators of tissue fibrosis, {{we examined the}} expression of α-SMA and TGF-β.
