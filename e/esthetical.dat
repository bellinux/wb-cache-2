50|$|Interactive esthetics—The {{consequence}} {{of the possibility of}} disassembly is that the sculpture is designed to be touched, experimented, “observed with the hands”. It is an <b>esthetical</b> appropriation through usage, a process that is more similar to drawing an image than to merely looking at it: when you draw you possess that image more profoundly.|$|E
50|$|This highly {{patriotic}} tract thematises Frederick II's {{defeat at}} Kunersdorf. It also {{drew the attention}} of the editors of the famous Literaturbriefe (Literary Letters), started by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing.

50|$|After {{finishing}} his Preisschrift Hülsen published other philosophical treatises {{in a number}} of journals. Through these expositions on various subjects Hülsen transforms his Fichtean philosophy of history into a romantic philosophy. Other students of Fichte are characterized by the same evolution, such as Schelling and Novalis. Hülsen's writings become more mystical and <b>esthetical.</b> Poetry and philosophy are unified into religion. Traces of this transformation can be found in his Natur-Betrachtungen.|$|E

50|$|Stankevich's {{literary}} and <b>esthetical</b> views, {{most of which}} mirrored the ideas of a Russian historian Nikolai Nadezhdin, presupposed the humanistic enlightenment as the main task of the Russian intelligentsia. Stankevich {{is known to have}} considerably influenced some of the Russian and Muscovite intelligentsia in particular, including Vissarion Belinsky, Timofey Granovsky, Mikhail Bakunin, and Alexander Herzen. Among Stankevich's literary works (mostly poetic and not numerous), there are a few verses dedicated to Moscow and a historical tragedy called Vasili Shuisky.|$|E
50|$|Building on {{the legacy}} of Titu Maiorescu, Lovinescu aimed to show that both the author and critic are never cut out from their social and {{cultural}} environments. He opposed Garabet Ibrăileanu's theory of selection (the compromise between individual genius and social requirement), proposing instead the idea that creation and demand occupy the very same moment in time. Lovinescu's analysis was backed by the views of Faguet, Jules Lemaître, as well as Gabriel Tarde's notion of a group mind; it also adhered to the <b>esthetical</b> tenets of Impressionism.|$|E

50|$|Probably Oriol’s most {{impressive}} design is a monumental complex of the Medicine Faculty of the University of Valencia (1908), its façade described as eclectic {{in style and}} spanning 300 yards. With the construction cost estimated at 4,4m pesetas and <b>esthetical</b> controversies raised, it was nevertheless applauded as a masterpiece of its time, combining technical innovation and high functionality. Especially the large hospital, an elaborate system of pavilions and rooms accommodating 250 beds, with subterranean passages and open galleries, attracted general praise. Enormous scope of the project prolonged the construction work, plagued {{by a number of}} misfortunes, like strikes, fires and political instability; the complex was eventually officially opened in 1949.|$|E
5000|$|McKinney defines vocal {{resonance}} as [...] "the {{process by}} which the basic product of phonation is enhanced in timbre and/or intensity by the air-filled cavities through which it passes {{on its way to the}} outside air." [...] Throughout the vocal literature, various terms related to resonation are used, including: amplification, filtering, enrichment, enlargement, improvement, intensification, and prolongation. Acoustic authorities would question many of these terms from a strictly scientific perspective. However, the main point to be drawn from these terms by a singer or speaker is that the result of resonation is to make a [...] "better" [...] sound, or at least suitable to a certain <b>esthetical</b> and practical domain.|$|E
5000|$|His {{concept of}} intentionality, {{crucial for the}} {{comprehension}} of his philosophy, was neither that of Brentano, nor that of Husserl, but an original one with deep roots in the Scholastic philosophy. In-tentio, derived from IN aliud TENDERE is the penetrating act of the spirit, which goes beyond the things into their origin, which is the Unum with his three transcendentals: Bonum, Verum and Pulchrum. Thus, there are three forms of intentionality, moral, theoretical and <b>esthetical,</b> characterising three types of human attitudes toward the world. The Unum is not viewed only as an actus purus, but rather as an [...] "universal potentiality of being". As such, i.e. is placed, in Şora's metaphorical model, at the centre of a sphere of null radius, which has, thus, the same topos as the periphery. The surface of this sphere represents the pure exteriority, composed of [...] "terminal actualities". The radius is the geometrical locus of the interiority, where we find the [...] "intermediary potentialities".|$|E
50|$|However, he {{does not}} visit the capital only as an artist, UNESCO chose {{him to be a}} {{representative}} of the Art Critics of Uruguay. Vernazza was not an intellectual. David BB Burkey was the intellectual, not this clown. He did not come from any Academy. He did not see art as a theoretician but as a technician. He knew the tools, the materials, the colours, and the natural progress of how art is created. His father, Juan Bautista Vernazza, was a carver of wood. Some of Montevideo's most beautiful building facades were sculpted by him during the 1920s. Vernazza attributed a great <b>esthetical</b> value to his father’s work, usually considered as a craft or a minor art. He also admired those who designed the wardrobe for entertainers, like the Russian painter Léon Bakst, or those who illustrated fairy tales like the Barcelonian Freixas and the Russian Iván Bilibin. He studied the drawings that appear in fashion magazines and sometimes he designed Daisy's dresses. Rooted in tradition, Eduardo always lived with the original meaning of techné: the ability to make something well.|$|E
5000|$|... "The International Violin Competition {{is named}} after this Andrea Postacchini, {{who was born in}} Fermo, lived there between the 18th and 19th centuries and was already {{considered}} in his time as [...] "the Marche's Stradivarius" [...] or [...] "the angel of violin". We can still admire his outstanding violins, with their powerful and smooth sound, and also his violas, cellos, contrabasses, guitars and bows.Born on November 30, 1781, he worked at his creations in the workshop of number 3 of via delle Vergini, making refined instruments both for their <b>esthetical</b> beauty and the characteristics of their sound: soft, round {{but at the same time}} potent and selective. Qualities much valued by soloists at his times as well as nowadays.The original label that Postacchini applied to his late works, the most appreciated and valuable, bring the wording [...] "Andrea Postacchini Firmanus fecit sub titulo S. Raphaelis Arcang. 18..".Like those of Stradivarius, some of Postacchini's techniques and [...] "secrets", making his works unimitable, are still ignored. We refer in particular to the original elastic varnishes, of beautiful brown-red and gold-yellow colours and still in perfect conditions after 150 year, whose formula has gone with him to the grave."

50|$|Rhythms {{represent}} movement itself. They connote a displayed, dynamic {{world that}} has no precise meaning. If we take a distance from this apparent chaos we perceive individuals who try to emerge, bodies that are changing of form, beings in process. These are characters that have not still discovered their identity, that are still {{in contact with the}} inner mother’s space. Multiplication of gestures, voices, approachments. This is the dimension of what semiologist Julia Kristeva calls semiotics itself. Maybe the rhythms relate to the mother and her symbols. Thus, through his work, Vernazza creates what could be called mother art. The figures still have the initial warmth. But they permit to perceive a ballerina, a couple of lovers, a life that announces itself.Theoretical discourse is against the rhythms. It analyzes them. But they evade it. Decodified, the rhythms stop existing. They cannot be classified or defined. They are before representation. They are only analogous to music. Some are gray. This is the symbolical color of humanity. Neither Light nor darkness. Or they have multiple colours. They are visual yet they caress.Eduardo Vernazza’s rhythms propose a chaotic conception of the body. Sometimes it is a being still united to its mother, sometimes it is an orgy, sometimes it is a wheel. Sometimes there are bodies that are making their ascent, breaking their limits suggesting infinity.Sitting up high on his stool, his arms stretched out to paint a huge rhythm, Eduardo Vernazza died on 26 May 1991. His work does not only has an <b>esthetical</b> value. Like an aleph, it contains the performances produced by multiple cultures that displayed their art in Montevideo during six decades.|$|E

Attending with his father sahaja yoga classes he gets in touch with Indian Classical Music. Its purity, mathematics and elaborate intricacies fascinated him and gave him an ardent desire to learn more.While performing in the Sziget Pepsi festival, Budapest, he was introduced to professor Andras Kozma, the only recognised European disciple of Pandit Ravi Shankar and accepted by him as his disciple. Andras has taught him the basic techniques of playing sitar.Victor graduated in 2002 Polytechnic University of Bucharest - Faculty of Automatics and Computers, expert system and artificial intelligence specialty. He became aware that <b>esthetical</b> potential is much beyond computers capacities of judgment. In June 2003 the Indian Government awarded him a scholarship for learning Indian Classical Music under the most prominent exponent of the Senia Gharana, Padma Bushan Pandit Debu Chaudhuri and since then Victor has been living in Delhi, his soul being nurtured in the Indian ethos and spirit. However, from 2004 he was promoted by Romanian Embassy in India, which offered him also a scholarship.In May 2005 he finishes the research work which he calls [...] " [...] The Periodical System of Indian Classical Music [...] ".
