As of September 2017, Euro 6 emission regulations will limit particle numbers at a maximum of 6 x 1011 per kilometre over the New European Driving Cycle.

The stock-GDI vehicle emits graphitized fractal-like aggregates over all driving conditions. The mean projected area-equivalent diameter of these aggregates is in the 78. 42 ̆ 01288. 4 nm range and the mean diameter of primary particles varies between 24. 6 and 26. 6 nm. Post-GPF particles emitted over the US 06 cycle appear to have an amorphous structure, and a large number of nucleation-mode particles, depicted as low-contrast ultrafine droplets, are observed in TEM images. This indicates the emission of a substantial amount of semivolatile material during the US 06 cycle, most likely generated by the incomplete combustion of accumulated soot in the GPF during regeneration. The size of primary particles and soot aggregates does not vary significantly by implementing the GPF over the FTP- 75 cycle; however, particles emitted by the GPF-equipped vehicle over the US 06 cycle are about 20...|$|R
40|$|Stringent {{regulations}} worldwide {{will limit}} {{the level of}} particulate matter (PM) emitted from gasoline engines equipped with direct fuel injection. <b>Gasoline</b> particulate <b>filters</b> (GPFs) present one strategy for meeting PM limits over the full operating range of the engine. Over time these filters accumulate incombustible ash, increasing system pressure drop and adversely effecting engine performance. The effect of aging {{as a result of}} ash accumulation is examined over the full lifetime of <b>gasoline</b> particulate <b>filters,</b> using a novel accelerated aging system. This system utilizes a gasoline combustion chamber into which lubricating oil is injected simulating combustion in the power cylinder - the primary source of lubricant-derived ash. Advanced imaging techniques are used to characterize filter and particulate emission behavior, and compare to prior data from diesel filters of the same type. Likewise, pressure drop behavior is observed for multiple filter samples and compared to prior experiments. A collocated Gasoline Direct Injection engine was installed for comparative purposes; a method of testing engine performance with GPF installations was developed and the engine was prepared and instrumented for future testing. This report details the construction and validation of the accelerated aging system, examination and comparison of results to those from prior experiments, and confirmation of principal assumptions used in developing the experimental test matrix. This study is one of a very few completed in a unique, emerging field of study, driven by new and extremely stringent emissions regulations around the globe.

40|$|The recent {{introduction}} of a Particle Number (PN) limit of 6 × 1011 #/km for all Direct Injection Gasoline (G-DI) vehicles registered in Europe after September 2017, is expected to necessitate a widespread application of <b>Gasoline</b> Particulate <b>Filters</b> (GPF). It is therefore important to assess whether the associated implementation costs can be justified {{on the basis of}} the societal benefits. Monetary valuation of externalities originating from the reduction of PN and Black Carbon (BC) emissions, accounting for any fuel consumption and CO 2 penalties, provided evidence that a GPF installation can be a cost effective solution.

Among all the samples tested, the most promising one is a GPF equipped with a SiC filtration membrane on which a catalytic layer has been washcoated. This cGPF combines good filtering efficiency, due to the membrane, and remarkable catalytic performances in presence of soot and water. The catalytic performance is greater than those of a commercial TC, in spite of a 9 times lower platinum group metal loading.

40|$|Recently, a novel method {{emerged to}} {{determine}} the oxygen storage degree of three way catalysts (TWC) by a microwave-based method. Up to now, this method has been investigated only in lab-scale reactors or under steady state conditions. This work expands those initial studies. A TWC-coated <b>gasoline</b> particulate <b>filter</b> was investigated in a dynamic engine test bench simulating a typical European driving cycle (NEDC). It could be shown that both the oxygen storage degree and the soot loading can be monitored directly, but not simultaneously due to their competitive effects. Under normal driving conditions, no soot accumulation was observed, related to the low raw emissions and the catalytic coating of the filter. For the first time, the quality factor of the cavity resonator {{in addition to the}} resonance frequency was used, with the benefit of less cross sensitivity to inconstant temperature and water. Therefore, a temperature dependent calibration of the microwave signal was created and applied to monitor the oxidation state in transient driving cycles. The microwave measurement mirrors the oxidation state determined by lambda probes and can be highly beneficial in start-stop phases (where lambda-probes do not work) and {{to determine the}} oxygen storage capacity (OSC) without unnecessary emissions...|$|R
40|$|Modern Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) engines offer {{increased}} power output, improved {{fuel economy}} and reduced CO 2 emissions. However, the increased particulate matter (PM) emission level still remains a challenging task. Understanding PM {{features such as}} morphological and microstructural parameters through transmission electron microscopy can provide information about their formation, filtration and soot oxidation processes in the <b>gasoline</b> particulate <b>filters</b> {{and their impact on}} human health. This research article characterises PM emitted from a 2 L 4 -cylinder GDI engine at two injection timings: (i) ECU settings which produces PM with high volatile content and (ii) advanced injection timing to increase soot formation rate. Primary particle size distributions formed by volatile nature PM, present a higher standard deviation than for the sooty PM, while the former ones presented higher fractal dimension. In addition, five different methods of estimating PM fractal dimension reported in the GDI literature have also been compared and it was concluded that the arising trends were in agreement. The effect of high percentages of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and reformate gas combustion on PM characteristics have been analysed. EGR does not have a significant effect in PM morphology. On the other hand, reformate combustion reduces the size of the primary particle and the agglomerates as well as increasing the fractal dimension...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{concerns of}} greenhouse gases and deprived air quality have compelled researchers and vehicle manufacturers to investigate more efficient vehicle powertrains. Gasoline direct injection (GDI) engines, as opposed to previous spark ignited technologies are capable of reducing fuel consumption, and therefore CO_ 2 emissions. However, the main drawback is the increased level of particulate matter (PM) emissions due to the more heterogeneous mixture formation in GDI engines. Therefore, upcoming emission standards will include gasoline engines in PM legislation. The aim of this investigation is to characterise PM (size, shape and composition), as the lung deposition rate, atmospheric residence time and soot oxidation patterns are highly dependent on PM characteristics. Understanding these properties will also aid {{in the design of}} more efficient aftertreatment devices targeting the specific features of PM present in GDI exhausts. In this work, on-board reforming has been used to generate a rich-in-hydrogen gas. Hydrogen combustion has been observed to reduce particle number concentration significantly without affecting the oxidation behaviour or the nanostructure properties of the soot whilst reducing CO_ 2 emissions. In addition to this, the performance of <b>gasoline</b> particulate <b>filters</b> has been assessed as well as the role of the three way catalyst in PM reduction. ...|$|R
40|$|Particulate matter (PM) is a toxic {{pollutant}} formed {{during the}} combustion {{of fossil fuels}} inside the engine of our cars. PM is composed by a carbonaceous core, known as soot onto which different hydrocarbon species can be adsorbed. The detrimental effects of PM on humans are varied; it can exacerbate allergies and provoke respiratory-related illnesses. In addition, PM is linked with cardiovascular problems and the increased rate of cancer {{on account of the}} mutagenic behaviour of the majority of PM components. Also, PM is not innocuous to the environment. Soot can absorb sunlight warming the low atmosphere and PM {{is one of the main}} causes of historical building damage and soiling. Traditionally, PM emissions have been associated to diesel vehicles, however, with the introduction of Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) engines, petrol powertrains are also in the spotlight for current legislation. In Europe, the Euro 6 c, which will come into force in September 2017, imposes a level of 6 x 1011 particulates emitted per kilometre. PM can be reduced and controlled from different points of view i) engine calibration ii) fuel reformulation and iii) efficient aftertreatment systems (i. e. <b>gasoline</b> particulate <b>filters).</b> Thus, the aim of my thesis is to study the intrinsic properties of PM under different engine conditions and alternative fuels in order to aid in the design of efficient pathways to reduce PM in GDI engines...|$|R
40|$|Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) engines {{represent}} a promising technology for facing the {{more and more}} stringent limits imposed by emission regulations. However, one of the drawbacks of GDI engines compared to PFI engines is the production of soot. One of the possible solutions {{to reduce the amount}} of soot emitted in the atmosphere, among the different existent strategies, is the <b>Gasoline</b> Particulate <b>Filter</b> (GPF). Nowadays, the most common device in cars for monitoring the filter state and trigger the regeneration event is the differential pressure sensor. However, this provides an indirect measure of the soot state of the filter using a predictive model implemented in the Electronic Control Unit (ECU). A valid alternative, in laboratory environment, is represented by the Radio Frequency sensor. The objective of the study is to determine if a correlation exists between the output of the RF sensor and the amount of soot in the filter. The final outcome will be an analytical model that uses the average forward gain recorded from the Radio Frequency sensor and the exhaust gas temperature that can be used to estimate the amount of soot on the filter during both loading and regeneration phases. Moreover, with the output of the model during the regeneration event, it will be possible to understand when the soot oxidation starts and to distinguish the different soot reactivity, i. e. how it differently oxidizes during regeneration...|$|R
40|$|We {{assessed}} {{three different}} technical approaches to tackle Particle Number (PN) emissions from stoichiometric direct injection gasoline vehicles under both regulated and unregulated conditions. The most efficient measure {{was found to}} be the installation of a <b>gasoline</b> particulate <b>filter</b> which, with a filtration efficiency of more than 90 %, effectively reduced the PN emission below the legislated diesel threshold of 6 × 1011 #/km, under all operating conditions examined. The use of 75 - 85 % ethanol/gasoline blends on a flexi fuel vehicle resulted in large reductions in PN emissions, which spanned from approximately 20 - 35 % under urban driving to an excess of 95 % at motorway conditions. The emission performance of a Euro 4 vehicle utilizing a twin port/direct injection system verified the PN reduction potential offered by such strategies, exhibiting emissions in the 3 7 × 1011 #/km range over all hot-start tests. The fraction of nano-sized non-volatile particles that could not be detected with the legislated PN measurement procedure ranged between 10 - 35 %, that is within the levels reported for late technology diesel vehicles (Mamakos et al., 2012. Journal of Aerosol Science, 55 : 31 - 47).

The vehicle tests were performed under the Federal Test Procedure- 75 (FTP- 75) and the Highway Fuel Economy Test (HWFET) modes. Particle number (PN) concentrations, size distributions, and the filtering efficiency with the GPF were evaluated with a condensation particle counter (CPC) and a differential mobility spectrometer (DMS 500). Under steady engine operating conditions, the PN concentrations at the engine-out position were 9. 7 × 105 – 2. 5 × 106 N/cc. While, the PN concentrations after the GPF were 9. 2 × 104 – 3. 5 × 105 N/cc, and the PN was reduced by 77 %– 96 %. The PN filtering efficiency with the GPF-GDI vehicle reached approximately 58 % in the FTP- 75 and 62 % in the HWFET mode. The PN {{concentration of the}} GPF-GDI vehicle was significantly reduced to 3. 95 × 1011 N/km for the FTP- 75 and 8. 86 × 1010 N/km for the HWFET mode.

The organic and elemental carbon fractions of the carbonaceous PM and transmission electron microscope (TEM) images for the exhaust particles were examined. Particles emitted from the GDI vehicle over various moderate driving conditions have similar morphology, size, and composition. These accumulation mode particles have diameters of 50 to 90 nm, have comparable fractal structures to diesel particles, and contain mostly BC with little organic materials. Under aggressive driving conditions, many nanoparticles (< 20 nm in diameter) are emitted with the accumulation mode particles. Over the FTP- 75 driving conditions, the optimized GPF reaches particle filtration efficiency of over 90 % from clean condition rapidly and filtration efficiency remains unchanged as filter regeneration was not observed. Over the US 06 driving condition, filter regeneration was triggered by the high exhaust temperature during which many nanoparticles with diameters smaller than 30 nm are formed downstream of the GPF. TEM image analysis suggests that BC particles collected during the filter regeneration contain a layer of semi-volatile materials on the aggregate surface while the nanoparticles were semi-volatile in nature. During filter regeneration, moderate filtration of the accumulation mode BC particles was still observed. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to perform a comparison of exhaust composition and biological responses from freshly produced non-filtered exhaust as well as from exhaust filtered with a noncoated <b>gasoline</b> particle <b>filter</b> (GPF). A 3 D model of the human epithelial airway barrier was exposed to the exhaust directly at the air-liquid interface and different effects such as cytotoxicity, antioxidative response, pro- inflammation, and activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) were studied. In addition, genotoxicity was assessed using the Ames test. By an online analysis of the exhaust, it has been shown that the GPF efficiently filters the particle count in both the cold and warm phase when the new European driving cycle (NEDC) was applied. The lung cell tests revealed that the use of the GPF increased the antioxidative glutathionine (GSH) response as well as the pro-inflammatory potential, i. e., IL- 8, expression, indicating increased cell stimulation by the volatile compounds alone. The removal of the particulate fraction, however, decreased significantly the AhR activation in comparison to unfiltered exhaust, and the exhaust genotoxicity was reduced as tested by the Ames test. In conclusion, GPF exhaust did not completely reduce the adverse effects of gasoline exhaust in the in vitro test and further experiments with a coated GPF are needed in the future...|$|R
40|$|International @ AIR+MTS:CZA:ABO:PVEInternational audienceEuropean {{standards}} for Diesel cars restrict the particulate matter emissions by combining a limit number (PN: 6. 0 × 1011 particulates/km) with a limit mass (PM: 4. 5 mg/km) {{as well as}} durability of after-treatment system. From 2014, PN and PM limits are also introduced for the approval of gasoline-fuelled vehicles. While conventional Port Fuel Injection (PFI) gasoline vehicles can easily comply with these limits, their Direct Injection (GDI) counterparts are found to emit systematically above this threshold by up to 1. 5 orders of magnitude [1, 2]. The Euro 6 b legislations will tolerate a PN limit at 6. 0 × 1012 particulates/km for these GDI vehicles but this standard will be strengthened from 2017 (Euro 6 c) to reach the level of Diesel cars. It is therefore expected that GDI vehicles may require the installation of <b>Gasoline</b> Particulate <b>Filters</b> (GPF). At the same time, the penetration of GDI vehicles is expected to rapidly grow {{in the near future}} in both the European and the US markets. This is due to their improved fuel efficiency compared to the conventional PFIs as well as their ability to be implemented in hydride cars. Therefore, it is of strong interest to develop catalysts for the regeneration of GPF. Comparing to Diesel ones, GDI exhausts contain much lower amounts of oxygen. The scientific issue consists in the development of catalysts effective for soot oxidation at low oxygen levels. For cost and sustainability reasons, it is also necessary to avoid the utilization of noble metals.

The same limit will also apply to diesel light duty vehicles but {{with a one year}} delay (09 / 2014 for type approvals and 09 / 2015 for all new registered vehicles). The regulation states that a Particle Number (PN) limit will also be introduced for the certification of Euro 6 technology gasoline-fuelled vehicles but the threshold value was not decided yet. While conventional Port Fuel Injection (PFI) gasoline vehicles can easily comply with the diesel limit, their Direct Injection (G-DI) counterparts are found to emit systematically above this threshold by up to 1 ½ orders of magnitude. It is therefore expected that application of the diesel particle number limit to G-DI vehicles may necessitate the installation of a particulate filter. At the same time, the penetration of G-DI vehicles is expected to rapidly grow in the near future in both the European and USA markets. This is due to their improved fuel efficiency compared to the conventional PFIs, that would potentially enable the target set in both EU and USA on the fleet-average carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions of future vehicles. It is foreseen that this vehicle category will dominate the gasoline market eventually replacing the conventional and less efficient PFI vehicles.

40|$|New {{regulations}} in the United States and Europe, {{designed to address}} climate change concerns by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, are causing increased use of gasoline direct-injection (GDI) engines in light-duty vehicles (LDV). Separate new regulations that aim to reduce particulate emissions to address air pollution concerns are taking effect concurrent with greenhouse gas limitations in both jurisdictions. GDI engines are proven to create more particulate emissions than previously utilized port-injection technology. Increasing particulate emissions rates combined with falling regulatory particulate emissions limits requires new strategies to reduce these emissions from gasoline powered LDVs. Particulate filters have been successfully implemented to reduce particulate emissions from diesel engine exhaust for over a decade. Diesel particulate filters have a demonstrated filtration efficiency of 95 % or greater and have reduced diesel particulate mass (PM) emissions by one to two orders of magnitude. GDI engines require {{no more than one}} order of magnitude reduction in particulate emissions to meet new regulations. Existing particulate filter technology in use in diesel vehicles is capable of reducing GDI engine emissions to new regulatory levels; however, it is proposed that these reduction may be achievable through means other than <b>gasoline</b> particulate <b>filters</b> (GPF). A GPF will create an additional back-pressure in the engine exhaust system that will reduce engine power and efficiency. This backpressure will increase as PM is trapped in the filter and decrease as combustible PM removed. A buildup of incombustible ash present in engine-out PM will increase the baseline backpressure of the filter during the course of its service life. It is important to understand the impact of ash on the filter pressure drop performance before implementing GPF to meet new emissions regulations. This study builds on existing diesel particulate filter technology and demonstrates through experimental results the mechanisms by which ash increases GPF pressure drop. Ash deposits are also shown to increase the light-off temperature of three-way catalyst coatings in GPF. by Nicholas C. Custer. Thesis: S. M. in Mechanical Engineering, and S.

40|$|Aerosols have {{a direct}} effect on climate, through {{reflection}} of solar radiation and indirectly as seeds for cloud formation; cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). There is however, a large uncertainty {{in our understanding of}} the contributions of aerosols to climate change. It is therefore imperative to explore the chemical and physical properties of aerosol that influence CCN activity and droplet kinetics. This dissertation investigates the effects of aerosol mixing states, chemical composition and photochemical aging on the CCN forming potential of ambient salts and combustion aerosol. Using customized instrumentation and algorithms, the CCN droplet kinetics of inorganic salts and photochemically aged combustion aerosol is also evaluated. The droplet growth of inorganic and organic salts and the effects of cloud condensation nuclei concentrations on the final droplet sizes were explored with a modified, higher sensitivity optical particle counter (OPC). From the higher sensitivity OPC data, the final droplet diameters of CCN appear independent of aerosol hygroscopicity but strongly dependent on the CCN concentration. We also evaluated the effects of excess non-condensable gases on the CCN activation and droplet kinetics in a cloud condensation nuclei counter (CCNc). Excess, heavier gases increased mass transfer of water vapor and modified the supersaturation in the CCNc column. The CCN activity and droplet kinetics of aged anthropogenic primary and biogenic aerosol was evaluated. CCN activity and droplet kinetics of α-pinene SOA formed in an atmospheric reactor and mixed with diesel or motor oil-fuel primary organic aerosol (POA) was characterized by the single parameter κ-hygroscopicity. Results showed that a similarity in the CCN activity of organic aerosol may indicate a propensity for mixing.

40|$|Exhaust from {{vehicles}} {{is one of}} {{the leading}} contributors of particulate matter (PM) in the atmosphere. PM has been shown to be carcinogenic and to pose a significant risk to human health. Therefore, continuously stricter legislation is being implemented for particulate emissions. Diesel engines are the highest emitters of PM in the exhaust. Due to this, diesel particulate matter has been studied since the 1980 ?s and diesel particulate filters (DPFs) have been in use to reduce diesel PM since 2003. Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) engines have penetrated the automotive market due to their increased fuel efficiency and high power output. However, due to incomplete fuel volatilization and partially fuel-rich zones, GDI engines tend to produce more particulate matter as compared to conventional spark ignition engines. To aid in reducing PM, GDI engines could benefit from a particulate filter system like diesels have. However, adding a filter in the exhaust system is known to increase backpressure in the exhaust, which is especially problematic for GDI operation and can lead to a fuel penalty. To minimize the fuel penalty associated with these particulate filters, there is ongoing research to improve both the filter media and the regeneration strategy; the second is the focus of this work. To efficiently regenerate a <b>Gasoline</b> Particulate <b>Filter</b> (GPF), the reactivity of GDI particulate matter must be understood. Previous work has shown that diesel particulate matter formation, nanostructure and reactivity is a function of fuel type. With ethanol being the leading and currently deployed biofuel for gasoline engines, there is interest in studying the effect it has on GDI PM reactivity. This study investigated the reaction kinetics through Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO) and Desorption (TPD) experiments, which yield bulk reactivity characterizations and quantified the volatile organic fraction, respectively. Isothermal Pulsed Oxidation (IPO) experiments determined the activation energies to be 171. 7 kJ/mol for GDI E 0 PM and 227. 4 kJ/mol and for GDI E 30 PM. For heterogeneous reactions, such as our solid-gas reactions, surface area is a surrogate measurement for the concentration of the solid phase.

40|$|Gasoline direct {{injection}} (GDI) vehicles {{have recently been}} identified as a significant source of carbonaceous aerosol, of both primary and secondary origin. Here we investigated primary emissions and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation from GDI vehicle exhaust for multiple vehicles and driving test cycles, and novel GDI after-treatment systems. Emissions were characterized by proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (gaseous non-methane organic compounds, NMOCs), aerosol mass spectrometry (sub-micron non-refractory particles), and light attenuation measurements (equivalent black carbon (eBC) determination using Aethalometer measurements) together with supporting instrumentation. We evaluated the effect of retrofitted prototype <b>gasoline</b> particle <b>filters</b> (GPFs) on primary eBC, organic aerosol (OA), NMOCs, as well as SOA formation. Two regulatory driving test cycles were investigated, and the importance of distinct phases within these cycles (e. g. cold engine start, hot engine start, high speed driving) to primary emissions and secondary products was evaluated. Atmospheric processing was simulated using both the PSI mobile smog chamber (SC) and the potential aerosol mass oxidation flow reactor (OFR). GPF retrofitting was found to greatly decrease primary particulate matter (PM) through removal of eBC, but showed limited partial removal of the minor POA fraction, and had no detectable effect on either NMOC emissions (absolute emission factors or relative composition) or SOA production. In all tests, overall primary and secondary PM and NMOC emissions were dominated by the engine cold start, i. e. before thermal activation of the catalytic after-treatment system. Differences were found in the bulk compositional properties of SOA produced by the OFR and the SC (O : C and H : C ratios), while the SOA yields agree within our uncertainties, with a tendency for lower SOA yields in SC experiments. A few aromatic compounds are found to dominate the NMOC emissions (primarily benzene, toluene, xylene isomers and C 3 -benzenes). A large fraction (> 0. 5) of the SOA production was explained by those compounds, based on investigation of reacted NMOC mass and comparison with SOA yield curves of toluene, o-xylene and 1, 2, 4 -trimethylbenzene determined in our OFR within this study. Remaining differences in the obtained SOA yields may result from diverse reasons including aging conditions, unaccounted-for precursors and differences in SOA yields of aromatic hydrocarbons with different degrees of substitution, as well as experimental uncertainties in the assessment of particle and vapor wall losses...|$|R
40|$|The study {{assesses the}} {{feasibility}} of introducing the regulated particle number measurement procedure for the regulation of gasoline vehicles, focusing on the established cut-off size of 23 nm. A range of late technology gasoline vehicles were tested under regulated and unregulated test conditions. The results indicated a distinct emission behavior of Direct Injection Gasolines (G-DI), Port Fuel Injection gasolines (PFI) and Diesels equipped with Particulate Filters (DPF), that differed {{both in terms of}} the absolute levels but also with respect to the fraction of undetected nano-sized non-volatile particles. The latter was found to be around 20 % (based on comparisons with a Condensation Particle Counter (CPC) having a 50 % cut-off size at 4. 5 nm) for three G-DI vehicles tested, but ranged between 40 and 70 % for the two PFIs measured. Interestingly, a relatively large fraction of undetected nanosized was also observed for two late technology DPFs, ranging between 30 and 50 %. To a large extent these differences originate from differences in the size distributions and the relatively blunt shape of the counting efficiency curve of PMP compliant CPCs. Under conditions favouring nucleation mode formation in the dilution tunnel, excessive particle concentrations were detected by the low cut-off size CPCs, and especially the one with a d 50 at 4. 5 nm, that could exceed those of the PMP compliant CPC by up to one order of magnitude. However, the concentration of these nano-sized particles was found to decrease with increasing the dilution ratio in the first stage of the Volatile Particle Remover (VPR), indicating that this is rather a volatile artifact possibly originating from re-nucleation of evaporated material downstream of the VPR. The study also investigated the potential offered by a range of available approaches to effectively control particle emissions from G-DIs. These included the use of a <b>Gasoline</b> Particulate <b>Filter</b> (GPF), the introduction of ethanol in the fuel but also an advanced engine concept combining port and direct fuel injection. The GPF system was found to very efficient in controlling particle number emissions under all driving conditions, having no visible impact on carbon dioxide emissions. The use of fuel with hi-ethanol content (75 - 85 %) was also found to be beneficial especially at high engine loads (up to 97 % reduction of non-volatile particle numbers) and during cold start operation (up to 70 % reduction). The tests with the “hybrid” G-DI-PFI vehicle indicated that there exists the potential for significant reduction of PM formation through engine measures. The non-volatile particle number emissions of this vehicle remained below the diesel limit over all hot start tests. JRC. F. 8 -Sustainable Transpor...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new mobile {{environmental}} reaction chamber for the simulation of the atmospheric aging of aerosols from different emissions sources without limitation from the instruments or facilities available at any single site. The chamber can be {{mounted on a}} trailer for transport to host facilities or for mobile measurements. Photochemistry is simulated using a set of 40 UV lights (total power 4 KW). Characterisation of the emission spectrum of these lights shows that atmospheric photochemistry can be accurately simulated over a range of temperatures from − 7 – 25 °C. A photolysis rate of NO 2 , JNO 2 , of (8. 0 &plusmn; 0. 7) &times; 10 − 3 molecules cm− 3 s− 1 was determined at 25 °C. Further, we present the first application of the mobile chamber and demonstrate its utility by quantifying primary organic aerosol (POA) emission and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) production from a Euro 5 light duty gasoline vehicle. Exhaust emissions were sampled during the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC), the standard driving cycle for European regulatory purposes, and injected into the chamber. The relative concentrations of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and total hydrocarbon (THC) during the aging of emissions inside the chamber were controlled using an injection system developed {{as a part of}} the new mobile chamber set up. Total OA (POA + SOA) emission factors of (370 &plusmn; 18) &times; 10 &minus; 3 g kg&minus; 1 fuel, or (14. 6 &plusmn; 0. 8) &times; 10 &minus; 3 g km&minus; 1 , after aging, were calculated from concentrations measured inside the smog chamber during two experiments. The average SOA/POA ratio for the two experiments was 15. 1, a much larger increase than has previously been seen for diesel vehicles, where smog chamber studies have found SOA/POA ratios of 1. 3 – 1. 7. Due to this SOA formation, carbonaceous particulate matter (PM) emissions from a gasoline vehicle may approach those of a diesel vehicle of the same class. Furthermore, with the advent of emission controls requiring the use of diesel particle <b>filters,</b> <b>gasoline</b> vehicle emissions could become a far larger source of ambient PM than diesel vehicles. Therefore this large increase in the PM mass of gasoline vehicle aerosol emissions due to SOA formation has significant implications for our understanding of the contribution of on-road vehicles to ambient aerosols and merits further study...|$|R
40|$|International @ AIR+BRM:ABO:MTS:NCA:LRE:BDA:PVEInternational audienceEpidemiological {{studies have}} linked {{exposure}} to particles matter less than 2. 5 microns in diameter (PM 2. 5) with adverse health (cardiovascular or pulmonary diseases {{that would cause}} premature death). The contribution of the transport sector to the total concentration of PM 2. 5 in the ambient air is 12 % [1]. This value represents an average which likely is higher in areas near emission sources (i. e. urban area). PM abatement in exhausts of gasoline direct injection (GDI) engines, which aims to improve fuel efficiency, will be necessary due to the strengthening of the European legislations. GDI engines offer a number of opportunities for improving fuel efficiency, such as reducing pumping losses, charge air cooling, and downsizing when turbocharged [2]. However, direct injection of fuel into the engine cylinder is susceptible to incomplete fuel evaporation and to fuel impingement on piston and cylinder walls, both of which lead to combusti on of liquid fuel and, consequently, to PM emissions increase [3]. <b>Gasoline</b> Particulate <b>Filters</b> (GPF) are currently developed to mechanically filter the soot particles emitted by GDI engines. The particle sizes in this case are typically smaller in comparison with diesel engines [4]. Ultrafine particulate (UFP) matter (1 - 40 nm) emissions from a GDI engine (1. 6 L) were characterized {{as a function of}} the engine operating regime in terms of particle numbers and size distributions. Exhaust gas samples were analyzed upstream and downstream a three-way converter (TWC), as well as downstream a GPF, i. e. at the exhaust outlet. UFPs were analyzed with a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer equipped with a dielectric barrier discharge, a differential mobility analyzer (176 channels) to classify the PM size range that enters into a Faraday-Cup Electrometer (FCE) to count the charged particulates (SMPS+E, Grimm). After a two stage dilution (realized by FPS 4000, DEKATI), the sampled aerosol was analyzed in the range 1 to 38 nm. SMPS+E data were compared with those of a SMPS (TSI, model 3080, PM size range 3 - 150 nm) and a DMS (Differential Mobility Spectrometer, Cambustion, PM size range analysis 5 - 1000 nm). In addition, the fraction of the elemental carbon in PM was estim ated with a Multi-Angle Absorption Photometer (MAAP, Thermo Scientific, model 5012). UFPs with diameters lower than 20 nm was detected upstream the TWC. UFPs total concentrations were high, in the range 2  20 1014 part/m 3 depending on the engine load. UFPs size distributions were found to be bimodal with mean diameters around 2 - 3 nm and 10 nm, respectively. The impact of TWC on UFP concentration and size was significant since a large part of UFPs, lower than 10 nm, was removed. Furthermore, the overall UFPs number was divided by one order of magnitude. The filtering efficiency for UFPs of the GPF was found to be high since no UFPs was detectable using the SMPS+E downstream the GPF (Fig. 1). These results will be discussed in relation with PM analysis in the range 5  200 nm, carbon elemental concentration as well as gas pollutant emissions.
