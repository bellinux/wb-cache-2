25|$|Expedition 21 crew members, Nicole Stott, Robert Thirsk and Frank De Winne {{completed}} the final steps {{of preparing for}} HTV's release from the ISS. These steps included disconnecting the final remaining power jumper line, closing the Node-2 nadir hatch, <b>depressurizing</b> the vestibule & performing leak checks, removing Common Berthing Mechanism bolts and deploying latches and unberthing the HTV-1 with the Space Station Remote Manipulator System.|$|E
25|$|The {{advantages}} of supercritical fluid extraction (compared with liquid extraction) {{are that it}} is relatively rapid because of the low viscosities and high diffusivities associated with supercritical fluids. The extraction can be selective to some extent by controlling {{the density of the}} medium, and the extracted material is easily recovered by simply <b>depressurizing,</b> allowing the supercritical fluid to return to gas phase and evaporate leaving little or no solvent residues. Carbon dioxide is the most common supercritical solvent. It is used on a large scale for the decaffeination of green coffee beans, the extraction of hops for beer production, and the production of essential oils and pharmaceutical products from plants. A few laboratory test methods include the use of supercritical fluid extraction as an extraction method instead of using traditional solvents.|$|E
2500|$|The {{extinguisher}} is {{emptied of}} its chemical and pressure {{to check for}} proper operation. All components are disassembled, inspected, cleaned, lubricated, or replaced if defective. Liquid agents are replaced at this time, dry agents may be re-used if in good condition, halon is recovered and re-used, but CO2 is discharged into the atmosphere. The extinguisher is then re-filled and recharged, after a [...] "verification of service" [...] collar is placed around the cylinder neck. It is impossible to properly install or remove a collar without <b>depressurizing</b> the extinguisher.|$|E

2500|$|Because the urea {{conversion}} is incomplete, {{the product}} must {{be separated from}} unchanged ammonium carbamate. In early [...] "straight-through" [...] urea plants this was done by letting down the system pressure to atmospheric to let the carbamate decompose back to ammonia and carbon dioxide. Originally, {{because it was not}} economic to recompress the ammonia and carbon dioxide for recycle, the ammonia at least would be used for the manufacture of other products, for example ammonium nitrate or sulfate. (The carbon dioxide was usually wasted.) Later process schemes made recycling unused ammonia and carbon dioxide practical. This was accomplished by <b>depressurizing</b> the reaction solution in stages (first to 18–25 bar and then to 2–5 bar) and passing it at each stage through a steam-heated carbamate decomposer, then recombining the resultant carbon dioxide and ammonia in a falling-film carbamate condenser and pumping the carbamate solution into the previous stage.|$|E
2500|$|A {{widely used}} method for heat {{sterilization}} is the [...] autoclave, sometimes called a converter or steam sterilizer. Autoclaves use steam heated to 121-134°C under pressure. To achieve sterility, {{the article is}} placed in a chamber and heated by injected steam until the article reaches a time and temperature setpoint. [...] Almost all the air {{is removed from the}} chamber, because air is undesired in the moist heat sterilization process (this is one trait that differ from a typical pressure cooker used for food cooking). The article is held at the temperature setpoint {{for a period of time}} which varies depending on what bioburden is present on the article being sterilized and its resistance (D-value) to steam sterilization. A general cycle would be anywhere between 3 and 15 minutes, (depending on the generated heat) at 121°C at 100 kPa, which is sufficient to provide a sterility assurance level of 10−4 for a product with a bioburden of 106 and a D-value of 2.0 minutes. Following sterilization, liquids in a pressurized autoclave must be cooled slowly to avoid boiling over when the pressure is released. This may be achieved by gradually <b>depressurizing</b> the sterilization chamber and allowing liquids to evaporate under a negative pressure, while cooling the contents.|$|E

50|$|A duct {{leakage test}} can be {{performed}} by either pressurizing or <b>depressurizing</b> the ductwork. Ductwork that is outside the building envelope, such as in an unconditioned attic or crawlspace, should be pressurized so as to not bring in unwanted contaminants such as dust.|$|E
50|$|The {{adiabatic}} {{processes are}} impermeable to heat: heat flows rapidly into the loop through the left expanding process resulting in increasing pressure while volume is increasing; {{some of it}} flows back out through the right <b>depressurizing</b> process; the heat that remains does the work.|$|E
50|$|Because {{most natural}} gas found in {{petroleum}} reservoirs {{is not a}} pure product, when non-associated gas is extracted from a field under supercritical pressure/temperature conditions (i.e., the pressure in the reservoir decreases below dewpoint), condensate liquids may form during the isothermic <b>depressurizing,</b> an effect called retrograde condensation.|$|E

40|$|Analyses were {{performed}} to determine maximum temperatures in the reactor pressure vessel for two potential Very-High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) designs during normal operation and during a <b>depressurized</b> conduction cooldown accident. The purpose of the analyses was {{to aid in the}} determination of appropriate reactor vessel materials for the VHTR. The designs evaluated utilized both prismatic and pebble-bed cores that generated 600 MW of thermal power. Calculations {{were performed}} for fluid outlet temperatures of 900 and 950 °C, corresponding to the expected range for the VHTR. The analyses were performed using the RELAP 5 - 3 D and PEBBED-THERMIX computer codes. Results of the calculations were compared with preliminary temperature limits derived from the ASME pressure vessel code. Because PEBBED-THERMIX has not been extensively validated, confirmatory calculations were also performed with RELAP 5 - 3 D for the pebble-bed design. During normal operation, the predicted axial profiles in reactor vessel temperature were similar with both codes and the predicted maximum values were within 2 °C. The trends of the calculated vessel temperatures were similar during the <b>depressurized</b> conduction cooldown accident. The maximum value predicted with RELAP 5 - 3 D during the <b>depressurized</b> conduction cooldown accident was about 40 °C higher than that predicted with PEBBED. This agreement is considered reasonable based on the expected uncertainty in either calculation. The differences between the PEBBED and RELAP 5 - 3 D calculations were not large enough to affect conclusions concerning comparisons between calculated and allowed maximum temperatures during normal operation and the <b>depressurized</b> conduction cooldown accident...|$|R

50|$|The first picture shows a U.S. Navy Airman {{performing}} a manual calibration procedure on a pressure test gauge. The procedure is complex, but overall {{it involves the}} following: (i) <b>depressurizing</b> the system, and turning the screw, if necessary, {{to ensure that the}} needle reads zero, (ii) fully pressurizing the system and ensuring that the needle reads maximum, within acceptable tolerances, (iii) replacing the gauge if the error in the calibration process is beyond tolerance, as this may indicate signs of failure such as corrosion or material fatigue.|$|E
50|$|Lead fusible plugs may {{be present}} in the crown of the boiler's firebox. If the water level drops, such that the {{temperature}} of the firebox crown increases significantly, the lead melts and the steam escapes, warning the operators, who may then manually suppress the fire. Except in the smallest of boilers the steam escape has little effect on dampening the fire. The plugs are also too small in area to lower steam pressure significantly, <b>depressurizing</b> the boiler. If they were any larger, the volume of escaping steam would itself endanger the crew.|$|E
