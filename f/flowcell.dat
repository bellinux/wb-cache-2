For studying the features of DNA-protein interactions involved in DNA-repair, on the single-molecule level, the combination of microfluidics, surface preparations and fluorescence microscopy {{is used by the}} single molecule biophysics group at the physics department at the University of Gothenburg. In addition, traditional biochemical techniques, Polymerase Chain Reaction and agarose-gel electrophoresis, are also used to produce and analyze various types of DNA used in the single molecule experiments. The work is interdisciplinary and combines physics, surface science, biochemistry and micro/nano science, which motivated me to finish my master thesis project in the field of single molecule biophysics. In order to investigate the repair of the double-stranded break (DSB), we tried to simulate the homologous recombination (HR) process in vitro to study the interaction between DNA and the protein Rad 51 through single molecule experiments. The objective of this thesis project was to prepare DNA structures to mimic the damaged DNA with processed DSBs. The damaged and processed DNA structures are double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) with a 3 ’-single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) overhang of various lengths. These DNA structures will work as the substrates {{for the study of the}} DNA-protein interaction that are involved in the repair of DSBs. Short pieces of ssDNA (140 nt) were designed and bought directly. Long pieces of ssDNA (5 kb) were produced via Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) followed by lambda-exonuclease treatment using lambda-phage DNA (48 kbp) as template. The optimal conditions were acquired after repeated experiments and the results were verified by agarose gel electrophoresis. Finally, these ssDNA molecules were ligated to the original lambda-DNA. Fluorescently labeled Replication Protein A (RPA) that preferentially binds ssDNA, was used to confirm that the DNA samples contained the desired structure, dsDNA with 3 ’-ssDNA overhang.

Combining X-ray techniques with microfluidics is an experimental strategy that {{reduces the risk of}} x-ray induced beam damage and also allows time-resolved studies of processes taking place in <b>flowcells.</b> The experimental results and theoretical predictions presented here, show that in the low shear limit, for a ``transverse flow'' scattering geometry (scattering wave vector q perpendicular to the direction of flow) the measured relaxation times are independent of the flow rate and determined only by the diffusive motion of the particles. This is not generally valid and in particular, for a ``longitudinal flow'' (q || flow) scattering geometry, the relaxation times are strongly affected by the flow-induced motion of the particles. Our results show that the Brownian diffusion of colloidal particles can be measured in a flowing sample and that, up to flux limitations, the experimental conditions under which this is possible are easier to achieve at higher values of q.

Load balancing schemes based on flow hash-ing, e. g., ECMP, cause congestion when hash collisions oc-cur and can perform poorly in asymmetric topologies. Re-cent proposals to load balance the network require central-ized traffic engineering, multipath-aware transport, or ex-pensive specialized hardware. We propose a mechanism that avoids these limitations by (i) pushing load-balancing func-tionality into the soft network edge (e. g., virtual switches) such that no changes are required in the transport layer, cus-tomer VMs, or networking hardware, and (ii) load balanc-ing on fine-grained, near-uniform units of data (<b>flowcells)</b> that fit within end-host segment offload optimizations used to support fast networking speeds.

The use of electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) <b>flowcells</b> allowed simultaneous and continuous in situ monitoring of biofilm formation and resulting open circuit potential U-R. Combination of macroscopic and microscopic measurements Of U-R versus t with confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) offered high resolution, destruction free {{characterization of the}} electrochemical influences of growing biofilms and their subsequent changes during disinfection and cleaning processes. Cyclovoltammograms (CVs) on macroscopic Pt electrodes after biofilm colonization proved a strong inhibition of H-adsorption and oxide growth while O- 2 -reduction was catalyzed. Repeated cycling reduced the biofilm effects until platinum behavior, except for the H-adsorption, could be observed again. Influences of biofilm thickness and age played an inferior role in these effects. Calculation of net charges showed a restriction of electrochemical detection to a sub-pin layer on the electrode surface. Microelectrode array measurements yielded no direct correlation between the localization of colonies and local shift of open circuit potential U-R for several film proportions. Disinfection with 70 % EtOH killed the organisms, but left U-R unchanged. Cleaning with 10 % H 2 O 2 removed all biomass, resulting in clean microelectrode surfaces and restoration of U-R values to those of pure metal. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Biofilms {{are major}} sites of carbon cycling in streams. Therefore, {{it is crucial}} to improve {{knowledge}} about biofilms’ structure and microbial composition to understand their contribution in the self-purification of surface water. The present work intends to study biofilm formation in the presence of humic substances (HSs) as a carbon source. Two biofilm <b>flowcells</b> were operated in parallel; one with synthetic stream water, displaying a background carbon concentration of 1. 26 ± 0. 84 mg L− 1, the other with added HSs and an overall carbon concentration of 9. 68 ± 1. 00 mg L− 1. From the biofilms’ results of culturable and total countable cells, it can be concluded that the presence of HSs did not significantly enhance the biofilm cell density. However, the biofilm formed in the presence of HSs presented slightly higher values of volatile suspended solids (VSS) and protein. One possible explanation for this result is that HSs adsorbed to the polymeric matrix of the biofilm and were included in the quantification of VSS and protein. The microbial composition of the biofilm with addition of HSs was characterized by the presence of bacteria belonging to beta-Proteobacteria, Cupriavidus metallidurans and several species of the genus Ralstonia were identified, and gamma-Proteobacteria, represented by Escherichia coli. In the biofilm formed without HSs addition beta-Proteobacteria, represented by the species Variovorax paradoxus, and bacteria belonging to the group Bacteroidetes were detected. In conclusion, the presence of HSs did not significantly enhance biofilm cell density but influenced the bacterial diversity in the biofilm.

These characteristics were investigated in three coaggregating early colonizers of the tooth surface (Streptococcus gordonii DL 1, Streptococcus oralis 34, and Actinomyces naeslundii T 14 V). Area coverage and cell cluster size measurements showed that attachment of A. naeslundii and of S. gordonii to glass <b>flowcells</b> was enhanced by a salivary conditioning film, whereas attachment of S. oralis was hindered. Growth experiments using saliva as the sole carbon and nitrogen source showed that A. naeslundii was unable to grow either in planktonic culture or as a biofilm, whereas S. gordonii grew under both conditions. S. oralis grew planktonically, but to a much lower maximum cell density than did S. gordonii; S. oralis did not grow reproducibly as a biofilm. Thus, only S. gordonii possessed all traits advantageous for growth as a solitary and independent resident of the tooth. Two-species biofilm experiments analyzed by laser confocal microscopy showed that neither S. oralis nor A. naeslundii grew when coaggregated pairwise with S. gordonii. However, both S. oralis and A. naeslundii showed luxuriant, interdigitated growth when paired together in coaggregated microcolonies. Thus, the S. oralis-A. naeslundii pair formed a mutualistic relationship, potentially contact dependent, that allows each to grow where neither could survive alone. S. gordonii, in contrast, neither was hindered by nor benefited from the presence of either of the other strains.

40|$|Abstract Background Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) is a {{major cause}} of human {{gastroenteritis}} worldwide. The outer membrane proteins expressed by S. Typhimurium mediate the process of adhesion and internalisation within the intestinal epithelium of the host thus influencing the progression of disease. Since the outer membrane proteins are surface-exposed, they provide attractive targets for the development of improved antimicrobial agents and vaccines. Various techniques have been developed for their characterisation, but issues such as carryover of cytosolic proteins still remain a problem. In this study we attempted to characterise the surface proteome of S. Typhimurium using Lipid-based Protein Immobilisation technology in the form of LPI™ <b>FlowCells.</b> No detergents are required and no sample clean up is needed prior to downstream analysis. The immobilised proteins can be digested with proteases in multiple steps to increase sequence coverage, and the peptides eluted can be characterised directly by liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and identified from mass spectral database searches. Results In this study, 54 outer membrane proteins, were identified with two or more peptide hits using a multi-step digest approach. Out of these 28 were lipoproteins, nine were involved in transport and three with enzyme activity These included the transporters BtuB which is responsible for the uptake of vitamin B 12, LamB which is involved in the uptake of maltose and maltodextrins and LolB which is involved in the incorporation of lipoproteins in the outer membrane. Other proteins identified included the enzymes MltC which {{may play a role in}} cell elongation and division and NlpD which is involved in catabolic processes in cell wall formation as well as proteins involved in virulence such as Lpp 1, Lpp 2 and OmpX. Conclusion Using a multi-step digest approach the LPI™ technique enables the incorporation of a multi-step protease work flow ensuring enough sequence coverage of membrane proteins subsequently leading to the identification of more membrane proteins with higher confidence. Compared to current sub-cellular fractionation procedures and previous published work, the LPI™ technique currently provides the widest coverage of outer membrane proteins identified as demonstrated here for Salmonella Typhimurium. </p...|$|R

The modified method offers the following new features: 1) prevents animals from settling and clogging with constant bubbling in the sample container; 2) prevents damage to sample animals and facilitates recycling by replacing the built-in peristaltic pump with an external syringe pump, in order to generate negative pressure, creates a steady flow by drawing air from the receiving conical flask (i. e. vacuum pump), and transfers plankton from the sample container toward the main <b>flowcell</b> of the imaging system and finally into the receiving flask; 3) aligns samples in advance of imaging and prevents clogging with an additional <b>flowcell</b> placed ahead of the main <b>flowcell.</b> These modifications were designed to overcome the difficulties applying the standard FlowCAM procedure to studies where {{the number of individuals}} per sample is small, and since the FlowCAM can only image a subset of a sample.

40|$|Background Zooxanthellate scleractinian corals are sessile colonial {{animals that}} live in {{symbiosis}} with photosynthetic algae, the zooxanthellae. They can feed both phototrophically and heterotrophically and produce an external skeleton of calcium carbonate, which process is enhanced by light. They are the key organisms of tropical coral reefs and responsible for building the large carbonate structures. Tropical coral reefs are increasingly threatened by both natural and anthropogenic stresses. Concurrently with the gradual decline of coral reefs, a growing interest in keeping this delicate ecosystem in aquaria has emerged. To reduce harvest from the wild, increasing effort is put in developing cost-effective coral aquaculture culture. The objective of this thesis was to study the influence of light (irradiance and photoperiod) and flow on coral growth and physiology. Furthermore, the interaction between light and water flow was studied. Methods The effect of flow (Chapter 2), light (Chapter 3), photoperiod (Chapter 4) and the interaction between light and flow (Chapter 5) on coral growth were studied in long-term experiments monitoring several growth parameters such as buoyant weight (i. e. skeletal mass), surface area and polyp number. Physiological parameters such as photosynthesis and respiration were measured in respirometric <b>flowcells</b> to provide {{an explanation for the}} observed differences in growth. Moreover, an overview was given of different factors controlling coral growth and how such knowledge can be translated to aquaculture practice (Chapter 6). Results In the absence of water flow, coral growth was significantly lower and corals appeared unhealthy. In the presence of water flow (10, 20 and 25 cm s- 1, at 90 µE m- 2 s- 1), growth rates were significantly increased. However, growth was not significantly different between 10 cm s- 1 and 20 cm s- 1, but again significantly increased at 25 cm s- 1. Differences in growth could not be explained by net photosynthetic rate and Scope for Growth based on phototrophic carbon, since these parameters decreased with increasing water flow (Chapter 2). Increasing irradiance significantly increased the specific exponential growth rate of Galaxea fascicularis. The relation between skeletal growth and net photosynthesis was not directly proportional, but distorted at high irradiance levels (Chapter 3). Increasing photoperiod did not increase the specific exponential growth rate of Galaxea fascicularis. However, since growth neither increased with increasing irradiance, it is suggested that growth was limited by another factor and light was therefore saturating. The corals in the 24 hour light treatment were not able to adapt to prolonged light duration. However, the corals in the 16 hour light treatment probably photo-acclimated to prolonged photoperiod under light-saturating conditions by reducing their hourly photosynthetic rates (16 hour vs. 8 hour light) As a result, daily net photosynthetic was not significantly different, just as their growth rates (Chapter 4). The interaction between light and water flow for coral growth was significant. Water flow stimulated coral growth more at 600 µE m- 2 s- 1 than at 300 µE m- 2 s- 1 and the highest growth rates were attained at high irradiance (600 µE m- 2 s- 1) in combination with high flow rates (15 - 25 cm s- 1). Nevertheless, enhancement of coral growth with either increasing irradiance or increasing water flow could not be explained by net photosynthetic rates (Chapter 5). There are many factors (both environmental and genetical) that can potentially limit or inhibit coral growth. Optimization of coral aquaculture therefore requires close fine-tuning of factors. Growth models {{can be used as a}} tool to determine the best culture strategy (Chapter 6). Conclusion Increasing water flow has a positive effect on coral growth at a wide range of irradiance levels (90, 300 and 600 µE/m 2 /s). Increasing irradiance also has a positive effect on coral growth. However, the positive relation between irradiance and coral growth is disturbed when other factors are limiting. Corals were able to retain their growth rates upon photoperiod extension under light-saturating conditions, presumably by means of reducing their hourly photosynthetic rate. At high irradiance levels, the enhancement of coral growth was not proportionally related to net photosynthesis, suggesting that other factors become limiting. Since the interaction between irradiance and water flow is significant, this indicates that water flow can remove some of those limitations at high irradiance levels. The mechanism of enhancement did not seem related to differences in net photosynthetic rate, but is possibly related to reduced energy allocation toward costly photo-protective mechanisms at high irradiance and high flow. The information in this thesis should not be used as a blueprint for coral aquaculture, however, its value lies in providing a blueprint for targeted optimization studies of coral aquaculture. Since the magnitude of effect of one factor often depends on the other, it is of importance for the future to perform multi-factorial experiments to provide insight in the interactions between factors. Under light-saturating conditions, further increases in irradiance or extension of photoperiod do not result in more growth. [Increasing irradiance has a positive relation with both coral growth and net photosynthesis.

[Increasing water flow has a positive effect on coral growth at a wide range of irradiance levels (90, 300 and 600 µE/m 2 /s). In our studies, differences in growth could not be explained with differences in net photosynthetic rate. Rather differences in growth could be related to algal competition and sedimentation or other physiological parameters such as (in) organic nutrient uptake, relief of photo-oxidative stress and dark respiration that are influenced by water flow. Increasing irradiance also has a positive effect on coral growth. Enhancement of coral growth by light was not proportionally related to net photosynthesis at higher irradiance levels, suggesting that other factors become limiting. The significant interaction between light and water flow indicates that water flow can remove some limitations and that the presence of water flow is very important for optimal light use for coral growth. The mechanism did not seem related to differences in net photosynthetic rate, but is possibly related to reduced energy allocation toward costly photo-protective mechanisms at high irradiance and high flow. The effect of increasing photoperiod under light-limiting conditions still needs to be established. Since enhancement of coral growth did not seem to be d… by photosynthesis at higher irradiance levels [WEL, maar niet proportional], it suggested limited [...] One of such factors that can remove limitations is water flow. A significant interaction between light and water flow is detected, … but this effect is dependent on water flow. The interaction between light and water flow indicates that water flow is very important for optimal light use for coral growth. The mechanism is still unclear, but is possibly related to reduced energy allocation toward costly photo-protective mechanisms at high irradiance and high flow. Both increasing irradiance and water flow have a positive effect on coral growth, and a significant interaction is found between light and water flow. The positive effect of increasing water flow on coral growth was found to be significant both at an irradiance of 90 µE/m 2 /s (Chapter 2), 300 µE/m 2 /s and 600 µE/m 2 /s (Chapter 5). Neither of these differences in growth were supported by a significant increase in net photosynthetic rate, in contrast to our expectations. The positive effect of increasing water flow on coral growth is probably a consequence of both external (algal competition and sedimentation) and internal mechanisms((in) organic nutrient uptake, relief of photo-oxidative stress, respiration). Different at different irradiance levels. External at 90, internal at 300 and 600 The positive effect of irradiance on skeletal growth was demonstrated in both Chapter 3 and 5. The relationship with photosynthesis irradiance curve not proportional. - mediation by P not clear. - The relation between skeletal growth and net photosynthesis was not proportional, In contrast, no positive effect of irradiance on skeletal growth was found in Chapter 4. Both specific growth rate and net photosynthesis increased with irradiance, however, this relationship was not proportional. It is suggested that. at high irradiance levels, skeletal growth (i. e. calcification and organic matrix synthesis) is not limited by light or photosynthesis.

40|$|Characterizing {{two-phase}} flow in porous media {{is important to}} provide estimates of sweep efficiency in enhanced oil recovery and storage estimates in potential geological CO 2 sequestration repositories. To further the current understanding of {{two-phase flow}} in porous media a micro-model of interconnected channels was designed and fabricated using stereolithography to experimentally study gas-liquid flows. This <b>flowcell</b> was created with a wide variability of throat dimensions to represent naturally occurring porous media. Low flow rate experiments of immiscible two-phase drainage were performed within this cell. Additionally, a computational model for analyzing two-phase flows in the same <b>flowcell</b> was developed and used to simulate conditions not possible with our laboratory settings. The computational model was first tested for the identical conditions used in the experimental studies, and was shown {{to be in good}} agreement with the experimentally determined fractal dimension of the invading gas structure, time until breakthrough, and fluid saturation. The numerical model was then used to study two-phase air-water flows in flowcells with the same geometry and different gas-liquid-solid contact angles. The percent saturation of air and the motion of the fluids through the cell were found to vary with changes in these parameters. Finally, to simulate flows expected during geologic carbon sequestration, the fluid properties and interface conditions were set to model the flow of CO 2 into a brine-saturated porous medium at representative subsurface conditions. The CO 2 flows were shown to have larger gas saturations than the previous air into water studies. Thus the accuracy of the computational model was supported by the <b>flowcell</b> experiments, and the computational model extended the laboratory results to conditions not possible with the apparatus used in the experiments...|$|E

In both tests, 40 -μL sample aliquots of 2.0  mg N L− 1 standard were used. For the two-zone stack, a 10 -μL reagent zone was aspirated followed by a 40 -μL sample zone. For the three-zone sandwiching, the 40 -μL sample zone was sequentially piled in between two 10 -μL reagent lines in the holding coil. Reagent volume was varied in search of the optimum using 40 μL of 2.0  mg N L− 1 standard. The volumes investigated were 3, 5, 7, 10, and 15  μL of the single reagent. Optimization of volume dispensed to the <b>flowcell</b> (delay position) for the stopflow mode of reagent/sample-combined zones was performed. For this test, 40  μL of 2.0  mg N L− 1 standard and 10  μL reagent were sequentially aspirated.

40|$|Abstract Background Allele-specific {{expression}} (ASE) assays {{can be used}} {{to identify}} cis, trans, and cis -by- trans regulatory variation. Understanding the source of expression variation has important implications for disease susceptibility, phenotypic diversity, and adaptation. While ASE is commonly measured via relative fluorescence at a SNP, next generation sequencing provides an opportunity to measure ASE in an accurate and high-throughput manner using read counts. Results We introduce a Solexa-based method to perform large numbers of ASE assays using only a single lane of a Solexa <b>flowcell.</b> In brief, transcripts of interest, which contain a known SNP, are PCR enriched and barcoded to enable multiplexing. Then high-throughput sequencing is used to estimate allele-specific expression using sequencing counts. To validate this method, we measured the allelic bias in a dilution series and found high correlations between measured and expected values (r> 0. 9, p Drosophila simulans parental mix, F 1 and introgression and found that for these genes the majority of expression divergence can be explained by cis -regulatory variation. Conclusion We present a new method with the capacity to measure ASE for large numbers of assays using as little as one lane of a Solexa <b>flowcell.</b> This will be a valuable technique for molecular and population genetic studies, as well as for verification of genome-wide data sets. </p...|$|E
40|$|The stress-optical rule relates {{birefringence}} to stress. Consequently, {{measurement of}} flow birefringence provides a non-intrusive technique of measuring stresses in complex flows. In this investigation we explore {{the use of}} an axisymmetric geometry to create a uniaxial elongational flow in polymer melts. In axisymmetric flows both birefringence and orientation angle change continuously along the path of the propagating light. Because polarimetry measurements provide the cumulative influence of the material's optical properties along the light's integrated path, this makes determination of local birefringence in the melt impossible. One can nevertheless use experimentally determined birefringence measurements to compare with predictions from computer simulations as a means of evaluating the ma! terials' governing constitutive stress equations. More specifically, in this investigation we compare the light intensity transmitted through the experimental set-up versus entry position, with the theoretically calculated transmitted intensity distribution as a means of comparing experiment and simulation. The main complication in our experiments is the use of a <b>flowcell</b> that necessarily consists of materials of different refractive indices. This introduces refraction and reflection effects that must be modelled before experimental results can be correctly interpreted. We describe how these effects are taken into account and test the accuracy of predictions against experiments. In addition, the high temperatures required to investigate polymer melts, mean that a further complication is introduced by thermal stresses present in the <b>flowcell</b> glass. We describe how these thermal-stresses are also incorporated ! nin the simulations. Finally, we present a few preliminary results and evaluate the success of the overall method...|$|E

40|$|Pharmacokinetic {{studies in}} young {{children}} require very sensitive methods using low plasma volumes. Although vincristine {{has been used as}} an antineoplastic drug for almost 40 years, data on vincristine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are scarce, especially {{in young children}}. One of the reasons for this is the lack of a specific and sensitive assay suitable for small plasma volumes. Therefore the authors aimed to improve an existing high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay by changing the solid-phase extraction material and by using a more sensitive and controlled electrochemical detector. An on-line solid-phase extraction was used with a preconcentration column of 10. 3 min ID containing octadecyl silane (ODS) reversed-phase material and an analytical microsphere C 18 column. The mobile phase was unchanged and consisted of 35 % phosphate buffer 0. 02 mol (pH 7. 00 +/- 0. 10), 50 % methanol, and 15 % acetonitrile. Detection was performed with a new electrochemical detector. This detector comprised a highly stable Faraday-shielded oven compartment that accommodated a column and <b>flowcell.</b> The <b>flowcell</b> had a spacer thickness of 0. 25 mum set at 830 mV. It also had an excellent signal-to-noise ratio, which resulted in very sensitive electrochemical analysis. These improvements resulted in a lower required sample volume of only 0. 3 mL instead of 1. 2 mL plasma with a very low Emit of quantitation of 0. 483 mug/L according to good laboratory practice (GLP) rules. The intraday coefficients of variation were 6. 2 % (0. 483 mug/L) and 4. 2 % (18. 4 mug/L). The interday coefficients of variation were 10. 3 % (0. 483 mug/L) and 8. 5 % (18. 4 mug/L) ...|$|E

40|$|Sequencing microRNA, reduced {{representation}} sequencing, Hi-C {{technology and}} any method requiring {{the use of}} in-house barcodes result in sequencing libraries with low initial sequence diversity. Sequencing such data on the Illumina platform typically produces low quality data due to {{the limitations of the}} Illumina cluster calling algorithm. Moreover, even in the case of diverse samples, these limitations are causing substantial inaccuracies in multiplexed sample assignment (sample bleeding). Such inaccuracies are unacceptable in clinical applications, and in some other fields (e. g. detection of rare variants). Here, we discuss how both problems with quality of low-diversity samples and sample bleeding are caused by incorrect detection of clusters on the <b>flowcell</b> during initial sequencing cycles. We propose simple software modifications (Long Template Protocol) that overcome this problem. We present experimental results showing that our Long Template Protocol remarkably increases data quality for low diversity samples, as compared with the standard analysis protocol; it also substantially reduces sample bleeding for all samples. For comprehensiveness, we also discuss and compare experimental results from alternative approaches to sequencing low diversity samples. First, we discuss how the low diversity problem, if caused by barcodes, can be avoided altogether at the barcode design stage. Second and third, we present modified guidelines, which are more stringent than the manufacturer's, for mixing low diversity samples with diverse samples and lowering cluster density, which in our experience consistently produces high quality data from low diversity samples. Fourth and fifth, we present rescue strategies that can be applied when sequencing results in low quality data and when there is no more biological material available. In such cases, we propose that the <b>flowcell</b> be re-hybridized and sequenced again using our Long Template Protocol. Alternatively, we discuss how analysis can be repeated from saved sequencing images using the Long Template Protocol to increase accuracy...|$|E
