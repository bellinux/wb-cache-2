2500|$|Vijay Laxman Manjrekar [...] (26 September 1931 in Bombay – 18 October 1983 in Madras) is {{a former}} Indian cricketer who played 55 Tests. A small man, he was a <b>fine</b> <b>cutter</b> and hooker of the ball. [...] He {{was the father of}} Sanjay Manjrekar.|$|E
5000|$|Born in Baildon, Yorkshire, England, and nicknamed [...] "Ticker" [...] {{because of}} a habit of chatting to himself while batting, Mitchell was a solid, {{determined}} and sometimes dour middle order batsman who converted to become an opening batsman after the retirement of Percy Holmes in 1932. An accumulator of runs rather than a stroke maker, he very occasionally allowed himself to bat more freely, {{and when he did}} he revealed himself as a particularly <b>fine</b> <b>cutter.</b> He scored centuries in four consecutive innings for Yorkshire in 1933.|$|E
50|$|He scored 18849 runs in {{first-class}} cricket at {{an average}} of 30.45, including 27 centuries. In his 434 matches for Surrey his highest innings was 205 not out against Somerset at The Oval in 1952. The double century was particularly memorable as it took only 5 hours. Small in stature, Constable was a <b>fine</b> <b>cutter</b> of the ball. He batted up and down the order as the needs of the team demanded. He was a useful leg spinner early in his career becoming an occasional change later on.|$|E

50|$|J.S. O'Connor American Rich Cut Glassware Factory, {{also known}} as Maple City Glass Company, H.W. Kimble Silk Company, and Arrow Throwing Company, is a {{historic}} glassware factory and silk mill located at Hawley, Wayne County, Pennsylvania. With the waning of the canal and gravity rail operations in the late 19th Century, Hawley developed into a busy manufacturing town. In addition to silk fabric and garments, among the chief products was fine cut glass. The leading cut glass establishment was that of John Sarsfield O’Connor (1831 - 1916) {{at the base of}} the Paupack Falls. The building was built on the site of previous mills of wood frame construction in 1890. The earliest of these dates back to the founding of the hamlet of Paupack Eddy, the forerunner of Hawley, in the closing decade of the 18th Century. It is a three-story, 160 feet long and 44 feet wide, bluestone building in the Federal style, with an addition 40 by 75 feet. J.S. O’Connor Rich Cut Glass has been described as one of the most extensive glass cutting factories in America. O’Connor is recalled as one of the <b>finest</b> glass <b>cutters</b> in the nation.The factory was said to be one of its kind in America, run by water power and lit by electricity generated by its own electrical plant. The firm had a capacity of 250 cutting frames. When the third floor was rebuilt, 50 cutting frames were added.This brought the workforce from 150 to nearly 200, and a new showroom was built. Another reference says that the workforce eventually reached almost 300. In 1902, the cut glass firm relocated from Hawley to Goshen, Orange County, NY. On January 16th of that year, J. S. O’Connor sold his Hawley plant. The addition was built in 1926, when the building was converted to a silk throwing mill. In 1941 Daniel Vacca Sr, purchased the silk mill. Vacca & Sons operated the Arrow Throwing Company at the facility. During World War II, the Vaccas were a major supplier of yarn for emblems and insignias as well as nylon cord for parachutes. Arrow Throwing Company, the last remaining silk mill in Hawley and one of the few throwing mills left in the Northeast, closed its doors in 1987. Soon a lobby was added to the building by new owners in 1988, when converted to an inn, and a restaurant was added years later. It has a shed roof and features pedimented windows and a decorative cornice.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} work, {{to improve the}} press {{formability}} of {{the combination of the}} TRIP steel and ferrite-martensite dual-phase (DP) steel, the mechanical properties and press formability (stretch-formability) of YAG laser welded TRIP/DP tailored blanks were investigated. An as-cold-rolled sheet steel with the chemical composition of (0. 1 – 0. 3) C– 1. 5 Si– 1. 5 Mn (mass%) was used in this study. For comparison, 0. 14 C– 0. 22 Si– 1. 78 Mn (mass%) DP steel was also prepared. The quenched DP steel is called MDP 0, and the tempered MDP 0 steel is called MDP 4. For butt welding, the blank obtained after the heat treatment was cut using a <b>fine</b> <b>cutter,</b> and YAG laser processing equipment was used. The press formability was evaluated from the maximum stretch-height (Hmax). Tensile tests and stretch forming tests have been conducted for laser butt welded joints obtained from the combination of the different steel. The Hmax value of the MDP 0 steel was not controlled at the strength level of the DP steel, and was not different from the Hmax value of the MDP 4 steel. It is thought that this was assisted to TRIP of the TDP steel because the tensile strength of the TDP steel is consequentially lower than that of the MDP 0 steel. High ductility and the high stretch-formability were able to be secured by the high strength TRIP/DP tailored blanks. 1...|$|E
