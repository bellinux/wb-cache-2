50|$|On 15 October 1909, the railcar ran {{under its}} own power for the first time, {{carrying}} 32 people around the factory. The vehicle was 40 ft (12.2m) long and 10 ft (3m) wide, and with a 20 hp (15 kW) petrol engine, had a speed of 22 mph (35 km/h). The transmission was electric, with the petrol engine driving a generator, and electric motors located on both bogies. This generator also supplied power to the <b>gyro</b> <b>motors</b> and the air compressor. The balancing system used a pneumatic servo, rather than the friction wheels used in the earlier model.|$|R

When the <b>Gyro</b> <b>Motor</b> Company opened, Spencer Heath (1876-1963), a mechanical engineer (among other things), became the manager. Heath was connected with the American Propeller Company, also a manufacturer of aeronautical related mechanisms and products in Baltimore, Maryland. Both R.S.

50|$|In fact between 1907 and 1926, Berliner {{dedicated}} {{himself to}} improving the technologies of vertical flight {{through the development of}} a light-weight rotary engine, which he improved upon throughout the 1910s and 1920s. With R.S. Moore, also a Scientist and Inventor, as his chief assistant, Berliner obtained automobile engines from the Adams Company in Dubuque Iowa, manufacturer of the Adams-Farwell automobile. This car used air cooled three or five cylinder rotary engines which were developed in-house by Fay Oliver Farwell (1859-1935). Berliner and Farwell adapted them for use in perfecting “machines” produced for vertical flight. His realizations allowed him {{to move away from the}} heavy in-line engines to lighter rotary models, which led to the invention of a 6-hp rotary engine for the improvement of vertical flight. It was these experiments that led to the formal creation of the <b>Gyro</b> <b>Motor</b> Company in 1909. And it was the creation the 6-hp rotary engine that initiated the use of rotary engines in aviation. The <b>Gyro</b> <b>Motor</b> Company manufactured these and other improved versions of the Gyro Engine between 1909 and roughly 1926. The building used for these operations exists at 774 Girard Street, NW, Washington DC, where its principal facade is in the Fairmont-Girard alleyway.|$|E
5000|$|In December 1912, Berliner {{traveled}} to Germany {{and set up}} a German manufacturing component in Adlershof to market the Gyro engines with a $500,000 capitalization. In London, pilot Beatty demonstrated a Wright aircraft retrofitted with a 50 hp Gyro engine. The Gyro progressed to 80 hp in the seven cylinder model by 1913, and up to 110 hp in the Model L nine cylinder [...] "Duplex" [...] with a uniqure cam driven exhaust valve. The French Gnome Omega and future variants proved to be more popular in sales. Motorenfabrik Oberursel developed its own rotary from the Gnome Monosoupape that would power many World War I fighters. In June 1914, Berliner's nephew, Joseph Sanders became the general manager. He purchased the assets in May 1917, forming the Gyro Company. <b>Gyro</b> <b>motor</b> production did not continue past World War I, when a flood of advanced designs were introduced to the market.|$|E

5000|$|The {{mechanical}} analogue bombsight {{computer was}} employed in World War Two bomber aircraft {{to determine the}} exact moment bombs were to be released to hit their target. The bombardier entered information on air and wind speed, wind direction, altitude, angle of drift and bomb weight into the computer which then calculated the bomb release point, using a complex arrangement of <b>gyros,</b> <b>motors,</b> gears and a telescope. (Jacobs 1996) It {{was in the early}} 1950s that Henry purchased his very first Sperry bombsight computer, in mint condition, from an army surplus warehouse in Shude Hill, Manchester. This purchase was inspired by Henry's lifelong passion for all things mechanical, which had been further fuelled by seven years serving as a technical clerk with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers during World War Two. (O'Hanrahan 2005) Henry so marvelled at the mechanical inner workings of this bombsight computer in motion, that he eventually decided to capture its [...] "peerless parabolas" [...] (as Henry termed its inner workings), on paper. He then modified the bombsight to create the first drawing machine of 1960. A second was constructed in 1963 and a third in 1967. (O'Hanrahan 2005) These machines created complex, abstract, asymmetrical, curvilinear, repetitive line drawings which were either left untouched as completed drawings or embellished by the artist's hand in response to the suggestive machine-generated effects. None of Henry's machines now remains in operational order. (O'Hanrahan 2005) ...|$|R

The leveling of the platform is {{taken over by the}} X and Y accelerometers sensing even the smallest component of gravity which is an indication of not being precisely level. The leveling of the stable element is achieved by torqueing the respective gyro torquers which makes the gimbal motors to follow up and level the stable element. The distance shafts are set to zero; the gyros are at operational speed and the computer is continuously feeding the gyros, and thereby the stable element, with corrections for local earth rotation. This is called the leveling phase of fine align.|$|R
50|$|Atlas D {{tests on}} the West Coast hit a series of snags in the {{following}} months as well. Atlas 25D had flown successfully on April 22 from 576B-1, a coffin silo. The next attempt, 23D (May 6) began experiencing abnormal pitch gyrations within 10 seconds of launch. After about 20 seconds, the missile started tumbling out of control upon which the RSO sent the destruct command. This failure was attributed to wiring in the pitch gyro contacting the casing and shorting out the <b>gyro</b> <b>motor.</b> Atlas 74D (July 22) broke up 70 seconds into launch due to {{a failure of the}} pitch gyro either due to an improper motor speed setting or torquing signals. Missile 47D (September 12) lost sustainer thrust due to a leak in the vernier helium supply system. Missile 33D (September 29) failed to stage its booster section when the staging electrical disconnect plug pulled out at T+125 seconds. 81D (October 13) failed when the LOX quick disconnect pressure sensor malfunctioned due to the loss of a heat shield at liftoff, causing the pneumatic system to overpressurize the LOX tank with helium until it ruptured the intermediate bulkhead and destroyed the missile at T+72 seconds.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Gyro</b> <b>motor</b> {{company was}} formed in 1909 by Emile Berliner to pursue {{production}} of rotary engines. His designs were improvements of the Addams-Farwell rotary engine Berliner used in early helicopter experiments. The engines {{at the time of}} his 1901 experiments were 20 lbs per hp. Addams-Farwell built a custom engine that weighed 3-4 lb per hp. Berliner donated the engine to the National Air and Space Museum, and pursued his own advanced version. He built a small factory on 744 Girard Street in Washington D.C. next to another small factory for his Victor record players.Gyro incorporated with $100,000 in stock in 1911 and manufactured three varieties of the rotary engine. A Three, Five and Seven cylinder model each with the same bore and stroke. His engines featured a 40 lb cast nickel-steel cylinder assembly that was machined down to just 6 1/2 pounds with spiraling cooling fins adding strength. Emile experimented with graphite powder suspended in the fuel as a method of light-weight lubrication. A monoplane built by the Washington Aeroplane Company set an American endurance record with a Gyro Seven cylinder engine of 4 hours and 23 minutes in the air.|$|E

The problem is to transfer the supply voltage to the platform and the electric signals to and from the platform. Design solutions concerning the power supply and information transfer are supported by the experimental techniques suggested in this paper, namely: the use of the rolling contact; three-phase <b>gyro</b> <b>motor</b> power supply replaced by that from the single-phase network; signal transmission from the precession angle sensor using the air transformer; current and voltage frequency division; DC mode selection for the torquer. The results obtained prove the efficiency of the suggested design solutions...|$|E

30|$|In terrain {{perception}} field, researchers choose {{in general}} two directions, namely, predictive and reactive terrain perceptions. Predictive terrain perception {{is done in}} a pre-entry manner, that is, the robot starts to perceive the terrain in front of itself. On the other hand, reactive terrain perception considers post-entry classification or recognition of terrain on which the robot perceives. In the case of reactive terrain perception, usually, researchers use inertial measurement unit (IMU) like sensors as described in [7]. The authors have modeled the vibration to classify terrain. Amongst other important works, [8]-[12] are notable. There are multiple sensors used in all these works, such as <b>gyros,</b> accelerometers, encoders, <b>motor</b> current and voltage sensors, multi-axis force sensor, tachometer etc. The basic disadvantage within reactive terrain perception methologies is that before entering a terrain, the robot cannot do the processing.|$|R
50|$|After {{the high}} degree of success {{achieved}} in 1962, the flight record of the D-series took {{a turn for the worse}} in 1963. The first flight of the year, Missile 39D, went awry when high thrust section temperatures caused total propulsion system failure two minutes into launch. The malfunction was traced to the sustainer insulation boot breaking off at liftoff, which allowed exhaust gases to recirculate in the thrust section. Three Atlas Ds then successfully tested Nike-Zeus target missiles. On March 10, Atlas 102D was launched on an operational test from 576-B3. The missile began to tumble out of control shortly after liftoff and self-destructed at T+33 seconds, showering the area around the pad with flaming debris. Investigation of the failure found that the pitch <b>gyro</b> spin <b>motor</b> was either not running or the rotation speed was too low, and that 102D was still using the old Type B gyro canisters which did not have the Spin Motor Rotation Detection System (SMRD). The SMRD had been conceived back in 1958 after the first Atlas B failed in flight due to an inoperative yaw gyro, but was not phased into Atlas vehicles until 1961. Missile 102D had not been upgraded to the newer Type D gyros which had the SMRD, and a quick examination of the Atlas inventory at VAFB found two more missiles with Type B gyros. They were replaced with spare Type D canisters from Project Mercury.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} {{methodology}} for inferring terrain parameters from estimated terrain forces {{in order to}} allow wheeled autonomous vehicles to assess mobility in real-time. Terrain force estimation can be used to infer the ability to accelerate, climb, or tow a load independent of the underlying terrain model. When a terrain model is available, physical soil properties and stress distribution parameters that relate to mobility are inferred from vehicle-terrain forces using multiple-model estimation. The approach uses Bayesian statistics to select the most likely terrain parameters from a set of hypotheses, given estimated terrain forces. The hypotheses are based on the extensive literature of soil properties for soils with cohesions from 1 – 70 kPa. Terrain parameter estimation is subject to mathematical uniqueness of the net forces resulting from vehicle-terrain interaction for a given set of terrain parameters; uniqueness properties are characterized in the paper motivating the approach. Terrain force and parameter estimation requires proprioceptive sensors – accelerometers, rate <b>gyros,</b> wheel speeds, <b>motor</b> currents, and ground speed. Simulation results demonstrate efficacy of the method on three terrains – low cohesion sand, sandy loam, and high cohesion clay, with parameter convergence times as low as. 02 sec. The method exhibits an ability to interpolate between hypotheses when no single hypothesis adequately characterizes the terrain...|$|R
