40|$|An {{ergonomic}} {{study of}} operator cabs for grab unloaders is presented herein. Our results {{demonstrated that the}} drivers adopted poor postures, partially owing to the basic geometry {{of the situation and}} partially because they used only the central <b>lower</b> <b>front</b> <b>window</b> for downward vision and control boxes obstructed vision.

40|$|Abstract—Cars have {{various types}} of doors. The {{swinging}} doors which {{are the most common}} are almost the most complicated parts in a car since they not only determine the general guidelines of car style, but also are vital for passenger's safety by protecting humans from side crashes. Comparison between FEA results and targets led to the necessity to split <b>lower</b> opening of <b>front</b> door into two parts to increase stiffness. Also, thickness of window regulator engine fixing in both front and rear doors are increased. Predetermined values from previous works conducted on a similar existing SUV vehicle were used as targets to be achieved by Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of car doors. Mobile hinge fixing is duplicated for both front and rear doors Inner panel opening in <b>front</b> door <b>window</b> <b>lower</b> mechanism are also decreased...|$|R
50|$|Polly Newton {{headed up}} the Morgan County Chapter of the Red Cross {{for well over a}} decade {{and was one of the}} key Madisonians to re-establish the local Episcopal Church, she {{conducting}} the first confirmation classes. Very involved in city and school affairs, she served on the Board of the Cultural Center and was the longest-serving head of the local chapter of the DAR. She also spearheaded the effort during the 60’s to rename Second Street, choosing “Academy Street” in recognition of the several early 19th century academies located along that street. Around 1960, Col. Ed and Polly started calling it the “Carter-Newton House” and made many improvements including modernizing the kitchen and rear porch area, removing the dark Queen Anne Style front door and installing an “original looking” front door and frame, putting small panes in the <b>lower</b> <b>front</b> <b>windows,</b> making “French doors” of two windows in the dining room, and adding a small back porch.|$|R
5000|$|The one-box design {{eliminated}} B-pillars and featured an aluminium structure, aluminium panels for {{the greenhouse}} {{and a full}} sunroof of strengthened heat-reflecting glass. The interior featured four seats each with built-in seatbelts and Bridge of Weir leather. [...] To facilitate access to the rear seats, two long doors featured a double parallel-opening hinge system (marketed as [...] "double-kinematic") that maximized access with minimal outswing of the doors. <b>Front</b> side <b>windows</b> <b>lowered</b> automatically when either of the front seats folded forward to further facilitate entry to the rear two seats. Windows featured power-deployable sunshades, and the H-points of the rear two seats were higher than the forward two seats, giving the Avantime [...] "theater seating." [...] The luggage compartment featured a retaining system using retractable straps, and all Avantimes featured a two-tone look created by the exposed aluminium of the greenhouse. The windows and panoramic sunroof could open automatically via a single, headliner mounted control, to give the Avantime an 'open air' mode.|$|R

6000|$|Rachel, alighting, {{saw that}} the lane {{proceeded}} downwards to a river crossed by a wooden bridge, with an expanse of meadows beyond. To her left was a stable-yard, and below it a white gate and white railings enclosing a graveyard, with a very beautiful church standing behind a mushroom yew-tree. The upper boundary of the churchyard was the clipped yew hedge of the rectory garden, whose front entrance was through the churchyard. There was a lovely cool tranquillity of aspect as the shadows lay sleeping on the grass; and Rachel could have stood and gazed, but Alick opened the gate, {{and there was a}} movement at the seat that enclosed the gnarled trunk of the yew tree. A couple of village lads touched their caps and departed the opposite way, a white setter dog bounded forward, and, closely attended by a still snowier cat, a gentleman came to meet them, so fearlessly treading the pathway between the graves, and so youthful in figure, that it was only the [...] "Well, uncle, here she is," [...] and, [...] "Alick, my dear boy," [...] that convinced her that this was indeed Mr. Clare. The next moment he had taken her hand, kissed her brow, and spoken a few words of fatherly blessing, then, while Alick exchanged greetings with the cat and dog, he led her to the arched yew-tree entrance to his garden, up two stone steps, along a flagged path across the narrow grass-plat in front of the old two-storied house, with a tiled verandah like an eyebrow to the <b>lower</b> <b>front</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|R
