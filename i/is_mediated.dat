One of those is the cytoplasmic Ski complex, which includes an RNA helicase (Ski2) and is involved in mRNA degradation. In the nucleus, the processing of rRNA and snoRNA by the exosome <b>is</b> <b>mediated</b> by the TRAMP complex, which contains both RNA helicase (Mtr4) and polyadenylation (Trf4) activity.|$|E

It <b>is</b> <b>mediated</b> by a circadian oscillator in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain (central clock), which causes the kidney (peripheral clock) to secrete potassium in this rhythmic circadian fashion.|$|E
5000|$|Glucocorticoids such as {{cortisol}} affect carbohydrate, fat, {{and protein}} metabolism, and have anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, anti-proliferative, and vasoconstrictive effects. Anti-inflammatory effects <b>are</b> <b>mediated</b> by blocking {{the action of}} inflammatory mediators (transrepression) and inducing anti-inflammatory mediators (transactivation). Immunosuppressive effects <b>are</b> <b>mediated</b> by suppressing delayed hypersensitivity reactions by direct action on T-lymphocytes. Anti-proliferative effects <b>are</b> <b>mediated</b> by inhibition of DNA synthesis and epidermal cell turnover. Vasoconstrictive effects <b>are</b> <b>mediated</b> by inhibiting the action of inflammatory mediators such as histidine.|$|R

Before birth, waves <b>are</b> <b>mediated</b> by non-synaptic currents, waves {{during the period from}} birth until ten days after birth <b>are</b> <b>mediated</b> by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine acting on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, waves during the third period from ten days after birth to two weeks later <b>are</b> <b>mediated</b> by ionotropic glutamate receptors.|$|R
5|$|The term {{viral tropism}} {{refers to the}} cell types a virus infects. HIV can infect a variety of immune cells such as CD4+ T cells, macrophages, and microglial cells. HIV-1 entry to macrophages and CD4+ T cells <b>is</b> <b>mediated</b> through {{interaction}} of the virion envelope glycoproteins (gp120) with the CD4 molecule on the target cells and also with chemokine coreceptors.|$|E
5|$|Type II {{hypersensitivity}} {{occurs when}} antibodies bind to antigens on the patient's own cells, marking them for destruction. This is also called antibody-dependent (or cytotoxic) hypersensitivity, and <b>is</b> <b>mediated</b> by IgG and IgM antibodies.|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} by quantum chromodynamics, {{the strong interaction between}} quarks <b>is</b> <b>mediated</b> by gluons, massless vector gauge bosons. Each gluon carries one color charge and one anticolor charge. In the standard framework of particle interactions (part {{of a more}} general formulation known as perturbation theory), gluons are constantly exchanged between quarks through a virtual emission and absorption process. When a gluon is transferred between quarks, a color change occurs in both; for example, if a red quark emits a red–antigreen gluon, it becomes green, and if a green quark absorbs a red–antigreen gluon, it becomes red. Therefore, while each quark's color constantly changes, their strong interaction is preserved.|$|E

5|$|Hypersensitivity is {{an immune}} {{response}} that damages the body's own tissues. They {{are divided into}} four classes (Type I– IV) based on the mechanisms involved and {{the time course of}} the hypersensitive reaction. Type I hypersensitivity is an immediate or anaphylactic reaction, often associated with allergy. Symptoms can range from mild discomfort to death. Type I hypersensitivity <b>is</b> <b>mediated</b> by IgE, which triggers degranulation of mast cells and basophils when cross-linked by antigen.|$|E
5|$|The quarks {{are held}} {{together}} by the strong interaction (or strong force), which <b>is</b> <b>mediated</b> by gluons. The protons and neutrons, in turn, are held {{to each other in}} the nucleus by the nuclear force, which is a residuum of the strong force that has somewhat different range-properties (see the article on the nuclear force for more). The gluon is a member of the family of gauge bosons, which are elementary particles that mediate physical forces.|$|E
5|$|Ørsted did {{not fully}} {{understand}} his discovery, but he observed the effect was reciprocal: a current exerts a force on a magnet, and a magnetic field exerts a force on a current. The phenomenon was further investigated by Ampère, who discovered that two parallel current-carrying wires exerted a force upon each other: two wires conducting currents {{in the same direction}} are attracted to each other, while wires containing currents in opposite directions are forced apart. The interaction <b>is</b> <b>mediated</b> by the magnetic field each current produces and forms the basis for the international definition of the ampere.|$|E

5|$|Each {{chromatophore}} contains pigment of {{only one}} colour. In fish and frogs, colour change <b>is</b> <b>mediated</b> {{by the type of}} chromatophores known as melanophores that contain dark pigment. A melanophore is star-shaped; it contains many small pigmented organelles which can be dispersed throughout the cell, or aggregated near its centre. When the pigmented organelles are dispersed, the cell makes a patch of the animal's skin appear dark; when they are aggregated, most of the cell, and the animal's skin, appears light. In frogs, the change is controlled relatively slowly, mainly by hormones. In fish, the change is controlled by the brain, which sends signals directly to the chromatophores, as well as producing hormones.|$|E
5|$|Tellurium has {{no known}} {{biological}} function, although fungi can incorporate {{it in place}} of sulfur and selenium into amino acids such as telluro-cysteine and telluro-methionine. Organisms have shown a highly variable tolerance to tellurium compounds. Many bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, take up tellurite and reduce it to elemental tellurium, which accumulates and causes a characteristic and often dramatic darkening of cells. In yeast, this reduction <b>is</b> <b>mediated</b> by the sulfate assimilation pathway. Tellurium accumulation seems to account for {{a major part of}} the toxicity effects. Many organisms also metabolize tellurium partly to form dimethyl telluride, although dimethyl ditelluride is also formed by some species. Dimethyl telluride has been observed in hot springs at very low concentrations.|$|E
5|$|The nerve {{dysfunction}} in Guillain–Barré {{syndrome is}} caused by an immune attack on the nerve cells of the peripheral nervous system and their support structures. The nerve cells have their body (the soma) in the spinal cord and a long projection (the axon) that carries electrical nerve impulses to the neuromuscular junction where the impulse is transferred to the muscle. Axons are wrapped in a sheath of Schwann cells that contain myelin. Between Schwann cells are gaps (nodes of Ranvier) where the axon is exposed. Different types of Guillain–Barré syndrome feature different types of immune attack. The demyelinating variant (AIDP, see below) features damage to the myelin sheath by white blood cells (T lymphocytes and macrophages); this process is preceded by activation {{of a group of}} blood proteins known as complement. In contrast, the axonal variant <b>is</b> <b>mediated</b> by IgG antibodies and complement against the cell membrane covering the axon without direct lymphocyte involvement.|$|E

5|$|Under certain conditions, protons can {{re-enter}} the mitochondrial matrix without {{contributing to}} ATP synthesis. This process {{is known as}} proton leak or mitochondrial uncoupling and {{is due to the}} facilitated diffusion of protons into the matrix. The process results in the unharnessed potential energy of the proton electrochemical gradient being released as heat. The process <b>is</b> <b>mediated</b> by a proton channel called thermogenin, or UCP1. Thermogenin is a 33 kDa protein first discovered in 1973. Thermogenin is primarily found in brown adipose tissue, or brown fat, and is responsible for non-shivering thermogenesis. Brown adipose tissue is found in mammals, and is at its highest levels in early life and in hibernating animals. In humans, brown adipose tissue is present at birth and decreases with age.|$|E
