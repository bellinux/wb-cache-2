Through a complex progression of world events and largely brought about in response to armed conflict, modern <b>humanitarian</b> <b>aid</b> is provided by a multitude of organizations and actors. The purpose of this chapter {{is to provide a}} brief overview of the history of humanitarian action, a review of the principles of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>aid</b> and an overview of the major documents which delineate those principles.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} researching and mapping the <b>humanitarian</b> <b>aid</b> {{provided}} to foreign countries and with involving {{into the international}} rescue operations of the basic and other components of the Integrated Rescue System of the Czech Republic. The State <b>Humanitarian</b> <b>Aid</b> of the Czech Republic abroad is performed and financed from the financial means allocated by the government from the state budget into the bound reserve of the General Financial Administration for the given year for the <b>humanitarian</b> <b>aid.</b> The partial target of the thesis is to submit the complete information about the international rescue missions and providing individual kinds of the <b>humanitarian</b> <b>aid</b> abroad.

The aim of this thesis is to ascertain specifics of Czech <b>humanitarian</b> <b>aid</b> provided to Ukraine, its main influences and to determine to what extent it is possible to apply these characteristic to Czech <b>humanitarian</b> <b>aid</b> in broad sense. In the thesis are thus analysed the very definition of relief aid, its considerable aspects and current trends. These trends are in the same time linked to Czech <b>humanitarian</b> <b>aid</b> and their influence is examined. The thesis also explores and examines the crisis in Ukraine, since its' specific context influenced Czech <b>humanitarian</b> <b>aid.</b> Czech <b>humanitarian</b> <b>aid</b> is analysed by means of qualitative approach. The core of this approach is based on interviews with prominent people employed in the humanitarian sector and on analysis of humanitarian policy of the Czech state and of selected humanitarian non-governmental organizations: ADRA Czech Republic, the Czech Red Cross, People in need, Caritas Czech Republic, and Doctors without borders Czech Republic.

Empirically, it explores the interaction between EU <b>humanitarian</b> <b>aid</b> and development cooperation, the Common Foreign and Security Policy, and trade policy. While the independence of the <b>humanitarian</b> <b>aid</b> delivery is, for the most part, not being undermined, it remains difficult to establish positive synergies with other external policies because of institutional hurdles and legal constraints, as well as political obstacles and operational incompatibilities...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedWhen a disaster occurs during a conflict, the security concerns {{and need for}} <b>humanitarian</b> <b>aid</b> can increase; survivors need both, but often {{the government needs to}} choose which takes precedence and <b>humanitarian</b> <b>aid</b> can fall by the wayside. This thesis examines the impacts of political and military hindrances in conflicts between armed groups and governments on the Red Cross Movement's <b>humanitarian</b> <b>aid</b> delivery during disaster response following the declaration of the war on terror. This thesis is in two parts. The first part establishes the environment in which the Red Cross Movement operates and the attitude toward <b>humanitarian</b> <b>aid</b> in conflict. The second part analyzes the disaster response in three cases, along with the security issues that led to restrictive environments for <b>humanitarian</b> <b>aid</b> and underserved populations.

5000|$|<b>Humanitarian</b> <b>aid</b> is {{material}} and logistic assistance {{to people who}} need help. It is usually short-term help until the long-term help by government and other institutions replaces it. A report published by the network of European Universities on Professionalization of Humanitarian Action noted that <b>humanitarian</b> <b>aid</b> is a [...] "fundamental expression of the universal value of solidarity between people and a moral imperative." [...] Among the people in need belong homeless, refugees, victims of natural disasters, wars and famines. The primary purpose of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>aid</b> is to save lives, reduce suffering and respect to human dignity. <b>Humanitarian</b> <b>aid</b> is material or logistical assistance provided for humanitarian purposes, typically in response to humanitarian crises including natural disasters and man-made disaster. The primary objective of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>aid</b> is to save lives, alleviate suffering, and maintain human dignity. It may therefore be distinguished from development aid, which seeks to address the underlying socioeconomic factors which {{may have led to}} a crisis or emergency.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This paper aims {{to provide}} a {{commentary}} and an overview of developments {{in the field of}} humanitarianism that could impact theoretical understanding of agility in <b>humanitarian</b> <b>aid</b> supply chains over the past decade. Design/methodology/approach: Authors review papers published on agility in <b>humanitarian</b> <b>aid</b> supply chains from 2006 to 2015 in the four leading Emerald-published logistics and supply chain management journals. These are: Supply Chain Management : An International Journal (SCMIJ); International Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management (IJPDLM); International Journal of Operations and Production Management (IJOPM); and Journal of Humanitarian Logistics and Supply Chain Management (JHLSCM). This paper presents an overview and update of developments that have the potential to influence current thinking and understanding about agility in <b>humanitarian</b> <b>aid</b> supply chains, and <b>humanitarian</b> <b>aid</b> supply chains in general. Findings: Humanitarianism and the environment of Humanitarian organisations are evolving. Such evolution has potential impacts on theoretical discussions and understanding of agility in <b>humanitarian</b> <b>aid</b> supply chains and <b>humanitarian</b> <b>aid</b> supply chains in general. Research limitations/implications: This is not a critical literature review but an overview. The paper is based on four logistics and supply chain management journals only. However, the paper is based on the work published over a decade. Practical implications: Points scholars and practitioners to the impacts of Humanitarian Organisations using the relief-development continuum on supply chain design decisions including the pursuit of agility. Social implications: It may be the time to consider the relief-development continuum in fresh light and its implications for agility in <b>humanitarian</b> <b>aid</b> supply chains. Originality/value: This paper seems to be the first paper that highlights the influence of the relief-development continuum model on <b>humanitarian</b> <b>aid</b> supply chain design strategies...|$|R
