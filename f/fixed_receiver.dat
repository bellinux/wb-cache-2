50|$|An {{acoustic}} emission (AE) sensor {{works on}} principle of measuring the high-frequency energy signals produced during cutting process. It also measures the AE energy {{resulting from the}} fracture when a tool breaks. It is best suited to applications where the level of background AE signal is low compared {{to the sound of}} tool breakage. This makes the AE sensor ideal for breakage detection of small drills and taps. It is easy to install on both new and existing machines. AE sensor detects force proportional monitoring signals even in machining operations, which generate very small cutting forces. In combination with true power, it increases the reliability of breakage monitoring. It is used especially with solid carbide tools, or very small tools on large machines and multi spindles. Most of the sensors have to be attached to the machine tool surface. However, there are alternative methods of AE wave transmitting. A rotating, wireless AE sensor consists of a rotating sensor and a <b>fixed</b> <b>receiver.</b> An AE sensor can also receive the acoustic waves via a jet of cooling lubricant, which can be connected directly to the tool or workpiece.|$|E

Firstly, a novel synchronization method using the direct-path signal, which can be collected by a dedicated antenna, is proposed and applied. The synchronization error can be completely removed using the proposed method. However, {{as the cost of}} synchronization, the characteristic of synchronized echo’s range history becomes quite different from that of general bistatic SAR data. To focus this particular synchronized data, its 2 -D spectrum is derived under linear approximations and then a frequency-domain imaging algorithm using two-dimensional inverse scaled Fourier transform (2 -DISFT) is proposed. At last, the proposed integrative synchronization and imaging algorithm is verified by simulations.|$|E

30|$|The {{calculation}} of an analytical bistatic point-target reference spectrum (BPTRS) {{is the key}} to develop frequency-domain imaging algorithm, since the bistatic range history loses its hyperbolic form [28]. Based on the approximate BPTRS, including Loffeld bistatic formula (LBF) [29, 30] and series reversion [31], several image formations have been proposed. The 2 -DISFT [32] algorithm and chirp scaling (CS) algorithm [33] were developed from LBF for corresponding bistatic configurations. Based on the series reversion method, a non-linear CS (NLCS) process was applied to equalize the azimuth chirp rate in bistatic SAR focusing for general configuration [34], and a range Doppler (RD) algorithm was proposed to handle the azimuth-invariant bistatic case [35]. In bistatic SAR with a <b>fixed</b> <b>receiver</b> configuration, a two-dimensional NLCS processor was applied in [36] to deal with the large bistatic angle case.

Reliable receiving of the 4  K UHD layer data in mobile channels may not be achievable because the TOV’s at every transmission parameter were above 26  dB. However, <b>fixed</b> <b>receivers</b> were assumed for the 4  K UHD layer transmission, as described in Section 3 – 1, and a TOV at 4 to 5  dB higher CNR than the AWGN may be required for a static channel situation of the <b>fixed</b> <b>receivers.</b> In the case of HD layer data transmission, BER performances under TU- 6 are more important than for 4  K UHD layers.
