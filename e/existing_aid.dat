50|$|In {{the past}} decade, the aid {{environment}} has dramatically changed. Emerging economies (China, India, Saudi Arabia, Korea, Turkey, Brazil, Venezuela, etc.), {{which are still}} receiving aid from Western countries, have become donors themselves. Multinational corporations, philanthropists, international NGOs and civil society have matured into major players as well. Even though the rise of new development partners had {{the positive effect of}} bringing an increased variety of financing, know-how and skills to the development community, {{at the same time it}} has shaken up the <b>existing</b> <b>aid</b> system. This is particularly true in the case of emerging economies, as they do not feel compelled to conform to traditional donors’ norms. Generally demanding conditionality in return for assistance, which means tying aid to the procurement of goods and services, they are challenging traditional development aid standards.|$|E
5000|$|Petra Debusscher of Ghent University {{has criticized}} EU aid {{agencies}} for following an “integrationist approach” to gender mainstreaming, where gender mainstreaming {{is used to}} achieve existing policy goals, {{as opposed to a}} “transformative approach” which seeks to change policy priorities and programs fundamentally to achieve gender equality. She finds that this approach more closely follows a Women in Development model than a Gender and Development one. Debussher criticized the EU’s development policy in Latin America for focusing too much attention on gender inequality as a problem to be solved for women. She found that the language used represented more of a Woman in Development approach than a Gender and Development Approach. She notes that men’s role in domestic violence is insufficiently brought forward, with program and policy instead targeting removing women from victimhood. Rather than discussing the role of men and women relative to each other, women are discussed as needing to “catch up with an implicit male norm.” Debussher also criticized EU’s development aid to Southern Africa as too narrow in its scope and too reliant on integrating women and gender into <b>existing</b> <b>aid</b> paradigms. Debusscher notes that women’s organizations in the region are often concerned with different social constructions of gender, as opposed to the economic growth structure favored by the EU. For EU development aid to Europe and surrounding countries, Debsusscher argued that programs to encourage education of women were designed primarily to encourage overall economic growth, not to target familial and social inequalities.|$|E

40|$|This paper designs a new equalization‐aid formula {{based on}} fiscal gaps of local communities. Using {{conceptual}} analysis and simulations with Massachusetts data, the authors illustrate the tradeoffs that policymakers face in deciding {{on the policy}} variables in the formula and lay out several general guidelines for setting up these variables. When states are in transition to a new local aid formula, {{the issue of whether}} and how to hold <b>existing</b> <b>aid</b> harmless poses a challenge. The authors show that previous studies and the formulas derived from them give differential weights to existing and new aid in filling the gap and hence effectively treat communities receiving greater amounts of <b>existing</b> <b>aid</b> more favorably than communities receiving less or no <b>existing</b> <b>aid.</b> As a fairer alternative, the authors propose a new approach that considers existing and new aid within a consistent framework by taking account of both in filling the gap. In addition, unlike previous research that focuses only on a single year’s new aid distribution, the authors simulate the dynamics of aid distributions over multiple years and examine their evolution over time. The authors further provide and compare several possible solutions to addressing the possible tradeoffs between short‐term and long‐term goals. Although the proposed aid formula is designed for municipal aid and tailored to Massachusetts, the authors note that foundation aid formulas for education implicitly treat <b>existing</b> <b>aid</b> in the same way and suggest that the framework, principles, and policy recommendations might also be applicable to other states designing new municipal aid formulas...|$|E

The article outlines women candidates’ performance, details {{challenges faced by}} women, examines <b>existing</b> <b>aid</b> work designed to help women candidates and provides policy suggestions. The article argues that <b>existing</b> <b>aid</b> policy focused on candidate training and voter education has achieved little because the main impediments women candidates face are access to finance and local gatekeepers, alongside more subtle normative constraints. These are barriers that are not easily shifted by training or education programs. Meanwhile, for reasons of political economy, another area of aid-supported engagement, a parliamentary gender quota, {{is unlikely to be}} enacted. Reflecting this, {{and the nature of the}} challenges women candidates face, the article recommends donors also undertake work to help prospective women candidates engage with communities over time, building ties and reputations as providers of assistance...|$|E
40|$|Many {{states have}} {{implemented}} educational grant systems {{designed to provide}} more aid to school districts that are, by some standard, in greater need. Never-theless, many if not most central city school systems continue to produce poor educational outcomes, as measured, for example, by test scores and dropout rates. Using data from New York State, this article asks why <b>existing</b> <b>aid</b> formulas fail to provide the assistance that central city school districts need to bring their educational outcomes up to reasonable standards. Two principal explanations are explored: the failure of <b>existing</b> <b>aid</b> programs to recognize {{the high cost of}} providing education in central cities and the possibility that aid simply makes central cities less efficient without raising educational outcomes. The article presents aid programs that account for costs, but shows that these revised programs will do little to help central cities without at least one politi-cally unpopular provision, namely a large state budget or a high required local property tax rate.

To address this concern, this policy brief provides a new, more equitable approach that allocates smaller aid cuts to communities that are in worse underlying fiscal health and received less <b>existing</b> <b>aid.</b> We use a “need-capacity gap” to represent underlying fiscal health, which is measured based on local economic and social characteristics outside the direct control of local officials.

The second is the more recent work performed on post-conflict aid, which indicates that post-conflict countries may have higher aid absorption capacity than other countries at similar poverty and institutional levels.
