40|$|Flow-generated noise, {{especially}} rotorcraft noise {{has been}} a serious concern for both commercial and military applications. A particular important noise source for rotorcraft is Blade-Vortex-Interaction (BVI) noise, a high amplitude, impulsive sound that often dominates other rotorcraft noise sources. In this thesis the research is to formulate and implement efficient computational tools for the development and study of optimal control and design strategies for complex flow/acoustic systems with emphasis on rotorcraft applications, especially BVI noise control problem. The main purpose of aeroacoustic computations {{is to determine the}} sound intensity and directivity far away from the noise source. However, the computational cost of using a high-fidelity flow-physics model across the full domain is usually prohibitive and it might also be less accurate because of the numerical diffusion and other problems. Taking advantage of the multi-physics and multi-scale structure of this aeroacoustic problem, we develop a multi-model, multi-domain (near-field/farfield) method based on a discontinuous Galerkin discretization. In this approach the coupling of multi-domains and multi-models is achieved by weakly enforcing continuity of normal fluxes across a coupling surface. For our interested aeroacoustics control problem, the adjoint equations that determine the sensitivity of the cost functional to changes in control are also solved with same approach by weakly enforcing continuity of normal fluxes across a coupling surface. Such formulations have been validated extensively for several aeroacoustics state and control problems. A multi-model based optimal control framework has been constructed and applied to our interested BVI noise control problem. This model problem consists of the interaction of a compressible vortex with Bell AH- 1 rotor blade with wall-normal velocity used as control on the rotor blade surface. The computational domain is decomposed into the near-field and far-field. The near-field is obtained by numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equations while far away from the noise source, where the effect of nonlinearities is negligible, the linearized Euler equations are used to model the acoustic wave propagation. The BVI wave packet is targeted by defining an objective function that measures the square amplitude of pressure fluctuations in an observation region, at a time interval encompassing the dominant leading edge compressibility waves. Our control results show that a 12 dB reduction in the observation region is obtained. Interestingly, the control mechanism focuses on the observation region and only minimize the sound level in that region {{at the expense of other}} regions. The vortex strength and trajectory get barely changed. However, the optimal control does alter the interaction of the vortical and potential fields, which is the source of BVI noise. While this results in a slight increase in drag, there is a significant reduction in the temporal <b>gradient</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> leading to a reduction in BVI sound levels.

40|$|The {{emphasis}} of {{the second year of}} the European Project AEROSHAPE has been the extension of the optimization tools. Consequently DLR focused on the extension of the continuous adjoint approach to handle arbitrary aerodynamic constraints and complex 3 D geometries. Therefore the adjoint Euler solver FLOWer has been extended to the adjoint boundary treatments necessary to obtain the adjoint <b>gradients</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> and pitching moment. Previously, only the adjoint boundary treatments of the optimization problems of drag reduction and drag reduction by constant lift were available. A feasible direction method, by which the projection <b>of</b> the <b>gradient</b> <b>of</b> the cost function onto the orthogonal subspace of the aerodynamic constraints is used, has been developed. Furthermore, a surface formulation for the adjoint <b>gradients</b> <b>of</b> drag, <b>lift</b> and pitching moment has been derived, implemented and validated...|$|R

Faithful reproductions {{of the ice}} shapes were cast in silicone rubber from which wind tunnel models were made. They were tested using a specifically designed wind tunnel rig which measured the aerodynamic lift, drag and pitching moment of the models. From the aerodynamic data the <b>gradients</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift,</b> drag and pitching moment of each ice shape were calculated. The aerodynamic data were consequently used in a two-dimensional two degree of freedom theoretical aerodynamic model which included aerodynamic lift, drag, moment, ice eccentricity, conductor wake effects and the mechanical properties of the conductor. Wind tunnel tests were carried out on a specifically designed wind tunnel dynamic rig. Instabilities of the coupled vertical/torsional galloping were established. Regions of instability were also predicted using a two-dimensional theoretical conductor model. The initial theoretical analysis formed the basis upon which a more sophisticated three-dimensional finite element aeroelastic model was developed. The effects of ice and wind on the natural frequencies and {{the stability of the}} conductor were investigated. The use of galloping control devices, the pendulum detuners was also examined. Results showed that the pendulums had a stabilising effect in controlling the vertical/torsional frequency ratio of twin bundles. The vibration characteristics and the stability of quad bundles were investigated using finite elements. In this case, the pendulums shifted the torsional frequencies of the bundle to higher values close to the corresponding vertical frequencies, thus enhancing coupling and having an adverse effect on stability. Finally, limitations in the performance of the pendulum detuners were predicted...|$|R
40|$|Optimal {{control theory}} is {{combined}} with the numerical simulation of an incompressible viscous flow to control vortex shedding {{in order to maximize}} lift. A two-dimensional flat plate model is considered at a high angle of attack and a Reynolds number of 300. Actuation is provided by unsteady mass injection near the trailing edge and is modeled by a compact body force. The adjoint of the linearized perturbed equations is solved backwards in time to obtain the <b>gradient</b> <b>of</b> the <b>lift</b> to changes in actuation (the jet velocity), and this information is used to iteratively improve the controls. The optimized control waveform is nearly periodic and locked to vortex shedding. We compare the results with sinusoidal open- and closed-loop control and observe that the optimized control is able to achieve higher lift than the sinusoidal forcing with more than 50 % lower momentum coefficients. The optimized waveform is also implemented in a simple closed-loop controller where the control signal is shifted or deformed periodically to adjust to the (instantaneous) frequency <b>of</b> the <b>lift</b> fluctuations. The feedback utilizes a narrowband filter and an Extended Kalman Filter to robustly estimate the phase of vortex shedding and achieve phase-locked, high lift flow states...|$|R
40|$|A {{discrete}} adjoint of the Navier-Stokes equations {{has been}} developed in the unstructured finite-volume solver the DLR-TAU-code. The method consists of the explicit construction of the exact Jacobian of the spatial discretization {{with respect to the}} unknown variables allowing the adjoint equations to be formulated and solved. A wide range of the spatial discretizations available in TAU have been differentiated, including the Spallart-Almaras-Edwards one-equation, and the Wilcox k-omega two-equation turbulence models. The aim {{of this paper is to}} give an overview of the capabilities of the discrete adjoint to perform aerodynamic shape optimization in viscous flow. The strategy developed is extensively validated on 2 D cases. The adjoint based design method is first validated by comparing the <b>gradients</b> <b>of</b> the drag, <b>lift</b> and pitching moment it produces with the approximate gradients obtained by finite-differences. Then the accuracy and efficiency of the approach are demonstrated for transonic airfoil design by considering geometric as well aerodynamic constraints, single- as well as multi-point design.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{flow control}} and the potentially favorable effects of feedback, associated with unsteady actuation in separated flows over airfoils. The objective of the flow control is to enhance lift at post-stall angles of attack by changing {{the dynamics of the}} wake vortices. We present results from a numerical study of unsteady actuation on a two-dimensional flat plate at post-stall angles of attack at Reynolds number (Re) of 300 and 3000. At Re= 300, the control waveform is optimized and a feedback strategy is developed to optimize the phase of the control relative to the lift with either a sinusoidal or the optimized waveform, resulting in a high-lift limit cycle of vortex shedding. Also at Re= 3000, we show that certain frequencies and actuator waveforms lead to stabl(high-lift) limit cycles, in which the flow is phase locked to the actuation. First, a two-dimensional flat plate model at a high angle of attack at a Re of 300 is considered. We design the feedback to slightly adjust the frequency and/or phase of actuation to lock it to a particular phase <b>of</b> the <b>lift,</b> thus achieving a phase-locked flow with the maximal period-averaged lift over every cycle of acutation. With the sinusoidal forcing and feedback, we show {{that it is possible to}} optimize the phase of the control relative to the lift in order to achieve the highest possible period-averaged lift in a consistent fashion. However, continuous sinusoidal forcing could be adding circulation when it is unnecessary, or undesirable. Thus we employ an adjoint-based optimization in order to find the waveform (time history of the jet velocty) that maximizes the lift for a given actuation amplitude. The adjoint of the linearized perturbed equations is solved backwards in time to obtain the <b>gradient</b> <b>of</b> the <b>lift</b> to changes in actuation (the jet velocity), and this information is used to iteratively improve the controls. Optimal control provides a periodic control waveform, resulting in high lift shedding cycle with minimal control input. However, if applied in open loop, the flow fails to phase lock onto the optimal waveform, degrading the lift performance. Thus, the optimized waveform is also implemented in a closed-loop controller where the control signal is shifted or deformed periodically to adjust to the (instantaneous) frequency <b>of</b> the <b>lift</b> fluctuations. The feedback utilizes a narrowband filter and an Extended Kalman Filter to robustly estimate the phase of vortex shedding and achieve phase-locked, high lift flow states. Feedback control of the optimized waveform is able to reproduce the high-lift limit cycle from the optimization, but starting from an arbitrary phase of the baseline limit cycle. Finally, we apply the tools developed and knowledge gained at Re= 300 to a Re of 3000 on a thin airfoil with a thickness-to-chord ratio of 4...|$|R
