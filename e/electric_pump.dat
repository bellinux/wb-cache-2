5|$|The first Curry Moor {{pumping station}} {{was built in}} 1864, to house a steam engine and pump. A cottage for the {{operator}} was built next to {{it at the same}} time. This installation lasted until 1955, when a new pumphouse was constructed to house two diesel pumps. The steam engine was retained for historical reasons, and is located in part of the new building. The diesel pumps were supplemented by an <b>electric</b> <b>pump</b> in 1983, and a programme of refurbishment was carried out in 2008, which included {{the construction of a new}} outfall into the river.|$|E
25|$|Internal filters are, by definition, filters {{within the}} {{confines}} of the aquarium. These include the sponge filter, variations on the corner filter (pictured top right and left), foam cartridge filter and the undergravel filter. An internal filter may have an <b>electric</b> <b>pump</b> and thus be an internal power filter, often attached to the inside of aquaria via suction cups.|$|E
25|$|Up to 15 weeks' gestation, suction-{{aspiration}} or vacuum aspiration are {{the most}} common surgical methods of induced abortion. Manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) consists of removing the fetus or embryo, placenta, and membranes by suction using a manual syringe, while electric vacuum aspiration (EVA) uses an <b>electric</b> <b>pump.</b> These techniques differ in the mechanism used to apply suction, in how early in pregnancy they can be used, and in whether cervical dilation is necessary.|$|E

25|$|Edwin Link had {{developed}} a passion for flying in his boyhood years, but {{was not able to}} afford the high cost of flying lessons. So, upon leaving school in 1927, he started developing a simulator, an exercise which took him 18 months. His first pilot trainer, which debuted in 1929, resembled an overgrown toy airplane from the outside, with short wooden wings and fuselage mounted on a universal joint. Organ bellows from the Link organ factory, the business his family owned and operated in Binghamton, New York, driven by an <b>electric</b> <b>pump,</b> made the trainer pitch and roll as the pilot worked the controls.|$|E
25|$|This updated and {{improved}} version was the Model B200, which entered production in 1981. It was fitted with PT6A-42 engines, still rated at , but with improvements {{that resulted in}} greater aircraft performance. Other changes included increased maximum pressurization (to 6.5 psi differential) and changes to the cockpit layout. The Model 200C {{gave way to the}} Model B200C the same year, with the first Model B200T and Model B200CT being modified from a B200 and B200C respectively, the following year. Commencing in 1984 the B200, B200C and their derivatives were fitted with a revised landing gear retraction mechanism, actuated by hydraulic rams powered by an <b>electric</b> <b>pump</b> installed in the LH wing. This replaced the earlier electro-mechanical retraction system of gearboxes, driveshafts and chains and sprockets that was a throwback to the Twin Bonanza. At the same time the propellers fitted were changed from 3-bladed Hartzells to 3-bladed McCauleys. Forty-seven B200Cs built that year were delivered to the U.S. military, with dozens more of a similar standard ordered in subsequent years, but not given official civil model designations.|$|E
500|$|Two [...] {{twin-cylinder}} {{diesel engines}} were installed {{to aid the}} steam plant, the first in 1914 and the second in 1920. They were made by Mirrlees, and were scrapped in 1956. Following {{the demise of the}} steam engines, a Mirrlees [...] five-cylinder diesel engine, which drove a [...] pump was obtained. The first <b>electric</b> <b>pump</b> was installed in 1939, to be joined by three more in 1957, once the Mirrlees engines had been decommissioned. A new engine house was built in 1964, which held two [...] Ruston diesel engines driving [...] Gwynnes Limited pumps, and a third [...] Ruston unit, fitted with a [...] Gwynnes pump. The remaining Mirrlees engine and the first <b>electric</b> <b>pump</b> were scrapped at this time.|$|E

It also includes six tank farm locations, one <b>electric</b> <b>pump</b> station.|$|E
2500|$|Upgrading of the pumping {{stations}} continued. The {{steam engines}} at Bull Hassocks {{were replaced by}} a single Ruston [...] diesel engine with a [...] Gwynnes pump in 1940, to be supplemented by two more similar units in 1941. By 1988 two electric pumps had been installed, and the station could discharge 330 tons per minute (485 Mld). At Dirtness, the single <b>electric</b> <b>pump</b> was supplemented by two more in 1951, rated at [...] and each capable of moving 110 tons per minute (161 Mld).|$|E
2500|$|Major {{irrigation}} schemes were planned in Kamaraj's period. Dams and irrigation canals were built across higher Bhavani, Mani Muthar, Aarani, Vaigai, Amaravathi, Sathanur, Krishnagiri, Pullambadi, Parambikulam and Neyyaru among others. The Lower Bhavani Dam in Erode district brought [...] of land under cultivation. [...] of land benefited from canals constructed from the Mettur Dam. The Vaigai and Sathanur systems facilitated cultivation across {{thousands of acres}} of lands in Madurai and North Arcot districts respectively. Rs 30 crores were planned to be spent for Parambikulam River scheme, and 150 lakhs of acres of lands were brought under cultivation; one third of this (i.e. 56 lakhs of acres of land) received a permanent irrigation facility. In 1957â€“61 [...] 1,628 tanks were de-silted under the Small Irrigation Scheme, and 2,000 wells were dug with outlets. Long term loans with 25% [...] subsidy were given to farmers. In addition farmers who had dry lands were given oil engines and <b>electric</b> <b>pump</b> sets on an installment basis.|$|E
25|$|In 1949, {{the first}} <b>electric</b> <b>pumping</b> station was installed, and several more {{were built in}} the {{following}} years. Heavy rainfall in July 1968 indicated that the district was still at risk from flooding, and several more <b>electric</b> <b>pumping</b> stations were commissioned. More than half of the district now relies on pumping for its flood protection, although most stations still have a gravity outfall, to cope with breakdowns or power failures.|$|R

2500|$|The trio {{of ships}} {{incorporated}} advanced safety precautions into their designs, intended {{to mitigate the}} risk of flooding and all but eliminate the chances of foundering. Each ship featured an inner skin, a second layer of [...] thick steel above the keel which created a watertight box {{along the bottom of}} the hull known as a [...] "double bottom." [...] 15 transverse steel bulkheads reaching [...] up to E Deck (D Deck {{in the case of the}} two forward most bulkheads) divided the hulls of each ship into 16 watertight compartments, each equipped with an <b>electric</b> <b>pump</b> to remove floodwater. The compartments could be sealed by automatic doors from the bridge in the event of a collision, preventing water from spreading to other parts of the ship. Olympic and Titanic were so designed that either could stay afloat with four compartments breached. The Olympic-class liners also eliminated converse bulkheads, such as those on Lusitania and Mauretania, which separated the coal bunkers along either side of the hull from the engine rooms and boiler rooms in the center. Such an arrangement was believed to increase the risk of a ship capsizing by trapping water lengthwise along the ship and increasing her list to one side.|$|E
2500|$|Browtowe Council are {{helped by}} several organisations in the {{management}} of the canal, including Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust, The British Trust for Nature Conservation Volunteers, the Countryside Agency, Nottinghamshire County Council and Awsworth Angling Club. Because of the rich habitat that the route provides, it was declared a Local Nature Reserve in 1993. Sections of wetland habitat and open water have been created by dredging, but {{a major part of the}} council's task has been to provide alternative supplies of water, since the Eastwood section is cut off from the Langley Mill basin and the original water supply from Moorgreen Reservoir by an infilled section, and there is a [...] gap caused by open cast mining between Eastwood and Awsworth, which has destroyed the link with the water supply from Giltbrook. The need to dispose of rainwater when the Awsworth Bypass was built in 1995 provided one new source, and in 1998, an <b>electric</b> <b>pump</b> was installed to pump water from the River Erewash into the canal. Further development of the canal as an amenity took place in 1998, when the towpath and a number of bridleways connecting to the towpath were given public right of way status. The canal is well-used, by walkers, cyclists, and naturalists, with some sections available to anglers and horse riders. Nottinghamshire County Council have assisted with upgrading the towpath to provide disability access where possible.|$|E
2500|$|In 1956, work {{started on}} a new outfall for the Hobhole drain, to the {{south-east}} of the old sluices. A pumping station containing three Allen diesel engines was built, each driving a [...] pump. The station could discharge 800 tons per minute (1175 Mld) when all three pumps were running. Once the station was complete, the old sluice was blocked off. Further improvements to the drainage of the area occurred {{in the next few}} years, with a pumping station being built at Wrangle Horseshoe, at the [...] eastern edge of the district, in 1959, and the first <b>electric</b> <b>pump</b> being installed at Lade Bank pumping station in 1963. The electric motor drove a [...] pump. Two new pumping stations at Leverton and Benington were completed in 1976, again on the eastern edge and pumping directly into The Wash. The pumping station at Thorpe Culvert was managed by the Anglian Water Authority, but a replacement in 1983 was partly funded by the Fourth District. The Hobhole pumping station was modified in 1988, when the old sluice channel was reopened and the sluices were fitted with four [...] submersible electric pumps, manufactured by Flygt. The number of electric pumps at Lade Bank was increased to three in 1990. These schemes resulted in the Fourth District being awarded a Borough of Boston Civic Design Award for {{the way in which the}} buildings were renovated.|$|E
