50|$|A hoodoo (also {{called a}} tent rock, <b>fairy</b> <b>chimney</b> or earth pyramid) is a tall, thin spire of rock that {{protrudes}} {{from the bottom}} of an arid drainage basin or badland. Hoodoos, which may range from 1.5 to 45 m, typically consist of relatively soft rock topped by harder, less easily eroded stone that protects each column from the elements. They generally form within sedimentary rock and volcanic rock formations.|$|E

50|$|The {{village is}} famous for its <b>fairy</b> <b>chimney</b> rock {{formations}} named Pyramides d'Euseigne. These are small natural reliefs, which are between 10 and 15 meters tall, are crowned by a stone and were formed by the deterioration of moraines. Thanks to their relatively big weight, these blocs protect the pyramids by compressing the underlying moraine. These pyramids were shaped after the last glaciation, and after the disappearance of the glaciers which were overwhelming Hérémence and Hérens valleys, between 10'000 and 80'000 years ago.|$|E
40|$|A <b>Fairy</b> <b>Chimney</b> is a conical rock {{formation}} and typically {{found in the}} Cappadocia region of Turkey. It consists of a cap of hard rock resting on a cone-shaped pinnacle of softer rock. The geology of areas where Fairy Chimneys form typically comprises {{a thick layer of}} tuff (consolidated volcanic ash), covered by a thin layer of basalt or other volcanic rocks that are more resistant to erosion than the underlying tuff. Over time, cracks in the basalt allow the much softer tuff to be eroded and washed away. Fairy Chimneys are formed where a small cap or boulder of the original basalt remains, and protects a cone of tuff beneath it from erosion. Eventually, the tuff will be undercut {{to the extent that the}} cap falls off, and the remaining cone is then quickly eroded In this study, corrosion on the surface of <b>fairy</b> <b>chimney,</b> which is located in Selime district of Aksaray in Turkey, has been examined by digital close range photogrammetry.

40|$|The Cappadocia {{region of}} inner Anatolia has been focus of both historians and geologists {{due to its}} {{underground}} cities as well as fairy chimneys on the surface. The man-made structures were caved in soft tuffs more than 1500 years ago; thus, many researchers studied the mass properties of rackous materials {{in the region to}} evaluate as construction materials. In this study physical and chemical properties of spectacular structures, called fairy chimneys formed due to physicochemical reaction on the surface were investigated. Fairy chimneys are formed of a cap, a neck and a supporting body. Thus, samples were collected for both physical and chemical analyses of caps, necks and bodies of the fairy chimneys found in the Cappadocia region. Chemical analyses of fairy chimneys revealed that not only the chemical compositions of fairy chimneys are different from the background tuffous rocks but also the chemical composition of the <b>fairy</b> <b>chimney</b> parts, namely cap, neck and body. The chemical analysis of <b>fairy</b> <b>chimney</b> showed that cementation agents such as Fe 2 O 3 and CaO play significant role on the development of fairy chimneys. Similar to the chemical composition variations, geotechnical properties of fairy chimneys also showed variations. For example, point load index of fairy chimneys in Bagli creek is higher than those of Pasabagi creek for both neck and body. Both chemical and mechanical analyses of fairy chimneys indicated that there is a positive correlation between the content of cementations elements and mechanical properties and size of the fairy chimneys...|$|E

50|$|Göreme is a {{district}} of the Nevşehir Province in Turkey. After {{the eruption of}} Mount Erciyes about 2.6 million years ago, ash and lava formed soft rocks in the Cappadocia Region, covering a region of about 20,000 km2. The softer rock was eroded by wind and water, leaving the hard cap rock on top of pillars, forming the present-day <b>fairy</b> <b>chimneys.</b> People of Göreme, {{at the heart of}} the Cappadocia Region, realized that these soft rocks could be easily carved out to form houses, churches, monasteries. These Christian sanctuaries contain many examples of Byzantine art from the post-iconoclastic period. These frescoes are a unique artistic achievement from this period.|$|R
