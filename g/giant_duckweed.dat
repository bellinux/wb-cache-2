A {{wide variety of}} {{emergent}} zone plants thrive here, including Wild Taro, Egyptian Paspalidium (watercrown grass), Laurel oak, Muscadine grape, Peruvian Primrose Willow, cattails and many more.|$|E
50|$|In Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast), the {{transcriptional}} {{regulation of}} the INO1 gene encoding inositol-3-phosphate synthase has been studied in detail and its expression is sensitive to the availability of phospholipid precursors as well as growth phase. The {{regulation of the}} structural gene encoding 1L-myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase has also been analyzed {{at the transcriptional level}} in the aquatic angiosperm, Spirodela polyrrhiza (<b>Giant</b> <b>duckweed)</b> and the halophyte, Mesembryanthemum crystallinum (Common ice plant).|$|E
50|$|In July 2008, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Joint Genome Institute {{announced}} that the Community Sequencing Program would fund sequencing of the genome of the <b>giant</b> <b>duckweed,</b> Spirodela polyrhiza. This was a priority project for DOE in 2009. The research was intended to facilitate new biomass and bioenergy programs. The results were published in February 2014. They provide insights into how this plant is adapted to rapid growth and an aquatic lifestyle.|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the effectiveness of}} rhizoaugmentation for treating water contaminated with the nitrophenols (NPs), 2 -NP, 3 -NP, 4 -NP, and 2, 4 -dinitrophenol (2, 4 -DNP) using NP-degrading bacteria. We used 2 -NP-degrading Pseudomonas sp. (strain ONR 1), 3 -NP-degrading Cupriavidus sp. (MFR 2), 4 -NP-degrading Rhodococcus sp. (PKR 1), 2, 4 -DNP-degrading Rhodococcus sp. (DNR 2), and <b>giant</b> <b>duckweed</b> (Spirodela polyrhiza). The four bacterial strains readily colonized Spirodela roots, as approximately 1 × 105 colony-forming units [CFUs] plant- 1 to 106 - 107 CFU plant- 1. The higher populations remained stable through five sequential 2 -day degradation cycles and completely removed all four NPs within each cycle. The root-bacteria association also successfully treated wastewater effluent contaminated with NPs; 52 - 71 % of 2 -NP and 100 % of 3 -NP, 4 -NP, and 2, 4 -DNP were removed within each of five 2 -day cycles. These results demonstrate the potential of rhizoaugmentation to achieve efficient and sustainable treatment of NP-contaminated waters...|$|E
40|$|EnThe studied {{region is}} characterised by its rich flora,vegetation,and {{diversity}} of habitats,from constantly submerged areas,moving on to areas subject to tidal movements,and ending {{in areas that}} are always above water level. In many cases the relations between these various types of habitat are of great ecological importance. All of these areas are specific to the area ’s rivers and cannot be found anywhere else. The relatively modest density of the vegetation is due to human pressure exerted on the area:cementing,building embankments,and poplar fields have greatly changed the original landscape. Where human influence has been reduced,thickets of common reed (Phragmites australis) can often be found,as well as populations of floating species such as the duckweed (of the Lemna species),the <b>giant</b> <b>duckweed</b> (Salvinia natans) and the water chestnut (Trapa natans). On the edges,in other words in transitional areas between aquatic and terrestrial habitats,there are varieties of sedge (Carex elata,C. riparia) water lilies (Iris pseudoacorus),purple-loosestrifes (Lythrum salicaria),and sometimes summer snowflakes (Leucojum aestivum). Mesophyte woods,characterised less by Mediterranean and more by continental features,grow in less protruding areas, where conditions are cooler and more humid. The dominant species of these woods are:Alnus glutinosa,Fraxinus angustifolia,the bay-oak (Quercus robur) and the elm (Ulmus minor). In the low areas close to the water table,and in the floodplains not given over to the growing of poplars,there are small hygrophilous woods whose main species are the willow (Salix alba) and the white poplar (Populus alba) ...|$|E

Albania is rich in natural aquatic resources. There is a dense hydrographic network composed of streams and rivers. All the rivers flow from east to west and all debouch in the Adriatic and Ionian seas. The two big- 1...|$|E
