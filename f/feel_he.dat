5|$|At {{the end of}} 1877, PedroII paid a {{visit to}} Caxias and ascertained that he could no longer remain in office. The entire cabinet {{resigned}} on 1 January 1878. His health problems had become so troubling that he had been asking repeatedly to resign since early 1876. Caxias was not only afflicted by concerns over his declining health, but increasingly felt a sense of alienation. He did not <b>feel</b> <b>he</b> could play a relevant role in politics. He belonged to an older generation who perceived the Emperor (and consequently, the monarchy) as essential for holding the nation together.|$|E

When Mark Kinney, {{one of the}} students in his class, plagiarizes a paper Mr. Griffin makes him beg to be allowed back into the class. However, instead of allowing him back in, Mr. Griffin decides to make him repeat the class next semester. Fellow students in the class include David Ruggles, Jeff Garrett, Betsy Cline, and Susan McConnell. Mark suggests kidnapping Mr. Griffin, and convinces David, Jeff, and Betsy to join in on the plan as a way of scaring him and getting revenge because they <b>feel</b> <b>he</b> has treated them poorly.|$|E
5|$|Harding's Socialist {{opponent}} in the 1920 election, Eugene Debs, was serving a ten-year sentence in the Atlanta Penitentiary for speaking against the war. Wilson had refused to pardon him before leaving office. Daugherty met with Debs, and was deeply impressed. There was opposition from veterans, including the American Legion, and also from Florence Harding. The president did not <b>feel</b> <b>he</b> could release Debs until the war was officially over, but once the peace treaties were signed commuted Debs' sentence on December 23, 1921. At Harding's request, Debs visited the president at the White House before going home to Indiana.|$|E
5|$|In 1844, Breckinridge's wife Ann died. Lingering {{sadness and}} {{memories}} of his and Ann's life in Baltimore may have led {{him to leave the}} city and the pastorate he had held for twelve years. He was offered pastorate of the Second Presbyterian Church of Lexington, Kentucky, but instead, accepted the presidency of Jefferson College in Pennsylvania in 1845 against the advice of his brothers John and William. A rift between Breckinridge and his brother Cabell's widow and other relatives may help account for this surprising decision. He did not <b>feel</b> <b>he</b> could yet return to his home state.|$|E

He {{also won the}} Tripoli Grand Prix, organised by the Libyan Governor-General Italo Balbo. The Grand Prix {{was held in the}} desert, around a salt lake, and because of the intense heat Neubauer was concerned that the tyres on the Mercedes-Benz cars would not last. Caracciola started poorly, but moved to third, after four pit stops to change tyres, by lap30 of 40. He inherited the lead from Nuvolari and Varzi when the two Italians pitted, and held it to the finish, despite a late charge from Varzi. Caracciola later wrote that this was the race where he began to <b>feel</b> <b>he</b> had recovered from his crash in Monaco two years before, and he was now back among the contenders.|$|E

He was given a ticker-tape parade in New York City on his return to the US on October 26, 1953, and he was made the Grand Marshal of the Tournament of Roses Parade on January 1, 1954.|$|E
5|$|Zombi 2 {{serves as}} a sequel to Zombi, a re-edited Italian release of George A. Romero's 1978 film Dawn of the Dead; Zombi had been edited by Dario Argento and given a new score by the Italian band Goblin, and proved {{successful}} upon its release in Italy. As Italian copyright law allows any film to be marketed as a sequel to another work, the film was quickly greenlit and financed by producer Fabrizio De Angelis. Enzo G. Castellari was offered to direct Zombi 2, but turned it down as he did not <b>feel</b> <b>he</b> would be the right director for a horror film. Director Lucio Fulci was De Angelis' second choice for the project, and was hired based on his handling of violent scenes in his previous films Sette note in nero and Non si sevizia un paperino.|$|E

5|$|Potter, however, did not <b>feel</b> <b>he</b> fitted {{into this}} {{increasingly}} experimental sound {{the band was}} developing and tended {{to wait until the}} others had worked out their parts during rehearsals, adding his bass lines on top at the last minute. After recording three tracks of their third album, H to He, Who Am the Only One (December 1970), he decided to quit the band. His last gig was on 9 August at the 1970 Plumpton Festival. The remaining members auditioned Dave Anderson, roadie for Brinsley Schwarz and friend of the band, but after a week's rehearsal found that things weren't working out musically. Banton, meanwhile, had become influenced by Vincent Crane's work in Atomic Rooster, where Crane played the bass lines on a Hammond organ's bass pedals and suggested that he could do this as well. With just days to go before the next gig, they tried rehearsing as a four-piece, and it was successful. Banton later played bass guitar on certain songs, having already learned the instrument in the mid-1960s, and Hammill expanded his instrumental capabilities on stage to cover piano and keyboards as well as guitar. Jackson modified his saxophones to be completely electric, as opposed to simply being amplified through a microphone, and combined the sound with a wah-wah pedal and an octave divider.|$|E
5|$|Sainsbury's scores dipped {{again for}} Somerset in 1888; his highest total {{for the county}} was an unbeaten 42 against the MCC. In contrast, in a match played for the MCC, Sainsbury struck his highest total for the side, scoring 180runs against Wiltshire at Lord's. Somerset were rated as {{the best of the}} second-class {{counties}} in both 1887 and 1888, but at the club's annual general meeting, a long discussion took place regarding the captaincy of the club. Sainsbury was unable to be present for the meeting, but had sent a letter advising that if he was removed as captain, he did not <b>feel</b> <b>he</b> could play for the county any more. His letter was not well received at the meeting, and it was decided to replace him as captain with another player who lived closer to Taunton, and was able to play more of the county matches, as Sainsbury had missed a number during 1888. Roe was selected as his replacement, with Hewett as vice-captain. A vote of thanks was given to Sainsbury for his service to the county club.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, {{straight}} {{after finishing}} Cold Feet, Bathurst went straight into filming My Dad's the Prime Minister, a series {{in which he}} portrays fictional British prime minister Michael Philips. The first series was broadcast in a Sunday afternoon CBBC slot in 2003. He watched debates in the House of Commons {{to prepare for the}} role but did not base his portrayal on Tony Blair. In 2003, he returned to theatre {{for the first time in}} four years to play Vershinin in The Three Sisters, opposite Kristin Scott Thomas and Eric Sykes. He had not seen The Three Sisters before starring in it. Director Michael Blakemore advised him to turn this to his advantage, as he would not <b>feel</b> <b>he</b> had to live up to previous portrayals. After its run concluded, a special edition of The Three Sisters was filmed with the same cast for television broadcast on BBC Four. In 2005, the second series of My Dad's the Prime Minister was broadcast, now moved to a Friday night time slot to take advantage of the adult humour. The same year, he starred in the ITV thriller The Stepfather playing Christopher Veazey, a man whose daughter goes missing. Bathurst was pleased that this white-collar worker had an emotional side, in comparison to David Marsden, whom he used as a yardstick when accepting those sorts of roles. Also in 2005, he played Mr Sesseman in an adaptation of Heidi and Dottore Massimo in The Thief Lord.|$|E

25|$|Miller {{said that}} he did not <b>feel</b> <b>he</b> had to top himself in terms of {{production}} design compared to the previous films in the series. Instead, he wanted the production design to harken back to the earlier films and reflect the changes of the past 30 years. Colin Gibson, the production designer, said that they developed an internally consistent history to explain the film's look and justify its use of hot rods. Gibson designed the film's vehicles, all of which are fully functional. Construction of some of the vehicles began as early as 2003. The cars were designed to show characterisation and detail in the world, including the characters' feelings of guilt, loss, and their attempts to recycle the remains of civilisation. Both the Doof Wagon and the Doof Warrior's guitar are fully functional – none of his scenes were rendered in CGI.|$|E
25|$|In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), {{the largest}} Latter Day Saint denomination, the Melchizedek priesthood {{is one of}} two {{governing}} priesthoods, which is typically given {{as a matter of course}} to worthy male members 18 years and older. No exact rule exists about how much time a man must be a member first; he may receive this priesthood as soon as local church leaders <b>feel</b> <b>he</b> is prepared. Ordination is based on the recipient's age and worthiness and does not require any specific training or aptitude. A candidate for this ordination is interviewed and often counseled to study the 84th, 107th, and 121st sections of the Doctrine and Covenants to begin to understand the oath and covenant of the priesthood, the covenant a person makes with God when he receives the Melchizedek priesthood. The candidate is also usually asked to stand in a gathering of the members of the church to be publicly accepted as being worthy of ordination. For male Latter-day Saints, receiving the Melchizedek priesthood is considered to be a saving ordinance of the gospel.|$|E
