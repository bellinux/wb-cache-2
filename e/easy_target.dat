5|$|At {{the time}} of the invading army's entry into Laconia, Sparta was only lightly defended. The {{majority}} of the Spartan army had accompanied Areus on campaign in Crete, where the Lacedaimonians were supporting the polis of Gortyn. As such, Sparta must have seemed like an <b>easy</b> <b>target</b> to Pyrrhus. Arriving outside Sparta in the evening, Cleonymus advised Pyrrhus to attack immediately {{to take advantage of the}} dearth of defenders. Pyrrhus decided against launching an immediate offensive as he feared the destruction that would be wrought by his Gallic soldiers if they were to enter the city at night. Anticipating no resistance, Pyrrhus order his army to make camp and prepared to enter Sparta in the morning.|$|E

These animals are well-adapted {{to exist in}} their desert habitat, as they can live without water {{for long periods of}} time. Addax form herds of five to 20 members, consisting of both males and females. They are led by the oldest female. Due to its slow movements, the antelope is an <b>easy</b> <b>target</b> for its predators: lions, humans, African wild dogs, cheetahs, and leopards. Breeding season is at its peak during winter and early spring. The natural habitat of the addax are arid regions, semideserts and sandy and stony deserts.|$|E
5|$|Simeon often {{violated}} {{the peace treaty}} with Byzantium, attacking and conquering Byzantine territory on several occasions, such as in 904, when the Bulgarian raids were used by Arabs led by the Byzantine renegade Leo of Tripoli to undertake a maritime campaign and seize Thessaloniki. After the Arabs plundered the city, it was an <b>easy</b> <b>target</b> for Bulgaria and the nearby Slavic tribes. In order to dissuade Simeon from capturing the city and populating it with Slavs, Leo VI was forced to make further territorial concessions to the Bulgarians in the modern region of Macedonia. With the treaty of 904, all Slavic-inhabited lands in modern southern Macedonia and southern Albania were ceded to the Bulgarian Empire, with the border line running some 20 kilometres north of Thessaloniki.|$|E

5|$|At 23:56, {{the convoy}} passed south of Zembra Island towards Kelibia on Cap Bon, {{to avoid the}} minefields between Africa and Sicily, still out of formation. Three {{minesweeping}} destroyers sailed ahead, followed by the cruisers Kenya, Manchester and two freighters. Charybdis and the destroyers Eskimo and Somali from Force Z were still some hours behind and Ashanti was steaming fast to overhaul the main body. Three destroyers remained with nine of the merchantmen and Bramham was en route after Deucalion had been sunk. The {{main part of the}} convoy was attacked at 00:40 by four boats of the German III Squadron and 13 torpedo boats of the Italian 18° MAS, 2° MS and 20° MAS, which made fifteen attacks; the long line of merchant ships and the reduced number of escort ships providing an <b>easy</b> <b>target.</b> The 18° MAS detected the convoy on radar, south-east of Pantellaria and attacked the escorts {{at the head of the}} procession, coming under fire as they fired torpedoes to no effect. The Italian boats then attacked the merchant ships.|$|E
5|$|Once Pope struck, Cibber {{became an}} <b>easy</b> <b>target</b> for other satirists. He was {{attacked}} as {{the epitome of}} morally and aesthetically bad writing, largely {{for the sins of}} his autobiography. In the Apology, Cibber speaks daringly in the first person and in his own praise. Although the major figures of the day were jealous of their fame, self-promotion of such an overt sort was shocking, and Cibber offended Christian humility as well as gentlemanly modesty. Additionally, Cibber consistently fails to see fault in his own character, praises his vices, and makes no apology for his misdeeds; so it was not merely the fact of the autobiography, but the manner of it that shocked contemporaries. His diffuse and chatty writing style, conventional in poetry and sometimes incoherent in prose, was bound to look even worse in contrast to stylists like Pope. Henry Fielding satirically tried Cibber for murder of the English language in the 17 May 1740 issue of The Champion. The Tory wits were altogether so successful in their satire of Cibber that the historical image of the man himself was almost obliterated, and it was as the King of Dunces that he came down to posterity.|$|E
