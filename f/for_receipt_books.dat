Among the problems that prompted the creation of the Expert Tailor are the monitoring of merchandise inventory and customer profiles, <b>book</b> keeping <b>for</b> <b>receipts</b> and orders, and customer follow ups and notifications. Tailoring business involves a lot of data keeping, and with huge orders, the chances of loosing them are high. Expert Tailor was developed by using Preprocessor Hypertext Programming (PHP) and MySQL for the database. There are a few modules in Expert Tailor such as booking module, customer profile, merchandise inventory, booking receipts and a short message system (SMS) to the customer. The system was developed to meet the needs of premises and to help independent tailor or seamstress to manage their business better. Expert Tailor combined conventional work style into a computer visual form to ensure systematic, effective, smooth and safe work progress.

A juxtaposition of three types of primary sources allows for a comparative evaluation of gender roles, utilizing male-published guidebooks and treatises on proper female behavior, multimedia popular culture sources featuring the housewife trope, and the handwritten <b>receipt</b> <b>books</b> and letters of the newly-literate housewife herself to fully illuminate the figure of the woman in the kitchen.

The European State Finance Database (ESFD) is an international collaborative research project for the collection of data in European fiscal history. There are no strict geographical or chronological boundaries to the collection, although data for this collection comprise the period between c. 1200 to c. 1815. The purpose of the ESFD was to establish a significant database of European financial and fiscal records. The data are drawn from the main extant sources {{of a number of}} European countries, as the evidence and the state of scholarship permit. The aim was to collect the data made available by scholars, whether drawing upon their published or unpublished archival research, or from other published material. The ESFD project at the University of Leicester serves also to assist scholars working with the data by providing statistical manipulations of data and high quality graphical outputs for publication. The broad aim of the project was to act as a facilitator for a general methodological and statistical advance in the area of European fiscal history, with data capture and the interpretation of data in key publications as the measurable indicators of that advance. The data were originally deposited at the UK Data Archive in SAS transport format and as ASCII files; however, data files in this new edition have been saved as tab delimited files. Furthermore, this new edition features documentation {{in the form of a}} single file containing essential data file metadata, source details and notes of interest for particular files. Main Topics : This dataset contains data on seventeenth-century French revenues and expenditure, drawing upon J-R Malet.
