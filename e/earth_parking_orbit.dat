25|$|Luna 17 was {{launched}} on November 10, 1970 at 14:44:01 UTC. After reaching <b>Earth</b> <b>parking</b> <b>orbit,</b> {{the final stage}} of Luna 17s launching rocket fired to place it into a trajectory towards the Moon (November 10, 1970 at 14:54 UTC). After two course correction manoeuvres (on November 12 and 14) it entered lunar orbit on November 15, 1970 at 22:00 UTC.|$|E
25|$|The Mars 1M {{programs}} (sometimes dubbed Marsnik in Western media) was {{the first}} Soviet unmanned spacecraft interplanetary exploration program, which consisted of two flyby probes launched towards Mars in October 1960, Mars 1960A and Mars 1960B (also known as Korabl 4 and Korabl 5 respectively). After launch, the third stage pumps on both launchers were unable to develop enough pressure to commence ignition, so <b>Earth</b> <b>parking</b> <b>orbit</b> was not achieved. The spacecraft reached an altitude of 120km before reentry.|$|E
25|$|On April 11, 1970, Flight Director Gene Kranz {{gives the}} go-ahead from Houston's Mission Control Center for the Apollo 13 launch. As the Saturn V rocket climbs through the atmosphere, a second stage engine cuts off prematurely, but the craft reaches its <b>Earth</b> <b>parking</b> <b>orbit.</b> After {{the third stage}} fires to send Apollo 13 to the Moon, Swigert {{performs}} the maneuver to connect the Command/Service Module Odyssey to the Lunar Module Aquarius and pull {{it away from the}} spent rocket.|$|E
40|$|A simple {{strategy}} is identified to generate ballistic transfers between the Earth and Moon, i. e., transfers that perform two maneuvers: a trans-lunar injection maneuver to depart the Earth and a Lunar Orbit Insertion maneuver to insert into orbit at the Moon. This {{strategy is}} used to survey the performance of numerous transfers between varying <b>Earth</b> <b>parking</b> <b>orbits</b> and varying low lunar target orbits. The transfers surveyed include short 3 - 6 day direct transfers, longer 3 - 4 month low energy transfers, and variants that include Earth phasing orbits and/or lunar flybys...|$|R
40|$|Space reactor {{power systems}} with {{characteristics}} ideal for advanced spacecraft systems applications are discussed. These characteristics are: high power-to-weight ratio (15 to 33 W/kg); high volume density (high ballistic coefficient); no preferential orientation in orbit; long operational life; high reliability; and total launch and operational safety. These characteristics allow {{the use of}} electric propulsion to raise spacecraft from low <b>earth</b> <b>parking</b> <b>orbits</b> to operational orbits, greatly increasing the useful orbit payload for a given launch vehicle by {{eliminating the need for}} a separation injection stage. A proposed demonstration mission is described...|$|R
40|$|Near-optimal three {{dimensional}} trajectories {{from a low}} <b>earth</b> <b>park</b> <b>orbit</b> inclined at 28. 5 deg to a synchronous-equatorial mission orbit {{were developed}} for both the storable (thrust = 28, 912 N (6, 500 lbs), I sub sp = 339 sec) and cryogenic (thrust = 44, 480 N (10, 000 lbs), I sub sp = 470 sec) space tug using the iterative cost function minimization technique contained within the modularized vehicle simulation (MVS) program. The finite burn times, due to low thrust-to-weight ratios, and the associated gravity losses are accounted for in the trajectory simulation and optimization. The use of an ascent phasing orbit to achieve burnout in synchronous orbit at any longitude is investigated. The ascent phasing orbit is found to offer the additional advantage of significantly reducing the overall delta velocity by splitting the low altitude burn into two parts and thereby reducing gravity losses...|$|R
25|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{was launched}} on June 2, 2003 at 23:45 local time (17:45 UT, 1:45p.m. EDT) from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, using a Soyuz-FG/Fregat rocket. The Mars Express and Fregat booster were initially {{put into a}} 200km <b>Earth</b> <b>parking</b> <b>orbit,</b> then the Fregat was fired again at 19:14 UT to put the spacecraft into a Mars transfer orbit. The Fregat and Mars Express separated at approximately 19:17 UT. The solar panels were then deployed and a trajectory correction manoeuvre was performed on June 4 to aim Mars Express towards Mars and allow the Fregat booster to coast into interplanetary space. The Mars Express was the first Russian-launched probe to successfully {{make it out of}} LEO since the Soviet Union fell.|$|E
2500|$|Lunokhod 2 (vehicle 8ЕЛ№204) was {{the second}} and more {{advanced}} of the two unmanned lunar rovers landed on the Moon by the Soviet Union {{as part of the}} Lunokhod program. The launcher put the spacecraft into <b>Earth</b> <b>parking</b> <b>orbit</b> on January 8, 1973, followed by a translunar injection. On January 12, 1973, Luna 21 was braked into a [...] lunar orbit.|$|E
50|$|However, {{retrorockets}} {{were used}} to back the S-IC and S-II stages off after their respective shutdowns during the rocket's journey from the launch pad at the Kennedy Space Center to <b>Earth</b> <b>Parking</b> <b>Orbit.</b>|$|E
40|$|Three {{separate}} and distinct modes of using the space shuttle system have been identified. These modes include the boost of a spacecraft plus one or more propulsion stages into <b>earth</b> <b>orbit</b> or <b>parking</b> <b>orbit,</b> the establishment and maintenance of automated observatories in space, {{and the support of}} exploratory research and instrument development. Studies show that approximately 60 % of all planned NASA missions require a shuttle third stage. Illustrations are presented to show how the largest spacecraft, Viking, and its propulsion system, Centaur, and a communications satellite, with an Agena stage to place it into a geostationary orbit, would fit into the shuttle. Results of the NASA Shuttle Sortie Workshop studies are discussed together with prospects of European cooperation in future workshop experiments...|$|R
40|$|The planar, circular, {{restricted}} three-body problem {{predicts the}} existence of periodic orbits around the Lagrangian equilibrium point L 1. Considering the Earth-lunar-probe system, some of these orbits pass {{very close to the}} surfaces of the Earth and the Moon. These characteristics make it possible for these orbits, in spite of their instability, to be used in transfer maneuvers between <b>Earth</b> and lunar <b>parking</b> <b>orbits.</b> The main goal {{of this paper is to}} explore this scenario, adopting a more complex and realistic dynamical system, the four-body problem Sun-Earth-Moon-probe. We defined and investigated a set of paths, derived from the orbits around L 1, which are capable of achieving transfer between low-altitude Earth (LEO) and lunar orbits, including high-inclination lunar orbits, at a low cost and with flight time between 13 and 15 days. </p...|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the AS-203 flight was to {{investigate}} the effects of weightlessness on the liquid hydrogen fuel in the S-IVB-200 second-stage tank. The lunar missions would use {{a modified version of the}} S-IVB-200, the S-IVB-500, as the third stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle. This called for the stage to fire briefly to put the spacecraft into a <b>parking</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbit,</b> before restarting the engine for flight to the Moon. In order to design this capability, engineers needed to verify that the anti-slosh measures designed to control the hydrogen's location in the tank were adequate, and that the fuel lines and engines could be kept at the proper temperatures to allow engine restart.|$|R
50|$|The Ranger 1 {{spacecraft}} {{was designed}} to go into an <b>Earth</b> <b>parking</b> <b>orbit</b> and then move into a 60000 by 1100000 km Earth orbit. The purpose of the mission was mainly as an engineering test to verify the functionality of the Ranger hardware.|$|E
50|$|The Proton-K/D {{launcher}} put {{the spacecraft}} into <b>Earth</b> <b>parking</b> <b>orbit</b> followed by translunar injection. On January 12, 1973 Luna 21 was braked into a 90 by 100 km (56 by 62 mile) lunar orbit. On January 13 and 14, the perilune was lowered to 16 km altitude.|$|E
5000|$|Venera 6 was {{launched}} into an <b>Earth</b> <b>parking</b> <b>orbit</b> on 10 January 1969 at 05:51:52 UT {{and then from}} a Tyazheliy Sputnik (69-002C) towards Venus. After a mid-course maneuver on 16 March the Venera 6 probe was released on 17 May 1969, 25,000 km from the planet.|$|E
50|$|The {{launch window}} for Venus Express was open from 26 October to 23 November 2005, with the launch {{initially}} set for 26 October 4:43 UTC. However, {{problems with the}} insulation from the Fregat upper stage led to a two-week launch delay to inspect and clear out the small insulation debris that migrated on the spacecraft. It was eventually launched by a Soyuz-FG/Fregat rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 9 November 2005 at 03:33:34 UTC into a <b>parking</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbit</b> and 1 h 36 min after launch put into its transfer orbit to Venus. A first trajectory correction maneuver was successfully performed on 11 November 2005. It arrived at Venus on 11 April 2006, after 153 days of journey, and fired its main engine between 07:10:29 and 08:00:42 UTC SCET to reduce its velocity {{so that it could}} be captured by Venusian gravity into a nine-day orbit of 400 by 330000 km. The burn was monitored from ESA's Control Centre, ESOC, in Darmstadt, Germany.|$|R
40|$|Earth-departure {{windows are}} {{investigated}} for two round trip stopover missions to Mars. These are the 1981 inbound Venus swingby mission and the 1986 direct minimum-energy mission.

50|$|A <b>parking</b> <b>orbit</b> is a {{temporary}} orbit used during the launch of a satellite or other space probe. A launch vehicle boosts into the <b>parking</b> <b>orbit,</b> then coasts for a while, then fires again to enter the final desired trajectory. The alternative to a <b>parking</b> <b>orbit</b> is direct injection, where the rocket fires continuously (except during staging) until its fuel is exhausted, ending with the payload on the final trajectory.|$|R
50|$|Luna 5 was {{launched}} by a Molniya-M carrier rocket, flying from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Liftoff occurred at 07:49:37 UTC on 9 May 1965. The spacecraft and Blok L upper stage entered a low <b>Earth</b> <b>parking</b> <b>orbit,</b> before the Blok L fired to propel Luna 5 towards the Moon.|$|E
50|$|At launch, the Lunar Module sat {{directly}} {{beneath the}} Command/Service Module (CSM) with legs folded, inside the Spacecraft-to-LM Adapter (SLA) {{attached to the}} S-IVB third stage of the Saturn V rocket. There it remained through <b>earth</b> <b>parking</b> <b>orbit</b> and the Trans Lunar Injection (TLI) rocket burn to send the craft toward the Moon.|$|E
50|$|Luna 19 was {{launched}} into an <b>earth</b> <b>parking</b> <b>orbit</b> on 28 September, and, from this orbit, was sent toward the Moon. Luna 19 entered an {{orbit around the}} Moon on 2 October 1971 after two midcourse corrections on 29 September and 1 October. Initial orbital parameters were 140 x 140 kilometers at 40.58° inclination.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} a Mars <b>parking</b> <b>orbit</b> optimization effort. This <b>parking</b> <b>orbit</b> study {{includes the}} selection of optimal elliptic Mars <b>parking</b> <b>orbits</b> that meet mission constraints and that include pertinent apsidal misalignment losses. Mars missions examined are for the opportunity years of 2014, 2016, and 2018. For these mission opportunities, it is shown that the optimal <b>parking</b> <b>orbits</b> depend on the year that the mission occurs and are coupled with the outbound, Mars stay, and return phases of the mission. Constraints included in the <b>parking</b> <b>orbit</b> optimization process are periapsis lighting angle (related to a daylight landing requirement), periapsis latitude (related to a landing latitude range requirement) and the vehicle Trans-Earth-Injection stage mass. Also, effects of mission abort requirements on optimal <b>parking</b> <b>orbits</b> are investigated. Off-periapsis maneuvers for Mars orbit capture {{were found to be}} cost effective in reducing the mission delta-V for the 2016 abort from Mars capture scenario. The total capture and departure delta-V was `split' between the capture maneuver and the departure maneuver to reduce the 2016 Mars departure delta-V to below the level of the corresponding stage of the 2014 baseline mission. Landing results are provided that show Mars landing site access from the optimal elliptic <b>parking</b> <b>orbits</b> for Mars excursion vehicles with low (0. 2) and high (1. 3 and 1. 6) lift to drag ratio...|$|R
40|$|An actual {{geosynchronous}} {{earth orbit}}-to-low earth orbit (GEO-to-LEO) transfer is considered {{with reference to}} the aeroassisted flight experiment (AFE) spacecraft, and optimal trajectories are determined by minimizing the total characteristic velocity. The optimization is performed with respect to the time history of the controls (angle of attack and angle of bank), the entry path inclination and the flight time being free. Two transfer maneuvers are considered: direct ascent (DA) to LEO and indirect ascent (IA) to LEO via <b>parking</b> <b>earth</b> <b>orbit</b> (PEO). By taking into account certain assumptions, the complete system can be decoupled into two subsystems: one describing the longitudinal motion and one describing the lateral motion. The angle of attack history, the entry path inclination, and the flight time are determined via the longitudinal motion subsystem. In this subsystem, the difference between the instantaneous bank angle and a constant bank angle is minimized in the least square sense subject to the specified orbital inclination requirement. Both the angles of attack and the angle of bank are shown to be constant. This result has considerable importance in the design of nominal trajectories {{to be used in the}} guidance of AFE and aeroassisted orbital transfer (AOT) vehicles...|$|R
2500|$|Due to {{the less}} than nominal launch, the CSM and S-IVB were {{inserted}} into a [...] by [...] <b>parking</b> <b>orbit,</b> instead of the planned [...] circular orbit. Then, after the standard two <b>parking</b> <b>orbits</b> {{to check out the}} vehicle's readiness for Trans Lunar Injection (TLI), the S-IVB failed to restart.|$|R
50|$|Luna 6 was {{launched}} by a Molniya-M carrier rocket flying from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Liftoff occurred at 07:40 UTC on 8 June 1965, with the spacecraft and Blok L upper stage entering a low <b>Earth</b> <b>parking</b> <b>orbit,</b> before the upper stage propelled the spacecraft into a heliocentric orbit passing the Moon.|$|E

50|$|Mars 4 was {{launched}} by a Proton-K carrier rocket, a Blok D upper stage, flying from Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 81/23. The launch occurred at 19:30:59 UTC on 21 July 1973, {{with the first}} three stages placing the spacecraft and upper stage into a low <b>Earth</b> <b>parking</b> <b>orbit</b> before the Blok D fired to propel Mars 4 into heliocentric orbit bound for Mars.|$|E
40|$|A {{roundtrip}} Mars mission presents {{many challenges}} {{to the design of}} a transportation system and requires a series of orbital maneuvers within Mars vicinity to capture, reorient, and then return the spacecraft back to Earth. The selection of a Mars <b>parking</b> <b>orbit</b> is crucial to the mission design; not only can the parking or-bit choice drastically impact the V requirements of these maneuvers but also it must be properly aligned to target desired surface or orbital destinations. This paper presents a method that can optimize the Mars <b>parking</b> <b>orbits</b> given the arrival and departure conditions from heliocentric trajectories, and it can also en-force constraints on the <b>parking</b> <b>orbits</b> to satisfy other architecture design requirements such as co-planar subperiapsis descent to planned landing sites, due east or co-planar ascent back to the <b>parking</b> <b>orbit,</b> or low cost transfers to and from Phobos and Deimos...|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} reasons why a <b>parking</b> <b>orbit</b> may be used.|$|R
50|$|For {{launches}} above low Earth orbit (LEO), {{the actual}} launch {{time can be}} somewhat flexible if a <b>parking</b> <b>orbit</b> is used, because the inclination and time the spacecraft initially spends in the <b>parking</b> <b>orbit</b> can be varied.

50|$|Apollo lunar {{missions}} {{would begin}} with a nominal 100 nmi km circular <b>Earth</b> <b>parking</b> <b>orbit.</b> Apollo 8 was launched into an initial orbit with an apogee of 99.99 nmi km and a perigee of 99.57 nmi km, with an inclination of 32.51° to the Equator, and an orbital period of 88.19 minutes. Propellant venting increased the apogee by 6.4 nmi km over the 2 hours, 44 minutes and 30 seconds spent in the parking orbit.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the less}} than nominal launch, the CSM and S-IVB were {{inserted}} into a 93.49 nmi km by 194.44 nmi km <b>parking</b> <b>orbit,</b> instead of the planned 100 nmi km circular orbit. Then, after the standard two <b>parking</b> <b>orbits</b> {{to check out the}} vehicle's readiness for Trans Lunar Injection (TLI), the S-IVB failed to restart.|$|R
50|$|The Ariane 5 {{does not}} use <b>parking</b> <b>orbits.</b> This {{simplifies}} the launcher since multiple restart is not needed, and the penalty is small for their typical GTO mission, as their launch site {{is close to the}} equator. An upgrade to the second stage (ESC-B) will have multiple restart capability, so future missions may use <b>parking</b> <b>orbits.</b>|$|R
40|$|Future lunar {{missions}} {{will involve}} long stay times in orbit about the moon.

The development of a simplified gravitational model with sufficient accuracy is necessary to investigate orbital lifetimes for the large number of orbital parameters possible. Utilization of a simplified model will significantly reduce the required computational time needed to perform this analysis. By investigating the effects of the lunar gravity model on the various <b>parking</b> <b>orbits,</b> the parameters which are important in determining lifetime predictions are identified...|$|R
