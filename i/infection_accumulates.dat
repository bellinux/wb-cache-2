40|$|Influenza virus {{particles}} are assembled at the plasma membrane {{in concert with}} incorporation of the virus genome, but the details of its spatio-temporal regulation are not understood. Here we showed that influenza virus infection induces the assembly of pericentrosomal endocytic recycling compartment (ERC) through the activation of Rab 11 a GTPase and cell cycle-independent maturation of centrosome by YB- 1, a multifunctional protein that is involved in mitotic division, RNA metabolism and tumorigenesis. YB- 1 is recruited to the centrosome in infected cells and is required for anchoring microtubules to the centrosome. We also found that viral <b>infection</b> <b>accumulates</b> cholesterol in ERC and is dependent on YB- 1. Depletion of YB- 1 shows reduced cholesterol-enriched ERC and prevented budozone formation at the plasma membrane. These results suggest that cholesterol in recycling endosomes, which are emanated from ERC, may trigger the virus assembly concomitantly with the packaging of the virus genome. We propose that the virus genome is transported to the plasma membrane by cholesterol-enriched recycling endosomes through cell cycle-independent activation of the centrosome by YB- 1...|$|E

Expression of PiAVR 2 in a virulent P. infestans isolate conveys a gain-of-avirulence phenotype, indicating that this is a dominant gene triggering R 2 -dependent disease resistance. PiAVR 2 presence/absence polymorphisms and differential transcription explain virulence on R 2 plants. Isolates infecting R 2 plants express PiAVR 2 -like, which evades recognition by R 2. PiAVR 2 and PiAVR 2 -like differ in 13 amino acids, eight of which are in the C-terminal effector domain; {{one or more of these}} determines recognition by R 2. Nevertheless, few polymorphisms were observed within each gene in pathogen isolates, suggesting limited selection pressure for change within PiAVR 2 and PiAVR 2 -like. # • Our results direct a search for R genes recognizing PiAVR 2 -like, which, deployed with R 2, may exert strong selection pressure against the P. infestans population...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe US 11 gene of {{herpes simplex}} virus 1 maps in the unique {{sequences}} of the short component of the HSV- 1 (F) genome approximately 775 bp {{from the center of}} the DNA replication origin (OriS) and encodes a virion protein which binds RNA in sequence- and conformation-specific fashion, negatively regulates the accumulation of a prematurely terminated transcript of UL 34, associates in the infected cell with the 60 S ribosomal subunit, and, late in <b>infection,</b> <b>accumulates</b> in nucleoli. We report the following: (i) Deletion of a 222 -bp sequence including OriS (ΔOriS) negatively affected the accumulation of the US 11 protein without decreasing the accumulation of the US 11 transcript. (ii) The defect, observed at all times after infection, was multiplicity independent, was unrelated to US 11 protein stability, and apparently resulted from a cis-acting element since a coinfecting virus was unable to complement the ΔOriS virus. (iii) Transcription from the US 11 promoter initiated from three sites on the ΔOriS virus. Transcripts initiated from two of the three initation sites accumulated similarly in cells infected with the ΔOriS virus or wild-type parent virus. The low-abundance transcript initiating from the third site was apparently unique to the ΔOriS virus but was not expected to alter the coding capacity of the mRNA. (iv) Infected cells accumulated RNA derived by antisense transcription of the genome domain containing the US 11 gene.

Encapsidated RNAs 1 and 2 are covalently linked to a 3138 Da VPg encoded by the RNA of PEMV- 1. To determine {{the role of the}} VPg in the pathogenicity of PEMV (PEMV- 1 MPEMV- 2), the infectivity of clones with mutations in key amino acids in the VPg was evaluated in protoplasts and in plants.

Moreover, we define a novel signaling pathway activated during Shigella entry that links Abl kinase phosphorylation of Crk to activation of the Rho family GTPases Rac and Cdc 42.

40|$|Core genes {{comprising}} the ubiquitous backbone of bacterial genomes {{are not subject}} to frequent horizontal transfer and generally are not thought to contribute to the adaptive evolution of bacterial pathogens. We determined, however, that at least one-third and possibly more than one-half of the core genes in Escherichia coli genomes are targeted by repeated replacement substitutions in the same amino acid positions—hotspot mutations. Occurrence of hotspot mutations is driven by positive selection, as their rate is significantly higher than expected by random chance alone, and neither intragenic recombination nor increased mutability can explain the observed patterns. Also, commensal E. coli strains have a significantly lower frequency of mutated genes and mutations per genome than pathogenic strains. E. coli strains causing extra-intestinal <b>infections</b> <b>accumulate</b> hotspot mutations at the highest rate, whereas the highest total number of mutated genes has been found among Shigella isolates, suggesting the pathoadaptive nature of such mutations.

From the available evidence, more severe recurrence results from repeated bolus corticosteroid therapy and anti-lymphocyte antibodies used to treat rejection.

SepZ is hypervariable among A/E pathogens, with sequences sharing between 60 to 81 % amino acid identity with SepZ of EPEC. A SepZ-CyaA fusion was secreted and translocated into HeLa cells in a TTSS-dependent manner.

The HCV resistance field is not yet as advanced as the HIV field, for which numerous resistance interpretation resources exist, including the well-known IAS-USA resistance mutation table 3 and the Stanford HIV Resistance database. 4 For HCV, initial clinical information is emerging and this publication is meant to provide current state-of-the-art information with respect to drug resistance. 5,...|$|R
50|$|The holes {{caused by}} S105 {{have an average}} {{diameter}} of 340 nm, and some exceeding 1 micron. Most cells exhibit only one irregular hole, randomly positioned in the membrane, irrespective of its size. During λ <b>infection,</b> S105 <b>accumulates</b> harmlessly in the membrane until it forms a single irregular hole, releasing the endolysin from the cytoplasm, resulting in lysis within seconds. Using a functional S105-GFP fusion, it was demonstrated that the protein accumulates uniformly in the membrane, and then within 1 minute, it forms aggregates {{at the time of}} lethality. Thus, like bacteriorhodopsin, the protein accumulates until it reaches a critical concentration for nucleation.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In 2009, we {{have been}} {{experiencing}} a new pandemic of novel influenza virus type A (H 1 N 1) infection. The human beings still face the threat of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H 5 N 1) virus. Many patients with influenza virus infection have died due to severe complications even though receiving intensive care. This suggests {{the need for new}} treatment strategies of severe influenza-associated complications. In cases of severe influenza-associated complications, pathological manifestations are as a result of complex biological consequences, such as apoptosis induction, macrophage activation, oxidative damage and increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Recent studies have revealed that the pathogenesis of severe influenza-associated complications involves not only the virus replication-mediated apoptotic cell death in the infected cells but also non-infected cell injury by toxicity of reactive oxygen species derived from macro-phages phagocytosing apoptotic cells, and that pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by the virus-infected host cells {{play a critical role in}} the activation of macrophages. These findings provide a possibility that an agent with antiviral and antioxidant activities can be a drug of choice for the treatment of patients with severe influenza-associated complications. Selected antioxidants, such as pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, glutathione, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, thujaplicin and certain types of flavonoids, possess both activities. The combination of antioxidants, such as superoxide dismutase and N-acetyl-L-cysteine, with antiviral drug ribavirin synergistically reduced the lethal effect of influenza virus <b>infection.</b> <b>Accumulating</b> a number of evidence highlights a potential of selected antioxidants for treatment of sever...|$|R
40|$|The helicase-like 1 a and polymerase-like 2 a {{proteins}} of brome mosaic virus (BMV) {{are required}} for viral RNA replication in vivo, are present in membrane-bound viral RNA polymerase extracts, and share conservation with the many {{other members of the}} alphavirus-like superfamily. To better understand BMV RNA replication and BMV-host interactions, we used confocal microscopy and double-label immunofluorescence to determine and compare the sites of 1 a, 2 a, and nascent viral RNA accumulation in BMV-infected barley protoplasts. 1 a and 2 a showed nearly complete colocalization throughout <b>infection,</b> <b>accumulating</b> in defined cytoplasmic spots usually adjacent to or surrounding the nucleus. These spots grew throughout infection and by 16 h postinoculation often assumed a vesicle-like appearance. The BMV RNA replication complex incorporated 5 -bromouridine 5 '-triphosphate into RNA in vitro and in vivo, allowing immunofluorescent detection of nascent RNA. The cytoplasmic sites of BMV-specific RNA synthesis coincided with the sites of 1 a and 2 a accumulation, and at the resolution of confocal microscopy, all sites of 1 a and 2 a accumulation were sites of BMV RNA synthesis. Double-label immunofluorescence detection of selected subcellular markers and 1 a or 2 a showed that BMV replication complexes were tightly associated with markers for the endoplasmic reticulum but not the medial Golgi or later compartments of the cellular secretory pathway. Defining this association of BMV RNA replication complexes with endoplasmic reticulum markers should assist in identifying and characterizing host factors involved in BMV RNA replication...|$|R
