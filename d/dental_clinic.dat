5|$|Originally, Walter Chrysler had {{a two-story}} {{apartment}} on the 69th and 70th floors with a fireplace and a private office. The office also contained a gymnasium and the tallest bathrooms in the world. Chrysler also had a triplex unit on the 58th through 60th floors, which served as his residence. However, Chrysler did not use his gym much, instead choosing {{to stay at the}} Chrysler Corporation's headquarters in Detroit. Later, the 69th and 70th floors were converted into a <b>dental</b> <b>clinic.</b> In 2005, a New York Times report found that one of the dentists, Charles Weiss, had operated at the clinic's current rooftop location since 1969. The office still had the suite's original bathroom and gymnasium.|$|E

40|$|There’s been {{a general}} ban {{on use of}} mercury in Sweden since 2009 but it’s still {{estimated}} that the Swedish population have between 40 – 60 tons of amalgam in their teeth. Dental amalgam contains about 50 % mercury and {{studies have shown that}} despite the installation of amalgam separators mercury emissions from <b>dental</b> <b>clinics</b> still occur. Environmental officers in Swedish municipalities are important in the work to reduce mercury emissions from <b>dental</b> <b>clinics</b> in Sweden. The purpose of this report was to investigate how Swedish municipalities carry out supervision of mercury management in <b>dental</b> <b>clinics</b> as well as to investigate the legislative demands on the mercury management in <b>dental</b> <b>clinics.</b> The purpose was also to investigate possible similarities and differences between municipalities with varying populations. Environmental officers in Swedish municipalities answered a web survey. The results show that the knowledge about mercury management in <b>dental</b> <b>clinics</b> is greater among environmental officers in larger municipalities compared to smaller municipalities. Some of the smaller municipalities don’t carry out any inspections of <b>dental</b> <b>clinics</b> whereas every larger municipality does. Larger municipalities have higher demands on mercury management in <b>dental</b> <b>clinics</b> than smaller municipalities. The legislations used are broadly the same among the municipalities but because the demands made by the municipalities differ, it indicates that the interpretation of the legislations vary between municipalities in Sweden. Collaborations between different municipalities, more distinct guidelines and guidance are probably necessary to achieve a consensus amongst the municipalities when it comes to mercury management in <b>dental</b> <b>clinics...</b>|$|R
40|$|Although {{national}} {{dental care}} expenditure has not changed, {{the number of}} <b>dental</b> <b>clinics</b> has increased. Mass media has been reporting on the financial difficulties of <b>dental</b> <b>clinics.</b> To address this issue, we reviewed articles that showed the distribution and changes in net income, that is, total expenses subtracted from total income, of private <b>dental</b> <b>clinics</b> in Japan using data from a {{survey conducted by the}} Japan Dental Association. We also reviewed articles analyzing the factors relating to the net income. The results of the articles showed that distribution of net income has become positively skewed, with the mean dragged to the right by a few high scores. This means that the median is more appropriate than the mean as a measure of central tendency of net income. Factors relating to net income of private <b>dental</b> <b>clinics</b> have changed: private <b>dental</b> <b>clinics</b> that were opened after 1989 (new) and had dental hygienists, who may conduct dental maintenance, had high net income, suggesting that they are well-managed or having a different type of patient mix in recent years. These analyses provide important and useful information for not only better management of private <b>dental</b> <b>clinics</b> but also policy-making in dental health care...|$|R

Materials and methods: Private <b>dental</b> <b>clinics</b> {{that had been}} {{registered}} with the Ministry of Health (MOH), Health Affairs System and accepted to participate were included. All clinics were visited to collect data. Number of practicing dentists, nationality, and their specialty classification were recorded.

Becoming involved in a counterfeiting scheme, he printed $6 million in U.S. 100-dollar bills, some of which he stored in ice chests buried {{in the back yard}} of a house he owned and rented out. Charged along with five others, he served two-and-a-half years of a five-year sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution, Texarkana. Upon his release in 1986, he regained his dentistry license but struggled to rebuild his practice. In 1995, he was hired as a dentist at the Louisiana State Penitentiary, initially as a contractor.
