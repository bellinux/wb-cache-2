50|$|Dr. Blass’ {{research}} has concentrated on brain metabolism and metabolic {{diseases of the}} brain, particularly diseases affecting the mitochondria and specifically the Krebs tricarboxylic acid cycle. Blass’ interest in this topic began at NIH, where he described the first <b>hereditary</b> <b>defect</b> in a major enzyme of human oxidative/energy metabolism (pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency). Since moving to Cornell, his work concentrated on Alzheimer Disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. He and his coworkers pioneered the finding that inherent abnormalities of mitochondrial components occur in Alzheimer brain and other Alzheimer tissues {{and the implications of}} that finding for the pathophysiology of the dementia. He has also published on clinical aspects of Alzheimer disease and other causes of cognitive impairment.|$|E
5000|$|The idea of {{sterilising}} those carrying <b>hereditary</b> <b>defects</b> or exhibiting {{what was}} thought to be hereditary [...] "antisocial" [...] behaviour was widely accepted.

5000|$|Under normal [...] conditions, {{approximately}} 4% of {{the oxygen}} metabolized by mitochondria {{is converted to}} superoxide ion, which can subsequently be converted to hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical and eventually other reactive species including other peroxides and singlet oxygen, which can, in turn, generate free radicals capable of damaging structural proteins and DNA. Certain metal ions found in the body, such as copper and iron, may participate in the process. (In Wilson's disease, a <b>hereditary</b> <b>defect</b> that causes the body to retain copper, some of the symptoms resemble accelerated senescence.) These processes termed oxidative stress {{are linked to the}} potential benefits of dietary polyphenol antioxidants, for example in coffee, red wine and tea.|$|E
50|$|Legalization of {{abortion}} was first widely discussed in Germany {{during the early}} 20th century. When Germany became a country in 1871, section 218 of the Constitution outlawed abortion, requiring a penal term for both {{the woman and the}} doctor involved. During the Weimar Republic, such discussion led to a reduction in the maximum penalty for abortion, and in 1926 — by a court's decision — to the legalization {{of abortion}} in cases of grave danger {{to the life of the}} mother. Nazi Germany's eugenics laws liberalized abortion for both Aryan and non-Aryan women. Aryan women could obtain an abortion simply by demonstrating that either parent had an <b>hereditary</b> <b>defect</b> or that the child would be born with a congenital defect. Non-Aryan women were encouraged to contracept and abort, in order to reduce their population.|$|E
40|$|Immuno-enzyme cytochemical {{investigations}} have shown that, (1) the hypothalamic supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the Brattleboro rat, {{as in the}} normal rat, contain separate neurons which produce oxytocin + neurophysin; (2) the hereditary inability of the Brattleboro rat to synthesize vasopressin and its associated neurophysin {{is due to a}} biochemical defect of separate "neurophysin-vasopressin" neurons in the supraoptic and the paraventricular nuclei. These observations strongly support the hypotheses that (1) vasopressin and its associated neurophysin are formed via a common precursor, and (2) the initial point of intracellular appearance of the <b>hereditary</b> <b>defect</b> in the Brattleboro rat lies in the synthesis of this precursor, which occurs on ribosomes. Moreover, observations have demonstrated that, in the Brattleboro rat, in addition to the hereditary inability of the hypothalamic magnocellular neurosecretory system to synthesize vasopressin, there also exists a similar <b>hereditary</b> <b>defect</b> in the hypothetical parvicellular suprachiasmatic-median eminence neurosecretory system. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|SummarySingle murine {{and human}} {{intestinal}} stem cells can be expanded in culture over long time periods as genetically and phenotypically stable epithelial organoids.

Here we use the CRISPR/Cas 9 genome editing system to correct the CFTR locus by homologous recombination in cultured intestinal stem cells of CF patients.

40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of aneurysm formation was {{studied in}} Blotchy (Blo) mice {{which have a}} <b>hereditary</b> <b>defect</b> in collagen and elastin cross-linking.

More advanced lesions were characterized by infiltrates of inflammatory cells, hemorrhages, and eventual ruptures of the aortic wall. Accumulations of lipids, Schiff-positive mucopolysaccharides, iron or calcium were not found. The lesions occurred primarily at points of greatest stress and were confined to the thoracic aorta. Androgen-insensitive mice (Tfm/Y) with the Blo gene died at a significantly earlier age than did normal Blo males or Blo/plus females. The Blo mouse is compared with other animal models of spontaneous and experimentally produced aneurysms...|$|E
40|$|The health {{problems}} of pedigree dogs are {{mainly caused by}} selective breeding of dogs for human needs and aesthetics. Selective breeding can cause an increase of harmful breed characteristics and <b>hereditary</b> <b>defects.</b> This may harm {{the well-being of the}} animals. This study contributes to the project ‘Rashondengids’ of the LICG (Landelijk Informatie Centrum Gezelschapsdieren, Dutch independent foundation which provides information about companion animals), started in 2014. The aim of this project is to develop a pedigree dog guide. The purpose of this guide is to inform future dog owners in an accessible and scientific way about the different dog breeds and its harmful breed characteristics and <b>hereditary</b> <b>defects.</b> The information refers to the Dutch population of dogs. For this purpose, qualitative data were collected by performing a literature study and by researching the clinical database of the UKG (Universiteitskliniek voor Gezelschapsdieren, University clinic of companion animals). In another following study, quantitative data will be collected also. These results will be combined to provide the (future) dog owner a complete and reliable overview of the diseases occurring in different dog breeds. This study has its focus on four dog breeds: Border Collie, Bouvier des Flandres, Dachshund, and Schapendoes. The research question of this study is the following: “To what extent occur harmful breed characteristics and <b>hereditary</b> <b>defects</b> in the populations of the Border Collie, Bouvier des Flandres, Dachshund and Schapendoes in the Netherlands?” The most important disorders in the Border Collie are: idiopathic epilepsy and ivermectin sensitivity due to MDR 1 gene defect. Skin diseases might be of importance in the Dutch population of Border Collies. The most important disorders in the Bouvier des Flandres are: dysphagia-associated muscular dystrophy, glaucoma and subluxation of the radial head. The most important disorders in the Dachshund are: mitral valve prolapse, myoclonic epilepsy (Lafora disease), cataract, achondroplasia/chondrodysplasia and canine intervertebral disk disease. Oncologic and otolaryngologic diseases might be of importance for the Dutch population of Dachshunds. The most important disorder in the Schapendoes is: progressive retina atrophy. Ophthalmologic diseases in general are of great importance in the Dutch population of Schapendoesen...|$|R

Low energy, micro-focus X-ray-generators are now commercially available, but only few of them are used in radiation biology experiments.
