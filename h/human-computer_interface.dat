25|$|In {{a recent}} 2016 article, {{an entirely new}} {{communication}} device and non-EEG-based <b>human-computer</b> <b>interface</b> was developed, requiring no visual fixation or ability to move eyes at all, {{that is based on}} covert interest in (i.e. without fixing eyes on) chosen letter on a virtual keyboard with letters each having its own (background) circle that is micro-oscillating in brightness in different time transitions, where the letter selection is based on best fit between, on one hand, unintentional pupil-size oscillation pattern, and, on the other hand, the circle-in-background's brightness oscillation pattern. Accuracy is additionally improved by user's mental rehearsing the words 'bright' and 'dark' in synchrony with the brightness transitions of the circle/letter.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this article}} we give {{guidelines}} on how to address the major technical challenges of automatic emotion recognition from speech in <b>human-computer</b> <b>interfaces,</b> which include audio segmentation to find appropriate units for emotions, extraction of emotion relevant features, classification of emotions, and training databases with emotional speech. Research so far has mostly dealt with offline evaluation of vocal emotions, and online processing has hardly been addressed. Online processing is, however, a necessary prerequisite for the realization of <b>human-computer</b> <b>interfaces</b> that analyze {{and respond to the}} user’s emotions while he or she is interacting with an application. By means of a sample application, we demonstrate how the challenges arising from online processing may be solved. The overall objective of the paper is to help readers to assess the feasibility of <b>human-computer</b> <b>interfaces</b> that are sensitive to the user’s emotional voice and to provide them with guidelines of how to technically realize such interfaces. ...|$|R

40|$|As {{computing}} devices {{continue to}} become more heavily integrated into our lives, proper design of <b>human-computer</b> <b>interfaces</b> becomes a more important topic of discussion. Efficient and useful <b>human-computer</b> <b>interfaces</b> need {{to take into account}} the abilities of the humans who will be using such interfaces, and adapt to difficulties that different users may face – such as the particular difficulties older users must face. However, various issues in the design of <b>human-computer</b> <b>interfaces</b> for older users yet exist: a wide variance of ability is displayed by older adults, which can be difficult to design for. Motions and notions found intuitive by younger users can be anything but for the older user. Properly-designed devices must also assist without injuring the pride and independence of the users – thus, it’s understood that devices designed “for the elderly” may encounter a poor reception when introduced to the ageing community. Affective computing gives current researchers in HCI a useful opportunity to develop applications with interfaces that detect mood and attention via nonverbal cues and take appropriate actions accordingly. Current work in affective computing applications with older adult users points to possibilities reducing feelings of loneliness i...|$|R
