40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{a simple and}} sensitive kinetic spectrophotometric method for the determination of ramipril in commercial dosage forms. The method {{is based on the}} reaction of the drug with 1 -chloro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene (CDNB) in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at 100 ± 1 º C. The reaction is followed spectrophotometrically by measuring the rate of change of the absorbance at 420 nm. Fixed-time (ΔA) and <b>equilibrium</b> <b>methods</b> are adopted for constructing the calibration curves. Both the calibration curves were found to be linear over the concentration ranges 20 - 220 μg/ml. The regression analysis of calibration data yielded the linear equations: Δ A = 6. 30 × 10 - 4 + 1. 54 × 10 - 3 C and A = 3. 62 × 10 - 4 + 6. 35 × 10 - 3 C for fixed time (Δ A) and <b>equilibrium</b> <b>methods,</b> respectively. The limits of detection (LOD) for fixed time and <b>equilibrium</b> <b>methods</b> are 1. 47 and 1. 05 μg/ml, respectively. The method has been successfully applied to the determination of ramipril in commercial dosage forms.

40|$|The {{stability}} of slopes {{is a major}} problem in geotechnical engineering. Of the methods available for the analysis of soil slopes such as limit <b>equilibrium</b> <b>methods,</b> limit analysis and numerical methods such as FEM and FDM, limit <b>equilibrium</b> <b>methods</b> are popular and generally used, owing to their simplicity in formulation and in evaluating the overall factor of safety of slope. However limit <b>equilibrium</b> <b>methods</b> possess certain disadvantages. They do not consider whether the slope is an embankment or natural slope or an excavation and ignore the effect of incremental construction, initial stress, stress strain behavior etc. In the work reported in this paper, a comparative study of actual state of stress and actual factor of safety and Bishop's factor of safety is performed. The actual factor of safety is obtained by consideration of contours of mobilised shear strains. Using Bishop's method of slices, the critical slip surfaces of a number of soil slopes with different geometries are determined and both the factors of safety are obtained. The actual normal stresses and shear stresses are determined from finite difference formulation using FLAG (Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continuaa) with Mohr-Coulomb model. The comparative study is performed in terms of parameter lambda(c phi) (= gamma H tan phi/c).

50|$|Stuart was {{the first}} pioneer to study the {{interference}} phenomenon of closely spaced surface strip footing. He examined the effect of footing interference on ultimate bearing capacity of strip footings by theoretical analysis using limit <b>equilibrium</b> <b>method,</b> assuming a non-linear failure surface wherein the cross section composed of logarithmic spiral and straight line portion tangent to the curvilinear portion. Further Stuart (1962) carried out few small-scale laboratory experiments and compared the results of theoretical analysis {{with that of the}} experimental results and concluded that the ultimate bearing capacity of two interfering footings increase with decrease in spacing between the footings and attains a peak magnitude at some spacing termed as critical spacing. The study of Stuart (1962) was further extended by West and Stuart (1965) by performing a series of small-scale laboratory tests to examine the effect of interference on bearing capacity of strip footings resting on the surface of cohesion-less soil bed. Moreover, West and Stuart (1965) carried out few theoretical analyses using method of stress characteristics to observe the eccentricity of load and reactions at the base of footing resulting from interference effect for footings resting on the surface of sand. The results obtained from this theory were smaller than those observed by Stuart (1962) using limit equilibrium method; however the trend was similar to the variation as observed by Stuart (1962) and the results obtained by experiments reasonably matched with those of the theoretical analysis. The researchers carried out the study by theoretical or numerical techniques for interfering footings by making use of the following methods : Method of stress characteristics, Analytical method, Probabilistic approach, Upper bound limits analysis, Lower bound limits analysis, Finite element method, Finite difference method.|$|E

The <b>equilibrium</b> cycle <b>method</b> provides an efficient approach for modeling reactor system, compared to the more traditional non-equilibrium cycle fuel management calculation approach. Recently, the <b>equilibrium</b> analysis <b>method</b> has been utilized for designing Accelerator Transmutation of Waste (ATW) [2, 3, 4] cores, in which a scattered-reloading fuel management scheme is used.

The high burnup non-fertile fuel has large variations in composition and reactivity during its lifetime.

40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the reproducibility of the exponential method of CO 2 rebreathing with the use of automated curve fitting and to determine whether this method is superior to the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>method</b> in terms of reproducibility and clinical practicability. METHODS: Repeated measurements of cardiac output were performed using the automated equilibrium and exponential methods. These measurements were compared in 12 healthy male subjects at rest and during incremental exercise tests. RESULTS: Estimated cardiac output was not significantly different between duplicate measurements at rest nor at any level of exercise with either method. At rest the exponential method showed a tendency toward larger variability than the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>method.</b> The exponential method produced significantly higher (P < or = 0. 001) estimates at rest (averaging up to 9. 8 L x min(- 1)) compared with the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>method</b> (averaging up to 6. 5 L x min(- 1)). Reproducibility improved for both methods with increasing workloads, and a second measurement at rest also seemed more reproducible and valid than the first. During exercise, both methods produced comparable values for cardiac output, and highly significant relations between cardiac output and oxygen uptake were observed for both methods (ranging from r 2 = 0. 79 to r 2 = 0. 88, P < or = 0. 001). The <b>equilibrium</b> <b>method</b> produced unpleasant side effects more frequently (75 % vs 21 %, P < or = 0. 001) compared with the exponential method and lead more subjects to premature interruption of the exercise test because of the rebreathing maneuver (42 % vs 17 %, P = 0. 058). CONCLUSIONS: Automated curve fitting for the exponential method gave reproducible and valid results during submaximal and maximal exercise but not at rest. The <b>equilibrium</b> <b>method</b> on the other hand interfered with exercise. Therefore, the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>method</b> is recommended at rest and at lower levels of exercise and the exponential method at higher intensities. status: publishe...|$|E

An iterative procedure is developed to expedite the conver-gence of the solution for the factor of safety. Experience to date indicates that the process generally converges within a few iterations.
