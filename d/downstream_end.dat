5|$|Near its {{junction}} {{with the}} River Arun, the river loops {{to the south}} in a large meander. A cut ran {{from the start of}} the meander to join the Arun above the original junction, with a lock towards the <b>downstream</b> <b>end.</b> The meander fed Hardham Corn Mill. A lock bypassed the mill and the millstream, to enable boats to reach the Hardham Tunnel cut, which headed south from a junction above the mill. The Tunnel Branch was destroyed by the construction of a water treatment works, and the modern weir near the mouth is much closer to the junction than the lock was.|$|E

5000|$|The {{project has}} had mixed results. While {{effectively}} generating electricity, the blocking of water flow by the dam (to allow the tidal difference to accumulate every six hours) {{has resulted in}} increased river bank erosion on both the upstream and <b>downstream</b> <b>ends.</b> The dam {{is also known as}} a trap for marine life.

50|$|The spikedace {{occupies}} midwater habitats of {{runs and}} pools, and prefers moving in water less than 1 m deep {{and in a}} current of 0.3-0.6 m/s. The spikedace concentrates in the <b>downstream</b> <b>ends</b> of rivers, although many have been collected in the upstream portions of shear zones less than 0.33 m deep. In larger streams, the spikedace is found only {{at the mouth of}} creeks.|$|R
40|$|Recession {{characteristics}} play {{an important}} role in the design of border irrigation systems. This is particularly true of those borders which have closed <b>downstream</b> <b>ends</b> where surface storage is large even after the cessation of inflow. This paper examines some of the existing models of border irrigation recession. Using experimental data these models are evaluated and compared with each other in regard to their ability to predict recession flow...|$|R
25|$|They were {{numbered}} from 1 to 75, {{including two}} locks with fractional numbers (63⅓ and 64⅔) and none numbered 65. There {{is also the}} Tidewater Lock, sometimes called Lock 0, lock at the <b>downstream</b> <b>end</b> of the canal in Washington, D.C., where Rock Creek flows into the Potomac River.|$|E
25|$|In {{large scale}} river {{navigation}} improvements, weirs and locks are used together. A weir {{will increase the}} depth of a shallow stretch, and the required lock will either be built in {{a gap in the}} weir, or at the <b>downstream</b> <b>end</b> of an artificial cut which bypasses the weir and perhaps a shallow stretch of river below it. A river improved by these means is often called a Waterway or River Navigation (see example Calder and Hebble Navigation).|$|E
25|$|At the groundbreaking, {{there was}} still {{argument}} over {{the eastern end of}} the canal. The directors thought that Little Falls (at the <b>downstream</b> <b>end</b> of the Patowmack Little Falls Skirting Canal) was sufficient since that literally fulfilled the charter's condition of reaching the tidewater, but people in Washington wanted it to end in Washington, connecting to the Tiber Creek and Anacostia river. For that reason, the canal originally opened from Little Falls to Seneca, and the next year, was extended down to Georgetown.|$|E

50|$|The method {{consists}} of filling the flow area with stream and equipotential lines, which are everywhere perpendicular to each other, making a curvilinear grid. Typically {{there are two}} surfaces (boundaries) which are at constant values of potential or hydraulic head (upstream and <b>downstream</b> <b>ends),</b> and the other surfaces are no-flow boundaries (i.e., impermeable; for example {{the bottom of the}} dam and the top of an impermeable bedrock layer), which define the sides of the outermost streamtubes (see figure 1 for a stereotypical flownet example).|$|R
40|$|A magnetoplasmadynamic {{thruster}} formulation involving coupled aerothermodynamic-electromagnetic equations {{and including}} viscous effects is developed and solved. The effect of various input parameters on the radial current density distribution at the longitudinal cathode surface is studied. In general, radial current concentrations are {{found at the}} upstream and <b>downstream</b> <b>ends</b> of the cathode. The upstream current concentration is larger in magnitude and is attributed to large values of the Hall parameter. Higher inlet velocities and densities, lower inlet temperatures and propellants of lower molecular weight, all reduce the upstream current concentration. The downstream current concentration is attributed to large values of the inlet velocity...|$|R
25|$|In 1912 Eiffel's {{laboratory}} {{was moved}} to Auteuil, a suburb of Paris, where his wind tunnel with a 2-metre test section is still operational today. Eiffel significantly improved {{the efficiency of the}} open-return wind tunnel by enclosing the test section in a chamber, designing a flared inlet with a honeycomb flow straightener and adding a diffuser between the test section and the fan located at the <b>downstream</b> <b>end</b> of the diffuser; this was an arrangement followed by a number of wind tunnels later built; in fact the open-return low speed wind tunnel is often called the Eiffel-type wind tunnel.|$|E
25|$|The race {{begins at}} the <b>downstream</b> <b>end</b> of Temple Island, where the crews attach {{to a pair of}} pontoons. The race umpire will then call out the names of the two crews and start them when they are both {{straight}} and ready. Each crew is assigned to row on either the 'Bucks' (Buckinghamshire) or 'Berks' (Berkshire) side of the race course. The coxswains or steersmen are expected to keep their crew on the allocated side of the course at all times during the race, else they risk disqualification. The only exception is when a crew leads by a sizeable margin and is not deemed by the umpire to be impeding the trailing crew.|$|E

50|$|In 2001 the Government sought {{proposals}} {{for a solution}} that would allow a typical flood of three to six hours’ duration to occur without flooding the city centre. A tunnel that would allow floods to bypass the centre was one way of achieving this, providing it was coupled with temporary storage facilities to keep flows downstream of Kuala Lumpur within {{the capacity of the}} river channel. A group led by Gamuda engaged SSP, a large Malaysian consultant engineering firm, and Mott MacDonald UK to develop {{proposals for}} a tunnel with holding ponds at upstream and <b>downstream</b> <b>ends</b> of the tunnel.|$|R
40|$|Describes {{the theory}} and use of a {{numerical}} model for the simulation of unsteady flows along closed and open conduits in an urban drainage system. The model discussed {{is based on the}} conceptualisation of the drainage system into a network of nodes and links and the use of this conceptualisation to develop an efficient solution algorithm for the unsteady flow simulation. Inherent in this approach is the use of network units; each unit comprising a single link with nodes at the upstream and <b>downstream</b> <b>ends</b> of the link. Data requirements and the format of the datafiles required for operation of the model are presented in this report...|$|R
40|$|The {{appearance}} of many streamlike features on Mars indicates {{the formation of}} channels through erosion by liquid water. We suggest that streams originating at meteorite crater boundaries {{are the result of}} impact which released subsurface water trapped below the Martian surface by a layer of permafrost. Features indicating surface erosion are the presence of alluvial plains at the <b>downstream</b> <b>ends</b> of channels, an increase in stream width with distance from the meteorite craters, and a direct correlation among several examples between crater diameter and stream length. Water released from the subsurface is preferred over rainfall as a mechanism for the origin of stream channels originating from craters on Mars...|$|R
500|$|In January 2008 Bob Bindschadler (NASA) {{landed on}} the {{floating}} ice shelf of PIG, this is at the <b>downstream</b> <b>end</b> where it floats on the sea. This landing, by a Twin Otter plane fitted with skis, was the first ever landing on this ice shelf. The reason for landing on the ice shelf was for a reconnaissance mission to investigate the feasibility of drilling through around [...] of ice, to lower instruments into the ocean cavity below. It is hoped that this will provide important information on {{the link between the}} ocean and Pine Island Glacier. It was decided that the small crevasse free area was too hard for further landings and so further fieldwork had to be postponed. Therefore, two GPS units and a weather station were positioned as near as possible to PIG.|$|E

30|$|Flow through {{collapsible}} tubes {{has been}} extensively studied in the laboratory. Pioneering work on collapsible tubes, explain that the veins {{play an important role}} in controlling the output of the heart. This control function of the veins is a passive one, and is as a result of their ability to collapse and inflate. Several experimental studies have been done on flexible tubing. For instance Bertram (1986) did an experimental study on collapsible and elastic tubes with finite-length and the upstream and <b>downstream</b> <b>ends</b> held open. He concluded that when the external pressure exceeded the fluid pressure by a sufficiently large amount, the tube buckled non-axi symmetrically, leading to a nonlinear relation between pressure-drop and flow rate.|$|R
50|$|The {{park has}} four main physiographic regions. The upthrust granite Chigmit Mountains connect the Alaska Range to the Aleutian Range. Superimposed on these {{mountains}} and little {{to the east of}} the main range are the two stratovolcanoes, Redoubt 10197 ft high, and Iliamna at 10016 ft. Glaciers have altered the mountains, carving cirques and U-shaped valleys into the range, which end abruptly on the east at the steep coast in deep bays or in outwash flats. On the west the glaciers have cut deeply enough to create lakes, dammed by terminal moraines at their <b>downstream</b> <b>ends.</b> Lake Clark, the largest, is the sixth largest lake in Alaska, 860 ft deep and 42 mi long.|$|R

Additional Ðndings include spectral gradients in compact hot spots and possible transitions in jet properties at the <b>downstream</b> <b>ends</b> of the diuse lobes. The complexity of behaviors uncovered here points to the need for a thorough investigation of numerical models for radio galaxies, as well as for detailed observational studies of larger, unbiased samples.

40|$|The radial {{current density}} {{distribution}} on the cathode longitudinal surface of magnetoplasmadynamic arcjets for axisymmetric geometries has been obtained by simultaneous {{solution of the}} electromagnetic equations for a given uniform gas dynamic field.

The solution for the current density distribution displays current concentrations at two locations, that is, at the upstream and <b>downstream</b> <b>ends</b> of the cathode. This result is in conformity with known experimental data. The parameters responsible for these current concentrations are identified. It is shown that the effect of the magnetic Reynolds number on the current density distribution is different depending on whether or not the Hall effect is included.
