50|$|Acidophiles {{display a}} great range of adaptations {{to not just}} tolerating, but {{thriving}} in an <b>extreme</b> <b>pH</b> <b>environment</b> (the definition of an acidophile being an organism that has a pH optimum below pH 3). Principal in these is the necessity of maintaining a large pH gradient, to ensure a circumneutral cytoplasm (normally, however not in Picrophilus species). The archaeans have already been discussed above, and further information on their and bacterial adaptations are in basic form in the Figure. To elaborate upon the figure, the bacteria also use membrane proton blocking to maintain a high cytoplasmic pH, which is a passive system as even non-respiring A.ferrooxidans exhibit it. Acidophiles are also able to extrude protons against the pH gradient with unique transport proteins, a process more difficult for moderate- and hyper-thermophiles; a higher temperature causes cell membranes to become more permeable to protons, necessarily leading to increased H+ influx, {{in the absence of}} other membrane alterations.|$|R

However, their adaptability mechanism is unclear. In this study, we isolated an acid-tolerant strain of Penicillium funiculosum, which can grow actively at pH 1. 0 and thrived in pH 0. 6. A major facilitator superfamily transporter (PfMFS) was isolated from an acid-sensitive random insertional mutant (M 4) of the fungus. It encodes a putative protein of 551 residues and contains 14 transmembrane-spanning segments. A targeted mutant (M 7) carrying an inactivated copy of PfMFS showed an obvious reduction of growth compared with the wild type (WT) and complementation of M 7 with PfMFS restored the wild-type level of growth at pH 1. 0. Further data showed that the wild-type showed higher intracellular pH than M 7 in response to pH 1. Subcellular localization showed that PfMFS was a cell membrane protein. Homology modeling showed structural similarity with an MFS transporter EmrD from Escherichia coli.

We also used scanning and transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction to investigate the ultrastructure of forisomes, finding that individual fibers are arranged into compact fibril bundles that disentangle with minimal residual order in the presence of calcium ions. To demonstrate the potential applications of artificial forisomes, we created :hybrid protein bodies from forisome subunits fused to the B-domain of staphylococcal protein A. This allowed the functionalization of the artificial forisomes with antibodies that were then used to target forisomes to specific regions on a substrate, providing a straightforward approach to develop forisome-based technical devices with precise configurations. The functional contractile properties of forisomes are also better preserved when they are immobilized via affinity reagents rather than by direct contact to the substrate. Artificial forisomes produced in plants and yeast therefore provide an ideal model for the investigation of forisome structure and assembly and for the design and testing of tailored artificial forisomes for technical applications...|$|E

We hypothesized, that some very special DNA repair strategies need to be applied in bacteria and archaea living in those extreme circumstances. It is a difficult task to evaluate the results obtained from mostly unknown species. Therefore we applied again the HMMER profiling: for the identified DNA repair genes in the extreme metagenomes, we prepared new HMMER profiles (for each genes separately, subsequent to a cluster analysis); and we searched for similarities to those profiles in well-known model organisms.

Here, we show that in the presence of pyruvate, this micro-organism is capable of reducing both soluble Fe(III) -citrate and solid-phase hydrous ferric oxide, although growth is sustained by pyruvate fermentation rather than Fe(III) respiration. Despite the fact that Fe(III) reduction does not support direct energy conservation, D. reducens uses it as a complementary means of discarding excess reducing equivalent after H 2 accumulation in the culture head-space renders proton reduction unfavorable. Thus, Fe(III) reduction permits the oxidation of greater amounts of pyruvate than fermentation alone. Fe(III) reduction by D. reducens is mediated by a soluble electron carrier, most likely riboflavin. Additionally, an intracellular electron storage molecule acts as a capacitor and accumulates electrons during pyruvate oxidation for slow release to Fe(III). The reductase responsible for the transfer of electrons from the capacitor to the soluble carrier has not been identified, but data presented here argue against the involvement of c-type cytochromes...|$|R

The elastic area compressibility modulus was unaffected between pH 3 and 9 but was reduced by ∼ 30 % at pH 2. Fluorescence experiments utilizing the phase-sensitive probe Laurdan confirmed gel-phase characteristics at pH 2, explaining the reduction of membrane elasticity. The membrane bending stiffness, kc, increased by ∼ 40 % at pH 4 and pH 9 over the control value at pH 6. 5. Electrophoretic mobility measurements indicate that these changes are qualitatively consistent with theoretical models that predict the effect of membrane surface charge density and Debye length on kc, substantiating a coupling between the mechanical and interfacial electrical properties of the membrane. The effect of pH on intramembrane electrical properties was examined by studying the spectral shifts of the potentiometric probe di- 8 ANEPPS. The intramembrane (dipole) potential (Ψd) increased linearly as the solution pH decreased {{in a manner consistent}} with the partitioning of hydroxide ions into the membrane.

40|$|Variation {{in ambient}} pH {{is known to}} exert {{profound}} effects on ionoregulation and acid–base balance in decapod crustaceans, yet there is relatively little information on either metabolism or O 2 transport. Consideration of the respiratory {{as well as the}} ionic and acid–base responses to <b>extreme</b> <b>pH</b> <b>environments</b> is pertinent, since branchial ionoregulatory mechanisms also affect gas exchange via acid–base balance (Na+/H+, Cl 2 /HCO 32 or OH 2) (Wheatly and McMahon, 1981). The effect of extreme pH on the acid–base and ion physiology of the Australian crayfish Cherax destructor has been investigated (Ellis and Morris, 1995). The investigation reported here considers the effects of extreme pH on oxygen uptake and metabolic status. It has been proposed that acid and alkaline environments may increase energy expenditure for maintenance of homeostasis, which could subsequently reduce energy available for growth and reproduction (e. g. Spaargaren, 1975; Neville, 1985; Mangum, 1986; Hargeby, 1990). In addition, low levels of calcium in the water may further increase the energy expenditure required for homeostasis (Wood and Rogano, 1986). Exposure of trout to pH 4. 0 soft water, although impairing O 2 transport, does not limit resting O 2 consumption but reduces the scope for activity (Ye et al. 1991). More extreme acid conditions do impair resting O 2 uptake, suggesting that an acidosis may actually reduce O 2 consumption by direct action on metabolism at the tissue level. The objectives of this study were, first, to determine the consequences of extreme environmental pH for the haemolymph O 2 transport and delivery to the tissues in Cherax destructor and the requirement for anaerobiosis, thereby assessing to what extent acid or alkaline toxicity represents an energetically ‘expensive ’ environment for this species.

Results A newly soil-isolated Staphylococcus sp. strain ESW secretes an induced lipase in the culture medium. The effects of temperature, pH and various components in a detergent on the activity and stability of Staphylococcus sp. lipase (SL 1) were studied in a preliminary evaluation for use in detergent formulation solutions. The enzyme was highly active over a wide range of pH from 9. 0 to 13. 0, with an optimum at pH 12. 0. The relative activity at pH 13. 0 was about 60 % of that obtained at pH 12. 0.

Through protein engineering, several Clostridium difficile toxin A-specific heavy chain antibody variable domains (V(H) Hs) were expressed with an additional disulfide bond by introducing Ala/Gly 54 Cys and Ile 78 Cys mutations. Mutant antibodies were compared to their wild-type counterparts with respect to expression yield, non-aggregation status, affinity for toxin A, circular dichroism (CD) structural signatures, thermal stability, protease resistance, and toxin A-neutralizing capacity. The mutant V(H) Hs {{were found to be}} well expressed, although with lower yields compared to wild-type counterparts, were non-aggregating monomers, retained low nM affinity for toxin A, albeit the majority showed somewhat reduced affinity compared to wild-type counterparts, and were capable of in vitro toxin A neutralization in cell-based assays. Far-UV and near-UV CD spectroscopy consistently showed shifts in peak intensity and selective peak minima for wild-type and mutant V(H) H pairs; however, the overall CD profile remained very similar. A significant increase in the thermal unfolding midpoint temperature was observed for all mutants at both neutral and acidic pH. Digestion of the V(H) Hs with the major gastrointestinal proteases, at biologically relevant concentrations, revealed a significant increase in pepsin resistance for all mutants and an increase in chymotrypsin resistance for the majority of mutants. Mutant V(H) H trypsin resistance was similar to that of wild-type V(H) Hs, although the trypsin resistance of one V(H) H mutant was significantly reduced. Therefore, the introduction of a second disulfide bond in the hydrophobic core not only increases V(H) H thermal stability at neutral pH, as previously shown, but also represents a generic strategy to increase V(H) H stability at low pH and impart protease resistance, with only minor perturbations in target binding affinities.
