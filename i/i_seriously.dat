He declined the royal honour of Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2000, and turned down a knighthood in 2003. Bowie later stated [...] "I would never have any intention of accepting anything like that. <b>I</b> <b>seriously</b> don't know what it's for. It's not what I spent my life working for." ...|$|E
500|$|Tisdale got {{her first}} start on Billboard when {{she became the first}} female artist in history to debut with two songs on the Billboard Hot 100, from the soundtrack of High School Musical. Tisdale called the feat [...] "crazy," [...] stating, [...] "When I think about artists like Madonna and Beyoncé...it’s surreal. <b>I</b> <b>seriously</b> can’t {{comprehend}} it." [...] Soon after the completion of High School Musical, Tisdale began work on her debut album. In December 2006, producer J.R. Rotem confirmed he was producing and writing with Tisdale for the album.|$|E

[...] Miller credited Molina's leadership behind the plate and preparation: [...] "Yadi knows everything about every single hitter, exactly what to throw. [...] If you execute your pitches and throw them where he wants the ball, you're going to get hitters out, have a better ERA, win the game.

500|$|In a {{friendly}} away at Plymouth Argyle a week later, he slipped {{as he went}} into a tackle and injured his knee. Dodgin brought Bill Ellerington back into the side to replace Ramsey while he recovered, and Ellerington performed strongly as Southampton won eight and drew two of the next 10 matches. Dodgin told Ramsey that, given Ellerington's good form, Ramsey was [...] "going to find it very hard" [...] to regain {{his place in the}} team. Ramsey, not yet in his 30s, was infuriated and considered this a direct insult by Dodgin: he subsequently asked Southampton to place him on the transfer list on 7 March 1949. He obsessed about Dodgin's comment. [...] "The world did indeed appear a dark and unfriendly place," [...] he later said; [...] "...for one fleeting moment <b>I</b> <b>seriously</b> contemplated quitting football." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to acting in films, Chopra {{is active in}} charity work and supports a number of causes. She walked the ramp at the Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week to support the Shabana Azmi Mijwan Welfare Society, an NGO dedicated to empowering girls. Chopra said, [...] "I don't {{want it to be}} just about ramp walk, but <b>I</b> <b>seriously</b> and genuinely feel for what Mijwan and what Manish and Shabanaji are doing. For such an initiative, I just could not say no. I had {{to be a part of}} it." [...] She also appeared on NDTV's Greenathon, an initiative to support eco-friendliness and investigate poor electricity supplies in rural villages, to lend her support. Apart from charity work, she serves as an ambassador for a number of brands. Chopra endorses brands such as Kurkure, Nivea, Maaza and Spinz, WeChat, Pantene and Mahindra scooty. She became the first Bollywood star to endorse products from both Coke (Maaza) and PepsiCo (Kurkure) at the same time.|$|E

Veer noted that he was not upset with the similarities, saying that he takes inspiration from other games too: [...] "I seriously think this is perfectly okay. After all, Autumn Leaves' inspirations are countless ... and being influenced is a natural part of the writing process." [...] Veer said that having the names of modders in the game's credits for acknowledgement would be beneficial. He also said that he was comfortable even if Bethesda did deliberately use content from Autumn Leaves, and wrote that [...] "I honestly thought Bethesda’s staff played Autumn Leaves, had a blast with it, took some things out of it and made their own thing for Far Harbor. ... And <b>I</b> <b>seriously</b> think this is perfectly okay." ...|$|E

500|$|Elgar having died in 1934, the {{authorities}} turned to Walton {{to compose a}} march in the Elgarian tradition for the coronation of George VI in 1937. His Crown Imperial was an immediate success with the public, but disappointed those of Walton's admirers who {{thought of him as}} an avant garde composer. Among Walton's other works from this decade are more film scores, including the first of his incidental music for Shakespeare adaptations, As You Like It (1936); a short ballet for a West End revue (1936); and a choral piece, In Honour of the City of London (1937). His most important work of the 1930s, alongside the symphony, was the Violin Concerto (1939), commissioned by Jascha Heifetz. The concerto, Walton later revealed, expressed his love for Alice Wimborne. Its strong romantic style caused some critics to label it retrogressive, and Walton said in a newspaper interview, [...] "Today's white hope is tomorrow's black sheep. These days it is very sad for a composer to grow old ... <b>I</b> <b>seriously</b> advise all sensitive composers to die at the age of 37. I know: I've gone through the first halcyon period and am just about ripe for my critical damnation." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewing {{the track}} for AOL Radio Blog, Voerding wrote [...] "Michele's voice {{is among the}} cast's most versatile, striding {{confidently}} through growls and whispers, proclamations and wavering cries. This single, with the drive of its melody and narrative, is no exception." [...] Kirsten Coachman of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer called Michele's voice on the song [...] "phenomenal," [...] and commented [...] "I love how her vocals are reined in, and then build up to that wonderful glory note. <b>I</b> <b>seriously</b> got chills while listening to it." [...] She also commented how the song's narrative fit Michele's storyline on the show. Christopher Rosen of Movieline wrote [...] "If you love Lea Michele’s voice, you’ll like [...] "Get It Right." [...] Becky Bain of Idolator said [...] "This one, compared to the instantly catchy “Loser Like Me”, {{is a bit more}} underwhelming, though Lea kills it." [...] Jarret Wieselman of The New York Post said [...] "Lea Michele's voice was on point throughout this soaring ballad, but without that secret ingredient, lyrics like [...] "my best intentions keep making a mess of things" [...] are best left to Rachel's diary." [...] Although she called it [...] "boring" [...] and said it was like every other reflection-ballad performed by Michele, Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone said that the song would fit in on Top 40 radio. Melinda Newman of HitFix said the song was [...] "lovely, but a bit dull." ...|$|E

2500|$|... or {{the present}} we may {{conclude}} quite confidently that the Tyrian king list of Menander as preserved in Josephus' Contra Apionem , 1:117-26, {{coupled with the}} dated reference in Shalmaneser's annals to the Tyrian king Ba'li-manzer and the date of Pompeius Trogus for the founding of Carthage, provide a firm external synchronism for biblical chronology, and particularly for the dating {{of the founding of}} Solomon's temple in 968 (the twelfth year of Hiram of Tyre), as well as the dating of Solomon's accession to 971. A variation of a year or two is possible, of course, especially in the light of our ignorance of Phoenician dating practices, but <b>I</b> <b>seriously</b> doubt that an error of more than two years either way is likely.|$|E

2500|$|A {{reason for}} not {{revealing}} it to everyone is partially discussed in Phaedrus (276 c) where Plato criticizes the written transmission of knowledge as faulty, favoring instead the spoken logos: [...] "he who has knowledge of the just and the good and beautiful ... will not, when in earnest, write them in ink, sowing them through a pen with words, which cannot defend themselves by argument and cannot teach the truth effectually." [...] The same argument is repeated in Plato's Seventh Letter (344 c): [...] "every serious man in dealing with really serious subjects carefully avoids writing." [...] In the same letter he writes (341 c): [...] "I can certainly declare concerning all these writers who claim to know the subjects that <b>I</b> <b>seriously</b> study ... there does not exist, nor will there ever exist, any treatise of mine dealing therewith." [...] Such secrecy is necessary in order not [...] "to expose them to unseemly and degrading treatment" [...] (344 d).|$|E
2500|$|At the trial, the {{prosecution}} sought to have entered into evidence a fingerprint card containing Clay Shaw's signature and admission {{to using the}} alias [...] "Clay Bertrand." [...] In regard to this, Judge Edward Haggerty, after dismissing the jury, conducted a day-long hearing, in which he ruled the fingerprint card inadmissible. He said that two policemen had violated Shaw's constitutional rights by not permitting the defendant to have his lawyer present during the fingerprinting. Judge Haggerty also announced that Officer Habighorst had violated Miranda v. Arizona and Escobedo v. Illinois by not informing Clay Shaw {{that he had the}} right to remain silent. The judge said that Habighorst had violated Shaw's rights by allegedly questioning him about an alias, adding, [...] "Even if he did [...] it is not admissible." [...] Judge Haggerty exclaimed, [...] "If Officer Habighorst is telling the truth — and <b>I</b> <b>seriously</b> doubt it!" [...] The judge finished with the statement, [...] "I do not believe Officer Habighorst!" ...|$|E
2500|$|What's Going On was {{generally}} well received by contemporary critics. In Rolling Stone, Vince Aletti praised Gaye's thematic approach towards {{social and political}} concerns, while discussing the surprise of Motown releasing such an album. In a joint review of What's Going On and Stevie Wonder's Where I'm Coming From, Aletti wrote, [...] "Ambitious, personal albums may be a glut on the market elsewhere, but at Motown they're something new... the album as a whole takes precedence, absorbing its own flaws. There are very few performers who could carry a project like this off. I've always admired Marvin Gaye, but I didn't expect {{that he would be}} one of them. Guess <b>I</b> <b>seriously</b> underestimated him. It won't happen again." [...] Billboard described the record as [...] "a cross between Curtis Mayfield and that old Motown spell and outdoes anything Gaye's ever done". Time magazine hailed it as a [...] "vast, melodically deft symphonic pop suite". Village Voice critic Robert Christgau was less impressed. He deemed it both a [...] "groundbreaking personal statement" [...] and a Berry Gordy product, baited by three highly original singles but marred elsewhere by indistinct music and indulgent use of David Van De Pitte's strings, which Christgau called [...] "the lowest kind of movie-background dreck".|$|E

2500|$|On 4 April 2011 Attorney General Eric Holder {{announced}} that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed {{and four other}} 9/11 terror suspects will face a military trial at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. In announcing his decision, Holder blasted Congress for imposing restrictions on the Justice Department's ability to bring the men to New York City for civilian trials. [...] "After thoroughly studying the case, {{it became clear to}} me that the best venue for prosecution was in federal court. I stand by that decision today," [...] Holder said. [...] "As the president has said, those unwise and unwarranted restrictions (imposed by Congress) undermine our counterterrorism efforts and could harm our national security. Decisions about who, where and how to prosecute have always been - and must remain - the responsibility of the executive branch." [...] Holder insisted, [...] "We were prepared to bring a powerful case against Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and his four co-conspirators - one of the most well-researched and documented cases I have ever seen in my decades of experience as a prosecutor." [...] He added, [...] "Had this case proceeded in Manhattan or in an alternative venue in the United States, as <b>I</b> <b>seriously</b> explored in the past year, I am confident that our justice system would have performed with the same distinction that has been its hallmark for over 200 years." [...] Holder had promised to seek the death penalty for each of the five men and on 4 April he warned that it is an [...] "open question" [...] if such a penalty can be imposed by a military commission if the defendants plead guilty.|$|E
