5|$|Though the Mellotron was not {{extensively}} {{used in the}} 1980s, {{a number}} of bands featured it as a prominent instrument. One of the few UK post-punk bands to do so was Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, who featured it heavily on their platinum-selling 1981 album Architecture & Morality.

IQ's Martin Orford bought a second-hand M400 and used it primarily for visual appeal rather than musical quality or convenience.|$|E
