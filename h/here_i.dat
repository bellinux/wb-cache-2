5|$|Around {{the middle}} of the film we show the Purim festival, a victory festival which the Jews {{celebrate}} as a festival of revenge on the Goyim, the Christians. <b>Here</b> <b>I</b> am depicting authentic Jewry as it was then and as it now continues unchecked in Poland. In contrast to this original Jewry, we are presented with Süss, the elegant financial adviser to the Court, the clever politician in short, the Jew in disguise.|$|E
5|$|Despite the poem's {{doubt and}} darkness, {{a note of}} hope is struck by {{the first line of}} the fifth section, 'So <b>here</b> <b>I</b> am in the middle way'.

Although the descent is {{predicated}} on going astray, so also is persevering beyond it into the light.|$|E
