50|$|A switchblade (also {{known as}} an {{automatic}} knife, pushbutton knife, ejector knife, switch, Sprenger, Springer, flick knife, or flick blade) {{is a type of}} knife with a folding or sliding <b>blade</b> contained in <b>the</b> handle which is opened automatically by a spring when a button, lever, or switch on the handle or bolster is activated. Most switchblade designs incorporate a locking <b>blade,</b> in which <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> is locked against closure when <b>the</b> spring <b>extends</b> <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> to <b>the</b> fully opened position. <b>The</b> <b>blade</b> is unlocked by manually operating a mechanism that unlocks <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> and allows it to be folded and locked in the closed position.|$|R

5000|$|In 1918, Captain Rupert Hughes of the U.S. Army {{submitted}} a patent {{application for a}} specialized automatic-opening trench knife of his own design, the Hughes Trench Knife. [...] This was a curious device consisting of a folding spring-loaded knife blade attached to a handle which fastened {{to the back of}} the hand and was secured by a leather strap, leaving the palm and fingers free for grasping other objects. [...] Pressing a button on <b>the</b> handle automatically <b>extended</b> <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> into an open and locked position, allowing the knife to be used as a stabbing weapon. [...] The Hughes Trench Knife was evaluated as a potential military arm by a panel of U.S. Army officers from the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) in June 1918. [...] Unfortunately, after testing the board found the Hughes design to be of no value, and it was never adopted. [...] Hughes went on to patent his automatic trench knife in 1919, though it appears to have never interested any civilian manufacturers.|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} a smart wind turbine with {{telescopic}} blades was analyzed using a mathematical model based on <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> element – momentum theory. <b>The</b> telescopic <b>blade</b> concept uses <b>the</b> idea of <b>extending</b> <b>the</b> turbine <b>blades</b> when wind speeds fall below rated level, hence increasing the swept area, and thus maintaining a relatively high power output. It is shown for a typical site, that the annual energy output of such a wind turbine that could double its blade length, could be twice that of a corresponding turbine with fixed length blades. From a cost analysis, it is shown that the concept would be feasible if {{the cost of the}} rotor could be kept less than 4. 3 times the cost of a standard rotor with fixed length <b>blades.</b> Given <b>the</b> telescopic <b>blade</b> turbine system exhibits a more-or-less linear maximum power curve, as opposed to a non-linear curve for the standard turbine, an innovative hybrid mechanical-electrical power conversion system is proposed...|$|R

30|$|Addition of tubercles to <b>the</b> <b>blades</b> {{was done}} with the intent of {{decreasing}} the drag {{and at the same time}} increasing the lift-to-drag ratio without sacrificing structure stability of <b>the</b> <b>blades.</b> When comparing <b>the</b> normal <b>blades</b> with and without tubercles, it was shown that <b>the</b> <b>blades</b> with tubercles had lower maximum stresses and displacements. This proved the tubercles did not lose any structural strength. The same was true for <b>the</b> <b>extended</b> normal <b>blades</b> with tubercles and without. Comparing <b>the</b> maple <b>blades,</b> there was a slight increase in maximum stress for <b>the</b> maple seed <b>blades</b> with tubercles.

40|$|The maize leaf {{consists}} of four distinct tissues along its proximodistal axis: sheath, ligule, auricle and blade. liguleless 1 (lg 1) functions cell autonomously to specify ligule and auricle, and may propagate a signal that correctly positions the blade-sheath boundary. The dominant Wavy auricle in blade (Wab 1) mutation disrupts both the mediolateral and proximodistal axes of the maize leaf. Wab 1 leaf blades are narrow and ectopic auricle and sheath <b>extend</b> into <b>the</b> <b>blade.</b> <b>The</b> recessive lg 1 -R mutation exacerbates the Wab 1 phenotype; in the double mutants, most of <b>the</b> proximal <b>blade</b> is deleted and sheath tissue <b>extends</b> along <b>the</b> residual <b>blade.</b> We show that lg 1 is misexpressed in Wab 1 leaves. Our {{results suggest that the}} Wab 1 defect is partially compensated for by lg 1 expression. A mosaic analysis of Wab 1 was conducted in Lg 1 + and lg 1 -R backgrounds to determine if Wab 1 affects leaf development in a cell-autonomous manner. Normal tissue identity was restored in all wab 1 +/- sectors in a lg 1 -R mutant background, and in three quarters of sectors in a Lg 1 + background. These results suggest that lg 1 can influence the autonomy of Wab 1. In both genotypes, leaf-halves with wab 1 +/- sectors were significantly wider than non-sectored leaf-halves, suggesting that Wab 1 acts cell-autonomously to affect lateral growth. The mosaic analysis, lg 1 expression data and comparison of mutant leaf shapes reveal previously unreported functions of lg 1 in both normal leaf development and in the dominant Wab 1 mutant...|$|R

40|$|Results from {{experimental}} {{investigations of}} <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> passage flow {{in a model}} pump impeller of low specific speed are described. It is found that the flow inside the rotating impeller passages is well described by the flow distribution postulated by potential-flow arguments and boundary-layer considerations. Using a custom-designed two-component laser-Doppler-velocimetry flow measurement system, mounted on a frame co-rotating with an impeller, the radial and circumferential velocity components of the relative flow inside an impeller passage were measured. Measurements were taken from blade to blade, and from this the passagewise fluid velocity was determined. The measured passagewise fluid velocity is compared to the potential-flow solution of the impeller passage-flow velocity that holds asymptotically in a region well away from <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> tips. Additional potential-flow finite-element calculations are used for comparison for those regions where the asymptotic expansion does not hold. The agreement between the experimental and theoretical values is seen {{to be good for}} the core flow region, which <b>extends</b> from <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> pressure side to the viscous boundary layer at <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> suction side. Furthermore, the calculation of the boundary-layer development along the suction side of <b>the</b> impeller <b>blades</b> is highlighted. Contrary to <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> pressure side, only there a significant departure from inviscid flow behaviour is observed. Calculations performed in the ordinary fashion, i. e. employment of the common thin-shear-layer approximation, substantiate the conception that for a low-specific-speed impeller the effects of spanwise rotation and modest surface curvature are accommodated in the description of the invisci...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} a series of {{measurements}} taken over the past year of the acoustic emissions from the DOE/NASA MOD- 1 Wind Turbine show the maximum acoustic energy is concentrated in the low frequency range, often below 100 Hz. The temporal as well as the frequency characteristics of the turbine sounds {{have been shown to be}} important since the MOD- 1 is capable of radiating both coherent and incoherent noise. The coherent sounds are usually impulsive and are manifested in an averaged frequency domain plot as large numbers of discrete energy bands <b>extending</b> from <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> passage frequency to beyond 50 Hz on occasion. It is these impulsive sounds which are identified as the principal source of the annoyance to a dozen families living within 3 km of the turbine. The source of the coherent noise appears to be <b>the</b> rapid, unsteady <b>blade</b> loads encountered as <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> passes through <b>the</b> wake of the tower structure. Annoying levels are occasionally reached at nearby homes due to the interaction of the low frequency, high energy peaks in the acoustic impulses and the structural modes of the homes as well as by direct radiation outdoors.

50|$|Froes {{are similar}} in general form to axes, in that a froe is an L-shaped {{assembly}} of a blade head (typically steel) set at a right angle to a handle called a haft (traditionally wood). A froe {{can be thought of}} as an axe which is sharpened along the top of a long, narrow, rectangular head, instead of (as the axe is) at the end of a broad curved head. Some froes are made of a single piece of metal with no perpendicular haft. Instead, the handle is the unbeveled end of <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> which <b>extends</b> directly from <b>the</b> <b>blade.</b> These froes must be hammered through the entire piece of wood, as their lack of vertical haft makes it extremely difficult to lever the wood apart. A given froe can split a piece of wood no wider in its narrowest dimension than the length of the froe's blade; that is, when you place the froe, it must cross the surface of the wood completely.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the feasibility analysis of an innovative, extensible <b>blade</b> technology. <b>The</b> <b>blade</b> aims to significantly improve the energy {{production of a}} wind turbine, particularly at locations with unfavorable wind conditions. <b>The</b> innovative ‘smart’ <b>blade</b> will be extended at low wind speed to harvest more wind energy; on the other hand, it will be retracted to its original shape when the wind speed is above the rated wind speed to protect <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> from damages by high wind loads. An established aerodynamic model is implemented in this paper to evaluate and compare the power output of extensible blades versus a baseline conventional <b>blade.</b> <b>The</b> model was first validated with a monitored power production curve based on the wind energy production data of a conventional turbine blade, which is subsequently used to estimate the power production curve of <b>extended</b> <b>blades.</b> <b>The</b> load-on-blade structures are incorporated as the mechanical criteria to design the extension strategies.
