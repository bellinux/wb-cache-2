5|$|Synthetic diamond has {{potential}} uses as a semiconductor, {{because it can}} be doped with impurities like boron and phosphorus. Since these elements contain one more or one less valence electron than carbon, they turn synthetic diamond into p-type or n-type semiconductor. Making a p–n junction by sequential doping of synthetic diamond with boron and phosphorus produces light-emitting diodes (LEDs) producing UV light of 235nm. Another useful property of synthetic diamond for electronics is <b>high</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>mobility,</b> which reaches 4500cm2/(V·s) for electrons in single-crystal CVD diamond. High mobility is favourable for high-frequency operation and field-effect transistors made from diamond have already demonstrated promising high-frequency performance above 50GHz. The wide band gap of diamond (5.5 eV) gives it excellent dielectric properties. Combined with the high mechanical stability of diamond, those properties are being used in prototype high-power switches for power stations.|$|E

It attracted renewed attention because of its potential in optoelectronics and electronics due to its band gap, which can be tuned via modifying its thickness, anisotropic photoelectronic properties and <b>high</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>mobility.</b> Phosphorene was initially prepared using mechanical cleavage, a commonly used technique in graphene production {{that is difficult to}} scale up.

40|$|The {{effects of}} La {{incorporation}} in three transition-metal (TM = Y, Zr, and Nb) oxides as gate dielectric of pentacene organic thin-film transistor (OTFT) have been investigated. La incorporated in Zr oxide and Nb oxide greatly decreases their trap density (as confirmed by low-frequency noise measurement) by passivating their oxygen vacancies, resulting in larger pentacene grains grown on them (as shown by atomic force microscopy) and thus <b>higher</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>mobility</b> for the OTFT due to less grain-boundary scattering. The <b>carrier</b> <b>mobility</b> of the ZrLaO- and NbLaO-OTFTs is about 70 times and 300 {{times higher than}} that of their counterparts based on ZrO 2 and Nb 2 O 5, respectively. However, La incorporated in Y 2 O 3 increases its trap density by roughening its surface, causing smaller pentacene grains grown and thus lower <b>carrier</b> <b>mobility.</b> On the other hand, all the three TM elements incorporated in La 2 O 3 can result in more moisture-resistant gate dielectric with smoother surface, resulting in larger pentacene grains grown and thus <b>higher</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>mobility</b> for the OTFT.

40|$|The <b>carrier</b> <b>mobility</b> of {{pentacene}} {{thin-film transistor}} is studied by passivating {{the surface of}} its SiO 2 gate dielectric in NH 3 at different temperatures, namely, 900, 1000, 1100, and 1150 °C. Measurements demonstrate that the higher the annealing temperature, the <b>higher</b> the <b>carrier</b> <b>mobility</b> of the OTFT is. The device annealed at 1150 °C has a field-effect mobility of 0. 74 cm 2 /V s, which is 35 % {{higher than that of}} the device annealed at 900 °C. Energy-dispersive x-ray analysis, scanning-electron microscopy, and atomic-force microscopy show that the <b>higher</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>mobility</b> should be due to more nitrogen incorporated at the gate-dielectric surface which results in more passivated dielectric surface and larger pentacene grains for carrier transport. © 2008 American Institute of Physics. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|By the first-principles {{electronic}} structure calculations, we have systematically studied the {{electronic structure}}s of recently discovered extremely large magnetoresistance (XMR) materials LaSb and LaBi. We find that both LaSb and LaBi are semimetals with the electron and hole carriers in perfect balance.

For example, graphene has a very <b>high</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>mobility,</b> and accompanying lower losses through the Joule effect. But graphene has zero bandgap, which results in a disqualifyingly low on/off ratio in transistor applications.
