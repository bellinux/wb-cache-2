He is thus {{not to be}} {{confused}} with his nephew, and fellow member of the House of Savoy, Count Boniface of Savoy, the son of Amadeus IV. The elder Boniface was born about 1207 in Savoy. He was the eleventh child of his parents. Some sources state that at a young age he joined the Carthusian Order. However, there is no evidence of this, and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> unusual for a nobleman to enter that order with its very strict discipline. He also had a brother Peter of Savoy who was named Earl of Richmond in 1240 and yet another brother William of Savoy, who was Bishop of Valence and a candidate to be Bishop of Winchester in England.|$|E
5|$|The {{injustice}} {{which has}} been done to our author's works, in estimating their poetical merit, rendered us doubly anxious, on opening his last volume, to find it likely to seize fast hold of general sympathy, and thus turn an overwhelming power against the paltry traducers of talent, more eminently promising in many respects, than any the present age has been called upon to encourage. We have not found it to be quite all that we wished in this respect--and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> extraordinary if we had, for our wishes went far beyond reasonable expectations. But we have found it of a nature to present to common understandings the poetical power with which the author's mind is gifted, in a more tangible and intelligible shape than that in which it has appeared in any of his former compositions. It is, therefore, calculated to throw shame on the lying, vulgar spirit, in which this young worshipper in the temple of the Muses has been cried-down; whatever questions may still leave to be settled as to the kind and degree of his poetical merits. Take for instance, as proof of the justice of our praise, the following passage from an Ode to the Nightingale:--it is distinct, noble, pathetic, and true: the thoughts have all chords of direct communication with naturally-constituted hearts: the echoes of the strain linger bout the depths of human bosoms.|$|E

Certain sectors of the community were against the restrictions and the support from elders gave the MWRC campaign the legitimacy it needed in enduring strong criticism. In the face of fierce opposition from some members of her community who had a vested interest in the sale of alcohol, Oscar stood firm. She knew the restrictions would give her people much needed relief from the trauma and chaos caused by alcohol abuse.|$|E
500|$|In its place, Stevens {{suggests}} that determining whether an intervention is a throffer depends {{not on the}} desirability of compliance and noncompliance {{when compared to the}} norm, but on the desirability of the actions entailed in compliance or noncompliance when compared with what their desirability <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> were no intervention made. He proposes that a throffer is made if P attempts to encourage Q to do A by increasing [...] "the desirability to Q of Q doing A relative to what <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> if P made no proposal and decrease the desirability to Q of Q doing not-A relative to what <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> if P made no proposal".

500|$|The RAAF {{was highly}} {{satisfied}} {{with the performance of}} the F-4Es, and they {{played an important role in}} preparing No.82 Wing to operate the F-111. Many personnel in the Air Force believed that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> difficult for the wing to have transitioned directly from the Canberra to the much more complicated F-111. In particular, the Phantoms gave RAAF personnel experience operating aircraft fitted with sophisticated avionics and capable of using a wide range of weapons, and the intensive training program undertaken by No.82 Wing during this period significantly improved its professionalism. In his book Going Solo: The Royal Australian Air Force 1946–1971, Alan Stephens also argued that the speed with which the Air Force's aircrew and technical personnel adapted to operating Phantoms [...] "illustrated the RAAF's exceptional technical competence".|$|E

500|$|Due to {{unforeseen}} scheduling {{problems with}} Shaft, production {{for the series}} was postponed for three years following the completion of its writing. However, once the issues were resolved, production began without any further complications. The animation studio spearheaded the conception and design of the witches in the series, as well as creating each one's individual backstory. Urobuchi had originally envisioned the witches {{to be similar to}} conventional monsters such as Godzilla, but upon seeing the surreal concept art for one of the main witches, Walpurgis Night, he remarked: [...] "How can Homura possibly fight against something like this?" [...] Designers from Shaft also added quotes from the German folklore legend Faust to the series. Throughout production, the animation production team Gekidan Inu Curry had freedom to insert new details or modify existing ones from the original script. An example is during a scene in the final episode where the team added black wings to Homura, something which was not included in Urobuchi's writing. Urobuchi praised this aspect of the production, commenting that [...] "additions by the animation production team added more mystery and depth to [...] characters, and without them, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> difficult to write any further stories {{in the world of the}} series".|$|E

[...] The incidence could be varied from 2 degrees when the flap setting was neutral, to 16 degrees when the flaps were lowered to 60 degrees. [...] The lift coefficient with the wing at this setting was 3.9 (double that of conventional and contemporary aircraft), giving a stalling speed of 57 knots. Since it was intended for carrier use, the wing also folded – a remarkable technical achievement {{in view of the}} small increase in structural weight involved. The undercarriage was a fixed tailwheel type to save complexity. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> challenging to retract the landing gear into the wings.
