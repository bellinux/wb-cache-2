25|$|There {{are certain}} testing {{procedures}} for Hybrid IIIs {{to ensure that}} they obtain a correct humanlike neck flexure, and {{to ensure that they}} would react to a crash in a similar way that human bodies would. Using cadavers for these topics of research is more realistic than using a <b>dummy</b> <b>for</b> physiologic reasons, but it arises many moral dilemmas.|$|E
25|$|The Hybrid III <b>dummy</b> <b>for</b> three-, six- and ten-year olds has its implications, {{and does}} not provide the same {{physical}} outcome a human would encounter with a frontal crash. It was found that when testing the three-year old Hybrid III dummy, it showed that frontal crashes would most likely cause cervical spine injuries. When {{using data from the}} real world, the results did not match up to the Hybrid III stimulation injuries. To get around this, THUMS was created which stands for Total Human Model of Safety. The model can be easily relatable to the human body anatomically especially focusing on the human spine upon impact. Clinical testing and experiments are more accurate than a dummy and more reliable case studies can be implemented with this model. The model is based on a male only, and mimics human tissues and organs. This model is accurate for males in the 50th percentile, and it can not easily relate to three-year olds when dealing with neck and head injuries which are responsible for 57 percent of car crash fatalities. Instead, the FE model can be appropriately implemented for this criteria.|$|E

500|$|The {{model for}} the {{preliminary}} illustrations of Mrs. Tiggy-winkle was Potter's own pet hedgehog. [...] Potter wrote to Warne on 12 November, [...] "Mrs. Tiggy as a model is comical; so long as she can go to sleep on my knee she is delighted, but if she is propped up on end for half an hour, she first begins to yawn pathetically, and then she does bite! Nevertheless, she is a dear person; just like a very fat rather stupid little dog. I think the book will go all right when once started." [...] Three weeks later, she wrote, [...] "The hedgehog drawings are turning out very comical. I have dressed up a cottonwool <b>dummy</b> <b>for</b> convenience of drawing the clothes. It is such a figure of fun." [...] The dummy terrified her rabbit and her pet mouse pulled out the stuffing. [...] "I think it should make a good book," [...] she wrote, [...] "When I have learnt to draw the child." ...|$|E
2500|$|Very little {{attention}} has been paid to obesity and car crash studies, and it is hard to obtain an obese <b>dummy</b> <b>for</b> the experiment. Instead, human cadavers were used. Body weight is a vital factor when it comes to automobile accidents, and body mass is distributed differently in an obese person versus a non-obese person. At the University of Michigan, obese cadavers were tested and compared to non-obese cadavers, and they found that the obese cadavers had more injuries in their lower extremities. The researchers also suggested that an obese person could be protected by their fat almost causing a [...] "cushioning effect." ...|$|E

30|$|Using {{each of the}} {{measures}} of subjective well-being as the dependent variable, I first estimated Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regressions by gender. In the baseline model, I control for the following respondents’ characteristics: age and its square; three <b>dummies</b> <b>for</b> race/ethnicity; five education dummies; number of disabilities 7; an immigrant dummy; number of children; a metropolitan status dummy; two season dummies; a holiday dummy; six <b>dummies</b> <b>for</b> {{the days of the}} week; year dummies; <b>dummies</b> <b>for</b> the DWS year; and state dummies. When the responses to the Cantril ladder or self-rated health status are used as the dependent variable, I exclude a holiday dummy, and six <b>dummies</b> <b>for</b> the days of the week. 8 Then, in another set of analyses, I additionally included independent variables that are likely to have been affected by the incident of job displacement: two marital-status dummies; two employment-status dummies; and four <b>dummies</b> <b>for</b> family income during the last 12  months as of the last CPS interview date 9 (Charles and Stephens 2004; Doiron and Mendolia 2012; Eliason 2012; Jacobson et al. 1993; Stevens 1997). These additional analyses would sort out whether the link between job displacement and subjective well-being is only through the changes of employment status, marital status, and income or through other mechanisms beyond the changes in employment, marital status and income.|$|R
