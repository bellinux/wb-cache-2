VolkerRail were responsible for track installation in both on and off street allowing them to use the <b>embedded</b> <b>rail</b> products of their subsidiary company ALH Rail Coatings. They completed 7.5 km of on street track and 15.4 km of off street track, of many various types, from ballasted track to direct fix track.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{a function}} integrated track system {{that focuses on}} the reduction of acoustic emissions from railway lines. It is shown that the combination of an <b>embedded</b> <b>rail</b> system (ERS), a sound absorbing track surface, and an integrated mini sound barrier has significant acoustic advantages compared to a standard ballast superstructure. The acoustic advantages of an <b>embedded</b> <b>rail</b> system are particularly pronounced in the case of railway bridges. Finally, it is shown that an ERS with track integrated vibration sensors may be used as an early warning system and for monitoring the structural health of the railway infrastructure...|$|E
40|$|Engineering {{methods for}} {{modelling}} {{the generation of}} railway rolling noise are well established. However, these necessarily involve some simplifying assumptions to calculate the sound powers radiated by the wheel and the track. For the rail, this involves using an average vibration together with a radiation efficiency determined for a two-dimensional (2 D) problem. In this paper, the sound radiation from a rail is calculated using a method based {{on a combination of}} waveguide finite elements and wavenumber boundary elements. This new method allows a number of the simplifying assumptions in the established methods to be avoided. It takes advantage of the 2 D geometry of a rail to provide an efficient numerical approach but nevertheless takes into account the three-dimensional nature of the vibration and sound field and the infinite extent of the rail. The approach is used to study a conventional ‘open’ rail as well as an embedded tram rail of the type used for street running. In the former case it is shown that the conventional approach gives correct results and the complexity of the new method is mostly not necessary. However, for the <b>embedded</b> <b>rail</b> it is found {{that it is important to}} take into account the radiation from several wave types in the rail and embedding material. The damping effect of the embedding material on the rail vibration is directly taken into account and, for the example shown, causes the <b>embedded</b> <b>rail</b> to radiate less sound than the open rail above about 600 Hz. The free surface of the embedding material amplifies the sound radiation at some frequencies, while at other frequencies it moves out of phase with the rail and reduces the radiation efficiency. At low frequencies the radiation from the <b>embedded</b> <b>rail</b> resembles a line monopole source which produces greater power than the ‘open’ rail which forms a line dipol...|$|E

25|$|By 2003, {{two-thirds of}} the city's {{streetcar}} tracks were in poor condition as the older track was poorly built using unwelded rail attached to untreated wooden ties lying on loose gravel. The result was street trackage falling apart quickly requiring digging up everything after 10–15 years. Thus, the TTC started to rebuild tracks using a different technique. With the new technique, concrete is poured over compacted gravel, and the ties are placed in another bed of concrete, which is topped by more concrete to <b>embed</b> <b>rail</b> clips and rubber-encased rails. The resulting rail is more stable and quieter with less vibration. The new tracks are expected to last 25 years after which only the top concrete layer needs to be removed in order to replace worn rails.|$|R

40|$|Vibrations and {{structure}} borne noise due to train transit in underground railways {{is still one}} of the major technical issues for both network operators and companies involved in track engineering and construction. Various kind of ballastless track systems are often installed in tunnels of urban mass transit systems to reduce vibrations {{and structure}} borne noise [1]. This paper deals with an innovative embedded-rail track system which is designed for combining the advantages of improved vibration attenuation with those of reduced maintenance costs. An integrated approach to support the system design is illustrated, which consists in 2 D modelling, finite element analysis, lab tests and time-domain numerical simulation of train-track dynamic interaction. In particular, starting from the results of smallscale lab tests for system dynamic characterization, a multi-axial rheologic model of the <b>embedded</b> <b>rail</b> has been identified. This model has then been implemented into the simulation code for train-track dynamic interaction, thus allowing to accurately estimate both the quasi-static and dynamic performances of the <b>embedded</b> <b>rail</b> track system. Experimental tests on a test section of the considered innovative embedded-rail track system have been carried out showing that the developed integrated approach was able to correctly predict both the static and dynamic behavior of the system during train transit in terms of gauge widening and vertical rail deflection...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{several steps}} of a procedure for design of a railway track aiming at the development of optimal track structures under various predefined service and environmental conditions. The structural behavior of the track is analyzed using a finite element model in which the track and a moving train are incorporated. Parameters of the optimum track are determined by applying a numerical optimization technique. The optimization method employed here uses Mutipoint Approximations based on Response Surface fitting (MARS). To demonstrate the robustness of the procedure, it is applied to a problem of optimal design of an innovative railway track for high-speed trains - a so-called <b>Embedded</b> <b>Rail</b> Structure. Requirements for the optimal design {{are related to the}} wear of the rails and wheels and the level of acoustic noise produced by a moving train. To obtain the optimal design, component dimensions and mechanica properties of the track are varied. Results of the optimization are presented and discussed.

40|$|An {{approach}} of {{life cycle cost}} analysis (LCCA) for high-speed ballastless tracks in Spain is carried out in this document based on an approximation of the present value behaviour through the Electre II Multi criteria method. A review of other LCC researches has been done analysing their results in order to adapt previous experimental tracks costs to the present study which is focused on construction and maintenance costs in Spain. Even though several ballastless systems are introduced and analysed in terms of costs, and environmental impacts; only four of them are deeply compared with ballasted tracks: Japanese Shinkansen, Rheda 2000, EDILON <b>embedded</b> <b>rail</b> system and LVT. The comparisons are established using ratios (ballastless/ballasted track costs) instead of total costs due to their lack of validation among countries and years. Furthermore, two case studies have been presented: one using 3 % as discount rate which favours ballastless choice and another using 6 % which in contrast, favours the traditional option.

It is slower by 9. 7 % of target 42 shifts.

With the coming of new types of superstructures, i. e. ballastless track, combined with a new field of application, ii. e. high speed lines, the empirical design method is no longer applicable. The use of computer models which predict the dynamic behaviour of the track and the vehicle have become necessary for designing this kind of track to ensure a save and trouble free exploitation.

The frequency response functions and the distance damping as well as the accelerations of a simplified vehicle are determined and compared. Furthermore a simulation of a complete Thalys high speed train running at high speed over the ERC is made giving information on the dynamic behaviour of the track and the comfort level for the passengers, the latter determined as acceleration levels in the vehicle.

30|$|Asphalt trackbeds {{have already}} been used internationally with great acceptance, while the asphalt layer in railway {{substructures}} is not placed in the same position. Momoya [1, 2] introduced a new performance-based design method and considered {{the effects of the}} number of passing trains on the fatigue of asphalt mixture layer. Teixeira et al. [3] presented bituminous track design and found that structural performance was good when a 12 -cm to 14 -cm conventional bituminous subballast layer was used in lieu of the usual granular layers. In Italy, more than 1, 200  km high-speed lines have been equipped with asphalt sub-ballast layer since 1970 s [3]. Huurman et al. [4] investigated the possibilities of <b>embedded</b> <b>rail</b> in asphalt (ERIA) and used cement-filled, porous asphalt as the bitumen-bound alternative for cement-bound concrete. In US, two methods have been used to incorporate hot mix asphalt (HMA) in railroad trackbeds [5]. One method is to place the HMA on the top of subgrade and the ties directly on the asphalt mat, which is called overlayment. Another method used more often is called underlayment referring to the asphalt mat placed under the ballast to serve as subballast. A program KENTRACK was developed for the asphalt trackbed design [6]. In China, because the Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) has been the fundamental material in high-speed rails since the 1990 s [7], very few related research were referred.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{procedure}} for the numerical simulation of train-bridge interaction is described. This {{is based on}} a finite element schematisation of the bridge (and possibly of the track) and on a multi-body schematisation of the railway vehicles. Wheel-rail contact forces are defined using a non-linear contact model which accounts for the main non-linear effects related to wheel-rail contact forces. The numerical procedure considers train-bridge interaction in both the vertical and horizontal plane. With reference to train ride safety and passenger comfort, the dynamic interaction model allows the analysis of the effect of global and local structure deformations on vehicle dynamics. When dealing with long span suspension bridges, in addition to the limits regarding global deformations during train passage, the structure must satisfy restrictive requirements concerning the effect on rail vehicle dynamics produced by structure deformations under wind loads. An example of numerical simulation for the case of an ETR 500 train crossing the Messina bridge at the maximum design speed, in the presence of extreme transversal wind conditions was reported. Another interesting example of global interaction analysis is that involving the identification of critical velocity phenomena. The train transit over a bridge generates a periodic excitation whose fundamental frequency depends on the speed and on the distance end-to-end between the coaches; as a consequence, resonance occurs if one of the excitation frequencies approaches one of the bridge's natural frequencies. While this phenomenon is generally negligible in long span bridges, it is particularly interesting for smaller bridges, like the bow-arch bridge considered in the paper as the second case study. Local interaction phenomena involve bridge and track deformations having a scale much smaller than that of the complete bridge. Although being of small entity, local deformations play a key role with respect to the cyclic dynamic stresses induced in the bridge structural elements by repeated train passages and the generation of structural noise and vibrations. One key issue is the design of the track system. An example is presented referring to the comparison of two design alternatives for the Messina bridge track system: a conventional design with rails resting on timber sleepers and an innovative <b>embedded</b> <b>rail</b> system. The analysis was performed by comparing the two design solutions in terms of forces and vibrations locally transmitted to the deck. A numerical-experimental comparison is reported {{at the end of the}} paper, which refers to the measurements taken on a bow-arch bridge on the Milano-Torino high speed line, crossed by a test train at the maximum speed of 280 km/h. The comparison demonstrates the reliability of the developed train-bridge interaction model in reproducing both bridge accelerations and stresses...|$|E

Unfortunately, IRJs exhibit several failure modes due to complex interaction between their components, the load spectra and the support conditions. A novel idea of simplifying {{the design of the}} IRJs consisting of only two pieces of insulated <b>rails</b> <b>embedded</b> into a concrete sleeper {{in such a way that}} the free ends of the rails at the gap attain stiffness commensurate to that of the current designs where the gapped rails are connected with two joint bars (also known as fishplates) one on each side of the rail web with the assembly resting on top of sleepers. The advantages of the new design are that it exhibits stability levels comparable to the current designs with fewer components and hence fewer failure modes. A multi-objective optimisation framework was used for the development of the new design that enables safe passage of train wheels across the gap between the <b>rails</b> <b>embedded</b> in concrete sleepers. Feasibility of the sleeper <b>embedded</b> gapped insulated <b>rails</b> under traffic loading is demonstrated through a dynamic analysis of a rail wheel rolling on top of a selected optimal design from the Pareto front.
