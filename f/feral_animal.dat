5|$|The Boreray, {{also known}} as the Boreray Blackface or Hebridean Blackface, is a breed of sheep {{originating}} on the St Kilda archipelago off the west coast of Scotland and surviving as a <b>feral</b> <b>animal</b> on one of the islands, Boreray.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{threat to}} the {{ecosystem}} is grazing by feral sheep (Ovis aries), cattle (Bos primigenius), and goats (Capra hircus) introduced to the island in the late 18th century. <b>Feral</b> <b>animal</b> competition with commercial grazing was severe enough that a program to eradicate them existed {{as far back as}} the late 1920s, and continued through to 1949. One of the results of this grazing was the increased prevalence of herbaceous and woody plants, both endemic and introduced, that were resistant to browsing. The feral animals were almost eradicated, and numbered a few hundred in the 1950s. However, an influx of local hunters led to the feral species being valued as game animals, and in 1959 the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, the governing body in charge of conservation and land use management, changed its policy to a sustained-control program designed to facilitate the sport.|$|E
2500|$|Bakshi's {{unwillingness to}} use {{anthropomorphic}} characters that behaved like feral animals {{led him to}} rewrite a scene in [...] "Fritz Bugs Out" [...] where Duke saves Fritz's life by flying while holding Fritz; in the film, Duke grabs a railing before the car crashes into the river, a solution that Bakshi wasn't entirely satisfied with, but prevented him from having to use any <b>feral</b> <b>animal</b> behavior in that scene.|$|E
25|$|Very little on-ground {{management}} of <b>feral</b> <b>animals</b> {{is done on}} the unallocated crown land. There is some {{management of}} <b>feral</b> <b>animals</b> on reserves and pastoral leases, which includes baiting, trapping, shooting and fencing.|$|R
50|$|The Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (SSAA) {{acknowledges}} the ISC as a non-radical fringe group {{with an initial}} focus of being a general anti-invasive species lobby group. In 2009, however, they questioned {{the direction of the}} ISC which they claimed was taking on an anti-hunting stance, even of <b>feral</b> <b>animals.</b> They ascribe this direction to the appointment of Carol Booth as an ISC policy officer, who SSAA claim has a history of anti-hunting positioning. The SSAA believe that the appropriate hunting of <b>feral</b> <b>animals</b> is a suitable tool in the fight against invasive <b>feral</b> <b>animals.</b>|$|R

2500|$|The {{original}} screenplay consisted {{mostly of}} dialog and featured {{only a few}} changes from Crumb's stories. The script and storyboards went largely unused {{in favor of more}} experimental storytelling techniques. Bakshi said, [...] "I don't like to jump ahead on my films. The way you feel about a film on Day One, you may not feel the same way forty weeks down the road. Characters grow, so I wanted to have the option to change things, and strengthen my characters... It was sort of a stream of consciousness, and a learning process for myself." [...] Bakshi wrote the characters without <b>feral</b> <b>animal</b> behavior to lend the material greater realism.|$|E
2500|$|During {{events in}} Aliens on the LV-426 colony, in Alien Resurrection on the USM Auriga {{and in the}} {{crossover}} movie Alien vs Predator, the species displayed observational learning and problem solving skills, and in the former two cases the Aliens learn how to operate machinery at a very basic level. On LV-426, {{they were able to}} cut power in a section of the complex {{to gain access to the}} humans, and the Alien Queen learns to board an elevator by observing Ripley and Newt escaping in the one beside it. The novelization of the film notes that the queen establishing her [...] "nest" [...] at the base's main power plant could have been chosen either for the <b>feral,</b> <b>animal</b> reason of the warmth that it would provide or for the rational reason of selecting a location where any attackers would be unable to destroy her without destroying the entire facility. In the director's commentary for Aliens, James Cameron noted that the creatures in Aliens had been alive for far longer than the Alien in the original, and had more time to learn about their environment. On the USM Auriga in Alien Resurrection, the Aliens kill one of their own, using its blood to melt through their enclosure and escape; in Alien vs. Predator, they use a similar strategy to free the queen from her chains. An Alien also uses acid spurting from its severed tail as an improvised weapon, indicating they are fully aware of the effects of their acid blood.|$|E

40|$|Projects {{to restore}} nature inevitably disrupt {{the plants and}} animals that inhabit the land to be restored. This essay {{addresses}} the significance of <b>feral</b> <b>animals.</b> Can <b>feral</b> <b>animals</b> remain in a restored nature? I argue that an answer depends on {{what we mean by}} nature and restoration. I present several different conceptions of nature and discuss what their differences mean for the goals of restoration. While the presence of <b>feral</b> <b>animals</b> is not compatible with the dualist conception of nature as that which is untouched by humans, other conceptions are more accommodating. Restoration to a benchmark of nature prior to human impact is both practically and conceptually implausible, thus more analysis is needed of alternative conceptions and their impacts on domesticated and <b>feral</b> plants and <b>animals...</b>|$|R

50|$|According to {{dictionary}} definitions a <b>feral</b> <b>animal</b> is {{one that}} has itself escaped from a domestic or captive status and is living more or less as a wild animal, or one that is descended from such animals. Other definitions define a <b>feral</b> <b>animal</b> as one that has changed from being domesticated to being wild, natural, or untamed. Some common examples of animals with feral populations are horses, dogs, goats, cats, and pigs.|$|E

Feral pigs Sus scrofa are being managed through on-going trapping, baiting and photo monitoring to reduce threats to species such as eastern bristlebirds, long-nosed potoroos and black-breasted button-quails.

500|$|Three endemic {{passerine}} subspecies are the Lord Howe golden whistler, Lord Howe silvereye and Lord Howe currawong [...] The iconic endemic rail, the flightless Lord Howe woodhen, is {{the only}} surviving member of its genus: its ancestors could fly but with no predators and plenty of food on the island this ability was lost. This made it easy prey for islanders and <b>feral</b> <b>animals</b> and by the 1970s the population was less than 30 birds. From 1978 to 1984 <b>feral</b> <b>animals</b> were removed and birds raised in captivity to be successfully reintroduced to the wild. The population is now relatively safe and stable.|$|R
