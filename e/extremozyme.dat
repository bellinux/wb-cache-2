The intrinsic properties of microbial enzymes e. g. consistency, reproducibility and high yields along with many others, has pushed their introduction into a wide range of products and industrial processes. Extremophilic microorganisms represent an underutilized and innovative source of novel enzymes. These microorganisms have developed unique mechanisms and molecular means to cope with extreme temperatures, acidic and basic pH, high salinity, high radiation, low water activity, and high metal concentrations among other environmental conditions. Extremophile derived enzymes, or <b>extremozymes,</b> are able to catalyze chemical reactions under harsh conditions, like those found in industrial processes, which were previously not thought to be conducive for enzymatic activity. Due to their optimal activity and stability under extreme conditions, <b>extremozymes</b> offer new catalytic alternatives for current industrial applications.

Many advances in industrial biocatalysis have been achieved in recent years, however, the potential of biocatalysis through the use of <b>extremozymes</b> is far from being fully realized. In this article, the adaptations and significance of psychrophilic, thermophilic and hyperthermophilic enzymes, and their applications in selected industrial markets will be reviewed.

40|$|Extremophiles are bizarre {{microorganisms}} {{that can}} grow and thrive in extreme environments, which were formerly considered too hostile to support life. The extreme conditions may be {{high or low}} temperature, high or low pH, high salinity, high metal concentrations, very low nutrient content, very low water activity, high radiation, high pressure and low oxygen tension. Some extremophiles are subject to multiple stress conditions. Extremophiles are structurally adapted {{at the molecular level}} to withstand these harsh conditions. The biocatalysts, called <b>extremozymes,</b> produced by these microorganisms, are proteins that function under extreme conditions. Due to their extreme stability, <b>extremozymes</b> offer new opportunities for biocatalysis and biotransformation. Examples of <b>extremozymes</b> include cellulases, amylases, xylanases, proteases, pectinases, keratinases, lipases, esterases, catalases, peroxidases and phytases, which have great potential for application in various biotechnological processes.

Important parameters such as carbon sources and salt concentration for lipase production were investigated. Optimal {{conditions for the}} enzyme production from Haloarcula hispanica 2 TK 2 were determined. It was observed that the lipolytic activity of Haloarcula hispanica was stimulated {{by some of the}} carbon sources. The high lipase acitivity values were obtained in the presence of 2 % (v/v) walnut oil (6. 16 U/ml), 1 % (v/v) fish oil (5. 07 U/ml), 1 % (v/v) olive oil (4. 52 U/ml) and 1 % (w/v) stearic acid (4. 88 U/ml) at 4 M NaCl concentration. Lipase was partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and ultrafiltration. Optimal temperature and pH values were determined as 45 °C and 8. 0, respectively. Lipase activity decreased with the increasing salt concentration, but 85 % activity of the enzyme was maintained at 5 M NaCl concentration. The enzyme preserved 41 % of its relative activity at 90 °C. The partially purified lipase maintained its activity in the presence of surfactants such as Triton X- 100 and SDS.

30|$|Laccases have mainly been {{explored}} from fungal sources for their various applications, especially towards the lignin depolymerization. However, {{the potential of}} fungal laccases are limited by the metabolic pH and salt intolerance. Generally, the fungal laccases are known with their optimum activity between pH  2.0 - 4.0, that {{can be attributed to}} their growth adaptation towards acidic pH. Consequently, a need to increase this active pH range for laccase production through molecular engineering is being realized (Torres-Salas et al. 2013). Besides, relatively slow growth is another limitation towards the laccase production from fungal sources. In view of these limitations, laccase production from alternate sources, such as bacteria, is getting attention. Bacteria possess merits in terms of their ability to adapt to extreme physico-chemical conditions and feasibility for amenable recombinant expression (Joseph et al. 2014; Sharma et al. 2007; Sondhi et al. 2014). Industrial scale-up of bacterial laccases is still riddled due to its extracellular location and tolerance to extreme culture conditions. Being an extracellular enzyme, it has to tolerate the adverse environmental conditions pertaining to <b>extremozyme</b> category. To overcome all these limitations {{there is a need for}} identification of novel bacterial strains possessing the ability to produce extremozymes under extreme conditions. The tolerance towards the wide range of pH and temperature is an emblem of microbial strains making them potential candidates for various biotechnological processes.|$|E

Due to their higher stability, <b>extremozymes</b> is attracting interest as biocatalysts in various industrial processes. In this context, carbohydrate-active <b>extremozymes</b> {{can be used in}} various processes relevant to the paper, food and feed industry. In this thesis, the crystal structure, biochemical characterization and the capacity to synthesize prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) were investigated for a β-glucosidase (HoBGLA) from the halothermophilic bacterium Halothermothrix orenii. The wild-type enzyme displays favorable characteristics for lactose hydrolysis and produces a range of prebiotic GOS, of which β-D-Galp-(1 → 6) -D-Lac and β-D-Galp-(1 → 3) -D-Lac are the major products (Paper I). To further improve GOS synthesis by HoBGLA, rational enzyme engineering was performed (Paper II). Six enzyme variants were generated by replacing strategically positioned active-site residues. Two HoBGLA variants were identified as potentially interesting, F 417 S and F 417 Y. The former appears to synthesize one particular GOS product in higher yield, whereas the latter produces a higher yield of total GOS. In Paper III, the high-resolution crystal structure and biochemical characterization of a hemicellulase (HoAraf 43) from  H. orenii is presented.  HoAraf 43 folds as a five-bladed β-propeller and displays α-Larabinofuranosidase activity. The melting temperature of  HoAraf 43 increases significantly in the presence of high salt and divalent cations, which is consistent with H. orenii being a halophile. Furthermore, the crystal structures of a thermostable tetrameric pyranose 2 -oxidase from Phanerochaete chrysosporium (PcP 2 O) were determined to investigate the structural determinants of thermostability (Paper IV). PcP 2 O has an increased number of salt links between subunits, which may provide a mechanism for increased stability. The structures also imply that the N-terminal region acts as an intramolecular chaperone during homotetramer assembly. QC 20150429 </p...|$|R

Based on their hydrolytic potential 5 isolates were selected and they were Bacillus tequilensis (VCB 1, VCB 2 and VSDB 4), and B. licheniformis (KBFB 2 and KBFB 3). Cellulolytic activity assayed by growth under submerged fermentation showed that B. tequilensis VCB 1 had maximum FPA activity (3.38  IU ml− 1) in 48  h, while B. licheniformis KBFB 3 excelled for endoglucanase (EGA of 4.81  IU ml− 1 in 24  h) and cellobiase (0.71  IU ml− 1 in 48  h) activities. Among all the thermophilic biocatalysts evaluated, highest exoglucanase (0.06  IU ml− 1) activity was observed in B. tequilensis VSDB 4 while endoglucanase of B. licheniformis KBFB 3 showed optimum specific activity at pH 7 and 70  °C. Further, the presence of celS, celB and xlnB genes in the isolates suggest their possible role in biomass conversion. Protein profiling by SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that cellulase isoforms migrated with molecular masses of 75  kDa. The endoglucanase activity of promising strain B. licheniformis KBFB 3 was enhanced in the presence of Ca 2 +, mercaptoethanol and sodium hypochlorite whereas moderately inhibited by Cu 2 +, Zn 2 +, urea, SDS and H 2 O 2.

However, the {{narrow range of}} stability {{of the majority of}} described biocatalysts limits their use for many applications. To overcome these restrictions, <b>extremozymes</b> derived from microorganisms thriving under harsh conditions can be used. Extremophiles living in high salinity are especially interesting as they operate at low water activity, which is similar to conditions used in standard chemical applications. Because only about 0. 1 % of all microorganisms can be cultured, the traditional way of culture-based enzyme function determination needs to be overcome. The rise of high-throughput next-generation-sequencing technologies allows for deep insight into nature’s variety. Single amplified genomes (SAGs) specifically allow for whole genome assemblies from small sample volumes with low cell yields, as are typical for extreme environments. Although these technologies have been available for years, the expected boost in biotechnology has held off. One of the main reasons is the lack of reliable functional annotation of the genomic data, which is caused by the low amount (0. 15 %) of experimentally described genes. Here, we present a novel annotation algorithm, designed to annotate the enzymatic function of genomes from microorganisms with low homologies to described microorganisms. The algorithm was established on SAGs from the extreme environment of selected hypersaline Red Sea brine pools with 4. 3 M salinity and temperatures up to 68 °C. Additionally, a novel consensus pattern for the identification of γ-carbonic anhydrases was created and applied in the algorithm. To verify the annotation, selected genes were expressed in the hypersaline expression system Halobacterium salinarum. This expression system was established and optimized in a continuously stirred tank reactor, leading to substantially increased cell amounts and protein yields. The resulting gene expression products were assessed for function in vivo and/or in vitro. Our functional evaluation of the tested genes confirmed our annotation algorithm. Our developed strategy offers a general guide for using SAGs as a source of scientific and industrial investigations into “microbial dark matter” and may help to develop new catalysts, applicable for novel reactions in green chemistry...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{efficient}} mining strategies for novel and unique enzymes, meeting the requirements of industrial applications based on enzymatic processes, is a functional metagenomic screening. Especially the successful expression of so-called <b>extremozymes</b> is often limited in standard screening hosts, which is particularly true for archaeal enzymes. However, due to the (hyper) thermophilic life style of many representatives and their unique metabolism encompassing many unusual pathways and enzymes, Archaea represent a highly valuable source for novel biocatalysts with exceptional catalytic properties and high stability under harsh conditions. These characteristics are advantageous for many industrial applications. The development of an archaeal expression host is, therefore, highly desirable to enable the identification of new <b>extremozymes</b> and the exploitation of their great potential for industrial applications, which would otherwise remain undetected. The establishment of the genetically tractable (hyper) thermophilic Crenarchaeon S. acidocaldarius as an expression host for functional metagenomic screenings was {{a major part of}} the present work. Heterologous promoter recognition is a prerequisite for functional metagenomic screenings especially of large-insert libraries. Therefore, the promoter selectivity of S. acidocaldarius was investigated via phosphofructokinase (PFK) promoters derived from different (hyper) thermophilic cren- and euryarchaeal as well as bacterial sources using their natively controlled PFK genes as reporters: the crenarchaeal PPi-dependent PFK from Thermoproteus tenax (TTX_ 1277), the euryarchaeal ADP-dependent PFK from Pyrococcus furiosus (PF 1784) and the bacterial ATP-dependent PFK from Thermotoga maritima (TM 0209). The euryarchaeal P. furiosus PFK promoter recognition by S. acidocaldarius as well as the heterologous expression of all three PFKs under the control of the frequently applied S. acidocaldarius malE promoter was successfully shown using the vector pSVA 1450. These results indicate the suitability of S. acidocaldarius as a host for functional screening of large-insert metagenomic libraries as well as heterologous protein (over) expression. Furthermore, S. acidocaldarius utilizes a branched Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway for glucose degradation and the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway for gluconeogenesis. Hence, the successful heterologous expression of a PFK now enables first steps towards metabolic engineering, i. e. directing the EMP-pathway into a glycolytic direction, since a PFK homolog is missing in the S. acidocaldarius genome. The expression capabilities of S. acidocaldarius were further analyzed via esterase genes functionally identified from different metagenomes. The six selected esterases showed a diverse range of characteristics with regard to origin, temperature optima, and substrate specificity. Since the S. acidocaldarius MW 001 exhibited esterase activity towards short-chain acyl esters (i. e. ρNP-C 4 and ρNP-C 8), an esterase deficient S. acidocaldarius strain (MW 001 Δ 1105 Δ 1116) was successfully constructed by deleting the identified esterase genes Saci_ 1105 and Saci_ 1116 allowing for metagenomic esterase screenings. The applicability of pSVA 1450 in metagenomic screenings is rather limited. Therefore, the vector was further improved by inserting additional restriction sites and a N-terminal Strep- 10 xHis-tag, discarding the pre-cloning step via pMZ 1, yielding the vector pSVA 2301. Nevertheless, this did not result in the expected functional expression of the metagenomic esterases under various expression conditions even though the transcription of the genes was proven by mRNA analysis. The esterases Saci_ 1105 and Saci_ 1116 were also subjected to recombinant expression in E. coli for further characterization. Initial biochemical studies revealed a pH optimum at pH 6. 5 for Saci_ 1105. This corresponds to the intracellular pH of S. acidocaldarius, thus suggesting Saci_ 1105 being an intracellular esterase. Its substrate dependency followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a catalytic efficiency kcat/Km of 365 s- 1 ∙mM- 1 and a Km value of 0. 6 mM for the substrate ρNP-C 4. For glucose degradation the branched ED-pathway is the most abundant ED-pathway variant in Archaea, which is comprised of a semiphosphorylative-ED branch and a nonphosphorylative-ED branch. In Sulfolobus spp. this branched ED pathway is promiscuous for the breakdown of glucose as well as galactose. Two glucose dehydrogenases (GDH), the first pathway enzyme, have been characterized for S. solfataricus: GDH- 1 (SSO 3003) exhibits a broad substrate spectrum whereas GDH- 2 (SSO 3204) appears to be glucose-specific. Structure modeling revealed differences in residues within the active site, discussed to be involved in substrate binding. The second major part of the present work aimed for the elucidation of the structural determinants conferring the different substrate specificity. For this, GDH- 2 mutants were constructed via site-directed mutagenesis, substituting amino acids found in corresponding positions to the substrate binding residues in GDH- 1 : GDH- 2 _V 93 N, GDH- 2 _E 294 H and the double mutant GDH- 2 _V 93 N_E 294 H. Biochemical characterization revealed the E 294 H mutation having a lower impact on substrate utilization for most tested substrates compared to the V 93 N and V 93 N_E 294 H mutation. The V 93 N mutation showed mainly an increase of Km with a simultaneous decrease of Vmax or even an abolished enzyme activity, suggesting the residue in this position is playing an important role not only for substrate binding, but also e. g. for active site architecture and/or dynamics during catalysis. The E 294 H mutation, in contrast, showed primarily an increasing effect on Km for the tested hexoses, whereas the Vmax values were not significantly affected, confirming the proposed interaction with the C 6 -hydroxyl group of the substrate. In accordance with the effects the single mutants caused on activity, the kinetic parameters for the double mutant V 93 N_E 294 H reflect a combination thereof. For this mutant residual activity with dramatically decreased catalytic efficiency was only observed for two substrates, whereas for all other tested substrates the activity was completely abolished. A sequence alignment of six characterized archaeal GDHs revealed a high conservation of residues involved in binding actions within the active site. The presence of four highly conserved and two variable residues involved in substrate binding could be identified...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{interest in the}} development of more competitive biotechnological processes is demanding the development of new downstream strategies to maximize product recovery and foster the economic feasibility and robustness of any desired process. From a biotechnological point of view, lipase production {{is considered one of the}} three most important bioprocesses in terms of enzyme sales. During the last years, lipolytic enzymes applications have been broaden to sectors ranging from the petrochemical, pharmaceutical, food and paper to waste management industries, as a result of a close collaboration between academics and industry (Houde et al., 2004). The interest on triacylglycerol hydrolases or lipases (EC 3. 1. 1. 3) lies in the fact that they play a crucial role in biocatalysis of a plethora of chemical reactions, such as hydrolysis, interesterification, esterification, alcoholysis, acidolysis and aminolysis. Their reputation is built largely on their distinctive features, namely, they are quite stable and active in organic solvents, they do not require cofactors, they exhibit a high degree of chemo-, enantio- and regioselectivity, and they possess a wide range of substrate specificity. These features make these enzymes trade to be a well-known billion dollar business (Jaeger and Reetz, 1998; Hasan et al., 2006). However, there are concerns related to the stability of these enzymes at the operating conditions usually employed in biocatalysis. This problem can be circumvented by using <b>extremozymes,</b> whose naturally developed resistance to drastic reaction conditions (like resistance to denaturalization by chemical agents and by extreme values of temperature, pH and salinity) turns out to be their main appeal. One of the main limitations observed for the industrial implementation of the processes to produce this kind of enzymes lies in the high costs of downstream operations which represent more than 50 - 80 % of the total processing cost. Surprisingly, downstream strategies are usually neglected until a later phase of process development. This is a major reason for increased processing cost and eventually the reason for process implementation failures at real scale (Datar and Rosen, 1990). In this line, one of the bottlenecks faced in this kind of biological process is placed in the recovery of the desired intracellular metabolites, which makes it necessary to apply cell lysis methods. With this purpose, conventional methods fall into two main categories: physical (agitation in the presence of glass and ceramic beads, ultrasonication, high pressure homogenization, cryogenic grinding) and chemical (acid, alkali) (Ulloa et al., 2012). In this sense, another chemical method that can be proposed could be the addition of ionic liquids. These are liquid salts at or close to room temperature that have posed a new inspiration for Green Chemistry. These neoteric solvents have been getting increasing attention from the scientific community and industry not only due to their green potential but also to their unique combination of properties (Earle et al., 2006; Rebelo et al., 2005; Smiglak et al., 2006; Baranyai et al., 2004; Wasserscheid and Welton, 2007). The most distinctive feature of these compounds is their negligible vapour pressure, which may reduce the air pollution with respect to the conventional volatile organic solvents. Due to this, ionic liquids have opened up new fields at the interface of many conventional disciplines such as green chemistry, electrochemistry, analytical chemistry, surface science, catalysis and nanotechnology (Plechkova and Seddon, 2008). Another appealing aspect of ionic liquids lies in their tunability, which eases the existence of a plethora of combinations cation-anion, leading to thousands of new compounds with unknown properties and environmental risks. Due to all these properties, they are already used in extant processes and their production per annum surpasses the tonne magnitude (BASF Patent, 2005; Institute Français Du Pétrole, 2001). In this work, we have exploited their structural modularity to apply them as thermophiles cell wall disruptor, hypothesizing that the variation in polarity or hydrophobicity are crucial to interact with the lipidic bilayer of the cell membranes, even up to a complete solubilization. We have bet in this study in the bacterium Thermus thermophilus HB 27, whose lipolytic enzymes are mostly located intracellularly and attached to membrane. The interest of this new approach is supported by the fact that these enzymes are already being commercialized by top-companies such as Sigma-Aldrich but with very low levels of activity, as a consequence of the low levels of extracellular enzyme expression. First, flask cultures of Thermus thermophilus HB 27 were cultivated for 24 h at 70 °C. Then, six different ionic liquids (C 2 MIMCl, C 6 MIMCl, C 10 MIMCl, C 2 MIMC 2 SO 4, C 2 MIMHSO 4 and C 2 MIM(C 2 H 5) 2 PO 4) were added to the culture medium at concentrations of 1 g/L, and the effect of these molten salts pressure was analyzed by monitoring both the cell growth and the lipolytic enzyme distribution for 6 hours (from 24 to 30 h). The enzyme activity data were obtained from spectrometric measurement of the enzymatic hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl laurate (Deive et al., 2009), and allowed concluding a great lytic effect of C 10 MIMCl, since a drastic increase of the extracellular activity of 308 % was observed, to the detriment of the intracellular and membrane bound enzyme. In parallel, the cell growth was monitored by turbidimetric measurements at 600 nm and showed 43 % of decay, thus confirming the excellent lytic effect provided by the ionic liquid...|$|R
