5|$|Iridium {{is used in}} {{particle}} physics {{for the production of}} antiprotons, a form of antimatter. Antiprotons are made by shooting a high-intensity proton beam at a conversion target, which needs to be made from a very high density material. Although tungsten may be used instead, iridium <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> of better stability under the shock waves induced by the temperature rise due to the incident beam.|$|E
5|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} venography {{employs the}} same principles, but uses MRI as a scanning modality. MRI <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> of being better at detecting {{damage to the}} brain itself {{as a result of}} the increased pressure on the obstructed veins, but it is not readily available in many hospitals and the interpretation may be difficult.|$|E
5|$|Offshore {{wind power}} is {{captured}} by wind turbines placed out at sea; it <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> that wind speeds {{are higher than}} on land, though wind farms are more costly to construct offshore. The first offshore wind farm was installed in Denmark in 1991, and the installed capacity of European offshore wind farms reached 3 GW in 2010.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{concrete}} spacers <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> of <b>the</b> same {{raw material}} which {{will improve the}} watertightness and strength of the concrete. Plastic spacers <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> of <b>the</b> low cost production and fast processing.|$|R

5|$|Plutonium alloys can be {{produced}} by adding a metal to molten plutonium. If the alloying metal is sufficiently reductive, plutonium can be added {{in the form of}} oxides or halides. The δ phase plutonium–gallium and plutonium–aluminium alloys are produced by adding plutonium(III) fluoride to molten gallium or aluminium, which <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> of avoiding dealing directly with the highly reactive plutonium metal.|$|E
5|$|Separation of the 3+ {{actinides}} {{can also}} be achieved by solvent extraction chromatography, using bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (abbreviated as HDEHP) as the stationary organic phase, and nitric acid as the mobile aqueous phase. The actinide elution sequence is reversed {{from that of the}} cation-exchange resin column. The einsteinium separated by this method <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> to be free of organic complexing agent, as compared to the separation using a resin column.|$|E
5|$|The {{ignition}} system {{consisted of two}} rear-mounted, crankshaft-driven magnetos, each supplying one {{of a pair of}} spark plugs fitted to each cylinder. This is common practise for aero engines, as it ensures continued operation {{in the case of a}} single magneto failure, and <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> of more efficient combustion over a single spark plug application.|$|E
50|$|Cavalry <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> of {{improved}} mobility, {{and a man}} fighting from horseback also <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> of greater height, speed, and inertial mass over an opponent on foot.

5|$|Using {{synchrotron}} radiation frequently has specific requirements for X-ray crystallography. The intense ionizing radiation can cause radiation damage to samples, particularly macromolecular crystals. Cryo crystallography protects the sample from radiation damage, by freezing the crystal at liquid nitrogen temperatures (~100 K). However, {{synchrotron radiation}} frequently <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> of user selectable wavelengths, allowing for anomalous scattering experiments which maximizes anomalous signal. This {{is critical in}} experiments such as SAD and MAD.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possible}} way {{to separate the}} trivalent actinides is via solvent extraction chromatography using bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (abbreviated as HDEHP) as the stationary organic phase and nitric acid as the mobile aqueous phase. The actinide elution sequence is reversed {{from that of the}} cation-exchange resin column, so that the heavier actinides elute later. The mendelevium separated by this method <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> of being free of organic complexing agent compared to the resin column; the disadvantage is that mendelevium then elutes very late in the elution sequence, after fermium.|$|E
5|$|Because it {{is lighter}} than air, {{airships}} and balloons are inflated with helium for lift. While hydrogen gas is more buoyant, and escapes permeating through a membrane {{at a lower}} rate, helium <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> of being non-flammable, and indeed fire-retardant. Another minor use is in rocketry, where helium is used as an ullage medium to displace fuel and oxidizers in storage tanks and to condense hydrogen and oxygen to make rocket fuel. It {{is also used to}} purge fuel and oxidizer from ground support equipment prior to launch and to pre-cool liquid hydrogen in space vehicles. For example, the Saturn V rocket used in the Apollo program needed about 370,000m3 (13 million cubic feet) of helium to launch.|$|E

5|$|Bunnies & Burrows <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> of {{offering}} players an intuitive grasp of relative dangers and appropriate actions not possible in game worlds that are substantially fictional. For example, a player is told their character is {{confronted with a}} fox. There is an immediate intuition {{on the amount of}} peril a rabbit is facing. Although player characters are substantially weaker than many of the dangers they face, the game {{is one of the first}} to encourage problem solving and outwitting obstacles, rather than out-fighting them.|$|E
5|$|Compact Linear Fresnel Reflectors are CSP-plants {{which use}} many thin mirror strips instead of {{parabolic}} mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto two tubes with working fluid. This <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> that flat mirrors {{can be used}} which are much cheaper than parabolic mirrors, and that more reflectors can {{be placed in the}} same amount of space, allowing more of the available sunlight to be used. Concentrating linear fresnel reflectors can be used in either large or more compact plants.|$|E
5|$|Flatfish are {{demersal}} fish (bottom-feeding fish) that show {{a greater degree}} of asymmetry than any other vertebrates. The larvae are at first bilaterally symmetrical but they undergo metamorphosis during the course of their development, with one eye migrating {{to the other side of}} the head, and they simultaneously start swimming on their side. This <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> that, when they lie on the seabed, both eyes are on top, giving them a broad field of view. The upper side is usually speckled and mottled for camouflage, while the underside is pale.|$|E

5|$|Nucleic acid {{design has}} similar goals to protein design. In both, the {{sequence}} of monomers is designed to favor the desired target structure and to disfavor other structures. Nucleic acid design <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> of being much computationally easier than protein design, because the simple base pairing rules are sufficient to predict a structure's energetic favorability, and detailed information about the overall three-dimensional folding of the structure is not required. This allows the use of simple heuristic methods that yield experimentally robust designs. Nucleic acid structures are less versatile than proteins in their function because of proteins' increased ability to fold into complex structures, and the limited chemical diversity of the four nucleotides {{as compared to the}} twenty proteinogenic amino acids.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} {{of wind and}} solar PV <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> that the two sources complement each other because the peak operating times for each system occur {{at different times of}} the day and year. The power generation of such solar hybrid power systems is therefore more constant and fluctuates less than each of the two component subsystems. Solar power is seasonal, particularly in northern/southern climates, away from the equator, suggesting a need for long term seasonal storage in a medium such as hydrogen or pumped hydroelectric. The Institute for Solar Energy Supply Technology of the University of Kassel pilot-tested a combined power plant linking solar, wind, biogas and hydrostorage to provide load-following power from renewable sources.|$|E
5|$|A route {{popular with}} {{experienced}} hillwalkers starts at Torlundy, {{a few miles}} north-east of Fort William on the A82 road, and follows the path alongside the Allt a' Mhuilinn. It can also be reached from Glen Nevis by following the Pony Track as far as Lochan Meall an t-Suidhe, then descending slightly to the CIC Hut. The route then ascends Càrn Mòr Dearg and continues along the Càrn Mòr Dearg Arête ("CMD Arête") before climbing steeply to the summit of Ben Nevis. This route involves a total of 1,500 metres of ascent and requires modest scrambling ability and a head for heights. In common with other approaches {{on this side of}} the mountain, it <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> of giving an extensive view of the cliffs of the north face, which are hidden from the Pony Track.|$|E

5|$|DNA walkers are a {{class of}} nucleic acid nanomachines that exhibit {{directional}} motion along a linear track. A large number of schemes have been demonstrated. One strategy is to control {{the motion of the}} walker along the track using control strands that need to be manually added in sequence. Another approach is to make use of restriction enzymes or deoxyribozymes to cleave the strands and cause the walker to move forward, which <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> of running autonomously. A later system could walk upon a two-dimensional surface rather than a linear track, and demonstrated the ability to selectively pick up and move molecular cargo. Additionally, a linear walker has been demonstrated that performs DNA-templated synthesis as the walker advances along the track, allowing autonomous multistep chemical synthesis directed by the walker. The synthetic DNA walkers' function {{is similar to that of}} the proteins dynein and kinesin.|$|E
5|$|Egg-laying (ovipositing) {{involves}} {{not only}} the female darting over floating or waterside vegetation to deposit eggs on a suitable substrate, but also the male hovering above her or continuing to clasp her and flying in tandem. The male attempts to prevent rivals from removing his sperm and inserting their own, something made possible by delayed fertilisation and driven by sexual selection. If successful, a rival male uses his penis to compress or scrape out the sperm inserted previously; this activity takes up {{much of the time}} that a copulating pair remains in the heart posture. Flying in tandem <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> that less effort is needed by the female for flight and more can be expended on egg-laying, and when the female submerges to deposit eggs, the male may help to pull her out of the water.|$|E
5|$|Photochromic lenses include silver halides, so that {{ultraviolet}} light in natural daylight liberates metallic silver, darkening the lenses. The silver halides are reformed in lower light intensities. Colourless silver chloride films {{are used in}} radiation detectors. Zeolite sieves incorporating Ag+ ions are used to desalinate seawater during rescues, using silver ions to precipitate chloride as silver chloride. Silver is also used for its antibacterial properties for water sanitisation, but the application of this is limited by limits on silver consumption. Colloidal silver is similarly used to disinfect closed swimming pools; while it <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> of not giving off a smell like hypochlorite treatments do, colloidal silver is not effective enough for more contaminated open swimming pools. Small silver iodide crystals are used in cloud seeding to cause rain.|$|E
