25|$|A {{proposed}} amendment {{becomes an}} operative {{part of the}} Constitution {{as soon as it}} is ratified by three-fourths of the States (currently 38 of the 50 States).

An example of an allowed label claim: Soluble fiber from foods such as oatmeal, {{as part of a}} diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart disease.

25|$|By a 1936 Act of Congress, the Pueblo of Jemez {{became the}} legal and {{administrative}} representative of the Pueblo of Pecos, which had been privately owned during Kidder’s excavation. As a consequence of The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), which requires federal and other museum facilities to inventory, establish cultural affiliations, and publish <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Register</b> any and all Native American human remains and certain objects in their possession, the Pueblo of Jemez made a formal claim {{on behalf of the}} Pecos people. This repatriation was primarily due to the efforts of William J. Whatley, the Jemez Pueblo tribal archaeologist, who searched through museum records for these remains and artifacts for eight years. The human remains from Kidder’s excavations were returned to the Jemez people in 1999 and ritually reburied at Pecos National Historic Park. In a sense, they rejoined Kidder, as he is buried on a hillside not far away, close to Pecos Pueblo.|$|E
25|$|Bringing science {{into the}} public eye also coincided with the rapid rate at which {{recombinant}} DNA technology entered the industrial world. Because of the practical applications of the technology, funding for research using it started coming more {{from the private sector}} and less from the public sector. In addition, many molecular biologists who once confined themselves to academia, developed ties with private industry as equity owners, corporate executives and consultants. This {{led to the creation of}} a biotechnology industry, although during this time, public debates occur over the hazards of recombinant DNA. These debates were eventually won over by scientists who stated that the hazards were exaggerated and that the research could be conducted safely. Such was seen in the Ascot report, found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Register</b> in March 1978. This report emphasized that the hazards of recombinant DNA to the general community were small to the point that they were of no practical consequence to the general public. For this reason, along with high economic pressures for industrial development and a more supportive political environment that existed after 1979, research and industry based on recombinant DNA continued to expand.|$|E
