5|$|Tom (Aziz Ansari) is {{tasked with}} taking the cover {{photo of the}} summer catalog, and convinces Ann (Rashida Jones) and Mark (Paul Schneider) to pose for photos at a {{community}} park. Tom is repeatedly frustrated with Ann, who has a difficult time appearing happy. When the photos are finished, Ann agrees that she looks miserable and asks that the pictures not be used. Mark appears concerned that Ann's unhappiness {{is a reflection of}} their relationship. She insists everything is fine, but he is unconvinced. Meanwhile, April (Aubrey Plaza) and Andy (Chris Pratt) appear to be growing closer. After helping Leslie set up her picnic, Andy asks whether April wants to get drinks after work, and she agrees. However, when they arrive at a bar, the bouncer (Mike Mauloff) easily notices April is underage, and her identification confirms she is 20. April tells Andy they can <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> bar, but Andy decides to go home instead, seemingly uncomfortable about their age difference. April is visibly disappointed, but does not convey it to Andy. Later, the summer catalogs arrive, with a photo on the cover of April and Andy appearing happy together at the picnic.|$|E

In February 1980, after a perilous three-day voyage across the Gulf of Thailand {{in the hands of}} paid professionals, they arrived at the Lam Sing refugee camp on the coast of Thailand. Among the thousands of refugees who were waiting for sponsorship to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> country, the Ungs waited four months in Lam Sing before they found out that the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Holy Family Church in Essex Junction, Vermont, would be their sponsors. In the middle of June 1980, Loung, Meng, and Eang boarded a plane at Bangkok International Airport and headed for their new home.|$|E
25|$|It was Muzzarelli who conferred upon Goaziou the Degrees of the Scottish Rite {{up to the}} 30th. Muzzarelli named Goaziou {{his deputy}} in early 1907. Unfortunately, the two men fell out over mutual charges of {{financial}} irregularity combined with personal dislike. The Order also was in disarray because too many Lodges had been founded too quickly. The new Order also experienced external pressures, including persecution by the existing Male-Only Orders in the US. In the fall of 1908, Muzzarelli was pressured to call {{what remained of the}} Lodges he founded, just less than half, to a convention in St. Louis, Missouri. Tragically, Muzzarelli, who in addition to pressures in the Order also had many personal problems, committed suicide October 15, 1908. Though Goaziou made it plain he would prefer the presidency <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> Co-Mason, it was Goaziou who took charge of the financial and administrative affairs of the lodges, and who was elected President at the convention in St. Louis.|$|E

25|$|In 1967, NBC {{reached a}} deal with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) to acquire the {{broadcast}} rights to the classic 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. CBS, which had televised the film annually since 1956, refused to meet MGM's increased fee to renew its television rights. Oz had been, up to then, {{one of the few}} programs that CBS had telecast in color. However, by 1967, color broadcasts had become standard on television, and the film simply became another title in the list of specials that NBC telecast in the format. The film's showings on NBC were distinctive as it televised The Wizard of Oz without a hosted introduction, as CBS had long done; it was also slightly edited for time in order to make room to air more commercials. Despite the cuts, however, it continued to score excellent television ratings in those pre-VCR days, as audiences were generally unable to see the film any other way at that time. NBC aired The Wizard of Oz each year from 1968 to 1976, when CBS, realizing that they may have committed a colossal blunder by letting a huge ratings success like Oz <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> network, agreed to pay MGM more money to re-acquire the rights to show the film.|$|E

Kafka chose Mike McCartney of Priority Sports of Chicago as his agent, who also represents Wootton. Priority hired former Chicago Bears quarterback Erik Kramer and a trainer in Phoenix, Arizona, to help Kafka prepare for the NFL Scouting Combine. To prepare for the Combine, Kafka worked out twice a day in Arizona, and held practice sessions with Notre Dame wide receiver Golden Tate. At the Combine, Kafka said, [...] "I {{want to be an}} NFL starter. I'm not going to the league to be a No. 2. I think my whole game can <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> level.

After the meeting, Tracy offers to take Liz back to the studio, but he makes a detour to a strip club in the Bronx. While trying to get home, Liz learns that Jack fired Pete earlier that day. Tracy and Liz arrive at the studio halfway through the live broadcast of the show. Liz sends Tracy out on stage to talk off the last bit of the show, much to The Girlie Show studio audience's delight and Jenna's shock. Backstage, Liz forces Jack to rehire Pete and to promise to guarantee Jenna's job security.|$|E
500|$|While the barnstorming {{tour was}} under way, Ruppert began {{negotiating}} with Boston Braves owner Judge Emil Fuchs, who wanted Ruth as a gate attraction. The Braves had enjoyed modest recent success, finishing {{fourth in the}} National League in both 1933 and 1934, but the team drew poorly at the box office. Unable to afford the rent at Braves Field, Fuchs had considered holding dog races there when the Braves were not at home, only to be turned down by Landis. After a series of phone calls, letters, and meetings, the Yankees traded Ruth to the Braves on February 26, 1935. Ruppert had stated {{that he would not}} release Ruth to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> team as a full-time player. For this reason, it was announced that Ruth would become a team vice president and would be consulted on all club transactions, in addition to playing. He was also made assistant manager to Braves skipper Bill McKechnie. In a long letter to Ruth {{a few days before the}} press conference, Fuchs promised Ruth a share in the Braves' profits, with the possibility of becoming co-owner of the team. Fuchs also raised the possibility of Ruth succeeding McKechnie as manager, perhaps as early as 1936. Ruppert called the deal [...] "the greatest opportunity Ruth ever had".|$|E
500|$|Still, in the World Series against Colorado, he did {{not start}} the team's away games. Francona faced a dilemma when playing without a DH in the NL park of having to bench either Youkilis, 120-RBI man Mike Lowell, or 117-RBI man David Ortiz, as he had to choose from among them which two would play first base and third base. Bob Ryan of The Boston Globe called it [...] "the most {{difficult}} decision any American League manager has had {{to make in the}} 34-year history of the DH". Youkilis said, [...] "It doesn't bother me. I want to play, but I totally understand the situation. Look, I'm doing everything I've always wanted to do. I'm playing in a World Series. I'm playing every day. I'm happy. I just want to win.... If I have to take a seat, that's just the way it has to be." [...] Youkilis hit two doubles (both in Game 1) and had three walks in only 12 plate appearances in the 4-game win over Colorado, as he was not in the starting lineup for the away games. Dismissing questions as to whether he was upset about being benched for the last two games of the World Series, Youkilis said, [...] "Move on and <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> team if you’re worried about your playing time, and think you deserve to play over somebody else." ...|$|E

500|$|The Kinks' next single, [...] "Waterloo Sunset", was {{released}} in May 1967. The lyrics describe two lovers passing over a bridge, with a melancholic observer reflecting on the couple, the Thames and Waterloo station. The song was rumoured to {{have been inspired by}} the romance between two British celebrities of the time, actors Terence Stamp and Julie Christie. Ray Davies denied this in his autobiography, and claimed in a 2008 interview, [...] "It was a fantasy about my sister going off with her boyfriend to a new world {{and they were going to}} emigrate and <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> country." [...] Despite its complex arrangement, the sessions for [...] "Waterloo Sunset" [...] lasted a mere ten hours; Dave Davies later commented on the recording: [...] "We spent a lot of time trying to get a different guitar sound, to get a more unique feel for the record. In the end we used a tape-delay echo, but it sounded new because nobody had done it since the 1950s. I remember Steve Marriott of the Small Faces came up and asked me how we'd got that sound. We were almost trendy for a while." [...] The single was one of the Kinks' biggest UK successes (hitting number two on Melody Makers chart), and went on to become one of their most popular and best-known songs. Pop music journalist Robert Christgau called it [...] "the most beautiful song in the English language", and AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine cited it as [...] "possibly the most beautiful song of the rock and roll era".|$|E
