40|$|Magnetic {{reconnection}} {{is important}} in the magnetic self-organization of plasmas in many diverse fields of physics that include plasmas, magnetic fields, and current systems. It is one of these processes that can transport, generate, and restructure magnetic field, plasma flow, and thermal energy. Nearly all theoretical and experimental work on magnetic reconnection starts with boundary or initial conditions where the state of driven reconnection is the presumed starting point. But in nature and the laboratory the onset of reconnection must be forced naturally by some evolution of plasma mediated forces. How and why the onset of reconnection occurs is commonly recognized as a scientifically urgent question.

40|$|AbstractIt {{has been}} said that, once a bomb casing has fractured, “detonation gases will then stream around the {{fragments}} or bypass them, and the acceleration process stops there. ” However, while apparently copious gas flow through casing fractures indicates some pressure release, {{it is also an}} indication of significant gas <b>drive</b> <b>pressure,</b> post casing fracture. This paper shows two approaches to the problem of calculating the actual loss of drive. One presents first-order analytical calculations, in cylindrical geometry, of pressure loss to the inside surface of a fractured casing. The second shows the modelling of a selected example in the CTH code. Both approaches reveal that gas escape, while occurring at its own sound-speed relative to the adjacent casing fragments, has to compete with rapid radial expansion of the casing. Together with some historic experiments now publicly available, our calculations indicate that post-fracture casing fragment acceleration is, for most systems, unlikely to be reduced significantly...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Scaling of the {{ignition}} energy threshold Eig with the implosion velocity vim and isentrope parameter α of imploding spherical DT shells is investigated by performing one dimensional (1 -D) hydrodynamic simulations of the implosion and hot spot formation dynamics. It is {{found that the}} a and b exponents in the power law approximation Eig ∝ αav−bim depend crucially on the subset of initial configurations chosen to establish the scaling law. When the initial states are generated {{in the same way}} as in the Livermore study (W. K. Levedahl, J. D. Lindl, Nucl. Fusion 37 (1997) 165), the same scaling, Eig ∝ α 1. 7 v− 5. 5 im, is recovered. If, however, the initial states are generated by rescaling the parent configuration according to the hydrodynamic similarity laws, a different scaling is obtained, Eig ∝ α 3. 0 v− 9. 1 im, which is very close to the α 3 v− 10 im dependence predicted by the simple isobaric model for assembled fuel states.

The two most commonly used types of artificial ventilation are Intermittent Positive Pressure Ventilation (IPPV) and High Frequency Jet Ventilation (HFJV). Each of these have advantages and disadvantages and the clinician must balance {{the need to maintain}} an adequate tidal volume for gas exchange against the risks of increasing gas leak through the BPF caused by the higher pressures and volumes which may be required. In this thesis, experiments investigating the effects of HFJV and IPPV on ventilation and leak volumes whilst ventilating various sizes and positions of simulated BPFs are described. A survey was also conducted to gauge the current airway {{management of}} BPFs by specialist anaesthetists in the UK. A bench top model was used to ventilate (HFJV or IPPV) standard artificial ‘test’ lungs and/or cadaveric porcine lungs whilst data were collected (i. e. entrained/expired/leak volumes). Whilst ventilating with HFJV, leak and entrained volumes were shown to increase progressively with more proximally situated BPFs, whereas the measured expired volume decreased.

Three types of plug materials were used at three different test bed lengths (86. 87, 189. 28, and 547. 73  m) to determine the effectiveness of the technology with respect to pipeline length. Erosion rates were determined for each plug type and at each test bed length. Although some correlation was observed between erosion rates and other test parameters, the parameters that directly influenced it were not easily discernible. The unplugging technology was observed to create an amplification of pressure at the plug location which was correlated to the process control parameters (i. e. an increase in drive time for the same <b>drive</b> <b>pressure</b> will increase the amplification factor an increase in suction time will decrease the amplification factor). It was also noted that the cavity size affected the amplification factor and resulting wave speeds.

40|$|In {{the current}} study, the {{influence}} of turbulent mixing and local reaction rates on deflagration to detonation transition (DDT) was investigated using a state-of-the-art large eddy simulation (LES) strategy. Specifically, detonation attenuation by a porous medium, and the subsequent re-initiation for methane-oxygen, a moderately unstable mixture, was considered. The purpose of the investigation was to validate the numerical strategy with previous experimental observations, and to determine what specific roles turbulent mixing and shock compression have on flame acceleration during {{the final stages of}} DDT. The modelling procedure adopted was a grid-within-a-grid approach: The compressible linear eddy model for large eddy simulation (CLEM-LES). It was found that average turbulent fluctuations greater than the laminar flame speed were required in order to maintain wave velocities above the Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) -deflagration velocity threshold, a precursor requirement for DDT to occur. It was also found that sufficient turbulent burning on the flame surface was required in order to <b>drive</b> <b>pressure</b> waves to sufficiently strengthen the leading shock wave, locally, in order to trigger auto-ignition hot spots in the wave front. These local explosion events, which were found to burn out through turbulent surface reactions, drive transverse pressure waves outward. Upon subsequent shock reflections or interactions of the transverse waves, new local explosion events occurred, which further strengthened the adjacent leading shock wave above the CJ-detonation speed. Eventually, through this process, the wave sustained the CJ-detonation speed, on average, through the cyclic mechanism of local explosion events followed by turbulent surface reactions. Finally, combustion of the flame acceleration process was found to lie predominantly within the thin-reaction zones regime. Comment: 36 pages, 14 figure...|$|E
