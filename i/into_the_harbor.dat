5|$|Krasnyi Kavkaz {{continued}} to ferry reinforcements into Sevastopol. During the Kerch-Feodosiya Operation the ship sailed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor</b> of Feodosiya on 29 December 1941, landed reinforcements, and provided gunfire support for Soviet troops already ashore. In early January 1942, she was severely damaged by German dive bombers. She {{made it to}} Novorossiysk, escorted by the destroyer Sposobnyi, where she was patched up enough to make to Poti where more permanent repairs could be made. These took until October 1942 and the opportunity was taken to reinforce her anti-aircraft armament.|$|E
5|$|On 2 July 2015, Queen Mary 2 began a 175th Anniversary Crossing in Southampton. She sailed {{first to}} Liverpool, leaving that city after a {{fireworks}} display on 4 July, the actual anniversary date of Cunard's first transatlantic voyage. Queen Mary 2 followed {{the route of}} the original ship Britannia, calling first at Halifax, Nova Scotia. After a day there, she headed first upriver <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor,</b> using her bow thrusters and swivel-pod motors to negotiate the tight turnaround to come back down close to the cityfront. A 21-gun salute and bagpipe band honored the ship.|$|E

5|$|The {{engagement}} was confusing {{for both}} sides, {{and the view}} was soon obscured by gunpowder smoke. Many ships on both sides were badly damaged, and around 2,000 men killed or wounded. Towards the end, a squadron of Danish ships met up with Dutch and escorted them <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor</b> of Copenhagen. The Swedish fleet had failed; much-needed reinforcements and supplies had reached the beleaguered Danish town. The combined Danish and Dutch fleet now had control of the seas, forcing the Swedish fleet to seek refuge in the harbor of Landskrona on the Swedish mainland.|$|E
5|$|Feth-i Bülend saw action {{during the}} Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, where she battled the Russian steamer Vesta in an {{inconclusive}} engagement. The Ottoman fleet was laid up {{for most of}} the next twenty years, and Feth-i Bülend saw no activity during this period. Modernized in 1890, she was nevertheless still not in condition for active service at the outbreak of the Greco-Turkish War in 1897. She was therefore heavily rebuilt in Germany between 1903 and 1907. At the start of the First Balkan War in 1912, the ship was stationed in Thessaloniki; the ship was disarmed so the guns could be used to strengthen the port's fortifications. On the night of 31 October, a Greek torpedo boat slipped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor</b> and sank Feth-i Bülend, killing seven of her crew.|$|E
5|$|Several notable {{passengers}} sailed on the liner's maiden voyage. Jay Gould II, tennis {{champion and}} grandson of railroad tycoon Jay Gould, sailed for a three-month stay at his Hawaiian home. Also sailing were movie star Laura La Plante and her husband, director William A. Seiter, and, Western Auto founder George Pepperdine, who began a three-month {{tour of the}} Orient with his daughters. On arrival in Honolulu on 10June, City of Honolulu was adorned with flowers and received a welcome from airplanes and a flotilla of outrigger canoes that escorted her <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor.</b> After a ten-day stay in the islands, she departed for Los Angeles, returning there on 26June.|$|E

5|$|Westfalen {{remained}} in Danzig until 31 March, when she departed for Finland with Posen; the ships arrived at Russarö, {{which was the}} outer defense for Hanko, by 3 April. The German army quickly took the port. The task force then proceeded to Helsingfors; on 9 April Westfalen stood off Reval, organizing the invasion force. Two days later the ship passed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor</b> at Helsingfors and landed the soldiers; she supported their advance with her main guns. The Red Guards were defeated within three days. The ship {{remained in}} Helsingfors until 30 April, by which time the White government had been installed firmly in power.|$|E
5|$|When Selvo {{approached}} the city, Guiscard's ships had already {{anchored in the}} harbor at Durazzo. Though the battle was fierce, superior tactics by the skilled Venetian fleet overpowered the inexperienced Normans who were mostly used to land battles. The battered fleet led by Guiscard retreated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor</b> after losing many ships. Victorious at sea, Selvo left the fleet {{under the command of}} his son and returned to Venice a hero. Because of the help given to the Byzantine Empire, the Republic of Venice was awarded a Golden Bull: a decree by Emperor Alexios I Komnenos granting Venice many privileges, including a tax exemption for Venetian merchants, that would be crucial for the future economic and political expansion of Venice in the eastern Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|While the {{superstructure}} {{and two of}} {{the four}} main gun turrets were removed, the barbette of one of the turrets remains visible above the water. Since her sinking, oil still leaks from the hull, with more than 2.3 quarts (2.18l) escaping <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor</b> per day. The Navy, in conjunction with the National Park Service, has recently overseen a comprehensive computerized mapping of the hull, being careful to honor its role as a war grave. The Navy is considering non-intrusive means of abating the continued leakage of oil to avoid the further environmental degradation of the harbor.|$|E

5|$|By October 9, {{all of the}} French and American {{guns were}} in place. Among the American guns there were three twenty-four pounders, three {{eighteen}} pounders, two eight-inch (203mm) howitzers and six mortars, totaling fourteen guns. At 3:00pm, the French guns opened the barrage and drove the British frigate, HMS Guadeloupe across the York River, where she was scuttled to prevent capture. At 5:00pm the Americans opened fire. Washington fired the first gun; {{legend has it that}} this shot smashed into a table where British officers were eating. The Franco-American guns began to tear apart the British defenses. Washington ordered that the guns fire all night so that the British could not make repairs. All of the British guns on the left were soon silenced. The British soldiers began to pitch their tents in their trenches and soldiers began to desert in large numbers. Some British ships were also damaged by cannonballs that flew across the town <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor.</b>|$|E
5|$|Diederichs {{requested}} reinforcements from Germany, and the Kaiser authorized {{a second}} Division to deploy to the East Asia station. The unit was therefore reorganized as the East Asia Squadron; Prinzess Wilhelm {{was assigned to}} the I Division of the Squadron. On 27 November, Diederichs was promoted to Vice Admiral for his success in seizing Kiaochou, and given command of the new Squadron. Chinese forces converged on the port {{by the end of the}} month. Prinzess Wilhelm and Kaiser moved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor</b> to provide artillery support. General Chang, who had been placed under house arrest, was discovered to have been attempting to subvert the German occupation; Dierderichs therefore placed him under arrest aboard Prinzess Wilhelm. A brief skirmish ensued, which quickly resulted in a Chinese rout. On 8 January, a force of 50 men from Prinzess Wilhelms crew was sent to Chi-mo to defend against Chinese raids in the area.|$|E
5|$|During the Kerch-Feodosiya Operation, Krasnyi Krym sailed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor</b> of Feodosiya on 29 December 1941 and disembarked {{reinforcements}} {{and provided}} gunfire support for Soviet troops already ashore. She was hit eleven times by Axis artillery and mortar fire in retaliation. Between 15 and 21 January 1942 she landed {{the bulk of}} the 266th Mountain Regiment at Sudak and reinforced them with 1576 troops of the 544th Rifle Regiment between 23 and 26 January. During the following months Krasnyi Krym brought in reinforcements for the garrison of Sevastopol and evacuated the wounded, sometimes bombarding German positions en route, her last such mission being on 3 June 1942, after the Germans had already launched the attack that would force the city to surrender in July. She was awarded the Guards title on 18 June in recognition of her performance.|$|E

50|$|Vincent cared little what title {{he served}} under—he {{just wanted to}} fly in combat. After instituting {{procedural}} changes regarding the format of official reports originating from CATF, he assigned himself his first air combat flight on November 22, escorting bombers against <b>the</b> <b>harbor</b> of Haiphong {{on the coast of}} French Indochina, during which he dropped a bomb from his fighter <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor's</b> dock area. Five days later, he scored his first aerial victory: a fixed-undercarriage Japanese fighter he encountered during an attack on Canton in which 10 B-25s and 22 P-40s downed some 16 to 22 enemy aircraft. Vincent noted that he was effectively serving three desk jobs—Exec', 'Intelligence', and 'Operations—but that Chennault was pleased to find his new administrator a skilled pilot eager to fight.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Nemo {{is placed}} in a fish tank {{in the office of}} a dentist. He meets {{aquarium}} fish called the Tank Gang, led by Gill, a moorish idol. The fish learn that Nemo is to be given to the dentist's niece, Darla, who previously killed a fish by constantly shaking its bag. Gill then reveals his plan to escape, jamming the tank's filter with a pebble. The fish would be placed in plastic bags so that the dentist can clean the tank, and then they would roll out the window and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor.</b> Nemo attempts to jam the filter, but fails, almost getting himself killed in the process. Near the harbor, a pelican, Nigel, flies to the dentist's office and brings news of Marlin's adventure. Inspired by his father's determination, Nemo makes a second attempt to jam the filter. Unlike the first attempt, he is able to successfully render the filter useless, but to the tank gang's dismay, the dentist installs a new high-tech filter before they can escape.|$|E
5|$|On 31 March Posen and Westfalen left Danzig; {{the ships}} arrived at Russarö, {{which was the}} outer defense for Hanko, by 3 April. The German army quickly took the port. The task force then {{proceeded}} to Helsingfors; on 11 April the ship passed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor</b> at Helsingfors and landed the soldiers. This included a detachment from the ship which was landed two days later on 13 April. During the operation, Posens crew suffered four men killed and twelve wounded. From 18 to 20 April, Posen assisted with the efforts to free Rheinland, which had been grounded. Two days later, Posen struck a sunken wreck in Helsingfors harbor, which caused minor damage. On 30 April the ship was detached from the Sonderverband Ostsee. The ship returned to Germany, reaching Kiel by 3 May, where she entered drydock. Repair work lasted until 5 May.|$|E
5|$|The {{whole town}} goes cold turkey {{and begins to}} suffer from intense sugar withdrawal. Homer joins a secret group led by Garth Motherloving and Mr. Burns to smuggle sugar from the island of San Glucos. After {{arriving}} back in Springfield, and evading a police boat, Homer brings the sugar to the docks. Marge pleads Homer to dump the cargo. There Homer is presented with two choices: to obey Marge and press the button Drop Cargo or bring the sugar to Garth Motherloving by pressing the button Obey Bad Guy. After contemplating, Homer drops the cargo and all the sugar falls to the Springfield docks' water. All Springfielders, even those who seemed happier and healthier without sugar, jump <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor</b> and drink the sugar water. Judge Snyder then declares the ban over and dives in with everyone else. Marge is upset and she thinks about giving up changing the world. However, Homer tells her that he loves her when she tries to make a world a better place.|$|E

5|$|Using {{the device}} he created earlier, Doom betrays Hager and steals the board from the compound, killing {{most of the}} Army {{personnel}} there. The Fantastic Four rescue the Surfer and pursue Doom in the Fantasticar, confronting him in Shanghai. During the battle, Sue is severely wounded. With the Surfer powerless, Johnny absorbs the combined powers of the entire team in order to battle the now cosmic energy-empowered Doom. Johnny succeeds in breaking Doom's control over the Surfer's board, and Ben Grimm uses a nearby crane to knock Doom <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor.</b> However, Galactus arrives and Sue appears to die in Reed's arms. The Surfer regains control of his board, restoring his power. He revives Sue and chooses to defend Earth, flying, with an extra boost from Johnny, into Galactus. The conflict results in a massive blast of energy that engulfs Galactus, and apparently kills the Surfer as well. Johnny recovers his stable molecular state after touching the Surfer's board.|$|E
5|$|When the United States {{took over}} the Philippine Islands from the Spanish in 1898 after the Spanish–American War, President William McKinley began Americanizing the former Spanish colony. In 1900 he {{appointed}} William Howard Taft to head the Philippine Commission to evaluate {{the needs of the}} new territory. Taft, who later became the Philippines' first civilian Governor-General, decided that Manila, the capital, should be a planned town. He hired as his architect and city planner Daniel Hudson Burnham, who had built Union Station and the Postal Square Building in Washington. In Manila, Burnham had in mind a long wide, tree-lined boulevard along the bay, beginning at a park area dominated by a magnificent hotel. To execute Burnham's plans, Taft hired William E. Parsons, a New York City architect, who envisioned an impressive, comfortable hotel along the lines of a California mission but grander. The original design was an H-shaped plan that focused on well-ventilated rooms on two wings, providing grand vistas of the harbor, the Luneta, and Intramuros. The top floor was, in fact, a large viewing deck that was used for various functions, including watching the American navy steam <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor.</b>|$|E

Mace deduces that Iris may have left something in Lenny's car, and the two go to the impound and find Iris's disc. Steckler and Engleman appear and demand the disc at gunpoint, but Lenny and Mace escape in her car before being forced to stop at a dock. Steckler pours gasoline on the car and sets it on fire, but Mace drives it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor,</b> extinguishing the flames. When they reach the surface, the cops have left.|$|E
