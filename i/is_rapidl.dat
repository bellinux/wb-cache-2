During plant morphogenesis, SCARs are important proteins that reflect an unusual evolutionary outcome, in which the plant kingdom relies heavily on this single class of actin-related protein (ARP) 2 / 3 complex activator to dictate the time and place of actin filament nucleation. This unusually simple arrangementmay serve as a permanent reminder that cell shape control in plants is fundamentally different from that of crawling cells in mammals that use the power of actin polymerization to define and maintain cell shape. In plant cells, actin filaments indirectly affect cell shape by determining the transport properties of organelles and cargo molecules that modulate the mechanical properties of the wall. It is becoming increasingly clear that polarized bundles of actin filaments operate at whole cell spatial scales to organize the cytoplasm and dictate the patterns of long-distance intracellular transport and secretion.

40|$|The {{application}} of a rapid and direct proteotyping approach with which to identify the gene origin of viral antigens in a reassortant influenza strain is demonstrated. The reassortant strain, constructed for a vaccine against type A 2009 H 1 N 1 pandemic influenza, contains genes derived from a wild-type pandemic strain (A/California/ 7 / 2009) and an egg adapted high-growth strain (denoted NYMC X- 157) derived from an earlier A/Puerto Rico/ 8 / 34 strain. The proteotyping approach employs modern proteomics methods and high resolution mass spectrometry to correctly establish that the genes of the surface antigens, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, are derived from the A/California/ 7 / 2009 strain while those for nucleoprotein and matrix protein M 1 antigens are derived from the NYMC X- 157 strain. This is achieved for both gelseparated antigens and those from a whole vaccine digest. Furthermore, signature peptides detected in the mass spectra of the digested antigens enable the engineered reassortant strain {{to be identified as}} a type A virus of the H 1 N 1 subtype in accord with earlier studies. The results demonstrate that proteotyping approach provides a more direct and rapid approach over RT-PCR with which to characterize reassortant strains of the influenza virus at the molecular protein level.

40|$|Viruses that {{naturally}} infect cells expressing both MHC I and MHC II molecules render themselves potentially visible to both CD 8 + and CD 4 + T cells through the de novo expression of viral antigens. Here we use one such pathogen, the B-lymphotropic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), {{to examine the}} kinetics of these processes in the virally-infected cell, comparing newly synthesised polypeptides versus the mature protein pool as viral antigen sources for MHC I- and MHC II-restricted presentation. EBV-transformed B cell lines were established in which the expression of two cognate EBV antigens, EBNA 1 and EBNA 3 B, could be induced and then completely suppressed by doxycycline-regulation. These cells were used as targets for CD 8 + and CD 4 + T cell clones {{to a range of}} EBNA 1 and EBNA 3 B epitopes. For both antigens, when synthesis was induced, CD 8 epitope display rose quickly to near maximum within 24 h, well before steady state levels of mature protein had been reached, whereas CD 4 epitope presentation was delayed by 36 – 48 h and rose only slowly thereafter. When antigen expression was suppressed, despite the persistence of mature protein, CD 8 epitope display fell rapidly at rates similar to that seen for the MHC I/epitope half-life in peptide pulse-chase experiments. By contrast, CD 4 epitope display persisted for many days and, following peptide stripping, recovered well on cells in the absence of new antigen synthesis. We infer that, in virally-infected MHC I/II-positive cells, newly-synthesised polypeptides are the dominant source of antigen feeding the MHC I pathway, whereas the MHC II pathway is fed by the mature protein pool.

HIV- 1 pol sequences of the most prevalent Cuban lineages (subtypes B, C and G, CRF 18 _cpx, CRF 19 _cpx, and CRFs 20 / 23 / 24 _BG) isolated between 1999 and 2011 were analyzed. Maximum-likelihood analyses revealed multiple introductions of subtype B (n$ 66), subtype C (n$ 10), subtype G (n$ 8) and CRF 18 _cpx (n$ 2) viruses in Cuba. The bulk of HIV- 1 infections in this country, however, was caused by dissemination of a few founder strains probably introduced from North America/Europe (clades BCU-I and BCU-II), east Africa (clade CCU-I) and central Africa (clades GCU, CRF 18 CU and CRF 19 CU), or locally generated (clades CRFs 20 / 23 / 24 _BG). Bayesian-coalescent analyses show that the major HIV- 1 founder strains were introduced into Cuba during 1985 – 1995; whereas the CRFs_BG strains emerged in the second half of the 1990 s. Most HIV- 1 Cuban clades appear to have experienced an initial period of fast exponential spread during the 1990 s and early 2000 s, followed by a more recent decline in growth rate. The median initial growth rate of HIV- 1 Cuban clades ranged from 0. 4 year 21 to 1. 6 year 21.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare (inter) national guidelines and analyse differences. Methods: MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library and the internet were searched for guidelines on {{the prevention of}} VTE in orthopedic surgery. From these, we constructed a table comparing the different antithrombotic regimens during different orthopedic surgical and plaster cast treatments. RESULTS: Eleven guidelines from nine different countries and one international guideline were included.

The objective {{of this study was}} to conduct a population pharmacokinetic analysis of vancomycin in a large population of critically ill patients. This was a retrospective data collection of 206 adult septic critically ill patients who were administered vancomycin as a loading dose followed by continuous infusion. The concentration-versus-time data for vancomycin in serum was analyzed by a nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach using NONMEM. Monte Carlo simulations were performed using the final covariate model. We found that the best population pharmacokinetic model consisted of a one-compartment linear model with combined proportional and additive residual unknown variability. The volume of distribu-tion of vancomycin (1. 5 liters/kg) was described by total body weight and clearance (4. 6 liters/h) by 24 -hour urinary creatinine clearance (CrCl), normalized to body surface area. Simulation data showed that a 35 -mg/kg loading dose was necessary to rapidly achieve vancomycin concentrations of 20 mg/liter. Daily vancomycin requirements were dependent on CrCl, such that a patient with a CrCl of 100 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2 would require at least 35 mg/kg per day by continuous infusion to maintain target concentrations.

40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} set of {{principles}} to aid the design of user interfaces that enable blind users to read complex information by listening. Prior to this work speech based interfaces tended to ‘read at’, rather than being read by the listener. By addressing the themes of control of information flow {{and the lack of}} external memory, {{a set of}} guidelines have been produced that transform the passive listener to an active reader. Prosody was used to add information to a spoken presentation of algebra in order to enhance its role as an external memory. A set of rules were developed that inserted prosodic cues for algebra into synthetic speech. An experiment found that these cues enhanced the recovery of syntactic structure; the recovery of content and reduced mental workload. A structure vbased browsing method and associated command language were used to add control over the information flow. An iterative cycle of design and evaluation allowed the development of a style of browsing that would allow the fast and accurate control needed for active reading.

40|$|Throughout {{postnatal}} development, the gastric epithelium expresses Transforming Growth Factor beta 1 (TGFb 1), {{but it is}} also {{exposed to}} luminal peptides that are part of milk. During suckling period, fasting promotes the withdrawal of milk-born molecules while it stimulates gastric epithelial cell proliferation. Such response can be reversed by exogenous TGFb 1, as it directly affects cell cycle through the regulation of p 27 levels. We used fasting condition to induce the hyperproliferation of gastric epithelial cells in 14 -day-old Wistar rats, and evaluated the effects of TGFb 1 gavage on p 27 expression, phosphorylation at threonine 187 (phospho-p 27 Thr 187) and degradation. p 27 protein level was reduced during fasting when compared to suckling counterparts, while phospho-p 27 Thr 187 /p 27 ratio was increased. TGFb 1 gavage reversed this response, which was confirmed through immunostaining. By using a neutralizing antibody against TGFb 1, we found that it restored the p 27 and phosphorylation levels detected during fasting, indicating the specific role of the growth factor. We noted that neither fasting nor TGFb 1 changed p 27 expression, but after cycloheximide administration, we observed that protein synthesis was influenced by TGFb 1. Next, we evaluated the capacity of the gastric mucosa to degrade p 27 and we recorded a higher concentration of the remaining protein in pups treated with TGFb 1, suggesting augmented stability under this condition.

Um cultivo foi submetido a um fotoperÃodo de 8 horas de luz (L) e 16 de escuro (E), o segundo a 12 L e 12 E, o terceiro a 16 L e 8 E e o Ãltimo exposto a 24 h de iluminaÃÃo constante. Os aquÃrios foram dispostos lado a lado em duas incubadoras de madeira, com temperatura ambiente de mantida em 28 Â 2 ÂC com auxÃlio de um âcoolerâ (220 V) e iluminÃncia na superfÃcie da Ãgua em torno de 78, 1 &# 956; E cm- 2 s- 1 fornecida por duas lÃmpadas fluorescentes de 40 W. Os cultivos foram monitorados por espectrofotometria a 680 nm e pela contagem dos filamentos (tricomas) microalgais utilizando um microscÃpio Ãptico comum. A anÃlise simultÃnea dos carotenos e tocoferÃis foi realizada por cromatografia lÃquida de alta eficiÃncia em uma coluna Waters Spherisorb-Hichrom S 5 ODS- 2 (4, 6 x 250 mm) com uma fase mÃvel de MeOH: THF (90 : 10, v/v), fluxo de 1, 5 mL min- 1 e detecÃÃo a 450 nm e 292 nm, respectivamente. A extraÃÃo de -caroteno foi realizada suspendendo-se 0, 1 g de Spirulina liofilizada em 10 mL de metanol:Ãgua Milli-Q (90 : 10, v/v). Para a saponificaÃÃo dos lipÃdios, a mistura foi homogeneizada com 7 % de hidrÃxido de potÃssio, levada ao banhomaria a 70 ÂC por 30 min e submetida Ã partiÃÃo em n-hexano que foi evaporado. O resÃduo foi suspenso em 1 mL de metanol e 100 &# 956;L foram injetados manualmente, em duplicata, no sistema cromatogrÃfico. O -caroteno foi detectado na biomassa obtida de todos os cultivos e o -tocoferol apenas nos cultivos com fotoperÃodos de 8 L e 16 E e de 12 L e 12 E, enquanto o -tocoferol nÃo foi detectado. O teor de -caroteno variou de acordo com a intensidade luminosa e quando as culturas foram expostas a 24 h de iluminaÃÃo constante, atingiram mais rapidamente a produtividade mÃxima e apresentaram o maior teor de -carotenoThe microalga cyanophyceae Spirulina platensis {{has been}} commercialized and studied {{due to its}} high nutritional value. It has {{shown to be a}} rich source of a great variety of vitamins, minerals, proteins, polyunsaturated fatty acids, carotenoids, phycobilins, and polysaccharides that exhibit potential therapeutic properties. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the content of -carotene and -tocopherol in S. platensis cultivated in laboratory under different conditions of photoperiods. S. platensis was cultivated within six 20 -liter reservoirs under four different illumination conditions. The first culture was grown under 8 - hour light (L) and 16 -hour dark (D) photoperiod; the second, 12 L and 12 D photoperiod; the third, 16 L and 8 D photoperiod, and the forth cultivation condition was constant illumination. The reservoirs were placed side by side in two wood chambers, where room temperature was kept at 28 Â 2 ÂC with a cooler (220 V). The water surface illumination of 78. 1 &# 956;E cm- 2 s- 1 was supplied by two 40 -Watt fluorescent lamps. The cultures were monitored by spectrometry at 680 nm and by counting microalga filaments (trichomes) under an optical microscope. The simultaneous analysis of carotenoids and tocopherols was performed by high performance liquid chromatography in a Waters Spherisorb-Hichrom S 5 ODS- 2 (4. 6 x 250 mm) column using MeOH:THF (90 : 10, v/v) as mobile phase, delivered at 1. 5 mL min- 1. The detector was set at 450 nm and 292 nm for carotenes and tocopherols, respectively. For the extraction of both compounds, three portions of 0. 1 g lyophilized Spirulina were suspended in 10 mL methanol:MiliQ water (90 : 10, v/v). The mixture was homogenized with a 7 % potassium hydroxide aqueous solution, brought to a water bath at 70 ÂC for 30 min, for saponification, followed of partitioning into n-hexane which was evaporated to dryness. The residues were suspended in 1 mL methanol, and 100 &# 956;L aliquots were manually injected in the chromatographic system. -Carotene was detected in the biomass obtained from all the cultures and a-tocopherol was detected only in 8 L and 16 D and 12 L and 12 D photoperiods cultures. -Tocopherol, on the other hand, was not detected. The content of -carotene varied with illumination intensity and in the cultivation performed under constant illumination both maximum productivity and highest -carotene content <b>were</b> reached <b>rapidl...</b>|$|R
