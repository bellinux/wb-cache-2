40|$|Airtightness {{of timber}} frame {{buildings}} {{not having a}} plastic film vapour barrier Good airtightness of a building {{can be achieved by}} the incorporation of an <b>inner</b> <b>sealing</b> layer for the exterior walls and roofs {{in the form of a}} plastic film, which also serves as a vapour barrier. However, if it is not wished to use plastic film as an <b>inner</b> <b>sealing</b> layer, then airtightness must be effected through the use of other materials or in some other way. This project has been concerned with investigation of a number of alternatives. It has been found that the arrangement most commonly used in Sweden today comprises polymer-based fibre sheets (which permit diffusion) and gypsum board, as alternatives to plastic film on the inside of the structure. The work of the project has shown that, provided that the materials are airtight in their own right, it is possible to achieve as good airtightness with alternative materials as can be achieved with plastic film. This has been demonstrated in the laboratory and in three of five houses in the field investigation. However, the airtightness performance of the finished building can be very poor unless care is taken both in the design and in construction, and this was also revealed in the field work...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{experimental results}} from a research facility which experimentally models hot gas ingress into the wheel-space of an axial turbine stage. Measurements of CO 2 gas concentration in the rim-seal region and inside the wheel-space are {{used to assess the}} performance of generic (though engine-representative) single and double seals in terms of the variation of concentration effectiveness with sealing flow rate. The variation of pressure in the turbine annulus, which governs externally-induced ingress, was obtained from steady pressure measurements downstream of the vanes. The benefit of using double seals is demonstrated: The ingested gas is shown to be predominately confined to the outer wheel-space radially outward of the inner seal; in the inner wheel-space, radially inward of the <b>inner</b> <b>seal,</b> the effectiveness is shown to be significantly higher. Criteria for ranking the performance of single and double seals are proposed, and the performance limit for any double seal is shown to be one in which the <b>inner</b> <b>seal</b> is exposed to rotationally-induced ingress. Although the ingress is a consequence of an unsteady, three-dimensional flow field and the cause-effect relationship between pressure and the sealing effectiveness is complex, the experimental data is shown to be successfully calculated by simple effectiveness equations developed from a theoretical model. The data illustrate that, for similar turbine-stage velocity triangles, the effectiveness can be correlated using two empirical parameters. In principle, these correlations could be extrapolated to a geometrically-similar turbine operating at enginerepresentative conditions...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{radioactive}} packagings with three-O-ring closure seals, {{the middle}} O-ring being the containment seal, {{have the potential}} for false positive results from leakage rate tests. The volume between the containment O-ring and the inner O-ring is used for the helium gas required for the leakage rate tests, to reduce both the amount of helium used and the time for the tests. False positive results can be caused by either a large leakage in the containment sea/l or a leakage in the <b>inner</b> <b>seal.</b> This paper describes the problem, together with possible solutions/areas {{that need to be addressed}} in a Safety Analysis Report for Packaging...|$|R
