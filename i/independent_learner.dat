40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to ascertain if the effectiveness of conversational narrations and non-conversational narrations in multimedia environment will be mediated by learners’ field dependence and gender. 53 participants (25 field dependent and 28 field independent subjects) were randomly divided to interact with either one of the two multimedia lessons on C-Programming: conversational narrations or non-conversational narrations. Learning achievements of participants were then assessed in three different measures: drawing, terminology and comprehension.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we analyze the {{convergence}} of <b>independent</b> adaptive <b>learners</b> in repeated games. We show that, in this class of games, <b>independent</b> adaptive <b>learners</b> converge to pure Nash equilibria in self play, if they exist, and to a best response strategy against stationary opponents. We discuss the relation between our result and convergence results of adaptive play [1]. The importance of our result {{stems from the fact}} that, unlike adaptive play, no communication/action observability is assumed. We also relate this result to recent results on {{the convergence of}} weakened ficticious play processes for <b>independent</b> <b>learners</b> [2, 3].

40|$|In {{reinforcement}} learning, agents {{learn by}} performing actions and observing their outcomes. Sometimes, {{it is desirable}} for a human operator to interrupt an agent {{in order to prevent}} dangerous situations from happening. Yet, as part of their learning process, agents may link these interruptions, that impact their reward, to specific states and deliberately avoid them. The situation is particularly challenging in a multi-agent context because agents might not only learn from their own past interruptions, but also from those of other agents. Orseau and Armstrong defined safe interruptibility for one learner, but their work does not naturally extend to multi-agent systems. This paper introduces dynamic safe interruptibility, an alternative definition more suited to decentralized learning problems, and studies this notion in two learning frameworks: joint action <b>learners</b> and <b>independent</b> <b>learners.</b> We give realistic sufficient conditions on the learning algorithm to enable dynamic safe interruptibility in the case of joint action learners, yet show that these conditions are not sufficient for <b>independent</b> <b>learners.</b> We show however that if agents can detect interruptions, it is possible to prune the observations to ensure dynamic safe interruptibility even for <b>independent</b> <b>learners...</b>|$|R

40|$|This is a {{case study}} of an educator’s journey to {{implement}} early childhood science education to a group of three to four year old students from a nursery 2 class in a neighbourhood childcare centre. Difficulties faced and effective methods used during implementation are the focal points of this study. Traits of an <b>independent</b> <b>learner</b> were developed through the use of mediated learning experience (MLE), using science as a vehicle to teach these skills. From a social-constructivist perspective, learning is more likely to occur if adults or more competent peer mediate children’s learning experiences. There is a growing consensus among early childhood professionals that the past success in improving basic skills in the “three Rs ” (Reading, wRiting and aRithmetic) has not matched with the current demands of the twenty-first century. This study focuses {{on the role of the}} teacher in guiding preschool children’s science learning while they play with everyday materials. Checklists were available to trace the development of fundamental areas such as process skills, thinking skills and scientific discourse. There is an increasing need to introduce early childhood science education into the local context as science involved the development of thinking skills and it also requires students to use appropriate tools and techniques essential in developing an <b>independent</b> <b>learner.</b> Creating an environment that is scientifically empowering and mediating children’s experiences in this environment establishes the foundation of an <b>independent</b> <b>learner...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{landscape}} of UK Higher Education has witnessed {{significant change in}} recent years, characterised by rapidly increasing numbers, widening participation, and a diminished per capita resource base. Developmental and enhancement agenda have placed greater emphasis on skills for lifelong learning, and the <b>independent</b> <b>learner</b> has thus become a prominent theme. In architecture education these factors are imposing pressures on the traditional studio-based teaching model, one that forms a universal cornerstone of architecture schools. Coincidentally, the same period has seen this model, endorsed by Schon in the 1980 s, increasingly challenged. It is argued that the confluence of these factors, presents an opportunity to develop studio-based pedagogy around {{the notion of the}} <b>independent</b> <b>learner,</b> renewing studio's relevance and currency. The aim of this thesis was developed from a literature review that was divided into four sections. The first summarised developments within UK higher education, including research into the First Year Experience, and placed architecture education within this context. The second examined the origins of contemporary studio-based teaching, whilst the third discussed the theoretical roots of its pedagogy. The final chapter critiqued teaching and learning practices through comparison with the theoretical intent, revealing a number of contradictory and counter-productive aspects. From this, the position that the development of the truly <b>independent</b> <b>learner</b> in the discipline of architecture requires the formulation of new inclusive pedagogic strategies that explicitly accommodate the individual in the studio-based learning process, and address identified shortcomings in existing studio-based teaching practices, was developed. The methodology adopted an ethnographic approach that gathered data through a longitudinal study of student perceptions, together with interviews with selected academics. Analysis of the findings, whilst replicating many phenomena raised by the literature, also revealed in detail a range of perceptions of learning, and wider student life, giving insight into key challenges. In considering these against the agendum of creating the <b>independent</b> <b>learner,</b> the importance of the peer group as a vehicle for studio-based learning and pastoral support, emerged strongly. A number of recommendations were thus made aimed at reconstructing the role of the tutor in the development of future strategies, as well as harnessing the unrealised potential of the peer group as an agent in embedding independent learning in design studio. The originality of this thesis resides in the fact that it constitutes a holistic study of teaching and learning practices in first year design studio. This is viewed against the background of rapid change in UK Higher Education. Pivotal to the study was the undertaking of a longitudinal survey of student perceptions, presenting a vitally different perspective from, say, that of Schon. From a holistic standpoint, the study creates the theoretical and evidential basis for the future development of key pedagogic strategies relating to design studio. This lays the foundation for the development of learning practices that foster learner independence within the context of design studio...|$|E
