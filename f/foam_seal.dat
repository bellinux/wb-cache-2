Tests were performed on 120 -ft 2 solid-concrete-block seals of varying thicknesses and designs. Of the seven solid-concrete-block seals tested, only the standard-type seal, having a 16 -in thickness, keyed at the floor and ribs, all joints mortared, wedged at the roof, and a center pilaster, maintained its integrity when subjected to a 20 -psig pressure wave. After being subjected to repeated explosions, the standard seal only showed a small hairline crack and had an air leakage of 87 ft 3 /min at a pressure differential of 1 in H 2 O. Tests were performed on cementitious foam seals of varying thicknesses and compressive strengths. Explosion tests have shown that 200 -psi strength, 4 - and 8 -ft-thick seals can withstand a 20 -psig pressure wave.

40|$|The National Mining Association and the Mine Safety and Health Administration {{requested}} that the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conduct full-scale evaluations of a recently developed carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) reinforcement technique for upgrading existing mine ventilation seals to withstand an explosion pressure of 50 psi or greater. The evaluation was conducted in the NIOSH Pittsburgh Research Laboratory's Lake Lynn Experimental Mine (LLEM) near Fairchance, PA. The purpose of the evaluation {{was to determine the}} blast resistance of the CFRP reinforcement technique, designed to increase the strength of two types of existing 20 -psi-rated in situ mine ventilation seals. Two candidate ventilation seals were selected to represent the 20 -psi alternative seal designs typical of those used in mines prior to July 2006.

Cyclic axial displacements are applied to a heavy pipe buried in a narrow trench (less than three pipe diameters wide), using various backfill cover depths and two different soils: dry Hostun sand and a damp silty sand. A novel testing tank is employed, with compressible <b>foam</b> <b>seals</b> to allow the pipe to settle as it moves axially, and a pressure bag system to simulate backfill depths exceeding {{the height of the}} tank. The test pipe is instrumented to measure (a) the axial soil resistance developed on an isolated central section of pipe (thus avoiding tank boundary effects), and (b) the normal and shear contact stresses at a number of points around the pipe circumference. The results indicate that both the axial resistance and the normal stress distribution around the pipe can undergo considerable changes when a pipeline experiences cyclic axial displacements. An extreme case identified here is the potential for a compacted damp sand backfill to ‘arch’ completely over the pipe as a result of differential settlement, leading to unexpectedly low axial resistance. To address some limitations of the design method currently used in industry, a new approach for estimating axial resistance is suggested and applied to the present test data...|$|R

High suction is continued until no more material is drained, usually after 7 ± 8 days. We have treated 15 patients by this method with good results; only in one case a further debridement was necessary with second inten-tion healing. Cosmetic results were very satisfactorily in the remaining 14 patients. Mean hospital stay after infection diagnosis was 9 ^ 2 days.

The extinguisher body was charged with plain water, and the discharge pressure mixed the foam concentrate with the water upon squeezing the lever.

Os experimentos laboratoriais foram conduzidos em sala climatizada à 25 ± 2 °C, UR de 70 ± 10 % e fotofase de 12 horas. Ninfas de segundo ínstar de P. flavescens foram individualmente acondicionadas em caixas de isopor contendo cada uma 500 mL de água livre de cloro e, estando essas no terceiro, quinto e sétimo ínstares, foram tratadas com B. thuringiensis var. israelensis, através do produto microbiano Vectobac®, em formulação granulada.
