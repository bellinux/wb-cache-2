40|$|Abstract: To {{explore the}} {{prevalence}} of secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS) exposure of college students at two locations, i. e., on campus and in the home, and to identify factors associated with SHS exposure at each location, a preliminary cross-sectional study was conducted on 1754 nonsmoking students from two universities in Korea. In total, 83. 1 % were exposed to SHS {{at least once a}} week on campus or at home; the average SHS <b>exposure</b> <b>was</b> 3. 4 times per week. Specifically, 79. 7 % and 23. 5 % were exposed to SHS on campus and in the home, respectively. On campus, SHS <b>exposure</b> <b>was</b> significantly more prevalent in freshmen and sophomore students. In the home, SHS <b>exposure</b> <b>was</b> significantly more prevalent among females, those with smokers in their families, and those who rated their health as poor. SHS <b>exposure</b> <b>was</b> common among nonsmoking college students, with more than two-thirds exposed on campus.

5|$|<b>Exposure</b> <b>is</b> {{raised for}} people who live near thorium deposits, {{radioactive}} waste disposal sites, those who live near or work in uranium, phosphate, or tin processing factories, {{and for those who}} work in gas mantle production. Thorium is especially common in the Tamil Nadu coastal areas of India, where residents may be exposed to a naturally occurring radiation dose ten times higher than the worldwide average.|$|E
5|$|Lead <b>exposure</b> <b>is</b> {{a global}} issue since lead mining and smelting, and battery manufacturing/disposal/recycling, {{are common in}} many countries. Lead enters the body via inhalation, ingestion, or skin absorption.

5|$|The {{major source}} of nickel <b>exposure</b> <b>is</b> oral consumption, as nickel is {{essential}} to plants. Nickel is found naturally in both food and water, and may be increased by human pollution. For example, nickel-plated faucets may contaminate water and soil; mining and smelting may dump nickel into waste-water; nickel–steel alloy cookware and nickel-pigmented dishes may release nickel into food. The atmosphere may be polluted by nickel ore refining and fossil fuel combustion. Humans may absorb nickel directly from tobacco smoke and skin contact with jewelry, shampoos, detergents, and coins. A less-common form of chronic <b>exposure</b> <b>is</b> through hemodialysis as traces of nickel ions may be absorbed into the plasma from the chelating action of albumin.|$|E
5|$|Thorium {{exists in}} very small {{quantities}} everywhere on Earth: the average human contains about 100micrograms of thorium and typically consumes three micrograms per day. Most thorium exposure occurs through dust inhalation; some thorium comes {{with food and}} water, but because of its low solubility, this <b>exposure</b> <b>is</b> negligible.|$|E
5|$|Cannabis {{can be a}} {{contributory}} {{factor in}} schizophrenia, potentially causing the disease in those who are already at risk.

Early <b>exposure</b> <b>is</b> strongly associated with an increased risk. The size of the increased risk is not clear, but appears to be in the range of two to three times greater for psychosis. Higher dosage and greater frequency of use are indicators of increased risk of chronic psychoses.|$|E
40|$|Field workerswere {{monitored}} for dermal {{and respiratory}} exposure to chlorpyrifos (with and without crop oil), carbaryl, and permethrin at reentry intervals of 2, 4, 8, 24, and 48 h after application. Insecticides {{were applied to}} R 3 stage corn through an overhead center-pivot irrigation system. Dermal <b>exposure</b> <b>was</b> measured by analyzing 18 gauze pads attached to the clothing of workers to represent human body regions.

Respiratory <b>exposure</b> <b>was</b> determined using portable air samplers equipped with polyurethane foam plugs to trap ambient insecticide residues. Gas liquid chromatography was used to quantify residues of chlorpyrifos and permethrin in gauze pads, gloves, and foam plugs. Carbaryl residues in pads, gloves, and foam plugs were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography.

5|$|Ethylene glycol {{has a low}} vapor pressure; it {{does not}} {{evaporate}} readily at normal temperatures and therefore high concentrations in air or intoxication are unlikely to occur following inhalational exposures. There may be a slight risk of poisoning where mists or fogs are generated, although this rarely leads to poisoning as ethylene glycol causes irritation and coughing when breathed in, alerting victims to its presence. Ethylene glycol is not well absorbed through skin meaning poisoning following dermal <b>exposure</b> <b>is</b> also uncommon.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to lead {{may also}} {{decrease}} lifespan and have health {{effects in the}} long term. Death rates {{from a variety of}} causes {{have been found to be}} higher in people with elevated blood lead levels; these include cancer, stroke, and heart disease, and general death rates from all causes. Lead is considered a possible human carcinogen based on evidence from animal studies. Evidence also suggests that age-related mental decline and psychiatric symptoms are correlated with lead exposure. Cumulative exposure over a prolonged period may have a more important effect on some aspects of health than recent exposure. Some health effects, such as high blood pressure, are only significant risks when lead <b>exposure</b> <b>is</b> prolonged (over about one year).|$|E
5|$|Geologists have dated and {{documented}} dozens of major eruptions over the volcano's long history, bridging the long gap between Kīlauea's oldest known rock and only extremely recent written records and historical observation. Historical lava {{flows from the}} volcano are generally recovered by scientists {{in one of three}} ways. The oldest flows, dating back 275,000 to 225,000 years, have been recovered from Kīlauea's submerged southern slope by ship-towed remotely operated vehicles. These lavas exhibit forms characteristic of early, submerged preshield-stage eruptive episodes, from when the volcano was still a rising seamount that had not yet breached the ocean surface, and their surface <b>exposure</b> <b>is</b> unusual, as in most other volcanoes such lavas would have since been buried by more recent flows.|$|E

5|$|If {{exposed to}} testosterone, the genital {{tubercle}} elongates {{to form the}} penis. By fusion of the urogenital folds– elongated spindle-shaped structures {{that contribute to the}} formation of the urethral groove on the belly aspect of the genital tubercle– the urogenital sinus closes completely and forms the spongy urethra, and the labioscrotal swellings unite to form the scrotum. In the absence of testosterone, the genital tubercle allows for formation of the clitoris; the initially rapid growth of the phallus gradually slows and the clitoris is formed. The urogenital sinus persists as the vestibule of the vagina, the two urogenital folds form the labia minora, and the labioscrotal swellings enlarge to form the labia majora, completing the female genitalia. A rare condition that can develop from higher than average androgen <b>exposure</b> <b>is</b> clitoromegaly.|$|E
5|$|Indium {{is a minor}} {{component}} in zinc sulfide ores and is produced as a byproduct of zinc refinement. It is most notably used in the semiconductor industry, in low-melting-point metal alloys such as solders, in soft-metal high-vacuum seals, and {{in the production of}} transparent conductive coatings of indium tin oxide (ITO) on glass. Indium has no biological role, though its compounds are somewhat toxic when injected into the bloodstream. Most occupational <b>exposure</b> <b>is</b> through ingestion, from which indium compounds are not absorbed well, and inhalation, from which they are moderately absorbed.|$|E
5|$|Manganism is a biphasic disorder. In {{its early}} stages, an {{intoxicated}} person may experience depression, mood swings, compulsive behaviors, and psychosis. Early neurological symptoms {{give way to}} late-stage manganism, which resembles Parkinson's disease. Symptoms include weakness, monotone and slowed speech, an expressionless face, tremor, forward-leaning gait, inability to walk backwards without falling, rigidity, and general problems with dexterity, gait and balance. Unlike Parkinson's disease, manganism is not associated with loss of smell and patients are typically unresponsive to treatment with L-DOPA. Symptoms of late-stage manganism become more severe over time even if the source of <b>exposure</b> <b>is</b> removed and brain manganese levels return to normal.|$|E
