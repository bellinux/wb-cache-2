5|$|In 1836, native Vermonter John Deere set {{out from}} Rutland, Vermont to Grand Detour, Illinois, founded by his friend and fellow Vermont native Leonard Andrus. The town lacked a local blacksmith, Deere's trade, and within two days Deere had a forge and new {{business}} established. <b>In</b> <b>Vermont,</b> Deere produced plows made from cast-iron and when he first arrived in Illinois he produced the same plows. Soil conditions in Illinois differ from those <b>in</b> <b>Vermont.</b> <b>In</b> <b>Vermont</b> the soil is sandy and falls easily away from the plow blade but in Illinois the soil is thicker and wetter; it stuck to the plow {{and had to be}} scraped off by the farmer as he plowed.|$|E
5|$|Under the NatureServe {{conservation}} status system, A.viridimontanum is considered globally vulnerable (G3). It is considered imperiled (S2) <b>in</b> <b>Vermont</b> and vulnerable (S3) in Quebec; {{it has not}} yet been classified in Maine.|$|E
5|$|Ralph Edward Flanders (September 28, 1880 – February 19, 1970) was an American {{mechanical}} engineer, industrialist and Republican U.S. Senator {{from the}} state of Vermont. He grew up on subsistence farms <b>in</b> <b>Vermont</b> and Rhode Island, and was an apprentice machinist and draftsman, before training as a mechanical engineer. He spent five years in New York City as an editor for a machine tool magazine. After moving to Vermont, he managed and then became president of a successful machine tool company. Flanders used his experience as an industrialist to advise state and national commissions <b>in</b> <b>Vermont,</b> New England and Washington, D.C. on public economic policy. He was president of the Boston Federal Reserve Bank for two years before being elected U.S. Senator from Vermont.|$|E

5|$|The {{work which}} led to the {{recognition}} of Adiantum viridimontanum as a distinct taxon began in the early 20th Century. Following the discovery of disjunct specimens of western maidenhair fern, then classified as A.pedatum var. aleuticum, on the serpentine tableland of Mount Albert by Merritt Lyndon Fernald in 1905, botanists began to search for western maidenhair on ultramafic outcrops elsewhere in Quebec and Vermont. It was first identified <b>in</b> <b>Vermont</b> by L. Frances Jolley in 1922 at Belvidere Mountain in Eden. In 1983, William J. Cody transferred A.pedatum growing on serpentine, both in eastern and western North America, to A.pedatum ssp. calderi instead. Many of the stations for the fern <b>in</b> <b>Vermont</b> were described in 1985, in a survey of ultramafic outcrops in that state.|$|E

5|$|In 1909, {{while working}} long hours on his {{definitive}} book on gear cutting machinery, his energy gave {{out and he}} suffered a “nervous breakdown.” He had {{to take time off}} to recover. In 1910, he accepted a job offer to work in a machine tool company <b>in</b> <b>Vermont.</b> He continued to write on technical and other matters throughout his life and would develop a broader philosophy of the role of industry in society. In 1938, he received a Worcester Reed Warner Medal in recognition of his technical writing.|$|E
5|$|Through {{both his}} father and mother, Hayes was of New England colonial ancestry. His {{earliest}} American ancestor emigrated to Connecticut from Scotland in 1625. Hayes's great-grandfather, Ezekiel Hayes, was a militia captain in Connecticut in the American Revolutionary War, but Ezekiel's son (Hayes's grandfather, also named Rutherford) left his Branford home during the war for the relative peace of Vermont. His mother's ancestors arrived <b>in</b> <b>Vermont</b> at a similar time, {{and most of his}} close relatives outside Ohio continued to live there. John Noyes, an uncle by marriage, had been his father's business partner <b>in</b> <b>Vermont</b> and was later elected to Congress. His first cousin, Mary Jane Noyes Mead, was the mother of sculptor Larkin Goldsmith Mead and architect William Rutherford Mead. John Humphrey Noyes, the founder of the Oneida Community, was also a first cousin. He {{became a member of the}} Sons of the American Revolution based on his descent from Daniel Austin and Elias Birchard.|$|E

5|$|Like {{all white}} males in New Hampshire {{between the ages}} of 18 and 45, Pierce {{was a member of the}} state militia, and was {{appointed}} aide de camp to Governor Samuel Dinsmoor in 1831. He remained in the militia until 1847, and attained the rank of colonel before becoming a brigadier general in the Army during the Mexican–American War. Interested in revitalizing and reforming the state militias, which had become increasingly dormant during the years of peace following the War of 1812, Pierce worked with Alden Partridge, president of Norwich University, a military college <b>in</b> <b>Vermont,</b> and Truman B. Ransom and Alonzo Jackman, Norwich faculty members and militia officers, to increase recruiting efforts and improve training and readiness. Pierce served as a Norwich University trustee from 1841 to 1859, and received the honorary degree of LL.D. from Norwich in 1853.|$|E

Vice President Coolidge was <b>in</b> <b>Vermont</b> visiting his family home, which had neither electricity nor a telephone, when he received word by messenger of Harding's death. He dressed, said a prayer, and came downstairs to greet the reporters who had assembled. His father, a notary public and justice of the peace, administered {{the oath of office}} in the family's parlor by the light of a kerosene lamp at 2:47a.m. on August 3, 1923; President Coolidge then went back to bed.|$|E
5|$|Pin Oak Court, <b>in</b> <b>Vermont</b> South, is {{the real}} {{cul-de-sac}} that doubles for Ramsay Street. All of the houses featured in the show are real and the residents allow Neighbours to shoot external scenes in their front and back yards and on occasions, in their garages. Neighbours has been filmed in Pin Oak Court since the series began in 1985 and it has since become popular with tourists. Tours to the cul-de-sac run throughout the year. The interior scenes are filmed at the Global Television studios in Forest Hill, the adjoining suburb in which Pin Oak Court is located.|$|E

5|$|Some breeds, {{such as the}} American Quarter Horse in Texas and the Morgan horse <b>in</b> <b>Vermont</b> and Massachusetts, {{were named}} as the state horse because of the close {{connection}} between {{the history of the}} breed and the state. Others, including the Tennessee Walking Horse and the Missouri Fox Trotter, include the state in the official breed name. School children have been persuasive lobbyists for the cause of some state horses, such as the Colonial Spanish Horse being named the state horse of North Carolina due to the presence of the Spanish-descended Banker horses in the Outer Banks, while others have been brought to official status through the lobbying efforts of their breed registries.|$|E
5|$|The American {{black duck}} is a habitat generalist {{as it is}} {{associated}} with tidal marshes and present throughout the year in salt marshes from the Gulf of Maine to coastal Virginia. It usually prefers freshwater and coastal wetlands throughout northeastern America, including brackish marshes, estuaries and edges of backwater ponds and rivers lined by speckled alder. It also inhabits beaver ponds, shallow lakes with sedges and reeds, bogs in open boreal and mixed hardwood forests, as well as forested swamps. Populations <b>in</b> <b>Vermont</b> have also been found in glacial kettle ponds surrounded by bog mats. During winter, the American black duck mostly inhabits brackish marshes bordering bays, agricultural marshes, flooded timber, agricultural fields, estuaries and riverine areas. Ducks usually take shelter from hunting and other disturbances by moving to brackish and fresh impoundments on conservation land.|$|E
5|$|The storm dropped {{moderate}} rainfall <b>in</b> <b>Vermont,</b> {{including a}} total of 5.73inches (141mm) in Mays Mill. The rainfall caused road washouts, landslides, and damage to bridges in the southeast portion of the state. The center of Tropical Storm Doria passed over south-central New Hampshire, resulting in heavy rains and damaging winds. Sustained winds in Maine were generally around 30mph (48km/h), while gusts peaked at 61mph (98km/h) in Lewiston. The strong winds resulted in downed trees and widespread outages to power and telephone service. The winds also damaged a mobile home in Sabattus and a steel shed in Lewiston. Doria produced moderate rainfall, including {{a total of}} 1.75inches (44mm) in Lewiston, though little flooding occurred.|$|E

5|$|The wing {{hosted the}} Cape Cod Air Show & Open House, its last air show with the F-15C Eagle {{at the end}} of Air Force Week in August 2007. The wing shared a {{commonality}} with the 101st Air Refueling Wing, the 103d Fighter Wing, and the 104th Fighter Wing, which due to commission decisions, also changed the type of planes that they flew. Beginning in 2007, the F-15s began moving to Barnes Municipal Airport. With the grounding of the F-15 Eagles, the 158th Fighter Wing, which is based <b>in</b> <b>Vermont</b> took over the role of patrolling the Northeast's skies earlier than expected. This interruption of the F-15's flight, coinciding with the transitioning of the fighter jets to the 104th Fighter Wing, created some issues.|$|E
5|$|Thirty-seven {{people were}} killed during the storm and its aftermath.

5|$|While Allen's {{service as}} a judge <b>in</b> <b>Vermont</b> was brief, he {{continued}} to ferret out Tories and report them to local Boards of Confiscation for action. He was so zealous in these efforts that they also included naming his own brother Levi, who was apparently trying to swindle Allen and Ira out of land at the time. This action was somewhat surprising, as Levi had not only attempted to purchase Allen's release {{while he was in}} Halifax, but he had also traveled to New York while Allen was on parole there, and furnished him with goods and money. Allen and Levi engaged in a war of words, many of which were printed in the Connecticut Courant, even after Levi crossed British lines. They would eventually reconcile in 1783.|$|E
