5|$|Generally sharks {{have only}} one layer of tesserae, but the <b>jaws</b> <b>of</b> large specimens, such as the bull shark, tiger shark, and the great white shark, have two to three layers or more, {{depending}} on body size. The <b>jaws</b> <b>of</b> a large great white shark may have up to five layers. In the rostrum (snout), the cartilage can be spongy and flexible to absorb the power of impacts.|$|E
5|$|Hadrocodium, whose fossils {{date from}} {{approximately}} 195 million years ago, {{in the early}} Jurassic, provides the first clear evidence of a jaw joint formed solely by the squamosal and dentary bones; there is no space in the jaw for the articular, a bone involved in the <b>jaws</b> <b>of</b> all early synapsids.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, {{researchers}} {{hypothesized that}} smooth-edged holes {{found in the}} fossil <b>jaws</b> <b>of</b> tyrannosaurid dinosaurs such as Albertosaurus were caused by a parasite similar to Trichomonas gallinae, which infects birds. They suggested that tyrannosaurids transmitted the infection by biting each other, and that the infection impaired their ability to eat food.|$|E
5|$|In many plants, {{defensive}} or {{storage structures}} {{are made by}} modifications {{of the development of}} primary leaves, stems, and roots. Leaves are variously modified from photosynthetic structures to form the insect-trapping pitchers of pitcher plants, the insect-trapping <b>jaws</b> <b>of</b> Venus flytrap, and the spines of cactuses, all homologous.|$|E
5|$|The Murray cod {{is a large}} grouper-like {{fish with}} a deep, {{elongated}} body that is round in cross section. It has a broad, scooped head, and a large mouth lined with pads of very small, needle-like teeth. The <b>jaws</b> <b>of</b> the Murray cod are equal, or the lower jaw protrudes slightly.|$|E

5|$|The dentary {{gradually}} became the main bone {{of the lower}} jaw which, by the Triassic, progressed towards the fully mammalian jaw (the lower consisting only of the dentary) and middle ear (which is constructed by the bones that were previously used to construct the <b>jaws</b> <b>of</b> reptiles).|$|E

5|$|Antlion larvae {{are capable}} of {{capturing}} and killing a variety of insects and other arthropods, and can even subdue small spiders. The projections in the <b>jaws</b> <b>of</b> the larva are hollow and through this, the larva sucks the fluids out of its victim. After the contents are consumed, the dry carcass is flicked out of the pit. The larva readies the pit once again by throwing out collapsed material from the center, steepening the pit walls to the angle of repose.|$|E

5|$|Eglin steel uses a {{combination}} of over a dozen different elements in varying amounts to create a relatively low-cost steel for use in bunker buster weapons. Hadfield steel (after Sir Robert Hadfield) or manganese steel contains 12–14% manganese which when abraded strain-hardens to form an incredibly hard skin which resists wearing. Examples include tank tracks, bulldozer blade edges and cutting blades on the <b>jaws</b> <b>of</b> life.|$|E
5|$|Paley {{considers}} the equivalents of human anatomy in other animals. Human clothing {{is compared to}} the fur, feathers, quills and scales of animals. The structure of the feather is admired. The teeth and <b>jaws</b> <b>of</b> carnivores, herbivores and omnivores are considered. Similarly, the adaptations of birds' bills in species like the crossbill, spoonbill and (long-billed) snipe are discussed.|$|E
5|$|Racial-Morphological Examinations of the Anterior Portion of the Lower Jaw in Four Racial Groups. This dissertation, {{completed}} in 1935 and {{first published in}} 1937, earned him a PhD in anthropology from Munich University. In this work Mengele sought to demonstrate that there were structural differences in the lower <b>jaws</b> <b>of</b> individuals from different ethnic groups, and that racial distinctions could be made based on these differences.|$|E

50|$|Older {{alligator}} shears were {{powered by a}} flywheel. These shears ran continuously, which posed a safety hazard. Now {{alligator shears}} are hydraulically actuated. When actuated, the piston arm extends and slowly closes the upper <b>jaw</b> <b>of</b> the alligator shear, which passes alongside the bed or lower <b>jaw</b> <b>of</b> the shear to perform the cut.|$|R
5|$|The diet of Pteranodon {{is known}} to have {{included}} fish; fossilized fish bones have been found in the stomach area of one Pteranodon, and a fossilized fish bolus has been found between the <b>jaws</b> <b>of</b> another Pteranodon, specimen AMNH 5098. Numerous other specimens also preserve fragments of fish scales and vertebrae near the torso, indicating that fish made up a majority of the diet of Pteranodon (though they may also have taken invertebrates).|$|E
5|$|The fossils from Punta Alta {{included}} a nearly perfect head and three fragments of {{heads of the}} Megatherium Cuvierii, the jaw of a related species which Owen named Mylodon Darwinii, and <b>jaws</b> <b>of</b> Megalonyx Jeffersonii. The near complete skeleton was named Scelidotherium by Owen, who found it had most of its bones nearly in their proper relative positions. At the nearby Monte Hermoso beds the numerous rodents included species allied to the Brazilian tuco-tuco and the capybara.|$|E
5|$|Megalodon is {{represented}} in the fossil record by teeth, vertebral centra, and coprolites. As with all sharks, the skeleton of megalodon was formed of cartilage rather than bone; consequently most fossil specimens are poorly preserved. To support its large dentition, the <b>jaws</b> <b>of</b> megalodon {{would have been more}} massive, stouter, and more strongly developed than those of the great white, which possesses a comparatively gracile dentition. Its chondrocranium, the cartilaginous skull, would have had a blockier and more robust appearance than that of the great white. Its fins were proportional to its larger size.|$|E

5|$|The survivors' vehicle {{suffers a}} blowout, {{prompting}} them to swerve onto a farm. The {{back of the}} car is penetrated by PVC pipes which injure Eugene, and he is rushed to the hospital. As rescuers arrive at the scene, Brian Gibbons, the son of a farm owner, is nearly killed by a speeding news van, but Rory saves him. Using the <b>Jaws</b> <b>of</b> Life Kat's rescuer accidentally activates the airbag and her head is impaled by a pipe protruding from her headrest. Her cigarette falls out of her hand and into a gasoline leak leading to the news van, causing the van to explode, and sending a barbed wire fence flying through the air, which kills Rory.|$|E
5|$|A {{powerful}} and versatile deepwater predator, the short, robust <b>jaws</b> <b>of</b> the kitefin shark {{give it an}} enormously strong bite. It feeds mainly on bony fishes (including deepwater smelts, viperfishes, scaly dragonfishes, barracudinas, greeneyes, lanternfishes, bristlemouths, cod and other gadids, grenadiers, deepwater scorpionfishes, bonito, snake mackerels, deepwater cardinalfishes, and sea toads), but also takes {{a wide variety of}} other animals, including skates, smaller sharks (Galeus, Squalus, Etmopterus and Centrophorus), squid and octopus, crustaceans (amphipods, isopods, shrimp and lobsters), polychaete worms, and siphonophores. Like the related cookiecutter shark, the kitefin shark is also capable of excising chunks of flesh from animals larger than itself, including other sharks and whales. The presence of fast-swimming fishes in its diet suggests the kitefin shark may scavenge, or have some other means of capturing faster prey. In the Mediterranean, bony fishes are the most important food year-round, with the second-most important prey being sharks in the winter and spring, crustaceans in the summer, and cephalopods in the fall. Captured males {{are more likely to have}} full stomachs than females for unknown reasons.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} early sauropodomorphs, {{it has been}} {{proposed}} that Massospondylus had cheeks. This theory was proposed {{because there are a}} few large holes for blood vessels on the surfaces of the jaw bones, unlike the numerous small holes present on the <b>jaws</b> <b>of</b> cheekless reptiles. The cheeks would have prevented food from spilling out when Massospondylus ate. Crompton and Attridge (1986) described skulls of Massospondylus as possessing pronounced overbites and suggested the presence of a horny beak on the tip of the lower jaw {{to make up the difference}} in length and account for tooth wear on the teeth at the tip of the snout. However, the difference in length may be a misinterpretation based on crushing in a top–bottom plane, and the possession of a beak is considered unlikely in recent studies.|$|E
