50|$|An {{intermittent}} {{fillet weld}} {{is one that}} is not continuous across a joint. These welds are portrayed as a set of two numbers {{to the right of the}} triangle instead of just one. The first number as mentioned earlier refers to the length of the weld. The second number, separated from the first by a “-”, refers to the pitch. The pitch is a measurement from midpoint to midpoint of the intermittent welds. Intermittent welding is used when either a continuous weld is not necessary, or when a continuous weld threatens the joint by warping. In some cases intermittent welds are staggered on both sides of the joint. In this case, the notation of the two triangles aren't directly on top of each other. Instead, the side of the joint to receive the first weld will have a triangle further to the left than the following side’s triangle notation.

Thus, understanding the behavior of <b>fillet</b> <b>welds</b> under various types of loading is important, and numerical simulations can provide increased insight into this topic. This paper concerns finite element simulations of previous quasi-static and dynamic (impact) tests on <b>fillet</b> <b>welds.</b> The test specimens employed were structural steel components joined by either longitudinally or transversely oriented <b>fillet</b> <b>welds.</b> In the simulations, the material of the <b>fillet</b> <b>welds</b> was modeled using a shear-modified Gurson model, which accounts for material softening in both low and high stress triaxiality regimes. Additionally, strain rate and temperature dependencies were incorporated in the material model with a modified Johnson–Cook constitutive relation for the matrix material. Several types of material tests were conducted to identify the parameters entering the material model. For the quasi-static component tests and simulations, a good agreement was observed {{in terms of both}} force–deformation curves and failure mechanisms. The simulations of the dynamic tests predicted appreciably higher force levels and weld deformations at failure than those obtained in the corresponding experiments. A parameter study showed that these discrepancies may partly be due to inaccurate values used for the material parameters related to strain-rate hardening and thermal softening. Finally, a comparison was made between simulations with the shear-modified Gurson model and a simpler material model that does not account for void-induced softening. The simpler model employed the Cockcroft–Latham failure criterion, uncoupled from the constitutive relations. This model was unable to capture the response of the <b>fillet</b> <b>welds</b> to the same extent as the shear-modified Gurson model...|$|E
40|$|There is no {{economic}} technology available {{to measure the}} <b>fillet</b> <b>weld</b> geometry on a regular basis. External aspects of a <b>fillet</b> <b>weld</b> can be easily measured using specifically designed gauges, but the internal characteristic of penetration cannot. To guarantee the structural integrity of a <b>fillet</b> <b>weld</b> {{it is important that}} there is enough penetration to ensure that the axis between the bar and the plate is effectively ‘cut’, see figure 1. A random study of the parameters set by welders showed wide ranging differences, some of which led to lack of penetration in the <b>fillet</b> <b>weld.</b> As a result of this finding, a programme of work has been put in place which relies on an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach as a method to develop the optimum set of <b>fillet</b> <b>welding</b> parameters.

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to provide {{practical}} guidelines {{for the design of}} welded joints of steel truss for encased composite steel–concrete beams.

The external geometry of the <b>fillet</b> <b>weld</b> can be easily measured, however the internal geometry (i. e. penetration), which is critical in determining the structural integrity of the joint, is difficult to measure without destructively testing the workpiece. Consequently the most cost effective way to ensure adequate penetration is to maintain close control of the input parameters. Furthermore if we can demonstrate tight control of the parameters and interactions that affect the joint penetration then we can increase the confidence that sufficient penetration is being achieved.

40|$|Abstract <b>Fillet</b> <b>welds</b> {{are by far}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} arc welding joint type in the fabrication industry with about 80 % of all arc welded joints worldwide. Alt-hough the joint is well established, there are many aspects to consider when pro-ducing an ideal weld. This paper reveals and connects several problematic issues related to the joint type and the difficulties to fabricate a weld with correct strength, cost, and quality. Excessive welding of <b>fillet</b> <b>welds</b> is common, resulting in increased fabrication cost. There could be several causes for this; the designers do not customize the weld demand for the different stress levels and the production adds even more to handle the variation in the process. Previous studies shows that the combination of these factors can result in 100 % extra weld metal, compared to what should be needed to fulfil the strength demands. Inspections are another contributor to excess welding. The capability of the weld size measurement method used by welders and inspectors is unsatisfactory. Measurement system analyses show that the scatter from the measurement system itself is in the same range as the scatter from the process. A critical summary of the current state-of-the-art is that <b>fillet</b> <b>welds</b> are hard to specify and fabricate with the right size, that the measuring method is incapable and the connection between size and strength is weak. ...|$|E
