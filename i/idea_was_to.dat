5|$|After the Stuxnet attack, Kaspersky {{proposed}} that the Internet needed more regulation and policing. One <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> have {{some parts of the}} Internet anonymous, while more secure areas require user identification. He argued that anonymity mostly benefited cybercriminals and hackers. For example, accessing a nuclear power plant network could require a verified identity through a digital passport.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Light {{became famous}} among {{aviation}} enthusiasts {{due to his}} 1934 around-the-world flight. To celebrate his marriage to Meader, he wished to approximate the same, and Meader was happy to comply. During the planning of the trip, many points on Earth had not been captured on film from {{the air and the}} American Geographical Society promoted these photographic flights, as they were trying to build an aerial collection. Light's <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> travel across areas South America and Africa never been aerially photographed.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the Acurad system {{employed}} a patented double shot piston design. The <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> use a second piston (located within the primary piston) to apply pressure after the shot had partially solidified {{around the perimeter}} of the casting cavity and shot sleeve. While the system was not very effective, it did lead the manufacturer of the Acurad machines, Ube Industries, to discover that it was just as effective to apply sufficient pressure at the right time later in the cycle with the primary piston; this is indirect squeeze casting.|$|E

5|$|Gautier thought Heine's Wilis and Hugo's fifteen-year-old Spanish {{girl would}} make a good ballet story. His first <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> present an empty ballroom {{glittering}} with crystal and candlelight. The Wilis would cast a spell over the floor. Giselle and other dancers would enter and whirl through the room, unable to resist the spell to keep them dancing. Giselle would try to keep her lover from partnering other girls. The Queen of the Wilis would enter, lay her cold hand on Giselle's heart and the girl would drop dead.|$|E
5|$|Hubert Humphrey got {{his start}} in Minnesota {{politics}} in the early 1940s. He was an organizer of the Minnesota Democratic Party at the time, {{and he realized that}} the party's best chance of success would come if the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party merged with the Democratic party. Other party leaders had been discussing the merger, but Humphrey's <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> keep the Farmer-Labor name {{in the name of the}} merged party, in order to gain the strength of thousands of loyal voters. Thus, the party got the name Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.|$|E
5|$|Rundgren {{contemplated}} recording more {{tracks to}} make up a double album in a similar manner, but following an earthquake, he decided to relocate to New York City and hold a live recording session at the Record Plant with session players. The basic <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> create songs with sing-along choruses. Rundgren did not pre-plan who would play on the sessions, but simply wanted anyone who happened to be in or near the studio to turn up and learn the material.|$|E

5|$|Sony Entertainment {{originally}} conceived The Spectacular Spider-Man as {{a series}} of four DVDs, and asked Weisman and Cook to develop it. The central <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> follow Spider-Man in his younger years in the comics; Weisman and Cook wanted to incorporate the styles of the early comic publications by Lee and Ditko. Reviewers have cited other influences in the themes, such as the live action film series and the Ultimate Spider-Man continuity.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} {{team also}} considered other methods of recovering active {{material in the}} event of a dud explosion. One <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> cover it with a cone of sand. Another was to suspend the bomb in a tank of water. As with Jumbo, it was decided not to proceed with these means of containment either. The CM-10 (Chemistry and Metallurgy) group at Los Alamos also studied how the active material could be chemically recovered after a contained or failed explosion.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{film the}} opening sequence in 1.33:1 aspect ratio {{in order to}} simulate the TV screens that were {{available at the time}} of the assassination, then transition to 1.85:1 when Garrison began his investigation, and finally switch to 2.35:1 for scenes occurring in 1968 and later. However, because of time constraints and logistics, Richardson was forced to abandon this approach.|$|E
5|$|The series {{underwent}} further {{changes during}} {{the months leading up}} to and following its debut. A May 2006 press release mentioned that sketches from The Girlie Show would be made available in their entirety on NBC's broadband website, DotComedy.com. The <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> air the fictitious TGS with Tracy Jordan online. This aspect of the series was abandoned prior to its debut.|$|E
5|$|After {{finishing}} {{work on the}} Spyro the Dragon series, Insomniac originally intended to launch a game codenamed I5 (Insomniac game #5) for the PlayStation 2. The developers, however, were never enthusiastic about it, and the idea was dropped after six months. Ratchet & Clank {{was based on an}} idea by Brian Hastings, which would feature a space-traveling reptile alien who would collect various weapons as he progressed through the game; Ratchet's final form was decided upon after Insomniac considered a space lizard with a tail and various terrestrial creatures, including dogs and rats; feline features stood out to the developers because of the associated sense of agility. Another early <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> have a three small robots attached to Ratchet, which would perform different functions. However, Insomniac realized that having the robots was both complicated and created confusion about Ratchet's appearance, leading them to have only one robot, Clank.|$|E

5|$|ArtRave's {{concept and}} name {{are derived from}} the {{similarly}} named release party for Artpop. The stage resembled a cave and consisted of two sections connected by catwalks made of translucent lucite, allowing the audience to move underneath the catwalks while still being able to watch the show. Gaga's costumes in the show included one with tentacles, one with bejeweled wings, a rave-inspired outfit and a necklace made of marijuana leaves. Costume designers and choreographers aspired to make a single, coherent show. The lighting fixtures used for the concert were from Clay Paky and the main <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> create an immersive rave experience with the lights. They were also designed to accommodate minor changes in the show sequences.|$|E
5|$|As {{a student}} at Carnegie Mellon University in 2004, Druckmann was tasked with {{creating}} a video game concept to present to film director George A. Romero, who would select a winner. Druckmann's <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> merge the gameplay of Ico (2001) in a story set during a zombie apocalypse, like that of Romero's Night of the Living Dead (1968), with a lead character similar to John Hartigan from Sin City (1991–2000). The lead character, a police officer, would be tasked with protecting a young girl; however, due to the lead character's heart condition, players would often assume control of the young girl, reversing the roles. Though the idea did not win, Druckmann later developed it when creating the story of The Last of Us. An early idea for the game was that the infection only spread to women, though this was later deemed misogynistic.|$|E
5|$|Gaga {{performed}} {{songs from}} her third studio album Artpop (2013) at ArtRave, a two-day event hosted by her {{to promote the}} album. In 2014, she headlined her first residency show, with seven shows at the Roseland Ballroom in Manhattan, New York. Later that year, she began the , whose main <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> create an immersive rave. The tour received a positive response from reviewers, but some criticized it for being disjointed. After the release of her collaborative album with Tony Bennett, Cheek to Cheek (2014), the duo embarked on their Cheek to Cheek Tour, which began in December 2014 and concluded in August 2015. The tour was critically acclaimed, and topped Vulture's list of 10 best concerts of 2015. In 2015, she received her third Billboard Music Award for Top Touring Artist nomination; she was also nominated in 2011 and 2013.|$|E

5|$|General Motors' then-Vice-Chairman Robert Lutz {{said the}} {{two-seater}} sports car {{being developed by}} Tesla, the Tesla Roadster, and the rapid advancement of lithium-ion battery technology inspired him to push the carmaker to develop the Volt after the 2006 Detroit Auto Show, overcoming internal opposition. Lutz's initial <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> develop an all-electric car, but Jon Lauckner, General Motors Vice President for Global Vehicle Development, convinced him that to avoid an expensive battery, range anxiety concerns, and lack of public charging infrastructure, they could use a smaller battery pack with a small gasoline engine driving a generator acting as a backup to extend the range, but without a mechanical connection between the gasoline engine and the drive wheels, {{so it would be}} a pure electrically driven vehicle without many of the limitations General Motors learned from the EV1 experience.|$|E
5|$|General manager Kytölä {{travelled}} to France and West Germany in 1947 {{and early}} 1948 to buy military surplus {{materials from the}} Western Allies. He bought 425 White Motor Company M2 Half-Track vehicles, 186 lorry engines, 304 Cadillac V8 engines, 4 Mack ED diesel engines, 2 Hercules Diesel DFXE engines, 11,000 GMC wheels and one 45-tonne-capacity trailer. Trading was organised through the Ministry of Supply and the first delivery arrived in March 1948. The White Half-Track vehicles were without armour; Kytölä's <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> equip them with superstructures for field or forest clearing, or to convert them into Four-wheel drive lorries by replacing the tracks with a conventional rear axle. In total, VAT sold 359 units as half-tracks, and 60 were converted into 4×4 or 4×2 vehicles. These lorries were sold as Vanaja VaWh. Some of the half-track vehicles were scrapped for parts; the last was sold in 1952.|$|E
5|$|In his book, German Architecture in China, Warner Torsten {{writes of}} the cathedral: According to residents] the cathedral {{is far too}} large for the scale of Qingdao. Its {{position}} {{on top of a}} hill makes this even more evident. Perhaps the <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> produce a powerful building to hold its own with the Protestant Church, which for 20 years had been the largest religious building in Qingdao, or perhaps the intention was to outstrip the 46metre-high towers of the Franciscan church in Jinan. The towers of the cathedral in Qingdao were higher than all the other churches in the major cities of Northern China– Tianjin, Beijing, Dalian, or Jinan. They dominate the silhouette of Qingdao; they are particularly impressive from a ship entering the harbour.|$|E
