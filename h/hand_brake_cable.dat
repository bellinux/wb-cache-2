25|$|Locomotives and {{carriages}} {{each have}} a <b>hand</b> <b>brake</b> which operates brake blocks that clasp drums {{on either side of}} the pinions. On the steam locomotives the <b>hand</b> <b>brake</b> is applied manually; two identical <b>hand</b> <b>brake</b> levers are fitted, one for the driver and one for the fireman. On the diesel locomotives, the <b>hand</b> <b>brake</b> is applied by a powerful spring and held off by a hydraulic system.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, in bicycles, shifter cables are {{anchored}} on the shifter {{with a small}} cylindrical nipple, concentric {{with the}} <b>cable.</b> Bicycle <b>brake</b> nipples however, vary between mountain bikes (MTB), with straight handlebars, and road bikes, with drop-handlebars. MTB bikes use a barrel-shaped (cylindrical) nipple to anchor the <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> at the <b>brake</b> lever, while road bikes have a pear-shaped nipple. Some replacement <b>brake</b> <b>cables</b> for bicycles come with both styles, one on each end. The unneeded end is cut off and discarded upon installation.|$|R
50|$|Although the {{flatland}} bicycle {{is similar}} to most other BMX bicycles, flatland is often performed with specially designed frames with geometry (head tube angle, top tube length, etc.) suited {{to the needs of}} flatlanders. Front and rear bolt-on pegs, a hollow compression bolt on the forks for the front <b>brake</b> <b>cable,</b> and a rear <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> detangler or Gyro to allow the bars to rotate endlessly without tangling the <b>brake</b> <b>cables.</b> Also invented specifically for flatland riding is the rear hub mechanism known as a freecoaster, which allows the rear wheel to roll backwards without engaging the hub and making the cranks rotate backwards as they would on a normal freewheel or cassette style hub. Other technical bicycle setup specifics can include zero offset forks, narrow handlebars, very high pressure tires (100psi and higher), and a very small front sprocket (18-28 teeth).|$|R
5000|$|In {{cars with}} rear drum brakes, the parking <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> usually actuates these drums {{mechanically}} with much less force than {{is available through}} the hydraulic system.|$|R
50|$|Some stems have a {{hole through}} the {{horizontal}} part to support the front <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> on bikes with cantilever brakes such as cyclo-cross bicycles and older mountain bikes.|$|R
5000|$|... "Servo Wave" [...] - This is {{a system}} Shimano {{introduced}} to brake levers which allowed them to pull more <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> {{at the start of}} the lever stroke than at the end, giving improved separation between the brake blocks and the rim to allow for mud and lack of trueness in the wheels while still delivering the same braking power as systems which have a constant ratio between lever movement and cable pull and therefore less pad clearance. This was introduced during the mid-1990s. This was implemented initially by mounting the <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> on a roller that moves towards the lever pivot in a slot in the lever blade as the lever is pulled. A second design pulled the <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> downwards towards a cam near to the brake lever pivot instead. Servo wave has appeared for the first time on a hydraulic disk brake lever on the 2008 Shimano XT groupset.|$|R

50|$|The tikit was {{introduced}} in 2007. Early versions of the tikit employed a pair of <b>brake</b> <b>cables</b> in the hyperfold mechanism. This mechanism permitted excessive flex in the handlebar stem when ridden.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} work is to show an example of 3 D {{modeling}} and optimization combined with the design and production of prototype and experimental testing of a very important composing part of the mechanism for compensating the aeration in automobile <b>hand</b> <b>brake.</b> The basic notions about purpose, function, buyer’s demands, specifics of the <b>hand</b> <b>brake</b> assemble construction are given. The proposal of concept {{for the development of}} the assembly, conceived by the buyer, is given as well. Design/methodology/approach: Very important task of the mechanism for compensating the aeration in automobile <b>hand</b> <b>brake</b> is to assure its function safety and a permanent grip angle of the <b>hand</b> <b>brake.</b> A new construction is made, which will satisfy the above mentioned demands, then the 3 D technique is used to choose an optimal model, and, based on it, prototypes were produced and experimentally tested in real conditions. Findings: A new design of the elements of <b>hand</b> <b>brake</b> is developed. Research limitations/implications: The proposed methodology is repeatable for other similar mechanisms. Practical implications: Based on the research, new design of the mechanism of automobile <b>hand</b> <b>brake</b> is developed, by which the advancement of final product is enabled. Originality/value: : The demands of construction and mechanism functional safety are entirely satisfied...|$|R

25|$|Harding {{left the}} lead {{locomotive}} No.5017 running to keep air pressure supplied to the train's air brakes and also applied {{a number of}} <b>hand</b> <b>brakes.</b> Yves Bourdon, a member of MMA's Board of Directors, stated that the air brakes of all locomotives and freight cars had been activated, as well as <b>hand</b> <b>brakes</b> on 5 locomotives and 10 of the 72 freight cars. However, the TSB agrees with a July 6 statement to police by the train's engineer that he set <b>hand</b> <b>brakes</b> on just the five locomotive engines, a buffer car, and a car housing the remote control apparatus. The engineer also attempted a brake test but incorrectly left the locomotive air brakes on; this gave the false impression that the <b>hand</b> <b>brakes</b> alone would hold the train.|$|R
50|$|The detangler, Gyro or rotor is an {{invention}} for the freestyle BMX bicycle, allowing the handlebars {{to turn a}} complete 360° rotation without the <b>brake</b> <b>cables</b> getting tangled up. SST oryg is another common manufacturer of detangler systems.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to air brake systems, all locomotives and rail cars {{are equipped with}} at least one <b>hand</b> <b>brake.</b> This is a mechanical device that applies brake shoes to the wheels to prevent them from moving. The effectiveness of <b>hand</b> <b>brakes</b> depends on several factors, including their age, their maintained condition, their application in conjunction with air brakes, and the force exerted by the person applying the brake, which can vary widely. The TSB estimated that somewhere between 17 and 26 <b>hand</b> <b>brakes</b> would have been needed to secure the train. Which if {{there would have been a}} two-man crew the crew would have been able to perform a stabilization test, which is all air brakes released and ensuring just the <b>hand</b> <b>brakes</b> will hold the train. Since there was only a one-man crew this test was not possible.|$|R

After the run, some drivers protested, and during a post-qualifying inspection, it was found that Arnold's <b>brake</b> <b>cables</b> were not connected.

50|$|In cars, {{the parking}} <b>brake,</b> also called <b>hand</b> <b>brake,</b> {{emergency}} brake, or e-brake, is a latching brake usually {{used to keep}} the vehicle stationary.Automobile <b>hand</b> <b>brakes</b> usually consist of a cable directly connected to the brake mechanism on one end and to a lever or pedal at the driver's position. The mechanism is often a hand-operated lever (hence the <b>hand</b> <b>brake</b> name), on the floor {{on either side of}} the driver, or a pull handle located below and near the steering wheel column, or a (foot-operated) pedal located far apart from the other pedals.In most automobiles the parking brake operates only on the rear wheels, which have reduced traction while braking.Some cars have the parking brake operate on the front wheels, for example most Citroens manufactured since the end of World War II.|$|R
