40|$|Increased {{movement}} toward alliances and grid pricing in the U. S. {{has led to}} an increase interest in genetic values for carcass traits. The literature suggests that carcass genetic values are an effective tool to enhance selection for carcass traits, and {{that it is possible to}} select sires within a breed that can increase marbling score without adversely affecting external fat thickness or percent retail product relative to the breed mean. Ultrasound has been investigated as a cheaper means of collecting carcass information. The literature indicates that carcass traits measured via ultrasound on yearling seedstock will respond to selection. Although the literature is variable on the subject, there are reported genetic correlation (r g) estimates between live animal ultrasound and actual carcass attributes that are greater than. 70 for all ultrasonically measured carcass traits. When r g between seedstock ultrasound and slaughter cattle carcass measures are > 0. 70, similar or greater genetic progress in <b>finished</b> <b>cattle</b> carcass merit could be achieved by using ultrasound information entirely compared to using typical carcass progeny information; however, the maximum accuracy of prediction using ultrasound information in lieu of <b>finished</b> <b>cattle</b> carcass information would be r g. Therefore both actual and live animal, ultrasonically measured carcass traits should be included in genetic evaluation programs, which will allow for an increase in the accuracy of prediction of carcass genetic values on young seedstock animals due to the inclusion of ultrasound information, and will also allow for the possible production of high accuracy sires based on <b>finished</b> <b>cattle</b> progeny carcass information.

40|$|Ninety-six {{yearling}} steers weighing 850 lbs {{were used}} in a study to evaluate condensed distillers solubles (CDS) for a dry mill corn processing plant {{as a replacement for}} a portion of the corn grain and supplemental nitrogen in a finishing ration supplemented with urea. Condensed distillers solubles were fed at 0 %, 4 %, 8 % and 12 % of ration dry matter in a 109 -day experiment. Feeding CDS at these levels had no effect on performance of the cattle, carcass measurements or carcass value in a value-based grid. The calculated replacement value of CDS in this study was considerably less than observed in two previous experiments, likely due to experimental variation or possibly variability of CDS among processing plants. Based on the results of the three experiments, CDS has value as a feed for <b>finishing</b> <b>cattle</b> and its relative energy value is equal to or greater than corn grain.

40|$|During ethanol production, starch is {{the primary}} {{nutrient}} fermented and the remaining byproducts are excellent sources of fiber and protein. In addition, inclusion of byproducts in finishing diets may {{reduce the incidence of}} acidosis. As a result, roughage level and quality could potentially be reduced in finishing diets containing byproducts. Three experiments were conducted {{to examine the effects of}} roughage and wet corn gluten feed (WCGF) in <b>finishing</b> <b>cattle</b> diets containing corn distillers grains plus solubles. Cattle fed finishing diets containing wet distillers grains plus solubles (WDGS) with no roughage had decreased DMI and ADG compared to cattle fed roughage. Within roughage level, ADG was similar for cattle fed alfalfa hay, corn silage or corn stalks when included on an equal NDF basis. Apparent total tract digestibility of OM, NDF, and CP linearly decreased and ruminal pH variables increased linearly due to increasing roughage levels. Roughage sources can be exchanged on an equal NDF basis in beef finishing diets containing 30 % WDGS (DM basis). In finishing diets containing modified distillers grains plus solubles (MDGS), DMI linearly increased due to increasing roughage levels but ADG responded quadratically and was lowest for cattle fed diets without roughage. There was also a quadratic response for DMI and ADG due to WCGF inclusion level. Gain:feed decreased linearly with increasing roughage and WCGF inclusion levels. Feeding 15 % WCGF resulted in similar cattle performance and carcass traits to cattle fed no WCGF in diets containing 30 % MDGS, but cattle fed diets with 60 % total byproduct inclusion made up of 30 % WCGF and 30 % MDGS had reduced performance (DM basis). Additionally, reducing corn silage inclusion level to 7. 5 % resulted in similar <b>finishing</b> <b>cattle</b> performance and carcass traits to cattle fed 15 % corn silage in diets containing 30 % MDGS with or without inclusion of WCGF. Elimination of roughage in diets containing either WDGS or MDGS resulted in negative impacts on <b>finishing</b> <b>cattle</b> performance, ruminal metabolism, and carcass traits. ...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 Feedlot <b>finishing</b> of beef <b>cattle</b> in Southern Alberta {{involves}} income risk due to {{the variability}} of prices of feeders, feed and <b>finished</b> <b>cattle.</b> Several strategies are available to reduce this risk, including hedging of cattle on feed, participation in a Federal- Provincial government and producer established income stabilization program for <b>finished</b> <b>cattle</b> (National Tripartite Stabilization Plan) and diversification of production plans. This study evaluated the efficacy and interaction effects of these strategies in reducing net income variability in cattle feeding in Southern Alberta. Concerns that were addressed included: (1) whether participation in hedging or Stabilization would increase firm-level slaughter cattle output, (2) whether portfolio effects exist between production and marketing alternatives, (3) whether participation in Stabilization would reduce participation in hedging (4) whether hedging performance could be increased by hedging the Canadian dollar, and (5) whether privately supplied hedging versus publicly supplied Stabilization is better able to handle income risk in cattle feeding. The theory of decision making under uncertainty was reviewed {{to determine how to}} best incorporate the risk aspects of the feedlot, management problem. Expected Value-Variance (EV) and safety-first risk analyses were identified as frameworks for formulation of the feedlot management problem in a mathematical programming context. Using data from 1976 - 87, linear risk programming (MOTAD and Target MOTAD) models of the feedlot process were constructed to analyze the alternatives for reducing income risk. Results for the 1986 - 87 feeding year suggested that, at moderate levels of risk aversion, feedlot managers should maintain high levels of hedging of both live cattle and the Canadian dollar with moderate participation (25 percent of cattle on feed) in the Stabilization plan. Significant portfolio effects were present. Hedging, but not Stabilization, was found to increase firm-level output by increasing the average weight to which a group of <b>cattle</b> would be <b>finished.</b> Participation in Stabilization was found to reduce hedging participation by an average of 10 percent.
