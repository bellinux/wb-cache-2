30|$|Plant growth-promoting (PGP) {{microbes}} are rhizosphere associated {{organisms that}} colonize the rhizosphere and rhizoplane and improve plant growth when artificially inoculated onto the seeds or into soil. PGP microbes may promote plant growth either by direct stimulation such as iron chelation, phosphate solubilization, nitrogen fixation and phytohormone production or by indirect stimulation such as suppression of plant pathogens and induction of resistance in host plants against pathogens (Basak and Biswas 2009; Hao et al. 2011; Panhwar et al. 2012). The opportunities of PGP microbes include alternating applications of PGP microbes as bio-fungicides with <b>inorganic</b> <b>fungicides</b> to manage fungicide resistance {{and to reduce}} the number of fungicide applications per year. PGP microbes also plays an important role in integrated nutrient management programs with a goal of reducing run-off of unused fertilizers and the environment damage that results (Kloepper 2009; Gopalakrishnan et al. 2013 a).|$|E
30|$|A {{wide range}} of organic and <b>inorganic</b> <b>fungicides</b> is {{currently}} in use for wood preservation industry [1]. However, because of the health concerns {{associated with the use}} of these chemical treatments, the recent trend has been to develop environmentally benign approaches for the protection of wood. In this context, the search for simple bioactive compounds derived from plants that can be used against wood decay fungi has been a research direction for ecologically safe products [2]. For instance, essential oils are known to contain a natural mixture of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, and hydrocarbons, with a variety of functional groups, giving them antibacterial, antifungal, antitermite, and insecticidal activities. To protect wood from fungal and other biological damage, natural preservatives such as essential oils could be an attractive alternative compared to the use of highly toxic traditional wood preservatives [3]. However, essential oils have a wide use in pharmaceutical and food industry as antimicrobial agents, but their use as wood preservatives has not been fully explored. In this study, the chemical composition of essential oils from eighteen Egyptian plants was described using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS), and their antifungal activities against two common tropical wood decay fungi were investigated.|$|E
40|$|Possibility of V. inaequalis {{control on}} apple variety Idared was {{evaluated}} by ecologically acceptable {{products such as}} <b>inorganic</b> <b>fungicides</b> and acidified clays. The obtained results were compared with common, chemical protection. Year 2009 {{was one of the}} unfavorable for V. inaequalis, and 2010 was extremely favorable for apple scab development. Accordingly, in 2009 intensity of infection on apple leaves and fruits in control variant was low (leaves 15, 4 - 34, 9 %; fruits 0 - 23, 8 %). In 2010 infection intensity on leaves and fruits was high (leaves 81, 2 %; fruits 100 %). During period 2009 - 2010, in these different environmental conditions, common chemical protection showed high efficacy (leaves 96, 2 - 100 %; fruits 97, 5 - 100 %). High efficacy level in control of V. inaequalis on leaves of 87, 4 - 99, 7 % was achieved also in variants in which copper products were applied in low concentration of 0, 05 %. It should be noted that in the most critical period, in April and May of 2010, the treatmentswere carried out in 5 - 6 days interval. Copper products showed differing efficacy on fruits (48, 5 - 90, 2 %). In 2009 which is considered as one of the unfavorable for V. inaequalis development, product Ulmasud B applied alone on leaves was less efficiacy (51, 8 - 58, 6 %), than on fruits (87, 8 %). In the same year, efficacy of this product in combination with sulfur, was better (leaves 71, 4 - 76, 6 %; fruits 86, 6). In 2010, which was especially rainy and favourablefor spreading the disease, efficiacy of mention combination of products didn,t satisfy (leaves 44, 8 %; fruits 41, 0 %). In the system of organic production, during vegetation period, program of apple protection in control of V. inaequalis should be supplemented by use of low concentrations of copper products (0, 05 %) and by various alternative products of different action mechanisms,such as mineral clays, sulfur products etc. These researches should be continued...|$|E
40|$|N-Tox® {{is a new}} {{technique}} for evaluating the nitrification efficiency in industrial or municipal activated sludge systems, using direct measurement of nitrous oxide (N 20) {{as an indicator of}} nitrification failure. Research using pilot-scale activated sludge plants treating real settled wastewater has demonstrated that detection of increased N 2 O concentration in the aeration tanks by N-Tox® is able to provide early warning of nitrification failure. The N-Tox® monitor relies on non-invasive gas-phase detection which avoids sampling of activated sludge and eliminates associated probe fouling problems and maintenance issues. Nitrification failure detection by N-Tox® is rapid, giving plant operators the time to take remedial action before possible release of ammonia. Recently presented data has shown the effectiveness of N-Tox® in providing early warning of nitrification inhibition following loss of aeration and ammonia overloading events. New data is now presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of N-Tox® in providing early warning of nitrification failure for a number of well-known toxic chemicals. These include the organic compound phenol, the nitrification suppressant allylthiourea (ATU) and the <b>inorganic</b> <b>fungicide</b> and herbicide, sodium azide. N-Tox® was able to detect nitrification failure when the first step of nitrification was inhibited, resulting in a rise in effluent ammonia, and when the second step was inhibited, resulting in a rise in effluent nitrite. The pattern of N 2 O emission indicated the failure mode: a sharp peak indicated ammonia breakthrough whereas a sustained increase in N 2 O indicated nitrite formation. The N-Tox® device {{can also be used to}} quantify emissions of N 2 O, a powerful greenhouse gas, from wastewater treatm...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{efficiency}} resulting from optimization of energy consumptionin organic farming, the amount of consumption and production inputs and their costs, obtained profit, cultivated area and … was estimated in conjuction with the three crop of wheat, canola and tomato in Iran over a five year period 2006 - 2011. Using the objective function and constraints, the DEA method was {{used to analyze the}} data. All the processes of models estimation was performed using DEAP software. To calculate the energy amount in external inputs consumption in conventional and organic farming were used coefficients to convert the amount of energy input consumption, too. Finally, the energy consumptions were compared in the two cultures. According to these results, the use of organic fertilizers and biological inputs (in consequence of more energy consumption in organic specific inputs) leads to lower productivity growth in organic products. These results were significant in the 5 and 1 percent levels, respectively. Due to the type of used inputs in the inorganic products, in fuel inputs, nitrogen fertilizer, phosphate fertilizer, insecticide and <b>fungicide,</b> <b>inorganic</b> products had more consumption and hence the amount of energy inputs for organic products was higher. In the case of biofertilizer and biocontrol were also used in organic production, input energy in this part was more than input energy of inorganic products. Organic farms with lower energy consumption of imports and inputs, led to production of more energy in output. Thus the efficiency besides saving of energy consumption occurred in organic products...|$|R
40|$|The leafhopper, Acia lineatifrons (Naude) was {{identified}} as a pest on grapevines near Tulbagh in 1978 and has since been reported on grapevines all over the South Western Cape. A. lineatifrons causes browning of the leaves which often results in the shedding of the discoloured leaves. Heavy defoliation before harvest can result in sunburn damage to the grapes, whilst premature leaf loss after harvest adversely affects the ripening of the canes and the accumulation of reserves. This project was aimed at obtaining basic information on the biology and population dynamics of A. lineatifrons as well as to identify priorities for future research. This information is needed to develop a reliable crop-linked predictive model, methods for monitoring pest populations as well as to develop efficient short- and long-term control measures and pest management strategies. The life cycle of A. lineatifrons was studied in the laboratory. At 26 °C the mean incubation period of the eggs was nine to eleven days, the mean developmental period for the five nymphal instars was 15 days and the minimum pre-oviposition period five to ten days. This adds up to a mean generation time of 29 to 36 days at 26 °C. At 20 °C the mean nymphal development period was 25 days, confirming the strong influence of temperature on the development rate. Fecundity was determined in the laboratory as the number of nymphs produced per female. The mean of 8, 5 nymphs per female recorded at 26 °C is very low compared to that of other leafhopper species (see Appendix 2). The low fecundity measured was most likely due to sub-optimal environmental conditions in the laboratory, a reduction in the suitability of the host plant under these conditions and handling of the females. The seasonal occurrence of A. lineatifrons on grapevines was studied over three seasons. It was found that the leafhoppers overwinter in the adult stage on indigenous Rubus spp, and that they enter the vineyard from the end of October until the beginning of November. Peak populations occurred between the middle of February and the end of March after which the population declined steadily {{towards the end of the}} season as the vine leaves were shed. The sex ratio of the overwintering population on R. chrysocarpus was heavily female biased, possibly due to differential mortality of the sexes. During the growing season the sex ratio was slightly male biased and reached equality on several occasions, both on the Rubus and on the grapevines. The movement of A. lineatifrons between the Rubus and the grapevines was investigated, but no evidence of a directional migration from the Rubus to the grapevines was found. Furthermore, no evidence was found to indicate that morphologically distinct short- and long-distance fliers, as found in Cicadulina species by Rose (1972 b), exist in the A. lineatifrons population. Host preference tests also showed that adult leafhoppers apparently have no significant preference for grapevines to Rubus or vice versa. It seems, therefore, that the leafhoppers' move onto the grapevines at the beginning of the growing season is not prompted by a host preference. Chaboussou (1971) suggested that certain organic fungicides may cause leafhopper outbreaks because they affect the suitability of the vines as host plants and alter leafhopper fecundity. The effect of Mikal-M (active ingredient Fosetyl AL/Mancozeb), a systemic dithiocarbanate fungicide, on A. lineatifrons was investigated. Laboratory experiments showed no significant effect on fecundity and leaf analysis of potted vines treated with Mikal-M indicated no significant difference in total leaf nitrogen compared to untreated control plants. However, the field experiment on the effect of Mikal-M on the population build-up of the leafhopper showed that significantly more leafhoppers occurred on the vines treated with Mikal-M than on those treated with a conventional <b>inorganic</b> <b>fungicide,</b> copper oxychloride. In view of the far-reaching implications this can have on the viticultural industry, further research on the effects of organic fungicides on leafhopper populations is recommended to confirm the generality of these results so that recommendations regarding the use of these fungicides may be made. The question as to why A. lineatifrons became a pest only recently was raised. Three possibilities were considered, namely (1) that A. lineatifrons is a species of tropical origin which moved down the continent and became established in the Western Cape only recently, (2) that is has been in the Western Cape at least as long as the grapevines, but required prolonged exposure to establish itself on the new host and (3) that is has been on the vines for some time, but was noticed only recently when outbreaks occurred. These outbreaks could have been caused by the introduction of organic fungicides or the depletion of natural enemies by insecticides used to control other insects in the vineyards. Due to the lack of evidence this question could not be answered conclusively. Other research priorities that were established are the development of methods for damage assessment and monitoring of leafhopper populations, determining if A. lineatifrons can transmit grapevine virusses, the development of an economic threshold level and the identification of natural enemies of A. lineatifrons to enable the development of efficient pest management strategies (Summary, p. 63 - 65...|$|R
40|$|In a field {{experiment}} conducted over two growing seasons, the effectiveness and phytotoxicity of <b>inorganic</b> <b>fungicides</b> such as sulphur, lime sulphur, copper, silicon and Armicarb (a new formulation of potassium bicarbonate) was compared with {{water for the}} control of primary apple scab infections in Belgium on high, medium and low scab-susceptible cultivars (cvs. ‘Pinova’, ‘Pirouette’ and ‘Reinette des Capucins’, respectively). In order to drastically {{reduce the amount of}} fungicide applied in the orchard, two approaches were used: (i) a strategy involving spraying during the infection process, just before conditions for infection had been fulfilled according to the RIMpro software warning system; and (ii) a tunnel sprayer machine for treatment applications. Under field conditions that were highly favourable for disease, low rates of elemental sulphur (31. 8 and 38. 6 kg ha- 1 year- 1 in 2005 and 2006, respectively) combined with low rates of copper (2. 1 kg ha- 1 year- 1 in both years) provided the best scab control and reduced its severity on the fruits of cv. ‘Pinova’ by 97 and 98 % compared with water control in 2005 and 2006, respectively. Lime sulphur was much more effective than wettable sulphur and appeared to be efficient at temperatures below 10 °C, but its effectiveness against apple scab decreased if the treatments were applied 12 – 24 h later than in the ‘during-infection’ spray strategy. Armicarb used alone significantly reduced apple scab severity on the leaves and fruits of the three cultivars compared with water control. Its effectiveness was as good as wettable sulphur applied using the same timing and dosage. Silicon reduced apple scab on fruits very slightly, but not on leaves. The amounts of wettable sulphur, lime sulphur, copper, silicon and potassium bicarbonate used in this experiment to control apple scab were not phytotoxic, did not increase fruit russet, did increase the yield of each cultivar and did not affect summer density of the beneficial Typhlodromus pyri. The potential and limitations of the ‘during-infection’ spray strategy as protection methods against apple scab in organic farming are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The Project {{aimed at}} {{improving}} disease control, {{which is one of}} the main and most difficult tasks in organic viticulture, integrating plant resistance against pathogens, cropping practices, use of weather-driven disease models, and use of biocontrol agents (BCAs). All these aspects were firstly considered separately in each WP by the competent partners, then efforts were made to develop innovative vineyard management strategies that consider all these aspects. All plants have an innate immunity against pathogenic fungi and oomycetes that is triggered by pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Repeated application of these molecules or their structural analogues can activate and enhance the innate defence response against a following infection by pathogens. During the project, 85 substances were tested, 26 were able to induce a pH-shift or demonstrated to have some cytotoxic activities, 11 were further analysed in pathogen-leaf-disc assays and demonstrated to reduce downy mildew sporulation. One substance achieved promising results also in field experiments. Different methods for manipulating vegetative growth, canopy density, and fruit exposure were evaluated as a means for making the microclimate less favourable to pathogens and more ideal for the ripeness of the grapes. The first leaves of each shoot were removed at pre-flowering (ELR) and at pre-veraison, and compared to control vines in Italian, Spanish and Austrian vineyards. ELR was effective in reducing bunch sensitivity to grey mould by reducing bunch compactness and increasing berry skin thickness. Both treatments did not affect the titratable acidity of the musts, while ELR increased the tartaric acid suggesting the possibility to obtain more balanced wines by preserving acidity. Above-bunch-zone leaf removal applied at pre- and post-veraison was also tested on potted vines and compared to untreated vines. The results are very promising in that defoliation was effective in temporarily delaying technological maturity without affecting bunch colour and the content of phenoles. Other treatments, such as anti-transiprant application and “cutting off parts of bunches” were also tested. Existing models for predicting plant disease outbreaks/epidemics were evaluated for their ability to support decision-making about crop protection, based on the presence of favorable environmental conditions and/or biological information concerning the disease and/or the host plant. Mechanistic, weather-driven models for downy and powdery mildews were implemented in a web-based platform provided by Horta s. r. l., able to produce decision-aids for crop protection in organic viticulture. Fitness and efficacy of biocontrol agents, representing formulations of bacteria and fungi already registered in Europe, were evaluated in relation to grape pest and disease control under organic practices. Strain-specific detection systems were developed and tested in controlled and natural conditions. Experiments in controlled and natural conditions were performed to test the compatibility of different BCAs and <b>inorganic</b> <b>fungicides</b> for mixed or sequential application and it was demonstrated that sulphur can enhance the efficacy of the product SerenadeTM. Two innovative management strategies were designed, evaluated through an ex-ante assessment, and tested in different experimental vineyards set up in Italy, Austria, Germany and Slovenia. A first “risk-adverse strategy” is based on the combination of: i) fall treatments with the hyperparasite Ampelomyces spp. for the reduction of the overwintering chasmothecia of Erysiphe necator, ii) the web-portal with models for the prediction of downy and powdery mildews to schedule copper and sulphur treatments at label dose during the season; iii) use of BCAs for the control of grey mold. A second “risk-seeking strategy” is based only on: i) low-dose copper and sulphur applications according to the models and ii) early leaf removal for the control of grey mould. In general, the use of epidemiological models allowed a significant reduction of fungicides, with a consequent reduction of the costs for disease management and the ecotoxicity risk, as well as an increased social acceptability of the vineyard management. Finally, to test whether the innovative management strategies can increase overall numbers of species inhabiting the grapevines, appropriate culture-depended and culture-independent methods were implemented and applied on samples form the experimental vineyard in Slovenia. Unfortunately, the applied methods could not show that the different management strategies had a significant effect on the fungal species profiles, but very interesting fungal species were detected and the retrieved culture collection represents an important resource for future studies...|$|E
