40|$|The first 4 {{months of}} Mariner 9 {{photography}} {{of the south}} polar region are discussed. Three major geological units have been recognized, separated by erosional unconformities. From oldest to youngest they are: cratered terrain, pitted plains, and laminated terrain. The latter unit is unique in occurrence to the polar region, volatiles are probably involved in its origin, and may still be present within the laminated terrain as layered ice. The residual south polar cap has been observed to survive {{the disappearance of the}} thin annual CO 2 <b>frost</b> <b>deposit</b> and to last virtually unchanged in outline through the southern summer. That exposed deposit is inferred to be composed of water-ice. The residual cap appears to lie at the apex of an unusual quasi-circular structure composed of laminated terrain; a similar structure also appears to exist near the north pole...|$|E

Evidence is presented showing that the surface of Mars is strongly nonhomogeneous in its thermal properties, on scales ranging from those of the classical light and dark areas to the limit of resolution of the radiometers. On the sunlit side, the mean thermal inertia, for admissible bolometric albedos, is 0. 006 (cal cm^(- 2) sec^(- 1 / 2) °K^(- 1)). The dark areas Syrtis Major and Mare Tyrrhenum, observed at night, require thermal inertias as high as 0. 010. The temperatures measured over the circular basin Hellas require a bolometric albedo of 0. 40 and also a high thermal inertia.

40|$|A {{new model}} for the basal {{pressure}} of Io's atmosphere is developed. This model {{takes into account the}} previously ignored fact that much of Io's surface has very high porosity, typically about 90 pct. Such porosity allows efficient subsurface cold trapping of atmospheric gases which tends to keep ambient surface pressures very low. SO 2 is the only gas identified on Io, and the basal pressures for atmospheric models are usually pegged to local surface temperature via the SO 2 vapor pressure equilibrium curve. Near Io's subsolar point the pressure in equilibrium with a surface SO 2 <b>frost</b> <b>deposit</b> is about 1 / 10, 000, 000 th bar. Porous surface models of the type developed invoke equilibrium with the colder, subsurface permafrost (at about 3 -cm depth) and yield pressures of about 1 / 10 to the 12 th bar. The subsurface cold trapping model explains many but not all observations relevant to Io's atmosphere. The new subsurface cold trapping model and the earlier surface frost equilibrium model, when taken together, provide lower and upper limits, respectively, on the basal SO 2 pressure of Io's atmosphere...|$|E
40|$|Results are {{presented}} for the aerodynamic characteristics of NACA 0012 aerofoil section at Reynolds numbers of 2 - 88 x 106 and 1. 44 x 10 6 with some indications of scale effect at other Reynolds numbers. The measurement of CLmax at a Reynolds number of 2 - 88 x 10 6 is uncertain for two reasons. On the one hand, a laminar separation bubble disappears intermittently {{for reasons that}} are not fully understood. On the other, {{it was found that the}} flow broke down into a three-dimensional pattern when an appreciable extent of separation was present. This is a major problem. Boundary-layer control by suction in the vicinity of the wing/wall junction is shown to improve the two-dimensionality in the early stages of separation, but does not inhibit the appearance of three-dimensional flow at and beyond the stall. Distributed roughness was progressively applied from the trailing edge forwards over the upper surface of the aerofoil. Both sparse and dense distributions were used and they were intended to simulate the hoar <b>frost</b> <b>deposit</b> remaining after partial cleaning of the forward part of the aerofoil.

On Mars, the potential climatic effects of these perturbations are large because the mass of the Martian atmosphere may be determined by the vapor pressures of semipermanent CO 2 <b>frost</b> <b>deposits</b> at the poles. The Viking Orbiter observations of the Martian polar caps suggest that the sensitivity of the Martian climate system to the {{variations in the}} polar insolation may be considerably reduced by the tendency for polar <b>frost</b> <b>deposits</b> to become brighter with increasing rates of incident solar radiation.

Data {{collected at the}} NASA Infrared Telescope Facility using protocam, a 62 x 58 InSb array camera with a circular variable filter and a plate scale 0. 2 arc-seconds/pixel, are discussed. These images are a first attempt at extended seasonal infrared coverage of Mars to look for seasonal variations. Currently, data collected in Jun. 1990 at Ls = 241 (southern spring) and in Jan. 1991 Ls = 360 (late southern summer) are being reduced and analyzed. The 3 micron bound water band is the strongest surface absorption feature on Mars in the infrared. Infrared spectroscopy can also be useful in the detection of ice and frost deposits, especially in the polar regions. While imaging and spectroscopy at visible wavelengths allows {{for the detection of}} condensates, infrared information is needed to distinguish between water and CO 2 ice/frost deposits. In the Jun. images, the southern polar cap totally disappears in the 3. 4 micron CO 2 frost band and is bright in the 3. 1 micron water ice band, indicating that water ice is not a detectable component of the southern polar cap at this season. Further investigations are currently under way to look for residual water ice after the disappearance of the seasonal south polar cap in the Jan. images. The Jun. images that were focused on had a sub-earth point located at 184 longitude, and 23. 8 S latitude which put the center of the disk in the southern highland region between Elysium and Amazonis. Examination of the Jun. images show that there are four surface units identifiable: a CO 2 <b>frost</b> <b>deposit,</b> a northern plains unit, an equatorial unit, and a southern highland unit. At this resolution there {{does not appear to be}} any latitudinal variations in the 3 micron band that is independent of the 2. 4 micron albedo features. The northern planes unit and the southern highland unit have very similar 'color' in the three micron band as demonstrated by the rise out of the band, but different brightness levels. The equatorial unit has a distinct three micron color implying a compositional difference.

40|$|Photographic {{evidence}} suggests that many topographic features of the polar regions of Mars may have been sculptured by wind action.

Small-scale flutes and other textures of laminated terrain recognized outside the perennial ice cap in the south polar region are also attributed to eolian action. Winds flowing off the polar cap and spiraling toward the west seem to be responsible.

40|$|Abstract: Air/water {{heat pumps}} for heating systems are {{becoming}} increasingly popular. A major challenge for these systems is the formation of ice and frost in the fin-tube evaporator. Defrosting is usually accomplished by the reverse-cycle or hot-gas defrosting technique. In both defrosting modes, the compressor is in operation. An alternative method is ambient-air defrosting, where the heat pump’s compressor is simply turned off and defrosting is achieved by exposure to ambient air, which is conveyed through the fin tube evaporator by the fan. A model has been developed which permits the calculation of the simultaneous heat and mass transfer during the melting of ice and <b>frost</b> <b>deposits.</b> The theoretical results have been validated by numerous defrosting experiments. The theoretical and experimental investigations revealed that both temperature and humidity of the ambient air strongly influence the total heat flow and the time needed for defrosting. Already at an ambient air temperature of 2 °C and a dew point temperature of 0 °C, the heat flow of ambient-air defrosting is {{comparable to that of}} hot-gas defrosting; energy consumption is decreased by a factor of 8 – 10, however. On the other hand, ambient-air defrosting is less effective at air conditions below the extended fog-isotherm at 0 °C.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the first {{measurements of the}} annual heat budgets of the polar caps of Mars from spacecraft observations. The primary motivation for this work is to understand why seasonal CO_ 2 <b>frost</b> <b>deposits</b> at the north pole of Mars disappear in the summer, whereas seasonal CO_ 2 deposits near the south pole do not. This behavior {{is not expected to}} first order because both Martian poles receive the same total amount of sunlight {{at the top of the}} atmosphere over the course of a year. Understanding why the Martian north and south polar caps behave in an asymmetric fashion is important because the vapor pressures of permanent polar CO_ 2 deposits determine the planet-wide surface pressures of CO_ 2 gas, which is the dominant constituent of the Martian atmosphere. Annual radiation budgets for the core regions of the north and south polar caps are determined from solar reflectance and infrared emission observations obtained by the Infrared Thermal Mappers (IRTMs) aboard the two Viking orbiters. The results show that the absence of CO_ 2 frost at the north pole during summer is primarily due to an asymmetry in the rates of CO_ 2 frost sublimation at surface in the north and south during spring.

40|$|We {{present for}} the first time an {{assimilation}} of Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) water vapour column data into a Mars global climate model (MGCM). We discuss the seasonal cycle of water vapour, the processes responsible for the observed water vapour distribution, and the cross-hemispheric water transport. The assimilation scheme is shown to be robust in producing consistent reanalyses, and the global water vapour column error is reduced to around 2 – 4 pr μm depending on season. Wave activity is shown {{to play an important role}} in the water vapour distribution, with topographically steered flows around the Hellas and Argyre basins acting to increase transport in these regions in all seasons. At high northern latitudes, zonal wavenumber 1 and 2 stationary waves during northern summer are responsible for spreading the sublimed water vapour away from the pole. Transport by the zonal wavenumber 2 waves occurs primarily to the west of Tharsis and Arabia Terra and, combined with the effects of western boundary currents, this leads to peak water vapour column abundances here as observed by numerous spacecraft. A net transport of water to the northern hemisphere over the course of one Mars year is calculated, primarily because of the large northwards flux of water vapour which occurs during the local dust storm around L s = 240 - 260 °. Finally, outlying <b>frost</b> <b>deposits</b> that surround the north polar cap are shown to be important in creating the peak water vapour column abundances observed during northern summer...|$|R
40|$|The {{advance and}} retreat {{of the polar}} caps {{were one of the}} first {{observations}} that indicated Mars had seasons. Because {{a large portion of the}} atmosphere is cycled in and out of the seasonal caps during the year, the <b>frost</b> <b>deposits</b> play a significant role in regional and global atmospheric circulation. Understanding the nature of the seasonal polar caps is imperative if we are to understand the current Martian climate. In this study, we track the seasonal cap edges as a function of season and longitude for the fall and winter seasons (MY 27), using data from the Planetary Fourier Spectrometer (PFS) onboard the Mars Express (MEX) ESA mission. Making use of the rapid rise (decrease) in surface temperature that occurs when CO 2 ice is removed (deposited), in a first approach, we defined the advancing cap edge to be where the surface temperature drops below 150 K, and the retreating cap edge where the surface temperature rises above 160 K. In this case, starting from Lsnot, vert, similar 50 °, the edge progression speed start to be longitude dependent. In the hemisphere that extends form the eastern limit of the Hellas basin to the western limit of the Argyrae basin (and containing the two) the edges progression speed is about a half than that of the other hemisphere; the cap is thus asymmetric and, unexpectedly, no CO 2 ice seems to be present inside the basins. This is because the above mentioned surface temperatures used in this approach to detect the cap edges are not adequate (too low) for the high-pressure regions inside the basins where, following the Clausius–Clapeyron's law, the CO 2 condensation temperature can be several degrees higher than that of the adjacent lower-pressure regions. In the second, final approach, special attention has been given to this aspect and the advancing and retreating cap edges are defined where, respectively, the surface temperatures drop below and rise above the CO 2 condensation temperature for the actual surface pressure values. Now, the results show an opposite situation than the previous one, with the progression speed being higher and the cap more extended (up to − 30 ° latitude) in the hemisphere containing the two major Martian basins. During the fall season, up to Lsnot, vert, similar 50 ° the South Martian polar cap consists of CO 2 <b>frost</b> <b>deposits</b> that advance towards lower latitudes at a constant speed of 10 ° of latitude per 15 degrees of Ls. The maximum extension (− 40 ° latitude) of the South polar cap occurs somewhere in the 80 °– 90 ° Ls range.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted on}} the effect of frost fonnation on the perfonnance evaporator coils typically found in domestic refrigerator-freezers. The effect of fin spacing on evaporator perfonnance was also studied. The study was carried out by setting the conditions of air inlet temperature, air inlet relative humidity, and refrigerant inlet temperature, and by varying the volumetric airflow rate over a wide range to study its effect on the evaporator overall heat transfer coefficient and the evaporator pressure drop. These values were monitored while frost accumulated on the evaporator over a ten hour period. The data was modeled using a least-squares curve fit where the heat transfer coefficient and the pressure drop were taken to be functions of the airflow rate and the mass of accumulated frost. Using a characteristic fan curve and the models for the heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop, conditions closely emulating actual systems were simulated and the actual variation of heat transfer coefficient as a function of accumulated frost was found It showed the expected trend of rising to a point and then dropping off. The overall heat transfer coefficient increased up to 40 % of its starting value and was reached after the airflow rate had decreased to about 70 % of its starting value. These were dependent on the fan characteristic curve that was used. The effect of fin spacing was studied by comparing a 5 fin per inch evaporator to a 2. 5 fin per inch evaporator.
