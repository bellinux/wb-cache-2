Nearly all divergence from this pattern {{can be referred to}} as the activities of children, the products and workshops of which have previously been identified.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the functions of chipped and ground stone tools from the coast of Karaga Bay in Northeastern Kamchatka, Russia. The specimens analyzed include 27 stone tools restored after the excavations at the Karaga 6 (11 th to 13 th centuries) {{as well as the}} Karaga 10 and 13 (15 th to 17 th centuries) sites in 2012. The high-power approach of the lithic use-wear analysis was applied. Because of microscopic observations, six specimens displayed distinct use-wear polish. Polish morphology indicated that two utilized flakes and a retouched flake were used for hide working, while a side scraper exhibited a use-wear polish that was mainly generated by plant working. Two end scrapers also showed traces of plant working,whereas evidence of <b>dry</b> <b>hide</b> tanning was found on one specimen. The findings show that utilized or retouched flakes, not end scrapers, were the main tools for hide working from the 11 th to 17 th centuries C. E. in Northeastern Kamchatka. This result is extremely suggestive for the explanation concerning the diffusion process of the Paleo-Asiatic type scrapers that have been used by the indigenous peoples in Kamchatka.

40|$|The {{role played}} by the Magdalenian site of El Horno {{in the context of the}} Asón river basin (northern Spain) is {{considered}} in relation to its location and the physical characteristics of the surrounding area. This information has been integrated with data from the archaeological study. Special attention has been paid to the lithic tools and mammal remains recovered in the excavation as these played a particularly significant role at the site. The results suggest that the cave was occupied on a relatively stable basis although the situation changed in the course of the sequence. Level 1 reflects an occupation linked to the acquisition of meat and animal skins, worked mainly in a fresh state. The use of the site represented by Level 2 may have been more stable and complex, as this level displays greater functional diversity. Tasks involving hard animal material have been documented, as well as <b>dry</b> <b>hide</b> or leather processing. In addition, lithic reduction seems to have been more intense in Level 2. The excavation at El Horno was funded by the Government of Cantabria and El Mirón Project. The Human Sciences Department at the University of La Rioja funded the transportation of lithic material to be studied at the Institution Milà and Fontanals e CSIC (Barcelona) and the University of the Basque Country (Vitoria).

40|$|Techno-morphological and {{functional}} examination of flint and obsidiean artefacts with «plant gloss» from Franchthi Cave have revealed considerable diversity in manufacture, use and re-use. Flakes and blades of local flint {{were used for}} a short time only and soon discarded. Blades of Melian obsidian were more intensively used, showing a distinctive pattern of intentional retouch and edge damage. Imported flint blades were even more intensively used, frequently through a number of cycles of use and re-sharpening; they were then often used on <b>dry</b> <b>hide,</b> and often finally remorked into a range of other tool types. While there are some differences in chronological distribution, the wide diversity of artefacts with «plant gloss» within the same phase suggests a range of plant-related activities. Most surprising is that all these artefacts with «plant gloss» are restricted to a limited time zone within the Neolithic period (Early and Middle Neolithic : ca. 5700 - 4700 b. c.), while cereal remains are just as frequently encountered in earlier (Mesolithic and aceramic Neolithic) and later (Late and Final Neolithic) phases. This suggests, first, either that they were brought to the site as processed grain, or, more probably, that they were harvested without sickles; and, second, that the presence at the site of a variety of artefacts with «plant gloss» may indicate phases of more sedentary occupation, during which a wide range of plant related activities such as basketry, matting, thatching and fodder-collection may have taken place.

40|$|Umingmak» is {{situated}} in {{the central part of}} Banks Island (N. W. T., Canada). Mainly by evidence of its lithic inventar it is dated in a relatively advanced phase of the « Pre-Dorset-Culture », that means in C 14 years around 3500 B. P. Because of the tininess of the stone tools the heading «Arctic Small Tool Tradition» was placed over assemblage like ours. Botanical and zoological analyses have yield the result, that Umingmak must have been a summer camp with repeated visits to carry out butchering and meat processing tasks. The size of the bifacially retouched burins ranges between 5 to 30 mm. This implies that an efficient employment of these tools is only possible with a hafting device. A combined microwear analysis showed that the tools were used for two tasks in differing importance: 1. transversal scraping and smoothing of hard materials, most likely fresh or soaked reindeer with the lateral burin edges; 2. grooving or engraving of another hard material, probably bone, with the tip of the tool. Refitted burin spalls are demonstrating that during utilization the burin facet was commonly resharpened several times. Basic requirement for such an intensive usage is an optimal fixed junction between stone inset and handle. Micropolish spots on ridges and elevations in the proximal or grip part of the burins are interpreted as the results of a leather or <b>dry</b> <b>hide</b> covering in connection with the hafting arrangement. Grinding as a cultural important and wide spread aspect in the «Artie Small Tool Tradition» may also be part of the hafting design. Complete finds of handles with stone insets from younger periods in that region can give us an impression how the implement could have looked like. Analogous to these examples and knowing that the leather spots are present on both sides it is supposed that a small patch of leather was squeezed between the wooden handle and the flint burin. Organic residues which were preserved on some tools, can be interpreted as an additional means to cement the inset with covering. This leather « pad » arrangement has several advantages: – enhancing the contact surface and thereby the adherence between stone inset and handle – protecting the handle against damage from the inset – quick interchangeability – saving time and energy, which would otherwise be necessary for the skillful adjustment of the handle by whittling.

30|$|However, {{during the}} last few years, the export of live animals from Somaliland has been slowing, leading to the decline in {{national}} earning (SLCCIA 2015; SLCCIA 2016), and reducing pastoralists’ income. Adding value to the livestock and livestock products provides an avenue for reversing the declining incomes and sustaining the livelihoods of pastoralists. This can be achieved by slaughtering, processing and exporting meat (chilled carcasses or packaged meat) and by investing in the transformation and processing of livestock by-products like hides and skins, and bones, tallow and horns. Previous studies have shown that slaughtering and exporting processed meat involve higher costs of refrigeration (high costs of electricity in Somaliland) and transport to the importing countries (Negassa et al. 2012). On the other hand, improving the quality of hides and skins produced and developing the value chain beyond the wet blue tanning offer a more viable investment than exports of raw wet or <b>dried</b> <b>hides</b> and skins (Wanyoike et al. 2018). The same applies to harnessing and processing of tallow, bones and horns into an array of products that include soap, cooking oil and candles (from tallow) as well as an assortment of bone trinkets (jewellery, buttons, carvings etc.) from bones and horns.

Samples taken 2 hours after slaughter and samples delivered without treatment. The bacterial damage was clear in {{raw hides and skins}} delivered without treatment. They showed signs of putrefaction, offensive odour and hair slipping. A number of bacteria were isolated. A number of bacteria were isolated also from traditional salted hides and skins and this was probably due to delay in curing and absence of bacteriocides. A number of bacteria were isolated from samples taken from washed and air <b>dried</b> <b>hides</b> and skins and samples 2 hours taken after slaughter, this probably due to poor hygiene, large number of labors and bad condition of collection room of raw hides and skins. A total of 414 organisms were isolated and consist of 379 Grampositive bacteria and 35 were Gram- negative bacteria. One hundred and thirty four bacterial strains were isolated from fresh and washed cattle hides and sheep skins in slaughterhouse these include: Staphylococcus spp, Micrococcus spp, Corynebacterium spp, Aerococcus homorri, Enterococcus casselifarus, Aerococcus viridans, Enterococcus faecalis, Gamella haemolysan, Stomococcus spp, Pseudomonas spp and Eschericha coli.
