ICTs focus excessively on retributory justice, with an inflexible format that does not adapt to local circumstances. TRCs are much more flexible and locally responsive but suffer from under-funding, corruption, and accusations of local political partisanship. An International Truth and Reconciliation Commission (ITRC) would sponsor TRC formation and operations as well as post-commission activities.

40|$|Intergovernmental {{agreements}} {{are a common}} and useful instrument in federal systems, serving a variety of purposes from establishing new social programs, regulating agricultural practices, and even changing a country 2 ̆ 7 s constitution. Despite their importance, there have only been limited attempts to understand agreements in a comparative context or to provide a theoretical framework for their study. This dissertation addresses both of these deficiencies by comparing the use of agreements in seven federations and considering why certain federations form more agreements than others. In order to understand these differences in intergovernmental <b>agreement</b> <b>formation,</b> this thesis proposes an institutionalist approach with two components. First, {{agreements are}} defined as intergovernmental institutions, and thus, their creation is characterized {{as a process of}} institutional formation. Second, seven institutional variables are proposed as factors which are expected to affect the likelihood that a federation will form agreements. These are: the constitutional division of powers (including centralization and overlap), the existence of intrastate federalism, the size and status of the federal spending power, the size of the welfare state, the number of constituent units and the presence of lasting forums for intergovernmental relations. To test these hypotheses, data were gathered from seven federal systems, including two nascent ones: Australia, Canada, Germany, South Africa, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. Each federation and its record of intergovernmental <b>agreement</b> <b>formation</b> is examined qualitatively in light of each of the seven variables. The results of the individual country studies are then compared to determine whether the institutional approach provides a consistent explanation of <b>agreement</b> <b>formation.</b> This analysis finds that the <b>formation</b> of intergovernmental <b>agreements</b> seems to be greatly influenced by the institutional environment. While each hypothesis was not confirmed in every case, in unison they provide a comprehensive explanation for the record of <b>agreement</b> <b>formation</b> in six of the seven federations. The institutional approach provided only a partial explanation in the German case, however, indicating that there are some shortcomings to this theory. Despite these limitations, this thesis represents an effective comparative approach to the study of agreements and a successful application of institutional theory in comparative politics...|$|R

40|$|Bilateral trade {{agreements}} have proliferated rapidly {{within the last}} two decades, growing into a dense network of multiple ties between countries. The spread of preferential {{trade agreements}} (PTAs), however, is not uniform: some countries have signed a multitude of deals, while others remain much less involved. This article presents a longitudinal network analysis method to analyze the patterns of the <b>formation</b> of trade <b>agreements,</b> based on the mutual codetermination of network structure and <b>agreement</b> <b>formation.</b> The findings suggest that PTAs spread endogenously because of structural arbitrage effects in the network, and that they establish a hierarchy among countries. Rich countries form ties {{with each other and}} middle-income countries, who themselves create a horizontal layer of PTAs, but least-developed countries are left behind and do not form many ties.

40|$|We {{present a}} model of {{endogenous}} <b>formation</b> of R&D <b>agreements</b> among firms in which also the timing of R&D investment is made endogenous. The purpose is to bridge two usually separate streams of literature, the noncooperative formation of R&D alliances and the endogenous timing literature. Our approach allows to consider the <b>formation</b> of R&D <b>agreements</b> over time. It is shown that, when both R&D spillovers and investment costs are sufficiently low, firms may find difficult to maintain a stable R&D agreement due to the strong incentive to invest noncooperatively as leaders. In such a case, to be stable a R&D agreement requires that the joint investment occurs at the initial stage, avoiding any delay. When instead R&D spillover rates are sufficiently high, the cooperation in R&D constitutes a profitable option, although firms also possess the incentive to sequence their investment over time. Finally, when spillovers are asymmetric and the knowledge leaks mainly from the leader to the follower, to invest as follower becomes extremely profitable, making R&D alliances hard to sustain unless firms strategically delay their joint investment in R&D.
