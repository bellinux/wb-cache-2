30|$|The tumor tissues {{were fixed}} in 10 % {{formalin}} and cryoprotected with 18 % sucrose solution.

50|$|Weigert's elastic stain is a {{combination}} of stains used in histology which is useful in identifying elastic fibers. Often orcein or {{a combination}} of resorcinol and fuchsine are used for staining. For counterstaining cell nuclei nuclear <b>fast</b> <b>red</b> or hematoxylin is also used. After applying elastic fibers show up blue coloured while cell nuclei gets red or blue.|$|R
40|$|A simple spectrophorometric {{method for}} the {{determination}} of secnidazole, niclosamide, nifuroxazide and sulphasalzine is described. The method is based on reduction of the nitro group present in secnidazole and niclosamide molecule using zinc powder and dilute hydrochloric acid followed by reaction with <b>fast</b> <b>red</b> B salt in presence of ammonium chloride and sodium hydroxide, while in case of nifuroxazide and sulphasalazine the reaction takes place directly without any prior reduction between the phenolic group present in each drug and <b>fast</b> <b>red</b> B salt in presence of sodium hydroxide. Beer's law is valid in the concentration ranges 2. 5 - 15, 1. 25 - 10, 2. 5 - 15, and 2. 5 - 13. 75 μg. mL- 1 for secnidazole, niclosamide, nifuroxazide and sulphasalazine respectively. The proposed method is applied successfully for the estimation of the mentioned drugs either in pure form or in their pharmaceutical formulations...|$|R
40|$|Ten adenoid cystic carcinomas were {{examined}} for elastic tissues. The principal stain used was a Verhoeff 2 ̆ 7 s hematoxylin, alcian blue, chlorantine <b>fast</b> <b>red</b> sequence. Eight of the lesions contained detectable amounts of elastic tissue and, of these, six contained relatively dense and extensive deposits. The elastic tissue occurs principally in linear and radial arrangements immediately {{adjacent to the}} islands of neoplastic cells. Small quantities were seen in spheres within the neoplastic islands. The background in which the elastic tissue formed was alcian blue positive and chlorantine <b>fast</b> <b>red</b> negative. Both epithelial and myoepithelial cells are present in these neoplasms, and the evidence supports the view that {{one or both of}} these is directly involved in the production of elastic tissues in adenoid cystic carcinomas. It would be reasonable to suspect that the myoepithelial cells may have this property, but the present study neither confirms nor denies this hypothesis...|$|R

Dark neurons were well stained with nuclear <b>fast</b> <b>red,</b> and clearly distinguishable from light neurons. The dark neurons were classified into active and resting types. Active types {{were characterized by}} their well developed Golgi's complexes. Resting types contained poorly developed Golgi's complexes. These findings indicate that active dark neurons are converted into the light neurons via resting dark neurons...|$|R
