50|$|In a {{double-acting}} steam engine, {{as used in}} {{a railway}} locomotive, {{the direction of the}} vertical thrust on the <b>slide</b> <b>bar</b> is always upwards when running forward. It varies from nothing at the end of stroke to a maximum at half stroke when the angle between the con-rod and crank are greatest. When the crank-pin drives the piston, as when coasting, the piston thrust is downwards. The position of maximum thrust is shown by the increased wear at the middle of the <b>slide</b> <b>bars.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Due to the {{technical}} {{factors such as}} analytical design and virtual prototyping, the simple but representative <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> was chosen in this paper and its mathematical model of working contour was established by using the analytic method. And then, the parameterized model and VRML file structural drawing of <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> were given by using double extrusion method. It was proved that {{the components of the}} tripod universal joint were formed easily by using the double extrusion method based on Extrusion nodes. In addition, the tripod universal joint assembly model was also accomplished by using Inline nodes and bottom-up assembling method...|$|R

25|$|The {{drive was}} on the {{trailing}} wheels and the <b>slide</b> <b>bars</b> were attached to a motion bracket just behind the leading wheels. The wheels themselves had twelve spokes and very large balance weights. The front pair of wheels of the engine were partially enclosed in splashers which did not come above the running plate.|$|R
25|$|A {{minor change}} to the {{appearance}} of the streamlining was the removal of the locomotives' solid cowcatcher and its replacement with a lattice type, after it was discovered that the original design created a partial vacuum behind the cowcatcher, sucking dust and grime into the <b>slide</b> <b>bars</b> for the centre cylinder, leading to maintenance problems.|$|R

5000|$|The Laramie has an {{automatic}} safety on the hammer {{consisting of a}} <b>sliding</b> <b>bar.</b> After each shot, the bar automatically positions itself between the hammer and the frame, preventing accidental discharge. [...] The bar also blocks the barrel releasing device and {{the rotation of the}} cylinder. The revolver can be transported safely when the hammer is in the half-cock notch, in this position the cylinder is able to rotate and the barrel can be opened for loading or unloading.|$|R
5000|$|A steel <b>bar,</b> {{also called}} <b>slide,</b> play <b>bar</b> and bottleneck, is a musical {{apparatus}} {{which is used}} to play on steel guitars. The steel bar can be wound around the fingers or just held in the hand. Instead of pressuring the strings on the neck of the guitar, the steel <b>bar</b> <b>slides</b> over the strings, which produces a glissando effect.|$|R
50|$|The transformer, oil {{operated}} {{main switch}} and stepping switch {{were located in}} the centre body. The power supply {{was obtained from the}} catenary via the two diamond-shaped pantographs mounted on each end body. At the start of a journey, both pantographs had to be lifted since they were only equipped with a single <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> without rocker. The cabinets for the reversing pole shunts and the brake resistors were mounted in front of the pantographs, towards the ends of the outer bodies.|$|R
50|$|Soon after {{entering}} service, problems were experienced with failing connecting rods, big end bearings breaking {{up as well}} as cracks developing in the motion girder of the Alligator crossheads. After investigations by SAR engineers with assistance from the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), the crossheads, <b>slide</b> <b>bars</b> and coupling rods were modified. The crossheads were converted to the multiple-bearing type with single guide bars while the three independent coupling rods were replaced with the more conventional single coupling rod with knuckle joints.|$|R
50|$|As for Stephenson's Killingworth {{locomotives}} of {{the year}} before, it had a centre-flue boiler with two vertical cylinders of about 9 × 24 in set into its top centreline. The cylinders drove <b>slide</b> <b>bar</b> mounted beams which turned crankshafts driving the axles through 2:1 reduction gears between the frames. It had a tall, tapering chimney, the lower part being surrounded by a feedwater heater. It would have weighed about 7.5 tons and had {{a top speed of}} around 4.5 mph and a load capacity of about 90 tons over a short distance.|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} we discuss the {{suitability}} of various equipment types used to capture the user’s subjective perceptual quality evaluation for video streams with time-variant quality. We present four basic types of testing equipment (mouse, joystick, throttle and <b>sliding</b> <b>bar).</b> Since method and equipment used for testing must not influence the test results, we analyzed the requirements for the testing equipment in general and in particular its usability and design features. Furthermore, we performed and evaluated an assessment of video quality using all presented tools. The evaluation allows us to propose the most appropriate testing tool for time-variant video quality.

50|$|The {{chromatic}} harmonica {{is a type}} of harmonica {{that uses}} a button-activated <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> to redirect air from the hole in the mouthpiece to the selected reed-plate desired. When the button is not pressed, an altered diatonic major scale of the key of the harmonica is available, while depressing the button accesses the same scale a semitone higher in each hole. Thus, the instrument is capable of playing the 12 notes of the Western chromatic scale. The chromatic harmonica can thus be contrasted with a standard harmonica, which can play only the notes in a given musical key.|$|R
50|$|Most {{retractable}} doors use a {{spring-loaded roller}} {{very similar to}} a window blind, except the roller is mounted vertically when used in a door application. Screen material {{is attached to the}} roller while {{the opposite side of the}} material is attached to <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> riding on top and bottom tracks. The bar is moved back and forth to open or close the screen. The bar is usually held closed with a magnetic closure. Different types of mesh fabric options are available from standard fiberglass mesh, pet screen resistant mesh and solar screen mesh. The operation of the screens are manually or motorized.|$|R
50|$|On October 25, 2013 a free-to-play {{spin-off}} mobile {{game called}} Blur Overdrive {{was released on}} Android, developed by Nottingham based App Crowd, and distributed by Marmalade, who licensed the Blur brand from Activision. An iOS version was released on November 1, 2013. Blur: Overdrive uses a top-down perspective and features eight different power-ups and six cars, which can be upgraded individually in ten steps. Touchscreen controls allow to choose from a floating steering wheel, a <b>slide</b> <b>bar</b> or a virtual pad. Player mods and Power Up mods are not connected to the car upgrading system and change how power-ups influence the combat.|$|R

40|$|Tradespace is {{the region}} within which {{modifications}} {{to achieve the}} maximum balance between cost, performance, and schedule reside. This space, however, is not always sufficiently broad to achieve the required, or optimal, system balance. When tradeoffs must be found and cost, schedule and performance can not be changed, what other system characteristics {{can be used as}} a tradeoff variable? This research explores use of the system’s concept of operations (CONOPs) as a new dimension of the tradespace. Specifically explored is why, when, and how the CONOPs {{can be used as a}} tradespace variable. In addition, several DoD systems are presented as case studies of CONOP use with trade assessments. Our research indicated that to remain within the tradespace, the CONOPs must continue to fulfill its intended role in the developmental process, and to function under specific constraints. Three distinct, but related elements serve as the upper limit of the CONOPs tradespace. These elements include: mission, system capability, and operational scenarios. Traditional Tradespace Traditionally, tradespace includes cost, schedule, & performance. These elements can be illustrated as <b>slide</b> <b>bars.</b> Changes can be made along any of the <b>slide</b> <b>bars</b> as long as the change is within the parameters of: desired and maximum cost, desired and maximum schedule, and minimum and desired performance.
