40|$|Vertical {{handover}} {{has emerged}} as a key component in the development of seamless connectivity framework for todayï¿½€™s heterogeneous wireless network environment with diverse access technologies. This work aims at enhancing the vertical handover experience for a multi-interface mobile node in a heterogeneous network environment and involves optimization of both <b>handover</b> <b>execution</b> and pre-execution preparation. In this endeavor, we have (i) come-up with a new technique for <b>handover</b> <b>execution,</b> (ii) developed a new handover necessity estimation method for a mobile node moving into a WLAN cell, (iii) mathematically modeled handover triggering condition estimation for a mobile node moving out of aWLAN coverage area, (iv) surveyed various techniques used for target network selection in a heterogeneous network environment, (v) surveyed and categorized <b>handover</b> <b>execution</b> techniques, (vi) suggested a criteria metrics for evaluation of <b>handover</b> <b>execution</b> techniques and (vii) analyzed the proposed <b>handover</b> <b>execution</b> technique against some of the parameters of the evaluation criteria metrics using NCTUns simulator. Finally, we have looked into some bleeding-edge vertical handover optimization techniques; particularly the utilization of RF coverage maps in handover decision process. The proposed vertical <b>handover</b> <b>execution</b> technique is an end-to-end, self-reliant scheme for a multi-interface mobile node, roaming in a heterogeneous network environment. The scheme neither requires rerouting nor the tunneling. Despite end-to-end signaling, the service disruption time is few milli-seconds as compared to hundreds of milli-seconds for existing techniques. The designed handover necessity estimation model, based on angle of arrival with respect to tangent, for limiting the unnecessary handovers and handover failures provides much better control than the existing model. Even at higher velocities, the deviation from the desired level is five times lower than the existing model. The suggested analytical model for handover triggering condition estimation for maximizing the connectivity with the preferred network, as opposed to existing models, does not make assumptions about the shape of the exit region and thus makes it more general. Performance of this model is identical to the existing model, which reveals that the choice of pdf of exit angle does not affect the performance of handover triggering condition estimation algorithm. The study of target network selection schemes considers traditional horizontal schemes, their adaptation in a heterogeneous network environment, more sophisticated schemes and also the fuzzy logic and neural network based schemes. The information required for each of the handover pre-execution decisions is identified and the methods for information collection are also studied. The detailed survey of vertical <b>handover</b> <b>execution</b> techniques is used for classification and identification of pros and cons associated with these diverse approaches. Use of RF coverage maps in handover decisions is a novel idea. Timely execution of the vertical handover with the help of RF coverage maps can ensure an uninterrupted communication for a multi-interface mobile node traversing the black spots. It has been demonstrated that this can help improve communication and optimize the handover process...|$|E

30|$|In summary, after {{reviewing}} the literature and from a <b>handover</b> process <b>execution</b> point of view, a single neighboring BS scanning strategy with proper parameter configuration should be promoted. Moreover, from a scheduling of the scanning process perspective, the closer to the handover initiation process the scanning process takes place, the better.|$|R
30|$|Service interruption, and {{consequently}} handover delay, in the RMPA <b>handover</b> <b>execution</b> stage is initiated when the MS switches channels {{to a new}} target BS. Since this target BS has information related to MAC synchronization, previously recorded during the scanning process, the MS directly initiates the ranging process.|$|E
30|$|The {{scanning}} process, in {{the standard}} specification and in general, although disruptive, is a necessary step prior to execution of the handover process. Most often, in power strength-based algorithms, RSSI measurements taken during this process feed the handover decision-making process, firing the LGD trigger, and initiating the <b>handover</b> <b>execution.</b>|$|E
40|$|In mobile {{networks}} handover is initiated {{when there}} is change in network Quality of Service (QoS) parameters such as signal strength, signal to interference noise ratio (SINR), bit error rate (BER) etc. Handover considering signal strength is a basic scheme in mobile networks. Considering only signal strength is not ideal for WiMAX networks, which has stringent QoS requirements. Signal strength along with hysteresis and threshold serves as an accurate handover mechanism in WiMAX network. But {{it is not necessary}} that selected target base station have enough capacity to handle the data of mobile station. In this paper we propose a multiple trigger initiated <b>handover</b> <b>execution</b> which considers the signal strength along with hysteresis and threshold during scanning phase and the estimation of free capacity during <b>handover</b> <b>execution</b> phase. We evaluate our proposed scheme in Opnet Modeler simulator and its performance is verified...|$|E
40|$|Femtocells are {{attracting}} a fast increasing interest nowadays, as a promising solution to improve indoor coverage and system capacity. Due {{to the short}} transmit-receive distance, femtocells can greatly lower transmit power, prolong handset battery life, and enhance the user-perceived Quality of Service (QoS). On the other hand, technical challenges still remain, mainly including interference mitigation, security and mobility management, intercepting wide deployment and adoption by both mobile operators and end users. This paper introduces a novel energy-centric handover decision policy and its accompanied algorithm, towards minimizing the power consumption at the mobile terminal side in the integrated LTE macrocell–femtocell network. The proposed policy is shown to extend the widely-adopted strongest cell policy, by suitably adapting the handover hysteresis margin in accordance with standardized LTE measurements on the tagged user’s neighbor cells. Performance evaluation results show that significantly lower interference and power consumption can be attained {{for the cost of}} a moderately increased number of network-wide <b>handover</b> <b>executions</b> events...|$|R
40|$|Femtocells {{will play}} a key role in future {{deployments}} of the 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) the Long Term Evolution (LTE) system, as they are expected to enhance system capacity, and greatly improve the energy-efficiency in a cost-effective manner. Due to the short transmit-receive distance, femtocells prolong handset battery life and enhance the Quality of Service (QoS) perceived by the end users. However, large-scale femtocell deployment comprises many technical challenges, mainly including security, interference and mobility management. Under the viewpoint of energy-efficient mobility management, this chapter discusses the key features of the femtocell technology and presents a novel energy-efficient handover decision policy for the macrocell – femtocell LTE network. The proposed HO decision policy aims at reducing the transmit power of the LTE mobile terminals in a backwards compatible with the standard LTE handover decision procedure. Simulation results show that significantly lower energy and power consumption can be attained if the proposed approach is employed, at the cost of a moderately increased number of <b>handover</b> <b>executions</b> events...|$|R
30|$|In the {{heterogeneous}} RAN, the WQB is {{in charge}} of the QoS management functions, while the CRRM module is responsible for the coordinated and efficient management of the pool of radio resources provided by each one of the individual RANs. More specifically, the WQB/CRRM performs three main functions. First, since each RAN may have specific QoS mechanisms, the WQB is responsible for monitoring and configuring the QoS mechanisms of each RAN in order to achieve the appropriate QoS provisioning. Thus, the WQB configures QoS mechanisms in RAN elements according to a set of common policies. Similarly, CRRM functions may also be configured from the WQB if required. Second, CRRM functions play a crucial role in the RAN and thus are jointly managed by the WQB/CRRM modules in order to guarantee the required QoS level during admission control and initial RAN selection procedures as well as preserve the provided QoS level during <b>handover</b> <b>executions</b> or other reconfiguration events. Finally, the WQB/CRRM takes local decisions on the QoS management in the RAN part whenever required (e.g., during admission control and/or handover procedures) according to radio resource usage, network topology, and traffic distribution constraints, and then dynamically negotiates QoS agreements with the CN part.|$|R
30|$|In {{the advent}} of HetNets, recent studies have {{demonstrated}} that HOFs and PPs can be serious problems due small cell sizes [2, 3]. MM mechanisms, which have been included in the first release of the long-term evolution (LTE) standard (Rel- 8), were originally developed for networks that only involve macrocells [4]. The defined MM procedures for the macrocell-only scenarios have been widely discussed in the literature, e.g., in [5 - 19]. It has been shown that MM for macrocell-only scenarios yield highly reliable <b>handover</b> <b>execution,</b> where HOFs and PPs can be typically avoided due to large cell sizes [20]. However, the deployment {{of a large number of}} small cells (e.g., femtocells, picocells, etc.) increases the complexity of MM in HetNets, since mobile UE may trigger frequent handovers when they traverse the coverage area of a small cell. This leads to less reliable <b>handover</b> <b>execution</b> in HetNets.|$|E
30|$|The LGD in the RMPA {{handover}} is triggered {{according to}} the RMPA handover policy mechanism embedded in the MS policy engine. It is not fired merely {{as a result of}} signal power degradation, information on distance to target BS is also relevant. Rule 3 in this section specifies when LGD trigger is fired. Once the LGD is fired, the MS sends the MOB_MSHO-REQ as shown in Figure 4 and initiates the <b>handover</b> <b>execution</b> process.|$|E
30|$|As a basic rule to be followed, {{predictive}} {{events such}} as LGD need to occur timorously {{to prepare for a}} handover. The LGD trigger should be invoked before an actual LD event by at least the time required to prepare and to execute a handover (anticipation factor or optimum threshold value). Thus, one of the most relevant attributes for timely link triggering is prior knowledge of the required time for <b>handover</b> <b>execution.</b>|$|E
30|$|Regarding the <b>handover</b> {{procedure}} or <b>execution</b> itself, the <b>handover</b> methods supported {{within the}} IEEE 802.16 standard {{can be classified}} into hard and soft handover. The four supported methods are HHO, optimized HHO, FBSS, and MDHO. Out of these, just the HHO (break before make) is mandatory {{and it is the}} only type required to be implemented by mobile WiMAX, {{at the time of this}} writing.|$|R
30|$|Regarding the RAN {{part of the}} testbed, {{the studies}} that {{can be carried out}} embrace the {{validation}} and performance evaluation of advanced RRM and cross-layer RRM algorithms for the specific technologies implemented in the testbed (see, e.g., [30]), including admission control, congestion control, power control, radio resource allocation, handover management, and transmission parameters management, and so forth. Another kind of studies related to the RAN part comprise the validation and performance evaluation of CRRM-related issues (see, e.g., [31, 32]), including CRRM architectures, inter-RAN communication mechanisms, RAN selection and load-sharing algorithms, and Vertical <b>Handover</b> (VHO) <b>execution</b> and coordination policies, among others. The development, assessment, and optimization of mechanisms allowing an automated tuning and self-optimization of the RRM/CRRM algorithms and their corresponding parameters are also possible.|$|R

30|$|This section {{explains}} the RMPA handover procedure. As previously mentioned, the RMPA handover strategy satisfies the IEEE 802.16 handover specification. Consequently, the RMPA handover strategy considers {{the same set}} of clearly identified stages in the IEEE 802.16 handover specification: network topology advertising, network topology acquisition, scanning, handover decision process, and <b>handover</b> <b>execution.</b> A concise description of the different stages in the IEEE 802.16 handover procedure, how the different stages are related to one another, and their order of execution is given in the Appendix I. Here, we present the details of the RMPA strategy in each stage of the IEEE 802.16 handover procedure.|$|E

30|$|SAIL adopts an ubiquitous, seamless, and {{transparent}} mobility approach. Mobility support is {{not restricted to}} hosts, it covers content (based on NetInf) and virtual entities (based on CloNe), e.g. processes and VMs. NetInf employs unique identification and decoupling from locators. Names are flat, persistent, non-legible, authenticated, and self-certifiable. At the open connectivity services (OConS) level, SAIL employs a dynamic, distributed mobility management solution. The solution is flow-based and includes information collection, network selection, path selection, <b>handover</b> decision making, <b>execution,</b> enforcement, and optimization. More specifically, a modified dynamic mobility anchoring technique is adopted [131].|$|R
40|$|The {{upcoming}} {{generation of}} wireless networks {{are characterized by}} seamless mobility across wireless access networks belonging to different radio access technologies. This requires the heterogeneous access networks to be integrated together, and the mobile terminals to be equipped with multiple radio interfaces allowing the users to roam across different networks. Vertical Handover (VHO) {{is the process of}} transparent switching from one access network to other. To achieve seamless heterogeneous mobility, simple, robust and effective vertical handover mechanisms must be devised. The entire vertical handover process can by divided into three stages: VHO Preparation, VHO Decision and VHO Execution. Ideally, a vertical handover should complete without causing any disruption in the communication and with a minimum overhead on the network. To achieve these goals, each of the three stages in VHO should be individually optimized. This research aims to devise a vertical handover implementation that performs as close to ideal behaviour as possible. For this purpose, we have proposed new or enhanced algorithms corresponding to all three VHO stages. A heterogeneous network model comprises of two major types of networks - cellular networks with wide coverage areas, and wireless local area networks (WLAN) with small coverage but providing higher bandwidth at a lower cost. To optimize the VHO preparation phase, we have developed a hybrid vertical handoff method for maximizing WLAN utilization in a WLAN-cellular integrated environment. We accurately determine the timing instants for initiation of vertical handover for the mobile terminals that enter the WiFi hotspots, stay there for some time and then leave the area. The proposed method ensures that transition between cellular and WiFi networks should be with minimum disruption while utilizing WiFi signals for as long as possible. As a result, the mobile nodes get advantages of lowest probability of handover failure and minimum number of unnecessary handovers. The second phase, VHO decision should incorporate multiple parameters to select the best network from a list of available candidate networks. The list of possible decision metrics includes link quality, system QoS parameters, user preferences, monetary cost, application type, movement speed etc. To arrive at a unified decision, as per our proposal, the best candidate network is chosen by employing a multiple-criteria decision making algorithm named PROMETHEE. This approach yields the desired benefit of providing better QoS experience to end users. For the third phase in vertical <b>handover</b> (VHO <b>execution),</b> we have focussed on the specific admission control problem. We have introduced concepts from Online Social Networking (OSN) Sites into admission control and handoff scenarios, by use of OSN proxy servers running on WLAN access points. Because of an ever-increasing popularity of OSNs this solution hold a lot of potential. Using the access points as OSN proxy servers leads to a substantial localization of social network traffic within WLAN which is a great advantage when considered globally. We have formulated and evaluated a Social-Connectivity-aware Vertical Handover (SCVH) algorithm for efficient dissemination of social network feeds. This algorithm introduces a novel measure of social importance of users requesting for admission to WLAN by calculating their 'graph centrality' measures. According to our proposed SCVH, users with high importance value are given a high priority for handover to WLAN network. Performance evaluation of our proposed techniques is carried out in a network simulation environment which models a heterogeneous network scenario. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed schemes are successful in optimizing VHO performance, which should result in a nearly seamless handover across heterogeneous wireless networks...|$|R

30|$|Real-time {{multimedia}} {{services such}} as voice over IP and interactive streaming {{become more and more}} popular in current wireless networks, so ubiquitous roaming support for real-time multimedia traffic in an access independent manner becomes increasingly important. Seamless mobility can be achieved by enabling mobile terminals to conduct seamless handovers across diverse access networks, that is, seamlessly transfer and continue their ongoing sessions from one access network to another. Vertical handover in the heterogeneous networks {{is one of the major}} challenges for seamless mobility with ubiquitous connectivity, since each access network may have different mobility, quality of service,Fn and security requirements [2]. Moreover, real-time applications have stringent performance requirements on end-to-end delay and packet loss. In general, the vertical handover process can be divided into three main phases, namely, system discovery, handover decision, and <b>handover</b> <b>execution</b> [3]. During the system discovery phase, the mobile terminals have to determine which networks can be used and the services available in each network. These wireless networks may also advertise the supported data rates for different services. During the handover decision phase, the mobile device determines which network it should connect to. The decision may depend on various parameters or handover metrics including the available bandwidth, delay, jitter, access cost, transmit power, current battery status of the mobile device, and even the user's preferences. Finally, during the <b>handover</b> <b>execution</b> phase, the connections need to be rerouted from the existing network to the new network in a seamless manner. This phase also includes the authentication and authorization, and the transfer of user's context information.|$|E

Reducing the authentication time over heterogeneous access networks involving interdomain mobility is a very critical criterion for seamless handover. In [3], Media independent preauthentication (MPA) provision is suggested. MPA provides {{a significant reduction in}} handover delays for both network-layer and application-layer mobility management protocols. However, the MPA scheme [3] does not address secure transport of media independent messages.|$|E

Nevertheless, soft handover strategies obviously offer significantly better handover performance compared with HHO. Their main drawback is that their deployment cost is considerably greater since they require a larger number of BSs within a specified area, perfect synchronization of the active or diversity set of BSs, and accurate sharing of the same frequency. All these issues are difficult to implement in a long distance deployment such as a high-speed railway.|$|E
