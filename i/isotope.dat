5|$|Actinium {{is found}} only in traces in uranium ores – one tonne of uranium in ore {{contains}} about 0.2 milligrams of 227Ac – and in thorium ores, which contain about 5 nanograms of 228Ac per one tonne of thorium. The actinium <b>isotope</b> 227Ac is a transient member of the uranium-actinium series decay chain, which begins with the parent <b>isotope</b> 235U (or 239Pu) and ends with the stable lead <b>isotope</b> 207Pb. The <b>isotope</b> 228Ac is a transient member of the thorium series decay chain, which begins with the parent <b>isotope</b> 232Th and ends with the stable lead <b>isotope</b> 208Pb. Another actinium <b>isotope</b> (225Ac) was transiently present in the neptunium series decay chain, beginning with 237Np (or 233U) and ending with thallium (205Tl) and near-stable bismuth (209Bi), but this chain existed only in the early Solar System, due to the short half-life of neptunium-237.|$|E
5|$|Another {{interesting}} for research <b>isotope</b> 245Cm {{can be obtained}} from the α-decay of 249Cf, and the latter <b>isotope</b> is produced in minute quantities from the β−-decay of the berkelium <b>isotope</b> 249Bk.|$|E
5|$|Each {{radioactive}} <b>isotope</b> has {{a characteristic}} decay time period—the half-life—that {{is determined by}} the amount of time needed for half of a sample to decay. This is an exponential decay process that steadily decreases the proportion of the remaining <b>isotope</b> by 50% every half-life. Hence after two half-lives have passed only 25% of the <b>isotope</b> is present, and so forth.|$|E
50|$|Although some helium <b>isotopes,</b> such as 6He and 8He, decay {{mostly to}} <b>isotopes</b> of lithium, the major {{tendency}} among known <b>isotopes</b> {{seems to be}} decay into lighter helium <b>isotopes.</b> Fission, seen only in even-numbered <b>isotopes,</b> is also unusually common.|$|R
25|$|The known <b>isotopes</b> {{of silicon}} range in mass number from 22 to 44. The most common decay mode of the <b>isotopes</b> with mass numbers {{lower than the}} three stable <b>isotopes</b> is inverse beta decay, {{primarily}} forming aluminium <b>isotopes</b> (13 protons) as decay products. The most common decay mode for the heavier unstable <b>isotopes</b> is beta decay, primarily forming phosphorus <b>isotopes</b> (15 protons) as decay products.|$|R
50|$|Among {{the lighter}} chalcogens (oxygen and sulfur), the most neutron-poor <b>isotopes</b> undergo proton emission, the {{moderately}} neutron-poor <b>isotopes</b> undergo electron capture or β+ decay, the moderately neutron-rich <b>isotopes</b> undergo β− decay, {{and the most}} neutron rich <b>isotopes</b> undergo neutron emission. The middle chalcogens (selenium and tellurium) have similar decay tendencies as the lighter chalcogens, but their <b>isotopes</b> do not undergo proton emission {{and some of the}} most neutron-starved <b>isotopes</b> of tellurium undergo alpha decay. Polonium's <b>isotopes</b> tend to decay with alpha or beta decay. <b>Isotopes</b> with nuclear spins are more common among the chalcogens selenium and tellurium than they are with sulfur.|$|R
5|$|Praseodymium {{has only}} one stable and {{naturally}} occurring <b>isotope,</b> 141Pr. It is thus a mononuclidic element, and its standard atomic weight can be determined with high precision. This <b>isotope</b> has 82 neutrons, a magic number that confers additional stability. This <b>isotope</b> is produced in stars through the s- and r-processes (slow and rapid neutron capture, respectively).|$|E
5|$|The {{daughter}} flerovium <b>isotope</b> had properties matching {{those of}} a flerovium <b>isotope</b> first synthesized in June 1999, which was originally assigned to 288Fl, implying an assignment of the parent livermorium <b>isotope</b> to 292Lv. Later work in December 2002 indicated that the synthesized flerovium <b>isotope</b> was actually 289Fl, and hence the assignment of the synthesized livermorium atom was correspondingly altered to 293Lv.|$|E
5|$|The major <b>isotope</b> of berkelium, 249Bk, is {{synthesized}} in minute quantities in dedicated high-flux nuclear reactors, mainly at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, USA, {{and at the}} Research Institute of Atomic Reactors in Dimitrovgrad, Russia. The {{production of}} the second-most important <b>isotope</b> 247Bk involves the irradiation of the rare <b>isotope</b> 244Cm with high-energy alpha particles.|$|E
50|$|In the {{radioactive}} processes, the three unstable parent <b>isotopes</b> decay into their respective stable daughter <b>isotopes</b> of Pb. Each following a decay chain consisting of alpha and beta decays, parent <b>isotopes</b> 238U, 235U and 232Th, decay {{into a series}} of intermediate daughter <b>isotopes,</b> and finally lead to stable <b>isotopes,</b> 206Pb, 207Pb and 208Pb, respectively. Each decay chain has a unique half-life, which means the daughter <b>isotopes</b> are generated at different rates.|$|R
50|$|The {{relative}} abundances {{of different}} <b>isotopes</b> are {{then used to}} describe the chemical fractionation of different <b>isotopes,</b> travel in different reservoirs of non-radiogenic <b>isotopes,</b> and age or origins of solar system objects by the presence of radiogenic daughter <b>isotopes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The long lived isotopes,146Sm, 147Sm, and 148Sm {{primarily}} decay by {{alpha decay}} to <b>isotopes</b> of neodymium. Lighter unstable <b>isotopes</b> of samarium primarily decay by electron capture to <b>isotopes</b> of promethium, while heavier ones decay by beta decay to <b>isotopes</b> of europium.|$|R
5|$|The undiscovered <b>isotope</b> 284Ds {{has been}} {{predicted}} {{to be the}} most stable towards beta decay; however, no known darmstadtium <b>isotope</b> has been observed to undergo beta decay. Theoretical calculation in a quantum tunneling model reproduces the experimental alpha decay half-life data for the known darmstadtium isotopes. It also predicts that the undiscovered <b>isotope</b> 294Ds, which has a magic number of neutrons (184), would have an alpha decay half-life on the order of 311years: exactly the same approach predicts a ~3500-year alpha half-life for the non-magic 293Ds <b>isotope,</b> however.|$|E
5|$|About twenty {{isotopes}} and six {{nuclear isomers}} (excited states of an <b>isotope)</b> of berkelium have been characterized with the mass numbers ranging from 235 to 254. All {{of them are}} radioactive. The longest half-lives are observed for 247Bk (1,380years), 248Bk (over300years) and 249Bk (330days); the half-lives of the other isotopes range from microseconds to several days. The <b>isotope</b> which is the easiest to synthesize is berkelium-249. This emits mostly soft β-particles which are inconvenient for detection. Its alpha radiation is rather weak – 1.45% {{with respect to the}} β-radiation – but is sometimes used to detect this <b>isotope.</b> The second important berkelium <b>isotope,</b> berkelium-247, is an alpha-emitter, as are most actinide isotopes.|$|E
5|$|All {{nihonium}} isotopes {{are extremely}} unstable and radioactive; however, the heavier nihonium isotopes are {{more stable than}} the lighter. The most stable known nihonium <b>isotope,</b> 286Nh, is also the heaviest confirmed nihonium isotope; it has a half-life of 8seconds. The <b>isotope</b> 285Nh and the unconfirmed 290Nh {{have been reported to}} also have half-lives of over a second. The isotopes 284Nh and 283Nh have half-lives of 1 and 0.1seconds respectively. The remaining two isotopes have half-lives between 0.1 and 100milliseconds: 282Nh has a half-life of 70milliseconds, and 278Nh, the lightest known nihonium <b>isotope,</b> is also the shortest-lived known nihonium <b>isotope,</b> with a half-life of just 1.4milliseconds. It is predicted that even heavier undiscovered nihonium isotopes could be much more stable: for example, 287Nh is predicted to have a half-life of around 20minutes, close to two orders of magnitude more than that of 286Nh.|$|E
5|$|The {{long-lived}} isotopes,146Sm, 147Sm, and 148Sm, primarily decay by {{emission of}} alpha particles to <b>isotopes</b> of neodymium. Lighter unstable <b>isotopes</b> of samarium primarily decay by electron capture to <b>isotopes</b> of promethium, while heavier ones convert through beta decay to <b>isotopes</b> of europium.|$|R
50|$|For radiogenic <b>isotopes</b> that decay slowly enough, or {{that are}} stable <b>isotopes,</b> a {{primordial}} fraction is always present, since all sufficiently long-lived and stable <b>isotopes</b> {{do in fact}} naturally occur primordially. An additional fraction {{of some of these}} <b>isotopes</b> may also occur radiogenically.|$|R
50|$|The {{long-lived}} isotopes,146Sm, 147Sm, and 148Sm, primarily decay by {{emission of}} alpha particles to <b>isotopes</b> of neodymium. Lighter unstable <b>isotopes</b> of samarium primarily decay by electron capture to <b>isotopes</b> of promethium, while heavier ones convert through beta decay to <b>isotopes</b> of europium.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the most}} stable <b>isotope</b> of fermium is 257Fm, with a {{half-life}} of 100.5days, most studies are conducted on 255Fm (t1/2= 20.07(7)hours), since this <b>isotope</b> can be easily isolated as required as the decay product of 255Es (t1/2= 39.8(12)days).|$|E
5|$|Commercially, the {{radioactive}} <b>isotope</b> bismuth-213 {{can be produced}} by bombarding radium with bremsstrahlung photons from a linear particle accelerator. In 1997, an antibody conjugate with bismuth-213, which has a 45-minute half-life and decays with the emission of an alpha particle, was used to treat patients with leukemia. This <b>isotope</b> has also been tried in cancer treatment, for example, in the targeted alpha therapy (TAT) program.|$|E
5|$|Francium {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{unstable}} of the naturally occurring elements: its longest-lived <b>isotope,</b> francium-223, has a half-life of only 22minutes. The only comparable element is astatine, whose most stable natural <b>isotope,</b> astatine-219 (the alpha daughter of francium-223), has a half-life of 56seconds, although synthetic astatine-210 is much longer-lived with a half-life of 8.1hours. All isotopes of francium decay into astatine, radium, or radon. Francium-223 also has a shorter half-life than the longest-lived <b>isotope</b> of each synthetic element up to and including element 105, dubnium.|$|E
50|$|Monazite geochronology {{studies the}} ratio of parent <b>isotopes</b> to {{daughter}} <b>isotopes</b> (isotopic ratio), and calculates how much time has passed since daughter <b>isotopes</b> start accumulating.|$|R
5|$|The primary {{decay mode}} for <b>isotopes</b> lighter than 153Eu is {{electron}} capture, {{and the primary}} mode for heavier <b>isotopes</b> is beta minus decay. The primary decay products before 153Eu are <b>isotopes</b> of samarium (Sm) and the primary products after are <b>isotopes</b> of gadolinium (Gd).|$|R
5|$|All other {{praseodymium}} <b>isotopes</b> have half-lives under a day (and most under a minute), {{with the}} single exception of 143Pr with a half-life of 13.6days. Both 143Pr and 141Pr occur as fission products of uranium. The primary decay mode of <b>isotopes</b> lighter than 141Pr is inverse beta decay or electron capture to <b>isotopes</b> of cerium, while that of heavier <b>isotopes</b> is beta decay to <b>isotopes</b> of neodymium.|$|R
5|$|Francium-223 is {{the most}} stable <b>isotope,</b> with a {{half-life}} of 21.8minutes, and {{it is highly unlikely}} that an <b>isotope</b> of francium with a longer half-life will ever be discovered or synthesized. Francium-223 is the fifth product of the actinium decay series as the daughter <b>isotope</b> of actinium-227. Francium-223 then decays into radium-223 by beta decay (1149keV decay energy), with a minor (0.006%) alpha decay path to astatine-219 (5.4MeV decay energy).|$|E
5|$|In 1961, Berkeley {{scientists}} {{claimed the}} discovery of element 103 in the reaction of californium with boron and carbon ions. They claimed {{the production of the}} <b>isotope</b> 257103, and also claimed to have synthesized an alpha decaying <b>isotope</b> of element 102 that had a half-life of 15s and alpha decay energy 8.2MeV. They assigned this to 255102 without giving a reason for the assignment. The values do not agree with those now known for 255No, although they do agree with those now known for 257No, and while this <b>isotope</b> probably played a part in this experiment its discovery was inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, Ghiorso et al. {{obtained}} the first <b>isotope</b> of lawrencium by irradiating californium (mostly californium-252) with boron-10 and boron-11 ions. The mass number of this <b>isotope</b> was not clearly established (possibly 258 or 259) at the time. In 1965, 256Lr was synthesized by Flyorov et al. from 243Am and 18O. Thus IUPAC recognized the nuclear physics teams at Dubna and Berkeley as the co-discoverers of lawrencium.|$|E
50|$|Magnesium (12Mg) {{naturally}} {{occurs in}} three stable <b>isotopes,</b> 24Mg, 25Mg, and 26Mg. There are 19 radioisotopes {{that have been}} discovered, ranging from 19Mg to 40Mg. The longest-lived radioisotope is 28Mg with a half-life of 20.915 hours. The lighter <b>isotopes</b> mostly decay to <b>isotopes</b> of sodium while the heavier <b>isotopes</b> decay to <b>isotopes</b> of aluminium. The shortest-lived is 19Mg with a half-life of 4 picoseconds.|$|R

All other radioactive cerium <b>isotopes</b> have half-lives under four days, {{and most of them}} have half-lives under ten minutes. The <b>isotopes</b> between 140Ce and 144Ce inclusive occur as fission products of uranium.

5|$|Isotopes {{of carbon}} are atomic nuclei that contain six protons plus {{a number of}} {{neutrons}} (varying from 2 to 16). Carbon has two stable, naturally occurring isotopes. The <b>isotope</b> carbon-12 (C) forms 98.93% of the carbon on Earth, while carbon-13 (C) forms the remaining 1.07%. The concentration of C is further increased in biological materials because biochemical reactions discriminate against C. In 1961, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) adopted the <b>isotope</b> carbon-12 {{as the basis for}} atomic weights. Identification of carbon in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments is done with the <b>isotope</b> C.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} {{realized}} that the beta decay of 239Np must produce an <b>isotope</b> of element 94 (now called plutonium), but the quantities involved in McMillan and Abelson's original experiment were too small to isolate and identify plutonium along with neptunium.
