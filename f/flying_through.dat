5|$|Air force experts raised {{questions}} and the Malaysian opposition leveled criticisms {{about the state of}} Malaysia's air force and radar capabilities.

The Malaysian military became aware of the unidentified aircraft only after reviewing radar recordings several hours after the flight's disappearance. The failure to recognise and react to the unidentified aircraft was a security breach, and was also a missed opportunity to intercept Flight 370 and prevent the time-consuming and expensive search operation.|$|E

It was included as a bonus feature in The Fantasia Anthology DVD in 2000.|$|E

The main objective {{of the game is}} to fly through rings while gathering enough keys to proceed to the next level. Development of Journey of Dreams began shortly after the release of Shadow the Hedgehog in 2005, and was headed by Sonic Team veteran Takashi Iizuka. The team took steps to ensure that the game stayed faithful to the original, while incorporating a variety of new mechanics and features. The game's setting was designed to resemble England, especially parts of London.|$|E
5|$|Cloud, a single-player {{video game}} for Microsoft Windows, {{centers on a}} boy who dreams of <b>flying</b> <b>through</b> the sky while asleep in a {{hospital}} bed. The player assumes control of the sleeping boy's avatar—the projection of the boy into his dream world—and guides him through his dream {{of a small group}} of islands with a light gathering of clouds. The avatar's direction and speed are controlled with a mouse; movement is generally on a horizontal plane, but vertical flight can be attained by holding down the third button of the mouse. The player may interact with clouds only while flying horizontally.|$|E
5|$|Exasperated, Candace {{returns to}} the circus, where Jeremy has saved a spot for her, only for the boys to mistake her for Buford and include her in his act. She is sent <b>flying</b> <b>through</b> {{the roof of the}} tent, just as Doofenshmirtz and Perry are flying overhead. Doofenshmirtz's machine activates, giving {{everyone}} in the cirque audience high-pitched voices that cause the tent to rupture. The high velocity of Doofenshmirtz's flying machine propels the tent up into the air, destroying the machine and sending Doofenshmirtz flying off (with a high voice). Jeremy gives a CD to Candace, but Candace is not at the house, but Candace then gets the CD from Jeremy.|$|E
