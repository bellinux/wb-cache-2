25|$|The mosque {{is named}} after its presumed founder, Manuchihr, {{the first member of}} the Shaddadid dynasty that ruled Ani after 1072. The oldest {{surviving}} part of the mosque is <b>its</b> <b>still</b> intact minaret. It has the Arabic word Bismillah ("In the name of God") in Kufic lettering high on its northern face. The prayer hall, half of which survives, dates from a later period (the 12th or 13th century). In 1906 the mosque was partially repaired in order for it to house a public museum containing objects found during Nicholas Marr's excavations.|$|E

It is the protected sanctuary where {{a wide spectrum of}} animal and plant species flourishes. They include crocodiles, chimpanzees, gorillas, various monkeys, leopards, elephants, antelopes, buffaloes. It is also a great place to observe different species of birds.|$|E

25|$|Though {{from this}} plant, {{collected}} by Endert {{on the last}} Borneo expedition, the pitchers are unknown, the other parts are so peculiar and differ from all other species in such a striking manner, that it seems allowed to me to base a new species on it. It was found on a steep mountain slope, covered with dense forest at 1800 m above sea level. It reminds {{one to the other}} species, discovered by Endert on the same mountain, viz. N. fusca, by its colour and its red-brown indumentum, but it differs by its quite other leaf shape and nervation, and <b>its</b> <b>still</b> denser indumentum.|$|E
25|$|As World War II {{approached}} {{its conclusion}} (effectively on 14 August but formally not until 2 September), training {{activities and the}} strength of Training Command declined. The end of the war in Europe in May caused the focus of training to shift from the needs of the European Theater to those of the Pacific, particularly courses associated with very heavy bombardment. Then, with the cessation of hostilities in the Pacific, most training ceased for those students not planning to remain in the post-war air forces. Before that time, however, the trend in training had gone increasingly toward specialized training on particular types of aircraft. Then during the last four months of 1945, rapid retrenchment in training occurred, and emphasis shifted to separating people from the Army Air Forces and reorganizing Training Command for <b>its</b> <b>still</b> undetermined peacetime goals.|$|E
25|$|After the Soviet victory, many Kuban cossacks {{fled the}} country to avoid {{persecution}} by the Bolsheviks. A notable eviction point was the Greek island of Lemnos where 18,000 Kuban Cossacks landed, many of whom died of starvation and disease. Soon after the Red Army's victory, the Kuban Cossack Host was officially dissolved. Because of their past loyalty to the Russian Emperor and the White Army, the new Soviet Government viewed all Cossacks {{as a threat to}} <b>its</b> <b>still</b> fragile power. An anti-Cossack campaign was implemented and the Kuban Cossack families would endure deliberate segregation as the Bolsheviks gave much of the Forecaucasus territory to the new autonomous provinces of local minorities, and encouraged the settlement of the pre-mountain steppes by the latter, sometimes forcefully evicting the Cossacks from their native homes. Collectivization of the fertile steppe also began. Most of the Cossacks became local peasants and worked in the new conditions. During the Soviet famine of 1932-1934, many Cossacks died of starvation.|$|E

2500|$|Although Susan Harris {{had planned}} for five seasons of Soap, {{the program was}} {{abruptly}} canceled by ABC after its fourth season. Therefore, the final one-hour episode, which originally aired on April 20, 1981, did not serve as a series finale and instead ended with several unresolved cliffhangers. These involve a suicidal Chester preparing to kill Danny and Annie (his son and wife) after catching them in bed together, an irreversibly hypnotized Jodie believing {{himself to be a}} 90-year-old Jewish man, Burt preparing to walk into an ambush orchestrated by his political enemies, and Jessica about to be executed by a Communist firing squad. Vlasic Foods pulled their sponsorship of the program shortly after this episode aired and ABC announced that the program was not picked up for its planned fifth season. The official reason given by the network was its declining ratings. However, according to the Museum of Broadcast Communications, Soap [...] "ended under suspicion that resistance from ad agencies may have caused ABC to cancel [...] at that point" [...] because <b>its</b> <b>still</b> controversial content was negatively affecting its relationship with sponsors.|$|E
2500|$|Though {{after the}} Peace of 1713 the Anglo-Dutch {{alliance}} of 1689 formally remained in place (with the Republic a guarantor of the Protestant Succession in Great Britain, which obliged it {{to send troops}} to England during the 1715 and 1745 invasions of the Jacobite Pretenders), in practice the Republic embarked on a policy of neutrality {{during most of the}} 18th century. This placed Dutch shipping in an enviable protected position during the many wars of that century (as long as the British Admiralty court was prepared to recognize the Dutch claim of [...] "free ship, free good"), enabling it to provide efficient shipping services with <b>its</b> <b>still</b> very large fleet to all European countries. But it eroded the power of the stapelmarkt, as did the emergence of competitors like London and the German North Sea ports Bremen and Hamburg. This weakening of the province of Holland as a trade hub in its turn contributed to a disarticulation of the Dutch economic sectors trade, industry, banking and insurance, that had been highly integrated in the Golden Age. Each of those sectors embarked on its own growth path in the 18th-century Dutch economy.|$|E
2500|$|... {{uses the}} device of the {{palimpsest}} {{to present a}} fictional tissue combining elements of both ancient and modern sources {{as well as the}} [...] "dialogue" [...] of its two protagonists. It is composed of a series of fragmented entries in a fictional diary recording the experiences of an unnamed protagonist during a train journey into an unknown land. The man has been released - or escaped - from some time of confinement elliptically described in his journal and reminiscent of a hospital, prison, ghetto or enclave of some sort. His subsequent wanderings among desolate landscapes on the verge of reality are set in a closely detailed, and somehow Kafkaesque, atmosphere, undercutting the point that the most dreamlike occurrences are also the realest. Along the way, the protagonist delves deeper in what seems like a quasi-religious quest while, at the same time, his growing impression of being stalked introduces an element of suspense and a film noir-like quality. Thus, the text hinges on the metaphysical but is also reminiscent of an L.A. private eye in a 1940s detective novel closing upon an extraordinary discovery. Z213: Exit ends with a description of a sacrifice where the protagonist and a [...] "hungry band feasting" [...] roast a lamb on a spit, cutting and skinning <b>its</b> <b>still</b> bleating body and removing its entrails as if observing a sacred rite.|$|E
