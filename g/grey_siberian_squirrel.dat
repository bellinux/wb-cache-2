40|$|Abstract: <b>Siberian</b> flying <b>squirrel,</b> an {{endangered}} species in South Korea, is distributed through major mountain regions of South Korea. The number of <b>Siberian</b> flying <b>squirrel</b> (Pteromys volans) in South Korea has decreased and their habitats are fragmented and isolated because of anthropogenic activities. So far no molecular genetic data has, however, been available for their conservation and management. To obtain better information concerning genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships of the <b>Siberian</b> flying <b>squirrel</b> in South Korea, we examined 14 individuals from South Korea, 7 individuals from Russia, and 5 individuals from northeastern China along with previously published 29 haplotypes for 1, 140 bp of the mtDNA cytochrome b gene. The 14 new individuals from South Korea had 7 haplotypes which were not observed in the regions of Russia and Hokkaido. The level of genetic diversity (0. 616 %...|$|R

He found them, as Luka had said, excellent eating, although it required three or four of them to furnish anything like a meal. He soon, however, gave over shooting, for he found that Luka was at least as certain with his bow as he was with the gun, with the advantage that the blunt arrow did not spoil the skins.

40|$|Abstract We {{analyzed}} {{the responses of}} small mammals to clear-cutting in temperate and boreal forests in Europe. We conducted a meta-analysis of published research on most often studied small mammal species (the striped field mouse, the yellow-necked mouse, the wood mouse, the field vole, the common vole, the bank vole, the Eurasian harvest mouse, the common shrew and the Eurasian pygmy shrew), comparing their abundance on clear-cuts and in unharvested stands. For four other species (the gray-sided vole, the <b>Siberian</b> flying <b>squirrel,</b> the Eurasian red squirrel and the hazel dormouse), we provide a qualitative review of their responses to forest harvest. Results of the meta-analysis suggest that common species of small mammals usually increase in abundance after clear-cutting or are unaffected by this disturbance. As an exception, the yel-low-necked mouse declines after clear-cutting in boreal but not in temperate forest. The qualitative review suggests that the responses of more specialized (e. g., arboreal) species to forest harvest are more varied than the responses of generalist species included in the meta-analysis. For some species of small mammals (e. g., the <b>Siberian</b> flying <b>squirrel),</b> habitat loss resulting from forest harvest is a major threat...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Spatial {{structure}} of habitats {{has been found}} to affect the species abundance and distribution patterns in heterogeneous environments. In this thesis, I studied landscape responses of the <b>Siberian</b> flying <b>squirrel</b> in a boreal forest context in northern Finland. Studies were conducted at several spatial scales in order to identify landscape characteristics that are associated with the species occurrence at a local scale and its distribution patterns at a regional scale. Data on species presence and absence in forest areas were collected in the field. Habitat patterns in landscapes were analysed from satellite images and landscape metrics concerning landscape structure were quantified in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Results of this study are in agreement with the general landscape ecological theory and findings in the field. In northern Finland, the distribution of the <b>Siberian</b> flying <b>squirrel</b> primarily follows the spatial extent of spruce-dominated forests but that its actual occurrence is dependent on the scale of observation and the habitat structure. At a home range scale the abundance of deciduous trees in old spruce forest increases the probability that a forest site is occupied by the species, whereas at a local scale the amount of such spruce forests and linkages between habitat patches play an important role. At a regional scale, an increase in open areas and the dominance of pine makes the habitat unsuitable and restricts the presence of the species. Findings of the present research forward practical forest management planning at a large scale and may help set general conservation goals for the <b>Siberian</b> flying <b>squirrel.</b> When managing the species in a complex network of habitat patches in heterogeneous landscapes, spatial dispersion of potential habitat patches as well as connecting habitat and their temporal development should be considered carefully. For this purpose, remote sensed images and GIS are valuable and useful tools. Satellite-image based landscape analysis is presently developing rapidly and hopefully this methodology will soon become a common practice in landscape ecological research and everyday forest management planning...|$|R
40|$|Populations of the <b>Siberian</b> flying <b>squirrel</b> Pteromys volans {{are declining}} {{as a result}} of {{insensitive}} forestry that has removed cavity trees. To conserve the cavities preferred by squirrels, we investigated the characteristics of the cavities they used as nests. We located 100 cavities with > 3. 0 cm entrance size (which they are able to enter), and investigated their use by the squirrels. We also recorded the entrance heights and entrance sizes of the cavities and the health and heights of cavity trees. The squirrels used 29 of 100 cavities. Entrance size and tree health strongly influenced cavity use, and entrance height had a weaker influence. Tree height was not correlated with cavity use. Squirrels preferred higher cavities with smaller entrances and on live trees. The entrance size of the cavities used was limited to ≤ 5. 0 cm. Squirrels used 38 % of live trees but only 14 % of dead trees. In addition, the squirrels avoided cavities at low heights. They never used cavities 1. 0 m height and with entrance sizes of 3. 0 to ≤ 5. 0 cm on live trees were preferred. We suggest that cavities with these characteristics should be conserved to protect the habitats of <b>Siberian</b> flying <b>squirrels.</b> Download the complete issue...|$|R
40|$|To {{maintain}} local {{populations of}} the <b>Siberian</b> flying <b>squirrel</b> Pteromys volans in restricted small habitats, {{it is necessary to}} understand their nesting and food biology. Communal nesting of P. volans is well documented in the Eurasian continent, but the details of this behavior have been poorly investigated in Japan. We investigated a group composition of P. volans in Hokkaido, Japan. The mean numbers of individuals using each nest box and tree cavity were 2. 17 and 2. 44, respectively. Although each female had its own exclusive home range, communal nesting composed by two females was observed in nest boxes. This result suggested that females frequently used nest boxes and formed same-sex groups in urban areas where nest resources might be scarce. Communal nesting of P. volans was found in both nest boxes and cavities with seasonal difference, and cavities were mainly used in winter. Communal nesting of P. volans in Japan may be associated with reproduction, because most cases of communal nesting were composed of one male and one female. To conserve local population of the <b>Siberian</b> flying <b>squirrel,</b> the preservation of cavities, which are usable for more than two individuals, is needed to enable them to breed stably and overwinter safely...|$|R

A distinctive feature of flying squirrels is the furry glide membrane or patagium, a flap of skin that stretches between {{the front and rear}} legs. By spreading this membrane the flying squirrel may glide from tree to tree across distances of over a hundred metres, and have been known to record a glide ratio of 3.31, but is normally 1-1.5.|$|R
40|$|How an {{individual}} selects resources of varying quality {{is essential for}} its future fitness. Decision rules that animals use to select novel items have long been studied {{in the context of}} mate and resource choice. We use this framework to study search phase of natal dispersal in the <b>Siberian</b> flying <b>squirrel</b> (Pteromys volans L.). This study gives further evidence for recent suggestion that the decision-rule framework is applicable to studies of information gathering during dispersal. We found that dispersing flying squirrels frequently revisited prospected sites, supporting comparative Bayes decision rule. However, this was the case during short-distanced dispersal, whereas long-distance dispersers used more sequential search. We suggest that although the dispersers might use comparative decision rules during short-distance prospecting around one location, it may not be advantageous to revisit previously found sites while performing long-distance movements.

40|$|Neurogenesis {{occurs in}} the adult {{mammalian}} hippocampus, a region of the brain important for learning and memory. Hibernation in <b>Siberian</b> ground <b>squirrels</b> provides a natural model to study mitosis as the rapid fall in body temperature in 24 [*]h (from 35 - 36 °C to + 4 – 6 °C) permits accumulation of mitotic cells {{at different stages of}} the cell cycle. Histological methods used to study adult neurogenesis are limited largely to fixed tissue, and the mitotic state elucidated depends on the specific phase of mitosis at the time of day. However, using an immunohistochemical study of doublecortin (DCX) and BrdU-labelled neurons, we demonstrate that the dentate gyrus of the ground squirrel hippocampus contains a population of immature cells which appear to possess mitotic activity. Our data suggest that doublecortin-labelled immature cells exist in a mitotic state and may represent a renewable pool for generation of new neurons within the dentate gyrus...|$|R
40|$|Theoretically, {{dispersers}} should {{target the}} habitat where prospects for fitness will be highest.
