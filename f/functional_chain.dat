40|$|Polymers {{bearing the}} dibromomaleimide (DBM) {{group as a}} <b>functional</b> <b>chain</b> end have been {{synthesized}} by RAFT polymerization. A DBM <b>functional</b> <b>chain</b> transfer agent (CTA) was utilized to afford well-defined PtBA, PMA, and PTEGA, without the requirement of protecting group chemistry. It was found that RAFT polymerization of NIPAM and styrene with this CTA was severely retarded/inhibited which is ascribed to their relatively low propagation rate constants compared to acrylates. This observation is accounted for by a reversible trapping of propagating radicals by the DBM group in RAFT polymerizations using a monomer with low kp. However, further attempts to synthesize DBM-terminated PtBA and PMA by ATRP using an analogous initiator were unsuccessful, and broad PDI were observed. Furthermore, highly efficient postpolymerization functionalization of DBM-terminated PMA produced by RAFT, with the model compound thiophenol was also demonstrated...|$|E

Because of their critical nature, such systems have to meet strict timing properties. To help the designers to prove the correctness of their system, the real-time systems community has developed numerous approaches for analysing the worst case scenarios either on the processors (e. g., worst case response time of a task) or on the networks (e. g., worst case traversal time of a message). These approaches provide results only for local components behaviours. However, there is a growing need for having a global view of the system, in order to determine end-to-end properties.

Each resin sample was light cured and immersed in the culture medium for 24 hours to make the extract solution. Then, human gingival fibroblasts were cultured in different extract solutions for 72 hours. The cytotoxicities of different resins were evaluated by microtitertetrazolium (MTT) assay, the levels of cell-produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by different extract solutions was measured. ResultsResins of the T 1 / 4 and B groups revealed significantly higher cytotoxicity than resins of other groups. However, resins of the T 1 and T 3 / 2 groups exhibited less cytotoxicity. In general, resins of the TDI-modified groups showed equal or less cytotoxicity and induced equal or lower levels of ROS than the corresponding resins of the HDI-modified and B groups. ConclusionOur {{results showed that the}} TDI-modified resin matrices containing more <b>functional</b> side <b>chains</b> were less cytotoxic than the corresponding HDI-modified resin matrices. When the ratio of <b>functional</b> side <b>chain</b> to bis-GMA is increased, the stereo hindrance of resin structure is increased, more toxic resin monomers are trapped in the complicated resin structure, and thus the resin matrix reveals less cytotoxicity.
