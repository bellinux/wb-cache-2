5|$|Though little {{specific}} data are available, the Japanese sleeper ray {{is believed to}} be caught incidentally in shrimp trawls and other <b>demersal</b> <b>fishing</b> gear throughout its range. It is not utilized economically; however, electric rays tend not to survive being caught and discarded, and shrimp trawling is known to have caused marked population declines in other electric ray species elsewhere. Given the high intensity of fishing activity off East Asia, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|The finless sleeper ray is {{susceptible}} to bottom trawls and perhaps other <b>demersal</b> <b>fishing</b> gear. It is a potential bycatch of fisheries operating throughout its range, which are particularly intense in the Andaman Sea. Most individuals caught are probably discarded, though post-capture survival rates {{are believed to be}} extremely low. Additionally, catches of this species by Burmese fishers are often sold in Phuket in Thailand. Due to heavy fishing pressure within its range and its low reproductive rate, the finless sleeper ray has been assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Specific population data are lacking, but at least off Thailand electric ray populations overall appear to have declined since 1975.|$|E
5|$|The {{electric}} {{shock of the}} common torpedo can be severe, but is not life-threatening. In classical antiquity, the electrogenic properties of this species led it (and other strongly electric fishes) {{to be used in}} medicine for the treatment of pain and diseases such as gout. For example, the Roman physician Scribonius Largus, in his Compositiones medicae (c. 50 AD), recommended that chronic headaches be treated by the application of a live torpedo to the affected area. The common torpedo is edible, but is little-valued by commercial or artisanal fisheries and is mostly discarded when caught. Because of its shallow-water habits, it may survive being captured and discarded relatively well. It is susceptible to several types of <b>demersal</b> <b>fishing</b> gear, including bottom trawls and trammel nets; fishing activity is heavy within its range but no specific data regarding this species are available. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Data Deficient. The common torpedo has been kept in aquariums, but requires live fish for food.|$|E
25|$|Deep sea <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> {{are usually}} long and narrow. Many are eels or shaped like eels. This {{may be because}} long bodies have long lateral lines. Lateral lines detect low-frequency sounds, and some <b>demersal</b> <b>fishes</b> have muscles that drum such sounds to attract mates. Smell is also important, as {{indicated}} by the rapidity with which <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> find traps baited with bait fish.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{makes use of}} the {{fisheries}} survey data collected during the period 1984 - 87 by the multi-purpose research vessel RV Anusandhani {{in the waters of}} Bangladesh, Bay of Bengal. The data consists of twelve survey cruises directed at the shrimp resources (1985 - 87) and nineteen survey cruises directed at the <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> resources (1984 - 86). The biomasses for shrimp and <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> during the survey period were estimated, along with a detailed analysis of biomass distribution by depth zone and catch rates for important species of shrimp and <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> species. The <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> and shrimp biomass during the survey period was estimated as 176 160 t and 857 t, respectively. The levels of biomass when compared with 1973 estimates indicate a tremendous decline, by about 90 % for shrimps and 30 % for <b>demersal</b> <b>fish.</b> Population parameters for four species of shrimps (for both males and females) as well as for eight <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> species were also estimated. The parameter estimates were validated using available growth and mortality parameter values from the literature, and were in turn used to estimate the mean exploitation rate (E) of <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> and shrimp species comprising the trawl catch. Mean E values for shrimp species is at 0. 61 and 0. 57 for <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> species, indicating over-exploitation of demersal resources in the Bay of Bengal. Exploratory analysis using surplus production modeling of catch and effort data shows that the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) level for shrimp resources is around 3 500 t, corresponding to a maximum effort level of approximately 6 480 fishing days. Similar analysis for <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> catches gave poor correlations between catch rates and fishing effort.

5000|$|Like most seamounts, they attract fish. Over 175 {{species have}} been found there, {{including}} splendid alfonsino, black cardinal fish, black scabbardfish, and wreckfish.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is the first to}} investigate deepwater <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> distribution and community structure around South Georgia and Shag Rocks. Analysis of catch data from a trawl survey conducted in 2003 indicated that depth and location have a marked influence over <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> community structure in the region. Three distinct, depth-stratified fish assemblages were observed. The <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> assemblage found on the shelf to depths of around 400 m was dominated by nototheniids and was comprised largely of species endemic to the Southern Ocean and Scotia Sea. At the greatest depths sampled (> 600 m) the <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> community was dominated by gadiform fishes including members of the Macrouridae and Moridae, many of which are not endemic to the Southern Ocean. From 400 to 600 m there was a transitional zone with <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> representatives of both the shelf and deeper slope communities.

40|$|Maerl {{beds are}} mixed sediments {{built by a}} surface layer of slow-growing, unattached coralline algae that are of {{international}} conservation significance because they create areas of high biodiversity. They are patchily distributed throughout Europe (to ‚àº 30 m depth around the British Isles and to ‚àº 120 m depth in the Mediterranean) and many are affected by towed <b>demersal</b> <b>fishing.</b> We report the effects of Newhaven scallop dredges on a previously unfished maerl bed compared with the effects on similar grounds that have been fished commercially in the Clyde Sea area, Scotland. Sediment cores were taken to assess the population density of live maerl thalli prior to scallop dredging on marked test and control plots. These plots were then monitored biannually over a four-year period. Live maerl thalli were sparsely distributed at the impacted site, and experimental dredging had no discernible effect on their numbers. The previously unfished ground had dense populations of live maerl and scallops (both Aequipecten opercularis and Pecten maximus).

40|$|This study loolcs at <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> {{food web}} {{interactions}} {{present at the}} Rockall Trough. Rockall Trough lies within Ices division V. This area is highly exploited {{by a number of}} mixed deep-water fisheries. Despite this there has been a lag in management of the area and an overall lack of knowledge of food web interactions. From examining previous literature and carrying out stable isotope analysis on a number of species, it became clear that there is a strong link between the <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> population and surface production. Pervious studies have suggested there to be two main sources of food to the <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> fauna. The first is via the exploitation of pelagic species on the slops exploitation of mesopelagic and benthopelagic prey species that overlap in depth range, or/and that carry out vertical /horizontal migrations. Carcase falls also fall within this first source of food to the deep-sea as they are a direct link to the surface. The second source of food is that of endemic benthic prey species, which appears to be less prominent in the fishes diet. A large number of <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> are seen to feed on a combination of these sources of food. Stable isotope analysis, appear to confirm the strong link between surface production and <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> as many fish are found with low SN 15 levels normally associated with feeding on pelagic species. The removal of commercial mesopelagic species found to be important prey species to the <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> fauna, can have serious implications to the demersal food web and ultimately the management of deep-sea stocks.
