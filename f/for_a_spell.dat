5|$|In 1903, Rhodes scored over 1,000 runs in {{the season}} for the first time, in the process {{completing}} his first double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets. However, after bowling {{a large number of}} overs against Worcestershire early in the season, he had little success as a bowler <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>spell</b> of three weeks. Pelham Warner, a leading amateur cricketer and later captain of England, noted that Rhodes was comparatively unsuccessful {{at the start of the}} year but came back well to take 193 wickets. Warner wrote that Rhodes at this time was accused of being easy to face on a wicket which suited the batsmen, although Warner himself did not agree.|$|E
5|$|To-Me Ku-Pa (a name phonetically {{similar to}} that of British comedian Tommy Cooper) is an evil necromancer who {{regularly}} crosses paths with Thrud and is depicted as a bald man wearing a large cloak. Thrud first encounters To-Me Ku-Pa in an early White Dwarf strip and is turned into a frog. Subsequently, in The Three Tasks of Thrud, To-Me Ku-Pa takes advantage of Thrud's drugged state, following Lymara's failed assassination attempt, to hypnotise him and force him to obtain three items necessary <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>spell.</b>|$|E

Sunline led, and her jockey, Greg Childs, explained that she travelled well to the home turn, but, in an echo of the autumn's Queen Elizabeth Stakes, tired badly in the home straight and finished seventh. She then returned home to New Zealand <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>spell.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Germans {{launched}} their last great offensive in December, {{resulting in the}} Battle of the Bulge. In an attempt to repeat their 1940 success, German forces were launched through the Ardennes. Again they encountered weak forces holding the front, as the American formations there were either new to the war or exhausted units on a quiet sector of the front rehabilitating. There were however also some important differences to 1940 {{which resulted in the}} German offensive ultimately failing. They were facing enormously strong Allied airpower unlike in 1940 when they had ruled the skies. The opening of the offensive was timed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>spell</b> of bad weather, aimed at removing the threat of the Allied airpower, but the weather cleared again relatively soon.|$|E
25|$|Hyde United {{formed in}} 1919 after {{demands for a}} {{football}} club to be re-established. United {{was added to the}} name because of a match between two groups which used to meet in the market place: the Forty Gang and the Discharged Soldiers and Sailors, both of which groups were very active in the resurrection of the club. After one season in the Lancashire and Cheshire Federation, Hyde joined the Manchester League and by 1930 had won it five times and won the Gilgryst Cup twice. In the 1920s, players wore black-and-white halved shirts <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>spell.</b> The club moved into the Cheshire County League in 1930 and won the League Challenge Cup four years later. The decade after the Second World War proved to be a purple patch for the club. In 1946, they won the Cheshire Senior Cup, the first of many trophies to arrive at Ewen Fields during the next ten years. In 1953, Hyde won the League Cup followed by a league and cup double a season later. The 1955–56 season saw the club retain the championship and finish as runners-up in the following three seasons.|$|E

25|$|Kallis {{attended}} {{and played}} cricket for Wynberg Boys' High School. In 2009 Wynberg honoured Kallis by naming their main cricket oval after him. As a teenager, Kallis {{had a brief}} spell with Netherfield CC in England where he established himself in Northern England – Kallis was only 19 when he spent a summer at Parkside Road back in 1995, returning 791 runs {{at an average of}} 98.87 from 14 matches before making his Test debut against England later that year. Kallis also played for Old Edwardians <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>spell</b> as a teenager, where coaching staff saw potential for him to become a first-class all rounder; in July 1993 he was picked for South Africa U-17's against Scotland's U-19 team. He made his first-class debut in 1993/94 as an 18-year-old, playing for Western Province B. His first Test appearance was on 14–18 December 1995 against England in Durban, but he struggled with the bat in his first few matches. Kallis made his World Cup bow in 1996 in Pakistan but did not have much opportunity to excel. His breakthrough came in 1997 with 61 against Pakistan, but more notably two matches later when he salvaged a draw for South Africa with a fighting century against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.|$|E
25|$|As {{the teams}} {{returned}} up the pavilion steps Sir Donald Bradman called Richie Benaud {{to one side}} and reminded him that England's only chance of retaining the Ashes was it they were forced to follow on and made a lot of runs. Benaud agreed with him, but excused himself as he had to go and tell Peter May {{that he was going to}} bat again. When he reached the dressing room he consoled May with what Sir Donald had said. This was repeated by cricket commentators when a Test side in this situation must win, notably when Allan Border's Australians followed on at The Oval in 1985. Watson (40) returned with Richardson (43) and together they saw off the new ball to end the day on 43/0, and produced the highest England opening stand of the series, staying for almost three hours and adding 89. Davidson could not bowl after his injury, Rorke opened the bowling with Lindwall and Benaud had to bowl himself <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>spell</b> of four hours. The partnership ended when Watson pulled a full toss from the captain and Les Favell ran in to take the catch on the boundary. Richardson fell to Benaud (4/84) padding up against a ball that didn't move having survived a l.b.w. appeal the ball before. May (59) and Graveney looked set for big scores, and the England captain struck Benaud for three successive fours before he was leg before by a torpedo from Rorke (2/78). Bailey was caught by Grout off Lindwall (2/70) on the last ball of the day, though he and Graveney thought the ball had come off the top of his pad. At 198/5 England's cause looked lost and Graveney could only look on as the lower order collapsed before him. Lock (9) stayed in for an hour as did Tyson, who made 33 in a stand of 46, but the other three tailenders only lasted 20 minutes and Graveney ended with 53 not out, having batted for over five hours. England's total of 270 put them only 34 runs ahead.|$|E

500|$|Final Destination films, for {{the film}} and media studies scholar Eugenie Brinkema, are {{characterized}} by their {{move away from the}} typical horror antagonist and towards the certainty and inevitability of death. This makes the films inconsistent with many analyses of horror, according to which horror films require a monster. Final Destination films depart from other horror films, and even other horror films aimed at teens, in that they feature [...] "no families, no repression; no psychic, geographic, or domestic hauntings; and no sexuality—neither the pursuit of pleasure in the slasher convention of easy bodily access nor the monstrosity of sexual difference". The films, Brinkema argues, are not about the seeking of pleasure, as are paradigmatic slashers, but are instead about the avoidance of pain and death; they are [...] "constitutively bitter, anhedonic, paranoid, and sad". In the films, death becomes its own cause; the premonition of the roller-coaster derailment in Final Destination 3 is without context or cause, but the fact that some characters are able to avoid the death they would have had grounds the necessity of their deaths, in the order that they would have died on the roller coaster. Thus, [...] "Death's list" [...] or [...] "Death's design" [...] is realized. Final Destination 3 spends as much time interpreting deaths as displaying them. Wendy's close analysis of photographs allows her to come to understand the deaths, but is inevitably too late. In the franchise's films, Brinkema says, [...] "one must closely read to survive (<b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>spell),</b> and yet reading changes absolutely nothing at all". Thus, the characters [...] "might as well" [...] have stayed on the roller coaster.|$|E

2500|$|Derry {{have worn}} {{red and white}} stripes since, except from 1956 to 1962, when the club's players wore amber and black. Jerseys since 1962 have had [...] "candystripes" [...] of varying thickness. The kit {{features}} white socks – originally black socks were used and occasionally red if a clash with the opposition occurred. Similarly, white shorts were adopted <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>spell</b> in the early 1970s and for 1985. They are still sometimes worn if a clash occurs, as are black socks. Away jerseys have varied in colour from white, to navy and green stripes, to yellow, to white and light-blue stripes, and to black.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{one other}} way <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>spell</b> to be [...] "countered". If the spell targets {{something}} (such as Giant Growth or Shock), then the target must be legal both when the spell is cast and when it resolves. A spell can't be cast without a legal target; if the target becomes illegal while the spell is on the stack, then the spell is countered by the game rules (for having an illegal target) just before it would start to resolve. If a spell is countered this way, then {{no part of the}} spell— even a non-targeting part of the spell's effect— takes place. This is referred to as 'Countered Upon Resolution' (formerly [...] "Fizzling").|$|E
2500|$|Davie {{left the}} club in October 1968, leaving McAlpine as second choice. Following an injury to Mackay, he made his {{competitive}} debut for Dundee United on 8 March 1969, in a 1–0 defeat against Heart of Midlothian at Tynecastle. That proved to be his only appearance that season, and he missed most of the following season following an operation for ligament damage. In October 1970, McAlpine came on {{as a substitute for}} the injured Mackay in a Fairs Cup tie against Sparta Prague to make his European debut and only his second competitive appearance overall. That proved to be a breakthrough for McAlpine, who went to make thirty appearances in all competitions that season and establish himself as first choice. Mackay was allowed to leave {{the club in}} 1972 by new manager Jim McLean, who brought back Davie as competition. McAlpine was still in the team until knee surgery ruled him out <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>spell</b> in 1974, which meant Davie played in United's first Scottish Cup final appearance.|$|E
