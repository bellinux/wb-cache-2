5|$|Soil {{nutrient}} deficiencies {{can cause}} a variety of plant problems that range from malformed plants {{to a lack of}} head growth. Many insects are attracted to lettuce, including cutworms, which cut seedlings off at the soil line; wireworms and nematodes, which cause yellow, stunted plants; tarnished plant bugs and aphids, which cause yellow, distorted leaves; leafhoppers, which cause stunted growth and pale leaves; thrips, which turn leaves gray-green or silver; leafminers, which create tunnels within the leaves; flea beetles, which cut small holes in leaves and caterpillars, slugs and snails, which cut large holes in leaves. Mammals, including rabbits and groundhogs, also eat the plants. Lettuce contains several defensive compounds, including sesquiterpene lactones, and other natural phenolics such as <b>flavonol</b> and glycosides, which help to protect it against pests. Certain varieties contain more than others, and some selective breeding and genetic modification studies have focused on using this trait to identify and produce commercial varieties with increased pest resistance.|$|E
25|$|In red grapes, {{the main}} <b>flavonol</b> is on average quercetin, {{followed}} by myricetin, kaempferol, laricitrin, isorhamnetin, and syringetin. In white grapes, the main <b>flavonol</b> is quercetin, followed by kaempferol and isorhamnetin. The delphinidin-like flavonols myricetin, laricitrin, and syringetin are missing in all white varieties, {{indicating that the}} enzyme flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase is not expressed in white grape varieties.|$|E

40|$|Specific {{regularity}} in <b>flavonols</b> accumulation was observed. Maximum content offlavonols in leafs {{and flowers}} and minimum in stems was described. It was noticed that cultivars with bright colour (Anthocyanovaya and other) are accumulating more <b>flavonols</b> in leafs, than in flowers, but cultivars with less intensive colouration (Salatnaya, Gorets, Neotonitcheskaya) content more <b>flavonols</b> in flowers than in leafs. <b>Flavonols</b> concentrations {{go down to}} initial level and more bottoms are to end of vegetation...|$|R
40|$|Wild {{marigold}} (Tagetes minuta), a {{flowering plant}} {{of the family}} Asteraceae contains compounds of pharmaceutical and nutritional importance especially essential oils and <b>flavonols.</b> Identification, characterization of <b>flavonols</b> and determination of their antibacterial activity were major objectives of the current study. The isolation and purification of <b>flavonols</b> was accomplished using chromatographic techniques while structural elucidation was completed by LC-MS and NMR spectroscopy. The extracts and purified compounds were tested against various bacterial strains for antibacterial activity. A total of nineteen <b>flavonols</b> were isolated from this species. Of these, seventeen were of butanol and two of ethyl acetate extracts. Based on the concentration and purity, eight potential <b>flavonols</b> were selected and structurally elucidated. Four <b>flavonols,</b> 6 -hydroxyquercetin 7 -O-β-(6 ''-galloylglucopyranoside) (2), 6 -hydroxykaempferol 7 -O-β-glucopyranoside (5), 6 -hydroxykaempferol 7 -O-β-(6 ''-galloylglucopyranoside) (7), 6 -hydroxyquercetin 7 -O-β-(6 ''-caffeoylglucopyranoside) (9), were identified {{for the first time}} from T. minuta. Butanol and ethyl acetate extracts of flowers and seeds showed significant antibacterial activity against Micrococcus leteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas piket. Among the isolated <b>flavonols</b> only 1, 2 and 18 were found to possess significant antibacterial activity against M. luteus. The extracts and purified <b>flavonols</b> from T. minuta can be potential candidates for antibacterial drug discovery and support to ethnopharmacological use...|$|R
25|$|Within the {{flavonoid}} {{category is}} a subcategory known as <b>flavonols,</b> {{which includes the}} yellow pigment - quercetin. Like other flavonoids, the concentration of <b>flavonols</b> in the grape berries increases as {{they are exposed to}} sunlight. Some viticulturalists will use measurement of <b>flavonols</b> such as quercetin as an indication of a vineyard's sun exposure and the effectiveness of canopy management techniques.|$|R
25|$|Maclura pomifera {{contains}} an agglutinin, a lectin, {{that is highly}} specific toward the T-antigen. Osajin and pomiferin are flavonoid pigments present in the wood and fruit, comprising about 10% of the fruit's dry weight. The plant also contains the <b>flavonol</b> morin.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, the {{addition}} of fungal exudates alone partially mimicked {{the effect of the}} mantle in terms of root proliferation, root hair development and dichotomous branching. Some of these exudates act synergistically upon hyphal morphology, as with rutin (a <b>flavonol)</b> and zeatin (a cytokinin). However, some other metabolites act antagonistically, demonstrated by root development stemming from the release of hypaphorine and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). IAA must be tightly regulated in ectomycorrhizal symbioses due to its ability to inhibit root development above certain concentrations.|$|E

40|$|Glucuronidation {{is often}} {{recognized}} as one of the rate-determining factors that limit the bioavailability of <b>flavonols.</b> Hence, design and synthesis of more bioavailable <b>flavonols</b> would benefit from the establishment of predictive models of glucuronidation using kinetic parameters [e. g., Km, Vmax, intrinsic clearance (CLint) = Vmax/Km] derived for <b>flavonols.</b> This article aims to construct position (3 -OH) -specific comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) models to describe UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1 A 9 -mediated glucuronidation of <b>flavonols,</b> which can be used to design poor UGT 1 A 9 substrates. The kinetics of recombinant UGT 1 A 9 -mediated 3 -O-glucuronidation of 30 <b>flavonols</b> was characterized, and kinetic parameters (Km, Vmax, CLint) were obtained. The observed Km, Vmax, and CLint values of 3 -O-glucuronidation ranged from 0. 04 to 0. 68 μM, 0. 04 to 12. 95 nmol/mg/min, and 0. 06 to 109. 60 ml/mg/min, respectively. To model UGT 1 A 9 -mediated glucuronidation, 30 <b>flavonols</b> were split into the training (23 compounds) and test (7 compounds) sets. These <b>flavonols</b> were then aligned by mapping the <b>flavonols</b> to specific common feature pharmacophores, which were used to construct CoMFA models of Vmax and CLint, respectively. The derived CoMFA models possessed good internal and external consistency and showed statistical significance and substantive predictive abilities (Vmax model: q 2 = 0. 738, r 2 = 0. 976, rpred 2 = 0. 735; CLint model: q 2 = 0. 561, r 2 = 0. 938, rpred 2 = 0. 630). The contour maps derived from CoMFA modeling clearly indicate structural characteristics associated with rapid or slow 3 -O-glucuronidation. In conclusion, the approach of coupling CoMFA analysis with a pharmacophore-based structural alignment is viable for constructing a predictive model for regiospecific glucuronidation rates of <b>flavonols</b> by UGT 1 A 9...|$|R
50|$|<b>Flavonols</b> {{are present}} {{in a wide variety}} of fruits and vegetables. In Western populations, {{estimated}} daily intake is in the range of 20-50 mg per day for <b>flavonols.</b> Individual intake varies depending on the type of diet consumed.|$|R
40|$|As <b>flavonols</b> {{are present}} in fruits and vegetables, they are {{consumed}} in considerable amounts in the diet. There is growing evidence that the well-recognized antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and vasorelaxant actions of <b>flavonols</b> may, at least in part, result from modulation of biochemical signaling pathways and kinases. It is well established that diabetes is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite clinical management of blood glucose levels, diabetes often results in cardiovascular disease. There is good evidence that endothelial dysfunction contributes significantly to the progression of diabetic cardiovascular diseases. This review describes the biological actions of <b>flavonols</b> that may ameliorate adverse cardiovascular events in diabetes. We discuss evidence that <b>flavonols</b> may be developed as novel pharmacological agents to prevent diabetes-induced vascular dysfunction...|$|R

40|$|Red wine is {{a source}} of polyphenolic antioxidants, of which <b>flavonols</b> such as {{quercetin}} are representatives. Red wine might therefore prevent LDL oxidation and atherosclerosis. However, data on the bioavailability of <b>flavonols</b> from wine are lacking. Therefore, we compared the bioavailability of <b>flavonols,</b> especially quercetin, from red wine with that from the major dietary sources, yellow onions and black tea. Twelve healthy men consumed 750 mL red wine, 50 g fried onions or 375 mL of black tea, each for 4 d in random order. These supplements provided similar amounts of quercetin (14 - 16 mg). There was a washout period of 3 d between each period of supplementation. The plasma quercetin concentration after the consumption of wine was lower than that after onions (P < 0. 05) and not different from that after tea. Urinary excretion of quercetin after wine did not differ from that after onions and was higher than that after tea (P < 0. 05). We conclude that <b>flavonols</b> from red wine are absorbed. However, because one glass of red wine provides fewer available <b>flavonols</b> than one portion of onions or one glass of tea, red wine appears to be a poorer source of <b>flavonols</b> than these other two sources...|$|R

Total phenolic content {{was determined by the}} Folin-Ciocalteu method. The content of proanthocyanidins in acid-hydrolysed extracts was determined spectrophotometrically. The contents of free flavones (apigenin andluteolin) and <b>flavonols</b> (kaempferol, myricetin and quercetin) were determined by HPLC analysis. The time of hydrolysis of flavones, <b>flavonols</b> andproanthocyanidins was optimised. Antioxidant activities of apigenin, luteolin, kaempferol, myricetin, quercetin and of plant extracts were examined. Antioxidative activities were studied in sunflower oil at 98 °C, by measuring peroxide value, and in an aqueous emulsion system of -carotene and linoleic acid by measuring the absorbance of the sample. Among flavones and <b>flavonols</b> investigated, only myricetin inhibited oxidation of sunflower oil. All other flavones and <b>flavonols</b> showed pro-oxidative activity.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of different growth conditions on anthocyanins and <b>flavonols</b> accumulation in leaves of green and red loose leaf lettuce (Lactuca sativa var. crispa). Lettuce plants were grown in three types of conditions, in greenhouse (I. variant), behind clear glass in field (II. variant) and in open field conditions (III. variant). Estimation of anthocyanins and <b>flavonols</b> content was done by non-destructive measurements with optical fluorescence sensor Multiplex® 3 (Force-A, France). It was estimated that green lettuce varieties had a greater <b>flavonols</b> content compared to red lettuce varieties in all experimental variants. The highest level of <b>flavonols</b> was detected in leaves of green variety Zoltán (1. 218 RU) and in red lettuce had the highest amount of <b>flavonols</b> in variety Carmesi (1. 095 RU). At the same time red lettuce varieties were characterized by higher anthocyanins content. Parameter anthocyanin index is correlated with visible red coloration of leaves. The highest content of anthocyanins was detected in variety Oakly (0. 867 RU). Under the open field conditions was found statistically significant higher (P < 0. 05) <b>flavonols</b> and anthocyanins level in both green and red lettuce leaves compared to greenhouse conditions.
