5|$|Adjuvant {{chemotherapy}} {{refers to}} the use of chemotherapy after apparently curative surgery to improve the outcome. In NSCLC, samples are taken of nearby lymph nodes during surgery to assist staging. If stage II or III disease is confirmed, adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival by 5% at five years. The combination of vinorelbine and cisplatin <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> older regimens. Adjuvant chemotherapy for people with stage IB cancer is controversial, as clinical trials have not clearly demonstrated a survival benefit. Chemotherapy before surgery in NSCLC that can be removed surgically also appears to improve outcomes.|$|E

40|$|The {{way that}} {{multinational}} businesses in integrated global industries coordinate and control R&D, manufacturing, and marketing functions across borders has significant implications for performance. We propose that, in such global industries, certain integrating modes will <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> others in integrating a function globally. We show that each function {{has a different}} combination of effective integrating modes. For global R&D integration, people-based and information-based modes <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> formalization-based and centralization-based modes. For manufacturing, people, information, and formalization <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> centralization. With respect to marketing, information and centralization <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> people and formalization. We also demonstrate that the co-alignment between actual and ideal profiles (configurations or patterns) of integrating modes results in superior performance. Our results reveal that people-based and information-based modes <b>are</b> generally <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> formalization-based and centralization-based modes in coordinating and controlling business functions worldwide.

5|$|Censors like Martin Quigley and Joseph Breen {{understood}} that:a {{private industry}} code, strictly enforced, <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> government censorship {{as a means}} of imposing religious dogma. It is secret, for one thing, operating at the pre-production stage. The audience never knows what has been trimmed, cut, revised, or never written. For another, it is uniform—not subject to hundreds of different licensing standards. Finally and most important, private censorship can be more sweeping in its demands, because it is not bound by constitutional due process or free-expression rules—in general, these apply to only the government—or by the command of church-state separation … {{there is no question that}} American cinema today is far freer than in the heyday of the Code, when Joe Breen's blue pencil and the Legion of Decency's ever-present boycott threat combined to assure that films adhered to Catholic Church doctrine.|$|E
5|$|Exercise {{therapy is}} {{effective}} in decreasing pain and improving function for those with chronic low back pain. It also appears to reduce recurrence rates {{for as long as}} six months after the completion of program and improves long-term function. There is no evidence that one particular type of exercise therapy <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> another. The Alexander technique appears useful for chronic back pain, and there is tentative evidence to support the use of yoga. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) has not been found to be effective in chronic low back pain. Evidence for the use of shoe insoles as a treatment is inconclusive. Peripheral nerve stimulation, a minimally-invasive procedure, may be useful in cases of chronic low back pain that do not respond to other measures, although the evidence supporting it is not conclusive, and it is not effective for pain that radiates into the leg.|$|E
5|$|The {{circumcision}} procedure causes pain, and for neonates {{this pain}} {{may interfere with}} mother-infant interaction or cause other behavioral changes, so the use of analgesia is advocated. Ordinary procedural pain may be managed in pharmacological and non-pharmacological ways. Pharmacological methods, such as localized or regional pain-blocking injections and topical analgesic creams, are safe and effective. The ring block and dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) are the most effective at reducing pain, and the ring block {{may be more effective}} than the DPNB. They are more effective than EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anesthetics) cream, which <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> a placebo. Topical creams have been found to irritate the skin of low birth weight infants, so penile nerve block techniques are recommended in this group.|$|E

5|$|Critics {{reported}} that players rarely {{need to use}} Undead Nightmare new weapons. Whitehead (Eurogamer) said that Marston's firearms are mostly indistinguishable apart from the blunderbuss, which is only useful when the player is overrun by zombies. GameSpot added that the game's combat is repetitive and less fun in the expansion, as zombies barely pose a threat. The zombies, without guns, cover, horses, lack the complexities of cowboys and, apart {{from some of the}} special zombie types, are only a threat at short distances. The reviewer found little variation between weapons when firing at close range, which <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> aiming at a distance. The fun of the new guns quickly faded for the critic, who found little incentive to use traditional gunfight strategies. Whitehead (Eurogamer) too noted that the base game relied on its use of cover during gunfights, which the expansion jettisons altogether. Thus the player is forced into the technique of backtracking and turning to use the time-slowing Dead Eye mode to clear zombies with headshots. The reviewer also found the controls clumsy and often tripped on piles of zombie bodies or became stuck in doorways. While the idea of zombie animals scared Whitehead, he was both relieved and disappointed to find that bears and cougars, like the humans, died with a single bullet.|$|E
