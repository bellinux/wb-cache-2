2500|$|There is some {{evidence}} from comparative phylogenetic analysis and epidemic simulations that HIV adapts {{at the level of}} the population to maximize transmission potential between hosts. This adaptation is towards intermediate virulence levels, which balances the productive lifetime of the <b>host</b> (<b>time</b> until AIDS) with the transmission probability per act. A useful proxy for virulence is the set-point viral load (SPVL), which is correlated with the time until AIDS. SPVL is the quasi-equilibrium titer of viral particles in the blood during chronic infection. For adaptation towards intermediate virulence to be possible, SPVL needs to be heritable and a trade-off between viral transmissibility and the lifespan of the host needs to exist. [...] SPVL has been shown to be correlated between HIV donor and recipients in transmission pairs, thereby providing evidence that SPVL is at least partly heritable. The transmission probability of HIV per sexual act is positively correlated with viral load, thereby providing evidence of the trade-off between transmissibility and virulence. It is therefore theoretically possible that HIV evolves to maximize its transmission potential. Epidemiological simulation and comparative phylogenetic studies have shown that adaptation of HIV towards optimum SPVL could be expected over 100–150 years. These results depend on empirical estimates for the transmissibility of HIV and the lifespan of hosts as a function of SPVL.|$|E

50|$|To allow programmers to use {{a larger}} virtual address space than is {{actually}} available in the RAM, CPUs (or hosts, {{in the language of}} GPGPU) implement a virtual memory system Virtual memory (non-locked / non-pinned memory) in which a physical memory page may be swapped out to disk. When the host needs that page, it loads it back in from the disk. The drawback with CPU⟷GPU memory transfers is that memory transactions are slower, i.e., the bandwidth of the PCI-E bus to connect CPU and GPU is not fully exploited. Non-locked / non-pinned memory does not reside only in main memory (e.g. it can be in swap), so the driver needs to access every single page of the non-locked memory, copy it into pinned buffer and pass it to the Direct Memory Access (DMA) (synchronously page-by-page copy). Indeed, PCI-E transfers occur only using the DMA. Accordingly, when a “normal” transfer is issued, an allocation of a block of page-locked memory is necessary, followed by a host copy from regular memory to the page-locked / pinned one, the transfer, the wait for the transfer to complete and the deletion of the page-locked / pinned memory. This consumes precious <b>host</b> <b>time</b> which is avoided when directly using page-fixed memory.|$|E

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 26 - 29, 1998 / Town & Country Resort Hotel and Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaThe Space Sensing & Vehicle Control Branch of the Air Force Research Laboratory and Voss Scientific, Albuquerque, NM, are {{developing}} an advanced PC and COTS-based satellite telemetry processing, analysis and display system {{known as the}} PC-Satellite Telemetry Server (PC-STS).

40|$|Invertebrate pathologists have {{multiple}} definitions for the terms pathogenicity and virulence, and these definitions vary across disciplines {{that focus on}} host/pathogen interactions. We surveyed various literatures and found most define pathogenicity as the broader term, which incorporates virulence. Virulence {{is seen as the}} severity of disease manifestation that can only be measured in infected individuals. The effectiveness of pathogens as biological control agents is thought to be related to their virulence. ^ E. maimaiga, a fungal pathogen of gypsy moths, has had variable success as a biological control agent in North America. I compared the pathogenicity and virulence of American isolates of E. maimaiga to Japanese isolates with injection and dipping bioassays and found no consistent difference in LD 50 and LT 50 between the isolates from each country, when tested on a laboratory colony. I also found contrary to some reports, the Michigan isolate was the fastest killing and had the lowest LD 50 of any isolate that I tested. I then compared the virulence of a Japanese and a North American isolate of E. maimaiga on gypsy moths from Japan, and North America as well as the standard laboratory strain (New Jersey strain) from North America. I found that North American gypsy moths were the most susceptible for both isolates in terms of median number dying and time till death of infected larvae. We also found that the fungal isolates produced more spores when they infected hosts on which they were naturally found. ^ When I examined the within host dynamics of E. maimaiga, I found hyphal bodies seen as early as 4 days after infection which corresponded with the within <b>host</b> <b>time</b> needed to survive the premature death of the host. After four rounds of selection for increased growth within the host, I saw a decline in replication rate of the pathogen; however, both median number killed and time to kill increased as measured with injection bioassays. These results were also compared to theoretical predictions made by Ebert and Weisser 2 ̆ 7 s (1997) model for optimal virulence. ...|$|E

40|$|Background: In {{parasitic}} taxa, {{life history}} traits such as microhabitat preference and host specificity {{can result in}} differential evolutionary responses to similar abiotic events. The present study investigates the influence of vicariance and host association on the genetic structure of two generalist flea species, Listropsylla agrippinae, and Chiastopsylla rossi. The taxa differ in the time spent on the host (predominantly fur vs. nest) and level of host specificity. Results: A total of 1056 small mammals were brushed to collect 315 fleas originating from 20 geographically distinct localities in South Africa. Phylogeographic genetic structure of L. agrippinae and C. rossi were determined by making use of 315 mitochondrial COII and 174 nuclear EF 1 -α sequences. Both parasites show significant genetic differentiation among {{the majority of the}} sampling sites confirming limited dispersal ability for fleas. The generalist fur flea with a narrower host range, L. agrippinae, displayed geographic mtDNA spatial genetic structure at the regional scale and this pattern is congruent with host vicariance. The dating of the divergence between the L. agrippinae geographic clades co-insides with paleoclimatic changes in the region approximately 5. 27 Ma and this provides some evidence for a co-evolutionary scenario. In contrast, the more host opportunistic nest flea, C. rossi, showed a higher level of mtDNA and nDNA spatial genetic structure at the inter-populational scale, most likely attributed to comparatively higher restrictions to dispersal. Conclusions: In the present study, the evolutionary history of the flea species could best be explained by the association between parasite and <b>host</b> (<b>time</b> spent on the host). The phylogeographic pattern of the fur flea with a narrower host range correspond to host spatial genetic structures, while the pattern in the host opportunistic nest flea correspond to higher genetic divergences between sampling localities that may also be associated with higher effective population sizes. These findings suggest that genetic exchange among localities are most likely explained by differences in the dispersal abilities and life histories of the flea species. [URL] Versio...|$|E
40|$|Cry 1 Ab toxin {{derived from}} Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) {{has been used}} for the control of {{susceptible}} lepidopteran species throughout the world. Currently, sprayable Bt formulations and transgenic plants have been used for lepidopteran pest control. As plants and insects are part of a complex multitrophic system, using Bt toxin may also affect non-target organisms and thus pose an environmental risk. This research was conducted under controlled laboratory conditions – first tier lab testing on the second (Spodoptera littoralis) and third trophic levels (Cotesia marginiventris). Spodoptera littoralis were fed with four different types of maize leaves; non-transgenic isogenic control, transgenic (MON 810), and isogenic control plants sprayed with a control spray or Bt spray (Dipel). S. littoralis larvae maintained on non-transgenic maize leaves from day 6 to day 20 were significantly heavier when compared to the other maize treatments. No significant effect of Cry 1 Ab toxin was observed on the survival and pupation time of S. littoralis larvae. The groups exposed to transgenic maize were shown to have the lowest weight of parasitized S. littoralis larvae at 2 and 5 days after parasitism, and also the lowest weight of parasitoid cocoon. The behaviour of Cotesia marginiventris with S. littoralis hosts (same age or same size) in no-choice tests was observed. Time taken to the first attack took significantly longer in the same-age host fed either transgenic maize or Bt spray maize when compared to control maize-fed hosts, however this did not differ in the same-size <b>host.</b> <b>Time</b> to cocoon formation and adult emergence was significantly shorter in the same-age larvae fed on non-transgenic maize when compared to other maize-fed hosts. In the parasitoid developed within same-size hosts, no significant differences in the time to cocoon formation and adult emergence were observed. Moreover, the number of parasitoid cocoons and adults were significantly higher in the same-age host fed on non-transgenic maize, while in the same-size hosts showed no significant difference in these numbers. The results would suggest the attack of parasitoid {{may be due to the}} size and age of the hosts. To conclude, the low parasitism and non-emergence of parasitoids observed may be due to the decreased quality of hosts that can not provide sufficient nutrients for development of parasitoid larvae. This present study has helped to understand the direct or indirect effects of Cry 1 Ab on the non-target insects in the tri-trophic systems that could lead to the changes on host-parasitoid population dynamics in the ecosystem. The ecological relevance of the present study is discussed within a wider context of risk assessment in the environment...|$|E
