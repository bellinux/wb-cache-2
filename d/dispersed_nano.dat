The unique nature of the filler particles of nanocomposites provides mechanical strength and wear resistance similar to hybrid composites, and superior polish and gloss retention similar to micro fill composites.

We have also showed {{for the first}} time that aluminum powders can be processed without lubes via press and sintering to 100 % density. This will preclude a delube cycle in sintering and promote environmentally friendly P/M processing. Processing aluminum powders via press and sintering with minimum shrinkage will enable net shape fabrication. Aluminum powders processed via a conventional powder metallurgy process produce too large a shrinkage. Because of this, sinter parts have to be machined into specific net shape.

Zero-valent iron is viewed as an ideal reactive material for PRBs by means of its high sorption/reduction capacity towards various toxic ions. Zero-valent iron synthesized in nanoscale has a greater affinity to reduce/adsorb various toxic aqueous ions {{by virtue of its}} large surface area. In this work, nanoscaled (10 - 100 nm) zero-valent iron (nZVI) was synthesized in ethanol by borohydride reduction method in atmospheric conditions. It was observed that iron nanoparticles are mainly in zero-valent oxidation state and that they remain without significant oxidation for weeks. To enhance its effect and usability, nZVI was supported by kaolinite and montmorillonite during synthesis. Characterization of those clay-supported nZVI was performed using XRD, SEM, TEM, EELS, XPS, Zeta Meter, BET-N 2. Iron nanoparticles consist of a zero-valent core and a surrounding oxide shell with approximate thickness of 3 - 5 nm. The application of clays as support materials have led to a partial decrease in the aggregation of iron nanoparticles known to normally form chain-like structure. The diameter of unsupported iron nanoparticles was predominently within the range 20 - 80 nm, while clay-supported iron nanoparticles existing as <b>dispersed</b> <b>nano</b> spheres had particle diameters within 10 - 50 nm. The synthesized materials were applied as adsorbents for Co 2 + and Cu 2 + ions.

While Co 2 + seems to be fixed via the oxohydroxyl groups on the surface of iron nanoparticles, Cu 2 + was fixed by a redox mechanism that lead to formation of Cu 2 O and Cu 0.

The mechanical and metallurgical properties of the produced composite are characterized by, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), optical microscopy, and tensile testing DIN 50125. Findings: MWCNTs are successfully incorporated into the A 356 melt up to 1. 5 % weight fraction. SEM analysis revealed a uniform dispersion of MWCNTs with good interfacial bonding between the matrix and the MWCNTs. The ultimate tensile strength and elongation of the produced composite are increased by 34 % and 250 % respectively compared to their corresponding values of monolithic alloy. Research limitations/implications: The research was carried out based on MWCNTs only with a range of percentage additions; it could be extended to single Walled CNTs and graphene sheets with different percentage additions.

To increase non volatile polarization at low poling field and to increase pyroelectric coefficient, LiTaO 3 (LT) nano particles were added to PVDF matrix to make LT/PVDF composite. It is important to study the dielectric properties of the composite (to be used in detector application) because dielectric constant varies with volume fraction of filler and with frequency.

The dielectric properties of LT/PVDF composite were studied by varying the volume fraction of LT. The dielectric permittivity of LT/ PVDF composites increased compared to PVDF as the volume fraction of LT increases but the loss tangent is almost constant at higher frequency. In low frequency region, for fLT = 0. 17 the dielectric permittivity of composite is greater than PVDF and LT. The dielectric loss tangent is also increased from 0. 04 to 0. 175 as fLT increases from 0 to 0. 17 at 1 kHz. The dielectric permittivity behavior of composite has been explained using percolation model and space charge polarization model. Comment: Please send your comments(20 pages with figures...|$|R
40|$|Selective laser melting (SLM) offers {{significant}} {{potential for}} the manufacture of the advanced complex-shaped aluminium matrix composites (AMCs) used in the aerospace and automotive domains. Previous {{studies have indicated that}} advanced composite powders suitable for SLM include spherical powders with homogeneous reinforcement distribution, a particle size of < 100 μm and good flowability (Carr index < 15 %); however, the production of such composite powders continues to be a challenge. Due to the intensive impacts of grinding balls, the high-energy ball-milling (HEBM) process has been employed to refine Al particles and <b>disperse</b> the <b>nano</b> Al 2 O 3 reinforcements in the Al matrix to improve their mechanical properties. Notwithstanding, the specific characteristics of ball-milled powders for SLM and the effect of milling and pause duration on the fabrication of composite powders have not previously been investigated. The aim {{of this study was to}} synthesise Al- 4 vol. % Al 2 O 3 nano-composite powders using HEBM with two different types of milling and pause combinations. The characteristics of the powders subjected to up to 20 h of milling were investigated. The short milling (10 min) and long pause (15 min) combination provided a higher yield (66 %) and narrower particle size distribution range than long milling (15 min) and a short pause (5 min). The nano Al 2 O 3 reinforcements were observed to be dispersed uniformly after 20 h of milling, and the measured Carr index of 13. 2 % indicated that the ball-milled powder offered good flowability. Vickers micro-hardness tests indicated that HEBM significantly improved the mechanical properties of the ball-milled powders...|$|R
40|$|Controlling {{the shape}} {{and size of the}} layered {{inorganic-organic}} hybrid particles is a challenge with conventional methods of synthesis. The co-precipitation method has been modified to synthesize Mg/Al Layered double hydroxide by controlling the particle growth using ultrasonic wave at the time of nucleation. In this project, magnesium and aluminum ions were considered as model systems with carbonate anion as intercalating agent. The resulting particles are compared with those of LDHs produced by conventional co-precipitation method at constant pH. Powder X-ray diffraction confirmed formation of the layered double hydroxide phases having crystallite size 19 - 20 nm in both 'a' and 'c' crystallographic directions. Transmission electron microscope and dynamic light scattering revealed <b>nano</b> <b>disperse</b> hexagonal platelets with narrow size distribution and average size was around 48 nm. The modified method reduces the particle size, increases the surface charge, narrows down the size distribution and also reduces the aspect ratio of the particles. Therefore, it is suggested that low amplitude ultrasonic wave prevents the aggregation of the nuclei, thus restricting the particle growth and results in uniform size particles...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to enhance {{solubility}} and dissolution rate of poorly water soluble drug. Several techniques such as micronisation, cyclodextrin-complexation, use of surfactants, solubilizers and super disintegrants, solid dispersion in water soluble and water dispersible carriers, microemulsions and self emulsifying micro and <b>nano</b> <b>disperse</b> systems have been used to enhance the solubility and dissolution rate of poorly water soluble drugs. Among the various approaches solid dispersion technique is most widely used. Cefdinir is a drug of choice for solubility and dissolution enhancement. Solid dispersions were prepared by solvent evaporation method and melt fusion method using polyethylene glycol 3350 and PVP-K 30 as hydrophilic carriers. The prepared solid dispersions were evaluated in terms of drug content, % yield and in-vitro dissolution study. In-vitro release profiles of all dispersions were comparitively evaluated and also studied against pure cefdinir. The results obtained showed that the rate of dissolution of cefdinir was considerably improved when formulated in solid dispersions as compare to pure drug.
