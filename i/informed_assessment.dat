500|$|Bush's {{music was}} {{under-represented}} in the concert repertoire in his lifetime, and virtually disappeared after his death. The 2000 centenary {{of his birth}} was markedly low key; the Prom season ignored him, {{although there was a}} memorial concert at the Wigmore Hall on 1 November, and a BBC broadcast of the Piano Concerto on 19 December. [...] The centenary, albeit [...] quietly observed, helped to introduce the name and music of Bush to a new generation of music lovers, and generated an increase in both performance and recordings. The centenary also heralded an awakening of scholarly interest in Bush, whose life and works were the subject of numerous PhD theses in the early 20th century. Scholars such as Paul Harper-Scott and Joanna Bullivant have obtained access to new material, including documents released since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and Bush's MI5 file. [...] This, says Bullivant, enables a more <b>informed</b> <b>assessment</b> of the interrelationships within [...] Bush's music and his communism, and of the inherent conflicting priorities.|$|E

In the following we briefly summarize all the published studies of which we are aware that explored the relationship between sensitivity or response bias on tests of face recognition and performance in CP or CA lineup identification tasks.

The aim was to allow market participants access to standardised timely information on loans and their performance. Access to this information should allow market actors to make more <b>informed</b> <b>assessments</b> of asset backed securities. The Eurosystem believed that the new data requirements would help both investors and third-party assessment providers with their due diligence.

30|$|As public {{discourse}} on available food for consumption and local production continues in Hawai‘i, it becomes apparent that state benchmark estimates {{are required to}} track market requirements and their supply sources. Food import measures are not readily available and this paper is intended to fill that gap by providing a more <b>informed</b> <b>assessment</b> of the market place by bringing together information from published data sources, industry technical reports, and informed industry sources. While the goal is straight forward, the technical efforts required to benchmark the estimates from diverging sources into a meaningful common denominator are far more challenging.
