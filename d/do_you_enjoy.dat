Depend on it, there are discomforts in the progress to the brazen, in the journey to the shameless. You may, if your tattle is political, become serviceable to men engaged in great affairs. They may even ask you to their houses, if that is your ambition. You may urge that they condone your deeds, and are even art and part in them.

60|$|A youth, in {{choosing}} a career, must not be alarmed by poverty. Want is a sore thing, but poverty does not imply want. It {{remains to be seen}} whether with half his present income, or a third, he cannot, in the most generous sense, live as fully as at present. He is a fool who objects to luxuries; but he is also a fool who does not protest against the waste of luxuries on those who do not desire and cannot enjoy them. It remains to be seen, by each man who would live a true life to himself and not a merely specious life to society, how many luxuries he truly wants and to how many he merely submits as to a social propriety; and all these last he will immediately forswear. Let him do this, and he will be surprised to find how little money it requires to keep him in complete contentment and activity of mind and senses. Life at any level among the easy classes is conceived upon a principle of rivalry, where each man and each household must ape the tastes and emulate the display of others. One is delicate in eating, another in wine, a third in furniture or works of art or dress; and I, who care nothing for any of these refinements, who am perhaps a plain athletic creature and love exercise, beef, beer, flannel shirts and a camp bed, am yet called upon to assimilate all these other tastes and make these foreign occasions of expenditure my own. It may be cynical: I am sure I shall be told it is selfish; but I will spend my money as I please and for my own intimate personal gratification, and should count myself a nincompoop indeed to lay out the colour of a halfpenny on any fancied social decency or duty. I shall not wear gloves unless my hands are cold, or unless I am born with a delight in them. Dress is my own affair, and that of one other in the world; that, in fact and for an obvious reason, of any woman who shall chance to be in love with me. I shall lodge where I have a mind. If I do not ask society to live with me, they must be silent; and even if I do, they have no further right but to refuse the invitation! There is a kind of idea abroad that a man must live up to his station, that his house, his table, and his toilette, shall be in a ratio of equivalence, and equally imposing to the world.

5000|$|Upon the 92nd Division’s {{entry into}} French soil, it {{was moved to}} the St. Dre Sector to relief the 5th Regular U.S. Army Division (composed of white soldiers). Only a few days later had the 5th Regular Division {{captured}} the village of Frapelle. Immediately, these fresh African American recruits were submerged into the harsh terrain of the trenches where the Germans had been sending aggressive assaults, such as frequent released of gassing shells to Allied troops. In mid September Frapelle face a heavy German bombardment as an airplane duel came into the mixture. With aerial and artillery fire coming from many sides, Lt. Brown was on full deck. At some point during the attack, the Germans learned that the opposing force that faced them, the 92nd Division, was composed entirely of African Americans. The Germans decided to change tactics and went into the trenches. The U.S. troops believed that the Germans were sending another surge of gassing shells, however, when nothing emitted from the shells they went to investigate. Within the shells was a printed propaganda written in English. It was titled “To the Colored Soldiers of the American Army”. The text continued saying: [...] “Hello, boys, what are you doing over here? Fighting the Germans? Why? Have they ever done you any harm? Of course some white folks and the lying English-American papers told you that the Germans ought to be wiped out for the sake of Humanity and Democracy.What is Democracy? Personal freedom, all citizens enjoying the same rights socially and before the law. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>enjoy</b> the same rights as the white people do in America, the land of Freedom and Democracy, or are you rather not treated over there as second-class citizens? Can you go into a restaurant where white people dine? Can you get a seat in the theater where white people sit? Can you get a seat or a berth in the railroad car, or can you even ride, in the South, in the same street car with white people? And how about the law? Is lynching and the most horrible crimes connected therewith a lawful proceeding in a democratic country? Now, this is all different in Germany, where they do like colored people, where they treat them as gentlemen and as white people, and quite a number of colored people have fine positions in business in Berlin and other German cities. Why, then, fight the Germans only {{for the benefit of the}} Wall street robbers and to protect the millions they have loaned to the British, French, and Italians? You have been made the tool of the egotistic and rapacious rich in England and in America, and there is nothing in the whole game for you but broken bones, horrible wounds, spoiled health, or death. No satisfaction whatever will you get out of this unjust war. You have never seen Germany. So you are fools if you allow people to make you hate us. Come over and see for yourself. Let those do the fighting who make the profit out of this war. Don't allow them to use you as cannon fodder. To carry a gun in this war is not an honor, but a shame. Throw it away and come over into the German lines. You will find friends who will help you along”.|$|E

40|$|Before {{you start}} the search, {{take some time to}} think about your lifestyle, interests, and what {{activities}} you enjoy. Are your interests specific to waterfront property? Or would a property near, but not on, the water be a good choice? Scenic lakes and rivers have lured families to their shores for generations to fish, boat and swim. Once at the lake, people discover more – like the fun of seeing a family of otters playing among the lily pads, and the majestic sight of a bald eagle soaring above sparkling blue waters. If you are thinking about buying waterfront property in Wisconsin, this guide is meant for you. A little time invested in learning about waterfront living will pay back sizable dividends in matching your expectations to the realities. This guide provides: Ideas to consider before you start your property search • Considerations to help you decide on the right lake or river Factors to help you choose just the right property The questions below may help get you thinking: Why do you want to own waterfront property? How far are you willing to drive? How do you envision spending time there? How many times a year {{will you be able to}} visit when you consider your other time commitments? Will you be able to stay all summer or just on weekends? Would renting a cottage or condo be more affordable in the long run? How often will you have guests? What types of recreation <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>enjoy?</b> Do you want a quiet lake for fishing and enjoying nature, or a busy lake for waterskiing and big parties? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>enjoy</b> yard work? Or would you rather sit back and take in the scenery? Will you landscape or enjoy the native vegetation? Are you willing to help take care of the lake or river and accept the regulations and restrictions that may be in place to protect it? Are you willing to share your waterfront with others?

40|$|Drawing on {{the classic}} model of {{balanced}} affect proposed by Bradburn (The structure of psychological well-being, Aldine, Chicago, IL, 1969), this study conceptualised poor work-related psychological health in terms of high levels of negative affect {{in the absence of}} acceptable levels of positive affect. In order to illuminate self-perceptions of work-related psychological health among a well-defined group of clergy, a random sample of 58 ministers of word and sacrament serving within the west midlands synod of the United Reformed Church in England completed an open-ended questionnaire concerned with the following six guiding questions. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>enjoy</b> your work? How would you define stress? How would you define burnout? What stresses are there in your ministry? What do you do to keep healthy? What can the church do to enhance the work-related psychological health of ministers? Content analysis highlighted the main themes recurring through these open-ended responses. The conclusion is drawn that ministers of word and sacrament within the United Reformed Church in England are exposed to a number of recurrent recognisable sources of stress. Suggestions are advanced regarding the need for future more detailed research and for the development of more effective pastoral strategies...|$|E
