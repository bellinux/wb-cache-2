5|$|Following Italy's September 1911 {{invasion}} of Libya, al-Qassam began collecting funds in Jableh {{for the joint}} Ottoman-Libyan resistance movement and composed a victory anthem. Jableh's <b>district</b> <b>governor</b> sought to gain control over the fundraiser and when locals nevertheless continued to send their donations to al-Qassam, he attempted to have him jailed. The <b>district</b> <b>governor</b> alleged that al-Qassam was working against the Ottoman state, but an official investigation found him not guilty and the governor was consequently dismissed.|$|E
5|$|Aqil angered the kaimakam (<b>district</b> <b>governor)</b> of Acre, Muhammad Kubrisi, for his {{intervention}} {{in a dispute}} between two factions of the Catholic Church in Nazareth. One {{of the leaders of}} the Catholic factions, Sheikh Yusef Elias, had been dismissed by the church and subsequently entered Aqil's protection. He requested Aqil's intercession with Kubrisi, which was unsuccessful. When Sheikh Yusef decided to take matters into his own hands by raising a group of armed partisans in Nazareth, the church was compelled to restore his employment. Kubrisi believed Aqil had backed Sheikh Yusef's actions and accused Aqil of sedition. Kubrisi recalled Aqil and his Hawwara irregulars to Acre, verbally lambasted them and dismissed them all from service. Aqil was deeply insulted by Kubrisi's words and actions, and subsequently left for Transjordan where he sought the protection of the Beni Sakhr tribe.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, {{the valley}} was {{dominated}} by the Kingdom of Lunda of Mwata Kazembe. The boundaries of the province between Zambia and DR Congo were disputed for many years, running from an 1894 treaty into the late 1960s. The province {{has a long history}} of opposing colonial rule through militancy. From the 1950s, there were revolutionary groups that supported the Anti Federationist African National Congress. Post independence, the province was the base for the United National Independence Party (UNIP) militants. Laupula has constant migration of labour from DR Congo and also from nearby Copperbelt Province. During the 1980s, the then President Kenneth Kaunda appointed traditional Chiefs of the region as District Governors or members of the powerful UNIP central committee. The practice was seen similar to colonial rule when local leaders were drafted to political domain. Mwata Kazambe was appointed the <b>District</b> <b>Governor</b> for the province by the President during the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|Initially, Hananu logistically {{supported}} the guerrilla operations of Barakat against the French in the Antioch region. He later decided {{to organize a}} rebellion in Aleppo and its countryside. Hananu was motivated to act {{by what he saw}} as the ineffectiveness of the Syrian National Congress, the legislative body of Faisal's state of which Hananu was a member, in preventing French rule. He may also have been encouraged by Rashid al-Tali'a, the Arab government's <b>district</b> <b>governor</b> of Hama, who had been supporting Saleh al-Ali and the Alawite-dominated revolt he was leading against the French in the Syrian coastal mountains. Meanwhile, the Syrian National Congress proclaimed the establishment of the Arab Kingdom of Syria in March 1920. France was wary that a popular nationalist movement emanating from Faisal's kingdom could spread to Lebanon and French territories in North Africa, and moved {{to put an end to}} Faisal's state. Anti-French resistance manifested at local level as the Committees of National Defense, which began springing up in Aleppo and its hinterland. The committees were founded by members of the local elite, many of whom were sympathetic to Ottoman rule, but the committees quickly became fueled by populist agitation against French colonialism.|$|E
5|$|Pivljanin's tactics {{included}} quick raids {{and destroying}} bridges as he retreated. For example, the stone bridge on the Tara in Šiplje was destroyed after his band had raided Kolašin. In 1664, Pivljanin is {{mentioned as a}} hajduk commander active in the Republic of Ragusa. At the beginning of August 1664, hajduk leaders Stevo and Nikola Popović, Vukosav Puhalović, Pivljanin, Dijete, Čauš, and others, destroyed a merchant caravan {{on the border with}} Ragusa, and took 150 cargoes of very expensive goods; Armenian merchants, to whom the goods belonged, complained to the Doge of Venice. The Venetian government warned the hajduks against further provocations of the Ottomans, fearing new attacks from Sohrab Mehmed Pasha, the sanjak-bey of Herzegovina. In ca. 1665, Pivljanin suffered a great defeat by the Ottomans at the village of Grdijevići, losing most of his band and being forced to leave his home region. One hundred and fifty years later, rebels on the Tara used this event, among others, as justification for a revolt. At the beginning of May 1666, Pivljanin raided a Ragusan ship off the coast of Koločep that was bound for Venice with merchandise, unloading eight wagons of wax and freeing captured merchants, among whom were four Turks, in return for a high payment and a written statement that the wax and money had been given to him voluntarily. The Ragusans claimed {{that at the time of}} the raid, Pivljanin had shouted that the provveditore (<b>district</b> <b>governor)</b> of Venetian Dalmatia had given him the order to take all that he came across, both on the sea and the land. Five days later, Pivljanin raided a large and unusually rich caravan carrying Venetian merchandise through Ottoman territory. In September 1666, Pivljanin and Mato Njegošević attacked an Ottoman caravan in Mosko then retreated to Banjani.|$|E

40|$|This thesis explores how and to {{what extent}} the public {{administration}} reforms introduced in the 2000 s have affected the roles of <b>governors</b> and <b>district</b> <b>governors</b> in Turkey and to identify the intended and unintended consequences of the public administration reforms and their implications for roles of <b>governors</b> and <b>district</b> <b>governors.</b> This topic is important because in 2001, Turkey was hit by a large economic crisis which affected the country negatively. After that economic crisis, many public administration reforms, which were inspired by some of the ideas of the New Public Management, were introduced in the 2000 s in Turkey in order to ensure the effectiveness, efficiency, productivity, transparency, openness and accountability of the public administration and the delivery of public services by reconstructing how the public administration operates. The public administration reforms have changed the structure, roles, and responsibilities of both the central and local governments, as well as the traditional understanding of the public administrators. After these reforms were implemented, the main administrative structure of the provincial administrative system was shaken, with the roles, powers, responsibilities, and even the reason for the <b>governors</b> and <b>district</b> governors' existence being called into question. This research is done by conducting both a survey (with 304 out of the 1426 responding) and semi-structured elite interviews with 65 governors, deputy <b>governors,</b> and <b>district</b> <b>governors.</b> The major findings of the research are, firstly, that the classical traditional and historically important roles and powers of the <b>governors</b> and <b>district</b> <b>governors</b> have been eroded with local governments gaining power and roles at their expense. So, secondly, the mayors are now more prominent than the civil administrators. Three further effects on <b>governors</b> and <b>district</b> <b>governors</b> are found. One is that their roles have become increasingly politicised and the other is that they have had to shift their philosophy from the state-centric view to the citizen-centric one. And lastly, new roles have emerged...|$|R
