Em laboratório e campo, O. sokolowskii foi exposto às densidades de 2, 4, 8 e 16 lagartas. Em laboratório, empregaram-se recipientes de 300 mL e, em campo, plantas de couve foram confinadas em gaiolas de organza (30 x 50 cm). Em casa telada, foram utilizadas microparcelas compostas por seis plantas de repolho infestadas com 25, 50, 85 ou 100 lagartas. O número de lagartas parasitadas aumentou de acordo com a densidade do hospedeiro e variou de 1, 7 a 10, 4, em laboratório, e de 0, 61 a 7, 0, em campo. Em casa telada, a maior taxa de parasitismo foi observada nas microparcelas com densidades mais elevadas do hospedeiro. O tempo de exposição aos parasitoides proporcionou maior taxa de parasitismo após 72 horas (24 horas, 52, 4 % e 72 horas, 80, 7 %) independentemente da densidade. Oomyzus sokolowskii responde positivamente ao incremento na densidade de P. xylostella, embora a taxa de parasitismo permaneça constante independentemente da disponibilidade do hospedeiro. The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the parasitism capacity of the larval-pupal parasitoid Oomyzus sokolowskii submitted to different densities of the host diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, in the laboratory, greenhouse and field. In the laboratory and in the field, O. sokolowskii was exposed to densities of 2, 4, 8 or 16 larvae. In the laboratory, 300 mL recipient were used, and in the <b>field</b> <b>kale</b> plants were placed in cages (30 x 50 cm). In the greenhouse, microparcels consisted of six cabbage plants each infested with 25, 50, 85 or 100 larvae. The number of parasitized larvae increased with host density and varied from 1. 7 to 10. 4 (laboratory) and from 0. 61 to 7. 0 (field). In the greenhouse, parasitism rate was higher in microparcels with higher host infestation. The time of exposition was significant, with higher parasitism rate at 72 hours after host exposure (24 hour, 52. 4 %; and 72 hour, 80. 7 %), irrespective of host density. Oomyzus sokolowskii responds to increases in host density, but maintains the parasitism rate unchanged irrespective of variations in the host availability...|$|E

40|$|Studies {{related with}} the flight {{activity}} of aphids captured with traps {{can be useful}} to predict the appearance of alate forms in the field. It is also useful to understand the population dynamics of those insects. This work was carried out at the Faculdade de Ciências Agrárias e Veterinárias, Universidade Estadual Paulista, Jaboticabal, State of São Paulo, {{during the period from}} July 1997 to December 1999, aiming to determine the population curve of alate Brevicoryne brassicae (L.) in the region of Jaboticabal and the influence meteorological factors plays on it. The population survey was carried out in four places, and the alate aphids were sampled by yellow water traps. The influence of air temperature, relative humidity, rainfall and sunshine brightness was verified using stepwise regression. The first captures of alate B. brassicae in the traps began at the end of June. In the region of Jaboticabal, the population curve of alate B. brassicae showed the highest frequency of flights during September. The appearance of alate forms in <b>kale</b> <b>fields</b> at initial stage of development was favored by maximum and minimum temperatures of 26. 4 °C and 13. 5 °C, respectively; relative humidity of 75. 1 %, and reduced rainfall...|$|R
40|$|The {{microbiota}} soil has {{an important}} role {{as an indicator of}} the sustainability of agroecosystems, reflecting the environmental changes, particularly the antrophic actions. To evaluate the influence of different fertilizers in populations of Pseudomonas spp, in the common kale was conducted a <b>field</b> experiment with <b>kale</b> at the Agrobiology Embrapa National Center, in Seropédica, RJ, on a Argisol. The experimental design was random blocks in factorial 3 x 4, with treatments (home biosolid, cattle manure and urea fertilization), four dose levels (0, 100, 200 and 400 kg de N. ha- 1) and four replicates. The amount of fertilizer applied was given according to the dosage of nitrogen. ha- 1 desired. From the rhizosphere, at 15 and 30 days after transplanting the seedlings to the field, we selected strains showing fluorescence under UV light with a wavelength of 366 nm. For grouping the isolates were considered the main morphological characteristics. The majority being identified as Pseudomonas putida (54 %) and P. fluorescens (14 %), by API 20 NE System (bioMérieux, Analytab Products). The results obtained from the reactions of the API 20 NE test kit showed a wide variation in the utilization of carbon compounds and enzymatic inter-and intraspecific. Some groups of isolates colonized preferentially the cabbage rhizosphere of plants fertilized with biosolids and different doses of fertilizers used. There were a smaller number of groups present in treatments with urea...|$|R
40|$|Whilst not a ‘new’ pest in the UK, Aleyrodes proletella {{has become}} an {{increasing}} problem for the Brassica industry in recent years, especially on Brussels sprout and kale. The reason for the increasing problem is unknown, but it {{is believed to be}} due to a combination of climate change, removal of certain active ingredients from use and later harvest times of crops. Relatively little research has focused on this species as, historically; it has been regarded as a minor pest. Knowledge about the biology of A. proletella is limited and some of what is currently understood about its ecology has been inferred from anecdotal evidence. The overall aim of this project is to understand population trends of A. proletella in the most vulnerable crops, Brussels sprout and kale. This includes understanding the key times of population increase and colonisation of new crops. This information can then be used to inform the development of an integrated control strategy using insecticides and other tools, which might include biological control agents and methods of cultural or physical control. Experiments to investigate the vertical and horizontal distribution of flights by A. proletella showed that A. proletella performs mainly low, short distance flights throughout most of the year and it is these flights that are mostly responsible for colonisation of new vulnerable crops, which can be achieved by overwintering females early in the season. Monitoring of <b>field</b> populations on <b>kale</b> has shown that populations of whitefly develop without regulation by predators or parasitoids, with increases in numbers mostly determined by the development of further generations from the initial immigrants to the crop. The size of a population of A. proletella that can be achieved within a crop seems to be governed by the number of generations that can develop before the onset of diapause in September, which prevents further reproduction. A new fungal pathogen, which causes epizootics within the field, has been observed. This killed up to > 90...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1992 The diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella L.) {{is a major}} pest of {{crucifer}} crops worldwide. It is {{a particularly}} important problem in Southeast Asia where climatic conditions favor a short generation time and rapid proliferation. In countries such as Thailand, the diamondback moth has apparently become resistant to all classes of insecticides, even the newest ones. The {{first part of this}} thesis is the development of a computer database of all the available information on diamondback moth toxicology. About 1, 550 records were extracted from more than 235 published or unpublished documents. These records include information on the geographical location of experiments, the insecticide evaluated, the testing method and the results observed. Most records in the database are from the last decade, and are predominantly from Taiwan, Thailand, the USA and Japan. Trends in the use of various classes of insecticides can easily be followed. Thirty three records have been found of insecticide resistance of more than a thousandfold. An the known mechanisms of resistance are found, and the diamondback moth has become resistant to all the classes of insecticides, including Bacillus thuringiensis but excluding abamectin. Case studies made possible by the use of the database showed a rapid succession in the use of 29 insecticides in the last 26 years in a single country (Thailand). Although this rapid succession is usually ascribed to the development of resistance, a case study on the regional differences in resistance to five insecticides showed marked variations in the level of resistance over distances of 20 miles or more. The possibility of managing insecticide resistance at the local level, already suggested by studies in Hawaii, is thus supported by this analysis. In the second part of this thesis, the toxicity of Bacillus thuringiensis var. aizawai and of the bacterial toxin abamectin was tested by two bioassay techniques on populations of the diamondback moth from two Chinese <b>kale</b> <b>fields</b> at locations in Thailand at which the highest levels of resistance to most insecticides have been reported. The leaf-dip bioassay was found to be superior to a residue-vial assay or to the FAO-recommended assay. More than 70 -fold resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis var. aizawai was observed in the populations of DBM collected from these two fields, suporting the theory that resistance resulted in the control failures reported by growers. Resistance did not explain control failures with abamectin as no resistance to this compound could be detected. The third part of this thesis analyzes the intraplant distribution of the diamondback moth larvae in an effort to explain the control failures with abamectin on Chinese kale. Extensive sampling of the various larval instars of the diamondback moth revealed that a majority of second instar larvae were sheltered on the young folded leaves of Chinese kale. The majority of fourth instar larvae and pupae were found on mature (lower) leaves. Inefficient spraying practices observed in the field with high volume, low pressure hydraulic pump sprayers may allow the young larvae to escape pesticide exposure possibly explaining control failures in the absence of physiological resistance. This study shows that resistance in the diamondback moth is a worldwide problem of major proportions. The rapid development of resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis in the field is of practical concern. Resistance management programs in developing countries should include mechanisms to optimize insecticide delivery to the protected habitats of diamondback moth on Chinese kale...|$|R
