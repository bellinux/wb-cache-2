5|$|Construction {{was to be}} {{completed}} in mid-September 2011 ahead of the October deadline for stimulus funds, but a problem with town permitting in early September delayed the completion of the project. Construction resumed in November. The mini-high platforms, ramps, and new parking spaces opened on February 1, 2013, making the station fully handicapped accessible. <b>Finishing</b> <b>work</b> on platform reconstruction, lighting, and landscaping lasted the spring of 2013, culminating in a reopening ceremony in June.|$|E

40|$|The {{ultimate}} goal of construction is to complete the given work in the most economical and safest way within the required construction period while meeting the quality standards specified in the design drawing. There are a few characteristics of <b>finish</b> <b>work.</b> First, executed in subdivided processes, <b>finish</b> <b>work</b> involves a very diverse and complex structure. Second, there are no criteria for each segmented process {{with regard to the}} appropriate time of input. Third, it is not very necessary to set priorities for lead and lag works. This study intends to provide information on the completion of a project in accordance with the required duration by setting priorities in the delay of each detailed process of <b>finish</b> <b>work</b> to minimize delay in <b>finish</b> <b>work.</b> In this study, <b>finish</b> <b>work</b> is divided into wet work and other types of <b>finish</b> <b>work,</b> and the importance of each process is classified based on the given details of each process. In addition, the study employs a survey to analyze delay factors of a designer, a constructor, and a supplier.

5|$|In 1872, {{architect}} Elijah E. Myers of Springfield, Illinois, {{was commissioned}} {{to design the}} new capitol building and the design committee selected his design named Tuebor, which means I will defend. Myers used the central dome and wing design found in the United States Capitol in his design and subsequently went on to design two other state capitol buildings, the statehouses of Colorado and Texas, {{as well as the}} former territorial capitol building of Idaho, the most by any architect. The cornerstone was laid on October 2, 1873, with about 7,000 Lansing residents and some 30,000 to 50,000 visitors attending. Construction and <b>finishing</b> <b>work</b> were completed by late 1878. The new capitol, with 139 rooms, was dedicated {{at the same time as}} the inauguration of Governor Charles Croswell January 1, 1879.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} inquiry, chaired by Rear Admiral Reinhold von Werner, Monts {{testified that he}} had not been given {{sufficient}} time to familiarize himself with the ship and its crew, who were themselves unfamiliar with the vessel. Monts argued that the mobilization process for the newly commissioned ship should have lasted four to six weeks, rather than the three he had been given. The day before the squadron left Wilhelmshaven, Batsch complained to General Albrecht von Stosch, the chief of the Kaiserliche Marine, that a significant number of dockyard workers were still <b>finishing</b> <b>work</b> on Grosser Kurfürst. Werner and the board determined that Admiral Batsch was at fault and exonerated Monts.|$|E
5|$|The {{genesis of}} the project came in 1998 as Pixar was <b>finishing</b> <b>work</b> on A Bug's Life. At that time Jorgen Klubien began writing a new script called The Yellow Car, about an {{electric}} car living in a gas-guzzling world. Some of the original drawings and characters were produced in 1998 and the producers agreed that Cars {{could be the next}} movie after A Bug's Life and would be released in early 1999, particularly around June 4. However, the movie was eventually scrapped in favor of Toy Story 2. Later, production resumed with major script changes, like giving Mater, Doc, and a few other characters a bigger part.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Finished</b> <b>Work</b> is a {{doctrine}} that locates sanctification {{at the time}} of conversion, afterward the converted Christian progressively grows in grace. This is contrary to the doctrine of entire sanctification that locates complete sanctification in a definite [...] "second work" [...] of grace which is a necessary prerequisite to receive the baptism in the Holy Spirit. The term <b>finished</b> <b>work</b> arises from the aphorism [...] "It's a <b>Finished</b> <b>Work</b> at Calvary", referring to both salvation and sanctification.

After <b>finishing</b> <b>work</b> on Advent Children Complete, the team announced that they would {{take a break from}} the series, although they stated that they still have various ideas for future titles. In later interviews relating to Final Fantasy VII, multiple staff members including Nomura stated that the Compilation was only ever intended to extend to three games and a movie, ending with the release of Crisis Core. Their reasoning was that releasing any more would saturate the market.|$|E
5|$|After <b>finishing</b> <b>work</b> on the Spyro the Dragon series, Insomniac {{originally}} intended to launch a game codenamed I5 (Insomniac game #5) for the PlayStation 2. The developers, however, were never enthusiastic about it, and the idea was dropped after six months. Ratchet & Clank {{was based on an}} idea by Brian Hastings, which would feature a space-traveling reptile alien who would collect various weapons as he progressed through the game; Ratchet's final form was decided upon after Insomniac considered a space lizard with a tail and various terrestrial creatures, including dogs and rats; feline features stood out to the developers because of the associated sense of agility. Another early idea was to have a three small robots attached to Ratchet, which would perform different functions. However, Insomniac realized that having the robots was both complicated and created confusion about Ratchet's appearance, leading them to have only one robot, Clank.|$|E
5|$|After he {{was married}} in December 1933, Cooper {{remained}} faithful to his wife until the summer of 1942, when he began an affair with Ingrid Bergman during the production of For Whom the Bell Tolls. Their relationship lasted through the completion of filming Saratoga Trunk in June 1943. In 1948, after <b>finishing</b> <b>work</b> on The Fountainhead, Cooper began an affair with actress Patricia Neal, his co-star. At first they kept their affair discreet, but eventually it became an open secret in Hollywood, and Cooper's wife confronted him with the rumors, which he admitted were true. He also confessed {{that he was in}} love with Neal, and continued to see her. Cooper and his wife were legally separated in May 1951, but he did not seek a divorce. Neal later claimed that Cooper hit her after she went on a date with Kirk Douglas, and that he arranged for her to have an abortion when she became pregnant with Cooper's child. Neal ended their relationship in late December 1951. During his three-year separation from his wife, Cooper was rumored to have had affairs with Grace Kelly, Lorraine Chanel, and Gisèle Pascal.|$|E

25|$|With {{the success}} of the Captain America character, Simon said he felt that Goodman was not paying the pair the promised {{percentage}} of profits, and so sought work {{for the two of them}} at National Comics Publications (later renamed DC Comics). Kirby and Simon negotiated a deal that would pay them a combined $500 a week, as opposed to the $75 and $85 they respectively earned at Timely. The pair feared Goodman would not pay them if he found they were moving to National, but many people knew of their plan, including Timely editorial assistant, Stan Lee. When Goodman eventually discovered it, he told Simon and Kirby to leave after <b>finishing</b> <b>work</b> on Captain America Comics #10.|$|E
25|$|The best-known {{version of}} the grand-ducal coat of arms is found on the tomb of Gustavus I (1523–60) in the Uppsala cathedral (Figure 5). It has been {{suggested}} that either Duke John himself, or his brother Eric XIV, was leading the design work on the heraldic signs on the tomb. Neither statement can be confirmed, but it is known that Eric XIV showed an interest in heraldry. The monument was commissioned from Guillaume Boyen (Willem Boy), a Flemish architect and sculptor who had worked in Sweden. He started on the task in Antwerp in 1562, completing it 10 years later; however, the tomb was not in place in Uppsala until the early 1580s, and the <b>finishing</b> <b>work</b> lasted until 1591. In addition to the royal arms of Sweden and those of Finland, the arms of the 11 provinces are depicted. From Finland they include North and South Finland, as well as Tavastia and Karelia. The work of Willem Boy is of exceptional quality, which is perhaps {{explained by the fact that}} lions were a dominant feature in the heraldry of Flanders, and he would therefore have had a great deal of exposure to it before receiving the commission for the tomb of Gustavus I.|$|E
