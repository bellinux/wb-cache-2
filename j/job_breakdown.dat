5000|$|Job Methods (JM) - {{a course}} that taught workers to objectively {{evaluate}} the efficiency of their jobs and to methodically evaluate and suggest improvements. The course also worked with a <b>job</b> <b>breakdown,</b> but students were taught to analyze each step and determine if there were sufficient reason {{to continue to do}} it in that way by asking a series of pointed questions. If they determined some step could be done better by eliminating, combining, rearranging, or simplifying, they were to develop and apply the new method by selling it to the [...] "boss" [...] and co-workers, obtaining approval based on safety, quality, quantity, and cost, standardizing the new method, and giving credit.|$|E
40|$|Background This paper {{focuses on}} the {{transition}} to supported employment for people with intellectual disabilities paying {{particular attention to the}} impact of <b>job</b> <b>breakdown</b> on psychological well-being; an issue often omitted from studies. Materials and Methods Forty-nine people with intellectual disabilities were interviewed within 3 months of entering supported employment and 9 - 12 months later. Data collection involved in-depth interviews with people with intellectual disabilities, their carers and employers and completion of a self-report measure of depression and anxiety (an adapted form of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and a self-report measure of quality of life (the ComQol). Results By time of the follow-up interviews, 13 of the 49 jobs had broken down. Analysis of scores measuring quality of life, anxiety and depression showed no effect for loss of employment. However, interviews with participants indicated that job loss had a considerable impact on those affected. Conclusions There were a wide range of reasons for <b>job</b> <b>breakdown,</b> many of which were particular to the circumstances of people with intellectual disabilities. Although <b>job</b> <b>breakdown</b> does not have an impact of anxiety or depression many participants found job loss traumati...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT – Reports have {{highlighted}} {{a shortage of}} con-sultant diabetologist posts in the UK. The number of doctors completing specialist training in diabetes has increased in recent years, but {{little is known about}} their employment after they receive their certificate of completion of training. An online survey was sent to all doctors who completed specialist diabetes training from January 2008 to September 2010. Of the 95 eligible respondents, 69 (73 %) completed the survey (61 % men; median age 36 years). Forty-three (62 %) respond-ents secured substantive NHS consultant posts, and of those who gave their <b>job</b> <b>breakdown,</b> 48 / 51 (94 %) were contributing to specialist diabetes care. Five (7 %) respondents held substan-tive academic positions, while 11 (16 %) were locum consult-ants. Seven (9 %) respondents worked abroad, with half of these attributing their emigration to lack of opportunities in the UK. When asked about alternative choices, 39 % of respond-ents were likely to seek ‘general physician ’ roles, which equalled the number who would consider emigrating. Overall, only two-thirds of doctors who complete specialist training in diabetes secure substantive NHS consultant positions, which suggests a failure in workforce planning and a lack of expan-sion of the number of consultant posts despite progression of the diabetes epidemic.

50|$|A {{job safety}} {{analysis}} (JSA) is a procedure which helps integrate accepted safety and health principles and practices into a particular task or job operation. In a JSA, each basic step of the job is to identify potential hazards and to recommend the safest way to do the job. Other terms used to describe this procedure are job hazard analysis (JHA) and <b>job</b> hazard <b>breakdown.</b>|$|R
30|$|Production {{scheduling}} has {{a number}} of challenges. For example, production environments are dynamic and uncertain (e.g. job arrivals, <b>job</b> cancellations, machine <b>breakdowns),</b> which cause computational difficulties for most optimisation techniques. The complexity of the production systems caused by heterogeneous production processes (e.g. batching, sequence-dependent setup times, assembly) also makes scheduling tasks particularly hard. Moreover, production scheduling has to take into account multiple conflicting objectives to ensure that the obtained schedules are approved and applicable.|$|R
30|$|Dynamic {{changes are}} {{unavoidable}} in the real-world applications and coping {{with this issue}} is essential. Traditional optimisation methods could not handle dynamic change well. Fortunately, scheduling heuristics evolved by GP can cope very well with the dynamic changes. Basically, these heuristics can deal easily with most dynamic changes such as dynamic <b>job</b> arrivals, machine <b>breakdowns,</b> and stochastic processing times. However, {{to improve the quality}} as well as the robustness of evolved heuristics, the problem domain knowledge is needed. Either the knowledge is provided to GP by the researchers or automatically extracted from the environment will need further investigation.|$|R
50|$|According to a Korean study {{into the}} disorder, {{pathological}} {{use of the}} internet results in negative life consequences such as <b>job</b> loss, marriage <b>breakdown,</b> financial debt, and academic failure. 70% of internet users in Korea are reported to play online games, 18% of which are diagnosed as game addicts. The authors of the article conducted a study using Kimberly Young's questionnaire. The study showed that the majority of those who met the requirements of internet addiction disorder suffered from interpersonal difficulties and stress and that those addicted to online games specifically responded that they hoped to avoid reality.|$|R
40|$|The risk {{of poverty}} is very {{unevenly}} distributed in society. Some groups – unemployed people, lone parents, large families, people with disabilities, and some ethnic groups – have much higher poverty rates than average. Some events – losing a <b>job,</b> marital <b>breakdown,</b> having children – also put people {{at high risk}} of poverty. But being in a high-risk group does not necessarily mean you will be poor, nor does experiencing an event with a high poverty risk attached to it. Some people avoid poverty, despite being in high-risk groups or facing high-risk events. This article focuses on one such group – low-paid workers – and explores whether and how people in low-paid jobs are able to avoid poverty. We consider three main options – own wages and in particular working long hours, living with other people and sharing income, and state transfers through the tax and benefit system – and compare these across different family and household types. The results highlight the importance of household living arrangements in protecting low-waged individuals against poverty...|$|R
40|$|Within the pede project we {{investigate}} the generation {{and execution of}} plans in distributed environments. Multiple, communicating agents perform tasks like generating process plans and machine schedules and controlling their execution. A general problem in such environments is how to handle unexpected events like high priority <b>jobs</b> and machine <b>breakdowns.</b> A cooperative approach, where agents communicate in order to resolve occurring problems, usually leads to superior overall performance, but is bought {{at the price of}} increased network traffic and more complex agent architectures. We argue that the application of distributed reason maintenance techniques yields simpler agents and structured communication. We present darms, a distributed reason maintenance system, and show how it can be applied to integrate planning, scheduling, and control.

40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the {{calculation}} of the stability radius of an optimal schedule for a job shop problem, when the objective is to minimize mean or maximum flow times. The approach used may be regarded as an a posteriori analysis, in which an optimal schedule has already been constructed and the question is to determine such changes in the processing times of operations as do not destroy the optimality of the schedule at hand. More precisely, the stability radius denotes the largest quantity of independent variations of the processing times of the operations such that an optimal schedule of the problem remains optimal. Although in scheduling theory mainly deterministic problems are considered and the processing times are supposed to be given in advance, such scheduling problems do not often arise in practice. Even if the processing times are know before applying a scheduling procedure, OR workers are forced to take into account possible changes and errors within the practical realization of a schedule, e. g. additionally arriving <b>jobs,</b> machine <b>breakdowns,</b> the precision of equipment which is used to calculate the processing times, and so on. In other words, usually in practice a schedule has to be realized under conditions of uncertainty. This paper investigates the influence of errors and possible changes of the processing times on the optimality of a schedule. To this end, extensive numerical experiments with randomly generated job shop scheduling problems are performed and discussed. The developed software provides the possibility of comparing the values of the stability radii, the numbers of optimal schedules and some other "numbers" for two often used criteria. The main question we try to answer is how large the stability radius is, on average, for randomly generated job shop problems. job shop scheduling graph stability simulation...|$|R
5000|$|Manager Graham Evans {{resigned}} shortly afterwards, {{three months}} into the <b>job,</b> citing a <b>breakdown</b> in relations with the Chairman. Head Coach Benji Evans took charge as caretaker Manager, {{before the arrival of}} Guilsfield boss, Mike Barton, took over the reins. However, just a month into his reign, he too quit the club. A further three points were deducted for the club failing to fulfill the fixture at Penrhyncoch. Benji Evans again took charge in a Caretaker capacity [...] before the club recruited Connah's Quay striker Chris Herbert moved to the club for his first job in management, as player manager. Over the remaining months of the season, Herbert and Evans completely restructured the playing squad, bringing in various quality and experienced players and results improved dramatically. Their efforts weren't good enough to prevent the club's second successive relegation, and the massive points deficit was too great, but they did get back into positive points {{before the end of the}} season. However, on the final day of the season, away at Rhyl FC, a suspended John Keegan appeared in the starting line-up and the club forfeited another three points, ending the campaign rock bottom on zero points.|$|R
