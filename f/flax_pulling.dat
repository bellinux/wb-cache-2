50|$|Hemp {{gathering}} songs {{closely resemble}} <b>flax</b> <b>pulling</b> songs.|$|E
50|$|Many {{songs are}} {{associated}} with pulling flax and communal flax breaking. <b>Flax</b> <b>pulling</b> songs reflect the cycle of tasks of cultivating and harvesting the flax. Linen objects are referred to affectionately. In some songs the images of growing and working the flax are seen through the relationship of a boy and his girl. Humorous <b>flax</b> <b>pulling</b> songs make fun of idlers.|$|E
40|$|The {{cultivation}} of linseed {{is an alternative}} to the production of flax stem, which is globally on the decline. The alternative method to the traditional harvest using the <b>flax</b> <b>puller</b> is increasing use of combine harvester. By this method the harvest efficiency will be increased, which represents a significant step to an improvement of economy of cultivation. Depending on the variety, the value of specific energy consumption was determined from (0. 43 MJ/kg) up to (0. 63 MJ/kg) if we use <b>flax</b> <b>puller</b> and from (0. 58 MJ/kg) up to (0. 86 MJ/kg) if it is used a combine harvester. Levelized costs for seed production in case of soil cultivaton with tillage rangein wide interval (9, 714 CZK/t – 17, 308 CZK/t) depending on yield of a variety and used machinery...|$|R

40|$|The District Almanac {{was created}} in the Fall of 2012 by the Studio II class of the Art and the Book Masters Program at at the Corcoran College of Art and Design, under the {{guidance}} of Sarah McDermott. The book cames as a response to noticeable shifts in human, animal, and plant cycles in our adopted habitat of Washington D. C. using data collected by personal exploration of our surroundings.

50|$|<b>Flax</b> is <b>pulled</b> out of {{the ground}} about a month after the initial {{blooming}} when {{the lower part of the}} plant begins to turn yellow, and when the most forward of the seeds are found in a soft state. It is pulled in handfuls and several handfuls are tied together with slip knot into a 'beet'. The string is tightened as the stalks dry. The seed heads are removed and the seeds collected, by threshing and winnowing.|$|R
5000|$|Oat harvesting, <b>flax</b> and {{buckwheat}} <b>pulling</b> and hemp gathering songs. Oat harvesting songs sing of the lad and the maid, of {{love and}} marriage {{as well as the}} work process: sowing, harrowing, cultivating, reaping, binding, stacking, transporting, threshing, milling, and even eating. In addition to the monophonic oat harvesting songs of Dzūkija, {{there are quite a few}} sutartinės from northern Aukštaitija, which are directly related to the job of growing oats.|$|R
40|$|In some late years {{a number}} of fibre flax {{varieties}} and new breeding lines have been created and investigated at the Upytė Research Station of Lithuanian Institute of Agriculture (LIA). The fibre quality parameters of the new varieties of fibre flax are studied and {{compared with those of}} standard flax varieties. <b>Flax</b> was <b>pulled</b> at the stage of early yellow ripeness, warm water-retted, threshed, scutched and hackled. Long fibre content was calculated from the dry mass of unretted straw. Fibre quality’s parameters of some flax varieties (“Belinka ” (standard), “Baltučiai”, “Ariane”) and new breeding lines (No. 01057 - 12, No. 1698 - 13 a, No. 1864 - 24, No. 1963 - 3) grown in 2001 – 2003 are investigated. The main properties of flax fibre as fineness, flexibility, and tensile strength are measured, and the data obtained by common methods and some new modern methods are compared. The flax varieties producing the fibre of higher qualities are revealed...|$|R
