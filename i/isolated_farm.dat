5|$|Having {{begun to}} push back the feeble French forces from Marmont's VI's Corps the day before, Blücher {{occupied}} Champaubert early on 14 February, sending his vanguard forward, {{as far as the}} village of Fromentières and then Vauchamps. Marmont, commanding only the Lagrange division and 800 men from the Ricard division, had cautiously pulled his men back towards Montmirail, where he began to receive reinforcements. Towards 9 o'clock in the morning, Blücher set Zieten's brigade and some cavalry in motion from Vauchamps towards Montmirail. To their surprise, Marmont's men didn't give ground this time and vigorously counterattacked, pushing Zieten's advance guard back into the village of Vauchamps. The accompanying Prussian cavalry was dispersed by a violent French cannonade. With now both brigades of Ricard's division available, Marmont launched these men against the Prussian position at Vauchamps, with the 1st brigade on his right, advancing under the cover of the Beaumont forest, south of the Montmirail-Vauchamps road and the 2nd brigade on his left, north of the road, advancing frontally towards the position. Marmont also had with him his own escort cavalry squadron and four élite Imperial Guard duty squadrons from the Emperor's own escort, under general Lion. Marmont's leftmost brigade entered Vauchamps, but, with the village heavily invested with Zieten's Prussian defenders, the Frenchmen were soon repulsed, with the Prussians in pursuit. Marshal Marmont then launched his five squadrons to the rescue and the cavalry promptly forced the Prussians back to the village, with one of their battalions taken prisoner, after taking refuge in an <b>isolated</b> <b>farm.</b>|$|E

25|$|A {{building}} boom in South Brooklyn started in about 1902 and 1903. Thousands of people started {{coming to the}} area from Manhattan and from other places. In 1905 and 1906 realty values increased by about 100 percent, and land values increased. This growth was spurred {{by the promise of}} improved transportation access. The improved transportation access transformed the community from an <b>isolated</b> <b>farm</b> community to a center of industrial and commercial life.|$|E

25|$|However, Yavapai recalcitrants {{remained}} for years, and raids on stage-coaches, <b>isolated</b> <b>farm</b> houses, and periodic raids on villages kept {{the area in}} a constant state of tension. Finally, following several murders of Yavapai chiefs allied with America by insurgent Yavapai warriors, hostile warrior tribal leaders mobilized the entire Yavapai warrior band into a massive assault on the primary American settlement of Wickenburg and massacred or drove out much of the American populace.|$|E
500|$|In 2014, a party called [...] "Project P" [...] {{was thrown}} in Mecosta County, Michigan which {{attracted}} more that 2,000 people to an <b>isolated</b> <b>farm</b> house. There were go-go dancers, strippers, a fire thrower and two DJs reportedly hired for the party. Dozens of participants {{were taken to}} area hospitals after overdosing on drugs (particularly heroin) and alcohol including one reported sexual assault. Police from seven agencies who responded chose to manage the situation from the perimeter {{because of the risk}} of hundreds of intoxicated drivers fleeing the scene. Three suspected organizers of the rave were formally charged.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the next}} century the Vikings of York and the north became {{gradually}} Christianized, and Cuthbert's shrine became a focus of devotion among them also. [...] The community established close relations with Guthred (d. 895), Halfdene's successor as king, and received land from him at Chester-le-Street. [...] In 883 they moved the few miles there, where they stayed over a century, building St Cuthbert's Church, where Cuthbert's shrine was placed. [...] In 995 a new Danish invasion led the community to flee some 50 miles south to Ripon, again taking the coffin with them. [...] After {{three or four months}} it was felt safe to return, and the party had nearly reached Chester-le-Street when their wagon became definitively stuck close to Durham, then a place with cultivated fields, but hardly a settlement, perhaps just an <b>isolated</b> <b>farm.</b> [...] It was thought that Cuthbert was expressing a wish to settle where he was, and the community obeyed. [...] A new stone church—the so-called White Church—was built, the predecessor of the present Durham Cathedral.|$|E

2500|$|Marella {{originally}} billed {{himself as}} Gino Marella, a proud Italian American babyface who would sing in Italian {{prior to his}} matches. Even after changing his ring name, [...] "Gino" [...] stuck as Marella's nickname among friends and colleagues, including Jesse Ventura, who would call Marella [...] "Gino" [...] on the air. Marella garnered moderate popularity, but soon realized that fans {{paid more attention to}} outlandish monster heel gimmicks, and they therefore made more money. Marella totally revamped his image, growing a long beard and billing himself as Gorilla Monsoon, a terrifying giant from Manchuria. Supposedly born on an <b>isolated</b> <b>farm,</b> [...] "Monsoon" [...] traveled across the countryside with a gypsy caravan wrestling bears, spoke no English, ate raw meat, and drank his victims' blood. The story given on WWWF television was a bit different: his first manager, Bobby Davis, claimed to have discovered Monsoon in Manchuria wading nude in a mountain stream. The Monsoon character was far more successful, and fans were genuinely afraid of him, sparking a huge financial windfall for Marella. In the ring, Monsoon dominated opponents with vicious chops, the dreaded Manchurian Splash, and his signature move, the Airplane Spin.|$|E
60|$|They {{filled a}} little sack {{at my side}} with Zodangan money. The medium of {{exchange}} upon Mars is not dissimilar from our own except that the coins are oval. Paper money is issued by individuals as they require it and redeemed twice yearly. If a man issues more than he can redeem, the government pays his creditors in full and the debtor works out the amount upon the farms or in mines, which are all owned by the government. This suits everybody except the debtor {{as it has been}} a difficult thing to obtain sufficient voluntary labor to work the great <b>isolated</b> <b>farm</b> lands of Mars, stretching as they do like narrow ribbons from pole to pole, through wild stretches peopled by wild animals and wilder men.|$|E
60|$|Amid {{many small}} drives and many skirmishes, one stands out for its severity. It is {{remarkable}} {{as being the}} last action of any importance in the campaign. This was the fight at Moolman's Spruit, near Ficksburg, upon April 20th, 1902. A force of about one hundred Yeomanry and forty Mounted Infantry (South Staffords) was despatched by night to attack an <b>isolated</b> <b>farm</b> in which a small body of Boers {{was supposed to be}} sleeping. Colonel Perceval was in command. The farm was reached after a difficult march, but the enemy were found to have been forewarned, and to be in much greater strength than was anticipated. A furious fire was opened on the advancing troops, who were clearly visible in the light of a full moon. Sir Thomas Fowler was killed and several men of the Yeomanry were hit. The British charged up to the very walls, but were unable to effect an entrance, as the place was barricaded and loopholed. Captain Blackwood, of the Staffords, was killed in the attack. Finding that the place was impregnable, and that the enemy outnumbered him, Colonel Perceval gave the order to retire, a movement which was only successfully carried out because the greater part of the Boer horses had been shot. By morning the small British force had extricated itself, from its perilous position with a total loss of six killed, nineteen wounded, and six missing. The whole affair was undoubtedly a cleverly planned Boer ambush, and the small force was most fortunate in escaping destruction.|$|E
