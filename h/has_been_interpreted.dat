5|$|The myth of Myrrha <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>interpreted</b> {{in various}} ways. The {{transformation}} of Myrrha in Ovid's version <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>interpreted</b> as a punishment for her breaking the social rules through her incestuous {{relationship with her}} father. Like Byblis who {{fell in love with}} her brother, Myrrha is transformed and rendered voiceless making her unable to break the taboo of incest.|$|E
5|$|The mid-11th century Gosforth Cross {{located in}} Cumbria, England, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>interpreted</b> as {{featuring}} various figures from Norse mythology. The bottom {{portion of the}} west side of the cross features a depiction of a long-haired female, kneeling figure holding an object above another prostrate, bound figure. Above and to their left is a knotted serpent. This <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>interpreted</b> as Sigyn soothing the bound Loki.|$|E
5|$|Another {{formation}} with tyrannosaur {{remains is}} the Lance Formation of Wyoming. This <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>interpreted</b> as a bayou environment similar to today's Gulf Coast. The fauna {{was very similar}} to Hell Creek, but with Struthiomimus replacing its relative Ornithomimus. The small ceratopsian Leptoceratops also lived in the area.|$|E
25|$|Above {{the cave}} {{are a number}} of stylized objects which <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>interpreted</b> as rain clouds, with exclamation-like objects ("!") {{appearing}} to fall from them. These <b>have</b> <b>been</b> generally <b>interpreted</b> as raindrops.|$|R

5|$|Early {{comic strips}} also avoided overt {{treatment}} of gay issues, though examples of homosexual subtext have been identified. The 1938–1939 edition of Milton Caniff's Terry and the Pirates features a primary villain, Sanjak, who <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>interpreted</b> {{by some as}} a lesbian with designs on the hero's girlfriend.|$|E
5|$|Oleg's death <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>interpreted</b> as a {{distorted}} {{variant of the}} threefold death theme in Indo-European myth and legend, with prophecy, the snake and the horse representing the three functions: the prophecy is associated with sovereignty, the horse with warriors, and the serpent with reproduction.|$|E
5|$|The {{recognition}} of Beonna {{as a historical}} figure leaves the 'Hun' element in the word Hunbeanna detached. Beanna is itself a hypocoristic form of a two-part name, and the 'nn' in the name <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>interpreted</b> as representing a geminate consonant.|$|E

5|$|The suffix is {{sometimes}} missing, which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>interpreted</b> as a zero suffix. Words with zero suffix are termed root verbs and root nouns. Beyond this basic structure, {{there is the}} nasal infix, a present tense marker, and reduplication, a sort of prefix {{with a number of}} grammatical and derivational functions.|$|E
5|$|Tianyulong from China {{appears to}} {{preserve}} filamentous integument which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>interpreted</b> to be {{a variant of}} the proto-feathers found in some theropods. These filaments include a crest along its tail. The presence of this filamentous integument has been used to suggest that both ornithischians and saurischians were endothermic.|$|E
5|$|Typically, Othnielosaurus <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>interpreted</b> {{like other}} hypsilophodonts as a small, swift herbivore, {{although}} Bakker (1986) interpreted the possibly related Nanosaurus as an omnivore. This idea {{has had some}} unofficial support, but little in the formal literature; description of more complete skull remains {{will be needed to}} test this hypothesis.|$|E

5|$|Vendel era helmet plates (from the 6th or 7th century) {{found in}} a grave in Sweden depict a helmeted figure holding a spear and a shield while riding a horse, flanked by two birds. The plate <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>interpreted</b> as Odin {{accompanied}} by two birds: his ravens.|$|E
5|$|An epigraphic {{reference}} {{ascribed to}} Garulaka Simhaditya, {{the son of}} Varahdas, the king of Dwarka, is inscribed on a copper plate dated to 574AD, found in Palitana. The Greek writer of the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea referred to a place called Baraca, which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>interpreted</b> as present-day Dwarka. A reference made in Ptolemy's Geography identified Barake as {{an island in the}} Gulf of Kanthils, which has also been inferred to mean Dwarka.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} has been found of Neolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Age settlements in the area, and Chatteris possesses what <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>interpreted</b> as the only upstanding Neolithic boundaries in Fenland. Saxon evidence is less well preserved, although in 679, Hunna, the chaplain to Æthelthryth of Ely built a hermitage on Honey Hill. More apocryphically, Chatteris is reputed {{to have been the}} last refuge of Boudica as she fled from the Romans.|$|E

5|$|Dhumavati {{is always}} {{considered}} a widow, and thus, {{is the only}} Mahavidya without a consort. Though associated with Shiva, having eaten him, he has since left her. Having destroyed the male element (Purusha) in the universe, she is left with nothing, but she is still Shakti, the female element with latent energy. Dhumavati's insatiable hunger and thirst is highlighted in many texts, and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>interpreted</b> as the manifestation of her unsatisfied desires.|$|E
5|$|The Tjängvide image stone {{from the}} Baltic island of Gotland, Sweden {{features}} a rider on an eight-legged horse, {{which may be}} Odin's eight-legged horse Sleipnir, being greeted by a female, which may be a valkyrie at Valhalla. The 11th century runestone U 1163 features a carving of a female bearing a horn that <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>interpreted</b> as the valkyrie Sigrdrífa handing the hero Sigurd (also depicted on the stone) a drinking horn.|$|E
5|$|The amendment's {{first section}} {{includes}} several clauses: the Citizenship Clause, Privileges or Immunities Clause, Due Process Clause, and Equal Protection Clause. The Citizenship Clause provides a broad definition of citizenship, nullifying the Supreme Court's decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), which had held that Americans descended from African slaves {{could not be}} citizens of the United States. The Privileges or Immunities Clause <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>interpreted</b> {{in such a way}} that it does very little.|$|E

5|$|The exact {{appearance}} of the icon is unclear: although the early image <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>interpreted</b> as a bust of the Christ Pantocrator type, late Byzantine references, such as coins by John III Vatatzes (r. 1221–1254) and the Deesis mosaic in the Chora Church, use the term for depictions of a standing Christ on a pedestal.|$|E
5|$|The {{filaments}} exhibit random {{orientations and}} are often wavy, which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>interpreted</b> as evidence that they were soft and pliable in life. Microscopic examination shows that individual filaments appear dark along the edges and light internally, suggesting that they were hollow, like modern feathers. Compared to modern mammals the filaments were quite coarse, with each individual strand much larger and thicker than the corresponding hairs of similarly sized mammals.|$|E
5|$|The section <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>interpreted</b> by Canadian writers, {{who have}} {{analyzed}} both its intention and its meaning. Because the section affirms {{the name of}} the Charter and thus entrenches it in the Constitution Act, it came into focus in 1994 when a Member of Parliament (MP) proposed to change {{the name of the}} Charter.|$|E
