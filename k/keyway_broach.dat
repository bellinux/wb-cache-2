40|$|In this paper, we {{presents}} the results of investigations studied the cutting ability and grindability of selected high-speed steels. We analysed the effect of the austenitization temperature on the grain size, the amount of retained austenite and percentage of retained austenite in HS 3 - 1 - 1 steel. Furthermore, the investigations concerned on the efficiency of the <b>keyway</b> <b>broaches</b> during the whole period of operation were carried out. It was found that the value of average roughness parameter increases together with increases in the grinding depth. The investigations also show the influence of tempering conditions on the volume of carbide phases in HS 3 - 1 - 1 steel...|$|R
40|$|Broaching tool cuts keyslots in tapped holes. With {{exceptionally}} slim outer body, {{well suited}} for work in areas of limited accessibility, particularly when features of workpiece create obstructions. Threaded sections on inner and outer bodies mate. After inner body used to <b>broach</b> <b>keyways</b> in hole in workpiece, turning outer body by its handle forces bearing surface against workpiece and pulls inner body tip out of hole. Reduces time for broaching holes from 4 h to 1 h. Blade replaced only twice per circle...|$|R
50|$|Broaching is {{primarily}} used to cut square cornered internal <b>keyways.</b> The specific <b>broach,</b> bushing and guide {{are used for}} each given keyway cross-section, which makes this process more expensive {{than most of the}} alternatives. However, it can produce the most accurate keyway out of all the processes. There are three main steps in broaching a keyway: First, the workpiece is set on the arbor press and the bushing is placed in the opening of the workpiece. Next, the broach is inserted and pushed through, cutting the keyway. Finally, shims are placed between the bushing and the broach to achieve the correct depth necessary for the key.|$|R
