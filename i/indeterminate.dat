5|$|Fish, {{which may}} have been preyed upon by smaller crocodilians, are {{represented}} by teeth and scales. They include a myliobatiform ray referred to the genus Baibisha; an <b>indeterminate</b> member of the Neopterygii; a semionotid referred to the genus Lepidotes; a gar related to Atractosteus; a pycnodontid referred to the genus Stephanodus; and an <b>indeterminate</b> bowfin. <b>Indeterminate</b> caudatans (salamanders) and mammals are also present. As for plants, pollen samples indicate a tiered forest surrounding the lakes of the Mussentuchit, containing a canopy of tree ferns, araucarias, and conifers, accompanying an undergrowth of ferns, small gymnosperms, and flowering plants. Algae would also have been present in the waters of the lakes. These plants would have provided an abundant source of food for Eolambia.|$|E
5|$|In 1901 Baron Franz Nopcsa renamed Laelaps trihedrodon Cope 1877 into Megalosaurus trihedrodon. In {{the same}} {{publication}} Nopcsa renamed Poekilopleuron valens Leidy 1870 into Megalosaurus valens; this probably represents fossil material of Allosaurus. In 1902, Nopcsa named Megalosaurus hungaricus {{based on two}} teeth found in Transylvania, then part of the Kingdom of Hungary. The specimens, MAFI ob. 3106, were later lost. It represents an <b>indeterminate</b> theropod. In 1903, Louis Dollo named Megalosaurus lonzeensis based on a manual claw found near Lonzee in Belgium. He had first reported this claw in 1883, {{and as a result}} some sources by mistake indicate this year as the date of the naming. It perhaps represents a member of the Noasauridae, or an <b>indeterminate</b> member of the Coelurosauria. In 1907/1908, von Huene renamed Streptospondylus cuvieri Owen 1842, based on a presently lost partial vertebra, into Megalosaurus cuvieri. This is today seen as a nomen dubium, an <b>indeterminate</b> member of the Tetanurae. In 1909, Richard Lydekker named Megalosaurus woodwardi, based on a maxilla with tooth, specimen BMNH 41352. This is today seen as a nomen dubium, an <b>indeterminate</b> member of the Theropoda.|$|E
2500|$|... can {{be taken}} as the {{definition}} of an elementary symmetric function {{if the number of}} <b>indeterminates</b> is infinite, or as the definition of an elementary symmetric polynomial in any finite number of <b>indeterminates.</b> Symmetric polynomials for the same symmetric function should be compatible with the morphisms n (decreasing the number of <b>indeterminates</b> is obtained by setting some of them to zero, so that the coefficients of any monomial in the remaining <b>indeterminates</b> is unchanged), and their degree should remain bounded. (An example of a family of symmetric polynomials that fails both conditions is the family [...] fails only the second condition.) Any symmetric polynomial in n <b>indeterminates</b> can be used to construct a compatible family of symmetric polynomials, using the morphisms i for i<n to decrease the number of <b>indeterminates,</b> and i for i'n {{to increase the number of}} <b>indeterminates</b> (which amounts to adding all monomials in new <b>indeterminates</b> obtained by symmetry from monomials already present).|$|R
50|$|One slight {{generalization}} of polynomial rings {{is to allow}} for infinitely many <b>indeterminates.</b> Each monomial still involves only {{a finite number of}} <b>indeterminates</b> (so that its degree remains finite), and each polynomial is a still a (finite) linear combination of monomials.
