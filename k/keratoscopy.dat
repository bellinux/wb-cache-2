50|$|The {{three-dimensional}} map {{is therefore}} a valuable aid to the examining ophthalmologist or optometrist and can assist in the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} a number of conditions; in planning cataract surgery and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation (plano or toric IOLs); in planning refractive surgery such as LASIK, and evaluating its results; or in assessing the fit of contact lenses. A development of <b>keratoscopy,</b> corneal topography extends the measurement range from the four points a few millimeters apart that is offered by keratometry to a grid of thousands of points covering the entire cornea. The procedure is carried out in seconds and is completely painless.|$|E

Methods: This retrospective study included 35 eyes of 34 patients with progressive keratoconus who underwent CXL. Topographical measurements were obtained preoperatively and in the first, third, and sixth months postoperatively using a rotating Scheimpflug camera. The uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), flat keratometry (K) value (K 1), steep K value (K 2), average K value (avgK), topographic cylindrical value (Cyl), apical <b>keratoscopy</b> front (AKf), apical <b>keratoscopy</b> back (AKb), symmetry index front (SIf), symmetry index back (SIb), and thinnest point of the cornea (ThkMin) were recorded. Results: At the 6 -month follow-up, the mean UCVA and BCVA values were improved, and the K values remained stable. Statistically significant decreases in AKf (p= 0. 04) and the thinnest point of the cornea (p= 0. 001) and a statistically significant increase in AKb (p= 0. 01) were observed. A correlation analysis revealed that the preoperative BCVA, UCVA, K 1, K 2, avgK, AKf, and AKb values significantly affected visual acuity at the 6 -month follow-up. Conclusions: Accelerated CXL is an effective treatment for the prevention or even reversal of keratoconus progression. The preoperative K values and apexes of the anterior and posterior cornea were found to affect visual acuity at 6 months after accelerated CXL. Both AKb steepening and AKf flattening appear to be important factors in the stabilization of keratometric values and improvement of visual outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Diagnostics of the {{anterior}} {{segment of the}} eye present the most frequent diagnostics implemented in ophthalmology and by most veterinary practicians as well. This paper presents the complete diagnostics in the most concise form possible. The procedure with animals is presented first, followed by the equipment, and then anamnesis. The following diagnostic methods are presented: examination in a lighted room which include an examination from a distance, taking a smear, the Schirmer tear test (STT), an examination from close by, examination {{in a dark room}} which comprises the elementary examinations, {{such as the use of}} focal lighting and examination using a direct ophthalmoscope, and special examination in a dark room, such as biomicroscopy, gonioscopy and <b>keratoscopy.</b> Additional examination methods are also included...|$|E
