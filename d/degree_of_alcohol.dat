40|$|Acetaldehyde, {{the toxic}} product of ethanol {{metabolism}} in the liver, covalently binds {{to a variety}} of proteins. Recent studies indicate that such binding can stimulate the production of antibodies against the acetaldehyde adducts. We raised rabbit antibodies which recognized various protein-acetaldehyde conjugates but not the corresponding control proteins. Such antibodies were used in immunohistochemical studies to find out whether acetaldehyde-generated epitopes can be detected from liver specimens of 13 human subjects with different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> consumption. While the specimens obtained from alcohol abusers (n = 4) and alcoholics (n = 3) exhibited marked positive staining for acetaldehyde adducts inside the hepatocytes in a granular uneven pattern, the control samples (n = 6) were almost devoid of immunoreactivity. In the alcohol abusers with an early stage of alcohol-induced liver damage, staining was detected exclusively around the central veins. The data indicate that intracellular acetaldehyde adducts occur in the centrilobular region of the liver of individuals consuming excessive amounts <b>of</b> <b>alcohol.</b> Immunohistochemical detection <b>of</b> such adducts may prove to be of value in the early identification <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> abuse and in elucidating the mechanisms of alcohol-induced organ damage...|$|R

In response to strong community support, the Australian Government will continue funding of night patrols. In addition, the funding will support the Northern Territory Child Abuse Taskforce. Furthermore, the Stronger Futures policy includes 76 million dollars in funding to tackle alcohol abuse in terms of extending current restrictions, developing alcohol management plans and increasing penalties for grog running.

Less clear is how regional brain tissue reductions differ after normalizing for brain size differences linked with FASD and whether these profiles can predict the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> prenatal exposure to alcohol. To examine associations of regional brain tissue excesses/deficits with <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> prenatal <b>alcohol</b> exposure and diagnosis {{with and without}} correction for overall brain volume, tensor-based morphometry (TBM) methods were applied to structural imaging data from a well-characterized, demographically homogeneous sample of children diagnosed with FASD (n =  39, 9. 6 – 11. 0  years) and controls (n =  16, 9. 5 – 11. 0  years). <b>Degree</b> <b>of</b> prenatal <b>alcohol</b> exposure {{was significantly associated with}} regionally pervasive brain tissue reductions in: (1) the thalamus, midbrain, and ventromedial frontal lobe, (2) the superior cerebellum and inferior occipital lobe, (3) the dorsolateral frontal cortex, and (4) the precuneus and superior parietal lobule. When overall brain size was factored out of the analysis on a subject-by-subject basis, no regions showed significant associations with alcohol exposure. FASD diagnosis was associated with a similar deformation pattern, but few of the regions survived FDR correction. In data-driven independent component analyses (ICA) regional brain tissue deformations successfully distinguished individuals based on extent <b>of</b> prenatal <b>alcohol</b> exposure and to a lesser degree, diagnosis. The greater sensitivity of the continuous measure <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> exposure compared with the categorical diagnosis across diverse brain regions underscores the dose dependence of these effects.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the potential of}} fostering the sensory and psychological acceptability of a product which has been significantly altered. In the case of low-alcohol red wine, we conducted a longitudinal study of consumption in the home, allowing us to measure both the quantities consumed and the hedonic evaluations before and after exposure to the product. During the first phase, 24 consumers {{were divided into two}} separate groups, and, over a two week period, were given wine containing a reduced <b>alcohol</b> content <b>of</b> 9 %, as well as a “standard” wine containing 12. 5 % alcohol. During the second phase, 40 consumers were given a wine containing 12 % alcohol but with a label indicating 10. 5 % or 13. 5 % alcohol, according to the same alternate protocol. The results of the first blind testing suggest a good sensory acceptability <b>of</b> the reduced <b>alcohol</b> wine which persisted after the trial of the two products. The second phase, with information provided, indicated an equivalent psychological acceptability of the supposedly “weak” alcohol level and the supposedly “strong” alcohol level because the quantities of the products consumed were equal regardless of the information accompanying the products.

40|$|Considerable {{evidence}} indicates that the expectations individuals hold about the effects <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> determine, to a <b>degree,</b> the amount <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> they drink.

The present study sought to extend the validation network by utilizing an electrophysiological measure [...] the P 300 component of the Event Related Potentials (ERPs) [...] which is thought to index fundamental neurophysiological processes sensitive to expectancy. Previous research has demonstrated that, when presented with various outcomes <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> consumption, heavier drinkers endorse statements that assert positive and arousing effects <b>of</b> <b>alcohol,</b> while lighter drinkers endorse sedating and negative effects <b>of</b> <b>alcohol.</b> Given {{the sensitivity of the}} P 300 to violation of subjective expectancies, it was hypothesized that P 300 amplitude elicited by stimuli violating one 2 ̆ 7 s alcohol expectancies (e. g., statements describing sedating effects <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> for individuals with high positive expectancies) would be correlated with the participants 2 ̆ 7 alcohol expectancies measured by traditional self-report measures. Participants were presented with statements reflecting a wide range <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> outcome effects, which either violated or confirmed the participant 2 ̆ 7 s own set <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> expectancies, while the ERPs evoked by these stimuli were recorded. As predicted, the P 300 amplitude elicited by negative alcohol expectancy stimuli was positively correlated with the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> endorsement of positive/arousing expectancies on the self-report measure. That is, the higher the individual 2 ̆ 7 s positive/arousing expectancies, the larger the P 300 elicited by stimuli asserting the negative effects <b>of</b> <b>alcohol.</b> There was no significant correlation, however, between P 300 amplitude elicited by positive alcohol expectancy stimuli and the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> endorsement of negative/sedating expectancies on the self-report measure. In sum, variations in the amplitude of the P 300 were consistent with the model <b>of</b> <b>Alcohol</b> Expectancies: Namely, words imputing negative/sedating effects <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> elicited a large P 300 in individuals with high but not low positive alcohol expectancies. By indexing the brain 2 ̆ 7 s electrophysiological response sensitive to expectancy violations, these findings demonstrate concordance between verbal measures <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> expectancies, which by their very nat ure are introspective, and a psychophysiological index of expectancy thought to operate automatically and to be independent of overt responding...|$|R
