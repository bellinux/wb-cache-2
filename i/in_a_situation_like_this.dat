500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Science Journal G. Wayne Clough, the 12th secretary of the Smithsonian Institution assuaged [...] the animosities between critics and proponents of the exhibition: [...] “So I don't think there's anything negative here. I think the Smithsonian tried to do it right. When we heard the concerns, we asked the community to come together and talk about it, and we listened, and some people in that audience had their minds changed, as a matter of fact, but not everybody. So, I think it's time <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> to pause, and for the profession itself to say, [...] "Okay, there's a problem, {{what are you going to}} do about it? And, you remember, the United States never signed the UNESCO treaty.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Empirical {{findings}} support the theoretical argument that the cultural group is a critical factor {{that needs to be}} studied in the context of situational variables. Rather than behaving in line with economic incentives, people are likely to approach the decision to cooperate with an appropriateness framework. An expanded, four factor model of the Logic of Appropriateness, suggests that the cooperation is better explained by the question: [...] "What does a person like me (identity) do (rules) <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> (recognition) given this culture (group)?" ...|$|E
2500|$|I want to {{make this}} {{absolutely}} clear, I never raped anyone. Ever. And the charges of rape were dropped against me back in December [...] Even the state prosecutor involved in this case admitted that he didn't believe I ever raped anyone. The person that made these accusations against me changed her story about what happened that night every single time she told it. So, despite the fact that I never, ever, forced this girl to make out with me, touch me, or anything, {{and despite the fact that}} it was extremely difficult for me to plead guilty to something I absolutely did not do, I chose to take the charge of misdemeanor indecent assault for the sake of avoiding yet more emotional and financial strains on my family, my loved ones, and myself. It's fair to say that the guys in Love Equals Death freaked out when all of this happened. I don't blame them for that – there isn't a guide book to follow <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> They made it clear to me that they needed to focus on the band and their career as best as they could, and that it would be best for me to focus on my defense. It hurt at the time, but I knew I did have to focus on defending myself.|$|E
25|$|There was {{no reason}} to put my life on the line, and the lives of {{everyone}} who depends on me, because of a momentary loss of control..... I vowed to never allow myself to be <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> that again.|$|R

6000|$|She broke down--absolutely collapsed. Devilish {{unpleasant}} it was. I'm hopeless <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> After I'd said, [...] "There, there!" [...] which didn't {{seem to help}} much, I hadn't {{any remarks}} to make.|$|E

[...] "Something accomplished, something done, has earned a night's repose. Not that we're {{going to get it}} yet. I think those fellows are hiding somewhere, and we ought to search the house and rout them out. It's a pity Smith isn't a bloodhound. I like you personally, Smithy, but you're about as much practical use <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> as a cold in the head.

6000|$|What is it {{that one}} enjoys <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> <b>this?</b> Nothing [...] outside of one's self, nothing except one's self and one's [...] own existence.... But most men, tossed as they are by [...] unceasing passion, have little {{knowledge}} of such a state; [...] they taste it imperfectly for a few moments, and then retain [...] {{no more than an}} obscure confused idea of it, that is too [...] weak to let them feel its charm. It would not even be good [...] in the present constitution of things, that in their [...] eagerness for these gentle ecstasies, they should fall into [...] a disgust for the active life in which their duty is [...] prescribed to them by needs that are ever on the increase. [...] But a wretch cut off from human society, who can do nothing [...] here below that is useful and good either for himself or for [...] other people, may in such a state find for all lost human [...] felicities many recompenses, of which neither fortune nor [...] men can ever rob him.|$|E

5000|$|Bob Garfield, {{interviewing}} Colmes for On the Media in 2003, {{asked him}} if he was [...] "the human straw man" [...] and a [...] "foil" [...] rather than an equal of Hannity.

5000|$|I don't see {{the press}} as lying outside the {{political}} institutions that we already have. This is where I feel people ought to realise that the press differs from country to country. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> ours, {{where we need to}} conscientize people, and where we have an illiteracy problem, you use institutions like the press to do the conscientization.|$|R

50|$|Act III {{gives us}} the father's {{perspective}} on the whole situation. He speaks of how, deeply saddened by his younger son's actions, he did the only thing a parent could do <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> - he prayed, and continued loving. When his son finally came home, he joyfully accepted {{him back into the}} family with his complete heart. The only thing that saddens him still is that his older son, though doing all the right things outwardly, is more lost than the younger son ever was, because of his heart-attitude.|$|E
5000|$|The {{considerate}} (relationship-oriented) {{style of}} leadership can be appropriate {{in an environment where}} the situation is moderately favorable or certain. For example, when (1) leader-member relations are good, (2) the task is structured, and (3) position power is either strong or weak. Situations like this exist with research scientists, who do not like superiors to structure the task for them. They prefer to follow their own creative leads in order to solve problems. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> a considerate {{style of leadership}} is preferred over the task-oriented.|$|E
50|$|I {{liked this}} episode. It wasn’t exactly action-packed or {{anything}} like that, but it did feature some nice moments, like a conversation between Gwen and Jack about how dangerous being around him is (shades of similar conversations on Doctor Who). I also very much liked that they are continuing to examine the logistics of exactly what would happen <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> Interestingly, {{no one has yet}} suggested mandatory birth control, but we do see discussions {{about the fact that the}} entire medical industry would have to change from a life-saving position to one that’s more about pain management.|$|E

Context stimuli may come to control behavior as do discriminative stimuli, though usually more weakly. Behaviors learned in one context may be absent, or altered, in another. This may cause difficulties for behavioral therapy, because behaviors learned in the therapeutic setting may fail to occur elsewhere.|$|R

Your memory isn't even working normally. You are so hyped up. Your vision actually changes. Your field of view changes. Your capabilities change. What you are capable of changes. You are under adrenaline, a drug called adrenaline. And you respond very quickly, and you think very quickly. That's all. ... You think! You think, you analyze, and you act. And in any situation, {{you just have to}} think more quickly than your opposition. That's all. You know. Speed is very important.|$|E
5000|$|A {{controversy}} {{regarding the}} soundtrack originated when lyricist Vairamuthu expressed dissatisfaction over the online recording. Rahman defended this saying, [...] "Busy as I was with Bombay Dreams, {{it was simply}} {{impossible for me to}} be in Chennai. Sometimes it is inevitable, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> where the reputation and money of somebody else is at stake." [...] Rahman also faced criticisms from the film fraternity for not recording the songs in time. Another controversy was that Dravida Kazhagam objected to the lyrics of a song that had to be partially deleted from the film later. They have taken objection to what they have called unfair commentary on Periyar E. V. Ramasamy and Ramaswami's ideology.|$|E

50|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> the backlit cat {{in front}} of the window an {{alternate}} strategy would be to expose for the shadow side of the cat and let the background blow out.

50|$|The {{pitch of}} complex tones can be ambiguous, meaning that {{two or more}} {{different}} pitches can be perceived, depending upon the observer. When the actual fundamental frequency can be precisely determined through physical measurement, it may differ from the perceived pitch because of overtones, also known as upper partials, harmonic or otherwise. A complex tone composed of two sine waves of 1000 and 1200 Hz may sometimes be heard as up to three pitches: two spectral pitches at 1000 and 1200 Hz, derived from the physical frequencies of the pure tones, and the combination tone at 200 Hz, corresponding to the repetition rate of the waveform. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> the percept at 200 Hz is {{commonly referred to as}} the missing fundamental, which is often the greatest common divisor of the frequencies present.|$|E
