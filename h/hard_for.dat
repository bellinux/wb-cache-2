5|$|Adopted {{children}} are children that were given up at birth, abandoned or {{were unable to}} be cared for by their biological parents. They may have been put into foster care before finding their permanent residence. It is particularly <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> adopted children to get adopted from foster care: 50,000 children were adopted in 2001. The average age of these children was 7, which shows that fewer older children were adopted.|$|E

5|$|Bobby Hope led Albion to {{a victory}} {{at the start of}} their League Cup campaign, having {{received}} a bye past the first round, scoring a hat-trick as the team went on to defeat Aston Villa 6–0. Albion played Manchester City on 5 October 1966 in the third round, and although they won the game 4–2, they were pressed <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> the victory. Albion went a goal down after nine minutes against Northampton Town, but came back to win 3–1.|$|E

5|$|During 1994 and 1995, Prost {{worked as}} TV pundit for the French TV channel TF1. He {{also worked for}} Renault as a PR man. Prost {{went back to his}} old team McLaren, working as a {{technical}} adviser; he also completed L'Etape du Tour, an annual mass-participation bike ride that takes place on a stage of the Tour de France. Although not an official race, riders fight <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> places; Prost finished 12th in his category, 42nd overall out of over 5000 riders.|$|E

2500|$|International Harvester also unintentionally disempowered {{the union}} negotiators, making it <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> them {{to agree to}} company demands. [...] For example, the company {{repeatedly}} went public with its bargaining proposals, which made it <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> company negotiators to back down later and reach compromises. The company's [...] "match the pay pattern" [...] announcement also {{had the effect of}} depriving union leaders of the ability to claim a [...] "win" [...] in negotiations by claiming they had achieved a pay raise—making it <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> union negotiators to [...] "sell" [...] more hard-to-swallow compromises later, and forcing the union to entrench itself to achieve gains in other areas.|$|R

5|$|A {{scene in}} the episode shows Grampa and Bart driving to Branson with Marge's car, {{listening}} to the radio. Because the scene consists entirely of auditive gags, the Simpsons staff had difficulty figuring out what to show visually during the scene. In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, Jean explained that these scenes “get a really big laugh at the table,” but are subsequently <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> the animators. The scene makes use of a repeated background, an animation technique made famous by Hanna-Barbera in order to cut budget.|$|E

5|$|Alcoholism is characterised by an {{increased}} tolerance to alcohol–which means {{that an individual}} can consume more alcohol–and physical dependence on alcohol, which makes it <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> an individual to control their consumption. The physical dependency caused by alcohol can lead to an affected individual having a very strong urge to drink alcohol. These characteristics play a role decreasing an alcoholic's ability to stop drinking. Alcoholism can have adverse effects on mental health, causing psychiatric disorders and increasing the risk of suicide. A depressed mood is a common symptom of heavy alcohol drinkers.|$|E
5|$|All the seeded players {{received}} a bye {{into the second}} round. Seven seeded players were ousted from the second round including third seed Jelena Janković, who was defeated by Gisela Dulko, and eighth seed Marion Bartoli, who lost to qualifier Anastasiya Yakimova. Second seed Dinara Safina, Vera Zvonareva and Ana Ivanovic were among the nine seeded players who were eliminated in the third round. Three times former champion and fifth seed Venus Williams faced stiff competition from Agnieszka Radwańska in fourth round. Williams lost the first set but prevailed in later sets to win the match. Li Na and Ekaterina Makarova also fought <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> {{a place in the}} quarterfinals, with Li coming out strong in the three set match, winning.|$|E
5|$|By 1889, Manmohan had {{determined}} {{to pursue a}} literary career and Benoybhusan had proved himself unequal to the standards necessary for ICS entrance. This meant that only Aurobindo might fulfil his father's aspirations {{but to do so}} when his father lacked money required that he studied <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> a scholarship. To become an ICS official, students were required to pass the competitive examination, as well as to study at an English university for two years under probation. Aurobindo secured a scholarship at King's College, Cambridge, under recommendation of Oscar Browning. He passed the written ICS examination after a few months, being ranked 11th out of 250 competitors. He spent the next two years at King's College. Aurobindo had no interest in the ICS and came late to the horse-riding practical exam purposefully to get himself disqualified for the service.|$|E

5|$|Hans Bethe {{once said}} that Klaus Fuchs was the only {{physicist}} he knew who truly changed history. Because {{the head of the}} Soviet project, Lavrenti Beria, used foreign intelligence as a third-party check, rather than giving it directly to the scientists, as he did not trust the information by default, it is unknown whether Fuchs's fission information had a substantial effect. Considering that the pace of the Soviet program was set primarily by the amount of uranium they could procure, it is <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> scholars to accurately judge how much time this saved.|$|E
5|$|Harvard {{refused to}} attend the rules conference {{organized}} by the other schools and continued to play under its own code. While Harvard's decision to maintain its code made it <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> them to schedule games against other American universities, it agreed to play McGill University, from Montreal, in a two-game series in 1874. Harvard won the first game, in which its rules were used, 3–0. The second game, which was played under rugby regulations, {{did not have a}} winner as neither team managed to score.|$|E

She had been training <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> the World Cup and had to stop competing {{for a few months}} to recover; she was devastated to miss the first World Cup in the sport.
