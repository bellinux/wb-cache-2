5|$|In 1796, {{following}} the secret {{terms of the}} Treaty of San Ildefonso, the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Spain</b> suddenly reversed {{its position in the}} French Revolutionary Wars turning from an enemy of the French Republic into an ally. The Spanish declaration of war on Great Britain forced the British Mediterranean Fleet to abandon the Mediterranean Sea entirely, retreating to ports at Gibraltar and Lisbon. This force now concentrated against the Spanish Navy, most of which was stationed at the main fleet base of Cádiz in Southern Spain. A British blockade fleet won a significant victory over the Spanish at the Battle of Cape St Vincent in February 1797, dissuading the Spanish fleet from playing {{a significant role in the}} ongoing war.|$|E

The Christian Crown of Castile annexed it in 1309, lost it again to the Moors in 1333 and finally regained it in 1462. Gibraltar {{became part of}} the unified <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Spain</b> and remained under Spanish rule until 1704.

5|$|In late 1796, {{with the}} French Revolutionary Wars three years old, {{a major shift}} {{occurred}} in the conflict when the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Spain,</b> until that point {{an enemy of the}} French Republic, abruptly changed sides following the signing of the Treaty of San Ildefonso. This reversal forced the British Royal Navy to retire from the Mediterranean Sea to preserve its lines of communication, falling back to the mouth of the Tagus River near Lisbon. From the Tagus, pressure was placed on the Spanish Navy by the erstwhile British Mediterranean Fleet under Vice-Admiral Sir John Jervis, who organised a blockade of the main Spanish fleet base at Cádiz on the country's Southern Atlantic coast. This resulted in the Battle of Cape St. Vincent on 14 February 1797, when Jervis inflicted a stinging defeat on the Spanish fleet. The surviving Spanish ships limped back to Cádiz after the battle, and to ensure that they could not sail again without risking a repeat action, Jervis arranged a close blockade of the port so that by April there were 21 British ships of the line and numerous frigates watching the Spanish fleet at anchor.|$|E
