500|$|The {{idea for}} the film came when Emmerich and Devlin were in Europe {{promoting}} their film Stargate. A reporter asked Emmerich why he made a film with content like Stargate {{if he did not}} believe in aliens. Emmerich stated he was still fascinated by the idea of an alien arrival, and further explained his response by asking the reporter to <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> like to wake up one morning and to discover 15 mile-wide spaceships were hovering over the world's largest cities. Emmerich then turned to Devlin and said, [...] "I think I have an idea for our next film." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 2015, Cornell openly said in {{interview}} with Total Guitar {{that he was}} quite eager to reunite with Audioslave: [...] "I {{think it would be}} great. We did a lot of songs, and with the benefit of not having done anything with those guys for so long, I can't <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be.</b> It would be a really amazing experience just to get back and work with the same guys again." [...] Soon after, Morello said that he's interested in working with Cornell again, remembering their 2014 Seattle performance with great fondness: [...] "I love Chris and consider him a great friend. The Hall of Fame jam was nice, but a little chaotic. Playing with him in Seattle, that was just fantastic. I love that guy. He's one of the most talented vocalists in the history of vocalists. And {{to be able to play}} the songs that we wrote together, it was awesome and so much fun. I hope we do something like that again." ...|$|E

I am really nervous but now we have started rehearsing, I am feeling equally excited. It will {{definitely}} be an experience and I hope Perry runs smoothly!" [...] She also said she was [...] "terrified" [...] of acting out the birth, saying she would prefer to give birth in real life. She said that filming the pre-recorded labour scenes meant she [...] "was knackered after screaming and crying and pretending to push all day." [...] In an interview with Digital Spy, she said that she was [...] "really, really nervous" [...] and that the prospect of acting the birth was [...] "very scary", but added, [...] "I really appreciate that they've given me the opportunity, especially considering that I haven't been here at EastEnders for that long. It's really nice that they've trusted me with it, so hopefully I'll do it justice! It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it'll go well." [...] To help prepare, she asked several women for advice, including her mother, and was told [...] "It's the worst pain you can ever imagine!" [...] She found it [...] "quite difficult" [...] to <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> like to act out as she has no children, but had watched Channel 4 show One Born Every Minute to help, as she did not want to [...] "overdo the scene or make it look really fake." ...|$|E

5000|$|The Fun Songs {{version is}} {{performed}} in a 1994 Disney Sing-Along Songs home video: Let's Go to the Circus.

2500|$|On July 6, 2005, a {{group of}} more than 20 {{religious}} leaders from the Guilford [...] County area, [...] "including those of Christian, Jewish and Buddhist faiths", {{sent a letter to}} Superior Court Judge W. Douglas Albright, who said an oath on the Quran is not lawful. The letter noted that [...] "North Carolina is an increasingly diverse place and says that religious differences need to be respected." [...] It went on to say [...] "In North Carolina, we continue to be people who take our religious beliefs and practices very seriously. But we no longer live in the Bible Belt. Today, we live in the Bible-Talmud-Qur'an-Veda-Dhammapada-Guru Granth Sahib-Kitabi Iqan Belt. It is imperative for our civic leaders, school teachers, judges, and law enforcers to appreciate and respect the religious differences found in our population." [...] The executive director of FaithAction (an interfaith organization) Rev. Mark Sills, signed the letter and said that the Qur'an oath case [...] "struck us as an issue that needs to be confronted". He asked Christians to <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> like to live in a place where the Bible was not allowed for oaths, saying [...] "That just feels like a slap in the face." [...] Rev. Julie Peeples, pastor of Greensboro's Congregational United Church of Christ, signed the letter and said [...] "I think it's an opportunity to foster greater respect for all the traditions we have in Greensboro." [...] The superintendent of the Greensboro District of the United Methodist Church, Rev. Frank Stith, said [...] "it makes sense for {{people to be able to}} use a book that means something to them", explaining [...] "The point is to have something that stands behind someone's word." ...|$|E

It's made up of love songs, but they are more specifically songs arguing for love, acting casual, wishing and hoping and then <b>imagining</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be like to consummate. Early days and misadventures. It's soul-baring, but mirrored and fairly guarded." [...] —Frannie Kelley, NPR ...|$|R

50|$|During the ’50s and ’60s, comic writers {{regularly}} made Wonder Woman lovesick over Steve Trevor, here a Major in the United States Army. Stories frequently featured Wonder Woman hoping or <b>imagining</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be like {{to marry}} Steve Trevor. As with Superman stories of the same period, the question of marriage was never far from the couple's minds. There was also considerable attention given {{to the threat of}} the Amazon's secret identity being revealed.|$|R
6000|$|... “So she {{was good}} enough to call it. But I deny it all. If one had to have an affection for every woman one used to sit up ‘evenings’ with—!” And Littlemore had paused, not {{defining}} the result of such an obligation.

60|$|John {{was much}} shocked, {{and sat in}} the solitary drawing-room, {{thinking}} over the disappointment and loss, severely felt for his own sake, and far more for the poor young mother, threatened with so grievous a trial at an age when sorrow is usually scarcely known, and when she had well-nigh sunk under the ordinary wear and tear of married life. She had been so utterly cast down and wretched {{at the sight of the}} child's suffering, that it was fearful to <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> when there would be no recovery.|$|E
6000|$|What a {{question}} was this {{to ask of}} a man who had spent all his life in the Internal Navigation Office! O reader! should it chance that thou art a clergyman, <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to thee, wert thou asked what is the exact use of the Church of England; and that, too, by some stubborn catechist whom thou wert bound to answer; or, if a lady, happy in a husband and family, say, what would be thy feelings if demanded to define the exact use of matrimony? Use! Is it not all in all to thee? ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{have another}} far more solid and central ground for {{submitting}} {{to it as}} a faith, instead of merely picking up hints from it as a scheme. And that is this: that the Christian Church in its practical relation to my soul is a living teacher, not a dead one. It not only certainly taught me yesterday, but will almost certainly teach me to-morrow. Once I saw suddenly the meaning of the shape of the cross; some day I may see suddenly the meaning of the shape of the mitre. One fine morning I saw why windows were pointed; some fine morning I may see why priests were shaven. Plato has told you a truth; but Plato is dead. Shakespeare has startled you with an image; but Shakespeare will not startle you with any more. But <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to live with such men still living, to know that Plato might break out with an original lecture to-morrow, or that at any moment Shakespeare might shatter everything with a single song. The man who lives in contact with what he believes to be a living Church is a man always expecting to meet Plato and Shakespeare to-morrow at breakfast. He is always expecting to see some truth that he has never seen before. There is one only other parallel to this position; and that is the parallel of the life in which we all began. When your father told you, walking about the garden, that bees stung or that roses smelt sweet, you did not talk of taking the best out of his philosophy. When the bees stung you, you did not call it an entertaining coincidence. When the rose smelt sweet you did not say [...] "My father is a rude, barbaric symbol, enshrining (perhaps unconsciously) the deep delicate truths that flowers smell." [...] No: you believed your father, because you had found him to be a living fountain of facts, a thing that really knew more than you; a thing that would tell you truth to-morrow, as well as to-day. And if this was true of your father, it was even truer of your mother; at least it was true of mine, to whom this book is dedicated. Now, when society is in a rather futile fuss about the subjection of women, will no one say how much every man owes to the tyranny and privilege of women, {{to the fact that they}} alone rule education until education becomes futile: for a boy is only sent to be taught at school when it is too late to teach him anything. The real thing has been done already, and thank God it is nearly always done by women. Every man is womanised, merely by being born. They talk of the masculine woman; but every man is a feminised man. And if ever men walk to Westminster to protest against this female privilege, I shall not join their procession.|$|E

50|$|The {{idea is to}} <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> like if {{the product}} existed, and act as though it exists, ideally in the place it would be used.

He was also inspired by a report about two Papua New Guinean tribesmen who briefly visited an Australian city, and the child's myth of digging through the earth and coming out the other side.

50|$|On the contrary, {{passions of}} the {{imagination}}, such as loss of love or ambition, {{are easy to}} sympathize with because our imagination can conform {{to the shape of}} the sufferer, whereas our body cannot do such a thing to the body of the sufferer. Pain is fleeting and the harm only lasts as long as the violence is inflicted, whereas an insult lasts to harm for longer duration because our imagination keeps mulling it over. Likewise, bodily pain that induces fear, such as a cut, wound or fracture, evoke sympathy because of the danger that they imply for ourselves; that is, sympathy is activated chiefly through <b>imagining</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be like for us.|$|R

Takuya dashes in full speed and saves his little brother. After coming home and seeing Minoru sobbing, Takuya realizes that Minoru cries because he is just lonely and becomes ashamed of himself. From then on, Takuya learns to love his little brother as family and his long life story of being a mother and a brother at once begins.|$|R
