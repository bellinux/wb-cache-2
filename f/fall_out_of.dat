5|$|Analysis {{of the two}} {{combat system}} {{proposals}} saw Signaal <b>fall</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> favour with the tender reviewers. This was primarily attributed to a cost-reducing re-design late in the process: the changes were not fully documented because of time constraints. Supporting documentation was further criticised by the reviewers for being vaguely worded and not using milspec terminology and standards. In addition, the system proposed by Rockwell appeared to have greater performance capabilities, and would be cheaper to implement.|$|E
5|$|By 1920 variety theatre {{had become}} popular in Britain, and Robey had {{completed}} the successful transition from music hall to variety star. Pantomime, which relied on its stars to make up much of the script through ad lib, was also beginning to <b>fall</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> favour, and his contemporaries were finding it too difficult to create fresh material for every performance; for Robey, however, the festive entertainment {{continued to be a}} lucrative source of employment.|$|E
5|$|Danebury was {{abandoned}} around 100BC, {{in common with}} the trend across Britain for hill forts to <b>fall</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> use around that time. Once again, the east gate was burnt down, although this time it was not replaced. Most of the inhabitants deserted Danebury, and groups of bodies were disposed of in charnel pits. The site continued in use, but on a much smaller scale than before. Buildings were left to decay and the interior of the fort became used for grazing. By the start of the 1st centuryAD, the settlement of Danebury was probably nothing more than a single farm.|$|E

5|$|Iron ships {{had first}} been {{proposed}} for military {{use in the}} 1820s. In the 1830s and 1840s, France, Britain and the United States had all experimented with iron-hulled but unarmored gunboats and frigates. However, the iron-hulled frigate was abandoned {{by the end of}} the 1840s, because iron hulls were more vulnerable to solid shot; iron was more brittle than wood, and iron frames more likely to <b>fall</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> shape than wood.|$|E
5|$|Losing {{power and}} speed, Roma began to <b>fall</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the battle group. Around 16:02, another Fritz X {{slammed into the}} {{starboard}} side of Romas deck, between frames 123 and 136. It most likely detonated in the forward engine room, sparking flames, and causing heavy flooding in the magazines of main battery turret number two and the fore port side secondary battery turret, and putting even more pressure upon the previously stressed hull girder. Seconds after the initial blast, the number two 15-inch turret was blown over the side by a massive explosion, this time from the detonation of that turret's magazines.|$|E
5|$|One {{plot device}} {{used in the}} pilot, Henry's pocket watch, proved to be {{difficult}} to use in subsequent episodes. In the beginning, the writers would have Henry's pocket watch <b>fall</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his pocket so that it would not disappear {{with the rest of his}} body. It became more difficult for writers to develop believable scenarios in which Henry would lose his watch, so they did not write it into the plot as frequently in later episodes.|$|E

5|$|Although castle {{construction}} faded {{towards the}} end of the 16thcentury, castles did not necessarily all <b>fall</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> use. Some retained a role in local administration and became law courts, while others are still handed down in aristocratic families as hereditary seats. A particularly famous example of this is Windsor Castle in England which was founded in the 11thcentury and is home to the monarch of the United Kingdom. In other cases they still had a role in defence. Tower houses, which are closely related to castles and include pele towers, were defended towers that were permanent residences built in the 14th to 17th centuries. Especially common in Ireland and Scotland, they could be up to five storeys high and succeeded common enclosure castles and were built by a greater social range of people. While unlikely to provide as much protection as a more complex castle, they offered security against raiders and other small threats.|$|E
5|$|Churchill did {{not support}} the government, however. In July, he had advised the King's legal counsel, Walter Monckton, against the divorce, but his advice was ignored. As soon as the affair became public knowledge, Churchill started to {{pressure}} Baldwin and the King to delay any decisions until parliament and the people had been consulted. In a private letter to Geoffrey Dawson, the editor of The Times newspaper, Churchill suggested that a delay would be beneficial because, given time, the King might <b>fall</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> love with Simpson. Baldwin rejected the request for delay, presumably because he preferred to resolve the crisis quickly. Supporters of the King alleged a conspiracy between Baldwin, Geoffrey Dawson, and Cosmo Gordon Lang, the Archbishop of Canterbury. The royal physician Bertrand Dawson was possibly involved in a plan to force the prime minister to retire on the grounds of heart disease, but he eventually accepted, on the evidence of an early electrocardiograph, that Baldwin's heart was sound.|$|E
5|$|Drowned God was {{released}} on October31, 1996 for the Windows 95 operating system. In its first two weeks, it sold 34,000copies in the United States. It {{was one of the}} top ten best-selling video games in United States during the first month after its release, but bugs and poor support from the developers caused it to <b>fall</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> favor with gamers by December. By February 1998, the game had sold over 60,000copies. Around the time of the game's release, Horse stated that its story was incomplete, and {{that the rest of the}} story would be revealed in a sequel called CULT, planned to center around Area51. However, he killed himself, as well as his wife and pets, a decade after the game's release, and no sequel was ever completed.|$|E

5|$|Matthew Brettingham (1699 – 19 August 1769), {{sometimes}} called Matthew Brettingham the Elder, was an 18th-century Englishman who rose from humble origins {{to supervise the}} construction of Holkham Hall, and {{become one of the}} country's best-known architects of his generation. Much of his principal work has since been demolished, particularly his work in London, where he revolutionised the design of the grand townhouse. As a result, he is often overlooked today, remembered principally for his Palladian remodelling of numerous country houses, many of them situated in the East Anglia area of Britain. As Brettingham neared the pinnacle of his career, Palladianism began to <b>fall</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> fashion and neoclassicism was introduced, championed by the young Robert Adam.|$|E
5|$|Seismometer: The Chinese polymath and {{inventor}} Zhang Heng (78–139) of the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) {{invented the}} first seismometer in 132, a large metal urn-shaped instrument which employed either a suspended pendulum or inverted pendulum acting on inertia (i.e. ground tremors from earthquakes) to dislodge a metal ball by a lever trip device; this ball would <b>fall</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> dragon-shaped metal mouth into the corresponding metal toad mouth indicating the exact cardinal direction of where a distant earthquake {{had occurred in}} order for the state to send swift aid and relief to the affected regions; several subsequent recreations of his device were employed by Chinese states up until the Tang Dynasty (618–907), when use of the device fell into obscurity, a fact noted even by the writer Zhou Mi around 1290, during the Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368).|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before his}} death in 1953, Stalin {{considered}} launching a new purge against Mikoyan, Vyacheslav Molotov, and several other Party leaders. Mikoyan and others gradually began to <b>fall</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> favor and, in one instance, were accused of plotting against Stalin. Stalin's plans never came to fruition, however, as he died before he could put them into motion. Mikoyan originally argued in favor of keeping Stalin's right-hand man Beria from punishment but later gave in to popular support among Party members for his arrest. Mikoyan remained in the government after Stalin's death, in the post of Minister of Trade, under Malenkov. He supported Nikita Khrushchev in the power struggle to succeed Stalin, and became First Deputy Premier in recognition of his services.|$|E

5|$|The final {{match was}} for the WWE Championship between Champion John Cena and CM Punk. WWE Chairman Vince McMahon had {{threatened}} to have Cena fired if Punk won. During the match, two separate signature Attitude Adjustment moves by Cena failed to score the victory. More than 30 minutes into the match, Punk performed his Go to Sleep maneuver, striking Cena's ribs and causing Cena to <b>fall</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the ring. As Punk rolled Cena back into the ring, McMahon and John Laurinaitis emerged from backstage and distracted Punk, resulting in Cena placing Punk in the STF submission hold. Punk did not submit, but McMahon signaled the referee to award Cena the match and sent Laurinaitis to ring the bell. This was reminiscent of the Montreal Screwjob in 1997, where a conspiracy orchestrated by McMahon led to Bret Hart losing his WWF Championship to Shawn Michaels by submission despite Hart never submitting.|$|E
5|$|In the 2017 Rogers Cup, held in Montreal, Nadal had {{a chance}} to regain the ATP No. 1 ranking if he made the semi-finals; however, he lost in the 3rd round to Canadian {{teenager}} Denis Shapovalov. Federer progressed to the final, where he lost to Alexander Zverev and sustained an injury during the second set. Due to the renewed back injury, Federer then pulled out of the 2017 Cincinnati Masters, leaving Nadal as the only Big Four player competing there and allowing him to reclaim the ATP No. 1 ranking. In the 2017 Cincinnati Masters, Nadal was knocked out by Nick Kyrgios in the quarter-finals, breaking the streak of 42 consecutive Big Four appearances in Masters 1000 semi-finals and finals. At the US Open, Nadal was be seeded first (for the first time at a major since 2014), Murray second, and Federer, who is only 5 points behind Murray, third. The 2017 US Open would also be the first major Djokovic has missed after a streak of 51 consecutive appearances. Furthermore, Murray ultimately pulled out of the US Open, having not recovered from his hip injury suffered during Wimbledon, leaving just Nadal and Federer as the only Big Four players remaining in the draw. With this withdrawal, Murray would <b>fall</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the top 2 {{for the first time since}} May 2016. Nadal made the semi-finals, while Federer lost in the quarter-finals to Juan Martin del Potro. This loss ended Federer's undefeated record in Grand Slam matches during 2017, and also marked the sixth time that both Federer and Nadal came within one match of meeting each other at the US Open, but did not do so due to one of them losing. This phenomenon previously occurred at the semi-finals of all US Opens between 2008 and 2011, and in the fourth round of the 2013 tournament. Nadal then defeated Del Potro to reach his first US Open final since 2013, and defeated Kevin Anderson in the final to win his third US Open title.|$|E
