40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an augmented Lagrangian optimization method for the numerical simulation of the inflation process in the design of inflatable space structures. Although the Newton-Raphson scheme was proven to be efficient for solving many nonlinear problems, it can lead to lack of convergence when it is applied to the simulation of the inflation process. As a result, it is recommended to use an optimization algorithm to find the minimum energy configuration that satisfies the equilibrium equations characterizing the final shape of the <b>inflated</b> <b>structure</b> subject to an internal pressure. On top of that, given that some degrees of freedom may be linked, the optimum may be constrained, and specific optimization methods for constrained problems must be considered. The paper presents the formulation and the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) developed in SAMCEF Mecano for inflatable structures analysis problems. The related quasi-unconstrained optimization problem is solved with a nonlinear conjugate gradient method. The Wolfe conditions are used in conjunction with a cubic interpolation for the line search. Equality constraints are considered and can be easily treated by the ALM formulation. Numerical applications present simulations of unconstrained and constrained inflation processes (i. e., where the motion of some nodes is ruled by a rigid body element restriction and/or problems including contact conditions) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{photosynthetic}} capacity and carbon metabolism of {{the fruits of}} Isomeris arborea(Capparidaceae), an evergreen shrub endemic to the desert and coastal habitats of Southern California and Baja California, are described. The <b>inflated</b> <b>structure</b> of the pods of I. arboreaprovides a model system for experimental studies of fruit photosynthesis in native plants since the gas concentration of the internal space can be manipulated and monitored separately from the external pod environment. CO 2 released by seed respiration is partially contained in the inner gas space of the pods, resulting in an elevated CO 2 environment inside the fruit (500 to 4000 Œºmol mol‚àí 1 depending {{on the stage of}} fruit development). A portion of this CO 2 is assimilated by the inner layers of the pericarp, but a larger fraction leaks out. The photosynthetic layers of the pericarp use two different sources of CO 2 : the exocarp fixes exogenous CO 2 while the endocarp fixes CO 2 released by seed respiration into the pod cavity. Even though the total weight of the fruit increases during development, the combined rates of fixation of externally and internally supplied CO 2 remained constant (10 ‚Äì 11 Œºmol CO 2 pod‚àí 1 h‚àí 1). After the pods attain maximum volume, the major change in gas exchange that takes place during fruit growth is a gradual increase in the amount of respiratory CO 2 released by the seeds. This shifts the CO 2 balance of the fruit from positive, in young fruits, to negative in mature fruits. Pericap photosynthesis helped support not only the cost of fruit maintenance, but also the cost of fruit growth, particularly during the first stages of fruit development. During later fruiting stages insufficient carbon is fixed to fully supply either respiration or growth...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} two decades there has been an {{increasing}} interest in the development of inflatable structures on account of their potential applications in the erection of space and under-water structures. The stability of inflatable structures for use in the fluid environment is founded on such advantages as light weight, ability to carry the environmental forces efficiently by direct tensile stress and abiIity to utiIize the water pressure to counterba lance the gas pressure. The extensive possible applications of inflatable structures in ocean technology have emphasized the demand for investigations aimed at better understanding of the structural and hydraulic behaviour of these structures. The present study is concerned with the structural and hydraulic analysis of a gas-inflated membrane structure fully submerged in water. The structural analysis of such a structure involves the determination of the profile shape and the tension in the membrane for given inflation and load conditions. This is carried out by the numerical solution of the differential equations of equilibrium of the membrane. The results have been confirmed by an experimental investigation. The incorporation of a two-way set of reinforcing cables has also been considered. The effect of the spacing of the reinforcing cables for various membrane geometries is studied. Also, the effect of partially drawing-off the internal gas of the <b>inflated</b> <b>structure</b> as a result of which, water enters the container, is examined. The hydraulic aspect of this study is mostly concentrated on the investigation of the effect of waves and currents on the proposed structure. Models of the proposed structure have been tested using wind tunnel and wave flume. The results show the effects of currents and waves on the pressure distributions around the models and on the inertia forces. The changes {{in the shape of the}} structure and the tension in the membrane due to the effect of a uniform current are assessed. The scouring action of the current has also been investigated experimentally and qualitative results have been obtained. A general computer program has been developed which can handle structures with up to 300 joints and can be used efficiently for the analysis of many types of cable and suspended structures under different loading conditions. Numerical results are generated for the proposed inflated cable-reinforced structure. Finally, the application of such structures for the storage of hydrogen produced from the electrolysis of water using surplus electricity and the storage of associated gas from offshore oil wells is considered. The work carried out in this thesis shows that the proposed structure is feasible and the results presented may be used as a gUidel ine in the design.

This warm stream of air is leaving part of its thermodynamic energy to the air turbines placed in the path of the airflow. The solar chimney power stations were named Solar Aero-Electric Power Plants (SAEPPs) due to their similarity to Hydro Electric Power Plants. The efficiency of the SAEPPs is roughly proportional to the height of their solar chimneys. Solar Chimneys can be made as reinforced concrete structures (Concrete Solar Chimneys, CFCs), or as lighter than air <b>inflated</b> <b>structures</b> (Floating Solar Chimneys FSCs). These floating solar chimneys are made by successive balloon tubes, filled with a lighter than air gas. This permits to the FSCs to float in the air and thus to have heights 1. 5 √∑ 3 Km giving to their SAEPPs higher efficiencies than Concrete Solar Chimney SAEPPs. Using ground thermal storage, or artificial thermal storage in the form of water in closed plastic tubes, it can be proved that the SAEPPs can operate 24 hours per day 365 days per year with a minimum guaranteed power production. This means that the SAEPPs, although renewable by nature, can have a similar operation to conventional power stations and thus can replace them. In the present paper a comparison for construction cost of SAEPPs with Floating Solar Chimneys and Concrete Solar Chimneys is given.
