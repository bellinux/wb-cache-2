The P system had great parallelism is applied in the engineering systems just beginning. In this paper, an automatic online marking-management model (AOMMM) based on membrane computing is constructed, which can find marker had quality problems and remind the markers and the leader automatically. According to the basal rules of membrane computing, the management rules of the proposed AOMMM are designed. Through {{the analysis of the}} computational time complexity of the proposed model, we find that only three steps (O (1)) are needed to complete the <b>feedback</b> <b>operation.</b> Experimental result shows that the proposed model is appropriate for online marking management.

40|$|Abstract. The {{resistive}} wall mode (RWM) and neoclassical tearing mode (NTM) {{have been}} simultaneously suppressed in the DIII-D for durations over 2 seconds at beta values 20 % above the no-wall limit with modest electron cyclotron current drive (ECCD) and low plasma rotation. The critical plasma rotation {{was significantly lower}} than reported at the IAEA FEC in 2006. However, even in this stabilized regime, stable steady-state operation is not unconditionally guaranteed. Various localized MHD activities such as edge localized modes (ELMs) and fishbones begin to couple to the RWM branch near the no-wall limit. Feedback is useful to improve the stability. Simultaneous operation of slow dynamic error field correction and fast feedback suppressed the ELM-induced RWM at high normalized beta. The result implies that successful <b>feedback</b> <b>operation</b> requires careful control of residual RWMs. The effectiveness of <b>feedback</b> <b>operation</b> was demonstrated using a reproducible current-driven RWM.

40|$|Abstract —Digital halftoning is {{a process}} to convert a continuous-tone image into a binary image with black and white dots. This process is {{necessary}} to print a continuous-tone image using printers. The Error Diffusion {{is one of the}} most popular methods of digital halftoning, because it can generates high quality output images with relatively low computing time. Binary images generated by the Error Diffusion are fine grained in the sense that they have a lot of isolated small black and white dots. However, fine binary images are not appropriate for practical printing, because isolated black and white dots may disappear by dot-gain or dot-loss. Hence cluster-dot halftoning, which generates binary images has no isolated black and white dots are important. It is known that the Error Diffusion with some <b>feedback</b> <b>operation</b> can generate clustered-dot binary images. However, the resulting binary images have strong directional characteristic, which spoils the printing results. The main contribution of this paper is to presents new filters of the Error Diffusion for cluster-dot halftoning with no directional characteristic. Quite surprisingly, it can generate cluster-dot binary images with no directional characteristic using our new filter. Also, the size of cluster can be adjusted by an additional <b>feedback</b> <b>operation.</b> The experimental results show that the Error Diffusion using our new filter can generate better quality binary images than the previously published know results...|$|E

40|$|Several {{mechanisms}} for self-enhancing feedback instabilities in marine ecosystems are identified and briefly elaborated. It appears that adverse phases of operation may be abruptly triggered by explosive breakouts in abundance {{of one or}} more previously suppressed populations. Moreover, an evident capacity of marine organisms to accomplish extensive geographic habitat expansions may expand and perpetuate a breakout event. This set of conceptual elements provides a framework for interpretation of a sequence of events that has occurred in the Northern Benguela Current Large Marine Ecosystem (off south-western Africa). This history can illustrate how multiple feedback loops might interact with one another in unanticipated and quite malignant ways, leading not only to collapse of customary resource stocks but also to degradation of the ecosystem {{to such an extent that}} disruption of customary goods and services may go beyond fisheries alone to adversely affect other major global ecosystem concerns (e. g. proliferations of jellyfish and other slimy, stingy, toxic and/or noxious organisms, perhaps even climate change itself, etc.).

40|$|The Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) is an {{instrument}} used {{for studying the}} topography of samples with nanometer resolution. Possible samples include specific materials or biological samples. The AFM is a mechanical microscope, since a three dimensional topography image is constructed by raster scanning a sharp tip and a sample surface {{in close proximity to}} each other and monitoring tip-sample interactions. The tip-sample interaction is controlled in all three dimensions by means of a piezoelectrical scanning unit which consists of a vertical positioner and a lateral positioner. The vertical positioner is controlled via a <b>feedback</b> <b>operation</b> to control the tip-sample distance. The topography image is based on the control signal being sent to the vertical positioner to move it up or down. The vertical positioner consists of a piezo actuator which suffers from nonlinear behavior due to hysteresis and creep. Due to the nonlinearities, the ratio between the control signal and the resulting vertical displacement is not constant over the full positioning range of the piezo actuator. In current dynamic modes of AFM {{a large part of the}} piezo positioning range is used. Therefore, a more direct method to obtain the displacement of the vertical positioner is desired which enables a more accurate estimate for the sample topography. To this end, in this thesis a displacement sensor is added to the vertical positioner of the AFM. The resulting displacement sensor yields a variation in measured step height in the order of 6 %, compared to 35 % for the conventional control signal when imaging a calibration sample. The lateral positioner is controlled via a <b>feedback</b> <b>operation</b> to maintain high positional accuracy in spite of unknown disturbances and model uncertainty. In this <b>feedback</b> <b>operation,</b> the dynamics of the lateral positioner limit the speed of the AFM. Therefore, for the lateral positioner modern control methods can be used to improve the speed of the AFM. The simulation results for the lateral positioner show that with the use of model based control and H-infinity control the scanning speed can be increased with a factor of 5 when compared to the standard PI controlled system. At the same time the control error for the model based controlled system and the H-infinity controlled system becomes smaller with a factor of 4 and 8, respectively. The bandwidth for the PI controlled system is only 50 [Hz], which is much smaller than the bandwidth for the model based controlled system (1900 [Hz]) and the H 1 controlled system (3000 [Hz]). This means a bandwidth improvement with a factor of 38 and 60, respectively. However, further experiments must be carried out to validate the simulation results.
