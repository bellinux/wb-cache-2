500|$|When {{asked if}} the 1995 thriller film Seven was an {{inspiration}} to Saw, Whannell said [...] "For me as the writer, definitely. I mean, Seven is just a very well constructed film, and if you're writing a thriller, it can't hurt to study it. In terms of the story though, James and I never really felt Seven was that close to our film. I guess <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>stand</b> back, you have two detectives chasing a psychopath, who uses vile methods to teach people lessons, and those points echo Seven. What we always liked about Saw, though, {{was the fact that}} the story is told from the point of view of two of the psychopath's victims, instead of the police chasing after him, as you so often see." [...] Entertainment Weekly Owen Gleiberman compared the plot to Seven saying, [...] "In a blatant imitation of Seven, Saw features a lunatic sadist whose ghoulish crimes are meant, in each case, to mirror the sins of his victims. The twist here is that the psycho doesn't do the killing." [...] Richard J. Leskosky of Champaign-Urbana's The News-Gazette said [...] "Saw wants to be taken as another Seven. Though it features perverse gross-out scenes and a villain with a superficially pedantic motive behind his crimes (his victims, if they survive, have learned to appreciate life more), it lacks the finesse and polish of the David Fincher film." ...|$|E

[...] Jacintha and Eric read and wrote poetry, and dreamed of becoming famous writers. He said that he might write a book in the style of H. G. Wells's A Modern Utopia. During this period, he also enjoyed shooting, fishing and birdwatching with Jacintha's brother and sister.|$|E
2500|$|Objects {{viewed in}} a (plane) mirror will appear {{laterally}} inverted (e.g., if one raises one's right hand, the image's left hand will appear {{to go up}} in the mirror), but not vertically inverted (in the image a person's head still appears above his body). However, a mirror does not usually [...] "swap" [...] left and right any more than it swaps top and bottom. A mirror typically reverses the forward/backward axis. To be precise, it reverses the object in the direction perpendicular to the mirror surface (the normal). Because left and right are defined relative to front-back and top-bottom, the [...] "flipping" [...] of front and back results in the perception of a left-right reversal in the image. (<b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>stand</b> side-on to a mirror, the mirror really does reverse your left and right, because that's the direction perpendicular to the mirror.) ...|$|E
