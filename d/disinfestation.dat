40|$|Non-chemical control {{methods have}} gained {{importance}} in integrated pest management, as policies aiming {{to minimize the}} application of residual chemical insecticides are being adopted by many companies, and a growing market of organic produce. The associations of organic farming have established self-restrictions concerning chemical control. Examples are given of how organically producing farms and processing companies function without synthetic chemical pesticides. Both nonchemical control methods for complete <b>disinfestations</b> and for suppression of re-infestation or residual infestations are needed. For complete <b>disinfestations,</b> heat treatment of buildings is now more widely used. Data on heat-tolerance of stored-product pests and an example for a heat treatment of a mill will be given. For high-value products such as spices, tea or medical plants, deep freezing is applied. Temperature data are needed to apply product-specific freezing conditions to obtain complete control {{at the core of}} the bulk. An integrated management strategy is needed to keep products free from infestation following <b>disinfestations,</b> along the whole chain from the storage of raw products to the consumer. Biological control is a part of that strategy. A new branch of the biological control industry is developing in Europe. Natural enemies for stored-product pests are now produced in The Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland. Traditional pest control companies are using insect parasites and predators more and more to control stored-product insects, indicating an adoption of biological control. Homeowners throughout Europe are purchasing online Trichogramma sp. to control moth pests. Biological control is especially attractive to processing facilities that are not willing to stop production for pest control operations. Small farms with bulk grain stores that are not gas-tight apply parasitoids as well. Recommendations for the application of natural enemies are presented for these examples. Finally, recent developments on natural enemies both for stored-product pests, e. g. flour beetles, and museum and wood boring pests are presented...|$|R

The computer model was built for soybeanswith both low and high moisture contents placed in the rectangular shaped polypropylene and polystyrene containers and heated in a parallel plate RF system. Results showed that the temperature uniformity was greatly improved by placing soybean samples in the polystyrene container other than the polypropylene one. The maximumtemperature difference and uniformity index (UI) were reduced. The inner corner radius of 8 cmcombinedwith container thickness of 8 cmcould provide the best heating uniformity for soybeans.

5000|$|Embryos are {{manually}} excised {{and placed}} immediately onto a culture medium {{that provides the}} proper nutrients to support survival and growth (Miyajima 2006). While the <b>disinfestation</b> and explant excision processes differ for these three techniques, many {{of the factors that}} contribute to the successful recovery of viable plants are similar. The main factors that influence success are; the time of culture, the composition of the medium, and temperature and light. Timing mainly refers to the maturation stage of the embryo before excision. The optimal time especially for the rescue of embryos involving incompatible crosses would be just prior to embryo abortion. Nevertheless, due to difficulties involved with the rearing of young embryos compared to those that have reached the autotrophic phase of development, embryos are normally allowed to develop in vivo as long as possible. While in general, two main types of basal media are the most commonly used for embryo rescue studies, i.e. Murashige and Skoog medium (MS) [...] and Gamborg’s B-5 media (Bridgen, 1994), the composition of the medium will vary in terms of the concentrations of media supplements required. This will generally depend on the stage of development of the embryo. For instance, young embryos would require a complex medium with high sucrose concentrations, while more mature embryos can usually develop on a simple medium with low levels of sucrose. The temperature and light requirement is generally species specific and thus its usually regulated to be the within the same temperature requirement as that of its parent with embryos of cool-season crops requiring lower temperatures than those of warm-season crops.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to isolate, {{characterize}} and identify pathogenic microorganisms and funqi from Hylocereus polyrhizous sp. (red dragon fruit) in Kelantan. Pieces of tissues were collected from the lesion margins. After surface <b>disinfestations</b> with 1 % sodium hypochioride for 1 min and rinsing in sterile water three times, the diseased tissues were placed on potato dextrose agar medium plates (PDA) and incubated at 28 °C for 3 days. A dark, fast-growing fungus was isolated from all samples. For identification, single-spore cultures were grown on PDA in an incubator at 28 °C. After 5 days, colonies with dark gray to black aerial mycelium formed. The colonies produce abundant conidia that occurred in arthric chains in aerial mycelium. Macroscopic and microscopic observations were carried out on pure isolates and observations were done based on Morpohology of Fungi (S. R. Misra, 2005). Fungi isolated were Aspergilus, Rhizopus, Penicilium, and Fusarium species. Pathogenicity test for the fungi were done by using modification of bioassay of fungicide — adaption of food poison technique. Three type of fungicide were used, Thiram, Dimethyldicarbonate and Zineb were compared with control PDA which not containing fungicide to determine the percentage of inhibition. Fungicide Thiram show the highest percent of inhibition compare to the Dimethyldicarbonate and Zineb...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCurrent {{pesticides}} such as {{methyl bromide}} are progressively {{removed from the}} market due to harmful residues in food. The stone fruit industries are thus seeking alternatives for postharvest control of insect pests. Microwave and radio frequency methods hold potential for postharvest thermal <b>disinfestations</b> of stone fruits to replace chemical fumigation. Knowledge of dielectric properties is essential for understanding {{the interaction between the}} electromagnetic fields and the target stone fruits and designing treatment beds in industrial applications. Here, we determined the dielectric properties of nectarine, peach, and plum between 10 and 1, 800  MHz over a temperature range of 20 – 60  °C using an impedance analyzer. Our results show that the dielectric constant generally varied between 60 and 75, accounting for changes of 8 – 10  % due to temperature effect. But, the loss factor decreased linearly with frequency on the log scale at all temperatures for three stone fruits. The loss factor of Mediterranean fruit fly, nectarine, peach, and plum increased about 106, 108, 110, and 64  %, respectively, when the sample temperature increased from 20 to 60  °C. The penetration depth in all stone fruits decreased with increasing frequency and temperature. The loss factor ratio at 27  MHz of Mediterranean fruit fly to nectarine, peach, and plum was 1. 65, 1. 66, and 1. 87 at 20  °C, respectively, suggesting potential differential heating between insects and host stone fruits in radio frequency treatments...|$|R
