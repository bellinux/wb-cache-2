40|$|In {{the early}} stages of {{distillation}} process analysis, the residue curve maps are used to check its feasibility. The residue curve map represents the composition that follows the residue in the still of a Rayleigh distillation for several initial conditions. It is demonstrated in the literature by several authors that the compositions followed by a residue curve matches a column composition profile of a packed column operated at <b>infinite</b> <b>reflux</b> flow-rate. In the present work, it is demonstrated that the dimensionless time used to calculate the residue curves corresponds to the number of transfer units by applying mass balances in a section of a packed column operated at <b>infinite</b> <b>reflux</b> flow rate. However, when there is a reaction, the number of moles changes due to the reaction stoichiometry, a different expression is obtained by the residue curves than by the <b>infinite</b> <b>reflux</b> flow rate packed column. It is important to notice that when there is no reaction or the number of stages does not change by the reaction stoichiometry. This expression becomes equal to the Rayleigh distillation expression...|$|E

40|$|Some {{guidelines}} to evaluate distillation columns, considering only basic thermodynamic data and principles, {{are provided in}} this paper. The method allows a first insight to the problem by simple calculations, without requiring column variables to ensure rational use of energy and low environmental impact. The separation system is approached by two complementary ways: minimum and <b>infinite</b> <b>reflux</b> flow rate. The minimum reflux provides the minimum energy requirements, and the <b>infinite</b> <b>reflux</b> provides the feasibility conditions. The difficulty of separation can be {{expressed in terms of}} number of transfer units (NTU). The applicability of the method is not mathematically limited by the number of components in the mixture. Several mixtures are rigorously simulated as illustrative examples, to verify the applicability of the approach. The separation of the mixtures, performed by distillation columns, is feasible if a minimum NTU can be calculated between the distillate and bottom compositions. Once verified the feasibility of the separation, the maximum thermal efficiency depends only on boiling point of bottom and distillate streams. The minimum energy requirements corresponding to the reboiler can be calculated from the maximum thermal efficiency, and the variation of entropy and enthalpy of mixing the distillate and bottom streams...|$|E

Two sequences suitable for ethanol dehydration are compared: The 'direct' and the 'indirect' sequence.

40|$|International audienceFeasibility {{assessment}} of batch homogeneous extractive distillation for {{the separation of}} an A-B mixture feeding entrainer E traditionally relies on the systematic computation of rectifying and extractive composition profile maps under various reflux ratio and entrainer flowrate conditions. This is a well-settled methodology for determining the product sequence and the corresponding column configuration. However, we show that all related literature examples can be simply explained by using thermodynamic insights of residue curve maps, in particular, the unidistribution and univolatility curves. A general feasibility criterion at <b>infinite</b> <b>reflux</b> is proposed and finite reflux operation is also discussed. Illustration is provided for the most common cases, namely the separation with a heavy entrainer of minimum boiling (class 1. 0 - 1 a) and maximum boiling azeotropes (class 1. 0 - 2). New cases not published so far are presented and operating conditions are also discussed. These results demonstrate the obligatory incorporation of the univolatility lines for explaining the unexpected behaviour of some particular ternary mixtures to be separated by the homogeneous extractive distillation proces...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{simplest}} homogeneous azeotropic distillation sequence of industrial relevance, where we add an entrainer to a binary azeotrope {{in order to}} recover both azeotropic constituents as pure products. Despite its apparent simplicity, such distillation columns can exhibit an unusual behavior not observed in zeotropic distillation: - For some mixtures, separation {{as a function of}} reflux goes through a maximum. At <b>infinite</b> <b>reflux,</b> no separation is achieved. - In some cases, achieving the same specifications with a larger number of trays requires a larger reflux. - In some cases the only feasible separation yields the intermediate component as a pure distillate while the bottom product contains the light and heavy components. - In some cases the only feasible separation yields the intermediate component as a pure bottom product while the distillate contains the light and Hay components. While these unusual features can be regarded as curiosities, they are essential for proper entrainer selection and design. When designing a homogeneous azeotropic sequence which separates a binary azeotrope into two pure products, we must first choose the entrainer. Currently available entrainer selection criteria, are inadequate: They contradict one another and often lead to incorrect conclusions. Indeed, for a minimum boiling azeotrope, the existing entrainer selection rules state that, one should use a high boiling component that introduces no additional azeotrope (Benedict & Rubin 1945), an intermediate boiling component that introduces no additional azeotrope (Hoffman 1964), a component which introduces no distillation boundary between the azeotropic constituents (Doherty & Caldarola 1985), and either a low boiling component that introduces no additional azeotrope or a component that introduces new minimum boiling azeotropes (Stichlmair, Fair & Bravo 1989). By taking advantage of the curious aforementioned features, {{we have been able to}} understand when these criteria, are correct, or incorrect. In the case of homogeneous azeotropic distillation, separability at finite reflex and at <b>infinite</b> <b>reflux</b> are not equivalent and must be examined separately. By analyzing in detail the profiles of columns operated at <b>infinite</b> <b>reflux,</b> we have: - shown that a binary azeotrope can be separated with only one distillation column. We present a necessary and sufficient condition that identifies such situations; - found a necessary and sufficient condition for separability in a two-column sequence. When separation is feasible, this condition indicates the flowsheet of the corresponding separation sequence; - shown that separation is very often feasible in a three-column separation if the two azeotropic constituents are located in adjacent distillation regions. Then, we examine two situations where separation is feasible at finite reflux but not at infinite reflex. Finally, we present practical solutions (in the case of entrainers that add no azeotropes to two problems of industrial relevance: Given a binary azeotrope that we want to separate into pure components, and a set of candidate entrainers, how do we determine which one is the best? Also, for each of these entrainers, what is the flowsheet of the feasible separation sequence(s) ? We obtain these solutions by analyzing in detail the mechanisms by which heavy, intermediate and light entrainers make separation feasible, using the new notions of equivolatility curves, of isovolatility curves and of local volatility order. We show that the second question finds an easy solution from the volatility order diagram. This analysis shows that a good entrainer is a component that "breaks" the azeotrope easily (i. e., even when its concentration is small) and yields high relative volatilities between the two azeotropic consituents. Because these attributes can be easily identified in an entrainer from the equivolatility curve diagram of the ternary mixture azeotropic component # 1 - azeotropic component # 2 - entrainer, we can easily compare entrainers by examining the corresponding equivolatility curve diagrams. We also demonstrate the validity and limits of this method with numerous examples. ...|$|E

Using an industrial pilot column without an automatic control system, they confirmed the existence of two stable steady states for the ternary homogeneous system methanol-methyl butyrate-toluene. That is, two different column profiles occurred for the same operating parameters, feed flow rate, and feed composition. In this paper, experiments for the same ternary system are described which show the existence of a third unstable steady state. The unstable steady state is stabilized with PI control.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{continuous}} extractive distillation of minimum and maximum boiling azeotropic mixtures A-B {{with a heavy}} or a light entrainer E, intending to assess its feasibility based on thermodynamic insights. The ternary mixtures belong to the common 1. 0 - 1 a and 1. 0 - 2 class ternary diagrams, each with two sub-cases depending on the univolatility line location. The column has three sections, rectifying, extractive and stripping. Differential equations are derived for each section composition, depending on operating parameters: distillate product purity and recovery, reflux ratio R and entrainer – feed flow rate ratio FE/F for the heavy case; bottom product purity and recovery, reboil ratio and entrainer – feed flow rate ratio for the light entrainer case. For the case with a heavy entrainer fed as a boiling liquid above the main feed, the feasible product and operating parameters R and FE/F ranges are assessed under <b>infinite</b> <b>reflux</b> ratio conditions by using the general feasibility criterion enounced by Rodriguez-Donis et al. (Ind. Eng. Chem. Res, 2009, 48 (7), 3544 – 3559). For the 1. 0 - 1 a class, there exists a minimum entrainer - feed flow rate ratio to recover the product, and also a minimum reflux ratio. The minimum entrainer - feed flow rate ratio is higher for the continuous process than for the batch because of the additional requirement in continuous mode that the stripping profile intersects with the extractive profile. For the 1. 0 - 2 class both A and B can be distillated. For one of them there exists a maximum entrainer - feed flow rate ratio. The continuous process also has a minimum entrainer - feed flow rate ratio limit for a given feasible reflux ratio. For the case with a light entrainer fed as saturated vapor below the main feed, the feasible product and operating parameters S and FE/F ranges are assessed under <b>infinite</b> <b>reflux</b> ratio conditions by using the general feasibility criterion enounced by Rodriguez-Donis et al. (Ind. Eng. Chem. Res, 2012, 51, 4643 – 4660), Compared to the heavy entrainer case, the main product {{is removed from the}} column bottom. Similar results are obtained for the 1. 0 - 1 a and 1. 0 - 2 class mixtures whether the entrainer is light or heavy. With a light entrainer, the batch insight about the process feasibility holds for the stripping and extractive sections. Now, an additional constraint in continuous mode comes from the necessary intersection between the rectifying and the extractive sections. This work validates the proposed methodology for assessing the feasibility of continuous extractive distillation processes and enables to compare entrainers in terms of minimum reflux ratio and minimum entrainer feed flow rate rati...|$|E

Due to the great complexity of the process the mathematical model is simplified according to the ∞/∞ analysis assumptions, i. e. columns of infinite length operated at the <b>infinite</b> <b>reflux.</b> The objective function is the overall process energy requirements that in previous studies was approximated to the overall process distillate flow rate.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{multiplicity}} in heterogeneous azeotropic distillation sequences is studied. Two sequences, suitable for ethanol dehydration, {{are treated as}} sample problems and compared. As a basis the #infinity#/#infinity# analysis method (Petlyuk, F. B.; Avet'yan, V. S. Theor. Found. Chem. Eng. 1971, 5, 499 - 507; Bekiaris, N.; Meski, G. A.; Morari, M. Ind. Eng. Chem.

The bifurcation diagrams are very different for the two sequences despite their similar structures. In particular, it is predicted that output multiplicity of the single azeotropic column, as recently experimentally verified by Mueller and Marquardt (Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 1997 a, 36, 5410 - 5418), can induce output multiplicity of one sequence. It is further predicted that output multiplicity can be avoided by the choice of a different sequence structure. Furthermore, #infinity#/#infinity# analysis predicts state multiplicity in both heterogeneous azeotropic distillation sequences. This phenomenon in the #infinity#/#infinity# case is also analyzed and it is shown that state multiplicity in heterogeneous distillation sequences can be induced either by the corresponding single column behavior as reported by Gani and Jorgensen (Comput. Chem. Eng. 1994, 18, 55) or by closing the sequence. The predicted bifurcation diagrams and multiplicities are substantiated through rigorous simulation of column sequences operating at finite reflux and with a finite number of stages. Finally, the implications of the thermodynamics including the liquid-liquid plait point position are demonstrated to be important for obtaining reliable predictions. (orig.) Special print from: Ind.

40|$|A novel {{approach}} {{for the design}} and synthesis of membrane separation systems has been developed. The theory is shown to be applicable to both batch and continuous membrane operations, and has been formulated {{in such a way}} that it is valid for any type of membrane. In this thesis, however, only vapour permeation and pervaporation membranes are incorporated for illustration purposes. The method, which employs a graphical technique, allows one to calculate and visualise the change in composition of the retentate. An integral part of the approach was the derivation of the Membrane Residue Curve Map (M-RCM), and the related differential material balance which describes it. By definition, this plot shows the change, in time, of the retentate composition in a batch still. However, it has been shown that the M-RCM is applicable to conventional continuously-operated membrane units, as well as <b>infinite</b> <b>reflux</b> membrane columns. Finite reflux columns and cascades have been examined by using column sections (CS) : any column, or arrangement, no matter how complex, can be broken down into smaller units, namely CS. The development of the Difference Point Equation (DPE) for non-constant flow allowed one to generate, and interpret, profiles for individual CS’s, which can ultimately be connected to form a membrane column arrangement. The profiles, which are more complex than those obtained in the M-RCM, exhibit a unique behavior. Since there is varying flow, the reflux is continually changing, orientating the profile so as to seek a stable node that is “mobile”. Thus, the movement of CS profile is dictated by the location and direction of the pinch point locus. Finally, having membrane permeators examined in an analogous manner to other separation methods, allows for easy synthesis and design of combinations of different processes. Hybrid distillation-membrane systems are analyzed by incorporating CS’s and the appropriate DPE’s which describe each. Investigating the arrangement as a thermally-coupled column introduces a novel way of synthesizing hybrids. Regions of feasibility, which are dictated by the relevant pinch point loci of each separation method, are ultimately sought...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this contribution, a {{sequential}} and hierarchical {{approach for}} the feasibility analysis and the preliminary design of reactive distillation columns is extended to systems involving vapour phase chemical reaction and is successfully {{applied to the}} HI vapour phase decomposition to produce H 2. The complex phase and physico chemical behaviour of the quaternary HI-H 2 -I 2 -H 2 O system {{is represented by the}} Neumann's thermodynamic model and instantaneous vapour phase chemical equilibrium is assumed. Then, from minimal information concerning the physicochemical properties of the system, three successive steps lead to the design of the unit and the specification of its operating conditions: the feasibility analysis, the synthesis and the design step. First, the analysis of reactive condensation curve map method (rCCM), assuming infinite internal liquid and vapour flow rate and <b>infinite</b> <b>reflux</b> ratio, is used to assess the feasibility of the process. It determines the column structure and estimates the attainable compositions. These results are used as inputs data for the synthesis step. Based on the boundary value design method (BVD), considering finite internal liquid and vapour flow rate and finite reflux ratio while neglecting all thermal effects and assuming a constant heat of vaporisation, the synthesis step provides more precise information about the process configuration (minimum reflux ratio, number of theoretical stages, localisation and number of reactive plates, position of the feed plate). Finally, the BVD method results are used to initialise rigorous simulations, based on an equilibrium stage model with energy balance, to estimate the reflux ratio taking into account thermal effect on the process. The resulting design configuration consists in a single feed and entirely reactive distillation column. The column operates under a pressure of 22 bars. The feed of the reactive distillation column, coming from the Bunsen reaction section [xHI= 0. 10; xI 2 = 0. 39 xH 2 O= 0. 51], is at its boiling temperature. The residue consists in pure iodine. Water and produced hydrogen are recovered at the distillate.
