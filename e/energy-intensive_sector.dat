40|$|The present paper applies a two-sector two-factor {{model to}} analyze {{a variety of}} energy tax reforms that {{discriminate}} {{in favor of the}} energy-intensive export sector. As a result, all scenarios with exemptions reduce energy less than the non-discriminating textbook version. In one scenario that exemplifies typical attributes of the tax reform in Sweden, even an increase in total energy use is theoretically possible. This is due to a structural adjustment resulting from a substitution of the energy-intensive for the labor-intensive commodity. Moreover, simulation results show that the factor substitution effect in the <b>energy-intensive</b> <b>sector</b> is crucial to the reduction of energy. ...|$|E

In this paper, the contribution of tourism to electricity consumption is investigated using the case study of the Balearic Islands (Spain). Using a conventional daily electricity demand model, including data for daily stocks of tourists, the impact of different tourist policy measures on electricity loads is also investigated.

30|$|The {{construction}} industry is an <b>energy-intensive</b> <b>sector</b> rapidly growing in both {{developed and developing}} countries [1]. At global level building construction consumes 24  % of the raw materials extracted from the lithosphere [2]. High levels of emissions from the building industry {{are the result of}} the energy consumed during the extraction, processing and transportation of materials [3]. According to the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report, in 2010 buildings accounted for 19  % of the energy-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (including electricity) [4]. The demand for energy in the life cycle of buildings is both direct and indirect. Direct energy is used for construction, operation, renovation, and demolition, while indirect energy is consumed by a building for the production of the materials used in its construction and technical installations [5]. To reduce this demand, the use of renewable materials, e.g., wood, represents an effective solution [6 – 8].|$|E

Despite the positive impacts of the cork industry, this is an <b>energy-intensive</b> <b>sector,</b> with a strong need for process heat. Therefore, a careful management of heat consumption is important to minimize its impacts. Being Portugal the world leader in the cork industry, this paper characterizes the Portuguese cork industry and gathers information on the production processes of cork products, with special focus on the generation of residues, heat consuming processes, heat production technologies and energy sources. The study relies on a compilation of data from several sources: statistic offices, industrial companies and associations and scientific literature. Cork powder is the main waste of the cork industry.

The dataset allows for a comparison with 18 other OECD countries. A key feature of our analysis is that we combine a cross-country perspective {{with a high level}} of sectoral detail, covering 49 sectors. Particularly innovative is our evaluation of energy intensity developments in a wide range of Service sectors. We find that across sectors energy intensity levels in the Netherlands on average decreased only marginally, and increased in Services. This performance is in general worse than the OECD average, especially between 1987 and 1995. Changes in the sectoral composition of the economy play an important role in explaining aggregate trends. In the Manufacturing sector about half of the efficiency improvements were undone by a shift towards a more energy-intensive industry structure, while in the Service sector about one-third of the decrease in efficiency was undone by a shift towards a less <b>energy-intensive</b> <b>sector</b> structure...|$|E

This paper presents a survey of cogeneration plants installed in the Italian {{pulp and paper}} industry from 1986 to 2010 including the technologies installed and the size and the timeline of installations. The work, carried out in cooperation with ASSOCARTA (the trade organization of Italian pulp, paper and board manufacturers), examines 61 cogeneration plants, 14 of them in detail. The analysis involves 673. 5 MWe of installed electrical power, accounting for 75. 7 % of the sector (890 MWe); the average plant size in the sample is 11. 1 MWe, the Italian sector average being 18. 2 MWe. Gas turbines coupled with heat recovery steam generators are the commonest technology in the low power range, with 35 plants found between 1 and 8 MWe. If combined cycles (commonly installed above 8 MWe) are considered, the cogeneration plants using gas turbines are 55 / 61. Our data show that from 1986 to 2010 nearly all plants worked with a positive PES (primary energy saving) index, using less primary energy compared to separate production of electrical and thermal energy. Only two plants had a slightly negative PES index, but the price of electricity and natural gas was such that they made a profit anyway...|$|E

40|$|The {{life cycle}} of {{materials}} like steel, aluminium and paper causes pressure on the environment. Particularly the cracking and melting processes used to convert raw materials cost considerable energy. At European level the production and processing of materials contribute about 25 % of the total greenhouse gas emissions. This contribution is even higher in the Netherlands, with its relatively <b>energy-intensive</b> <b>sector</b> structure. l pressure from material streams, {{it is important to}} have insight in the physical production trends in the base industries. Indeed energy use and emissions of substances are coupled to quantities of materials needed for physical production. This was reason enough for the Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis (CPB), in cooperation with the RIVM, to design the STREAM model. STREAM will allow these institutes to discover how at national, European and global levels developments in the economy and environmental policy influence the physical volume location and input efficiency (labour, capital and energy) in the production of materials. STREAM comprises the materials steel, aluminium, paper, petrochemical products(monomers, polymers and solvents) and artificial fertilizers. It models developments in both production with primary raw materials and production with recycled materials. calibrated on monitoring data over the period, 1960 to 1993. From a general uncertainty and sensitivity analysis we concluded that the most important uncertainties and sensitivities of the Dutch ' block' in the model were to be found in the current import and export elasticities. These indicate for example that a rise in the cost price of 1 % in the Netherlands with respect to abroad would result in an export drop of 6 - 8 %. In view of the uncertainties about the precise level of the effects, the model results give - mostly indicative - information on trend-like developments. the next decades, STREAM calculates a further growth in the demand for and the production of base materials. The extent of the growth varies, depending on the material in question. The demand for materials from basic chemistry, like polymers and solvents, and the demand for aluminium will grow the most rapidly, while the Western European production of artificial fertilizers will stagnate. The growth in production of base materials in the Netherlands, mostly for export, keeps pace with the rest of Western Europe. Although the energy efficiency of the production of base materials continues, partly because of the increasing contribution of secondary production, it falls behind growth in production. The overall industrial energy use and the associated CO 2 emission will therefore rise in this scenario. ial sector, amounting to 1 - 2 percent of the total production costs, are not demonstrably higher than in the surrounding (competitive) countries. The future costs indicated in the environmental policy now set down, either do not, or barely, seem to affect the industry's competitive position. This policy will lead to a (further) drop in industrial emissions, except for CO 2; however, emission targets for 2010 remain largely unattainable. Calculation variants with a stricter environmental policy further illustrate the 'tension' between environmental policy on the one hand and loss of the competitive power on the other...|$|E

40|$|The {{adoption}} of domestic emissions trading schemes (ETS) can impose {{a heavy burden}} on energy-intensive industries. In particular, energy-intensive industries competing with foreign competitors could lose their international edge. Although the abatement of carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions in industrialized countries entails the reduction of their energy-intensive production, a corresponding increase {{in the production of}} energy-intensive goods in countries without CO 2 regulations may lead to carbon “leakage. ” This paper examines the effects of various allocation methods for granting emissions permits in the Japanese ETS on the economy and CO 2 emissions using a multiregional and multisector computable general equilibrium model. Specifically, we apply the Fischer and Fox (2007) model to the Japanese economy to address carbon leakage and competitiveness issues. We compare auction schemes, grandfathering schemes, and output-based allocation (OBA) schemes. We further extend the model by examining a combination of auctions and OBA. Though the auction scheme is found to be the best in terms of macroeconomic impacts (welfare and GDP effects), the leakage rate is high and the harm to <b>energy-intensive</b> <b>sectors</b> can be significant. OBA causes less leakage and damage to <b>energy-intensive</b> <b>sectors,</b> but the macroeconomic impact is undesirable. Considering all three effects—leakage, competitiveness, and macroeconomics—we find that combinations of auctions and OBA (with gratis allocations solely to <b>energy-intensive,</b> trade-exposed <b>sectors)</b> are desirable. climate change, emissions trading, emissions permit allocations, output-based allocation, auction, grandfathering, international competitiveness, carbon leakage, CGE analysis...|$|R
