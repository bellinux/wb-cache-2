The orientational structure factor is expanded in terms of symmetry-adapted surface harmonics. The expansion coefficients are calculated from theory and compared with experiment Their temperature evolution is studied <b>in</b> <b>the</b> disordered phase at the 260 K transitions and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordered</b> phase. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordered</b> phase, new results from high-resolution neutron powder diffraction are given. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> disordered phase, space group Fm $($) over bar$$ 3 m, the reflections have A(1 g) symmetry; <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordered</b> phase, space group Pa $$($) over bar 3, reflections of T- 2 g symmetry appear and <b>in</b> addition <b>the</b> A(1 g) reflections are renormalized.
