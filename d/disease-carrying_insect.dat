5000|$|In the {{developing}} world where the vector-borne disease dengue fever is endemic, temephos is widely used and applied by {{both private and public}} pest control in areas of standing water where the Aedes aegypti mosquito breeds {{in order to reduce the}} population of this <b>disease-carrying</b> <b>insect.</b> [...] Temephos is also used in the Guinea worm eradication program to kill water fleas that carry guinea worm larvae.|$|E
40|$|Chagas disease—the {{third most}} common {{parasitic}} {{infection in the}} world—affects approximately 7. 5 million people, mostly in Latin America. Population mobility between Latin America {{and the rest of}} the world has led to increasing detection of Chagas disease in the United States, Europe, Japan, and other parts of the world in the last decade. Those living in poverty, including in the United States and Mexico, are at risk of Chagas disease infection due to poor quality housing that leads to infestation by the <b>disease-carrying</b> <b>insect,</b> the kissing bug. The actual extent of the disease burden in Mexico, where the disease is endemic, and the United States is unclear due to limited diagnosis and surveillance. To help reduce outbreaks, the US and Mexican governments should implement surveillance programs, initiate vector 1 control programs (as needed), increase awareness among health care providers, and fund research for the development of Chagas vaccines and treatments...|$|E

50|$|Tree paint {{may help}} to prevent <b>disease-carrying</b> <b>insects</b> from {{entering}} a wounded tree. Studies have shown that wound dressing must be applied immediately after damage or pruning. Even a delay of three days can be too long.|$|R
50|$|Warming {{and other}} climate changes could expand the habitat and {{infectiousness}} of <b>disease-carrying</b> <b>insects,</b> thus increasing {{the potential for}} transmission of diseases such as malaria and dengue. Warmer temperatures could increase the incidence of Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases in West Virginia, because populations of ticks, and their rodent hosts, could increase under warmer temperatures and increased vegetation.|$|R
50|$|Warming {{and other}} climate changes could expand the habitat and {{infectivity}} of <b>disease-carrying</b> <b>insects.</b> Mosquitoes in Idaho can carry malaria, and some can carry western equine encephalitis, {{which can be}} lethal or cause neurological damage. Warmer temperatures couldincrease the incidence of Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases in Idaho, because populations of ticks, and their rodent hosts, could increase under warmer temperatures and increased vegetation.|$|R
50|$|Dr Vichitr Chaiyaporn, {{the founder}} of this museum, {{collected}} parasites from his patients. They are displayed here with a presentation of their life cycle and natural habitat. A wide variety of worms, ranging from {{those that are not}} {{visible to the naked eye}} (protozoa), to those up to a metre-long (flat worms) are on display, in addition to information about types of food, cooking processes favouring growth of the parasites, <b>disease-carrying</b> <b>insects,</b> venomous animals, and preventive measures.|$|R
50|$|Technological {{advances}} during World War II accelerated post-war {{innovation in}} all aspects of agriculture, resulting in large advances in mechanization (including large-scale irrigation), fertilization, and pesticides. In particular, two chemicals that had been produced in quantity for warfare, were repurposed for peace-time agricultural uses. Ammonium nitrate, used in munitions, became an abundantly cheap source of nitrogen. And a range of new pesticides appeared: DDT, which had been used to control <b>disease-carrying</b> <b>insects</b> around troops, became a general insecticide, launching the era of widespread pesticide use.|$|R
5000|$|Spiroplasma citri is {{transmissible}} {{through several}} insect vectors, namely the beet leafhopper. One effective measure against the beet leafhopper is planting trap plants, such as sugar beets, that the insect vector favor {{but are not}} susceptible to citrus stubborn disease nearby, in attempt to draw the <b>disease-carrying</b> <b>insects</b> away from the citrus plants. [...] To further increase the effectiveness a chemical component can be added by spraying insecticides on the trap plants, eliminating the insect vector and preventing the bacteria from reaching the citrus crop.|$|R
50|$|The East had 517,198 {{inhabitants}} in 1987, and {{it remains}} the most sparsely populated of Cameroon's ten provinces. The bulk of the territory has a population density of less than five persons/km². This is mostly {{a result of the}} area's thick forests, which inhibit settlement and support <b>disease-carrying</b> <b>insects</b> such as mosquitoes and blackflies. These factors also make the East an unattractive target for development by both non-governmental organisations and the Cameroonian government, a fact that has only further prevented larger numbers of people from settling in the region.|$|R
50|$|The {{site was}} deep enough water for ships to dock {{but was also}} easily defendable. But despite the {{defensive}} advantages of that location against Spanish attacks, the low and marshy site at Jamestown proved a very poor choice in many other ways. More than five years of fragile existence, <b>disease-carrying</b> <b>insects</b> and high mortality rates followed including the Starving Time of 1609-10 when over 80% of the 500 colonists perished before {{the future of the}} Virginia Colony began to appear more promising. The change came about with the just-in-time arrival of a new Governor, Lord Delaware, and a new colonist with a successful business idea named John Rolfe.|$|R
5000|$|Population {{increase}} {{over the last two}} decades, at least in the United States, has also been accompanied by a shift to an increase in urban areas from rural areas, which concentrates the demand for water into certain areas, and puts stress on the fresh water supply from industrial and human contaminants. [...] Urbanization causes overcrowding and increasingly unsanitary living conditions, especially in developing countries, which in turn exposes an increasingly number of people to disease. About 79% of the world's population is in developing countries, which lack access to sanitary water and sewer systems, giving rises to disease and deaths from contaminated water and increased numbers of <b>disease-carrying</b> <b>insects.</b>|$|R
5|$|Animals bolstered morale at the front, {{due to the}} soldiers' {{affection for}} them. Some {{recruitment}} posters from World War I showcased the partnership between horse and man in attempts to gain more recruits. Despite the boost in morale, horses {{could also be a}} health hazard for the soldiers, mainly because of the difficulty of maintaining high levels of hygiene around horses, which was especially noted in camps in Egypt. Horse manure was commonplace in the battle and staging areas on several fronts, creating breeding grounds for <b>disease-carrying</b> <b>insects.</b> Manure was supposed to be buried, but fast-moving battle conditions often made this impossible. Sanitation officers were responsible for the burial of horse carcasses, among other duties.|$|R
40|$|Insect nicotinic {{acetylcholine}} (nACh) receptors are molecular {{targets of}} insecticides such as neonicotinoids {{that are used}} to control <b>disease-carrying</b> <b>insects</b> and agricultural pests. To date, several insect nACh receptor subunits have been identified, indicating different nACh receptor subtypes and pharmacological profiles. Because of the difficulty in expressing functional insect nACh receptors in heterologous systems, new research tools are needed. Studies on insects resistant to the insecticide imidacloprid and on laboratory-generated hybrid and chimaeric nACh receptors in vitro have provided information about the molecular basis of receptor diversity, neonicotinoid resistance and selectivity. Additionally, recent results indicate that the sensitivity of insect nACh receptors to imidacloprid can be modulated by intracellular phosphorylation mechanisms, which offers a new approach to studying insect nACh receptor pharmacology...|$|R
40|$|Great {{progress}} has been made in the field of insect olfaction in recent years. Receptors, neurons, and circuits have been defined in considerable detail, and the mechanisms by which they detect, encode, and process sensory stimuli are being unraveled. We provide a guide to recent progress in the field, with special attention to advances made in the genetic model organism Drosophila. We highlight key questions that merit additional investigation. We then present our view of how recent advances may be applied to the control of <b>disease-carrying</b> <b>insects</b> such as mosquitoes, which transmit disease to hundreds of millions of people each year. We suggest how progress in defining the basic mechanisms of insect olfaction may lead to means of disrupting host-seeking and other olfactory behaviors, thereby reducing the transmission of deadly diseases...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the change of popular opinion of the {{pesticide}} DDT in the United States between the years of 1945 - 1972. One of the primary uses of DDT was against malaria-carrying mosquitoes, which it eradicated before being banned in 1972. A key problem with DDT, despite saving many lives by killing <b>disease-carrying</b> <b>insects,</b> is that it stores in the fatty cells of animals (including humans) that ingest it, rendering it dangerous in the long term. Current scholarship {{focuses on the}} role of Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring in bringing the issue of the safety of pesticide use, specifically DDT, from a private discussion among scientists and legislatures to a public forum. Unlike previous studies, this one looks at the archives of the widely-circulated magazines LIFE and Popular Science to assess public opinion of DDT...|$|R
40|$|Greenhouse gas (GHG) {{emissions}} trap solar {{heat in the}} atmosphere, increasing {{global temperature}} by an estimated 1. 4 degrees. Increases in GHG emissions resulting largely from energy use have led to more heat being trapped in the atmosphere, leading to global warming. Major impacts of global warming include rising sea levels, higher temperatures and increased global migration of <b>disease-carrying</b> <b>insects.</b> While there is continuing scientific discussion regarding how quickly the earth’s atmosphere will warm and when the adverse global warming impacts will occur, most scientists believe that GHG emissions must be reduced 50 - 80 percent in the next 50 years to minimize adverse impacts. Carbon dioxide (CO 2) accounts for over 80 percent of GHG emissions, and is the principal focus of GHG reduction programs. The United States, with 5 percent of the world’s population, generates 25 percent of global GHG emissions. The U. S. has recently been overtaken by China as the largest generator of GHGs. Electricity (generated from coal-fired power plants) {{is second only to}} deforestation as a global source of GHG emissions. One way to reduce global warming is to move to cleaner sources of electricity, such as solar energy and wind energy...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{ascertain}} whether patients with eczema {{are more prone to}} being bitten by insects than those with other dermatoses, data were collected by interview and questionnaire from 496 patients attending the outpatient department of a hospital in Sydney and a general dermatological practice in Geelong, Australia. Of the 93 patients with eczema 65 % claimed they were prone to insect bite and that they were bitten in preference to other people when in a group, compared with 17 % of the 403 patients with other chronic dermatoses. Similar proportions of both groups (approximately 50 %) had used insect repellents. Excluding those with eczema 30 % of the 149 patients with a family history of atopy claimed they were prone to being bitten by insects compared with 8 % of the 254 patients without a family history of atopy. There was no difference in the prevalence of eczema or family history of atopy between men and women, but more women felt themselves to be susceptible to insect bites than men. There is evidence that patients with eczema and those with a family history of atopy are prone to being bitten by insects. Further confirmatory work, perhaps using volunteers and mosquitoes, is indicated. However, patients with severe eczema or a family history of atopy should take care when travelling to areas where <b>disease-carrying</b> <b>insects</b> are prevalent...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives: RNA {{interference}} is a process, {{in which}} a molecule of double-stranded RNA prevents {{the expression of a}} particular gene and leads to its silencing. Application of this technology in the control of <b>disease-carrying</b> <b>insects</b> is rising in agriculture and medical sciences. Also, its application in control of insect-borne diseases could be considered as a new, important, and effective approach. In this article, it was attempted to study the mechanisms of RNA interference, routs of its delivery to insects, as well as its application in genetic control of disease vector insects. Methods: In this study, 71 indexed articles in databases, such as Pubmed, SID, Scopus, Science direct, and Google scholar, were used. Results: dsRNA could be delivered to insect body through three routes of oral, injection, and Impregnation. The mechanism of dsRNA entrance into the cells has considerable effect on the success and applicability of this technique. Identification of host-parasite relationship in the insect body is one of the important applications of RNAi in medical entomology. Conclusion: Although, there is a considerable number of researches on RNAi in the agricultural pests field, studies on insect vectors of human diseases have been mostly in-vivo. However, application of RNAi is suggested as a new, safe and applicable approach, alone or along with other methods. Certainly, further researches in this field can pave the way for enforcement measures in the control of disease vectors, especially Zika, dengue fever, and malaria in the not so distant future...|$|R
5000|$|In 1848, {{the opening}} of the Illinois and Michigan Canal allowed {{shipping}} from the Great Lakes through Chicago to the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico. The first rail line to Chicago, the Galena & Chicago Union Railroad was completed the same year. Chicago would go on to become the transportation hub of the United States with its road, rail, water and later air connections. Chicago also became home to national retailers offering catalog shopping such as Montgomery Ward and Sears, Roebuck and Company, which used the transportation lines to ship all over the nation.By the 1850s, the construction of railroads made Chicago a major hub; over 30 lines entered the city. The main lines from the East ended in Chicago, and those oriented to the West began in Chicago, so by 1860 the city became the nation's trans-shipment and warehousing center. Factories were created, most famously the harvester factory opened in 1847 by Cyrus Hall McCormick. It was a processing center for natural resource commodities extracted in the West. The Wisconsin forests supported the millwork and lumber business; the Illinois hinterland provided the wheat. Hundreds of thousands of hogs and cattle were shipped to Chicago for slaughter, preserving in salt, and transport to eastern markets. By 1870 refrigerated cars allowed the shipping of fresh meat to eastern cities. The prairie bog nature of the area provided a fertile ground for <b>disease-carrying</b> <b>insects.</b> In springtime Chicago was so muddy from the high water that horses could scarcely move. Comical signs proclaiming [...] "Fastest route to China" [...] or [...] "No Bottom Here" [...] were placed to warn people of the mud.|$|R
5000|$|Warming {{and other}} climate changes could expand the habitat and {{infectiousness}} of <b>disease-carrying</b> <b>insects,</b> thus increasing {{the potential for}} transmission of diseases such as malaria and dengue (“break bone”) fever. Warmer temperatures could increase the incidence of Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases in West Virginia, because populations of ticks, and their rodent hosts, could increase under warmer temperatures and increased vegetation. Lower streamflows and lake levels {{in the summer and}} fall could affect the dependability of surface water supplies, particularly since many of the streams in West Virginia have low flows in the summer. Hay yields could increase by about 30% as a result of climate change, leading to changes in acres farmed and production. Farmed acres could remain constant or could decrease by as much as 30% in response to changes in prices, for example, possible decreases in hay prices. In areas where richer soils are prevalent, southern pines could increase their range and density, and in areas with poorer soils, which are more common in West Virginia’s forests, scrub oaks of little commercial value (e.g., post oak and blackjack oak) could increase their range. As a result, the character of forests in West Virginia could change. The state of West Virginia is 97% forested, and much of this cover is in high-elevation areas. These areas contain some of the last remaining stands of red spruce, which are seriously threatened by acid rain and could be further stressed by changing climate. Given a sufficient change in climate, these spruce forests could be substantially reduced, or could disappear. Higher-than-normal winter temperatures could boost temperatures inside cave bat roosting sites, which has been shown to cause higher mortality due to increased winter body weight loss in endangered Indiana bats (e.g., an increase of [...] during winter hibernation has been associated with a 42% increase in the rate of body mass loss).|$|R
