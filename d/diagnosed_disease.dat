The Sage International Encyclopedia of Travel and Tourism offers an expanded definition, "Wellness tourism is purpose-driven travel encompassing discovery, connectivity, fulfillment, and transformation through positive engagement with people." [...] While wellness tourism is often correlated with medical tourism because health interests motivate the traveler, wellness tourists are proactive in seeking to improve or maintain health and quality of life, often focusing on prevention, while medical tourists generally travel reactively to receive treatment for a <b>diagnosed</b> <b>disease</b> or condition.|$|E

50|$|Globally coeliac {{diseases}} affects between 1 in 100 and 1 in 170 people. Rates, however, vary {{between different}} regions of the world from as few as 1 in 300 to as many as 1 in 40. In the United States it is thought to affect between 1 in 1750 (defined as clinical disease including dermatitis herpetiformis with limited digestive tract symptoms) to 1 in 105 (defined by presence of IgA TG in blood donors). Due to variable signs and symptoms it is believed that about 85% of people affected are undiagnosed. The percentage of people with clinically <b>diagnosed</b> <b>disease</b> (symptoms prompting diagnostic testing) is 0.05-0.27% in various studies. However, population studies from parts of Europe, India, South America, Australasia and the USA (using serology and biopsy) indicate that the percentage of people with the disease may be between 0.33 and 1.06% in children (but 5.66% in one study of children of the predisposed Sahrawi people) and 0.18-1.2% in adults. Among those in primary care populations who report gastrointestinal symptoms, the rate of coeliac disease is about 3%. The rate amongst adult blood donors in Iran, Israel, Syria and Turkey is 0.60%, 0.64%, 1.61% and 1.15%, respectively.|$|E

50|$|It is an unsolved {{mystery that}} the Schindler couple after 1880 {{did not have}} any more children. After all they lived {{together}} for another twelve years, and Anna Schindler was only 23 years old at the birth of her second child. In her unpublished memoirs (Der schimmernde Weg, 1930) Alma Mahler hints that her father suffered from syphilis and that was the cause of sister Grethe's later <b>diagnosed</b> <b>disease</b> Dementia praecox (which from a medical point of view is sheer nonsense). During the months following Alma's birth we know from Schindler's Diary that he was refused admission to the bed of his wife, and in sheer despair he might have visited a brothel and had contracted syphilis. Although later in life Mahler characterized her upbringing as privileged, many biographies recount that the family to have been only moderately successful. After her father's death (1892), her mother married her late husband's former pupil, Carl Moll, who was a co-founder of the Vienna Secession. Alma Schindler and her sister Grethe began taking piano lessons at an early age from Miss Adele Mandlick (later married Radnitzky, 1864-1932). Both girls, respectively nine and eight years old, appeared in public {{for the first time on}} 10 April 1890 at a student's concert in Vienna, and eventually trained under Zemlinsky. Her father died when she was 13 years old.|$|E
5000|$|NSRED {{is closely}} related to Night Eating Syndrome (NES) {{except for the fact that}} those {{suffering}} from NES are completely awake and aware of their eating and bingeing at night while those suffering from NSRED are sleeping and unaware of what they are doing. NES is primarily considered an eating disorder while NSRED is primarily considered a parasomnia; however, both are a combination of parasomnia and eating disorders since those suffering from NES usually have insomnia or difficulty sleeping and those suffering from NSRED experience symptoms similar to binge eating. Some even argue over whether NES and NSRED are the same or distinct disorders. [...] Even though there have been debates over these two disorders, specialists have examined them to try to determine the differences. Dr. J. Winkelman noted several features of the two disorders that were similar, but he gave one important factor that make these disorders different. In his article Sleep-Related Eating Disorder and Night Eating Syndrome: Sleep Disorders, Eating Disorders, Or both, Dr. Winkelman said, “Both disorders involve nearly nightly binging at multiple nocturnal awakenings, defined as excess calorie intake or loss of control over consumption.” [...] He also reported that both disorders have a common occurrence of approximately one to five percent of adults, have been predominantly found in women, with a young adult onset, have a chronic course, have a primary morbidity of weight gain, sleep disruption, and shame over loss of control over food intake, have familial bases, and have been observed to have comorbid depression and daytime eating disorders. However, Winkelman said, “The most prominent cited distinction between NES and SRED is the level of consciousness during nighttime eating episodes.” Therefore, these two disorders are extremely similar with only one distinction between them. This information provided by Dr. Winkelman shows how doctors and psychologists have difficulty differentiating between NES and NSRED, but the distinction of a person’s level of consciousness is what doctors chiefly rely on to make a diagnosis. One mistake that is often made is the misdiagnosis of NSRED for NES. [...] However, even though NSRED is not a commonly known and <b>diagnosed</b> <b>disease,</b> many people suffer from it in differing ways while doctors work to find a treatment that works for everyone; several studies have been done on NSRED, such as the one conducted by Schenk and Mahowald. [...] These studies, in turn, provide the basic information on this disorder including the symptoms, behaviors, and possible treatments that doctors are using today.|$|E
40|$|An {{adequate}} {{approach to}} reducing school absenteeism {{should focus on}} medical absenteeism as {{this is the most}} prevalent form of school absenteeism. The objective {{of this study is to}} explore the health condition of pre-vocational secondary students with extensive medical absenteeism from a biopsychosocial perspective. Data were obtained from medical assessments and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaires (SDQs) of students with medical absence above threshold criteria (i. e. reported sick four times in 12 school weeks or more than six consecutive school days) who were referred to a youth health care physician. The results showed that the students had a mean absence rate of 14 % in 12 school weeks. Of all students, 43. 5 % had a <b>diagnosed</b> <b>disease</b> and 81. 5 % had problems such as physical complaints not yet diagnosed, psychosocial problems, lifestyle problems and sleeping difficulties. Four groups could be distinguished: 13. 4 % with a <b>diagnosed</b> <b>disease</b> and no problem, 30. 1 % with a <b>diagnosed</b> <b>disease</b> and a problem, 51. 5 % with a problem and no <b>diagnosed</b> <b>disease</b> and 5. 1 % without a <b>diagnosed</b> <b>disease</b> or problem. Significantly higher scores of the Total difficulties-scale on the SDQ were found (mean 10. 5; SD 5. 8) in the study group, compared to a reference group (mean 9. 1; SD 4. 9). In conclusion, this study shows that when using the aforementioned criteria for extensive medical absenteeism to intervene with the absence, students with a mean absence rate of 14 % in 12 school weeks are identified. If there was a <b>diagnosed</b> <b>disease,</b> it was accompanied by problems about twice as often. More than half of the students’ absence was caused by problems rather than a disease. The great diversity of these problems calls for a personalized approach. A broad perspective, including medical expertise, is needed to distinguish between emerging mental and physical diseases, psychosocial and lifestyle problems.

40|$|Abstract Background More {{people will}} {{probably}} continue working into old {{age in the}} future due to the increased size of aging populations in many countries. We therefore {{need to know more}} about older workers’ health in relation to their work situation and retirement. This study is a part of a theoretical development of older workers’ situations. Older workers’ situations are theoretically themed in nine areas by the authors of this study. The aims of the study were to investigate the relationship between: i) <b>diagnosed</b> <b>disease</b> and factors in older workers’ situations, theoretically themed in nine areas; ii) self-rated health and factors in older workers’ situations, theoretically themed in nine areas; iii) <b>diagnosed</b> <b>disease</b> and self-rated health; and iv) the relationships between these health measures and retirement. Methods A questionnaire-based cross-sectional study, using logistic regression, with 1, 756 health care personnel aged 55 – 64 years. The questionnaire used gave an overview of most different areas in the older workers’ situations. Result There was a difference in the participants’ frequency of objectively specified <b>diagnosed</b> <b>disease</b> and their subjectively experienced self-rated health. A bad self-rated health was related higher to early retirement than diagnosed diseases. In the multivariate model, having ‘Diagnosed disease’ was not significantly related to whether older workers thought they could not work beyond 65  years of age. A bad ‘Self-rated health’ was also more highly related to whether older workers thought they could not work beyond 65  years, than if the respondents stated that a ‘Diagnosed disease is a hindrance in my daily work’ in the multivariate model. Conclusion This study showed an important difference between older workers’ own experiences and the effect of their self-rated health and their diagnosed diseases. Subjective self-rated health seems to be more important to people’s retirement planning than <b>diagnosed</b> <b>disease.</b> The most important factors affecting older workers’ self-rated health was {{the degree to which they}} felt physically and mentally fatigued, their possibilities for revitalization, and issues of work satisfaction, age discrimination and attitudes of managers to them as seniors...|$|E

For routine empirical treatment of uncomplicated acute otitis media, amoxicillin is the drug of choice. Persistence of signs and symptoms of infection during antimicrobial therapy calls for a change to an antibiotic effective against 0 -lactamase-producing bacteria (e. g., trimetho-prim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin/clavulanate, or one of the newer oral cephalosporins) or performance of tympanocentesis/myringotomy or both.
