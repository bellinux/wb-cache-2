40|$|Abstract. The {{spiral bevel}} gears of <b>attack</b> <b>helicopter</b> {{transmission}} <b>systems</b> are taken as an object in this paper. The numerical analysis model for starved elastohydrodynamic lubrication (SEHL) of {{spiral bevel gears}} is established {{on the basis of}} the analysis of load tooth contacts analysis and SEHL in elliptical contacts. The SEHL characteristics of spiral bevel gears are also analyzed. The results are as follows: during the course of a gear-tooth meshing cycle of the spiral bevel gear, the extremum of minimal film thickness and maximal film pressure occurs near midpoint of the path of contact, and leans to dedendum. The minimal value of the minimal film thickness is 0. 39 um, and the maximal value of the maximal film pressure is 0. 69 GPa. The value of minimal film thickness gradually increases with the increasing of meshing point velocity. When the velocity of meshing point exceeds 110 m/s, the increase became tardiness. As the load of meshing point increases, the value of minimal film thickness gently diminishes...|$|R

The focus for the attack module is the representation of <b>attack</b> <b>helicopter</b> units {{in the conduct of}} deliberate attacks; however, many of the models described can be applied to general helicopter operations. The formulations are limited to the major events that occur during an <b>attack</b> <b>helicopter</b> deliberate <b>attack</b> and represent initial research to portray <b>attack</b> <b>helicopter</b> operations in JWAEP.

Although these two units would never see combat as HAL squadrons, they would later go on to see combat in Operation Desert Shield/Storm, Operation Uphold Democracy, Operation Joint Endeavor, Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom Freedom as HCS-4/HSC-84 and HCS-5.|$|R

50|$|Weapons used on <b>attack</b> <b>helicopters</b> {{can include}} autocannons, machine guns, rockets, and guided {{anti-tank}} missiles {{such as the}} Hellfire. Many <b>attack</b> <b>helicopters</b> are also capable of carrying air-to-air missiles, though mostly for purposes of self-defense. Today's <b>attack</b> <b>helicopter</b> has two main roles: first, to provide direct and accurate close air support for ground troops, and the second, in the anti-tank role to destroy enemy armor concentrations. <b>Attack</b> <b>helicopters</b> are also used to supplement lighter helicopters in the armed scout role.
