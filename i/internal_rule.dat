500|$|The second season's mythology was {{intended}} to be revealed in small parcels. Throughout the season, Pinkner and Wyman tried to create an episode that best bridged [...] "standalone" [...] traits—needed for casual viewers—with the further advancement of the show's mythology for those who watched regularly. At {{the start of the season}} Pinkner believed they had found a [...] "good rhythm" [...] between the two, as the mythology [...] "really [...] affect the characters, to the point where even the standalone [...] advance mythology". After the season ended, Wyman commented at San Diego Comic-Con International, [...] "We learned that the fan fans love mythology but there are needs from the networks. We started experimenting with a thing we called 'mythalones', not standalone or myth." [...] Wyman cited the season's 18th episode, [...] "White Tulip" [...] as a prime example, noting [...] "You can see that you're following Walter's journey, it's the right mix." [...] The Fringe producers strove to avoid becoming bogged down in mythology, an issue that they perceived happened in Alias, another J.J. Abrams television series. In a joint statement released midway through the season, Abrams, Pinkner, and Wyman noted that their [...] "only <b>internal</b> <b>rule</b> is that we make every effort to not raise mythological questions merely to string viewers along, but rather to provide answers that generate consequences." ...|$|E

60|$|A recent {{historical}} {{writer has}} described the world of that time as one that 'believed in established words and was invincibly blind to the obvious in things.' Certainly it seems now that nothing {{could have been more}} obvious {{to the people of the}} earlier twentieth century than the rapidity with which war was becoming impossible. And as certainly they did not see it. They did not see it until the atomic bombs burst in their fumbling hands. Yet the broad facts must have glared upon any intelligent mind. All through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries the amount of energy that men were able to command was continually increasing. Applied to warfare that meant that the power to inflict a blow, the power to destroy, was continually increasing. There was no increase whatever in the ability to escape. Every sort of passive defence, armour, fortifications, and so forth, was being outmastered by this tremendous increase on the destructive side. Destruction was becoming so facile that any little body of malcontents could use it; it was revolutionising the problems of police and <b>internal</b> <b>rule.</b> Before the last war began it was a matter of common knowledge that a man could carry about in a handbag an amount of latent energy sufficient to wreck half a city. These facts were before the minds of everybody; the children in the streets knew them. And yet the world still, as the Americans used to phrase it, 'fooled around' with the paraphernalia and pretensions of war.|$|E
