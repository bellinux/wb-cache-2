500|$|The part of Mason Verger, one of Lecter's two {{surviving}} victims, {{was originally}} offered to Christopher Reeve {{based on his}} work as a wheelchair-bound police officer in Above Suspicion (1995). Not having read the novel, Reeve showed initial interest in the role, but ultimately declined upon realizing that Verger was a quadriplegic, facially-disfigured child rapist. The part was later accepted by secondary choice Gary Oldman. Co-producer Martha De Laurentiis claimed they had a [...] "funny situation" [...] with Oldman wanting a prominent [...] "credit". She said: [...] "Now <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a prominent credit with Hannibal? The characters are Hannibal and Clarice Starling. So we really couldn't work something out (at first)." [...] Oldman was apparently [...] "out" [...] of the film for a while, but then came back in, asking to go [...] "unbilled". Oldman would become transformed and [...] "unrecognizable as himself" [...] to play the part of Verger. He would have no lips, cheeks or eyelids. Make-up artist Greg Cannom said: [...] "It's really disgusting... I've been showing people pictures , and they all just say 'Oh my God,' and walk away, which makes me very happy." [...] Oldman said that having his name completely removed from the billing and credits allowed him to [...] "do it anonymously" [...] under the heavy make-up. In home-release versions of the film, Oldman's name is included in the closing credits.|$|E

[...] "You can't impose an Imam, an Archbishop, saints, any religion...you can't politically impose these things on people," [...] said Wangdi. [...] "It has to be a decision of the followers of that tradition. The Chinese can use their political power: force. Again, it's meaningless. Like their Panchen Lama. And they can't keep their Panchen Lama in Tibet. They tried to bring him to his monastery many times but people would not see him. <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a religious leader like that?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{reshuffle}} of the ministry, Rudd demoted Garrett as Minister for Environment Protection, Heritage and the Arts. This demotion was {{in response}} to Garrett's administration of the Home Insulation Program (HIP) that was linked to four deaths, over 100 house fires and allegations of fraud. It was revealed in May 2010 that Garrett had written to Prime Minister Rudd on four occasions raising concerns about safety. Further to this, following the 2010 Labor leadership spill, Gary Gray was reported to believe that Garrett was demoted because [...] "Rudd had a shocking interview on The 7.30 Report and needed a scapegoat". Gray stated:The majority of caucus felt he had been badly treated. For Rudd and his office to position Garrett as the fall guy was disgraceful, weak, sneaky, unprincipled and just plain wrong. All along, Peter properly put his objections to the administration of the program on the record. <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a situation where Rudd executes complete and total influence, micromanages everything, yet not the home insulation program? The shape and execution of the program was certainly designed by the prime minister's office, if not the prime minister himself.|$|E

60|$|And he {{had some}} great qualities. Memory was the chief of them. He had read omnivorously, and all that he had read he {{remember}}ed, not merely in the vague, general {{way in which we}} remember what we read, but with every particular of place and date. If it were poetry, he could quote it by the page, Latin or English. Such a memory has its enormous advantage, but it carries with it its corresponding defect. With the mind so crammed with other people's goods, <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> room for any fresh manufactures of your own? A great memory is, I think, often fatal to originality, in spite of Scott and some other exceptions. The slate must be clear before you put your own writing upon it. When did Johnson ever discover an original thought, when did he ever reach forward into the future, or throw any fresh light upon those enigmas with which mankind is faced? Overloaded with the past, he had space for nothing else. Modern developments of every sort cast no first herald rays upon his mind. He journeyed in France a few years before the greatest cataclysm that the world has ever known, and his mind, arrested by much that was trivial, never once responded to the storm-signals which must surely have been visible around him. We read that an amiable Monsieur Sansterre showed him over his brewery and supplied him with statistics as to his output of beer. It was the same foul-mouthed Sansterre who struck up the drums to drown Louis' voice at the scaffold. The association shows how near the unconscious sage was to the edge of that precipice and how little his learning availed him in discerning it.|$|E
