He stated that although Friedman, Jaffa and Silver, and Salerno are each co-writing one sequel with him, they at first all worked together on all three scripts: [...] "I didn't assign each writer which film {{they were going to}} work on until the last day. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>if</b> I assigned them their scripts ahead of time, they'd tune out every time {{we were talking about the}} other movie." [...] "We... worked out every beat of the story across all three films so it all connects as one, sort of, three-film saga." [...] Cameron also stated that Weaver would be featured in all three sequels and that her character Grace Augustine would be alive. In March 2015, however, Weaver said that she will play a new character in the next film.|$|E
500|$|After Singer {{completed}} {{the three major}} productions X-Men (2000), X2 (2003) and Superman Returns (2006), he sought a smaller project before embarking upon the eventually aborted sequel to Superman Returns. Singer and McQuarrie had often made World War II films in their backyards {{while growing up in}} New Jersey, and Singer had later dealt with Nazi subject matter in Apt Pupil and X-Men. Singer first learned of the plot in the early 1980s when his mother visited Bonn and met Freya von Moltke, widow of Helmuth von Moltke, a founder of the Kreisau Circle resistance group. After learning of McQuarrie and Alexander's screenplay and signing on to direct, Singer read The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich by William L. Shirer to gain deeper understanding of Nazi Germany's political landscape, and also met with one of Hitler's bodyguards, Rochus Misch, who was the last person to leave the bunker where Hitler committed suicide. The creative team acknowledged the ambiguity over the enigmatic von Stauffenberg's true motivation, but Singer and McQuarrie judged him to be a man of ethics just from what he did. Though McQuarrie sought for Valkyrie to be similar to Conspiracy, Singer had bigger ambitions for the film, wanting it to be more than [...] "old men in rooms, talking". Singer looked back on his decision, saying, [...] "The true story had all the makings of a classic assassination thriller.... <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>if</b> I could keep the audience with [...] Stauffenberg, with his mission, they would go with the flow and be less inclined to start hypothesising on things from history." ...|$|E

2500|$|Born {{to parents}} of German descent {{and raised in}} St. Louis, Missouri, Meine served in the United States Army during World War I. [...] After a tip that Meine, who was playing semipro ball in 1920, threw [...] "a good spitball", he was signed to play {{professional}} baseball for Beaumont in the Texas League. [...] Meine made his professional baseball debut in 1921 at age 25. [...] He entered professional baseball {{the same year that}} the spitball, Meine's mainstay, was outlawed. [...] Interviewed in 1963, Meine recalled:"After the Carl MaysRay Chapman accident in 1920, baseball outlawed all freak pitches and trick deliveries. [...] I had one break. [...] Either the news was slow in reaching Texas or they didn't care {{what the rest of the}} world did. [...] The spitball was still a legal pitch in the Texas League in 1921.

2500|$|Evert versus Goolagong was {{the match}} for the 1975 US Open title, which the first set went to the superbly playing Googlagong in five games to seven. Goolagong was playing a {{slashing}} and attacking style of game during the first set and into {{the first part of}} the second set, but Evert fought back with a track down ever ball mentality, which this allowed Evert to win the second set six games to four. In the final set, Evert was down one game to two, she rallied off five more games in a row to win six games to two. To this, Evert responded [...] "I was down on myself the whole match. I felt the pressure. But after two-all in the third set, I don't know what happened but I got more confident. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>if</b> I could stay in there I could win the match." [...] This is exactly what she did, and this was her first-time that she won the US Open, which is her national open.|$|E
2500|$|With an {{interest}} in costume history, she initially worked closely with J. Michael Straczinski {{to get a sense}} of the historical perspective of the major alien races, [...] "so <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>if</b> they were a peaceful people or a warring people, cold climate etc. and then I would interpret what kind of sensibility that called for." [...] Collaborating with other departments to establish co-ordinated visual themes for each race, a broad palette of colors was developed with Iacovelli, which he referred to as [...] "spicy brights". These warm shades of grey and secondary colors, such as certain blues for the Minbari, would often be included when designing both the costumes and relevant sets. As the main characters evolved, Bruice referred back to Straczynski and producer John Copeland who she viewed as [...] "surprisingly more accessible to me as advisors than other producers and directors", so the costumes could reflect these changes. Ambassador Londo Mollari's purple coat became dark blue and more tailored while his waistcoats became less patterned and brightly colored as Bruice felt [...] "Londo has evolved in my mind from a buffoonish character to one who has become more serious and darker." ...|$|E

2500|$|The lead gunman {{then said}} [...] "Right", {{and the others}} {{immediately}} opened fire on the workers. The eleven men were shot at very close range with automatic rifles, which included Armalites, an M1 carbine and an M1 Garand. A total of 136 rounds were fired {{in less than a}} minute. The men were shot at waist-height and fell to the ground; some fell on top of each other, either dead or wounded. When the initial burst of gunfire stopped, the gunmen re-loaded their weapons. The order was given to [...] "Finish them off", and another burst of gunfire was fired into the heaped bodies of the workmen. One of the gunmen also walked amongst the dying men and shot them each {{in the head with a}} pistol as they lay on the ground.
