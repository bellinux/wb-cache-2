If this condition is not provided in necessary quality and tightness is insufficient or too big, it may cause threaded joint’s damage. The most popular methods for the threaded <b>joint’s</b> <b>assembly</b> control in machine manufacturing are as following: 1) measurement of the screw’s prolongation; 2) control of the screw-nut’s turning angle; 3) measurement of the screw-nut’s tightness moment.

This method is widely used when controlling threaded joint’s tightness for very responsible assembly units, for example, for pitman screw joints...|$|R
40|$|NoThis paper {{presents}} {{experimental results}} of temperature distribution in fire in four typical types of steel-concrete composite joint (web cleat, fin plate, flush endplate and flexible endplate) with different fire-protection schemes. The test specimens were unloaded and the steelwork of each <b>joint</b> <b>assembly</b> {{was exposed to}} a standard fire condition [ISO 834, 1975 : Fire Resistance Tests, Elements of Building Construction, International Organization for Standardization, Geneva] in a furnace. In total, 14 tests were conducted, including 4 tests without any fire protection and 10 tests with different schemes of fire protection. The main objective of these tests {{was to investigate the}} effects of three practical fire-protection schemes as alternatives to full fire protection of the entire <b>joint</b> <b>assembly.</b> The three alternative methods of fire protection were: (1) protecting a segment, instead of the entire length, of the beams; (2) unprotected bolts and (3) protecting the columns only. The main results of these tests are: (1) if all the steel work (excluding the bolts) in the <b>joint</b> <b>assembly</b> was protected, whether or not protecting the bolts had very little effect on temperatures in the protected steelwork other than the bolts. The bolt temperatures were higher if they were not protected than if they were protected, but the unprotected bolt temperatures in a joint with fire protection to other steelwork were much lower than bolt temperatures in a totally unprotected joint; (2) as far as joint temperatures are concerned, protecting a segment of 400 mm of the beam was sufficient to achieve full protection and (3) if only the column was protected, only the joint components that were in the immediate vicinity of the column (such as welds) developed noticeably lower temperatures than if the <b>joint</b> <b>assembly</b> was unprotected, but due to heat conduction from the unprotected steel beams, these temperature values were much higher than if the <b>joint</b> <b>assembly</b> was protected. Furthermore, the column temperatures in the joint region were much higher than the protected column temperatures...|$|R

50|$|During the regal period, {{the king}} {{nominated}} two quaestors {{to serve as}} his assistants, and after {{the overthrow of the}} monarchy, the Consuls retained this authority. However, in 447 BC, Cicero tells us that the Quaestors began to be elected by a tribal assembly that was presided over by a magistrate. It seems as though this was the first instance of a <b>joint</b> Patricio-Plebeian Tribal <b>Assembly,</b> and thus was probably an enormous gain for the Plebeians. While Patricians were able to vote in a <b>joint</b> <b>assembly,</b> there were never very many Patricians in Rome. Thus, most of the electors were Plebeians, and yet any magistrate elected by a <b>joint</b> <b>assembly</b> had jurisdiction over both Plebeians and Patricians. Therefore, for the first time, the Plebeians seemed to have indirectly acquired authority over Patricians. Most contemporary accounts of an assembly of the Tribes refer specifically to the Plebeian Council.|$|R
