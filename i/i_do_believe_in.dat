She said: “Many thanks to British Naturism for this great honour. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> naturism and am my happiest on a nude beach with {{people of all ages}} and races!” ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{subsequent}} {{interviews with}} Brian Williams on October 29, 2008, Palin {{was quoted as}} saying, [...] "I {{am not going to}} label myself anything, Brian, and I think that's what annoys a lot of Americans, especially in a political campaign is start trying to label different parts of America, different backgrounds.

2500|$|Rabbi Lord Immanuel Jakobovits, former Chief Rabbi of the United Synagogue of Great Britain, {{describes}} a commonly held Jewish view on this issue: [...] "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> the Chosen people concept as affirmed by Judaism in its holy writ, its prayers, and its millennial tradition. In fact, I believe that every people - and indeed, {{in a more}} limited way, every individual - is [...] "chosen" [...] or destined for some distinct purpose in advancing the designs of Providence. Only, some fulfill their mission and others do not. Maybe the Greeks were chosen for their unique contributions to art and philosophy, the Romans for their pioneering services in law and government, the British for bringing parliamentary rule into the world, and the Americans for piloting democracy in a pluralistic society. The Jews were chosen by God to be 'peculiar unto Me' as the pioneers of religion and morality; that was and is their national purpose." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sanders is a {{self-described}} democratic socialist, and progressive who admires the Nordic model of social democracy {{and is a}} proponent of workplace democracy. In November 2015, Sanders gave a speech at Georgetown University about his view of democratic socialism, including {{its place in the}} policies of presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson. In defining what democratic socialism means to him, Sanders said: [...] "I don't believe government should take over the grocery store down the street or own the means of production, but I do believe that the middle class and the working families who produce the wealth of America deserve a decent standard of living and that their incomes should go up, not down. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> private companies that thrive and invest and grow in America, companies that create jobs here, rather than companies that are shutting down in America and increasing their profits by exploiting low-wage labor abroad." [...] Based on Sanders's positions and votes throughout his political career, Noam Chomsky and Thomas Frank have described Sanders as [...] "a New Dealer".|$|E
