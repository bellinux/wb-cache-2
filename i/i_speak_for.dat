500|$|In December 2008, reports {{speculated that}} Knight {{requested}} {{to be released}} from his contract and that [...] "they were working out the details" [...] at that time. In June 2009, after the conclusion of the fifth season of Grey's Anatomy, it was confirmed that Knight would not be returning for the show's sixth season. The actor stated the reason for his departure was due to a [...] "breakdown in communication" [...] with Rhimes, O'Malley's lack of screen time, as well as his decision to be openly gay. Prior to the official announcement of his departure, there was speculation that the role of O'Malley would be recast, but Rhimes labeled it as a [...] "hilarious, ridiculous rumor". After the confirmation of his exit, Knight told TV Guide: [...] "Leaving Grey's Anatomy was not an easy decision for me to make. I am extremely grateful to {{have had the opportunity to}} play this character and will miss my fellow cast and crew very much. I continue to wish them the very best, and wholeheartedly thank all of the fans who have supported me and the show with such passion and enthusiasm." [...] In a statement confirming Knight's departure, Rhimes said: [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> the entire Grey's Anatomy family when I say we wish T.R. Knight the best in his future endeavors. He is an incredibly talented actor and a person whose strength of character is admired by all of us." ...|$|E

Gramm had said, [...] "You've heard of mental depression; this is a mental recession," [...] and [...] "We have sort of become a nation of whiners. You just hear this constant whining." [...] McCain had quickly repudiated Gramm's remarks, saying [...] "Phil Gramm doesn't speak for me, <b>I</b> <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> me. I strongly disagree."

2500|$|Columnist Barbara Ellen of The Observer {{ridiculed}} the pomposity {{of some of}} the unfavourable {{reviews in}} her column on Sunday 28 March 2010, in a jokey [...] "Open letter to London's famous Adelphi theatre": [...] "Dear Mr Adelphi, Regarding the performance I viewed last week of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom sequel, Love Never Dies, ridiculed as Paint Never Dries. With regret, I must demand my money back; it simply wasn't bad or boring enough. My companions and I paid our money and went along in good faith, expecting a right old disaster. Imagine our disappointment when it was good. The phantom bore an eerie resemblance to Martin Amis sulking after his tiff with Anna Ford, but, sir, this was not enough. A catastrophe we were promised and a catastrophe we expected to see. One concedes that it is not all the production's fault. Negative reviews, the dark art of anti-hype, are a dangerous business. However, do fine feelings pay my babysitter? I feel that I, and several innocent coach parties, were tricked into going to Paint Never Dries, and, against our will, forced to endure an enjoyable evening. I'm sure <b>I</b> <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> many when I say I left your theatre wholly dissatisfied with how incredibly satisfied I felt".|$|E
2500|$|Many viewers {{were upset}} by Lexa's {{betrayal}} of Clarke, resulting in debates about why {{she may have}} done it, and Andy Swift of TVLine's stating, [...] "I'm pretty sure <b>I</b> <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> Clarke, and all the angry viewers watching from home, when I say, 'Lexa, please meet a fiery death. ASAP.'" [...] Mariya Karimjee of Vulture viewed [...] "the hurt and confusion that washed across Eliza Taylor's face" [...] during the betrayal as [...] "one {{of the most powerful}} performances" [...] she had seen on the show and said the heavy, emotional struggle came from both characters, with Clarke realizing [...] "Lexa is the only person who understands her." [...] Kyle Fowle of The A.V. Club stated that having the characters reunite after the betrayal, [...] "allows for the show to dig into one of its most complex and compelling relationships. Clarke and Lexa are a tangle of emotions and motivations. [...] They share a connection on an emotional level, a romantic level, and they recognize the burden of responsibility that they each have taken on." [...] Fowle felt [...] "Clarke's relative forgiveness of Lexa makes sense {{within the context of the}} war of her people, and the larger political conflict at hand. When she kneels before Lexa , it's loyalty informed by weeks of patient storytelling." ...|$|E
2500|$|... – In a {{press release}} from his office, Prime Minister Gordon Brown {{condemned}} the attacks in saying: [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> the whole world – shock and outrage at the tragic destruction of innocent lives. I have already sent my sympathy and support to Prime Minister Singh of India and to say we will {{do everything we can}} to help the Indian government. Our first duty is towards British citizens caught up in this terror in Mumbai. The High Commissioner has come from Delhi to visit all those who are injured – he's visiting them now. It is too early to say any numbers for the numbers of people who are injured – we will give that during the course of the day – what I can assure you is we are doing everything within our power. We've set up a crisis centre in the foreign office where British citizens can phone in, just visit it and talk to them – they've had 800 calls already. And at the same time, we're in touch with many people who are caught up in the hotels and giving advice on what they can do. Our second responsibility is obviously to root out terrorism – to help the Indian government with their action – and that's why at the same time as giving support to the Indian prime minister, we're sending police emergency teams that are well versed in Indian terrorism and we will try to give what support we can through British police and security officials to the Indian government at this time". Foreign Secretary David Miliband also condemned the attacks, characterising them as [...] "an attack on all of us, not just India".|$|E
