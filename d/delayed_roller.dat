50|$|The report {{concluded}} that while externally the FX-05 bears obvious design elements {{there are several}} notable differences. The receiver which was styled after the G36 is in fact coupled with a simple gas piston similar in operation to the AK series which is then attached through a <b>delayed</b> <b>roller</b> system to the weapons recoil delaying system. While the more advanced parts of the rifle {{were found to be}} independently Mexican produced, Heckler & Koch officials still questioned the DGIM (the manufacturer of the FX-05) regarding the issue of the rifles receiver system which is almost identical to the G36's. It is believed that the receiver was made to be as similar to the G36 to maximize commonality between the two weapons as many of Mexico's police forces are issued with the G36. Either way it appears that the newer post lawsuit versions of the FX-05 feature a different newly designed receiver, as the newer FX-05 come with a four position fire selection (safe, single shot, three round burst, full auto) whereas the original FX-05 came with only three firing selections (safe, single shot, full auto). This theory is also reinforced by the fact the new black FX-05 models feature a visible metal protrusion before the magazine ejector and the receiver is noticeably smaller.|$|E
50|$|SIG MG 710-3 machinegun {{was based}} on the design of the MG42V/MG45 using a slight {{modification}} of the <b>roller</b> <b>delayed</b> action and chambered for 7.62 x 51 NATO. Its rate of fire is stated to be 900 rounds per minute. The first version looks very much like the MG42.|$|R
5000|$|The HK P9 is a {{semi-automatic}} pistol from Heckler & Koch in 9×19mm Parabellum and {{the first}} to use a variation of H&K's <b>roller</b> <b>delayed</b> blowback system in a pistol format and polygonal rifling now common in H&K designs. Design began around 1965 and production ran between 1969 and 1978. Only 485 single-action P9's were produced and were discontinued in 1970. A traditional double action version, the P9S (the S standing for Spannabzug, or [...] "double-action trigger") was manufactured in greater numbers.|$|R
50|$|The MG 42V {{had some}} {{influence}} in the post-war development of roller-delayed blowback system, as employed in modern Heckler & Koch small arms. The SIG MG 710-3 machinegun {{was based on the}} design of the MG45 using a slight modification of the <b>roller</b> <b>delayed</b> action. Its rate of fire is stated to be 900 rounds per minute (the same as the heavy bolt MG42) and definitely feasible, unlike the claim above, which is not credible, of a sustained 1350 rpm. This is a cyclic rate, not an effective rate of fire. The effective rate of fire is determined by cooling, not action speed.|$|R
5000|$|In February 1948, former Mauser {{engineers}} Ludwig Vorgrimler and Theodor Löffler {{were assigned}} {{the development of}} roller-delayed carbines for the French. They worked separately on carbines for the experimental 7.65×35mm cartridge, developed by Cartoucherie de Valence. Their carbines were patterned upon the prototype StG45, which had been under development at Mauser prior {{to the end of}} the war. The French ultimately abandoned their 7.65×35mm cartridge in favor of the US [...]30 carbine cartridge. Vorgrimler and Löffler then went to work on <b>roller</b> <b>delayed</b> carbines for the latter cartridge. Ultimately, Löffler's designs won out. Vorgrimler then devoted his efforts to improving Löffler's designs. Eventually, Vorgrimler tired of this and left CEAM at the end of June, 1950. Months later, Vorgrimler joined CETME in Spain.|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{dynamics}} of vibrating classifiers with rollers intended for sorting of loose materials is {{considered in the}} paper. The main goal of re-search consists in substantiation of a choice of such parameters of rollers and classifiers which provide a steady periodic mode of rollers rotation. Differential equations of rollers rotation under action of inertial forces are essentially nonlinear. These equations are transformed to equations con-cerning the value of <b>delay</b> of moving <b>rollers</b> concerning rotation of axles on which these rollers are freely suspended. As values of such delays is small, the equations of motion can be linearized with a sufficient degree of accuracy. The linearized equations represent the inhomogeneous Hill equations, which can be under certain conditions transformed into the Mathieu equations. Periodic solutions to these equations are obtained, and also stability of these solutions is investigated. Key words: classifier, roller, rotation 1...|$|R
5000|$|After the war ended, Mauser's Department 37 {{development}} {{group was}} placed under {{control of the}} French War Department's armament group, Direction des Etudes et Fabrication d'Armament (DEFA).
