Methods: A meta-analysis was performed. A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases to include randomized controlled head-to-head comparative trials evaluating {{the efficacy of}} H 2 RAs or proton pump inhibitors in healing EE. Relative risk (RR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) were calculated under a random-effects model. Results: RRs of cumulative healing rates for each comparison at 8 wk were: high dose vs standard dose H 2 RAs, 1. 17 (95 %CI, 1. 02 - 1. 33); standard <b>dose</b> proton <b>pump</b> inhibitors vs standard dose H 2 RAs, 1. 59 (95 %CI, 1. 44 - 1. 75); standard <b>dose</b> other proton <b>pump</b> inhibitors vs standard dose omeprazole, 1. 06 (95 %CI, 0. 98 - 1. 06).

40|$|Background: Washbasin {{and sink}} U-bends are {{ubiquitous}} {{in virtually all}} buildings including hospitals and smaller healthcare premises. They {{have been used for}} over a century and their principal purpose is to prevent foul odours emanating from wastewater pipes from entering buildings. U-bends are designed to retain a small volume of water, which acts as the seal preventing the passage of sewer gas from wastewater pipework. The water retained in U-bends is frequently stagnant, which encourages the growth and proliferation of microbial biofilms, populated predominantly by Gram-negative bacterial species and especially by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Over the past two decades there have been numerous reports of nosocomial outbreaks of infection related directly or indirectly to contaminated U-bends. Three different approaches at addressing this problem have been used previously including the application of chemical disinfectants such as bleach, the replacement of sanitary fixtures and/or U-bends and the use of a U-bend heating element together with vibrational cleaning. The first two approaches worked well in several studies reducing contamination and infection risks in the short term, but failed to provide a long-term solution due to recolonisation of U-bends and the associated pipework with biofilm. The use of U-bend heating elements together with vibrational cleaning was shown to be effective, but the approach is expensive as the heating elements are in constant operation. Electrochemically activated (ECA) solution generators produce two solutions through activation of dilute brine. These include a metastable oxidant solution termed ?anolyte? (predominantly hypochlorous acid (HOCl)) and a second solution termed ?catholyte? with detergent properties (predominantly sodium hydroxide (NaOH)) The solutions are generated by passing a brine solution through a flow-through electrolytic cell. Anolyte is highly microbiocidal and capable of penetrating biofilms. Previous studies from this laboratory have shown that treatment of water supplied to dental units and washbasins with residual anolyte consistently eliminates biofilm and provides output water virtually free of contamination. Aim: The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate whether periodic treatment of washbasin U-bends and associated pipework with catholyte solution as a cleaning agent followed by anolyte solution as a disinfectant could minimise biofilm contamination of U-bends. Achieving this objective would require developing an approach to seal the wastewater outflow pipework from washbasins so that U-bends and associated pipework could be completely filled with ECA solutions for specified periods of time for maximum efficacy. A second objective was to automate U-bend decontamination with ECA solutions. Methods: Initially three identical washbasin U-bends were manually filled with catholyte solution followed by anolyte solution for five min each once weekly for five weeks. Three additional identical washbasin U-bends were used as controls. A programmable system was then developed with one washbasin that automated this process using an actuator-controlled ball valve to seal the wastewater outlet pipe and chemical-resistant <b>dosing</b> <b>pumps</b> to dose ECA solutions into the U-bend and associated pipework. A Programmable Logic Controller was used to coordinate the sequence of operation of the actuator and <b>dosing</b> <b>pumps.</b> This U-bend had three cycles of five min catholyte followed by five min anolyte treatment a week for three months. Quantitative bacterial counts from treated and control U-bends were determined following each round of ECA treatment on blood agar (CBA), R 2 A, PAS and PA agars following automated treatment and on CBA and R 2 A following manual treatment. Bacterial identification was determined by comparing small ribosomal subunit rRNA gene sequences with consensus sequences for individual bacterial species in the EMBL/GenBank databases. Results: The average bacterial density from untreated U-bends throughout the study was > 1 x 105 CFU/swab on all media with Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounting for approximately 50 % of bacterial counts. Manual treatment of U-bends with ECAs reduced counts significantly (< 100 CFU/swab) (P < 0. 01 for CBA; P < 0. 005 for R 2 A). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was eliminated from the U-bend subjected to automated ECA-treatment, with average bacterial counts over 35 cycles on CBA, R 2 A, PAS and PA of 2. 1 (? 4. 5) (P< 0. 0001), 13. 1 (? 30. 1) (P< 0. 05), 0. 7 (2. 8) (P< 0. 001) and 0 (? 0) (P< 0. 05) CFU/swab, respectively. Following the three-month study period, the ECA-treated and control U-bends were removed and cut in cross-section and segments examined by electron microscopy, which revealed the virtual elimination of biofilm from the ECA-treated U-bend. In contrast, the control U-bend was heavily fouled with dense pigmented biofilm. Conclusion: Microbial contamination of washbasin U-bends can be consistently minimised by automated decontamination with ECA solutions. Future Developments: Work is in progress to develop a large-scale system for simultaneous automated decontamination of multiple washbasin U-bends...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWhen {{operating}} water recirculating systems (RAS) {{with high}} make-up water flushing rates in locations that have low alkalinity {{in the raw}} water, such as Norway, knowledge about the required RAS alkalinity concentration is important. Flushing RAS with make-up water containing low alkalinity washes out valuable base added to the RAS (as bicarbonate, hydroxide, or carbonate), which increases farm operating costs when high alkalinity concentrations are maintained; however, alkalinity must not be so low that it interferes with nitrification or pH stability. For these reasons, a {{study was designed to}} evaluate the effects of alkalinity on biofilter performance, and CO 2 stripping during cascade aeration, within two replicate semi-commercial scale Atlantic salmon smolt RAS operated with moving bed biological filters. Alkalinity treatments of nominal 10, 70, and 200 mg/L as CaCO 3 were maintained using a pH controller and chemical <b>dosing</b> <b>pumps</b> supplying sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3). Each of the three treatments was replicated three times in each RAS. Both RAS were operated at each treatment level for 2 weeks; water quality sampling was conducted {{at the end of the}} second week. A constant feeding of 23 kg/day/RAS was provided every 1 – 2 h, and continuous lighting, which minimized diurnal fluctuations in water quality. RAS hydraulic retention time and water temperature were 4. 3 days and 12. 5 ± 0. 5 °C, respectively, typical of smolt production RAS in Norway. It was found that a low nominal alkalinity (10 mg/L as CaCO 3) led to a significantly higher steady-state TAN concentration, compared to when 70 or 200 mg/L alkalinity was used. The mean areal nitrification rate was higher at the lowest alkalinity; however, the mean TAN removal efficiency across the MBBR was not significantly affected by alkalinity treatment. The CO 2 stripping efficiency showed only a tendency towards higher efficiency at the lowest alkalinity. In contrast, the relative fraction of total inorganic carbon that was removed from the RAS during CO 2 stripping was much higher at a low alkalinity (10 mg/L) compared to the higher alkalinities (70 and 200 mg/L as CaCO 3). Despite this, when calculating the total loss of inorganic carbon from RAS, it was found that the daily loss was about equal at 10, and 70 mg/L, whereas it was highest at 200 mg/L alkalinity. pH recordings demonstrated that the 10 mg/L alkalinity treatment resulted in the lowest system pH, the largest increase in [H+] across the fish culture tanks, as well as giving little response time in case of alkalinity dosing malfunction. Rapid pH changes under the relatively acidic conditions at 10 mg/L alkalinity may ultimately create fish health issues due to e. g. CO 2 or if aluminium or other metals are present. In conclusion, Atlantic salmon smolt producers using soft water make-up sources should aim for 70 mg/L alkalinity considering the relatively low loss of inorganic carbon compared to 200 mg/L alkalinity, and the increased pH stability as well as reduced TAN concentration, compared to lower alkalinity concentrations...|$|E

A family of Coil Pumps has been developed at Loughborough University over the last 10 years by the author. The coil pump, sometimes known as the 'hydrostatic pump', was known and used in the 18 th and 19 th centuries, since then {{it appears to have}} been forgotten. Laboratory investigations lead to a theory for predicting the behaviour of this little known pump The theory is based on an assessment of the boundary levels of the liquid plugs within the loops. From this work, two types of suction pump were derived and the lift pump theory was developed and adapted to predict their behaviour. One suction pump was based on one helical coil and it required a regulated air supply. The second pump used two helical coils 'back to back' one taking water into the pump and the other (of larger capacity) withdrawing it. Laboratory tests were carried out on a number of versions of both suction pumps and the experimental results agreed well with those produced by the theory. Practical applications of this family of pumps included a low cost stream powered lift <b>pump,</b> a <b>dosing</b> <b>pump,</b> a sewage suction pump and a sewage treatment process...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTThe aim of {{this study}} was to develop and {{validate}} a new in-vitro kinetic model for the combination of two drugs with different half-lives, and to use this model for the study of the pharmacodynamic effects of amphotericin B and voriconazole, alone or in combination, against a strain of Candida albicans. Bolus doses of voriconazole and amphotericin B were administered to a starting inoculum of C. albicans. Antifungal-containing medium was eliminated and replaced by fresh medium using a peristaltic pump, with the flow-rate adjusted to obtain the desired half-life of the drug with the shorter half-life. A computer-controlled <b>dosing</b> <b>pump</b> compensated for the agent with the longer half-life. Voriconazole and amphotericin B half-lives were set to 6 and 24 h, respectively. Pharmacokinetic parameters were close to target values when both single doses and sequential doses were simulated. Voriconazole and amphotericin B administered alone demonstrated fungistatic and fungicidal activity, respectively. Simultaneous administration resulted in fungicidal activity, whereas pre-exposure of C. albicans to voriconazole, followed by amphotericin at 8 and 32 h, resulted in fungistatic activity similar to that observed with voriconazole alone. Using this model, which allowed a combination of antifungal agents with different half-lives, it was possible to demonstrate an antagonistic effect of voriconazole on the fungicidal activity of amphotericin B.
