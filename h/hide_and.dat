5|$|After construction, Morris invited {{friends to}} visit, most notably Burne-Jones {{and his wife}} Georgiana, as well as Rossetti and his wife Lizzie Siddal. They aided him in {{painting}} murals on the furniture, walls, and ceilings, much of it based on Arthurian tales, the Trojan War, and Geoffrey Chaucer's stories, while he also designed floral embroideries for the rooms. They also spent much time playing tricks on each other, enjoying games like <b>hide</b> <b>and</b> seek, and singing while accompanied by the piano. Siddall stayed at the House during summer and autumn 1861 as she recovered from a traumatic miscarriage and an addiction to laudanum; she would die of an overdose in February 1862.|$|E
5|$|Companions {{would have}} {{followed}} commands {{to the best}} of their ability, but in accordance with their personality; for example, a berserker-type companion told to attack aggressively would charge into melee combat, while an assassin-type companion would attempt to <b>hide,</b> <b>and</b> then creep about knocking foes unconscious or backstabbing. In contrast, a priestess-type companion might support the player character by casting beneficial spells, while a paladin-type would give support by attacking the player character's target, and then healing the protagonist after the battle or if he or she came close to dying.|$|E
5|$|Despite its size, {{the common}} {{thresher}} is minimally dangerous to humans {{due to its}} relatively small teeth and timid disposition. It is highly valued by commercial fishers for its meat, fins, <b>hide,</b> <b>and</b> liver oil; large numbers are taken by longline and gillnet fisheries throughout its range. This shark is also esteemed by recreational anglers for the exceptional fight it offers on hook-and-line. The common thresher has a low rate of reproduction and cannot withstand heavy fishing pressure for long, {{a case in point}} being the rapid collapse of the thresher shark fishery off California in the 1980s.

5|$|More goods became {{available}} in St. Louis during the economic recovery, {{largely as a}} result of the new steamboat power. Wholesalers, new banks, and other retail stores opened starting in the late 1820s and early 1830s. The fur trade continued as a major industry into the 1830s. In 1822, Jedediah Smith joined William H. Ashley's St. Louis fur trading company. Smith would later be known for his explorations of the West and for being the first American to travel overland to California. New fur trade companies such as the Rocky Mountain Fur Company pioneered trails west.

5|$|Unlike the Robinson Crusoe of the novel, who craved human contact, {{most of the}} Warsaw Crusoes {{tried to}} avoid it at all cost. This contradiction was noted by both the Robinsons and those who wrote about them after the war. Being {{discovered}} by the Germans in almost all cases meant immediate death. There were, however, some exceptions, the best known being that of Szpilman's encounter with Wilm Hosenfeld, a captain of the Wehrmacht who helped to <b>hide</b> <b>and</b> feed him.

5|$|Although legal {{accounts}} do {{not describe}} {{the course of}} the combat, contemporary chroniclers have left several records of the day's battle. According to the chronicles, the claimants entered the field last and before all present repeated their accusations against the other and swore oaths guaranteeing their honesty before the King, Parlement and God. Before they remounted, the marshal of the duel performed a brief ceremony in which he knighted Jacques Le Gris. This ceremony was traditional before battle but also performed a part in maintaining the social structure of medieval France. With both men on the same social footing, there would be no defeat of a senior rank by a lesser one. Having been raised to the status of a knight, Sir Jacques regained his horse and the arena was cleared. Both knights were heavily armed and armoured, protected by a <b>hide</b> <b>and</b> wood shield bearing their coat of arms and thick plate armour, riding a heavy warhorse and wielding a lance, longsword, heavy battle axe and long dagger known as a misericordia.|$|E

5|$|Coyotes {{typically}} {{bite the}} throat {{just behind the}} jaw and below the ear when attacking adult sheep or goats, with death commonly resulting from suffocation. Blood loss is usually a secondary cause of death. Calves and heavily fleeced sheep are killed by attacking the flanks or hindquarters, causing shock and blood loss. When attacking smaller prey, such as young lambs, the kill is made by biting the skull and spinal regions, causing massive tissue and bone damage. Small or young prey may be completely carried off, leaving only blood as evidence of a kill. Coyotes usually leave the <b>hide</b> <b>and</b> most of the skeleton of larger animals relatively intact, unless food is scarce, in which case they may leave only the largest bones. Scattered bits of wool, skin, and other parts are characteristic where coyotes feed extensively on larger carcasses.|$|E

40|$|The present {{work was}} carried out to isolate and {{identify}} aerobic bacteria associated with raw cattle <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> sheep skins and to examine their effect on tissue of <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> skins, in Gezira region. A total of 160 samples were collected. They were collected from slaughterhouse, warehouse and tannery. Samples collected were <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> skins treated with salt, washed and air dried. Samples taken 2 hours after slaughter and samples delivered without treatment. The bacterial damage was clear in raw <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> skins delivered without treatment. They showed signs of putrefaction, offensive odour and hair slipping. A number of bacteria were isolated. A number of bacteria were isolated also from traditional salted <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> skins and this was probably due to delay in curing and absence of bacteriocides. A number of bacteria were isolated from samples taken from washed <b>and</b> air dried <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> skins and samples 2 hours taken after slaughter, this probably due to poor hygiene, large number of labors and bad condition of collection room of raw <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> skins. A total of 414 organisms were isolated and consist of 379 Grampositive bacteria and 35 were Gram- negative bacteria. One hundred and thirty four bacterial strains were isolated from fresh <b>and</b> washed cattle <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> sheep skins in slaughterhouse these include: Staphylococcus spp, Micrococcus spp, Corynebacterium spp, Aerococcus homorri, Enterococcus casselifarus, Aerococcus viridans, Enterococcus faecalis, Gamella haemolysan, Stomococcus spp, Pseudomonas spp and Eschericha coli. Also one hundred and sixty three strains were isolated from salted <b>and</b> dried cattle <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> sheep skins in warehouse these include: Staphylococcus spp, Micrococcus spp, Corynebacterium spp, Enterococcus spp, Streptococcus faecalis, Stomatococcus mucilaginosus, Bacillus spp, Morexell bovis, Proteus vulgaris bigroup II, Pseudomonas spp and Eschericha coli. One hundred and seventeen bacterial strains were isolated from raw <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> skins delivered without treatment to tannery these include: Staphylococcus spp, Micrococcus spp, Corynebacterium spp, Lactobacillus jensenii, Streptococcus spp, Enterococcus spp, Stomatococcus mucilaginous, Bacillus spp, Aerococcus viridans, Proteus vulgaris biogroupII, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas spp. Staphylococcus spp, Micrococcus spp, Corynebacterium spp, Bacillus spp, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas spp were the predominant microorganisms isolated in this study. Staphylococcus sacchrolyticus, Staphylococcus capitis, Staphylococcus hyicus, Micrococcus lylate, Corynebacterium bovis, Corynebacterium xerosis, Lactobacillus jensenii, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus intermedius, Bacillus amylogliguesta, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Staphylococcus auricularis, Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus xylosus, Micrococcus varinas, Micrococcus lentus, Corynebacterium bovis, Proteus vulgaris bigroup II and Morexella bovis were isolated from putrefied <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> skins. In this study the histological examination of putrefied area showed the most affected structures of skin layer were epidermis and dermis. The epidermis became thin with no cellular structure and appearing ribbon like and detached from dermis. The dermis became loose structures. This indicated the most affected tissue is epidermis and dermis which are valuable tissue in leather industry...|$|R

In 1995 the group dropped most of its original visual kei aesthetics in favor of a more casual look and released Dahlia (1996), which like their two previous albums debuted at number one. X Japan performed their last concert at the Tokyo Dome on December 31, 1997, making it the last of five consecutive sold-out New Year's Eve concerts the group held at the stadium.|$|E
5|$|Some animals, {{such as the}} horned lizards of North America, {{have evolved}} {{elaborate}} measures to eliminate shadow. Their bodies are flattened, with the sides thinning to an edge; the animals habitually press their bodies to the ground; and their sides are fringed with white scales which effectively <b>hide</b> <b>and</b> disrupt any remaining areas of shadow there may be under {{the edge of the}} body. The theory that the body shape of the horned lizards which live in open desert is adapted to minimise shadow is supported by the one species which lacks fringe scales, the roundtail horned lizard, which lives in rocky areas and resembles a rock. When this species is threatened, it makes itself look as much like a rock as possible by curving its back, emphasizing its three-dimensional shape. Some species of butterflies, such as the speckled wood, Pararge aegeria, minimise their shadows when perched by closing the wings over their backs, aligning their bodies with the sun, and tilting to one side towards the sun, so that the shadow becomes a thin inconspicuous line rather than a broad patch. Similarly, some ground-nesting birds including the European nightjar select a resting position facing the sun. The elimination of shadow was identified as a principle of military camouflage during the Second World War.|$|E
