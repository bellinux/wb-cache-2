5|$|As of February 2014, five former mayors are alive, {{the oldest}} being <b>Dianne</b> <b>Feinstein</b> (1978–1988; born 1933). The most recent mayor to die is George Christopher (1956–1964; born 1907), on September 14, 2000.|$|E
5|$|Eleven mayors {{are native}} San Franciscans: Levi Richard Ellert, James D. Phelan, Eugene Schmitz, James Rolph, Elmer Robinson, John F. Shelley, Joseph Alioto, George Moscone, <b>Dianne</b> <b>Feinstein,</b> Frank Jordan and Gavin Newsom. Four mayors are foreign-born: Frank McCoppin and P. H. McCarthy (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, present-day Republic of Ireland), Adolph Sutro (Prussia, present-day Germany) and George Christopher (Greece).|$|E
5|$|The {{swearing-in}} {{ceremony and}} the inaugural luncheon for President-elect Obama and Vice President-elect Biden were planned by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, a committee composed of United States Senators <b>Dianne</b> <b>Feinstein,</b> committee chair, Bob Bennett and Harry Reid, and United States Representatives John Boehner, Steny Hoyer and Nancy Pelosi. The committee is {{overseen by the}} U.S.Senate Committee on Rules and Administration.|$|E
5000|$|Ella Hill Hutch's time {{in office}} {{abruptly}} ended {{due to her}} early death of natural causes. Mayor <b>Dianne</b> M. <b>Feinstein</b> said, [...] "She was a warm woman who cared very much about {{the city and its}} people." [...] In tribute to the first African American female supervisor, a community center was built in San Francisco, California in her honor.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Dianne</b> Goldman Berman <b>Feinstein</b> ( [...] ; born Dianne Emiel Goldman; June 22, 1933) is {{the senior}} United States Senator from California. A member of the Democratic Party, she has served in the Senate since 1992. She also served as the 38th Mayor of San Francisco from 1978 to 1988.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Dianne</b> Goldman Berman <b>Feinstein</b> ( [...] ; born Dianne Emiel Goldman; June 22, 1933), {{commonly}} known as DiFi, is an American politician serving as the senior United States Senator from California. A member of the Democratic Party, she has held the position since 1992. She previously was elected as the 38th Mayor of San Francisco from 1978 to 1988.|$|R
5|$|In the {{following}} days, gay leaders refused {{to apologize for}} {{the events of that}} night. This led to increased political power in the gay community, which culminated in the election of Mayor <b>Dianne</b> <b>Feinstein</b> to a full term {{the following}} November. In response to a campaign promise, Feinstein appointed a pro-gay Chief of Police, which increased recruitment of gay people in the police force and eased tensions.|$|E
5|$|As the 1984 U.S. presidential {{election}} primary season neared its end and Walter Mondale became the likely Democratic nominee, {{the idea of}} picking a woman as his vice-presidential running mate gained considerable momentum. The National Organization for Women and the National Women's Political Caucus pushed the notion, as did several top Democratic figures such as Speaker Tip O'Neill. Women mentioned for the role included Ferraro and Mayor of San Francisco <b>Dianne</b> <b>Feinstein,</b> {{both of whom were}} on Mondale's five-person short list.|$|E
5|$|On April 30, {{legislators in}} the U.S. Congress {{released}} the proposed 2017 federal budget, which included partial {{funding for the}} electrification project, but restricts its distribution unless Secretary Chao signs off on the grant. The proposed budget includes $100million of the $647million grant, with the balance expected in future years. Secretary Chao claimed she could not sign the grant without the full grant being budgeted, which was disputed by Caltrain and both California Senators <b>Dianne</b> <b>Feinstein</b> and Kamala Harris. On May 22, the FTA announced its intent to sign the funding grant, restoring the final piece of funding for the electrification project. The official grant was finally signed on May 23.|$|E
2500|$|In San Francisco, California protests {{occurred}} {{throughout the}} day and {{in different parts of}} the city with up to 150 people arrested for misdemeanors such as trespassing, resisting arrest and blocking an intersection. Part of the success of the group coordinating named Direct Action was due to utilizing smart mob technologies including text messaging, Google Maps, live video-feeds and internet radio updates. In contrast to the first-day protests in 2003 when the city was effectively shut down in many ways, the protests were focussed on specific targets and conveying messages – [...] "there's little point in barricading the Bay Bridge in a city where most people are against the war anyway." [...] In the morning, a group of 500 worked their way through the morning commute effectively tying-up traffic for hours as the police had to block, move and re-block streets and busses for the procession. The Federal Reserve Bank and Chevron Corporation were also targeted with actions and saw arrests. Starting around noon and lasting for several hours the most [...] "dramatic" [...] protests were a die-in – again blocking the main traffic artery, Market Street – directly in front of California Senator <b>Dianne</b> Feinstein's office. <b>Feinstein</b> supported the Iraq war resolution and subsequent supplemental appropriations bills although she has stated she was deceived by the Bush administration about the weapons of mass destruction. As police arrested dozens of protesters more would take their place. In the evening 7000 marched and rallied in front of San Francisco City Hall hearing speeches including Assemblywoman Carole Migden. Although mostly peaceful some police were pelted with glass Christmas ornaments filled with paint.|$|R
5|$|Two decades later, Phoenix was {{the subject}} of discussions about the city budget. In the late 1970s, the fireboat's annual {{operating}} expenses were about $1.2million. Mayor George Moscone met with the San Francisco Port Commission in 1977 to determine whether Phoenix would be refurbished, replaced, or scrapped with no replacement. An improvement bond was passed in November 1977 to build a new fireboat. Local naval architects Morris Guralnick Associates submitted a design in 1980 to replace Phoenix, but the estimated construction costs far exceeded the bond. Instead, Mayor <b>Dianne</b> <b>Feinstein</b> redirected the funds to refurbish Phoenix in 1981–1982.|$|E
5|$|Congressman Phillip Burton, Assemblyman Willie Brown, {{and other}} California {{politicians}} recognized the growing clout {{and organization of}} homosexuals in the city, and courted their votes by attending meetings {{of gay and lesbian}} organizations. Brown pushed for legalization of sex between consenting adults in 1969 but failed. SIR was also pursued by popular moderate Supervisor <b>Dianne</b> <b>Feinstein</b> in her bid to become mayor, opposing Alioto. Ex-policeman Richard Hongisto worked for 10 years to change the conservative views of the San Francisco Police Department, and also actively appealed to the gay community, which responded by raising significant funds for his campaign for sheriff. Though Feinstein was unsuccessful, Hongisto's win in 1971 showed the political clout of the gay community.|$|E
5|$|Federal {{and state}} {{officials}} became concerned about ticket scalping and fraud related to sales of the tickets for the swearing-in ceremony. Senator <b>Dianne</b> <b>Feinstein,</b> chair of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, introduced legislation in mid-November 2008 to ban sales of tickets to the swearing-in ceremony. At the same time, the joint congressional committee contacted online auction operators, ticket resellers and classified listing services to block sales of the tickets. To address the committee's concerns, StubHub and eBay agreed to ban ticket sales for the swearing-in ceremony on all of its sites. Senator Feinstein re-introduced legislation in December 2008 to ban ticket sales for the swearing-in ceremony after amending the bill to exempt tickets issued by official presidential inaugural committees for inaugural event fundraising. The U.S.Senate failed to pass the final bill, which caused the bill {{to die in the}} closing days of the lame duck legislative session.|$|E
5|$|If {{the mayor}} dies in office, resigns, or {{is unable to}} carry out his/her duties and he/she did not {{designate}} an acting mayor, {{the president of the}} Board of Supervisors becomes acting mayor until the full Board select a person to fill the vacancy and finish the previous mayoral term. (In the case that both the president of the Board of Supervisors and the mayor are incapacitated, the order of succession is followed.) This has happened six times: James Otis died in office and was succeeded by George Hewston, Eugene Schmitz was removed and succeeded by Charles Boxton, Charles Boxton resigned and was succeeded by Edward Robeson Taylor, James Rolph resigned and was succeeded by Angelo Rossi, George Moscone was assassinated and was succeeded by <b>Dianne</b> <b>Feinstein,</b> and Gavin Newsom resigned and was succeeded by Ed Lee.|$|E
5|$|To date, 42 {{individuals}} {{have served as}} mayor. There have been 43 mayoralties due to Charles James Brenham's serving two non-consecutive terms: he is counted chronologically as both the second and fourth mayor. The longest term was that of James Rolph, who served over 18 years until his resignation to become the California governor. The length of his tenure as mayor was largely due to his popularity. During his term, San Francisco saw the expansion of its transit system, {{the construction of the}} Civic Center and the hosting of the World's Fair. The shortest term was that of Charles Boxton, who served only eight days before resigning from office. Two mayors have died in office: Otis died from illness and Moscone was assassinated. <b>Dianne</b> <b>Feinstein</b> is the only woman, Willie Brown is the only African American, and Ed Lee is the only Asian American to have served as mayor.|$|E
5|$|When Milk's friends {{looked in}} his closet for a suit for his casket, they learned how much he had been {{affected}} by the recent decrease in his income as a supervisor. All of his clothes were coming apart; all of his socks had holes. He was cremated and his ashes were split, most of them scattered in San Francisco Bay by his closest friends. Some of them were encapsulated and buried beneath {{the sidewalk in front of}} 575 Castro Street, where Castro Camera had been located. There is a memorial to Milk also at Neptune Society Columbarium, ground floor, San Francisco, California. Harry Britt, one of four people Milk listed on his tape as an acceptable replacement should he be assassinated, was chosen to fill that position by the city's acting mayor, <b>Dianne</b> <b>Feinstein.</b>|$|E
25|$|After Moscone's death, <b>Dianne</b> <b>Feinstein</b> became {{mayor of}} San Francisco.|$|E

25|$|In June 2008 Boxer {{spoke in}} the Senate in {{opposition}} to the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, a pending bill in the United States Congress to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and later broke with her counterpart Sen. <b>Dianne</b> <b>Feinstein</b> and voted against it.|$|E
25|$|Hutchison was {{the most}} senior female Republican senator {{by the end of}} her tenure, and the fifth most senior female senator, having assumed office in June 1993 behind Senators Barbara Mikulski (D-MD, 1987), <b>Dianne</b> <b>Feinstein</b> (D-CA, 1992), Barbara Boxer (D-CA, January 1993), and Patty Murray (D-WA, January 1993).|$|E
25|$|In the 114th Congress, {{there are}} 10 Jews among 100 U.S. Senators: nine Democrats (Michael Bennet, Richard Blumenthal, Barbara Boxer, Benjamin Cardin, <b>Dianne</b> <b>Feinstein,</b> Al Franken, Carl Levin, Charles Schumer, Ron Wyden), and Bernie Sanders, {{who became a}} Democrat to run for President but {{returned}} to the Senate as an Independent.|$|E

25|$|Pete Wilson {{was elected}} Governor of California to succeed {{outgoing}} two-term Republican governor George Deukmejian, who {{chose not to}} seek a third term in 1990, defeating former San Francisco Mayor <b>Dianne</b> <b>Feinstein,</b> who {{would go on to}} be elected to Wilson's former U.S. Senate seat two years later. Wilson was sworn in as governor on January 7, 1991.|$|E
25|$|Despite their {{personal}} differences, White and Supervisor Harvey Milk initially had several areas of political agreement and they worked well together at first. Harvey Milk {{was one of}} three people from the city hall invited to the baptism of White's newborn child shortly after the election. White also persuaded <b>Dianne</b> <b>Feinstein,</b> then president of the board of supervisors, to appoint Milk chairman of the Streets and Transportation Committee.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed Britt's {{measure to}} extend health {{insurance}} coverage to domestic partners of public employees, {{largely because of the}} reaction to the early days of AIDS, but did not provide for a registry available to the general public. Mayor <b>Dianne</b> <b>Feinstein</b> vetoed the measure. Eventually San Francisco and other communities, such as Berkeley, and some local agencies enacted a similar measure.|$|E
25|$|Following Holder's {{announcement}} that the Obama Administration {{would no longer}} defend DOMA Section 3 in court, on March 16, 2011, Senator <b>Dianne</b> <b>Feinstein</b> introduced the Respect for Marriage Act in the Senate again and Nadler introduced it in the House. The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 10–8 in favor of advancing the bill to the Senate floor, but observers believed it would not gain the 60 votes needed to end debate {{and bring it to}} a vote.|$|E
25|$|Warner {{was quite}} moderate, {{especially}} {{in comparison to}} most Republican Senators from the South. He was among the minority of Republicans to support gun control laws. He voted for the Brady Bill and, in 1999, {{was one of only}} five Republicans to vote to close the so-called gun show loophole. In 2004 Warner was one of three Republicans to sponsor an amendment by Senator <b>Dianne</b> <b>Feinstein</b> (D-CA) that sought to provide for a 10-year extension of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban.|$|E
25|$|Talent cosponsored the Combat Meth Act with Sen. <b>Dianne</b> <b>Feinstein</b> (D-CA). The legislation, {{which was}} {{attached}} to the reauthorization of the USA Patriot Act, passed on March 2, 2006 and restricts the sale of products necessary to produce methamphetamines. President Bush signed the act into law on March 9, 2006. As a result of the act, certain cold medicines are only to be made available behind the counter and the amount of such medicines that can be purchased by one person is limited.|$|E
25|$|Jews as an {{important}} Democratic constituency are especially politically active and influential in large cities such as New York City, Los Angeles, Boston, Chicago; and play critical roles in large cities within presidential swing states, such as Philadelphia, Miami, and Las Vegas. Many prominent national Democrats in recent decades have been Jewish, including Chuck Schumer, Carl Levin, Abraham Ribicoff, Ben Cardin, Henry Waxman, Martin Frost, Joseph Lieberman, Bernie Sanders, <b>Dianne</b> <b>Feinstein,</b> Barney Frank, Barbara Boxer, Paul Wellstone, Rahm Emanuel, Russ Feingold, Herb Kohl, and Howard Metzenbaum.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dianne</b> <b>Feinstein</b> is {{the current}} senior senator in the U.S. Senate {{representing}} California. Prior to her time in the Senate, she ran for Governor of California, and was Mayor of San Francisco. Feinstein tends {{to be seen as}} a moderate in the Senate. She has worked to ban civilian firearm ownership and to gain passage of the California Desert Protection Act to preserve wilderness. She voted to authorize the use of military force in Iraq in 2002, and has stated that she is a supporter of the Patriot Act.|$|E
