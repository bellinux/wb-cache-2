40|$|Samenvatting: The {{linguistic}} {{diversity in the}} European Union is generally viewed as {{an essential component of}} the European identity, but the <b>linguistic</b> <b>regime</b> of the EU institutions (with eleven official and working languages) is not undisputed. In addition, the upcoming enlargements will complicate greatly the continuation of the present practices as new Member States bring new official languages. As a result, the debate about possible reforms is likely to be boosted by the necessity to prepare EU institutions for further enlargment. The present regime of institutional multilingualism is criticised from different angles, resulting in three options for the future. In this paper the <b>linguistic</b> <b>regime</b> of EU institutions is discussed in relation to general ideas about the nature of this supranational political system. Supranationalism is treated here as a program to supersede nationalism. Three variants are distinguished: pacified nationalism, neo-nationalism and post-nationalism. The paper examines how these different visions of Europe shed different lights on the issue of multilingualism (in terms of communication, identity and power) and its institutionalisation in the <b>linguistic</b> <b>regime</b> of the core instituions of the European Union. Although the three models are compatible with several arrangements, they support or oppose them for different reasons. Besides, they differ regarding the significance of the <b>linguistic</b> <b>regime</b> of the EU institutions for the whole polity and their ability to steer linguistic practice...|$|R

First, it refers to the obligation to have a knowledgeof Catalan and the nature of such an obligation; second, to the consolidationof the legal position regarding the Aranés language; and—followingthis—the article analyses the types of participation undertaken by the Spanishcentral government and the Generalitat (the Catalan Government) inthe foreign projection of the Catalan language at European and internationallevels, and in the relationship held with territories having linguisticassociations with Catalonia. Fourth and finally, it assesses recognition of acatalogue of linguistic rights in different public and private sectors (PublicAdministration and particularly the area of justice, and business) companies).

40|$|There are {{media and}} {{research}} reports of international {{students from the}} People’s Republic of China as being deficient in the capabilities for thinking critically. This paper argues for {{a shift in the}} frame for researching their critical thinking, moving the focus from the ethno-national label of “Chinese students” to “multilingual students” and their <b>full</b> <b>linguistic</b> repertoire. This opens up possibilities for exploring definitions of modes of critical thinking in Zhongwen (the official language of China) and English, and the importance of critical thinking in higher education in Australia, China and elsewhere. Attention then turns to constructions of “Chinese students” as uncritical, with explanations for their learning deficit including poor English language proficiency, lack of relevant knowledge, inappropriate assessment and deficiencies in China’s educational system. This paper concludes by suggesting research into post-monolingual education may find a theoretic-pedagogical framework that sees multilingual students use their <b>full</b> <b>linguistic</b> repertoire to develop modes of critical thinking while dealing with the tensions posed by English-only monolingual education...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{ground-breaking}} research {{in the study of}} languages in doctoral education. It argues for democratizing the production and dissemination of original contributions to knowledge through activating and mobilizing multilingual Higher Degree Researchers’ (HDRs) capabilities for theorizing through them using their <b>full</b> <b>linguistic</b> repertoire. This paper contributes to this study’s development of post-monolingual research methodology which provides a theoretic-pedagogical framework for multilingual HDRs (a) to use their <b>full</b> <b>linguistic</b> repertoire in their research; (b) to develop their capabilities for theorizing and (c) to construct potentially valuable theoretical tools using metaphors, images, concepts and modes of critique. This paper is based on a longitudinal program of collaborative research whereby monolingual Anglophone and multilingual HDRs jointly developed their capabilities for theorizing through producing Anglo-Chinese analytical tools, and the associated pedagogies for using their languages in doctoral research. This longitudinal research program has been undertaken in the field of doctoral education to further a defining feature of democracy, namely linguistic diversity. This research has been conducted with the aims of promoting the multilingualism of Australian universities and activating linguistic communities of scholars to use their <b>full</b> <b>linguistic</b> repertoire in their research. The main finding arising from this program of research has been the development of post-monolingual research methodology which (a) uses the divergences within and between languages to undertake theorizing and (b) in co-existence with the tensions posed by monolingualism, especially the insistence on using extant theories available in only one language. Doctoral pedagogies of intellectual/racial equality provide multilingual HDRs with insights into the debates about the geopolitics governing the use of languages in the production and dissemination of theoretical knowledge and the capabilities for theorizing. Often, from an English-only monolingual mindset, difference and divergence are seen as a recipe for deficits and dissonance. However, this paper challenges such mistaken beliefs by showing that multilingual HDRs can deepen and extend their capabilities for theorizing by using their own linguistic repertoires. Post-monolingual research methodology is to be of enormous benefit to multilingual researchers and scholars engaged in intellectual labor in predominantly English-only monolingual universities...|$|R

40|$|Drawing on {{the concept}} of {{representative}} bureaucracy, this article examines how two multilingual states - Canada and Switzerland - deal with issues related to the participation of different linguistic communities in the federal public service. Following a political mobilization of the linguistic cleavage, strategies to promote multilingualism in the public service have been adopted in both countries. The Canadian strategy focuses on equal treatment of Anglophones and Francophones in the public service. In Switzerland, adequate representation of the linguistic communities is the primary goal. These differences are explained by the characteristics of the <b>linguistic</b> <b>regimes</b> in each of the two countries {{as well as by the}} peculiarities of consociational democracy in Switzerland.
