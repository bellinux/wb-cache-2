The monument was destroyed in 1868, rebuilt in 1912, and renovated in 2003. It is a venue for events organized by the Polish minority in Moldova.|$|E
500|$|Newton and Cowper {{attempted}} {{to present a}} poem or hymn for each prayer meeting. The lyrics to [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] were written in late 1772 and probably used in a prayer meeting {{for the first time}} on January 1, 1773. A collection of the poems Newton and Cowper had written for use in services at Olney was bound and published anonymously in 1779 under the title Olney Hymns. Newton contributed 280 of the 348 texts in Olney Hymns; [...] "1 Chronicles 17:16–17, Faith's Review and Expectation" [...] was the title of the poem with the first line [...] "Amazing grace!

He {{grew up in a}} patriotic family, and his mother often took him and his brother to the grave of her grandfather Stanisław Żółkiewski, Grand Hetman of the Crown, who was killed in the battle of Cecora in 1620. Zofia Teofila Daniłłowicz taught her sons the inscription upon their great-grandfather's grave: [...] "O quam dulce et decorum est pro patria mori!" [...] (<b>How</b> <b>sweet</b> and glorious it is to die for one's homeland!). On 29 October 1639 Sobieski became Starosta of Jaworów.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{praised the}} game for its large levels, {{colorful}} graphics and backgrounds, increased cast of characters, enemies, and music. GameSpot stated that [...] "time may have eroded Sega's prominence, but it hasn't done much to diminish <b>how</b> <b>sweet</b> Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is," [...] and, along with other reviewers, commented on how {{it is still a}} fun game to play. Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded it as the best Sega Genesis game of 1992. In 2000, Game Informer ranked Sonic 2 number 61 on its [...] "Top 100 Games of All Time" [...] list, calling it [...] "the most challenging and finely polished Sonic the Hedgehog title." [...] Mega placed the game at #36 in their [...] "Top Sega Mega Drive Games of All Time" [...] list. Critics also enjoyed the faster gameplay the game offered in comparison to its predecessor, as well as its new features. Lucas Thomas of IGN praised the new [...] "Spin-Dash" [...] ability, which would prepare Sonic to launch at a faster speed. Thomas also noted that the levels of Sonic 2 were designed to showcase the character's speed, and was less a [...] "platform-jumping game" [...] than a [...] "platform-running" [...] game, in slight contrast to its predecessor.|$|E
500|$|Northumberland {{was tried}} on 18 August 1553 in Westminster Hall. The panels {{of the jury}} and judges were largely made up of his former colleagues. Dudley hinted that he had acted on the {{authority}} of Prince and Council and by warrant of the Great Seal. Answered that the Great Seal of a usurper was worth nothing, he asked [...] "whether any such persons as were equally culpable of that crime ... might be his judges". After sentence was passed, he begged the Queen's mercy for his five sons, the eldest of whom was condemned with him, the rest waiting for their trials. He also asked to [...] "confess to a learned divine" [...] and was visited by Bishop Stephen Gardiner, who had passed most of Edward's reign in the Tower and was now Mary's Lord Chancellor. The Duke's execution was planned for 21 August at eight in the morning; however, it was suddenly cancelled. Northumberland was instead escorted to St Peter ad Vincula, where he took the Catholic communion and professed that [...] "the plagues that is upon the realm and upon us now {{is that we have}} erred from the faith these sixteen years." [...] A great propaganda coup for the new government, Dudley's words were officially distributed—especially in the territories of the Emperor Charles V. In the evening the Duke learnt [...] "that I must prepare myself against tomorrow to receive my deadly stroke", as he wrote in a desperate plea to the Earl of Arundel: [...] "O my good lord remember <b>how</b> <b>sweet</b> life is, and how bitter ye contrary." [...] On the scaffold, before 10,000 people, Dudley confessed his guilt but maintained: ...|$|E

It was not a serious contender on the charts. Their albums' failure to match {{the success of their}} singles was a problem that would plague the band throughout their career.|$|E

Tuberculosis was the key element of Thérèse's final suffering, but she saw {{that as part of}} her spiritual journey. After observing a {{rigorous}} Lenten fast in 1896, she went to bed on the eve of Good Friday and felt a joyous sensation. She wrote: [...] "Oh! <b>how</b> <b>sweet</b> this memory really is! ... I had scarcely laid my head upon the pillow when I felt something like a bubbling stream mounting to my lips. I didn't know what it was." [...] The next morning her handkerchief was soaked in blood and she understood her fate. Coughing up of blood meant tuberculosis, and tuberculosis meant death. She wrote, [...] "I thought immediately of the joyful thing that I had to learn, so I went over to the window. I was able to see that I was not mistaken. Ah! my soul was filled with a great consolation; I was interiorly persuaded that Jesus, on the anniversary of His own death, wanted to have me hear His first call!" ...|$|E

Miriam then forces a now hugely stressed Annabel to tell her own [...] "ghost story" [...] of her marriage, insisting she needs to know now. So Annabel talks of how they met at a sales conference; how they saw films together, her liking romantic comedies, him liking violent blockbusters; how they started sleeping together and got married to formalise the arrangement; how one day he snapped over something trivial and hit her; <b>how</b> <b>sweet</b> {{he was when he}} apologised afterwards; how distant he grew the rest of the time; how she ended up provoking him to get his attention this way. Miriam asks if she enjoyed being hit, adding that she doesn't know any more if she enjoyed what happened to her. She muses the people you hurt most are the people you love, and before returning indoors, says to Annabel: [...] "I love you".|$|E
2500|$|After {{the death}} of her brother in 1870, the people of Acre started to respect the Bahá'ís and in particular, `Abdu'l-Bahá, `Abdu'l-Bahá was able to arrange for houses to be rented for the family, the family later moved to the Mansion of Bahjí around 1879 when an {{epidemic}} caused the inhabitants to flee. Bahíyyih was 23 when she left the harsh prison. Despite the unhappy start, Acre was the place of some of the happiest times of Bahíyyih Khánum's life. With `Abdu'l-Bahá's marriage to Munírih Khánum, she had a companion of the same age and the two became close friends of each other. The Bahá’ís realised that it was unlikely Bahíyyih Khánum would ever marry and she was respected for her choice of singlehood over matrimony at a time when marriage was seen as obligatory for a young woman. Bahíyyih Khánum helped her mother and father with serving pilgrims who came and visited the family. She was always concerned over her delicate mother's heath and served her diligently. [...] Bahá’u’lláh saw his daughter as consolation and solace describing [...] "how sweet thy presence before Me; <b>how</b> <b>sweet</b> to gaze upon thy face, to bestow upon thee My loving-kindness, to favour thee with My tender care".|$|E

2500|$|Garbage was {{acclaimed}} {{by contemporary}} critics. In Entertainment Weekly, Steven Mirkin said the band's songwriting {{was just as}} exceptional as Vig's guitar and drum sounds, highlighting the [...] "menacing sexuality, sonic playfulness, inventive guitar treatments, and cool vocals by Shirley Manson". Gil Kaufman from Addicted to Noise found the record's sound [...] "akin to a Jackson Pollock painting, thick layers upon layers of sound that have been stripped down, torn apart, pasted together and then stripped again, until {{the result is a}} dizzying soundscape that reveals fresh nuances upon repeated listening". He added that the music's mix of ambience, rhythms, and noise [...] "gels and rises above the din thanks to catchy hooks and killer song construction." [...] Melody Maker hailed it as the closest to [...] "perfection as a pop/rock record" [...] as can be, while NME called it [...] "a reminder of <b>how</b> <b>sweet</b> angst can {{be in the hands of}} talented players". Garbage was voted the 19th best album of 1995 in the Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics published by The Village Voice. The newspaper's Robert Christgau was somewhat less impressed by the album. He named [...] "Queer" [...] and [...] "Supervixen" [...] as its highlights while jokingly writing [...] "if Whale is Tricky without a dark side, Garbage is Whale without Tricky and depressed about it". Keith Harris wrote in The Rolling Stone Album Guide that the record's electronic guitar hooks and Manson's [...] "pop-star-as-one-night-stand" [...] persona were seductive but had a [...] "tawdry disposability".|$|E
