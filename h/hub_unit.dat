The ME-Wheel radial stiffness {{is found to be}} inversely proportional to the suspension <b>hub</b> and hinge <b>unit</b> length and the reduction rate of the radial stiffness is greater than the increase in the suspension <b>hub</b> and hinge <b>unit</b> length. In the future, the machining and installation errors can be properly controlled by the regularity of this study, thus the required radial stiffness of the ME-Wheel is obtained.|$|R
5000|$|The game {{follows the}} 2001-2003 storyline {{with only one}} obvious omission; {{the first part of}} the 2001 story, when the Toa first face Makuta, was cut out. However, many parts of the story were [...] "reduced." [...] The game begins when the Bohrok are attacking Mata Nui, and spends two levels {{depicting}} Tahu and Kopaka's battles with them. After that, the game moves on to Gali Nuva's level, in which the Bohrok Kal are introduced, and all defeated at once by Gali. In the storyline, Tahu Nuva uses the Kanohi Vahi, mask of time, to allow himself and the other five Toa to defeat them. Pohatu's level then depicts a [...] "midpoint" [...] between storylines; Pohatu is delivering the news that the Rahkshi have awakened to Onua. Onua then defeats Lerahk in his level by dropping a <b>hub</b> <b>unit</b> on Lerahk, Lewa fights Panrahk in his level, and Tahu lava-surfs after Kurahk, who has made off with the Mask of Light. When he catches Kurahk, the Mask of Light fuses itself to Takua, who becomes Takanuva (Takua Nuva in the game) and defeats Makuta, Lord of Shadows, in the game's final level. He transforms on Takutanuva and opens the door and awakes Mata Nui. The Turaga and Matoran only make a couple appearances, none of which are very significant to the plot.|$|E

40|$|Load Sensing Bearing (LSB) {{units are}} based on the {{measurement}} of the elastic deformation of the outer ring of the bearing unit usually using strain gauges which are placed along the circumference of the bearing. The master thesis is aimed at estimating the lateral tire force of a vehicle wheel using the vehicle wheel bearing <b>hub</b> <b>unit</b> which is instrumented to become a LSB and is placed in a BMW E 60 lab vehicle. Calibration of the LSB is needed to obtain a strain-force model. In situ calibration is expensive, time consuming and not always possible. Therefore a calibration system, the Bearing Test System (BETSY) has been used. Sensor responses of the LSB are greatly influenced by differences in bearing housing compliance where on one hand the LSB is mounted on the machine {{and on the other hand}} in the vehicle. It will be shown how it is possible to use BETSY as calibration system when the LSB is mounted to machine via the actual knuckle and ball joints found in the vehicle. Next, a Multivariate Linear Regression Analysis (MLRA) is used to obtain a strain-force model to estimate the lateral force. However, the strain gauges are subjected to thermal influences of a low frequent nature and can therefore only be used to estimate the ‘high’- frequent lateral force. Besides that, it is not possible with the specific compact wheel <b>hub</b> <b>unit</b> of the BMW E 60 lab vehicle to determine, with the strain gauges, whether the vehicle is turning left or right. To overcome these two issues, two Eddy-current sensors measuring the tilting movement of the ABS-ring, which is integrated in the seal of the bearing, are used to determine the direction and to estimate the low frequent content of the lateral force. Calibration and validation experiments are performed to show the accuracy and precision of the lateral force estimation.

40|$|Abstract—Robust {{estimation}} of vehicle states (e. g., vehicle sideslip angle and roll angle) {{is essential for}} vehicle stability control applications such as yaw stability control and roll sta-bility control. This paper proposes novel methods for estimating sideslip angle and roll angle using real-time lateral tire force measurements, obtained from the multi-sensing <b>hub</b> (MSHub) <b>units,</b> for practical applications to vehicle control systems of in-wheel-motor-driven electric vehicles. In vehicle sideslip estima-tion, a recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm with a forgetting factor is utilized based on a linear vehicle model and sensor measurements. In roll angle estimation, the Kalman filter is designed by integrating available sensor measurements and roll dynamics. The proposed estimation methods, RLS-based sideslip angle estimator and the Kalman filter are evaluated through field tests on an experimental electric vehicle. The experimental {{results show that the}} proposed estimator can accurately estimate the vehicle sideslip angle and roll angle. It is experimentally confirmed that the estimation accuracy is improved by more than 50 % comparing to conventional method’s one (see RMS error shown in Fig. 4). Moreover, the feasibility of practical applications of the lateral tire force sensors to vehicle state estimation is verified through various test results.

They could either be controlled with a special 5-speed shifter which operated both cables, or with a regular 3-speed shifter and a friction shifter.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper studies {{a closed}} {{queueing}} network containing a hub (a state dependent queueing system with service {{depending on the}} number of units residing here) and k satellite stations, which are GI/M/ 1 queueing systems.

50|$|Suntour's slant-parallelogram, {{spring-loaded}} top pivot {{rear derailleur}} provided the best shifting on the market. When Suntour's rear derailleur patent expired, the design was promptly copied by Shimano.In 1969, SunTour {{was the first}} Japanese gear and shifter manufacturer to introduce indexed shifting on bicycles (indexed shifting appeared at least {{as early as the}} Funiculo derailleur fitted to 1935 Shultz bicycles). Although their system, called Five-Speed Click, worked well, it proved an idea ahead of its time and did not catch on with the riding public. Another design innovation was the first practical Japanese freehub — the Unit-Hub - which combined freewheel and hub in one component (<b>unit</b> <b>hubs</b> were available at least as early as the 1938 Bayliss-Wiley, probably earlier). The freehub greatly increased the strength of the rear wheel, but the idea was not pursued.|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{growth in}} {{automotive}} sector and stringent safety requirements {{have led to}} the need for more sophisticated feedback mechanisms for the vehicle systems. One of the major breakthrough is anticipated with the use of estimated loads with help of a Load Sensing Bearing. Load Sensing Bearing is a concept in which strain is measured on a <b>hub</b> bearing <b>unit</b> with help of strain gauges and this measured strain is used to estimate the load generated between the road surface and the tire. Different kind of algorithms to estimate the load from the measured strain on a bearing are found in literature. These algorithms are based on the signal analysis and filtering of the measured strain signals. Moreover, the position of strain gauges to measure the strain on bearing are decided based on the intuition. It is expected that if the model of the internal load distribution of a bearing is included in the estimation process, in conjunction with the measured strain, the developed algorithm can give more accurate estimation of a load. A methodological approach of estimating an applied moving load from the measured strain and using the information of a load distribution is developed using a representative beam model. Also, the effect of different parameters affecting the estimation of load is quantified using the strain-load relation. To get an estimation of an applied moving load on an average sense, least square analyses were introduced. It was found that if the information of the uncertainties in parameters is included to estimate the load with help of the Weighted Least Square, the results were significantly improved. Further, in absence of the information about the uncertainty in parameters, usefulness of the iterative reweighting least square – a heuristic least square method – is also checked. Least square methods also gave insight to the suitability of different strain measurement positions by the measure of a goodness of fit. It is concluded that if the information of load distribution and uncertainty in parameter is used, in addition to the measured strain, to estimate the applied moving load; the resulting estimation is accurate up to 2. 5 % with 95 % confidence bounds for a certain strain measurement positions using Weighted Least Square method. This methodology will be useful for further exploration in the field of a Load Sensing Bearing to improve the load estimation and as well as to formulate the optimization strategy for the placement of strain gauges on the bearing.
