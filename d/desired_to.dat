5|$|In 1921, a labour strike {{erupted in}} the Buckingham and Carnatic Mills in Madras. This strike was led by V. Kalyanasundara Mudaliar, {{a leader of the}} Indian National Congress. The strike lasted for over six months during which around 10,000 workers struck work. A {{crackdown}} was ordered. Eventually, two factions emerged; one group of workers <b>desired</b> <b>to</b> return to work while another wished to continue the strike. Violent riots broke out when striking workers prevented the others from returning to work. The riots began to assume communal colours as the workers who wished to continue the strike were mostly caste Hindus while those who <b>desired</b> <b>to</b> end it were largely untouchables or Dalits.|$|E

40|$|Studies {{indicate}} that while suppressing smoking thoughts increases subsequent smoking, {{it may have}} no impact on <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke. However, previous research has examined suppression of general smoking thoughts rather than thoughts specifically related <b>to</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke. The present study investigated whether suppression of thoughts of <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke results in subsequently elevated ratings of <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke. An experimental study {{examined the effects of}} suppressing thoughts of <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke, versus expressing thoughts of <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke, versus a control group thinking about anything, on ratings of <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke and tobacco withdrawal symptoms at four time points (before manipulations, just after manipulations, 5 min after, 10 min after). In addition, effects of suppressing thoughts of <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke on subsequent reports of thoughts of <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke were examined. Suppressing the thoughts of <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke caused thought rebound (i. e., greater subsequent reports of thoughts of <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke). However, compared with control groups, this suppression did not elevate subsequent ratings of <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke. Suppressing the thoughts of <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke does not elevate subsequent ratings of this desire. Increased cigarette consumption following suppression of smoking thoughts may be mediated by mechanisms other than increased <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke...|$|R

40|$|Is <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> eat in {{response}} to positive emotions an 'obese' eating style: a style more prevalent in people with obesity? In other words: Is Kummerspeck (German: sorrow-fat) for some people a misnomer? This question was addressed in three studies on women. Study 1 (n = 188) tested the moderator effect of subjective well-being on the association of BMI with the scale on <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> eat {{in response}} to negative emotions (DEBQ-E). Study 2 tested in women (n = 832) whether items on <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> eat {{in response to}} positive emotions loaded on the same factor as those in response to negative emotions and body mass. Study 3 assessed in the total sample (n = 203) and an overweight subsample (n = 40) a) whether self-reported <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> eat in response to positive emotions predicted actual food intake and b) whether this also held true over and above self-reported <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> eat in response to negative emotions. Study 1 showed only for women with low positive affect a significant positive association of BMI with DEBQ-E. In Study 2, only items on <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> eat in response to negative emotions loaded on the same factor as BMI. Study 3 : In the total sample, the significant effect on food intake of the scale on <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> eat in response to positive emotions disappeared when a scale on <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> eat in response to negative emotions {{was added to the}} model. In the overweight-subsample there was only an effect on food intake for <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> eat in response to negative emotions. It is concluded that only <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> eat in response to negative emotions is an 'obese' eating style, suggesting that Kummerspeck is not a misnomer...|$|R
