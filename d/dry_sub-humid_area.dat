In recent years, natural and anthropogenic factors have impacted climate variability and contributed to a large extent to climate change. Based on one degree gridded data of India Meteorological Department (IMD) for 34 years (1971 - 2004), climatic water balances are computed for 351 pixels in India and used for classifying in to six climate types following Thornthwaite’s moisture regime classification and areas falling under different climatic zones in India are delineated. Considerable changes in the country’s climate area observed between the two periods; 1971 - 90 and 1991 - 2004. Increased semi-arid area by 8. 45 M ha in five states viz., Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Punjab, and decreased semi-arid area by 5 M ha in eleven states, contributed to overall increase in SAT area of 3. 45 M ha in the country. Overall, there has been a net reduction of 10. 71 M ha in the <b>dry</b> <b>sub-humid</b> <b>area</b> in the country. Results indicated that dryness and wetness are increasing in different parts of the country in the place of moderate climates existing earlier in these regions.

40|$|The term “desertification” (which is {{somewhat}} misleading) is not applied to hyper-arid zones (deserts). It is used rather {{to refer to}} a process resulting from anthropocentric and natural factors, such as land over-exploitation, overgrazing, mechanized farming, bad irrigation practices, illegal and excessive logging, bush and forest fires and deforestation due to population increase; along with these human activities, a range of climatic factors are believed to influence the process of land degradation (year-round aridity, high variability in rainfall, recurrent drought and so on). Due to these multiple causes, combatting desertification involves a wide range of measures and contributes to combatting poverty, to structural reforms and to sustainable development.

30|$|It is {{a common}} {{misunderstanding}} that droughts cause desertification because dry periods are common in arid and semiarid lands and {{are part of the}} ebb and flow of climate in these regions (Walker 1997). Well-managed lands can recover from the dry segments of climate cycles when rainfall increases. However, continued land abuse from agriculture, grazing, forest harvesting, wildland fire, and mining during droughts certainly increases the potential for permanent land degradation (MacDonald 2000). Desertification results in the loss of the land’s proper hydrologic function, biological productivity, and other ecosystem services as a result of human activities and climate change (Black 1997; Walker 1997; Millenium Ecosystem Assessment 2005 a, b). Desertification affects one third of the earth’s surface and over a billion people. In the past, desertification was considered a problem of only arid, semiarid, and <b>dry</b> <b>sub-humid</b> <b>areas.</b> However, humid zones can also undergo desertification with the cumulative effects of human impacts (MacDonald 2000).

In Brazil, the most likely region to this process is the northeastern semi-arid region, where the Caatinga biome occurs, due to the dry climate of the area and human activities for the exploitation of natural resources and agricultural practices without proper management for soil conservation. As aggravating the situation there is the scenario of climate change that can alter the rainfall patterns in the region and the climate in general, increasing the desertification process. To prevent and combat this process, are used legal instruments and government programs that seek to provide guidelines for action and implement preventive and recovery practices in degraded and susceptible to desertification areas.

40|$|Mapping of {{desertification}} severity using {{expert system}} approach Abstract — Desertification is {{the degradation of}} land in arid, semi-arid and <b>dry</b> <b>sub-humid</b> <b>areas.</b> Reduction in biological potential of land is a severe threat for development; especially in developing countries, it can affect the overall production of the country. Regular and frequent assessment and mapping of desertification hazard zones is essential to monitor the desertification process. Methodology development for the assessment and mapping of desertification is a crucial task in this process. The current work utilises an expert system approach to map desertification severity. The knowledge-base of the expert system {{is derived from the}} knowledge of the expert. The parameters used to map desertification severity are land use/land cover (LU/LC) changes and rainfall trend. Analysis of satellite imagery provides the LU/LC dynamics which is a primary indicator for desertification. Aurangabad District (Maharashtra, India) is selected for analysis. It is a semi-arid region situated in central India. Validation of the methodology is done using a training set consisting of 80 ground-truth points collected from the study area. The proposed model is semi-generic in nature. It can be used to map and monitor desertification hazard frequently and efficiently using different temporal dataset for the same area. This model can be applied to other areas using the local ground-truth data and modifying the knowledge-base as per the local conditions. Rigorous desertification analysis commonly followed is very complex and highly data dependent unlike the current model. Hence this model can be applied for a preliminary estimation of desertification severity with acceptable accuracy using limited field data. This methodology can be extended using other available parameters for better accuracy. Agarwadkar Y. 1, Khire M. V. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Desertification is land {{degradation}} {{and loss of}} biological productivity in arid, semi-arid and <b>dry</b> <b>sub-humid</b> <b>areas</b> due to climatic variations and destructive human activities. Since the vegetative mass is the major biological production of drylands, one can consider the deterioration of plant cover as the main indicator of desertification process. Sistan plain is an arid region in south-eastern Iran that suffers from severe types of desertification and {{land degradation}}. To assess the trend of vegetation cover changes that was occured during 1990 - 2006 period we conducted a two-years study in the region. The basic tools that employed {{in this study were}} in-field sampled data, TM and ETM+ images plus with RS softwares. All needed processes were done including geometric and radiometric corrections, mosaicing, clipping, PCA and Tasseled cap. Field sampling was carried out in 26 sites with nine plots in each site. To determine the best vegetation index (VI), we evaluated 83 VIs, among them WDVI, TSAVI 2, MSAVI 1 and NDVI ab proved to be the best for separating and discriminating the plant cover on the images with correlation coefficients of 0. 89, 0. 86, 0. 84 and 0. 70, respectively. Then by applying an appropriate treshold, the images were classified in two categories: vegetation and non-vegetation. Kappa coefficients of resulted classification maps for four selected indices calculated using confusion matrix, suggesting that WDVI map is the the most accurate map. Finally, change detection map was obtained by subtracting images, showing that 11. 37 % (95288. 9 ha) of the study area experienced changes in vegetation cover from year 1990 to 2006. Of all changed area 89. 23 % belongs to Desertified class while just 10. 77 % of changed area indicates the Restoration.   KEYWORDS : desertification, trend, vegetation indices, WDVI, Sistan, vegetation cover  </p...|$|R
40|$|Desertification is the {{degradation}} of land in arid, semi-arid, and <b>dry</b> <b>sub-humid</b> <b>areas</b> and it is primarily due to human activities and climatic variations. Nowadays, this matter does not refer only {{to the expansion of}} existing deserts but it occurs because dryland ecosystems are extremely vulnerable to climate changes, over-exploitation and inappropriate land use. In the Italian scenario, the impact of desertification is restricted to the southern regions where the risk is linked to water erosion, strong human aggressiveness, intense precipitations and to water and soil salinization. To this respect, the Italian project RIADE (Integrated Research for Applying new technologies and processes for combating DEsertification), has selected the area of Syracuse and the alluvial plain of the Licata town for an integrated application of the hydrogeochemical and spectroscopical methods in order to settle on qualitative characteristics of the water resources. Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) spectroscopy has been chosen for its intrinsic skills to be employed in real time water quality parameter determinations, with portable instruments during intensive monitoring campaigns. This technique allows to perform qualitative and quantitative in situ determination of dissolved (humic and fulvic acids, pollutants) or particulate (phytoplankton) organic matter. The ENEA laser remote sensing laboratory has designed and developed a new portable instrument, in order to match the requests of monitoring skills on relevance sites for RIADE. In the late Spring 2005 (May 22 – 25), a joint campaign has been performed in the Licata area (Sicily, Agrigento province), along the Salso river and in different wells in the neighbourhood territory.

40|$|Forest {{plantations}} {{have been}} extensively used to combat desertification. In drylands, harsh climate conditions and unfertile soils often preclude seedling establishment. The improvement in seedling quality by manipulating nutrient availability {{could contribute to}} increase planting success. However, morpho-functional traits defining optimum seedling quality in drylands, and the fertilization schemes to achieve them, are still under discussion. Several studies suggest that well fertilized seedlings may perform better than nutrient limited seedlings in these environments. However, recent works have shown opposite results. In this review, we discuss the concept of seedling quality in drylands based on {{an evaluation of the}} effects of nutrient manipulation on seedling morpho-functional traits and field performance. According to existing data, we hypothesize that nutrient-limited small seedlings may be better adapted to arid environments and unfavorable microsites, where access to water is uncertain and a conservative water use strategy may be advantageous. In contrast, in <b>dry</b> <b>sub-humid</b> <b>areas,</b> areas with deep soils, protected from excess radiation, and areas where irrigation is feasible, well-fertilized big seedlings with high root growth potential may have more chances of success. We discuss this theory {{in the context of the}} multiple objectives of dryland restoration and the environmental constrains posed by these areas, and identify knowledge gaps that should be targeted to test our hypothesis.

40|$|International audienceDesertification {{is defined}} in the first art of the {{convention}} to combat desertification as "land degradation in arid, semiarid and <b>dry</b> <b>sub-humid</b> <b>areas</b> resulting from climatic variations and human activities". Its consequence include a set of important processes which are active in arid and semi arid environment, where water is the main limiting factor of land use performance in such ecosystem. Desertification indicators or the groups of associated indicators should be focused on a single process. They {{should be based on}} available reliable information sources, including remotely sensed images, topographic data (maps or DEM'S), climate, soils and geological data. The current work aims to map the Environmental Sensitivity Areas (ESA's) to desertification in whole territory of Egypt at a scale of 1 : 1 000 000. ETM satellite images, geologic and soil maps were used as main sources for calculating the index of Environmental Sensitivity Areas (ESAI) for desertification. The algorism is adopted from MEDALLUS methodology as follows; ESAI = (SQI * CQI * VQI) 1 / 3 Where SQI is the soil quality index, CQI is the climate quality index and VQI is the vegetation quality index. The SQI is based on rating the parent material, slope, soil texture, and soil depth. The VQI is computed on bases of rating three categories (i. e. erosion protection, drought resistance and plant cover). The CQI is based on the aridity index, derived from values of annual rainfall and potential evapotranspiration. Arc-GIS 9 software was used for the computation and sensitivity maps production. The results show that the soil of the Nile Valley are characterized by a moderate SQI, however the those in the interference zone are low soil quality indexed. The dense vegetation of the valley has raised its VQI to be good, however coastal areas are average and interference zones are low. The maps of ESA's for desertification show that 86. 1 % of Egyptian territory is classified as very sensitive areas, while 4. 3 % as Moderately sensitive, and 9. 6 % as sensitive. It can be concluded that implementing the maps of sensitivity to desertification is rather useful in the arid and semi arid areas as they give more likely quantitative trend for frequency of sensitive areas. The integration of different factors contributing to desertification sensitivity may lead to plan a successful combating. The usage of space data and GIS proved to be suitable tools to rely estimation and to fulfill the needed large computational requirements. They are also useful in visualizing the sensitivity situation of different desertification parameters...|$|R
40|$|The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) defines {{desertification}} as “land degradation in arid, semi-arid and <b>dry</b> <b>sub-humid</b> <b>areas</b> {{resulting from}} various factors, including climatic variations and human activities”. Desertification {{is regarded as}} one of the major global environmental problems of the 21 st century and the African sub-Sahara is often quoted as the most seriously affected region with a significant loss of biological and economic productivity of the land. In this geographic area, desertification processes are usually generated by soil erosion due to climate characteristics and fluctuations, unsustainable land uses, overgrazing and inappropriate agricultural practices. Preventing desertification requires an improved understanding of its causes, impact, degree and association with climate, soil, water, land cover, socio-economic factors and their combined effects. The development of methodologies capable of managing large amounts of data in an integrated approach is needed because of the complexity and variety of forms of desertification processes. The study was carried out within the FP 7 -ENV- 2010 CLUVA project (CLimate change and Urban Vulnerability in Africa), aimed to estimate the sensitivity to land degradation in the urban and peri-urban areas of both Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) and Saint Louis (Senegal) cities. The approach was based on the implementation and adaptation of the modeling methodology developed within the MEDALUS project (MEditerranean Desertification and Land Use). The model is characterized by a multi-factor approach based on the assessment of both environmental quality indicators (climate, soil, vegetation) and anthropogenic factors (land management). The methodology is adaptable to the local conditions, considering that some key indicators can be operationally defined through the inclusion or exclusion of parameters and the scores assigned in order to match the specific relevance of the factors. All local data, arranged in a GIS environment, allowed the generation of maps identifying Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESAs) and Indices of Environmental Sensitivity (ESAI). As expected, the results highlighted an overall high sensitivity to desertification. In Ouagadougou, the poorly vegetated peri-urban zone, affected by an increasing demographic pressure as the result of immigration from surrounding rural areas, was found as the most vulnerable area; in Saint Louis, the critical zones were located mostly in the northern part of the study area, where both low quality of soil and overexploitation of vegetation, due to grazing and domestic use, increase the sensitivity to desertification. The described methodological approach has a potential to represent a valuable tool to orientate effective policies preventing and mitigating land degradation processes. Model validation and comparison with other widely applied methods to assess desertification are in progress...|$|R
40|$|The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD, 1994) {{addressed}} desertification as {{a global}} problem defining it as “land degradation in arid, semi-arid, and <b>dry</b> <b>sub-humid</b> <b>areas,</b> resulting from various factors, including climate variations and human activity”. In the Mediterranean areas, this phenomenon results from the interaction of {{various factors such as}} climate, lithology, vegetation and land use. The study of the predisposing factors allows the time/space assessment of the phenomenon and a continuous field monitoring allows to quantify the data in terms of vulnerability degree and to develop decision-making tools for integrated land use planning. One of the most fragile ecosystems are the badlands areas in Sicily. Their geological and climatic features (erosive rocks and marginal soils, and highly variable rainfall) and often a negative human impacts (inadequate land use and agricultural practices) led to increasing soil erosion and vegetation degradation, predisposing the terrain to the badlands. Moreover, the slope topography can be considered as a driver factor for the inception and the evolution of the badlands, in particular if we considered the badlands as miniature drainage systems, fully comparable to small river basins. The present work focused {{on the role of the}} pre-incision slope topography on the typologies and characteristics of the Sicilian badlands. The badlands areas of the entire Sicily were mapped in order to create an inventory of landforms based on morphological criteria. The digital orthophotos (2007 - 2008) at a nominal scale of 1 : 10. 000 available in the WebGIS server of the Regione Sicilia and the Google Earth images of the same periods were closely examined. The landforms were digitized as polygons by means of a GIS software and recorded into a geo-database. The channel networks of each badland were traced and their drainage density (D) were calculated. The numbers of furrows directly tributary to the external drainage network were measured by using the index Gully Tributary (GT). This allowed to distinguish two typologies of badlands drainage pattern: dendritic for GT= 1 (with only one main furrow) and parallel for GT> 1 (with several parallel furrows). For each landform, the pre-erosion topography was reconstructed by filling the incision, using the heights of the watershed divide as point values in a topography interpolation tool in GIS. It represented the slope topography prior to the development of the current drainage network. The pre-incision slope morphometry of each landform was characterized by calculating the Morphometric Slope Index (MSI) considered as general index for slope morphometry. MSI, GT and D were compared via statistics in order to detect the influence of pre-erosion slope morphometry on the typology and the arrangement of the badlands drainage networks...|$|R

Due to the general lack of available water, the semi-arid part of the island is dominated by poor marquis vegetation, while olive trees, oak and pine forests prevail in the <b>dry</b> <b>sub-humid</b> part under similar topogaphical and geomorphological conditions. Vegetation cover increases with increasing rainfall and soil depth. Slope grade has a variable effect on soil erosion in the various climatic zones. Erosion is decreasing with increasing rainfall for the same slope classes. Severely eroded soils prevail in the semi-arid zone with slopes greater than 12 %, while slightly to moderately eroded soils are found in the <b>dry</b> <b>sub-humid</b> zone under similar slope classes. The highest rates of land degradation have been measured in areas with soils formed on pyroclastic formations. Areas with soils formed on basic igneous rocks, shale and lava are well vegetated and protected from erosion under a broad range of slopes and weather conditions.

50|$|Drylands {{are defined}} by a {{scarcity}} of water. Drylands are zones where precipitation is balanced by evaporation from surfaces and transpiration by plants (evapotranspiration). UNEP defines drylands as tropical and temperate areas with an aridity index of less than 0.65. The drylands can be classified into four sub-types: <b>dry</b> <b>sub-humid</b> lands, semi-arid lands, arid lands, and hyper-arid lands.

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} farmers’ preferences for goat breeds, desired traits, management and breeding practices in agro-pastoral communities {{of central and eastern}} Tanzania. A total of 552 goat keepers from semi-arid and <b>sub-humid</b> <b>areas</b> were involved. Information on goat flock size, breed preferences, breeding practices, traits preferred and husbandry practices was collected using a well structured questionnaire. Out of the 552 household heads, only 21. 3 % were women. Most of the farmers kept indigenous goats belonging to the Small East African breed and the mean number of goats per household was 8. 9 ± 1. 0. The majority of the farmers (53. 4 %) preferred to keep the Small East African goat breed rather than the exotic breeds. The Small East African breed was preferred to exotic breeds because the animals are easier to feed, prolific, tolerant to drought and endemic diseases. Most farmers (70. 8 %) practiced uncontrolled mating using bucks from either their own flock (66. 7 %) or neighbours’ flocks (33. 3 %). Uncontrolled mating was preferred because it is easier to practice (41. 2 %) and cheaper (41. 2 %). The buck to doe ratio was 1 : 3 in semi-arid and 1 : 2 in <b>sub-humid</b> <b>areas.</b> Breeding males were selected based on body size by the majority (85 %) of the goat farmers. It is concluded that livestock keepers in semi-arid and <b>sub-humid</b> <b>areas</b> in Tanzania prefer the Small East Africa goats because the animals are abundantly available and well adapted to the local environmental conditions.
