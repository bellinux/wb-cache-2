40|$|X-ray {{diffraction}} (XRD) scan {{profiles of}} {{medium carbon steel}} ground samples were analyzed to assess the grinding induced plastic deformation. Broadening of XRD scan profiles with higher <b>downfeed</b> indicated the possible plastic deformation. XRD scan profiles were studied to measure full width at half maximum (FWHM) of profiles for assessment of plastic deformation at various level of <b>downfeed.</b> FWHM analysis revealed that FWHM increases with <b>downfeed</b> owing to plastic deformation. Grain size of deformed layers was also estimated using Scherrer equation to verify the results obtained through FWHM analysis. Grain size was observed to decrease with <b>downfeed</b> due to associated plastic deformation. Assessment of grinding induced plastic deformation using XRD profiles demonstrated the applicability of this new approach for qualitative measurement of surface integrity characteristics like microhardness and surface roughness. Microhardness measurement and surface roughness analysis of ground samples have been undertaken to confirm the results obtained by FWHM stud...|$|E

Moinuddin observed that the buildings that did not participate may have had a lower standard of maintenance than those that did. The data was used in a fault-tree analysis to estimate sprinkler system reliability for upfeed (water supplied from the base of the building) and <b>downfeed</b> (water supplied by gravity from above) configurations.|$|E
40|$|A {{necessary}} goal in {{the study}} of grinding advanced ceramic materials is to define grinding conditions that will machine ceramic components economically while maintaining dimensional accuracy and surface integrity of the resulting parts. In view of the high price of diamond wheels, which are the optimum choice for machining ceramics, it is important to investigate the process of diamond-wheel wear in grinding ceramic materials. Little information is currently available on the rates of diamond-wheel wear in grinding ceramic materials. This thesis processes a new method of measuring wheel wear using a duplication pattern of the grinding wheel. Plunge-grinding experiments on sintered silicon nitride (SSN) and sintered reaction-bonded silicon nitride (SRBSN) were conducted using a horizontal-spindle surface grinder with diamond-grit, resin-bond peripheral wheels. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the wear process, grinding forces were measured using a computer-based data-acquisition system. Stylus profilometry served to measure the volumetric wheel wear and to measure the surface roughness of the ground silicon nitride for the purpose of characterizing the effect of wheel wear on the grinding performance. Major contributions of this thesis research include development of a method for measuring wear of diamond grinding wheels, and identification of the interrelation between the rate of wheel wear and the two machining parameters (namely, <b>downfeed</b> and wheel speed used in the investigation) ...|$|E
