5000|$|Today, {{flexible}} circuits {{which are}} also variously known around the world variously as <b>flexible</b> <b>printed</b> <b>wiring,</b> flex print, flexi circuits, are used many products. Large credit {{is due to the}} efforts of Japanese electronics packaging engineers who have found countless new ways to employ flexible circuit technology. For the last decade, flexible circuits have remained {{one of the fastest growing}} of all interconnection product market segments. A more recent variation on flexible circuit technology is one called [...] "flexible electronics" [...] which commonly involves the integration of both active and passive functions in the processing.|$|E

It specialized in complex flexible circuit assemblies and specialized <b>printed</b> <b>wiring</b> boards for both the U.S. military and space programs including the Saturn V and Lunar Excursion Module. Sanders also produced flexible circuity for most other commercial applications including medical equipment. Sanders Flexprint division was involved with producing <b>printed</b> <b>wiring</b> boards and flex circuitry for all branches of the military and for all platforms. The Flexprint division was sold in the late seventies or early eighties.|$|R
40|$|The {{functional}} {{density of}} electronic systems is unfailingly increasing since four decades {{and is expected}} to continue so at least within the predictable future. In electronic packaging technology strategies for densification are, however, not as streamlined as in semiconductor industries. In Europe {{over the past three years}} efforts have been made to enable functional integration on the system level by direct embedding of chips into printed wiring boards. In the EU funded projects HIDING DIES and SHIFT industrial and academic partners are combining their expertise to achieve stable technology platforms for highest integration. In the present paper two basic technology approaches and results will be presented. In the Chip in Polymer (CIP) technology silicon chips with a thickness between 50 and 80 µm are attached onto a structured core layer of a rigid printed wiring board with very high precision. The core is the laminated with resin coated copper foil on both sides, thereby embedding the chip into the build up layer. Subsequently laser vias are drilled and metallized to the chip bond pads. In the last step the outer copper sheets are structured and interconnected by either mechanical through holes or laser vias. The second approach, Flip Chip in Flex, aims at even thinner system build ups. Here an ultra thin flip chip (20 µm) is mounted onto a structured <b>flexible</b> <b>printed</b> <b>wiring</b> board (thickness 25 µm) and embedded into the build up layer by lamination. Contacts to different layers in the multilayered board are provided by through holes. The pros and contras of each technology will be discussed. In all of these technologies thin silicon chips are embedded into rigid or <b>flexible</b> <b>printed</b> <b>wiring</b> boards and connected either by laser vias or solder contacts. Process technologies, thermo-mechanical simulations of embedded chips, reliability results will be presented and discussed...|$|E
40|$|An {{electronic}} control unit has been fabricated and tested that can be replicated as a universal interface between the electronic infrastructure of a spacecraft and a brushless-motor (or other electromechanical actuator) driven mechanism that performs a specific mechanical function within the overall spacecraft system. The unit includes interfaces {{to a variety of}} spacecraft sensors, power outputs, and has selectable actuator control parameters making the assembly a mechanism controller. Several control topologies are selectable and reconfigurable at any time. This allows the same actuator to perform different functions during the mission life of the spacecraft. The unit includes complementary metal oxide/semiconductor electronic components on a circuit board of a type called rigid flex (signifying <b>flexible</b> <b>printed</b> <b>wiring</b> along with a rigid substrate). The rigid flex board is folded to make the unit fit into a housing {{on the back of a}} motor. The assembly has redundant critical interfaces, allowing the controller to perform time-critical operations when no human interface with the hardware is possible. The controller is designed to function over a wide temperature range without the need for thermal control, including withstanding significant thermal cycling, making it usable in nearly all environments that spacecraft or landers will endure. A prototype has withstood 1, 500 thermal cycles between 120 and + 85 C without significant deterioration of its packaging or electronic function. Because there is no need for thermal control and the unit is addressed through a serial bus interface, the cabling and other system hardware are substantially reduced in quantity and complexity, with corresponding reductions in overall spacecraft mass and cost...|$|E
