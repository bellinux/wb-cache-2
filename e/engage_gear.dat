50|$|Additionally, traffic {{regulations}} {{in a large}} number of countries require trucks to always drive with an <b>engaged</b> <b>gear,</b> which in turn provides a certain amount of engine braking (viscous losses to the engine oil and air pumped through the engine and friction losses to the cylinder walls and bearings) when no accelerator pedal is applied.|$|R

50|$|Such {{gearboxes}} {{had been}} built before, but neither widely used nor successfully. Porsche had used one for his 1907 Maja, {{with a series of}} internal pawls inside the shaft which could be pushed out one-by-one to <b>engage</b> the <b>gears.</b> Goggomobil and Claude Hill of Ferguson, had both used an internal 'bung' sliding inside the shaft to push out a locking cam or balls through the hollow shaft and <b>engage</b> the <b>gears.</b> Archie Butterworth's AJB Special had used a sleeve over a solid shaft, the sleeve sliding lengthways to <b>engage</b> the <b>gears</b> and also to act as the other gear's bearing surface. The Butterworth design was the one chosen. The designs were so similar that Chapman initially negotiated with Butterworth for the rights to use it, but without any final agreement.|$|R
50|$|There can be {{significant}} backlash in unsynchronized transmissions {{because of the}} intentional gap between dog gears (also known as dog clutches). The gap is necessary so that the driver or electronics can <b>engage</b> the <b>gears</b> easily while synchronizing the engine speed with the driveshaft speed. If there was a smaller clearance, it would be nearly impossible to <b>engage</b> the <b>gears</b> because the teeth would interfere {{with each other in}} most configurations. In synchronized transmissions, synchromesh solves this problem.|$|R
40|$|A design {{methodology}} is presented for dynamical observers of hybrid systems with linear continuous-time dynamics that reconstruct the complete state (discrete location and continuous state) from {{the knowledge of}} the inputs and outputs of a hybrid plant. Given a current-location observable living hybrid system with minimum dwell-time, we prove that exponential ultimate boundedness for an hybrid observer can always be achieved. We also prove that the observer correctly identifies (apart from an initial finite number of transitions) the sequence of hybrid system locations even when the complementary outputs are generated with some delay with respect to the corresponding transitions in the plant. We then present the application of the theory to the problem of on–line identification of the actual <b>engaged</b> <b>gear</b> for a car, an important contribution.

50|$|In {{the typical}} manual gearbox for a RWD car, the driving shaft (input) is in-line with the driven shaft (output), but not {{permanently}} connected to it. A reduction gear on the driving shaft drives the layshaft. In car transmissions, the term countershaft is also used. A {{number of gears}} on the layshaft may then be connected, one at a time, to the driven shaft. Selecting each of these gears in turn gives the various ratios of the gearbox. All of these gear ratios are reduction gears, the engine speed being higher than the input speed to the final drive of the rear axle. Early gearboxes used sliding <b>gears</b> to <b>engage</b> and disengage the drive. These were difficult to operate and also wore on the main working surfaces of the gears. An early improvement was to use separate dog clutches instead to <b>engage</b> <b>gears,</b> leaving the gears themselves in 'constant mesh'. A later, and more gradual development, was the introduction of synchromesh. This is an all-metal friction clutch {{in addition to the}} positive dog clutch, that gradually <b>engages</b> the <b>gears</b> and matches their speed before the dog clutch engages.|$|R
50|$|Reverse (R): This <b>engages</b> reverse <b>gear</b> {{within the}} transmission, {{permitting}} {{the vehicle to}} be driven backward, and operates a switch {{to turn on the}} white backup lights for improved visibility (the switch may also activate a beeper on delivery trucks or other large vehicles to audibly warn other drivers and nearby pedestrians of the driver's reverse movement). To select reverse in most transmissions, the driver must come to a complete stop, depress the shift-lock button (or move the shift lever toward the driver in a column shifter, or move the shifter sideways along a notched channel in a console shifter) and select reverse. The driver should avoid engaging reverse while the vehicle is moving forwards, and likewise avoid <b>engaging</b> any forward <b>gear</b> while travelling backwards. On transmissions with a torque converter, doing so at very low speed (walking pace) is not harmful, but causes unnecessary wear on clutches and bands, and a sudden deceleration that not only is uncomfortable, but also uncontrollable since the brakes and the throttle contribute in the same direction. This sudden acceleration, or jerk, can still be felt when <b>engaging</b> the <b>gear</b> at standstill, but the driver normally suppresses this by holding the brakes. Travelling slowly in the right direction while <b>engaging</b> the <b>gear</b> minimizes the jerk further, which is actually beneficial to the wearing parts of the transmission. Electronically controlled transmissions may behave differently, as <b>engaging</b> a <b>gear</b> at speed is essentially undefined behaviour. Some modern transmissions have a safety mechanism that will resist putting the car in reverse when the vehicle is moving forward; such a mechanism may consist of a solenoid-controlled physical barrier {{on either side of the}} reverse position, electronically engaged by a switch on the brake pedal, so that the brake pedal needs to be depressed in order to allow the selection of reverse. Some electronic transmissions prevent or delay engagement of reverse gear altogether while the car is moving.|$|R

This paper presents a numerical method to predict the mechanical and thermal behaviour of fibre reinforced plastic cylindrical gears and its experimental validation.

This numerical simulation computes the load sharing between instantaneously <b>engaged</b> <b>gears</b> and provides results such as contact pressure, tooth root stress or transmission error. The numerical results are then compared to experimental measures on a test bench developed at the LaMCoS laboratory. This comparison allows the validation of the load sharing model...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Automotive transmission rattle is the noise generated due to impacts between manual transmissions meshing gear teeth {{in the presence of}} backlash. It {{is considered to be a}} Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH) phenomenon and is originated due to combustion irregularities (engine order vibrations), especially in diesel vehicles. This thesis focuses in the case of creep rattle for the MMT 6 Ford Getrag transmission (six speeds plus reverse) with a DW 10 b, 4 -cylinder, 4 -stroke, 2. 0 litres diesel engine. This particular rattle condition is fundamentally similar to any other where an <b>engaged</b> <b>gear</b> is pertained (drive, over-run or float), with the 1 st or 2 nd <b>gear</b> <b>engaged</b> at a very low engine speed. The numerical models include an initial single degree of freedom (DoF) simulation. It comprises either of the <b>engaged</b> <b>gear</b> pair under Hertzian contact conditions or of a loose gear pair under hydrodynamic regime of lubrication. Once the validity of this model is established and correlated with the results obtained from a single gear pair test rig, simulations of increasing complexity can be envisaged. A 7 DoF numerical model is, therefore, developed. The Hertzian contact model still prevails for the <b>engaged</b> <b>gear</b> pair, whereas an analytical hydrodynamic solution is implemented for the remaining 6 loose gear wheels and Petrov s law is applied to the needle bearings retaining the gear wheels. With the aim of accommodating a fully lubricated model of all the tribological conjunctions, an analytical elastohydrodynamic (EHL) Grubin type algorithm is employed. Also, the energy equation is analytically solved for hydrodynamic and elastohydrodynamic conjunctions, based on the assumptions dictated by the Peclet number. Therefore, under hydrodynamic conditions, the energy equation is governed by viscous heating and convective cooling, whereas in the EHL conjunctions the governing terms are viscous and compressive heating, together with conductive cooling. The retaining needle bearings follow the same heat generation mechanism as journal bearings. The effective viscosity, as obtained from the Houpert s equation accounting for pressure and thermal effects, is fundamental for the study of the friction in the contact. The hydrodynamic contacts are only governed by viscous friction, whereas EHL conjunctions exhibit asperity iv interactions as well as viscous effects. The results obtained from this new 7 DoF model are then compared to the experimental measurements taken from the vehicle tests and various purpose-built drivetrain rigs. A metric named Impulsion Ratio is hereby introduced, aiming to shed some light into the predictions obtained by the various models presented. This metric is the ratio of driving over resistive forces acting on each individual gear wheel. Its use is tested to predict single or double-sided rattle scenarios and, therefore, ascertaining higher and lower rattle levels. The 13 DoF model from which these conclusions were obtained includes shafts planar translation and rocking moments. The rolling element bearings supporting the shafts are, therefore, modelled to capture the inherent frequencies arising from their motion. The final model introduces the effects of transient thermo-elastohydrodynamics. This 7 DoF dynamic model accounts for a numerical solution of Reynolds equation with Elrod s cavitation algorithm for simultaneous teeth in mesh. The results obtained validate the previously used Grubin assumption by comparing the predicted central film thickness along the full mesh of one tooth. Also, the effect of starved input conditions and thermal and isothermal solutions are studied...|$|R

40|$|Noise, {{vibration}} and harshness (NVH) refinement {{as well as}} thermo-mechanical efficiency are the key design {{attributes of}} modern compact multi-speed transmissions. Therefore, unlike simple gear pair models, a full transmission model is required for a simultaneous study. The prominent NVH concern is transmission rattle, dominated by the intermittent unintended meshing of several lightly loaded unselected loose gear pairs arising from the system compactness. These gear pairs are subject to hydrodynamic impacts. The thermo-mechanical efficiency {{is dominated by the}} <b>engaged</b> <b>gears,</b> with simultaneous meshing of teeth pairs subject to thermo-elastohydrodynamic regime of lubrication, with often quite thin films, promoting asperity interactions. Therefore, a full transmission model is presented, comprising system dynamics, lubricated contacts, asperity interactions and thermal balance. Generic multi-physics models of this type are a prerequisite for in-depth analysis of transmission efficiency and operational refinement.

50|$|The nut {{and screw}} have {{identical}} multiple-start threads. The rollers have a single-start thread with an angle matching the nut thread. The matched thread angle prevents axial movement between the nut and the roller as the rollers spin. The nut assembly includes spacer rings and ring gears that position and guide the rollers.

The ring gears time the spinning and orbit of the rollers about the screw axis by <b>engaging</b> <b>gear</b> teeth near {{the ends of the}} rollers. The spacer rings rotate on axis with the screw in unison with the orbit of the rollers. The spacer rings float relative to the nut, axially secured by retaining rings, because they spin around the screw at a lower frequency (angular velocity) than the nut.|$|R
