40|$|Partial {{oxidation}} (POX), catalytic {{steam reforming}} (CSR) and autothermal reforming (ATR) {{are some of}} the main processes widely used to produce hydrogen. Autothermal Reformer also defines as a steam reforming reaction and a partial oxidation reaction that take place over microscopic distances at the same catalytic site thus avoiding complex heat exchanging. The steam reforming reaction absorbs part of the heat generated by the partial oxidation process reaction, limiting the maximum temperature in the reactor. For a catalytically ignited autothermal reformer system, catalysts need to be preheated to its light- off or catalytic ignition temperature before the reactions can be self-sustained. The objective of this research is to come out with the practical method for starting-up an autothermal reformer system in the shortest possible preheating time. A catalytic burner has been proposed to supply the required energy for pre- heating the autothermal reactor. This proposed catalytic burner will use available hydrogen and natural gas as fuel and platinum on the honeycomb monolith surface as catalyst. Platinum-type catalyst can readily reacts hydrogen with air under room temperature to produce heats that aid the catalyst to reach light off temperature. The energy from catalytic combustion will be used to preheat the autothermal reformer. Ceramic honeycomb monolith with platinum based washcoat will be used a burner system. The results will then be further verified using CFD-ACE code and as well as compared with that of conventional preheating methods such as <b>electrical</b> <b>coil...</b>|$|E
40|$|Impedance {{method has}} been {{explored}} for damage detection and identification. Typically, when the impedance sensor is integrated onto the mechanical structure to be monitored, its electrical impedance {{is directly related}} to the mechanical impedance of the host structure. Thus the change of impedance measurement before and after damage occurrence can be used as the damage indicator. Since the impedance information may be measured at relatively high frequency range, the impedance method could be sensitive to small-sized damage. Generally, piezoelectric transducers are employed in the impedance approach, which can serve as actuator and sensor simultaneously. In this research, a magnetic transducer approach is investigated for impedance based damage detection. To provide design guidelines, the analytical model of the resistive magnetic impedance measurement circuit is formulated. During the formulation, the two-way magneto-mechanical coupling between the transducer and the structure is systematically studied by using the Maxwell’s equations. The preliminary sensor enhancement is achieved by selecting the number of turns of wire in the <b>electrical</b> <b>coil.</b> Moreover, in order to reduce the negative effects of the high inherent inductance and large parasitic resistance of the coil with a large number of turns of wire, a new measurement circuitry is proposed, in which a negative resistive element and a capacitor are introduced to be serially connected with the original resistive circuit. Correlated numerical and experimental studies are carried out to validate the magnetic transducer in impedance based damage detection. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{basic idea}} of impedance-based damage {{detection}} is that, through multi-field coupling, the electrical impedance of an impedance sensor {{can be directly}} related to the mechanical impedance of the structure to which the sensor is attached. Therefore, damage effect can be reflected in the change of the sensor impedance curves before and after damage occurrence. As the impedance information can be extracted in high frequency range for many transducer materials, such method is sensitive to small-sized damage. Moreover, {{it can be used to}} identify both the location and severity of damage once the explicit relation between the impedance measurements and a high-fidelity model is established. ^ The first part of this dissertation is dedicated to improving the piezoelectric impedance-based sensing. First, an inverse sensitivity-based method, based on the spectral element method that is particularly suitable for high-frequency analysis, is developed for damage identification. Then, a new piezoelectric impedance sensor design with the integration of a tunable inductive circuitry is proposed. It is shown that this inductive circuitry can amplify remarkably both the impedance measurement and the anomaly amplification, thereby improving the detection sensitivity and robustness. It is also shown that further enhancement can be accomplished by integrating a negative capacitance element. ^ The second part of this dissertation discusses extending the circuitry integration concept to magnetic transducer. Since direct contact is not needed for magnetic transducer-based impedance sensing, this approach can be applied to structures with complex geometry and also can facilitate movable sensor design. One straightforward way of increasing the generally low magneto-mechanical coupling is to increase the number of turns of wire in the <b>electrical</b> <b>coil</b> of the sensor, which, however, increases the inherent inductance and parasitic resistance. Inspired by the piezoelectric circuitry integration concept, a tunable capacitive circuitry is integrated into the magnetic sensor to improve the detection sensitivity. Based on a newly established analytical model of the magneto-mechanically integrated system, comprehensive case studies are performed to elucidate the parametric influences. ^ Throughout this dissertation, numerical/analytical results are correlated to experimental results. Guidelines for the optimal design, tuning, and placement of the sensors are analyzed systematically. ...|$|E
40|$|The cold-crucible {{induction}} melter (CCIM) design eliminates many {{materials and}} operating constraints inherent in joule-heated melter (JHM) technology, {{which is the}} standard for vitrification of high-activity wastes worldwide. The cold-crucible design is smaller, less expensive, and generates much less waste for ultimate disposal. It should also allow a much more flexible operating envelope, which will be crucial if the heterogeneous wastes at the DOE reprocessing sites are to be vitrified. A joule-heated melter operates by passing current between water-cooled electrodes through a molten pool in a refractory-lined chamber. This design is inherently limited by susceptibility of materials to corrosion and melting. In addition, redox conditions and free metal content have exacerbated materials problems or lead to electrical short-circuiting causing failures in DOE melters. In contrast, the CCIM design is based on inductive coupling of a water-cooled high-frequency <b>electrical</b> <b>coil</b> with the glass, causing eddycurrents that produce heat and mixing. A critical difference is that inductance coupling transfers energy through a nonconductive solid layer of slag coating the metal container inside the coil, whereas the jouleheated design relies on passing current through conductive molten glass {{in direct contact with}} the metal electrodes and ceramic refractories. The frozen slag in the CCIM design protects the containment and eliminates the need for refractory, while the corrosive molten glass can be the limiting factor in the JH melter design. The CCIM design also eliminates the need for electrodes that typically limit operating temperature to below 1200 degrees C. While significant marketing claims have been made by French and Russian technology suppliers and developers, little data is available for engineering and economic evaluation of the technology, and no facilities are available in the US to support testing. A currently funded project at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL), is providing preliminary data on the CCIM technology using a small laboratory unit at the Khlopin Radium Institute in St. Petersburg Russia with INEEL Sodium Bearing Waste surrogate. The task includes both the baseline borosilicate glass and a new iron-phosphate glass developed at the University of Missouri-Rolla, which may offer significant advantages in compatibility with greater concentrations of highly refractory oxides. This project is integrating two disparate advances to develop a system with strong potential for benefit to the Department of Energy. Collaborative development of basic physical parameter data on the CCIM using promising glass formulations is being conducted by University of Missouri - Rolla, Russian and American researchers...|$|E
