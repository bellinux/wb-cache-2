5|$|Equally, Gaudí {{stood out}} as {{interior}} decorator, decorating {{most of his}} buildings personally, from the <b>furnishings</b> to the smallest details. In each case {{he knew how to}} apply stylistic particularities, personalising the decoration according to the owner's taste, the predominant style of the arrangement or its place in the surroundings—whether urban or natural, secular or religious. Many of his works were related to liturgical furnishing. From the design of a desk for his office {{at the beginning of his}} career to the <b>furnishings</b> designed for the Sobrellano Palace of Comillas, he designed all furnishing of the Vicens, Calvet, Batlló and Milà houses, of the Güell Palace and the Bellesguard Tower, and the liturgical furnishing of the Sagrada Família. It is noteworthy that Gaudí studied some ergonomy in order to adapt his <b>furnishings</b> to human anatomy. Many of his <b>furnishings</b> are exhibited at Gaudi House Museum.|$|E

5|$|From 1911 to 1917, {{money was}} {{collected}} for interior <b>furnishings,</b> which were relatively sparse {{apart from the}} impressive main altar. (These original <b>furnishings</b> remained until the 1930s.) Parts of the draft plan were abandoned: the floor was not constructed from marble as intended, but poured from plain concrete; outside there were no pinnacles on the façade. Writings vary on when the pinnacles were built: some claim they were built in 1923, but others argue {{that they were not}} completed until the renovation of the cathedral in 1999. Observers that argue for an earlier construction date state that they were damaged during World WarII and left dismantled for some time.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} <b>furnishings,</b> many {{of which}} the Marquess removed in 1950, have mostly been recovered and returned to their original locations in the castle.

5|$|Anne's daughter, Margaret, married John Tufton, the Earl of Thanet. John's son, Thomas, {{stripped}} the castle around 1695 {{to support the}} reconstruction of Appleby Castle. The <b>furnishings</b> were sold in 1714 and in 1763 much of the stone from Clifford's Tower was plundered {{for use in the}} construction of Brough Mill; the castle was subsequently completely abandoned. The south-west corner of the keep partially collapsed around 1800.|$|E

His main sculptor was Thomas Nicholls, together with another long-time collaborator, the Italian sculptor Ceccardo Fucigna.|$|E
5|$|From about 1560, the Reformation revolutionised church {{architecture}} in Scotland. Calvinists rejected ornamentation in places of worship.

There was a need to adapt old buildings and build new churches suitable for reformed services, particularly by putting the pulpit and preaching at the centre of worship.|$|E
5|$|In April 1885, the Cosmos Club {{considered}} {{purchasing the}} house from the Tayloe family.

The Cosmos Club declined to buy the home after an investigation found {{that the cost of}} upgrading the Tayloe property for its use would be too costly.|$|E

5|$|Italian silk cloth {{was very}} expensive, {{as much a}} result {{of the cost of the}} raw {{material}} as of the production costs. The craftsmen in Italy proved unable to keep up with the exigencies of French fashion, which continuously demanded lighter and less expensive materials. These materials were used for clothing, and garment production began to be done locally. Nevertheless, Italian silk long remained among the most prized, mostly for <b>furnishings</b> and the brilliant colours of the dyes.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Amy and Rory, {{while taking}} the lift down, {{suddenly}} {{find themselves in}} {{what appears to be}} an eighteenth-century house, but shortly discover most of the <b>furnishings</b> are wooden props.

Amy and Rory witness one transformation and try to flee, but Amy is caught and becomes a doll herself, joining the others in chasing Rory.|$|E
5|$|On November 4, 1824, {{just months}} after the election, the state capitol {{building}} was destroyed by a fire. Some <b>furnishings</b> and records were saved, but the four-year-old building was a total loss. When Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette toured the United States in 1825, a new capitol {{had not yet been}} constructed and the governor's mansion was too small to host a proper reception, so the governor had to entertain the dignitary at Weisiger's Tavern.|$|E
5|$|Puddletown's parish {{church has}} {{significant}} architectural interest, particularly its <b>furnishings</b> and monuments. It has a 12th-century font and well-preserved woodwork, including 17th-century box pews. Thomas Hardy {{took an interest}} in the church, and the village provided the inspiration for the fictional settlement of Weatherbury in his novel Far from the Madding Crowd; Weatherbury Farm, the home of principal character Bathsheba Everdene, is based on a manor house within the parish.|$|E
5|$|Starting in January 2005, {{the mansion}} closed {{for almost three}} years as it {{underwent}} the major restoration project. As part of the 2005–07 renovations, the drawing room and two bedchambers were completely refurbished. The drawing room's <b>furnishings</b> were extensively researched to reflect accurately the Mansion in the 1830–60 period. The ornate cupola atop the mansion was restored, including the spherical ornament above the cupola, which was refinished in gold leaf. The Hampton Mansion re-opened to the public on November 30, 2007.|$|E
5|$|The {{church was}} {{assigned}} as a historic monument by decree of 10 September 1913, {{only to have}} its stained glass smashed during a Zeppelin bombardment on 15 January 1915, falling through the roof.

The building experienced extensive damage during World War II, and was partially rebuilt, {{although much of the}} old altar and <b>furnishings</b> were not replaced.|$|E

5|$|The first camp {{opened on}} May 15, 1941 near Baltimore, Maryland. A total of 152 camps and units were {{established}} {{over the next}} six years. The federal government provided work projects, housing, camp <b>furnishings</b> and paid for transportation to the camps. The responsibilities of the churches included day-to-day management of the camps, subsistence costs, meals and healthcare for the men. When the young men arrived at the first camps, they started a six-month experiment that would extend to six years.|$|E
