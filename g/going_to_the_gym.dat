[...] She tried [...] "silence and evasion," [...] yoga, Tai Chi, <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gym,</b> all with no results.

50|$|Two {{hours after}} the nine {{officers}} had assembled outside, Ichihashi left the apartment barefoot and wearing a rucksack. Ichihashi was {{made aware of the}} situation and tried to run away from the officers. One officer grabbed his rucksack but Ichihashi continued to flee. None of the officers had radios so the officers on the fourth floor could not alert those on the ground. Ichihashi eluded the officers by vaulting the last few feet of <b>the</b> stairway <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground, but he was later rediscovered wearing a pair of athletic shoes. He escaped again by zig-zagging through the street. The rucksack contained his gym clothes, which police believed he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> wash at <b>the</b> <b>gym.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A crime wave, {{including}} a holdup at a nightclub that {{ends in a}} murder and a bank robbery in which a guard is killed, has hit Center City. A squad of FBI agents headed by inspector George A. Briggs meets with local FBI field officer Richard Atkins, police chief Bernard Harmatz and Police Commissioner Ralph Demory. After Briggs interrogates suspect Robert Danker, who claims he {{was not involved in}} either killing and that he has been framed, various tests are run at the FBI laboratory in Washington that exonerate Danker. Later Danker, who has been bailed out by [...] "John Smith," [...] is found stabbed <b>to</b> death.

40|$|A {{few years}} ago I was {{standing}} outside an office building in London Docklands around noon watching {{a group of people}} cooling down after a running session. I intepreted the situation as follows: this was a group of people {{in the middle of their}} carriers, working hard, commuting, having children to take care of after work and as a consequence trying to find a time slot for physical activity in the lunch hour. These thoughts ended up in one pilot study, one article and one extended project based on the following questions: 1. How, when and where do people in the age between 30 and 50 find time and space for physical activities? The selected group is likely to work and have children living at home. By physical activity is meant everything from walking <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bus stop <b>to</b> heavy, consciuos training. 2. How does the design of the work place and its suroundings effect the opportunities for activities in connection <b>to</b> <b>the</b> work day? My pilot study showed that the selected group find it hard to find room for physical activities in their daily programmes, and usually prefer flexible solutions like walking and running. Strategies (from what I – based on intensity and aims – call micro strategies to heavy training) in connection <b>to</b> or during <b>the</b> work day were common. Example of micro strategies is for instance using the stairs, while examples of more heavy training was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nearby <b>gym</b> during <b>the</b> lunch hour. Furthermore, I found examples of time deepening strategies, like taking a walk while supervising students. Another strategy was to use time slots that nobody else in the family claimed, like very early mornings. At the moment a more extensive material is analysed (including for instance 550 surveys) and will be ready <b>to</b> present at <b>the</b> conference...|$|R

40|$|Wacquant’s book {{focuses on}} the {{relationship}} bertween street culture {{and the world of}} <b>the</b> <b>gym.</b> Wacquant’s goal is <b>to</b> avoid <b>the</b> exotic insight often adopted in representing the environment of boxing, in order <b>to</b> focus on <b>the</b> <b>gym</b> space and on the daily life practices by a group of pugilists who are not probably <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be professionals. <b>The</b> <b>gym</b> turns into a a window allowing <b>to</b> observe <b>the</b> migratory flows towards U. S., since boxers belong mostly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> working class. The Author analyzes deeply the connection between pugilists and the coach, often similar to a father-son connection. The main issue of the book, however, is the teaching and learning dynamic through which they learn how <b>to</b> become pugilists. <b>The</b> training method of the “noble art”, indeed, shows the paradox of an individual discipline that implies a collective training. It’s impossible to learn boxing through a theoretical pathway. To learn a punch requests to repeat it thousands of times. Teaching a physical practices involves a lot of theoretical issues – this should be taken into careful consideration by social science when attempting to give a theoretical account of processes that happen mostly at an unconsciouos level. Il saggio di Loic Wacquant tratta di un gruppo di pugili immigrati, delle loro pratiche di vita e della palestra che frequentano quotidianamente in un ghetto nero di Chicago. E’ una riflessione sulla boxe e sulla sua funzione pedagogica...|$|R
