25|$|On 31 October the Japanese {{ministry}} of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology released a map showing the contamination of radioactive tellurium-129m within a 100-kilometer radius around the Fukushima No.1 nuclear plant. The map displayed the concentrations found of tellurium-129m – {{a byproduct of}} uranium fission – in the soil at 14 June 2011. High concentrations were discovered northwest of the plant and also at 28kilometers south near the coast, in the cities of Iwaki, Fukushima Prefecture, and Kitaibaraki, Ibaraki Prefecture. Iodine-131 was {{also found in the}} same areas, and most likely the tellurium was deposited {{at the same time as}} the iodine. The highest concentration found was 2.66million becquerels per square meter, two kilometers from the plant in the empty town of Okuma. Tellurium-129m has a half-life of 6days, so present levels are a very small fraction of the <b>initial</b> <b>contamination.</b> Tellurium has no biological functions, so even when drinks or food were contaminated with it, it would not accumulate in the body, like iodine in the thyroid gland.|$|E

40|$|A {{simulation}} {{study was}} carried out to assess whether variation in pasture contamination or stocking rate impact upon the optimal design of targeted selective treatment (TST) strategies. Two methods of TST implementation were considered: 1) treatment of a fixed percentage of a herd according to a given phenotypic trait, or 2) treatment of individuals that exceeded a threshold value for a given phenotypic trait. Four phenotypic traits, {{on which to base}} treatment were considered: 1) average daily bodyweight gain, 2) faecal egg count, 3) plasma pepsinogen, or 4) random selection. Each implementation method (fixed percentage or threshold treatment) and determinant criteria (phenotypic trait) was assessed in terms of benefit per R (BPR), the ratio of average benefit in weight gain to change in frequency of resistance alleles R (relative to an untreated population). The impact of pasture contamination on optimal TST strategy design was investigated by setting the <b>initial</b> pasture <b>contamination</b> to 100, 200 or 500 O. ostertagi L 3 /kg DM herbage; stocking rate was investigated at a low (3 calves/ha), conventional (5 calves/ha) or high (7 calves/ha) stocking rates. When treating a fixed percentage of the herd, treatments according to plasma pepsinogen or random selection were identified as the most beneficial (i. e. resulted in the greatest BPR) for all levels of <b>initial</b> pasture <b>contamination</b> and all stocking rates.

An innovative method to estimate residual stearic acid (C 18 H 36 O 2) after the atmospheric-pressure plasma cleaning process of a gold surface is presented. This method, based on surface potential measurement by a Kelvin probe, enables monitoring of treated samples. The Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) technique is used as a reference technique to specify with precision both initial and residual stearic acid masses.

40|$|This study {{presents}} the experimental remediation studies of diesel contaminated soil with Sodium Deducible Sulfate (SDS) as surfactants using column tests. Sandy selected soil had the {{grain size distribution}} of # 40 meshes to the # 200 mesh range. The soil columns were contaminated with adequate diesel amount to achieve the concentration of 10000 and 20000 ppm in soil. 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 3, 0. 4 percent of surfactants and pH values of 4, 7, 9 and 11, were examined. After 72 h, washing began and all tests were continued up to 10 pore volume and the trend of remediation and permeability of soil during the test was investigated. pH and TPH of outlet solution measured during 2, 4, 6 and 10 pore volumes. Times were recorded during 0. 67, 1, 1. 33, 2, 3. 33, 4, 5. 67, 6, 7. 33, 8, 8. 67, 9. 33 and 10 pore volumes, in order to calculate permeability values. Results showed that in all states the quantity of remediation for acidic states was very low and efficiency of remediation when using only water was about (1 : 3) of maximum amount. For soil with initial contaminant concentration of 10000 ppm the maximum efficiency is for surfactant in the concentration of 0. 3 and pH = 11 and for soil with <b>initial</b> <b>contamination</b> amount of 20000 ppm the maximum efficiency is for surfactant in the concentration of 0. 1 and pH = 11. By {{increasing the amount of}} surfactant concentration, the permeability of soil decreased and in pH = 11 the amount of permeability is maximum. With increasing <b>initial</b> <b>contamination</b> quantity rate of increasing of remediation and permeability decreased. Consequently in the low level of contamination the effect of washing solution pH value in soil remediation and permeability is more in comparing with high level of contamination. For <b>initial</b> <b>contamination</b> of 10000 ppm optimum removal efficiency obtained 35 % for surfactant of 0. 3 % and pH = 11. For <b>initial</b> <b>contamination</b> of 20000 ppm, optimum removal efficiency is obtained as 45 % for 0. 1 % of surfactant and pH = 11.

40|$|International audienceThe {{use of the}} Diffusive Gradient in Thin Film sampler (DGT) as a {{monitoring}} tool for regulatory programs is currently evaluated. In this context, the impact of commonly followed procedures on the accuracy of DGT-labile As, Cd, Cu, and Ni quantification was studied. <b>Initial</b> sampler <b>contamination</b> yields to define quantification limits instead of using blank subtraction, thus avoiding artifact concentrations. Not considering the alteration of element diffusion by the filter membrane leads to significant underestimation. However, diffusion coefficients determined on a non-fouled membrane {{were found to be}} suitable for the studied site, making it possible to use data from the literature. When diffusive boundary layer formation is neglected, no loss of accuracy is recorded provided the layer is thinner than 0. 5 mm.

Mothers {{of young children}} in Bangladesh rinsed both hands in 200 mL of ringer's solution. We compared results of serial samples with respect to fecal coliform counts. Among 39 mothers, the geometric mean of fecal coliforms was 307 colony-forming units (cfu) / 100 mL at initial collection and 3, 001 cfu/ 100 mL during critical times (P = 0. 0006). There was no correlation between initial and critical time fecal coliform counts (R = 0. 13, P = 0. 43). The mean difference between initial and critical time counts was 3. 5 (standard deviation = 1. 4) on the log base- 10 scale. Contamination of the same subjects' hands varied substantially within a few hours. Because hand contamination measured at random cannot reliably predict hand contamination at times of potential pathogen transmission, single random hand rinses are not valid proxy measures for handwashing behavior...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{accuracy}} of radioisotopic ages is, at present, {{limited by the}} {{accuracy of}} radioactive decay constants. A literature survey reveals that decay constants used in geo- and cosmochronology usually are assigned uncertainties of ca. 1 % but that there are very much larger unaccounted discrepancies between decay constants reported by different “counting groups ” as well as differences between results derived from counting experiments and from the comparison of ages obtained on the same samples by utilizing different radioactive clocks. An extension and partial revision of the decay constants recommended in 1976 for adoption in geo-and cosmochronology by the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) appears both desirable and feasible, given the analytical improvements of the last 20 years.

By systematically varying phosphorus diffusion gettering (PDG) parameters, we demonstrate {{a strong correlation between}} the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and the gettering efficiency. Similar correlation is also obtained for the short-circuit current (Jsc), but phosphorus dependency somewhat complicates the interpretation: the higher the phosphorus content not only the better the gettering efficiency but also the stronger the emitter recombination. With initial bulk iron concentration as high as 2 [*]×[*] 1014 [*]cm− 3, conversion efficiencies comparable with non-contaminated cells were obtained, which demonstrates the enormous potential of PDG. The results also clearly reveal the importance of well-designed PDG: to achieve best results, the gettering parameters used for high purity silicon should be chosen differently as compared with for a material with high impurity content. Finally we discuss the possibility of achieving efficient gettering without deteriorating the emitter performance by combining a selective emitter with a PDG treatment. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Background: There remains {{much debate}} {{on how to}} define an {{adequate}} sanitation protocol in hospital environments. Methods: The efficacy of a sanitation protocol {{in the operating room}} (OR) of a modern hospital was evaluated by measuring bacterial load on different types of finishing materials of all internal surfaces (ie, walls, floors, and furnishings). Samples were obtained before cleaning and over the subsequent 24 hours. A total of 2124 microbiological samples were collected using RODAC plates and sterile swabs. Results: The data demonstrate a very significant postsanitation reduction of bacterial load on floors and furnishings; however, no significant data on walls were obtained, because of the low levels of <b>initial</b> <b>contamination</b> (1. 50 to 5. 98 cfu/ 100 cm 2). The increase in postsanitation bacterial load over time was greater on smooth materials than on porous materials, on which a further reduction in contamination was seen. The study outcomes were confirmed by simulation experiments in which different materials were contaminated with a predetermined bacterial load and then subjected to the sanitation protocol. These simulation experiments were carried out both in vitro and in an eddy-flux testing room that simulated a full-scale OR similar (in terms of architectonic systems) to a real setting.

The effect of two muscle types (i. e. white-glycolytic (W) and red-oxidative (R)) and frozen storage (lasting 0, 30, 60 and 90 days) on quality characteristics were assessed. Significant differences were found between the W and R Iberian restructured preparations in most physicochemical and some colour, texture and sensory traits, and in the fatty acid profile and oxidative measurements, sug-gesting that the R muscles are more suitable; however, the microbial contamination should be reduced.
