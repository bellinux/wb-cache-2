40|$|The role of interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) in the {{pathogenesis}} of toxoplasmic encephalitis (TE) was examined by using IL- 6 -targeted mutant (IL- 6 (-/-)) mice. At 4 and 8 weeks after infection with the ME 49 strain of Toxoplasma gondii, significantly greater numbers of T. gondii cysts and areas of inflammation associated with tachyzoites were observed <b>in</b> <b>brains</b> of IL- 6 (-/-) mice than in those of control mice. Large areas of necrosis were observed only <b>in</b> <b>brains</b> of IL- 6 (-/-) mice. Tachyzoites were frequently detected {{in the areas of}} necrosis, suggesting that necrosis was caused by proliferation of the parasite. These results indicate that IL- 6 is protective against development of TE by preventing formation of T. gondii cysts and proliferation of tachyzoites <b>in</b> <b>brains</b> of infected mice. Whereas <b>in</b> <b>brains</b> of control mice, large numbers of inflammatory cells were always observed in areas where tachyzoites were detected, <b>in</b> <b>brains</b> of IL- 6 (-/-) mice, only small numbers of inflammatory cells were observed in many areas with tachyzoites. Lymphocyte preparations isolated from brains of infected control mice had significantly higher ratios of gamma/delta T cells and CD 4 + alpha/beta T cells but lower ratios of CD 8 + alpha/beta T cells compared to those of infected IL- 6 (-/-) mice. There were no differences in the ratios of these T-cell subsets in spleens between these mice. The amounts of mRNA for gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) detected by reverse transcriptase PCR were significantly smaller <b>in</b> <b>brains</b> of IL- 6 (-/-) mice than in those of control mice, whereas amounts of IL- 10 mRNA were greater in the former than in the latter. IL- 6 mRNA was detected only in infected control mice. The protective activity of IL- 6 against development of TE appears to be through its ability to stimulate IFN-gamma production and induce infiltration and accumulation of different T-cell subsets <b>in</b> <b>brains</b> of infected mice...|$|R

5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} also binds to the hemeprotein myoglobin. It {{has a high}} {{affinity for}} myoglobin, about 60 times {{greater than that of}} oxygen.

A delayed return of symptoms have been reported. This results following a recurrence of increased carboxyhemoglobin levels; this effect may be due to a late release of carbon monoxide from myoglobin, which subsequently binds to hemoglobin.|$|E

5|$|At a Nintendo {{press conference}} in Tokyo, Japan on October 5, 2005, the company {{announced}} several games {{that it would be}} releasing in 2006 in Japan. The list included Brain Age 2, with a release date set for December 29, 2005. Nintendo later announced that the game would be released in Europe on June 29, 2007 for €30, and in Australia on July 5, 2007 for A$49.95. The American version of Brain Age 2 was first revealed in May 2007. The game is targeted to casual gamers, similar to its predecessor; its basic concepts stay the same as in , along with the graphics, menu, and presentation. Brain Age 2 also uses the same Sudoku engine, an addition in the original Brain Age that has been applauded for being one of the best handheld Sudoku games available; Brain Age 2s rendition of Sudoku introduces 100 new puzzles. All of the minigames in the game are new to the series; however, some of them are derived from exercises <b>in</b> <b>Brain</b> Age. One of the challenges in the first game, Head Count, requires that the player count how many people are shown on the screen; after a few seconds, a house falls on top of them, and then several people leave and enter the house. Afterward, the player must write down how many people they think are still in the house. A variation of this game is available <b>in</b> <b>Brain</b> Age 2, called Memory Sprint, which asks the player to observe a specific sprinter in a race as they pass other sprinters and are passed themselves, and then determine which place they finished in after they cross the finish line. The game's voice recognition technology has improved since the last game. The only challenge that uses the feature, Rock, Paper, Scissors, requires that the player speak the correct answer into the microphone as soon as possible.|$|E

5|$|Fruit flies (Drosophila), {{because of}} the large array of {{techniques}} available for studying their genetics, have been a natural subject for studying the role of genes <b>in</b> <b>brain</b> development. In spite of the large evolutionary distance between insects and mammals, many aspects of Drosophila neurogenetics {{have been shown to be}} relevant to humans. The first biological clock genes, for example, were identified by examining Drosophila mutants that showed disrupted daily activity cycles. A search in the genomes of vertebrates revealed a set of analogous genes, which were found to play similar roles in the mouse biological clock—and therefore almost certainly in the human biological clock as well. Studies done on Drosophila, also show that most neuropil regions of the brain are continuously reorganized throughout life in response to specific living conditions.|$|E
5|$|Human {{language}} has {{the properties of}} productivity and displacement, and relies entirely on social convention and learning. Its complex structure affords a much wider range of expressions than any known system of animal communication. Language {{is thought to have}} originated when early hominins started gradually changing their primate communication systems, acquiring the ability to form a theory of other minds and a shared intentionality. This development is sometimes thought to have coincided with an increase <b>in</b> <b>brain</b> volume, and many linguists see the structures of language as having evolved to serve specific communicative and social functions. Language is processed in many different locations in the human brain, but especially in Broca's and Wernicke's areas. Humans acquire language through social interaction in early childhood, and children generally speak fluently when they are approximately three years old. The use of language is deeply entrenched in human culture. Therefore, in addition to its strictly communicative uses, language also has many social and cultural uses, such as signifying group identity, social stratification, as well as social grooming and entertainment.|$|E
5|$|Putnam himself {{may be his}} own most {{formidable}} philosophical adversary. His frequent changes of mind have led him to attack his previous positions. However, many significant criticisms of his views have come from other philosophers and scientists. For example, multiple realizability has been criticized on the grounds that, if it were true, research and experimentation in the neurosciences would be impossible. According to William Bechtel and Jennifer Mundale, {{to be able to}} conduct such research in the neurosciences, universal consistencies must either exist or be assumed to exist <b>in</b> <b>brain</b> structures. It is the similarity (or homology) of brain structures that allows us to generalize across species. If multiple realizability were an empirical fact, results from experiments conducted on one species of animal (or one organism) would not be meaningful when generalized to explain the behavior of another species (or organism of the same species). Other criticisms of metaphysical realism have been proposed by Jaegwon Kim, David Lewis, Robert Richardson and Patricia Churchland.|$|E
