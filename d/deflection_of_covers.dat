In fabrication <b>of</b> the fragile <b>cover,</b> a particular hand lay-up molding process is proposed. The deflection and failure pressure of the circular composite fragile cover have been experimentally investigated. The {{results show that the}} <b>deflections</b> <b>of</b> <b>cover</b> center will grow nonlinearly along with the increasing gas pressure and have less distinction with different height of weak zone. The failure pressure <b>of</b> the <b>cover</b> first increases and then decreases with the increasing height of the weak zone, which obtains the maximum value of 0. 79 MPa at the weak zone height of 18 mm...|$|R
40|$|Deflections {{and strains}} in an ice <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> a frozen channel {{caused by an}} {{underwater}} body moving under the ice with a constant speed along the channel are studied. The channel is of rectangular cross section, the fluid in the channel is inviscid and incompressible. The ice cover is clamped to the channel walls. The ice cover is modeled by a thin viscoelastic plate. The underwater body is modeled by a three-dimensional dipole. The intensity of the dipole {{is related to the}} speed and size of the underwater body. The problem is considered within the linear theory of hydroelasticity. For small <b>deflections</b> <b>of</b> the ice <b>cover</b> the velocity potential of the dipole in the channel is obtained by the method of images in leading order without account for the <b>deflection</b> <b>of</b> the ice <b>cover.</b> The problem <b>of</b> moving dipole in the channel with rigid walls provides the hydrodynamic pressure on the upper boundary of the channel, which corresponds to the ice cover. This pressure distribution does not depend on the <b>deflection</b> <b>of</b> the ice <b>cover</b> in the leading approximation. The <b>deflections</b> <b>of</b> the ice and strains in the ice plate are independent of time in the coordinate system moving together with the dipole. The problem is solved numerically using the Fourier transform, method of the normal modes and the truncation method for infinite systems of algebraic equations...|$|R
40|$|In Francis turbine, a small {{clearance}} {{gap between the}} guide vanes and the cover plates is usually required to pivot guide vanes as a part <b>of</b> governing system. <b>Deflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>cover</b> plates and erosion of mating surfaces causes this gap to increase from its design value. The clearance gap induces the secondary flow in the distributor system. This effects the main flow at the runner inlet, which causes losses in efficiency and instability. A guide vane cascade of a low specific speed Francis turbine has been developed for experimental investigations. The test setup is able to produce similar velocity distributions at the runner inlet {{as that of a}} reference prototype turbine. The setup is designed for particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements from the position of stay vane outlet to the position of runner inlet. In this study, velocity and pressure measurements are conducted with 2 mm clearance gap on one side of guide vane. Leakage flow is observed and measured together with pressure measurements. It is concluded that the leakage flow behaves as a jet and mixes with the main flow in cross-wise direction and forms a vortex filament. This causes non-uniform inlet flow conditions at runner blades...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} a multi-domain simulation of a gerotor oil pump. Three different analysis tools {{have been used}} in synergy to predict the pump flow rate, in both conditions of complete and incomplete filling, and the pressure ripple. The computational fluid dynamics software PumpLinx® has been used for the determination of the discharge coefficients, while a finite element model analysis performed with ANSYS® has allowed the evaluation <b>of</b> the <b>deflection</b> <b>of</b> the pump <b>cover</b> under the action of the delivery pressure. The data calculated with the 3 D tools have been utilized as input for a lumped parameter model of the pump developed in LMS Amesim® with customized libraries. The aim of the study is to supply the guidelines for tuning the models using a reduced number of computational fluid dynamics simulations. The results collected in the experimental campaign have demonstrated that a lumped parameter approach can be suitable, if properly calibrated, to predict the pressure oscillations in conditions of defective filling. Moreover, {{it was found that the}} cover deflection has a significant importance not only on the leakages, but also on the pressure ripple...|$|R

Studies have shown that before the sliping of 4 # CFRP sling, the <b>deflection</b> growth <b>of</b> east and west tie-beam, east and west arch both has good symmetry. The <b>deflection</b> growth <b>of</b> crossbeams and decks also has good symmetry, but after the sliping of 4 # CFRP sling(located at the middle of west tie-beam), the structural internal forces redistribution appeared. The <b>deflection</b> <b>of</b> west tie-beam increased suddenly, and the mid-span <b>deflection</b> <b>of</b> west tie-beam is larger than that of east tie-beam by 14. 6 %. The mid-span <b>deflection</b> <b>of</b> east arch is larger than that of west arch by 9. 9 %. The <b>deflection</b> <b>of</b> crossbeam at 3 L/ 8 and L/ 4 sections are respectively larger than those of crossbeam at 5 L/ 8 and 3 L/ 4 sections by 13. 8 % and 5. 3 %, The <b>deflection</b> <b>of</b> 3 #, 2 # and 1 # decks are respectively larger than those of 4 #, 5 # and 6 # decks by 7. 8 %, 13. 2 % and 17. 1 %.

In this paper, two-dimensional finite-element modeling is conducted to investigate the total <b>deflection</b> <b>of</b> buried high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipes with a special consideration of the peaking behavior. The finite-element modeling method is evaluated using the data measured in a field trial which is presented in Part I. Parametric study are conducted.

Based on analyses of the finite-element simulation results and experimental data, two empirical formulas with five parameters are proposed to describe the total <b>deflection</b> <b>of</b> HDPE pipes in both the vertical and horizontal directions. A comprehensive comparison is made between the calculated deflections made using the proposed equations and some existing methods and the measured data from published papers.

The characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>deflection</b> <b>of</b> main beams display as the long-term growth; the growth rate may be accelerating, reducing and keeping the trend of uniform change. Thus, the structural long-term deflection is far larger to the value of design calculation. There are many bridges of this problem, and now let us list some, as follows...|$|R
