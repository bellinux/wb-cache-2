40|$|ABSTRACT- Comfort is an {{attribute}} that today’s drivers demand more and more. Seat {{is one of}} the important features of vehicle and there is the place where the professional driver spends most of their time. According to ‘European Union Legislation for Drivers and Promote’, the weekly driving time for truck <b>drivers</b> <b>shall</b> not exceed 56 hours. Assuming eight week vacation and one more for holiday, the truck driver is spending around 2408 hours driving time per year. Truck seat, which are in contact with truck occupants, {{play an important role in}} improving the comfort and work environment of a driver. The perceived comfort of humans in a given environment can be classified as a subjective assessment, because it is possible to find a considerable variation in responses of different people to the same situation. Nevertheless, the factors on which the opinions of people on (dis) comfort level are physical variables such as pressure, temperature and heart rate. The main research objective is to investigate “How to improve the truck seat comfort objectively? ” The paper describes the state-of-the-art objective measurement techniques in seat development and an intelligent system is proposed for the next generation truck driver’s seat...|$|E

40|$|The {{superintendent}} or designee shall develop written rules {{establishing the}} procedures for bus safety and emergency exit drills and for student conduct while riding on buses. The bus driver {{is responsible for}} the safety of his/her passengers, particularly for those who cross a roadway after leaving the bus. No bus <b>driver</b> <b>shall</b> order or allow a student to disembark at other than his/her customary boarding or alighting place unless so authorized by the superintendent. In order to assure the safety of all, the bus driver and/or district administrator may hold students accountable for their conduct during the course of transportation and may recommend corrective action against a student. Bus drivers are expressly prohibited from using corporal punishment. In the event of an accident or other emergency, the bus <b>driver</b> <b>shall</b> follow the emergency procedures developed by the superintendent/designee. A copy of the emergency procedures shall be located in each bus. To ensure the success of such emergency procedures, each bus <b>driver</b> <b>shall</b> conduct an emergency evacuation drill within the first six weeks of each school semester.

Each bus <b>driver</b> <b>shall</b> meet the qualifications established by the State Board of Education and Superintendent of Public Instruction, including possession of any required certifications, valid and current Washington State driver’s license together with any required endorsements, and physician’s certifications for employment as a bus driver. The bus <b>driver</b> <b>shall</b> also hold a valid and current first aid card indicating completion of at least a basic first aid course within the past three years. When a teacher, coach, or other certificated staff member is assigned to accompany students on a bus, said person shall be primarily responsible for the behavior of the students in his/her charge. The bus <b>driver</b> <b>shall</b> have final authority and responsibility. When the district utilizes charter buses or excursion carriers, the <b>driver</b> <b>shall</b> not have unsupervised access to children and the children shall be supervised by a responsible employee of the district. Every contract between a school district and charter bus or excursion carrier shall contain a carrier profile from the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission.

2500|$|Countries {{party to}} the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic have uniform rules about {{overtaking}} and lane designation.

Allowed exceptions to these rules include turning or heavy traffic, traffic in lines, or situation in which signs or markings must dictate otherwise. These rules must be more strictly adhered to on roads with oncoming traffic, but still apply on multi-lane and divided highways. Many countries in Europe are {{party to the}} Vienna Conventions on traffic and roads.

Rosberg spoke of [...] "an exciting race" [...] against Verstappen and highlighted his [...] "very critical problem" [...] with his gearbox, but stressed that he felt confident that the instructions he received from his team to fix it were within the rules. However, the stewards – led by former driver Nigel Mansell – did not share his view and applied a ten-second time penalty for what they felt were instructions not compliant with the sporting regulations, demoting Rosberg to third place. The rules on instructions from the team to the driver had been tightened before the first race of the season, specifying that [...] "the <b>driver</b> <b>shall</b> drive the car alone and unaided".|$|R

Lower labor costs are the primary driver, but companies also {{want to focus on}} their core businesses and create value for their shareholders. Recently, companies even move beyond non-strategic functions into important operational and strategic functions. Smart companies have gained strategic advantage by offshoring processes. Many risks involve in offshore outsourcing of professional services because on behalf of client organization service provider provides services. Political instability in offshore destinations is one of the risks related to offshore outsourcing. Political risks are very volatile and also often more difficult to observe, so they may go unnoticed. Terrorism, Fiscal & Monetary policies, and Corruption are obvious problems that complicate offshore process management. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} identify and understand the mutual interaction among various drivers of political risk which affects the performance of offshore outsourcing. To this effect, authors have identified various drivers through extant review of literature.
