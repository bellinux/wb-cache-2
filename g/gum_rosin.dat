50|$|There {{are three}} types of rosin: <b>gum</b> <b>rosin</b> (from pine tree oleoresin), wood rosin (obtained by {{extraction}} of tree stumps), and tall oil rosin (obtained from tall oil, a byproduct of kraft paper process). <b>Gum</b> <b>rosin</b> has a milder odor and lower tendency to crystallize from solutions than wood rosin, and is therefore preferred for flux applications. Tall oil rosin finds increased use due to its higher thermal stability and therefore lower tendency to form insoluble thermal decomposition residues. The composition and quality of rosin differs by the tree type, and also by location and even by year. In Europe, rosin for fluxes is usually obtained from {{a specific type of}} Portuguese pine, in America a North Carolina variant is used.|$|E

40|$|Turpentine oils, <b>gum</b> oleoresins and <b>rosins</b> from Pinus merkusii Jungh et de Vrises were {{collected}} {{on the island of}} Sumatra and Java for investigation of their chemical composition. Gum oleoresins were separated into neutral and acidic fractions with an aqueous 4 % sodium hydroxide solution. The fractions containing turpentine oils and rosins were analyzed by Gas Chromatography (GC) and Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), respectively. The neutral fractions of gum oleoresins and turpentine oils mainly consisted of α-pinene, Δ- 3 -carene and β-pinene. A difference in chemical composition with locality was recognized for the turpentine oils and neutral fractions of gum oleoresins. While examining the chemical composition of the acidic fractions of <b>gum</b> oleoresins and <b>rosins,</b> we found that relative retention time could not be used to identify each resin acid. Based on mass spectral comparison, the major constituents of the acidic fractions and rosins were identified as sandaracopimaric acid, isopimaric acid, palustric acid, dehydroabietic acid, abietic acid, neoabietic acid and merkusic acid. The major component of the acidic fractions was palustric acid, while that of both rosin 1 and 2 was abietic acid. The chemical composition of the acidic fractions of <b>gum</b> oleoresins and <b>rosins</b> differed with locality. Using TC- 1 and TC- 5 columns, levopimaric acid could not be separated from rosins or acidic fractions of gum oleoresins of Indonesian Pinus merkusii.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to analyze the Gum Rosin's competitive advantages from the industry, enterprises and country of China, Brazil and Indonesia, to formulate the strategy of Indonesia's business development based on the competitiveness model of <b>Gum</b> <b>Rosin</b> International Market. The study is not only about comparing the Pine forest as a natural resource and measuring its productivity per hectare, but also observing the productivity and efficiency of the workers in each country. The analysis of industrial competitiveness is measured by using RCA#, and the production cost and profit margin ratio is used to measure competitiveness among the enterprises. It can be concluded that China has the largest area of sap-tapped pine forest and Brazil is the highest for its forest productivity and workers' efficiency, however Indonesia has the highest Profit Margin among the other countries. In term of the value of RCA# during the year of observation 2001 up to 2008, China exceeded Indonesia and Brazil. The trend of <b>Gum</b> <b>Rosin</b> production of China and Brazil tends to increase, meanwhile the export tends to decrease. On the other hands, Indonesia's production tends to decrease however the export tends to increase.

In the 1900s in Canada, resins from local trees were used to finish pianos. As a result, these now antique pianos are considered difficult to refinish. However, shellac can be used over the existing resins provided sufficient time is allowed for thin coats to cure. Thus the original finish can be returned to its original lustre while preserving the color and age-related crackle.|$|R

This research has been expected to be able to reduce the water pollution along with the decline in the quantity of batik solid waste which has been discharged into water bodies. However, research needs to be done regarding the quality of batik product resulting from a production process using wax which involves the use of batik wax waste. The batik product quality is determined by latched power, and the resistance of the wax against cracking and alkaline chemicals of batik wax product which has been used. The latched power test results from four groups of batik wax product showed the area with minimum latched power on temperature range of 50 - 70 ˚C for batik wax which have been made from blending of bees wax, wax waste, and <b>gum</b> <b>rosin,</b> 50 - 80 ˚C for batik wax which have been made from blending of bees wax, wax waste, and paraffin;  50 - 90 ˚C for batik wax which have been made from blending of bees wax, <b>gum</b> <b>rosin</b> and lard.

40|$|AbstractIn {{biodegradable}} polymer nanocomposite, {{the important}} factors {{to determine its}} properties are polymer, biodegradable materials and nano filler. In case of nano filler of organo layer silicate (OLS) the interlayer gallery also plays an important role. This research is intended to study the effect of surfactants to the interlayer of OLS by sonication. Glycerol monostearate (GMS) and <b>gum</b> <b>rosin</b> (GR) were used to increase the OLS gallery or intercalation and the temperature stability as it provides an advantage for OLS to ease the exfoliation process. The relationship between OLS and surfactant was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) to observe the dispersion of silicate and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) to identify the effect of surfactants. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out {{to prove that the}} previous surfactant is already substituted. It was found that pretreatment of OLS with sonication using GMS and GR improved the interlayer gallery, and the improvement is getting higher with the increasing of concentration.

40|$|Realistic {{lava flow}} models require a {{comprehensive}} {{understanding of the}} rheological properties of lava under a range of stress conditions. Previous measurements have shown that at typical eruption temperatures lavas are non-Newtonian. This is commonly attributed to the formation and destruction of crystal networks. In the present study, the effects of bubbles on the time-dependent, non-Newtonian properties of vesicular melts are investigated experimentally using analogue materials. The shear-thinning behaviour of bubbly liquids is shown {{to be dependent on}} the previous shearing history. This thixotropic behaviour, which was investigated using a rotational vane-viscometer, is caused by delayed bubble deformation and recovery when subjected to changes in shear stress. The viscoelastic transition and the transient flow behaviour of analogue fluids were studied using both a rotational vane-viscometer and oscillatory shear apparatus. These experiments have shown that vesicular suspensions are viscoelastic fluids with a yield strength, power law rheology, and a non-zero shear modulus. These properties are also found in polymer fluids commonly used as analogue materials for lava such as <b>gum</b> <b>rosin.</b> We show that, when materials with this rheology are accelerated in channels, they may be fragmented, and when they flow through a narrowing conduit, pulsating flow can develop as a consequence of a transition from slip to non-slip conditions at the conduit wall. This has important implications both for effusive and explosive volcanic eruptions...|$|E
40|$|The work {{contains}} {{studies of}} the chemical composition of adducts {{on the basis of}} terpenoids and maleic anhydride to provide controlled synthesis {{on the basis of their}} secondary products with specified performance characteristics. The determination of the qualitative and quantitative composition of the mixtures of resin acids of pine turpentine and rosin by their methyl esters was performed with GLC analysis; the components of pine resin, rosin, turpentine, adducts was performed with NMR spectroscopy, functional groups in the original terpenoid resins and products of their interaction with oxygen-containing compounds (maleopimaric acid) and terpenoidmaleic adducts by the method of IR spectroscopy. Good convergence of the results obtained by NMR spectroscopy and GLC analysis on the composition of pine resin, <b>gum</b> <b>rosin</b> and turpentine confirms their authenticity. Using the obtained experimental and calculated data the composition of terpenoidmaleic adducts wasset. When obtaining resin terpenoidmaleic adducts, the composition of turpentine solution of resin varied in the range from 30 / 70 to 70 / 30 wt %, the calculated amount of maleic anhydride to link all resin acids with conjugated double bonds and terpene hydrocarbons varied from 57. 7 to 38. 3 wt %. It is shown that when modification of turpentine composition from 30 / 70 to 70 / 30 wt % with maleic anhydride increases, there is a significant change in the compositions of obtained terpenoidmaleic adducts of rosin. When comparing experimental data and theoretical calculations regularity is established in the change of composition of terpenoidmaleic of rosin adducts obtained from various terpentine: content of maleopimaric acid naturally increases with the increase of resin acids and the content of terpenoidmaleic adducts decreases. It is shown th at terpinoidmaleic adducts are multicomponent sys-tems composed of maleopimaric acid, terpinolene ad ducts, and of resin acids, which do not react with maleic anhydride. By varying the composition of the turpentine and the amount of maleic anhydride, adducts with different content components can be obtained, and hence, regulating their specifications. The efficiency of using the methods of NMR and IR spectroscopy to study the composition terpenoidmaleic adducts is demonstrated...|$|E
