5000|$|The AI {{rules of}} the <b>Dipmeter</b> <b>Advisor</b> were {{primarily}} derived from Al Gilreath, a Schlumberger interpretation engineer who developed the [...] "red, green, blue" [...] pattern method of dipmeter interpretation.Unfortunately this method had limited application in more complex geological environments outside the Gulf Coast, and the <b>Dipmeter</b> <b>Advisor</b> was primarily used within Schlumberger as a graphical display tool to assist interpretation by trained geoscientists, {{rather than as an}} AI tool for use by novice interpreters. However, the tool pioneered a new approach to workstation-assisted graphical interpretation of geological information.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Dipmeter</b> <b>Advisor</b> was {{an early}} expert system {{developed}} in the 1980s by Schlumberger {{with the help of}} artificial-intelligence workers at MIT to aid in the analysis of data gathered during oil exploration. The Advisor was generally not merely an inference engine and a knowledge base of ~90 rules, but generally was a full-fledged workstation, running on one of Xerox's 1100 Dolphin Lisp machines (or in general on Xerox's [...] "1100 Series Scientific Information Processors" [...] line) and written in INTERLISP-D, with a pattern recognition layer which in turn fed a GUI menu-driven interface. It was developed by a number of people, including Reid G. Smith, James D. Baker, and Robert L. Young.|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{frameworks for}} studying expertise at the knowledge level and knowledge-use level. It reviews existing approaches such as inference structures, {{the distinction between}} deep and surface knowledge, problem-solving methods, and generic tasks. A new synthesis is put forward {{in the form of}} a componential framework that stresses modularity and an analysis of the pragmatic constraints on the task. The analysis of a rule from an existing expert system (the <b>Dipmeter</b> <b>Advisor)</b> is used to illustrate the framework. This work was supported in part by the Belgian IWONL Program on Expert Systems. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|We discuss {{commercial}} {{expert system}} development, using our {{experience with the}} <b>Dipmeter</b> <b>Advisor</b> system as a case study. While the data is too sparse for definitive results, several ideas have emerged as important and suggestive as guidelines for subsequent commercial expert system undertakings. During the past four years, the <b>Dipmeter</b> <b>Advisor</b> system has migrated from an initial experiment in application of expert system techniques in well-log interpretation to a candidate commercial interpretation system. The system has undergone substantial change: It has been implemented in different configurations, in different languages, and on different computer systems. Our ability to experiment with the system has been greatly enhanced by the tools and ideas of rapid prototyping. We have also observed an oscillation in thrust over time between (i) expansion and change in the domain knowledge, and 00 selection and design of appropriate expert system tools. Finally, we have found several of the maxims of expert system development to be valid, but question a number of others. 2. THE PROBLEM Oil-well logs are made by lowering tools into the borehole and recording measurements made by the tools as they are raised to the surface. The resulting logs are sequences of values indexed by depth. Logging tools measure a variety of petrophysical properties. The dipmeter tool in particular measures the conductivity of rock {{in a number of}} directions around the borehole. Variations in conductivity can be correlated and combined with measurements of the inclination and orientation of the tool to estimate the magnitude and azimuth of the dip or tilt of various formation layers penetrated by the borehole (Figure 1.).

30|$|There is {{also often}} a {{significant}} amount of effort placed in engineering the knowledge structure in expert systems so that reasoning can occur to handle unforeseen situations. While KEF does attempt to annotate semantic relationships identified within the data sources, these are not hard-coded ontologies â€“ rather, we build up a categorization scheme based on the content identified [10]. Finally, typical expert systems focus on a very narrowly defined domain such as Mycin [12] and CADUCEUS [13] (both medical diagnosis systems), NeteXPERT [14] (network operations automation system), KnowledgeBench [15] (new product development applications), and <b>Dipmeter</b> <b>Advisor</b> [16] (oil exploration system). KEF, while similar in many regards to these other examples, is distinctly different as it is specifically designed to be widely applicable to many domains allowing for customization to meet specific domain needs and requirements.|$|E
