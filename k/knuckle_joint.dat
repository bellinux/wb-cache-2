40|$|The article {{raises an}} issue to enhance {{technological}} forging capabilities on the known <b>knuckle</b> <b>joint</b> presses. It provides an illustrated overview of main design types of presses with crank-knuckle, toggle-knuckle, and <b>knuckle</b> <b>joint</b> mechanisms. The article also shows {{the advantages of}} the modernization way and improvement just of the active press equipment in terms of quality-to-price ratio, for example, as compared to the similar new foreign press equipment. It gives an overview of features, which provide forging processes owing to kinetic energy accumulated with the moving parts of the known designs of the <b>knuckle</b> <b>joint</b> presses depending on the drive actuating mechanism. Focused attention is drawn to forging on the <b>knuckle</b> <b>joint</b> presses for a time of contact with a work piece to be comparable with the duration of the work piece deformation process on hydraulic forging hammers. This allows us to forge thin-wall products with process automation compared to the forging hammers. Analysis of accumulating processes of kinetic energy by the moving parts of the <b>knuckle</b> <b>joint</b> presses has shown that presses driven by hydraulic cylinders or two screw hydraulic cylinder are the most optimal for technological operations as evidenced by references to domestic and foreign invention certificates and patents. The article presents disadvantages of forging on presses with hydraulic or pneumatic drive. It is a dependence of the deformation force, caused, mainly, by a force of the drive cylinder. The article gives linear movement rate quantities of press moving members depending on the drives of the actuating mechanism. Based on the above analysis of the features to manufacture work pieces on the <b>knuckle</b> <b>joint</b> presses, the article gives the rationale for the relevance of forging {{in a short period of}} time, provided that the moving parts of the press accumulate the required kinetic energy. This can be achieved only through modernization and improvement of forging equipment designs, in particular, using modern industrial hydraulics facilities, software and hardware systems for industrial automation. </p...|$|E

50|$|Soon after {{entering}} service, problems were experienced with failing connecting rods, big end bearings breaking {{up as well}} as cracks developing in the motion girder of the Alligator crossheads. After investigations by SAR engineers with assistance from the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), the crossheads, slide bars and coupling rods were modified.

50|$|Doing fist pushups on the {{backside}} of the first fingerbone would increasingly {{put pressure on the}} extensor muscles as weight was shifted from knuckle-end to the further joint. When in a tight first, the flat of the fingernails can dig into the palm and push the skin down to create a bridge to stabilize the first structure and prevent hyperflexion of the <b>knuckle</b> <b>joints</b> (which can be observed by doing pushups with the entire backside of the fingers flat on the ground, fingers pointing towards the opposite hand).|$|R
50|$|To {{enable them}} to {{negotiate}} 300 ft radius curves, the leading coupled wheels were given a 1 in total side-play in their horn blocks, while the tyre flanges of the intermediate coupled wheels were of reduced thickness and the leading coupling rods were provided with spherical bearings at the <b>knuckle</b> <b>joints</b> and crank pins. In addition, largely also {{as a result of}} the decision to use the shorter Watson Standard boiler, it was decided to reduce the coupled wheel diameter from the originally intended 66 in to 63 in, which shortened the coupled wheelbase and would further ease passage on sharp curves.|$|R
40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of {{technology}} in recent decades {{has led to the}} reduction of cost and weight of materials. The modified system has become popular in industry as well as in research. As a result, this there are reduction in accident and safety has increased. Many systems used in industries use <b>knuckle</b> <b>joint</b> which is combination of two materials: cast iron and stainless steel. Here we are proposing the modification of one of the material that is changing cast iron into a composite polymer material. The proposed system has many advantages over other system such as making the device, simpler and having maximum safety and is ecofriendly. The analysis of the system proves all the above features mention above. The reason for considering polymer is that property of polymer is mostly similar to the property of metal. Composite polymers are characterized by a high flexibility material. The revolutionary evolution in technologies in last year allowed reducing stress and strain. In the present work ANSYS 13 has been used for analysis of <b>knuckle</b> <b>joint</b> with modified material and varying loads...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} is to make it easy for engineers to predict the dynamics of the knucklejoint press. These predictions are essential for the optimal design of its mechanical system. At firs, we developed a computer aided design system for the analysis introducing dynamic simulation software named Working Model. In this system, Working Model is linked to other applications such as CAD and Excel in order to make it easy to draw a diagram of the analytical model and to analyze data generated by simulations. Then we performed the experiments of the knucklejoint press, and compared the experimental results with the simulation results to verify　that this simulation results show accurately the dynamic characteristics of the actual machine. Finally we investigated the fluctuation in rotating speed and the effect of flywheel...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} realize fast OCT-systems with {{adjustable}} line rate, we investigate averaging of image data from an FDML based MHz-OCT-system.

30|$|There {{are a few}} {{works on}} finger knuckle {{recognition}} using MCP and DIP joints compared with PIP joints. Kumar [25] has proposed a finger knuckle recognition algorithm using both major and first minor finger knuckle patterns, i.e., PIP and DIP joints. Combination of two joint patterns improved performance of finger knuckle recognition. Kumar et al. [2] have also considered the use of texture patterns around MCP joints to identify persons. Both works gave us the fundamental investigation of biometric recognition using minor finger <b>knuckle</b> <b>joints,</b> since the performance has been evaluated using images of a hand with the fingers and thumb spread apart put on a flat plane.|$|R

40|$|Background: Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) {{arthroplasty}} with implants, {{which is}} the replacement of painful <b>knuckle</b> <b>joints</b> with artificial <b>knuckle</b> <b>joints,</b> has been performed for people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) since the 1960 s. The surgery is done because RA can cause damage of the <b>knuckle</b> <b>joints</b> making them unable to straighten out (flexion deformity) and causing them to lean over toward the small finger (flexion or ulnar deviation deformity). For eight to 12 weeks following surgery, patients wear hand splints and perform exercises to maintain and increase motion in the healing hand. Post-operative therapy regimes share common aims of encouraging MCP flexion and extension without the recurrence of flexion or ulnar deviation deformity. Objectives: To compare the effectiveness of post-operative therapy regimes for increasing hand function after MCP arthroplasty in adults with rheumatoid arthritis. Search strategy: The Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group Register, MEDLINE (January 1950 to August 2006), EMBASE (January 1993 to August 2006), CINAHL (January 1982 to August 2006), Digital Dissertations (January 1960 to August 2006), DARE (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 3), Current Contents Connect (January 1998 to August 2006), and AMED (January 1985 to August 2006) were searched for randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials using rheumatoid arthritis and hand as the search terms. The bibliographies of all trials identified by this strategy were also searched and primary authors were contacted for unpublished data and also clarification regarding study protocols. We performed handsearches of all relevant society conference proceedings and reference lists of retrieved articles. No language limits were applied, although searches were only relevant after the 1950 s when MCP arthroplasty began to be performed. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials were accepted if they evaluated the efficacy of a post-operative therapy regime for MCP arthroplasty. Data collection and analysis: No data analyses were performed as only one controlled clinical trial was found. The data from that study are described. Main results: Our search only identified one controlled clinical trial involving 22 participants. The majority of the evidence for various splinting and exercise regimes consisted of case series and case studies. Results from the one (poor quality) trial suggest {{that the use of}} continuous passive motion is not effective in increasing motion or strength after MCP arthroplasty. Authors' conclusions: Well-designed randomised controlled trials which compare the efficacy of different therapeutic splinting programmes following MCP arthroplasty are required. At this time, the results of one study (silver level evidence) suggest that continuous passive motion alone is not recommended for increasing motion or strength after MCP arthroplasty.
