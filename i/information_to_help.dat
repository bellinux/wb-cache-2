5|$|Chrono Trigger {{takes place}} in a world {{familiar}} to Earth, with eras such as the prehistoric age, in which primitive humans and dinosaurs share the earth; the Middle Ages, replete with knights, monsters, and magic; and the post-apocalyptic future, where destitute humans and sentient robots struggle to survive. The characters frequently travel through time to obtain allies, gather equipment, and learn <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> them in their quest. The party also gains access to the End of Time (represented as year ∞), which serves as a hub to travel back to other time periods. The party eventually acquires a time-machine vehicle known as the Wings of Time, nicknamed the Epoch. The vehicle is capable of time travel between any time period without first having to travel to the End of Time.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the {{investigations}} of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, Doggett stumbles upon a case that may hold {{a connection to the}} murder of his son. With the help of an FBI cadet named Rudolph Hayes (Jared Poe), Doggett acquires <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> his current case as well as establish the link between the present, his Jane Does, and the past—his son, Luke. The link is a man named Nicholas Regali, an organized crime participant who has an association with Bob Harvey, the only suspect in Luke's case. Though the cadet, Hayes, is not who he says he is, his information proves invaluable in Doggett's search for release from his son's death.|$|E

25|$|Following this battle, a US peace {{commission}} {{toured the}} Plains in 1867 to gather <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> bring about peace among the tribes {{and with the}} US. Finding that the Native Americans had been provoked by white encroachment and competition for resources, the commission recommended assigning definite territories to the Plains tribes. The Lakota, Northern Cheyenne, Arapaho, and other bands settled for peace with the US under the Treaty of Fort Laramie. The US agreed to abandon its forts and withdraw completely from Lakota territory.|$|E

25|$|Public shock {{following}} the incident resulted in reassessment of the government's Indian policy, and a U.S. Peace Commission toured the Great Plains in 1867 to gather <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> bring about peace among the tribes {{and with the}} U.S. The Commission concluded Native Americans had been provoked by white encroachment and competition for resources and recommended assigning definite territories to the Great Plains tribes.

25|$|Aside from {{questions}} concerning their ethical values and conduct, {{many have been}} accredited for giving {{back to the community}} in several ways. Just before the Joplin tornado a storm chaser provided advanced warning to local law enforcement, prompting them to activate the emergency sirens. Though lives were lost, many who survived accredited their survival to the siren. After a storm has passed storm chasers are often the first to arrive on the scene to help assist in the aftermath. An unexpected and yet increasingly more common result of storm chasers is the data they provide to storm research from their videos, social video posts and documentation of storms they encounter. After the El Reno tornado in 2013 portals were created for chasers to submit their <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> in the research of the deadly storm.|$|E

25|$|On January 30th, TEPCO {{inserted}} a camera into the unit 2 containment system {{to investigate the}} region underneath the reactor vessel. TEPCO was able to estimate radiation levels of 530 Sv/hr, the highest level measured since the March 2011 accident when the previous high was measured at 73 Sv/hr. This doesn't represent an increase in radiation, however {{is the first time}} measurements in the containment were taken at this location. This investigation provided visual evidence that the core melt partially breached the reactor vessel.A 1x1 meter hole in the grating of the undervessel Control Rod Drive inspection platform was identified along with various deposits of core debris and sediment.TEPCO is using this <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> plan an upcoming robot entry to the under-vessel region of the concrete-floored containment.

25|$|In 1796, Edward Jenner, {{a doctor}} and {{scientist}} who had practiced variolation, performed an experiment based on the folk-knowledge that infection with cowpox, a disease with minor symptoms which was never fatal, also conferred immunity to smallpox. The idea was not new; it had been demonstrated some years earlier by Benjamin Jesty, who had not publicized his discovery. In 1798, Jenner extended his observations by showing that cowpox could be passed from a lesion on one patient to others through four arm to arm transfers and that the last in the series was immune by exposing him to smallpox. Jenner described the procedure, distributed his vaccine freely, and provided <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> those hoping to establish their own vaccines. In 1798 he published his information in his famous Inquiry into the Causes and Effects...of the Cow Pox. He is credited with being the first to start detailed investigations of the subject and of bringing it {{to the attention of}} the medical profession. Despite some opposition vaccination took over from variolation.|$|E
25|$|As the {{deadline}} nears, the LBA executives begin to panic and lash out, {{resulting in a}} contradictory sequence where Wolfe is fired and then rehired within a span of minutes. When all seems lost, however, an anonymous source sends copies of the answers {{to each of the}} contestants, thus voiding the contest and saving LBA. Although Archie, the LBA executives and the police suspect Wolfe of doing so, he insists that he was not responsible, and begins to suspect one of the advertising executives of at least stealing the wallet, if not murdering Dahlmann. After the letters are sent, Vernon Assa approaches Wolfe and attempts to unilaterally dismiss him from the case, but Wolfe refuses. His suspicions aroused, Wolfe summons the major players to his office and claims he will reveal the identity of the thief, and in doing so provide the police with vital <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> them identify the murderer. Before he can do so, however, Vernon Assa is poisoned with cyanide surreptitiously slipped into his drink and dies on the floor of Wolfe's office. Dahlmann's wallet is found in his pocket, suggesting that he was the thief and murderer.|$|E

25|$|The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), {{adopted in}} 1979 by the UN General Assembly and acceded to by 180 States, sets down rights for women, of freedom from {{discrimination}} and equality under the law.

Third, is the elimination of any stereotyped concept of the roles of men and women at all levels and in all forms of education.
