5|$|Banks {{was born}} in Dallas, Texas, to <b>Eddie</b> <b>and</b> Essie Banks on January 31, 1931; he was the second of twelve children. His father, who had worked in {{construction}} and was a warehouse loader for a grocery chain, played baseball for black, semi-professional teams in Texas. As a child, Banks was not very interested in baseball, preferring swimming, basketball and football. His father bought him a baseball glove for less than three dollars at a five and dime store and motivated him with nickels and dimes to play catch. His mother encouraged him to follow one of his grandfathers into {{a career as a}} minister.|$|E

Bert demands a share of Eddie's winnings and threatens that Eddie will be injured unless he pays. But Eddie says that {{if he is not}} killed he will kill Bert when he recovers; invoking the memory of Sarah, he shames Bert into giving up his claim. Instead, Bert orders Eddie never to walk into a big-time pool hall again. <b>Eddie</b> <b>and</b> Fats compliment each other as players, and Eddie walks out.|$|E
5|$|Homer and Marge wake on New Year's Day with hangovers {{after the}} family's New Year's Eve celebration. As Homer {{takes out the}} garbage, Chief Wiggum, <b>Eddie,</b> <b>and</b> Lou arrive and issue him {{multiple}} citations and fines - the result of recently passed, frivolous laws intended to bring in revenue for the city when broken. Taking Moe's suggestion that he bribe a city official to clear up the fines, Homer leaves a sack full of cash on the official's desk but is promptly arrested, convicted, and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Wiggum takes pity on Homer and tells him to meet with an FBI agent, who offers to reduce the sentence if Homer will go undercover in the prison to investigate Fat Tony, who is also serving time along with his top henchmen.|$|E
5|$|Schafer {{stated that}} they began the {{development}} with the character of <b>Eddie,</b> <b>and</b> recognizing what he should be doing in the gameâ€”specifically, swinging around his axe, playing his guitar, and driving his hot rod. Once they found this combination of elements to work well in combat and general gameplay, {{they were able to}} expand {{out the rest of the}} game from there, as these elements provided a means of testing the game to make sure it remained enjoyable. The first major feature developed for the game was the multiplayer element, given that no previous game from Double Fine had included this feature, and was the highest risk element to the game.|$|E

5|$|Darcus Allen, {{a convicted}} murderer who {{previously}} served in an Arkansas prison with Clemmons, was allegedly {{present for the}} conversation. Also on Thanksgiving, Clemmons cut off a GPS monitor which Jail Sucks Bail Bonds had secured onto his ankle. On November 28, Clemmons showed two handguns to friends <b>Eddie</b> <b>and</b> Douglas Davis and told them he planned to shoot police officers with them; the exchange was witnessed by Clemmons' half-brother Rickey Hinton, with whom he shared a house. During the exchange, Clemmons danced around with the guns in his hands, claiming to be Lucifer. He told the men he had twice tried {{to go to a}} Tacoma police station, where he planned to walk in and start shooting. The first time the station was closed, and the second time he got a flat tire on the way there, Clemmons claimed. He talked about stopping at a crowded intersection or a school and shooting people there.|$|E
5|$|A {{handful of}} pub rock acts managed to achieve {{mainstream}} success after {{the advent of}} punk rock, often being re-categorised as new wave music, including Graham Parker and the Rumour, Nick Lowe, Squeeze and Elvis Costello. London-based R pub rock bands received a major boost when The Jam kicked off the mod revival in 1977 with their debut album In the City, which mixed R standards with originals modelled on The Who's early singles. They confirmed their status as the leading mod revival band with their third album All Mod Cons (1978), on which Paul Weller's song-writing drew heavily on the British-focused narratives of the Kinks. Pub rock bands like Red Beans and Rice, The Little Roosters, The Inmates, Nine Below Zero and <b>Eddie</b> <b>and</b> the Hot Rods, became major acts in the growing mod revival scene in London. Other bands grew up to feed the desire for mod music, often combining the music of 60s mod groups with elements of punk music, including The Lambrettas, The Merton Parkas, Squire, and Purple Hearts. These acts managed to develop cult followings and some had pop hits, before the revival petered out in the early 80s. Weller broke up The Jam in 1982 and formed The Style Council, who abandoned most {{of the elements of}} punk to adopt music much more based in R and early soul. Some major figures of the movement, including Robert Palmer and Steve Winwood, re-emerged as solo artists in the early 1980s, being as defined as blue-eyed soul singers.|$|E
