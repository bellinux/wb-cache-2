5|$|Some {{authors have}} {{suggested}} that the specimen was either a runt of either the yellow-breasted <b>fruit</b> <b>dove</b> or a Treron pigeon, or a hybrid instead of a unique species; however, these views are generally considered invalid {{due in part to the}} distinctiveness of the specimen, particularly in the bare skin around the eye, and no proper evidence has suggested that the Negros <b>fruit</b> <b>dove</b> is an invalid species. It is uncertain where the dove should be placed within the genus Ptilinopus as the male's plumage, a key feature used in organizing the Ptilinopus doves, is unknown. It has been suggested that the Negros <b>fruit</b> <b>dove</b> is either most closely related to the black-naped <b>fruit</b> <b>dove</b> or represents an early colonization of the Philippines by the genus that has left no surviving close relatives. It has no known subspecies and is also known as Ripley's <b>fruit</b> <b>dove.</b>|$|E
5|$|The double-eyed fig parrot (Cyclopsitta diophthalma) {{eats the}} fruit of Ficus obliqua, {{steadily}} depositing fruity detritus on the ground. The rainbow lorikeet (Trichoglossus moluccanus) is another parrot that consumes the fruit and disperses the seeds; other Australian bird species include the southern cassowary (Casuarius casuarius), brown cuckoo-dove (Macropygia phasianella), rose-crowned <b>fruit</b> <b>dove</b> (Ptilinopus regina), wompoo <b>fruit</b> <b>dove</b> (P. magnificus), wonga pigeon (Leucosarcia melanoleuca), topknot pigeon (Lopholaimus antarcticus), silvereye (Zosterops lateralis), pied currawong (Strepera graculina), black-faced cuckoo-shrike (Coracina novaehollandae), olive-backed oriole (Oriolus sagittatus), Australasian figbird (Sphecotheres vieilloti), green catbird (Ailuroedus crassirostris), regent bowerbird (Sericulus chrysocephalus), satin bowerbird (Ptilonorhynchus violaceus), and Lewin's honeyeater (Meliphaga lewinii). The tree is an important food source for the western Polynesian species the many-coloured <b>fruit</b> <b>dove</b> (Ptilinopus perousii) and crimson-crowned <b>fruit</b> <b>dove</b> (P. porphyraceus), and has been recommended for amenity planting in Tonga for these birds. The spectacled flying fox (Pteropus conspicillatus) and grey-headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus) also eat the fruit.|$|E
5|$|The Negros <b>fruit</b> <b>dove</b> (Ptilinopus arcanus) is {{a species}} of bird in the pigeon and dove family, Columbidae. It is endemic to the island of Negros in the Philippines. This <b>fruit</b> <b>dove</b> is known from a single female {{specimen}} collected from the slopes of Mount Kanlaon {{in the northern part}} of the island. While it was found at a high elevation, it is suspected that the species originally lived in the lowland dipterocarp forests and was driven to higher elevations by habitat destruction. While some have suggested that the specimen is either a runt or a hybrid instead of a valid species, this is not widely accepted. The female Negros <b>fruit</b> <b>dove</b> was a small <b>fruit</b> <b>dove</b> with vivid dark green plumage and an ashy-grey forehead. It had a distinctive ring of bare yellow skin around its eye, and yellow fringes to some of its feathers gave it the appearance of having a yellow wingbar when perched. The throat was white, while the undertail and vent were yellow.|$|E

5|$|As {{numerous}} collectors {{had visited}} Negros prior to 1953 {{and did not}} record the species, {{it is likely that}} it was already very rare by the time of its discovery. It is suspected that the Negros <b>fruit</b> <b>dove</b> was originally a lowland species, but the destruction of forests in northern Negros forced the dove from its ideal habitat and led to its probable extinction. Today, no forest exists in northern Negros at an elevation lower than , and several searches in the 1990s of Mount Kanlaon and the surrounding area failed to discover any sign of the species' continued existence. Ornithological fieldwork has discovered that the nearby island of Panay is home to some species previously thought to be endemic to Negros, including the Negros bleeding-heart. This discovery and the presence of unexplored lowland forests on Panay give hope that the Negros <b>fruit</b> <b>dove</b> may still exist in low numbers on a nearby island. Other than the depiction of the bird on a Philippine environmental education poster in the 1990s, no conservation measures have been enacted to protect any surviving population.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to fruit and seeds, {{a number of}} other food items are taken by many species. Some, particularly the ground doves and quail-doves, eat a large number of prey items such as insects and worms. One species, the atoll <b>fruit</b> <b>dove,</b> is specialised in taking insect and reptile prey. Snails, moths, and other insects are taken by white-crowned pigeons, orange fruit doves, and ruddy ground doves.|$|E

50|$|Its {{natural habitat}} is {{subtropical}} or tropical moist lowland forests, {{and it is}} found especially in foothills where it is threatened by habitat loss due to logging. The white-headed <b>fruit</b> <b>dove's</b> diet consists of small seeded fruits and berries.|$|R
50|$|Rose-crowned <b>fruit</b> <b>doves,</b> fairy gerygones and grey fantails are {{commonly}} found in the canopies to the west. Along the beaches pied oystercatcher, bar-tailed godwits, tattlers and crested terns are often seen. Emus and brahminy kites {{can also be found}} in the park.|$|R
5|$|The {{species has}} not been {{recorded}} since the original pair of Negros fruit doves were shot in May 1953 at Mt Kanlaon. However, a local hunter in southern Negros claimed to have shot it in the nineties, which has given hope that the species may still exist, and as such the IUCN lists the Negros <b>fruit</b> <b>dove</b> as Critically Endangered, as any surviving population is likely to number fewer than 50 birds. If the species still exists, {{it is likely that}} habitat destruction for agriculture, timber, and charcoal-burning and hunting, a common problem for all other pigeons on Negros, are major threats.|$|E
5|$|Around 59 {{species of}} {{pigeons and doves}} are {{threatened}} with extinction today, about 19% of all species. Most of these are tropical and live on islands. All of the species are threatened by introduced predators, habitat loss, hunting, {{or a combination of}} these factors. In some cases, they may be extinct in the wild, as is the Socorro dove of Socorro Island, Mexico, last seen in the wild in 1972, driven to extinction by habitat loss and introduced feral cats. In some areas, a lack of knowledge means the true status of a species is unknown; the Negros <b>fruit</b> <b>dove</b> has not been seen since 1953, and {{may or may not be}} extinct, and the Polynesian ground dove is classified as critically endangered, as whether it survives or not on remote islands in the far west of the Pacific Ocean is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species have}} large natural ranges. The eared dove ranges across the {{entirety}} of South America from Colombia to Tierra del Fuego, the Eurasian collared dove has a massive (if discontinuous) distribution from Britain across Europe, the Middle East, India, Pakistan and China, and the laughing dove across most of sub-Saharan Africa, as well as India, Pakistan, and the Middle East. Other species have tiny, restricted distributions; this is most common in island endemics. The whistling dove is endemic to the tiny Kadavu Island in Fiji, the Caroline ground dove is restricted to two islands, Truk and Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands, and the Grenada dove is restricted to Grenada in the Caribbean. Some continental species also have tiny distributions; for example, the black-banded <b>fruit</b> <b>dove</b> is restricted to a small area of the Arnhem Land of Australia, the Somali pigeon is restricted to a tiny area of northern Somalia, and Moreno's ground dove is restricted to the area around Salta and Tucuman in northern Argentina.|$|E
50|$|Much {{is still}} to be learned about <b>fruit</b> <b>doves.</b> Many species are shy and {{difficult}} to observe in their natural habitat. For example, there are several species in the Philippines, {{and for most of}} them, little or nothing is known of their breeding or nesting behavior.|$|R
50|$|The <b>fruit</b> <b>doves,</b> {{also known}} as fruit pigeons, are a genus (Ptilinopus) of birds in the pigeon and dove family (Columbidae).

5|$|The family Columbidae {{previously}} {{also contained}} the family Raphidae, {{consisting of the}} extinct Rodrigues solitaire and the dodo. These species are in all likelihood part of the Indo-Australian radiation that produced the three small subfamilies mentioned above, with the <b>fruit</b> <b>doves</b> and pigeons (including the Nicobar pigeon).
