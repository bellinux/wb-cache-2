40|$|The {{application}} of program transformations and refactorings involves {{the risk of}} capturing variables, which may break the intended semantics of the transformed code. One way to resolve variable capture is by renaming of the involved identifiers. However, in a modular context, the renaming of exported declarations is undesirable (affecting a module’s clients), and the renaming of <b>imported</b> <b>declarations</b> is impos-sible (requiring changes to third-party modules). We present an algorithm name-fix that detects and elimi-nates variable capture modularly. We extend a previous non-modular version of name-fix in order to (i) minimize re-namings of exported declarations, (ii) propagate necessary renamings of exported declarations to clients, and (iii) avoid renamings of <b>imported</b> <b>declarations</b> altogether. Together with support for transitive name bindings and conflicting declara-tions, our extensions to name-fix enable the application to real-world languages that feature separate compilation. To demonstrate the applicability of name-fix, we use it to mod-ularly resolve variable capture for optimizations, refactorings, and desugarings of Lightweight Java...|$|R

40|$|This project investigates empirically whether {{retailer}} size influences their <b>direct</b> <b>importing</b> activities. Twenty three Canadian retail sectors are analyzed,classified by {{types of}} commodities {{for the year}} 2002. Two aspects of retailer size are considered, average size and size dispersion of retail establishments in a retail sector. Other explanatory factors include: the share of purchases of imports by wholesalers selling the same product category of each retailer type; Canadian production of the commodities sold in each retail sector, as a fraction of total Canadian production of the year; and three importing sources (the US and Mexico, EU and Japan and Low Cost Asian countries). Only non-highly correlated independent variables are included in each estimation. The best estimation {{suggests that there is}} significant negative correlation between average size of retail establishments and their <b>direct</b> <b>import</b> activities; and there is negative link between size dispersion of retail establishments and their <b>direct</b> <b>import</b> activities...|$|R

50|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>Imports</b> are {{products}} imported {{directly into a}} country and not through the manufacturer's authorized agent/distributor. Since there is no factory-authorized middleman involved in the import of these products, the added costs are lower and the customer pays less. In addition, many items that {{are in short supply}} or are not imported at all by the manufacturer's authorized distributors can be procured as <b>direct</b> <b>imports.</b> There is no difference in the actual products. In most cases, they are manufactured in the same place by the same people and with the same materials. Occasionally, manufacturers will give them a different name.|$|R

50|$|The {{requirements}} {{under the}} new Amendments are two-fold. First, the Lacey Act now makes it illegal to import into the United States plants that have been harvested contrary to any applicable Federal Law, State Law, Indian Tribal Law, or Foreign Law. If a plant is found to have been harvested {{in violation of the}} laws of the country where it was harvested, that plant would be subject to seizure and forfeiture if imported into the U.S. The Lacey Act also makes it unlawful, beginning December 15, 2008, to import certain plants and plant products without a Plant and Plant Product <b>import</b> <b>declaration.</b>|$|R
50|$|From the 1940s {{through the}} 1970s, many local reprints and {{translations}} of American — {{as well as}} British, European, and South American — comics were published in Australia.

50|$|In {{rapidly growing}} {{developing}} economies like India where {{the demand for}} international consumer products is growing much faster than in-country supply from authorized distributors, <b>direct</b> <b>imports</b> become {{the only way for}} consumers to procure a large set of products (especially long tail). In many cases, even if a particular product is available from an authorized middle-man, a <b>direct</b> <b>import</b> may cost much less since in-country middlemen use their exclusive territorial rights to price products much higher than in the country of origin. Perversely, in countries where such product and price arbitrage is the most obvious, the import process is typically very onerous and not easily navigated by the average consumer leaving the field open to predatory pricing from in-country middlemen.|$|R

50|$|The World Resources Institute, in {{partnership}} with the Environmental Investigation Agency, released a fact sheet designed to answer some of the frequently asked questions about the Lacey Act, which was amended in 2008 to ban commerce in illegally sourced plants and their products—including timber, wood, and paper products. The fact sheet says forest certification is a very good approach for demonstrating due care by showing government and customers that a company has taken proactive steps to eliminate illegal wood or plant material from its supply chain. Certification does not relieve importers of the requirement to submit appropriate <b>import</b> <b>declaration</b> information to U.S. government agencies.|$|R
