5|$|In 1997 a {{paper was}} {{published}} that hypothesised {{the existence of}} a binary nucleus to fully explain the observed pattern of comet Haleâ€“Bopp's dust emission observed in October 1995. The paper was based on theoretical analysis, and did not claim an observational detection of the proposed satellite nucleus, but estimated that it would have a diameter of about 30km, with the main nucleus being about 70km across, and would orbit <b>in</b> <b>about</b> <b>three</b> days at a distance of about 180km. This analysis was confirmed by observations in 1996 using Wide-Field Planetary Camera 2 of the Hubble Space Telescope which had taken images of the comet that revealed the satellite.|$|E

5|$|Wodehouse worked {{extensively}} on his books, sometimes having {{two or more}} in preparation simultaneously.

Early in his career he would produce a novel <b>in</b> <b>about</b> <b>three</b> months, but he slowed in old age to around six months. He used a mixture of Edwardian slang, quotations from and allusions to numerous poets, and several literary techniques to produce a prose style that has been compared with comic poetry and musical comedy. Some critics of Wodehouse have considered his work flippant, but among his fans are former British prime ministers and many of his fellow writers.|$|E

5|$|After {{three weeks}} of jury selection, and eight trial days, the defense made their closing {{statements}} on March 7 <b>in</b> <b>about</b> <b>three</b> hours. They presented three witnesses and then rested their case. Fischer's mother took the stand and gave her final testimony, and her version of the story. The judge told prosecutors {{that they had to}} choose to charge the defendants with capital murder or conspiracy to commit murder. The prosecution decided on the capital murder charge, and sought the death penalty for both Cisneros and Garza. The following day, the jury convicted Cisneros and Garza of capital murder for arranging Fischer's death. Neither of them showed any emotion when the verdict was given. Cisneros then removed her jewelry and was taken to the Cameron County jail with Garza. The jurors met the following day to discuss the punishment phase of the trial.|$|E
5|$|Before Chataan {{affected}} Guam, officials canceled U.S. Independence Day festivities, {{and residents}} purchased storm supplies. Although {{the center of}} the eye did not strike Guam, the eyewall affected the entire island with strong winds and heavy rainfall. The highest sustained winds were estimated at 120km/h (75mph), with gusts to 167km/h (104mph) at Andersen Air Force Base. Gusts were slightly higher at Apra Harbor, peaking at 170km/h (106mph), and gusts may have reached as high as 200km/h (125mph). Similar to its effects on Chuuk, Chataan dropped heavy rainfall on Guam, peaking at 536mm (21.1in) on Mount Almagosa; the same station reported 311mm (12.2in) <b>in</b> <b>about</b> <b>three</b> hours. The Weather Forecast Office on the island reported 265mm (10.4in) in a 24-hour period. The rains were less than 250mm (10in) in northern Guam, and were highest in the mountainous southern region where the eye crossed. While moving across the island, Chataan produced a significant storm surge that peaked at about 3.6m (12ft) in Umatac.|$|E
5|$|In mid-2005, Salzgeber's then-current Grand Prix mount, Wall Street, was euthanized {{following}} {{an episode of}} colic. This, combined with the recent retirement of Rusty, left her with no Grand Prix-level horses. Wall Street, while a relatively successful dressage horse, had suffered health problems and {{had never been able}} to compete with Rusty as Salzgeber's top horse. In 2008, Salzgeber again began competing at the Grand Prix level on Herzruf's Erbe, who would develop into one of her top international horses. In that year, the pair won the Otto Lorke Prize, given each year to the best German Grand Prix horse under 10 years old. During 2008, Salzgeber and Herzruf's Erbe had won 10 Grand Prix competitions. In 2009, the pair were expected to compete at the European Dressage Championships, but were not chosen for the German team after Herzruf's Erbe sustained an injury at a competition in July. The immediate diagnosis was a severely pulled tendon, although a later diagnosis was that the horse had strained a suspensory muscle, expected to heal <b>in</b> <b>about</b> <b>three</b> months. By early 2010, the horse was again able to be ridden, but was still not in top condition.|$|E

5|$|Influenza spreads {{around the}} world in a yearly outbreak, {{resulting}} <b>in</b> <b>about</b> <b>three</b> to five million cases of severe illness and about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths. In the Northern and Southern parts of the world, outbreaks occur mainly in winter while in areas around the equator outbreaks may occur at any time of the year. Death occurs mostly in the young, the old and those with other health problems. Larger outbreaks known as pandemics are less frequent. In the 20th century, three influenza pandemics occurred: Spanish influenza in 1918 (~50 million deaths), Asian influenza in 1957 (two million deaths), and Hong Kong influenza in 1968 (one million deaths). The World Health Organization declared an outbreak of a new type of influenza A/H1N1 to be a pandemic in June 2009. Influenza may also affect other animals, including pigs, horses and birds.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} chaetotonid gastrotrichs {{reproduce}} entirely by parthenogenesis. In these species, the male {{portions of the}} reproductive system are degenerate and non-functional, or, in many cases, entirely absent. Though the eggs have a diameter of less than 50 Âµm, they are still very large {{in comparison with the}} animals' size. Some species are capable of laying eggs that remain dormant during times of desiccation or low temperatures; these species, however, are also able to produce regular eggs, which hatch in one to four days, when environmental conditions are more favourable. The eggs of all gastrotrichs undergo direct development and hatch into miniature versions of the adult. The young typically reach sexual maturity <b>in</b> <b>about</b> <b>three</b> days. In the laboratory, Lepidodermella squamatum has lived for up to forty days, producing four or five eggs during the first ten days of life.|$|E
5|$|The {{black-necked grebe}} uses {{multiple}} foraging techniques. Insects, {{which make up}} the majority of this bird's diet, are caught either {{on the surface of the}} water or when they are in flight. It occasionally practices foliage gleaning. This grebe dives to catch crustaceans, molluscs, tadpoles, and small frogs and fish. When moulting at saline lakes, this bird feeds mostly on brine shrimp. The black-necked grebe makes a floating cup nest on an open lake. The nest cup is covered with a disc. This nest is located both in colonies and by itself. During the breeding season, which varies depending on location, this species will lay one (sometimes two) clutch of three to four eggs. The number of eggs is sometimes larger due to conspecific brood parasitism. After a 21-day incubation period, the eggs hatch, and then the nest is deserted. After about 10 days, the parents split up the chicks between themselves. After this, the chicks become independent in about 10 days, and fledge <b>in</b> <b>about</b> <b>three</b> weeks.|$|E

5|$|Flooding was {{considered}} worst in Puebla, {{and were the}} worst floods in about 400years, according to newspaper reports. A total of 21,342people evacuated their houses to 116shelters, mostly in the state's northern portion. The floods affected 16,511houses and 199schools. In TeziutlÃ¡n, {{with a population of}} about 50,000, it is estimated the city received nearly half of its annual rainfall <b>in</b> <b>about</b> <b>three</b> days. Nine entire communities became isolated due to the floods, and the small village of Patla sustained heavy damage after the Necaxa River changed its course closer to the town. Widespread landslides occurred, including over 80 in TeziutlÃ¡n alone; one mudslide there destroyed 80houses. Some of the landslides occurred along rivers and produced new lakes, but 85% of these broke within the first year. Population growth, primarily in TeziutlÃ¡n and Zaragoza, occurred in landslide-prone areas along mountains. Along Sierra Norte de Puebla, deforestation contributed to additional landslides. A landslide covered the Zacatepec River near Zempoala, creating a natural dam and a small lake. Mudslides buried at least 16people at a school in Pantepec, and a deforested hill caused a landslide in the Indigenous village of Acalama, which covered up to 170people. Most had fled to a church that was also covered, and it is estimated that only 30people survived in the village. Statewide, 263people were killed, including 107 in TeziutlÃ¡n who were buried by mudslides, becoming the worst disaster {{in the history of the}} town. In the village of Tetela de Ocampo, 31people died. In Puebla, 30,000people were injured, and 81 municipalities sustained damage, with statewide damage estimated at about $240million (2.1billion pesos).|$|E
