30|$|SDRAM {{is another}} type of {{volatile}} memory. It organizes the memory space in columns, rows, and banks. It is similar to SRAM, {{but it must be}} refreshed periodically to keep its data. It requires one specific hardware controller, which drives the timing, address multiplexing, and refreshes every cycle. Its advantages are that it is low cost and it has a large capacity. Moreover, its power consumption is lower than SRAM. As a drawback, its required SDRAM controller occupies {{a major part of the}} interface. SDRAM latency is always greater than that of regular external SRAM or FPGA on-chip memory, although some types of SDRAM can achieve higher clock frequencies than SRAM. Due to its advantages and <b>drawbacks,</b> the <b>devices</b> that work with SDRAM are usually low cost and high capacity.|$|R

This goal {{is beyond the scope of}} current continuous culture apparatus because these devices positively select mutants that evade dilution, primarily through attachment to vessel surfaces, resulting in persistent sub-populations of uncontrollable size and growth rate. Results To overcome this <b>drawback,</b> a <b>device</b> with two growth chambers periodically undergoing transient phases of sterilization was designed. The robustness of this device was assessed by propagating an E. coli strain under permanent thymine starvation for over 880 days, i. e. metabolic conditions notoriously known to lead to cell death and clogging of cultivation vessels. Ten thousand generations were required to obtain a descendant lineage that could resist thymine starvation and had recovered wild-type growth rate. Conclusions This approach provides a technological framework for the diversification and improvement of microbial strains by long-term adaptation to inescapable metabolic constraints. An E. coli strain that is totally resistant to thymineless death was selected. </p...|$|R
40|$|Domain wall {{dynamics}} in a magnetoelectric antiferromagnet is analyzed, {{and its implications}} for magnetoelectric memory applications are discussed. Cr 2 O 3 is used in the estimates of the materials parameters. It is found that the domain wall mobility has a maximum {{as a function of the}} electric field due to the gyrotropic coupling induced by it. In Cr 2 O 3, the maximal mobility of 0. 1 m/(s Oe) is reached at E = 0. 06 V/nm. Fields of this order may be too weak to overcome the intrinsic depinning field, which is estimated for B-doped Cr 2 O 3. These major <b>drawbacks</b> for <b>device</b> implementation can be overcome by applying a small in-plane shear strain, which blocks the domain wall precession. Domain wall mobility of about 0. 7 m/(s Oe) can then be achieved at E = 0. 2 V/nm.
