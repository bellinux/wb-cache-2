Complex impedance analysis in the frequency range of 100 Hz- 1 MHz {{over a wide range}} of temperature (50 – 500 °C) indicates the presence of <b>grain</b> boundary <b>effect</b> along <b>with</b> the bulk contribution. The frequency-dependent conductivity plots exhibit power law dependence, suggesting three types of conduction in the material: low-frequency (100 Hz- 1 kHz) conductivity showing long-range translational motion of electrons (frequency independent), mid-frequency (1 – 10 kHz) conductivity showing short-range hopping of charge carriers and high-frequency (10 kHz- 1 MHz) conductivity showing conduction due to localized orientation of hopping mechanism. The electrical conductivity measurement of nanocrystalline and bulk Li 2 TiO 3 with temperature shows the negative temperature coefficient of resistance (NTCR) behavior. The activation energy (0.77 eV for nano sample and 0.88 eV for bulk sample) study shows the conduction mechanism in both samples.

Grain, one indicator of scale, {{is widely used}} to determine the scaling behaviors of landscape spatial patterns represented by landscape metrics. This study compared two strategies, including a high-resolution-data-based resampling (RS) approach and a multisource and multiresolution data (MSMRD) approach, to quantify the <b>grain</b> <b>effects</b> of nine commonly used landscape metrics determined by FRAGSTATS software. Three adjacent, small watersheds in the central Loess Plateau of China were selected as study sites. Using the RS and MSMRD approaches, five and seven landscape metrics, respectively, were detected to have significant and mostly linear <b>grain</b> <b>effects.</b> The MSMRD approach was more effective in detecting <b>grain</b> <b>effects,</b> and landscape areas were found to be important in the <b>grain</b> <b>effects</b> of landscape metrics. Changing grain means changing the spatial analysis or landscape observation scales and, thus, the quality of landscape pattern information acquired, without impacting the ground-surface landscape pattern. In this sense, the analysis of scale effects through the manipulation of grains can be practically implemented in spatial data processing and selection for landscape modeling tasks. This paper also highlights gaps in present scaling research on landscape metrics by their numerical responses to grain sizes, with the conceptual and mathematical formulations largely neglected. The latter, however, is more important in research concerning landscape metrics, such as scaling, correlation, and even the interaction between landscape patterns and ecological processes...|$|R

The deformation behaviors, including inhomogeneous material flow and the decrease of flow stress with the increase of grain size for the same size of specimens, are studied.

In this study, intensive melt shearing was achieved in a twin-screw mechanism to investigate its <b>grain</b> refining <b>effect</b> on AZ 91 D magnesium alloy. The refinement mechanism was discussed and the persistence of grain refinement after remelting and isothermal holding was also studied. A Zeiss imaging system with polarized light was used for quantitative measurement of grain size.

With the application of intensive melt shearing, the grain size of AZ 91 D magnesium alloy can be reduced from 530 μm (for a typical as-cast microstructure) to 170 μm, which is about 70 % size reduction. The grain refinement achieved by the intensive melt shearing can be partially kept after isothermal holding and remelting. It is believed that the refinement effect was mainly due to the finer and well dispersed oxide particles formed by high intensive shearing. The smaller size of oxide particles and their slow motion velocity in the sheared melt could make important contributions to the remained grain refinement...|$|R
40|$|<b>Grain</b> size <b>effect</b> on the {{friction}} behaviour of polycrystalline metals in metal forming processes {{has become one}} of the most critical issues as the interfacial friction is the most dominating factor which affects the surface quality of the metal-deformed products. Although attentions have been paid to the experimental observation of <b>grain</b> size <b>effect</b> on friction coefficient, the understanding is still quite superficial, and robust conclusions are not yet obtained. To have an in-depth understanding of <b>grain</b> size <b>effect,</b> adhesion and ploughing are studied separately using pin-on-disc friction tests in this research. Different roughness and grain sizes of testing samples are designed for {{the friction}} pairs in the experiments to realise both the adhesion-dominated and ploughing-dominated frictions.

In addition, 3 D dislocation-field strain gradient plasticity simulations were employed to analyze the intrinsic size <b>effects,</b> using the <b>grain</b> size and texture as measured experimentally. 	 The work shows that for miniaturized structures with a limited number of columnar grains a unique Hall-Petch relation does not exist, even though a <b>grain</b> boundary <b>effect,</b> i. e. a decrease in stress level (at a given strain) for decreasing grain boundary area per unit volume, is clearly present. When the microstructure is kept constant upon miniaturization, the free surface per unit area increases causing the stress level of the structure to decrease, the effect of which increases towards a single grain in the cross-section. In addition, the work shows that <b>grain</b> statistics <b>effects</b> also contribute to observed weakening, due to insufficient compensation of local (weaker) material properties by the surrounding material (i. e. grains).
