Of the 11 antibiotics tested, E. faecalis was most commonly resistant to tetracycline, doxycycline, streptomycin, gentamicin, and erythromycin, and these traits were intra-species horizontally transferrable by in vitro conjugation. Profiles of E. faecalis (prevalence, antibiotic resistance, and virulence traits) from each of WWTF sludge and associated <b>house</b> <b>flies</b> were similar, indicating that flies successfully acquired these bacteria from this substrate.

They are abundant in human sewage and wastewater treatment facilities (WWTF). This study focused {{on the role of}} <b>house</b> <b>flies,</b> Musca domestica, in the ecology of enterococci at WWTF in both field and laboratory experiments. The first study objective focused on sampling and characterizing enterococci from <b>house</b> <b>flies</b> and wastewater sludge from four WWTF in northeastern Kansas. Enterococci were quantified, identified, and screened for antibiotic resistance and virulence traits, and genotyped. The profiles of enterococci (spp. diversity, antibiotic resistance and virulence) from WWTF sludge and the <b>house</b> <b>flies</b> were similar, indicating that the flies successfully acquired the bacteria from the WWTF substrate. Enterococci with the greatest amount of antibiotic resistant and virulence traits originated from the WWTF that processed meat waste from a commercial sausage plant. Genotyping of E. faecalis revealed clonal matches from sludge and <b>house</b> <b>flies.</b> The second study objective involved tracking the fate of E. faecalis in the digestive tract of <b>house</b> <b>flies</b> in laboratory assays. Colony forming unit (CFU) counts were highest in the midgut at 1 h and declined during the first 24 h. In the labellum, foregut and hindgut, E. faecalis concentrations were more variable but were overall higher after 24 h. Observations from CFU counts and visualizations under a dissecting microscope revealed that E. faecalis peaked in the crop after 48 h suggesting active proliferation in this region. The third objective of the study involved tracking the emergence of calyptrate muscoid flies from stockpiled biosolid cake at one of the four WWTF.

The larval development of both fly species takes place in decaying organic materials (primarily animal manure), resulting in large fly populations in confined cattle environments. Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) are a major foodborne pathogen. Cattle are the asymptomatic reservoir of STEC with bacteria being released to the environment via their feces. STEC O 157 is the main serogroup causing human illness. However, infections with non-O 157 STEC are increasing: more than 70 % of non-O 157 infections are caused by six serogroups of non-O 157, referred as "Big six" (O 26, O 45, O 103, O 111, O 121, and O 145). In addition, there was a large 2011 outbreak in Europe caused by STEC O 104. The objectives of my thesis were: 1) To assess the prevalence of seven serogroups of non-O 157 STEC (O 26, O 45, O 103, O 104, O 111, O 121, and O 145) (STEC- 7) in <b>house</b> <b>flies</b> and stable flies collected from confined cattle environments; 2) To investigate the vector competence of <b>house</b> <b>flies</b> for non-O 157 STEC- 7. A total of 463 <b>house</b> <b>flies</b> from feedlots and dairies from six states, and 180 stable flies collected from a feedlot in Nebraska were processed for the isolation and identification of STEC- 7 using a culture-based approach followed by PCR for the confirmation of serogroups, and virulence genes. A total of 34. 3 % of <b>house</b> <b>flies</b> and 1. 1 % of stable flies tested positive for at least one serogroup of E. coli of interest, and 1. 5 % of <b>house</b> <b>flies</b> harbored STEC with the Shiga-toxin gene (stx 1).

40|$|Abstract Background Insects may use various {{biochemical}} {{pathways to}} enable them to tolerate the lethal action of insecticides. For example, increased cytochrome P 450 detoxification is known {{to play an important role}} in many insect species. Both constitutively increased expression (overexpression) and induction of P 450 s are thought to be responsible for increased levels of detoxification of insecticides. However, unlike constitutively overexpressed P 450 genes, whose expression association with insecticide resistance has been extensively studied, the induction of P 450 s is less well characterized in insecticide resistance. The current study focuses on the characterization of individual P 450 genes that are induced in response to permethrin treatment in permethrin resistant <b>house</b> <b>flies.</b> Results The expression of 3 P 450 genes, CYP 4 D 4 v 2, CYP 4 G 2, and CYP 6 A 38, was co-up-regulated by permethrin treatment in permethrin resistant ALHF <b>house</b> <b>flies</b> in a time and dose-dependent manner. Comparison of the deduced protein sequences of these three P 450 s from resistant ALHF and susceptible aabys and CS <b>house</b> <b>flies</b> revealed identical protein sequences. Genetic linkage analysis located CYP 4 D 4 v 2 and CYP 6 A 38 on autosome 5, corresponding to the linkage of P 450 -mediated resistance in ALHF, whereas CYP 4 G 2 was located on autosome 3, where the major insecticide resistance factor(s) for ALHF had been mapped but no P 450 genes reported prior to this study. Conclusion Our study provides the first direct evidence that multiple P 450 genes are co-up-regulated in permethrin resistant <b>house</b> <b>flies</b> through the induction mechanism, which increases overall expression levels of P 450 genes in resistant <b>house</b> <b>flies.</b> Taken together with the significant induction of CYP 4 D 4 v 2, CYP 4 G 2, and CYP 6 A 38 expression by permethrin only in permethrin resistant <b>house</b> <b>flies</b> and the correlation of the linkage of the genes with resistance and/or P 450 -mediated resistance in resistant ALHF <b>house</b> <b>flies,</b> this study sheds new light on the functional importance of P 450 genes in response to insecticide treatment, detoxification of insecticides, the adaptation of insects to their environment, and the evolution of insecticide resistance. </p...|$|R
