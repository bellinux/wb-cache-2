50|$|To {{prevent the}} {{concrete}} monolith from sliding forward, {{it was decided}} to install seven cable anchors deep into the bedrock. Each anchor consisted of bundled, high strength steel cables that were concreted {{into the bottom of the}} holes. They were then hydraulically tensioned and the holes filled with grout. Anchors were installed at a 45 degree angle to a depth of 813, or 26 ft below the foundation of the ogees. On March 2, 1977 the project was bid to VSL Corporation for $254,777. Drilling for the anchors began on June 7, 1977. The <b>final</b> <b>loading</b> on each anchor was 1300 kips. On September 28, 1977, one of the anchor's foundations failed and had to be re-concreted.

40|$|International audienceElectropulse heat {{treatment}} {{is a technique}} developed to realise fast {{heat treatment}} of NiTi shape memory alloys. This study investigates mechanical behaviour of cold worked NiTi wires heat treated with such a technique. It is demonstrated that milliseconds electropulses allow to realise homogeneous heat treatments and to adapt the mechanical behaviour of NiTi wires by controlling the electric energy. The material can be made elastic with different elastic modulus, perfectly superelastic with different stress plateau levels and superelastic with important local residual strain. Due to the short duration and high temperature of the heat treatment, this technique allows to obtain mechanical properties that cannot be obtained with classical heat treatments of several minutes in conventional furnaces such as linear evolution of the <b>final</b> <b>loading</b> and high tensile strength to 1500 MPa for superelastic material or increase of the stress plateau level with cycling for superelastic material...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} a performance-based impact resistant design procedure for reinforced concrete structures, consecutive falling-weight impact loading tests were conducted under specified total input-impact energy. In this experiment, the girders have rectangular cross section of 1 m width and depth, and 8 m clear-span length. A 2, 000 kg steel weight was used and total input-impact energy was specified as 196 kJ. Three kinds of falling height of weight were set: 3. 33 m; 5 m; and 10 m. From this study, following results were obtained: (1) maximum and residual deflections were almost constant values for each input-impact energy; (2) deflections after the <b>final</b> <b>loading</b> were almost the same among all girders; and (3) accumulated residual deflections were proportional to the accumulated input-impact energy and the damage of the girder for each limit state can be precisely evaluated by means of this relationship...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Dynamic {{loading of}} code {{is a crucial}} and often {{neglected}} part of today’s distributed systems that face increasing dynamics, complexity and heterogeneity. Ubiquitous computing and mobile computing even strengthen this trend. As the local availability of suitable code cannot be assumed in such environments, we propose a generic, decentralised code loading infrastructure. The whole process of publication, look-up, implementation selection and the <b>final</b> <b>loading</b> of platform-specific code is decentralised and requires only basic peerto-peer functionality. In contrast to previous work, our infrastructure allows any peer participating in the network to offer and to obtain platform-specific code in a dynamic and heterogeneous environment. By building on our generic concept, we present a JXTA-based service for dynamic code loading, which is realised by extending and improving JXTA-built-in mechanisms for dynamic service integration. Subsequently, we show the practical application of our infrastructure by an integration into our CORBA middleware and an implementation of mobile objects and mobile web services...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTime {{independent}} inelasticity {{is often}} modelled as due to plasticity and/or damage. The difference is manifested at reversed loading; plasticity reveals itself by a remaining strain in the unloaded state while damage is revealed by {{a decrease in}} the elastic stiffness during unloading. With thin adhesive layers, the deformation is inhomogeneously distributed along the layer. Large deformations occur at the ends of the layer. In the more central parts, the layer is virtually undeformed. This makes a direct measurement of the unloading properties virtually impossible. In the present paper, novel experiments are performed in order to evaluate the inelastic properties of epoxy adhesives. The load is first increased to a level corresponding to 50, 60, 70 or 80 % of the fracture energy. The load is then reversed. The first step creates a zone of inelastically deformed adhesive {{at the start of the}} layer. During a <b>final</b> <b>loading</b> phase, the properties of this zone are analysed. Major differences due to the loading direction are observed. Some comparisons with simulation models are performed...|$|E
40|$|Fluorescent silica nanoparticles, Cornell dots (C dots), were {{incorporated}} into electrospun cellulose acetate (CA) fibers. Two types of C dots were used in this study. The first type was comprised of a fluorescent dye-containing silica core surrounded by a silica shell. These nanoparticles fluoresce at 572 nm when exposed to 541 nm light. Increasing C dot loading in the spinning dope above 10 % w/w {{did not result in}} an increase in C dot content within the final fibers. Scanning electron microscopy indicated that the nanoparticle incorporation had very little effect on the fiber morphology. The mechanical properties of the electrospun fabrics were not negatively affected by C dot addition, even though <b>final</b> <b>loading</b> constituted nearly one-third of the weight of the fibers. A second type of C dots, with both a fluorescent core and a pH-sensitive shell, were also incorporated in CA fibers. These C dots fluoresce at both 572 nm as described above, and at 518 nm, when exposed to 488 nm light. Fluorescence intensity at 541 nm increased with increasing pH.

40|$|Conventional solid {{reinforced}} concrete (RC) beams were modified to slotted beams for consideration as thermal insulation structural components. The slotted beam consisted of an outer and an inner beam, respectively, with a slot {{located near the}} middle of the beam along its width direction for filling thermal insulation material. Flexural and thermal behavior of the slotted beams were investigated. Three RC reference solid beams and six slotted beams were fabricated and tested under four-point bending tests. The test results indicated that the failure mode of both slotted beams and the solid beams was flexural failure. However, the damage process of the slotted beams was {{different from that of the}} solid beams at the <b>final</b> <b>loading</b> stage. The moment curvature analysis indicated that the tensile reinforcement ratio of the outer and inner beams had an important effect on the flexural behavior, especially the ductility of the slotted beams.

In addition, FE simulation results showed that a new frame structure using slotted beams exhibited obvious and attractive thermal insulation property...|$|E
40|$|It {{is fair to}} {{say that}} the general {{seakeeping}} problem of ship advancing with arbitrary forward speed in rough waves is still a challenge and no fully satisfactory numerical model exists up to now. Indeed physics involved in this problem is extremely complex and includes many different physical phenomena which can not be handled by a single complete model. The usual practice consists in subdividing the problem into simpler problems targeting the specific applications. One of the very important practical problems concerns the slamming loads and their effects on ship structural responses. This is the main focus of the present paper. Only potential flow models for fluid flow are discussed and that both for seakeeping and slamming. Seakeeping model in time domain is constructed from the frequency domain data using the method proposed by Cummins 1962 and Ogilvie 1964. Once in the time domain slamming events are identified and treated using the strip approach with Generalized Wagner Model (GWM) for each strip.

40|$|The {{overturning}} {{failure of}} a 13 storey residential building in Shanghai, China, has been investigated by plane strain finite element analysis (FEA). The results of the FEA indicate that ultimate failure of the building was probably initiated by the formation of tensile cracking in the reinforced concrete piles located under {{the side of the}} building adjacent to an excavation. This eventually led to complete structural failure of the piles located along the excavation side, which probably caused further settlement of the building, leading eventually to a toppling failure resulting in overturning of the entire building. Excessive tensile stress in the piles was probably caused by the combination of excavation of soil at one side of the building and the temporary dumping of the excavated soil on the opposite side of the building. It is likely that the effect of temporary dumping of the excavated soil adjacent to the building was either not considered or not properly taken into account in the foundation design nor the construction operations. A simple but important lesson to be draw from this failure is the need for engineers who design foundations in soft soil regions to consider not only the <b>final</b> <b>loading</b> conditions, but also any temporary and transient loading conditions during the construction process...|$|E
