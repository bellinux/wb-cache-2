Large numbers of ducks winter along the coast, including many Eurasian wigeons, Eurasian teals, mallards and gadwalls, goldeneyes and northern pintails. Red-throated divers are usually on the sea, and brent geese feed on sea lettuce and other green algae.

40|$|International audienceMany {{different}} {{behavioural changes}} have been observed in wild waterfowl during the flightless stage of wing moult with birds frequently becoming inactive and reducing time spent foraging. Increased predation risk, elevated energetic demands of feather re-growth and restriction of foraging opportunities are thought to underlie these changes. By studying captive populations of both a dabbling and a diving duck species at the same site, we determined whether captive birds would reflect the behavioural responses of wild waterfowl to moult. The time-budgets of 42 Common Eiders,, (a diving duck) and 18 <b>Garganeys,,</b> (a dabbling duck) were recorded during wing moult (July–August) and non-moult (January) with behaviour recorded under six categories. Despite captivity providing a low predation risk and constant access to food, birds altered their behaviour during the flightless period of wing moult. Time allocated to foraging and locomotion decreased significantly during moult compared to non-moult periods, while resting time increased significantly. Moulting Eiders underwent a greater reduction in time spent foraging and in locomotion compared with <b>Garganeys,</b> {{which is likely to}} be in response to a higher energetic cost of foraging in Eiders. It is possible that increased resting in both diving and dabbling ducks reduces their likelihood of detection by predators, while allowing them to remain vigilant. We demonstrate that there is much potential for using captive animals in studies that can augment our knowledge of behaviours of free-living conspecifics, the former being a hitherto under-exploited resource...|$|R

Totally throughout the period, specific antibodies to the viruses were detected by neutralization test in wild birds (7. 3 %, WN; 8. 0 %, Geta; 0. 7 % Batai; 2. 8 %, Alpine hare (Lepus timidus); by hemagglutination-inhibition test in cattle (11. 4 % WN; 5. 9 %, JE; j 3. 0 %, TBE; 11. 6 %, Geta), horses (6. 1, 6. 8, 0, and 25. 3 %, respectively), and pigs (5. 4, 1. 5, 0, and 5. 9 %, respectively) by enzyme immunoassay (IgG) in human beings (0. 8, 0. 5, 6. 8, and 3. 2 %, respectively. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to reveal RNA of the NP segment of influenza A virus in 57. 9 and 65 % of the cloacal swabs from wild and domestic birds, respectively; and the HA-segment of subtype HH was not detected in 2005. HA/H 5 RNA was recorded in 5. 5 and 6. 7 % of the swabs from wild and domestic birds, respectively; 6 % of the specimens from domestic birds were M-segment positive in 2006. RNA of influenza A virus NA/H 7 and RNA was not detected throughout the years. In 2004, the cloacal swabs 8 isolated influenza A strains: two H 3 N 8 and two H 4 N 8 strains from European teals (Anas crecca), two (H 3 N 8 and H 6 N 2) strains from Baikal teals (A. formosa), one (H 10 N 4) strain from shovelers (A. clypeata), and one (H 4 N 8) from <b>garganeys</b> (A. querquedula). In 2004, one ND virus strain was isolated from the cloacal swabs from European teals (A. crecca).

But he never minded the birds nor hurt them, because they were not in season; indeed, he minded but two things in the whole world, and those were, his Bible and his grouse; for he was as good an old Scotchman as ever knit stockings on a winter's night: only, when all the birds were going, he toddled out, and took off his cap to them, and wished them a merry journey and a safe return; and then gathered up all the feathers which they had left, and cleaned them to sell down south, and make feather- beds for stuffy people to lie on.|$|R
500|$|The typical {{image of}} {{migration}} is of northern landbirds, such as swallows (Hirundinidae) and birds of prey, making long flights to the tropics.
