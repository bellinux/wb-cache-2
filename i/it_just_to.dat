25|$|The {{majority}} of the Sixth Avenue Line has four tracks, two local and two express. At each end, these pairs of tracks split, giving the line two north and two south ends. One of the north ends is at 57th Street, where two tracks lead south under Sixth Avenue from the IND 63rd Street Line (used by the F train at all times). The other is just south of 59th Street–Columbus Circle, where a two-track line splits from the IND Eighth Avenue Line at a flying junction (with connections to the local and express tracks), immediately turns east under 53rd Street, and crosses the IND Queens Boulevard Line, which parallels <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> the north. At Seventh Avenue, the southbound track is above the northbound track (the same is true on the Queens Boulevard Line, though north is the opposite direction from the Sixth Avenue Line). These tracks are used by the B and D express trains.|$|E
500|$|Berkowitz (real name Scott Putesky) later {{claimed to}} have been [...] "shut out" [...] of {{recording}} sessions, and alleged that other band members destroyed much of his equipment—the four-track recorder, which had been used to produce many of the band's early demos, had been microwaved, and his drum machine had been discarded. The latter was subsequently revealed to have been thrown from a second-story window. He was also highly critical of Reznor, whom he alleged destroyed a Fender Jaguar which had been given to him by his father as a child, saying: [...] "I was in the studio, and they were all in the control room, and I'm playing guitar. At the end, Trent says, 'Do it again, but do it more like this.' We went through this three times, and he says, 'Hold on. I'll come in there. Let me show you what I'm talking about.' So I take my guitar off, hand it to him—and he smashes <b>it,</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> fuck with me. Then he laughed and left the room." ...|$|E

2500|$|Opponents to {{the bill}} stood largely behind two {{different}} principles. Some of them, with Andrew Fisher being perhaps the best known, fully agreed about the danger threatening Australia if the war was lost, and with the consequent necessity of carrying on the war with the utmost power that could be developed. However, {{they believed that the}} best effort that could be mustered would be as a result of voluntary efforts only, and the effort to introduce conscription to a nation that did not feel directly threatened would only cause infighting and actually hamper the war effort. The other group of opponents, led by default by Frank Tudor and T. J. Ryan, argued that whilst it may be justifiable to compel men to do many things, compelling them to take life and risk their own came in a different category.

Bob, his father, is a sculptor. After Van Persie's parents divorced he was brought up by his father. At school, Van Persie {{was one of the}} most misbehaved children and was excluded from class almost daily. [...] After joining Arsenal in England, Van Persie settled in Hampstead, an affluent suburb of north London. Van Persie is married to Moroccan Bouchra Elbali and the couple have two children, a son named Shaqueel and daughter Dina. When asked if this caused him to convert to Islam, Van Persie said, [...] "It's not true. I am not a Muslim, nor a Christian or a Jew. I have been raised liberally.

2500|$|In a Rolling Stone {{interview}} in 2000, Rose mentioned {{that part of}} the delay of the album was him [...] "educating himself about the technology that's come to define rock", stating, [...] "It's like from scratch, learning how to work with something, and not wanting <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> be something you did on a computer." [...] The album was reportedly near completion in mid-2000 when producer Roy Thomas Baker convinced Rose to re-record the entire album, causing further delays. In 2004, bassist Tommy Stinson stated that the album was [...] "almost done" [...] and that it was held back by [...] "legal issues". Stinson also said delays were caused by Rose making sure every band member had a say in each song, mentioning that [...] "it's a lengthy process because you have to get eight people to basically write a song together that everyone likes." [...] Stinson also stated Rose was a perfectionist and an engineer involved on the album claimed that [...] "Axl wanted to make the best record that had ever been made. It's an impossible task. You could go on infinitely, which is what they've done." [...] Geffen A Tom Zutaut stated the record [...] "could have been out by September 2002".|$|E

Rose mentioned {{that part of the}} delay of the new album was him 'educating himself about the technology that's come to define rock', stating that [...] "it's like from scratch, learning how to work with something, and not wanting <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> be something you did on a computer." [...] Rolling Stone described the album as [...] "Led Zeppelin's Physical Graffiti remixed by Beck and Trent Reznor. Rose mentioned that the expense of the record would be negated by the recording sessions yielding multiple albums, including a record that is [...] "more industrial and electronica-influenced than Chinese Democracy". At that point, the album had gone through multiple producers, including Youth, Moby, Mike Clink, Roy Thomas Baker, Eric Caudieux. At the time, Sean Beavan was producing, but Caram Costanzo and Axl Rose became the final credited producers on the album. The album had been completely re-recorded several times with varying musicians and producers. In a 2001 interview, Rose described the album as having [...] "all kinds of styles, many influences as blues, mixed in the songs" [...] and said that it was [...] "not industrial".|$|E

2500|$|New South Wales had won 10 Sheffield Shields on the trot - {{though they}} would be ousted by Victoria {{by the end of}} the season - and had a team that was {{stronger}} than most Test sides; captain Richie Benaud, vice-captain Neil Harvey, Bobby Simpson, Grahame Thomas, Norm O'Neill, Brian Booth, Alan Davidson, Ray Flockton, Johnny Martin and Frank Misson. Ted Dexter won the toss and batted of course, but the MCC innings hinged on Geoff Pullar's 132. Even that was lucky as the Lancashire opener edged the ball to Simpson in the first over who dropped <b>it,</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> show that even the best slip fielders are not infallible. Pullar continued to struggle and give other chances, but he put this behind him and stuck to his work, which was just as well as only Dexter (42) and Cowdrey (50) stayed to help him out. 180/2 sank to 303/9 thanks to Benaud (3/61) and Martin (4/122), but tailend [...] "George" [...] thumped 30 to bring the total up to 348 a few minutes before stumps. Thomas survived one ball from Fred Trueman, successfully appealed for light and they all trooped back to the pavilion. On the second day Dexter resorted to his negative tactics of bowling on the leg stump with an on-side field, which was meant to restrict strokeplay. In this he failed as New South Wales rattled up 408/5 in the day, causing Benaud the remark that he had better change his way of thinking. Grahame Thomas was quickly bowled by Trueman (1/45), who then left the field with fibrositis and the MCC bowling attack lost all its bite. Simpson made 110 – his fourth hundred in four matches – and added 234 for the second wicket with Norm O'Neill, who had lost a few pounds and overcame his bad form to make 143 like a man on a mission. Booth (41), Harvey (63), Davidson (55), Flockton (62 not out) and Benaud (40 not out) kept the scoreboard moving at a fair rate and Benaud declared during the lunch break on the third day having made 124 runs in that morning to bring the total to 532/6. Davidson (1/11) removed David Sheppard for 7 and then it was all the spinners. Benaud took his best first class innings haul of 18-10-18-7 and Martin (2/32) picked up the wickets of Dexter and Cowdrey as the tourists crumbled to 104 all out to lose by an innings and 80 runs. It was New South Wales first innings victory over the MCC, and by definition their greatest victory over the English tourists.|$|E
