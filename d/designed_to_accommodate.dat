The station was unusual in being {{designed}} for horses, with access ramps instead of steps and with unusually high entrances <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> a horse and rider. In 1997 the railway was replaced by Tramlink; the station is now Woodside tram stop.|$|E

The wide streets encourage cafes, pubs and restaurants to provide pavement seating. Lying between the offices at the Golden Mile Great West Road and Hammersmith, office developments and warehouse conversions to offices began from the 1960s. The first in 1961 was 414 Chiswick High Road {{on the site of}} the old Empire Cinema. Between 1964 and 1966, the 18-storey IBM headquarters was built above Gunnersbury station, <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> 1500 people.

5000|$|The Camden bench {{received}} {{criticism as}} being {{a prime example of}} a wider trend of urban design that is anti-homeless, known as hostile architecture. The designers contend that: [...] "Homelessness should never be tolerated in any society and if we start <b>designing</b> in <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> homeless then we have totally failed as a society. Close proximity to homelessness unfortunately makes us uncomfortable so perhaps it is good that we feel that and recognise homelessness as a problem rather than <b>design</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> it." ...|$|R

5|$|The keep was {{designed}} as a private tower for Hamelin Plantagenet, rather than a grander residence. As a result, it was not <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> several different households and its layout was simpler than that seen at the contemporary keep of Orford Castle, for example. The 2nd and the 3rd floor would have served as the main chamber and the lord's private chamber, forming a vertical sequence of rooms, with a vaulted, hexagonal chapel leading off the private chamber, cut into one of the buttresses.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{supervision}} of foreign architects, namely the German C. Sandreczki, the Boromphiman Throne Hall became the most modern building within the Grand Palace; {{it was also the}} first to be <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> carriages and motorcars. The exterior walls are embellished with pilasters and elaborate plaster designs. The triangular and semi-circular pediments are decorated with stuccoed floral motifs. The palace's distinctive Mansard roof is covered in dark grey slate tiles. On the façade of the building, the main and central pediment show the emblem of the crown prince.|$|E
5|$|ArtRave's {{concept and}} name {{are derived from}} the {{similarly}} named release party for Artpop. The stage resembled a cave and consisted of two sections connected by catwalks made of translucent lucite, allowing the audience to move underneath the catwalks while still being able to watch the show. Gaga's costumes in the show included one with tentacles, one with bejeweled wings, a rave-inspired outfit and a necklace made of marijuana leaves. Costume designers and choreographers aspired to make a single, coherent show. The lighting fixtures used for the concert were from Clay Paky and the main idea was to create an immersive rave experience with the lights. They were also <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> minor changes in the show sequences.|$|E

5|$|Every {{character}} {{has been given}} their own unique ability. For example, Jazz can fire a grappling hook to reach high or distant places, Optimus Prime can command the massive Metroplex, and the Combaticons {{have the ability to}} combine into the Decepticon Bruticus. Segments in which players control Bruticus are <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> its larger size. Scale is maintained so the character towers over enemies. The Autobot Grimlock, who transforms into a dinosaur, is controlled differently than other characters. Carrying only a sword and shield, Grimlock cannot transform at will, instead accumulating rage as he battles opponents. When he gains enough rage, Grimlock is able to transform and inflict massive damage. The online cooperative campaign play featured in the first game has been removed in favor of levels that utilize each character's specific abilities.|$|E
5|$|On Jan. 11, 2016, the Klein ISD Board of Trustees {{approved}} the Design Development for Intermediate School #10. Huckabee Architects has designed the 205,000 sf. campus in three separate learning areas: 6th Grade, 7th & 8th Grade STEM, and 7th & 8th Grade Humanities. It is <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> a site on West Rayford Rd next to Metzler Elementary with a 20ft. elevation change that runs front to back, {{as well as}} 2 acres of protected wetlands. Per the current instructional program for intermediate schools, the campus includes a Black Box theater classroom that is being designed to combine as a stage, collaboration areas within the communities for project-based learning and small group instruction, and Makerspace in the library or learning commons. The estimated completion date is Fall 2018.|$|E
5|$|Commandant Teste was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> {{the naval}} {{version of the}} Farman F.60 Goliath torpedo bomber, but they were {{obsolete}} when she was commissioned in 1932. Biplane Levasseur PL.14 torpedo bomber floatplanes were only briefly used as they proved to be too fragile for landing at sea. They were replaced by improved Levasseur PL.15 biplanes from July–August 1934. The Latécoère 298 monoplane replaced the PL.15 in March–May 1939. The scouting squadron was initially equipped with fixed-wing Gourdou-Leseurre GL-810 floatplanes until the folding wing Gourdou-Leseurre GL-811 arrived in October 1933. They were replaced in turn by the improved Gourdou-Leseurre GL-813 in early 1936. The larger Loire 130 flying boat replaced the GL-813 from April 1938, although the catapults had to be modified to handle their greater weight. No fighter seaplanes were ever embarked on Commandant Teste, although the Loire 210 floatplane was designed for the role. However, {{it proved to be}} greatly out-classed by contemporary land-based fighters and only 20 were built in 1939.|$|E

5|$|Excavation {{evidence}} {{from all the}} imperial borders which suggests that late forts were <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> much smaller garrisons than their predecessors from the Principate. Where such sites can be identified with forts listed in the Notitia, {{the implication is that}} the resident units were also smaller. Examples include the Legio II Herculia, created by Diocletian, which occupied a fort just one-seventh the size of a typical Principate legionary base, implying a strength of c. 750 men. At Abusina on the Danube, the Cohors III Brittonum was housed in a fort only 10% the size of its old Trajanic fort, suggesting that it numbered only around 50 men. The evidence must be treated with caution as identification of archaeological sites with placenames in the Notitia is often tentative and again, the units in question may be detachments (the Notitia frequently shows the same unit in two or three different locations simultaneously). Nevertheless, the weight of the archaeological evidence favours small sizes for frontier units. Archaeological evidence suggests that the army in Britain in ca. 400 just one-third its size in 200 (17,500 effectives versus 55,000).|$|E
5|$|Following {{the pattern}} {{adopted by the}} earlier tube lines, each of the UERL's lines was {{constructed}} {{as a pair of}} circular tunnels using tunnelling shields with segmental cast iron tunnel linings bolted together and grouted into place as the shield advanced. Generally the tunnels followed surface roads and were constructed side by side, but where the width of the road above was insufficient, tunnels were placed one above the other. Stations on all three lines were provided with surface buildings designed by the UERL's architect Leslie Green in a standardised style modified for each site. These consisted of two-storey steel-framed buildings faced with red glazed terracotta blocks with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. The stations had flat roofs and were <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> upward extension for commercial development. Most stations were provided with between two and four lifts and an emergency spiral staircase in a separate shaft. At platform level, the wall tiling featured the station name and an individual geometric pattern and colour scheme designed by Green.|$|E
5|$|In 1731, the {{government}} purchased houses {{at the site}} of the present building and construction of a new building started the next year. The Sabor first met in the new building on 6 May 1737. The building was originally <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> archives, the court and the office of the ban; however, {{the government}} of Zagreb County moved in as well in 1765. The ban's office, the court and the archives moved out of the building in 1807, when a building across St. Mark's Square was bought to accommodate them. Subsequently, the newly purchased building was named Banski dvori after its new primary purpose of housing the ban and his office. The Zagreb County government purchased buildings adjacent to the parliament in 1839 and commissioned a new building at the site. It was completed in 1849; in the meantime, the Sabor had to convene elsewhere; it met in a theatre building located on a corner of the square. The theatre building later became the Zagreb City Hall.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the major}} changes from the 1370s onwards was the {{adaptation}} of the town walls to mount gunpowder weapons. At this time cannon were still unreliable, only capable of reaching relatively short ranges and required the construction of specialist gunports. Cannons fired stone cannonballs, which did relatively little damage to stronger stone walls, and so were primarily used in defence of fortifications {{rather than as an}} offensive weapon by besiegers. The first gunports in Britain were installed in the 1360s on the Isle of Wight, but Southampton was not far behind. Around 1378 to 1379 the ongoing French threat led to gunports for handguns being built into the western Arcade wall, and by 1382 the town bought its own gun. God's House Tower was built to defend the southern quays around 1417 and the sluices that controlled the level of the town's moats, and equipped with numerous gunports rooftop firing points, and by 1439 Catchcold tower had also been constructed, again <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> gunpowder weapons.|$|E
5|$|Production of the German Leopard 2 {{and the new}} 120mm {{tank gun}} began in 1979, {{fulfilling}} an order for the German Army. Although the American M1 Abrams was originally armed with the M68A1 105mm gun (a version of the L7), the United States Army had planned to fit the tank with a larger main gun at a later date, and the tank's turret had been <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> a larger 120mm gun. The larger gun was integrated into the M1A1 Abrams, with the first vehicle coming off the production line in 1985 The gun, known as the M256, {{was based on the}} L/44 tank gun, although manufactured at Watervliet Arsenal and modified to increase the resistance of the barrels to fracture and fatigue. Tanks armed with versions of Rheinmetall's gun produced under licence include Japan's Type 90 and South Korea's K1A1. The gun had made a huge turn in technological history.|$|E
5|$|The game's setting, Kyrat, is {{a fictional}} {{country in the}} Himalayas region. When {{building}} Kyrat, the developers merged elements from real-world regions including Nepal and Tibet, but exaggerated those elements. The map's size {{is similar to that}} of Far Cry 3, but is more dense, diverse, and features more varied environments. The developers hoped that players could experience a sense of exploration when traveling between the different terrains. The team also hoped that the new location could be believable, while remaining interesting for players. As a result, they created an identify for Kyrat by doing such things as adding different signboards to the game and creating a fictional mythology and religion for Kyrat. The game's world was also <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> new features such as the helicopter and the grappling hook. In an effort to make the world feel real, the team added improvements to the design of side-quests. Instead of simply being activities for players to complete, the quests are narrative-driven, which was done to increase the connection between them and the world. In order to increase the credibility of the game's world, the studio sent a team to Nepal to experience and record the local culture, so that they could bring those ideas back to the studio. According to the developer, the trip changed the game's design; the focus shifted from the game's civil war, which is inspired by the real-world Nepalese Civil War, to developing unique and interesting characters.|$|E
