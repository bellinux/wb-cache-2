5|$|Nectar- and pollen-eating bats {{are able}} to <b>hover,</b> {{in a similar way}} to hummingbirds. The sharp leading edges of the wings can create vortexes which provide lift. The vortex may be {{stabilized}} by the animal changing its wing curvatures.|$|E
5|$|The Dalek {{ability to}} fly or <b>hover</b> {{dates back to}} The Chase, where a Dalek was implied to have taken flight, while in Revelation of the Daleks, a Dalek hovered to exterminate two victims. The {{first part of the}} 1988 serial Remembrance of the Daleks shows a Dalek who was clearly seen to <b>hover</b> up a flight of stairs to the Doctor's horror. Rose and Adam allude to a long-held fan joke about the Daleks' {{inability}} to climb stairs, and are horrified when it does so.|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{foraging}} technique of Ospreys Pandion haliaetus during different wind speed conditions at Lake Hammarsjon, Sweden in autumn 2003. Different fishing techniques were {{used with a}} shift in relation to wind speed: (1) without <b>hovering,</b> (2) <b>hovering</b> with pure flapping flight, (3) <b>hovering</b> with flapping flight and gliding into the wind, and (4) <b>hovering</b> with pure gliding. The results supported our predictions that <b>hovering</b> is constrained at low wind speeds and gliding restricted to wind speeds exceeding 7 m/s. Mixing flapping and gliding flight when <b>hovering</b> may be done as a trade-off between increased fishing efficiency associated with flapping flight and energy-saving combined with gain in total <b>hovering</b> time associated with gliding intervals. The relationship between <b>hovering</b> time and wind speed differed significantly between males and females. At wind speeds up to about 3. 0 m/s, the <b>hovering</b> time increased more steeply with increasing wind speed for males than for females. In contrast, <b>hovering</b> time was shorter for males than for females at high wind speeds. The juveniles showed a lower mean, smaller scatter, and less increase in <b>hovering</b> time along the wind speed gradient...|$|R

5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Wataru Takeishi. The video opens with Utada entering a warehouse, and lifts a tarp off a <b>hover</b> cycle. As the camera pans away from the bike, Utada sits down and starts the bike. The first verse opens with Utada singing to the camera in a warehouse, whilst intercut scenes have her driving throughout Shibuya, Japan. As the verse progresses, two more clones of Utada appear and sing behind the original Utada. As the chorus starts, the <b>hover</b> cycle starts grinding against the road as she rides through small streets and corners. During the second verse, Utada stops through a city centre as shots of the clones appear on city billboards. She takes of her goggles, {{and stares at the}} moon, while close-up of the clone's faces are seen singing to the track.|$|E

40|$|Asteroid body-fixed <b>hovering</b> problem using nonideal {{solar sail}} models in a compact form with {{controllable}} sail area is investigated in this paper. The nonlinear dynamic equations for the <b>hovering</b> problem are constructed for a spherically symmetric asteroid. The feasible region for the body-fixed <b>hovering</b> is solved {{from the above}} equations by using a shooting method. The effect of the sail models, including the ideal, optical, parametric and solar photon thrust, on the feasible region is studied through numerical simulations. The influence of the asteroid spinning rate and the sail area-to-mass ratio on the feasible region is discussed in a parametric way. The required sail orientations and their corresponding variable lightness numbers are given for different <b>hovering</b> radii to identify the feasibility of the body-fixed <b>hovering.</b> An attractive mission scenario is introduced to enhance {{the advantage of the}} solar sail <b>hovering</b> mission.

40|$|<b>Hovering</b> {{information}} is a mobile computing paradigm where pieces of self-organizing information are responsible {{to find their}} own storage on top of a dynamic set of mobile devices. Once deployed, the <b>hovering</b> information service acts as a location-based service for disseminating Geo-localized information generated by and aimed at mobile users. It supports a wide range of pervasive applications, from urban security to stigmergy-based systems. A piece of <b>hovering</b> {{information is}} attached to a geographical point, called the anchor location, and to its vicinity area, called the anchor area. A piece of <b>hovering</b> information is responsible for keeping itself alive, available and accessible to other devices within its anchor area. It does not rely on any central server.

5|$|In this game, Mario {{is joined}} by a robotic {{backpack}} named FLUDD (Flash Liquidizing Ultra Dousing Device), which uses the power of water to clean away goop and help Mario reach new places. Mario starts with two default nozzles for FLUDD, Squirt and <b>Hover,</b> which he can quickly switch between. The Squirt nozzle lets Mario spray a stream of water which he can use to clean sludge, attack enemies, and activate certain mechanisms. The <b>Hover</b> nozzle lets Mario <b>hover</b> {{in the air for}} a short period of time, allowing him to cross large gaps while simultaneously spraying things directly below him. As the game progresses, Mario unlocks two additional nozzles for FLUDD which can be substituted with the <b>Hover</b> nozzle: the Rocket nozzle, which shoots Mario high up into the air; and the Turbo nozzle, which moves Mario at high speeds, allowing him to run across water and break into certain areas. Each of FLUDD's nozzles use water from its reserves, which can be refilled via water sources such as rivers or fountains. There are also some areas where FLUDD is taken away from Mario, forcing him to rely on his natural platforming abilities. At certain points in the game, Mario may come across an egg which hatches into a Yoshi after being brought a fruit he asks for. Yoshi can be ridden upon and can attack by spitting juice, which can clear certain obstacles that water cannot. Yoshi can also use his tongue to eat enemies or other pieces of fruit which change his color, depending on the type of fruit. Yoshi will disappear if he runs out of juice or falls into deep water. Juice can be replenished by eating more fruit.|$|E

5|$|After 400–500 {{accumulated}} degree-days above , adults {{begin to}} emerge from trees in late spring, and peak emergence occurs around 1000 degree-days. After emergence, adults feed for one week on ash leaves in the canopy before mating, but cause little defoliation in the process. Males <b>hover</b> around trees, locate females by visual cues, and drop directly onto the female to mate; mating can last 50 minutes, and females may mate with multiple males over their lifespan. A typical female can live around six weeks and lay approximately 40–70 eggs, but females that live longer can lay up to 200 eggs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} location-based service for {{disseminating}} geo-localised information generated by and aimed at mobile users. The service itself {{works in a}} self-organising manner. A piece of <b>hovering</b> information {{is attached to a}} geographical point, called the anchor location, and to its vicinity area, called the anchor area. It is responsible for keeping itself alive, available and accessible to other devices within its anchor area. <b>Hovering</b> information uses mechanisms such as active hopping, replication and dissemination among mobile nodes to satisfy the above requirements. It does not rely on any central server. Previous results involving a single piece of <b>hovering</b> information have shown the interest of the concept. This paper reports on a series of simulations involving multiple pieces of <b>hovering</b> information. Our goal is to investigate the scalability of the technique up to 200 pieces in a small geographic area. Two main replication algorithms for pieces of <b>hovering</b> information are compared, an Attraction Point algorithm and a Broadcast-based one. These replication algorithms are combined with two different caching policies, Location-based and Generation-based, for discarding <b>hovering</b> information pieces from mobile nodes buffer when memory is not enough. ...|$|R
