500|$|Lochte said he {{was pleased}} with his {{performance}} at the 2011 World Aquatics Championships but feels that he can improve his times before the 2012 Olympics. [...] "Getting five gold medals is definitely great, but the times that I went, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> go a lot faster," [...] he said. [...] "There {{are a lot of}} places in my races that I messed up on that I could have changed and gone faster, but I guess I have a whole year to make sure I have those perfect swims." ...|$|E
2500|$|On his eightieth birthday, Carmichael was reflective, observing, [...] "I'm a bit {{disappointed}} in myself. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have accomplished {{a hell of}} a lot more... I could write anything any time I wanted to. But I let other things get in the way.... I've been floating around in the breeze." [...] He spent his final years at home in Rancho Mirage, near Palm Springs, California, where he continued to play golf and remained an avid coin collector.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{liked to}} say that I had a million dollar arm and a ten cent head. As I look back on my career I do regret that I wasn't more serious. I wish I had taken the game more serious because <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{have done a lot}} better. But I do have the memories. A lot of guys I played with and against are now scouts for major league teams and we stay in touch from time to time. I made a lot of friends and had a lot of fun."

5000|$|Speaking {{about the}} [...] "meaning" [...] {{of his work}} he has said [...] "Even if <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>know</b> what <b>I</b> thought it meant." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How can I ever {{thank you}} for what you've done for me?" [...] she said. [...] "You've done me a great service. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> trust you." ...|$|R
2500|$|On August 8, 2007, Boston Celtics {{general manager}} Danny Ainge and head coach Doc Rivers {{discussed}} {{with him about}} joining their revamped roster including Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen, and longtime Celtic Paul Pierce in a reserve role. [...] On August 12, his former coach Rick Carlisle {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "we (Miller and I) talked about it and agreed that it was something that deserved careful consideration." [...] On August 24, 2007, his 42nd birthday, Miller decided against any comeback, stating: [...] "Physically, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have done it. But mentally, when you do something like this, you've either got to be all in or all out. And I've decided I'm all out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{perfectly}} beastly! Can't {{it be done}} somehow? There must be a way. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> buy a small Gallery for {{ten thousand}} pounds." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Trevor, [...] "there's no {{question}} of my getting out of it. I daresay I could. In fact, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> But I'm not going to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> {{should like}} to <b>know</b> whether you {{consider}} yourselves American or English," [...] she broke out. [...] "If once <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> talk to you accordingly." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "remembered: 'Then at 16 I got {{a part in}} [...] "The Trial of Mary Duggan" [...] at the Grand Opera House. And <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{not turn}} back.' ...|$|R
60|$|Of {{the manner}} and {{extent to which}} he took our trumps into custody, and came out with mean little cards {{at the ends of}} hands, before which the glory of our Kings and Queens was utterly abased, I say nothing; nor, of the feeling that I had, {{respecting}} his looking upon us personally in the light of three very obvious and poor riddles that he had found out long ago. What I suffered from, was the incompatibility between his cold presence and my feelings towards Estella. It was not that <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never bear to speak to him about her, that <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never bear to hear him creak his boots at her, that <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never bear to see him wash his hands of her; it was, that my admiration should be within a foot or two of him,--it was, that my feelings should be in the same place with him,--that, was the agonizing circumstance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor Wally! She says nothing, but {{she thinks}} that I am a {{castaway}} and a recreant. I am a recreant, I know;--but yet I think that I was right. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not help myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|Eleanor was beckoning Jimmy, but {{the child}} went on. [...] "Well," [...] she said, [...] "he thinks you nice, <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> tell it {{by the way he}} looked at you. Perhaps you didn't see him, but I did." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A ---- bad job," [...] {{the other}} said, with an oath; [...] "about {{as bad as}} I ever had a hand in. Who {{would have thought that}} old cat would have held out against that? <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not have done it." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{depend on}} his memory, {{in a matter}} of this kind. It was plainly {{impossible}} that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have been intoxicated. I passed on to the second question.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hallo!" [...] said young Bingo. [...] "So you've got there? Good man! <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> rely on you. I say, old crumpet, did {{my uncle}} seem {{pleased to see}} you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It's a cure, it's a cure! <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do it. Dear sir, my grand system never failed--never. You've {{got your}} {{appetite}} back--you know you have; say {{it and make}} me happy.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I don't like it," [...] I pleaded. [...] "It hasn't got any {{interest}} for me, and art has. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do more in art," [...] and I {{reminded him that}} a successful painter gains large sums; that a picture of Meissonier's would sell for many thousand dollars.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{must try}} to think it out, and if we can't--if you can't let me give up to you unless I {{do it for the}} same reason that you do; and if I can't let you give up for me, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> neva do that; then--we mustn't!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh yes! <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{do a great}} deal. If nothing else, I could sing; {{and they}} have a great {{aptitude}} for singing, Mary was telling me. But that reminds me I must finish copying the hymn for next Sunday; Henry hindered me, and I have six copies more to do.' ...|$|E
60|$|Boy. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do it. <b>I</b> {{told you}} I'd have my dealing trick {{out of the}} priest. I took a hold of this, and Johneen made a snap at the onions.|$|R
6000|$|... "I couldn’t do that," [...] said Mrs. Cox. [...] "I couldn’t {{stand the}} disgrace, even though <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> pay him out. As it is, Cox is always setting his family above mine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' {{said the}} Queen, looking up. 'She {{wrote to me}} once from her convent; but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do nothing for her but bring her enemies' notice on her; so I made no answer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, if {{he wants}} to get any out, he'd better call in {{somebody}} to rewrite it. You don't have to engage me if you don't want to. But <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make a good job of it. There's just one little twist the thing needs and you would have quite a different piece." ...|$|E
6000|$|She smiled. [...] "You {{forget the}} time of night!" [...] Her face grew wistful. [...] "I've been getting homesick for the {{mountains}} lately--and yet I like it here. I love this beautiful room. I adore your sister. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have a delightful time if only my guides weren't so anxious to have me convert the world." ...|$|E
60|$|PHOEBE. Yes, I could. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> now. I {{wanted him}} to do it. Oh, never speak to me of others after that. Perhaps he saw I wanted it and did it to please me. But I meant--indeed I did--that I gave it to him with all my love. Sister, I could bear all the rest; but I have been unladylike.|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{tell you}} what to do about it, but I don't. It's {{possible}} there was only one man, but if so, he's dangerous. Anyhow, it's obvious that Kenwardine has no part in the matter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Excellent!" [...] said Sam. [...] "Terrific! <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> rely on you. Say no more! The whole thing's settled. You {{take her}} out rowing on the lake, and upset the boat. I plunge in ... I suppose you can swim?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Writing {{the script}} {{was much more}} enjoyable this time around because I wasn't {{constrained}} by anything. You can't write one of these movies without knowing how you're going to accomplish it. With CG at my disposal, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do whatever <b>I</b> wanted".|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can speak}} for that, ma'am," [...] said Cribb. [...] "You read the Sporting Chronicle for three weeks ago, ma'am. You'll see how he stood up to Ned Painter until his senses were beat out of him. I waited on him, ma'am, and <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> show you my {{waistcoat}} now--that would let you guess what punishment he can take." ...|$|E
6000|$|S. Come, now, the {{situation}} is full of hope, and grace, and tender sentiment. If I had in the least poetic gift, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> improvise under such an inspiration (each girl nudges her sweetheart) something worthy to--to--Is there no poet among us? (Each youth turns solemnly his back upon the other, and raises his hands in benediction over his sweetheart's bowed head.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{a strange}} apathy about him," [...] said Flora, [...] "but I believe it is chiefly for want of exertion. I should like to rouse him if papa would let me; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> by telling him how these Andersons are {{reckoning}} on his getting down. If he does, I shall be ready to run away, that I may never meet any one here again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was out," [...] Matteo said, [...] "when {{your message}} came, and only {{returned}} {{just in time}} to go to the entertainment at the ducal palace. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be of no use on board while they were only getting in the cargo." ...|$|R
60|$|More {{would have}} been too much. The thing was said. But from that time forth <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> depend upon him and that he and I were friends. It happens I never did have to depend upon him, but that does not affect our relationship.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{felt pretty}} safe. You see, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> strike the river, if necessary. At {{the same time}} you were right about the motive--in fact, there's no use in trying to hide it. I may as well confess that I'd sooner keep Gladwyne in sight." ...|$|R
