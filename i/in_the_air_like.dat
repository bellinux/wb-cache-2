25|$|Again, {{suppose it}} were like this: people-seeds drift about <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> pollen, {{and if you}} 	open your windows, one may drift in and take root in your carpets or upholstery. You don’t want children, so you fix up your windows with fine mesh screens, the very best you can buy. As can happen, however, and on very, very rare {{occasions}} does happen, one of the screens is defective; and a seed drifts in and takes root.|$|E
25|$|In the 2009 AMP Energy 500 - {{the fall}} race at Talladega, Ryan Newman was spun {{backwards}} {{at high speed}} in a late race crash, and then flipped backwards (landing upside down on Kevin Harvick's hood) and ended up on his roof. Mark Martin also barrel rolled in a crash during the same race, but instead of lifting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> Newman, his car was hit from behind, causing {{the weight of the}} car to shift to one side and pull the car onto its roof, rolling once.|$|E
60|$|His tone lingered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> almost <b>like</b> <b>the</b> tone of {{a musical}} instrument.|$|R
60|$|On the {{northern}} horizon was a finger of grey smoke, straight <b>in</b> <b>the</b> windless <b>air</b> <b>like</b> {{a point of}} admiration.|$|R
60|$|The wizard {{perceived}} that incipient rebellion was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> so, <b>like</b> a wise man, a true angekok, he trimmed his sails accordingly.|$|R
25|$|In 1827, Wheatstone {{introduced}} his 'kaleidophone', a device for rendering the vibrations of a sounding body apparent to the eye. It {{consists of a}} metal rod, carrying at its end a silvered bead, which reflects a 'spot' of light. As the rod vibrates the spot is seen to describe complicated figures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> <b>like</b> a spark whirled about in the darkness. His photometer was probably suggested by this appliance. It enables two lights to be compared by the relative brightness of their reflections in a silvered bead, which describes a narrow ellipse, so as to draw the spots into parallel lines.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, {{he began}} racing on asphalt ovals {{when he entered}} the American Speed Association (ASA) as well as {{part-time}} in the NASCAR Busch Series (now Xfinity Series). In the same year, Johnson won the ASA Pat Schauer Memorial Rookie title. One year later, he had two wins and finished third in the standings. In 2000, he was announced the driver for Herzog Motorsports in the Busch Series. During the season, he had a spectacular accident on lap 46 during the Lysol 200 at Watkins Glen when his brakes failed entering the first turn. He had to swerve quickly to the right to avoid the 86 of Dennis Demers, but went into the grass on the inside of turn one, then went back across the track, caught some air on the gravel trap before finally crashing head-on into the carafoam barriers {{at the far end of}} the turn while still more than 150+ MPH. Many feared that this accident could have resulted in career ending injuries or potentially have killed him, but he climbed out of the car unscathed and raised his fists <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> he'd won the race, much to the delight of the crowd. Otherwise, in a rather uneventful season which featured one DNQ at Daytona and 6 top-10's, he finished tenth in the point standings. During the 2001 season, Johnson recorded one win, which was at Chicagoland Speedway, and finished eighth in the point standings. He also began racing in the Winston Cup Series (now Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series) for Hendrick Motorsports. In the following season, Johnson left Herzog Motorsports to move to Hendrick Motorsports in the Winston Cup Series, driving the No. 48 Lowe's Chevrolet.|$|E
2500|$|New York City {{has been}} {{described}} as the cultural capital of the world by the diplomatic consulates of Iceland and Latvia and by New York's Baruch College. A book containing a series of essays titled New York, Culture Capital of the World, 1940–1965 has also been published as showcased by the National Library of Australia. In describing New York, author Tom Wolfe said, [...] "Culture just seems to be <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> <b>like</b> part of the weather." ...|$|E
6000|$|For {{a moment}} they both sat with their noses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> {{sniffing}} <b>like</b> hounds; then Dr. Alec sprang up, saying with great decision, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, {{come and}} fly [...] Through the sunny sky, [...] Or honey sip [...] From the rose's lip, [...] Or dance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> [...] <b>Like</b> spirits fair. [...] Come away, come away; [...] 'Tis our holiday." ...|$|R
5000|$|Peter and Brian's {{secretly}} {{taste the}} factory's Perma-Suds {{and wind up}} floating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> much <b>like</b> Charlie and Grandpa Joe did when they sampled Fizzy Lifting Drinks; while Charlie and Grandpa Joe {{are able to get}} back down by burping, Peter and Brian do so by farting.|$|R
2500|$|Magnani {{worked with}} Tennessee Williams {{again for the}} 1960 film, The Fugitive Kind (originally titled, Orpheus Descending) {{directed}} by Sidney Lumet, in which she played Lady Torrance and starred with Marlon Brando. The original screenplay Orpheus Descending was another play inspired by Magnani, although she similarly did not feature in the Broadway play. In the film she played a woman [...] "hardened by life's cruelties and a grief that will not fade." [...] It also co-starred a young Joanne Woodward {{in one of her}} early roles. In an article he wrote for Life magazine Williams discussed why he chose her for the part:"Anna and I had both cherished the dream that her appearance in the part I created for her in The Fugitive Kind would be her greatest triumph to date... She is simply a rare being who seems to have about her a little lightning-shot cloud all her own.... In a crowded room she can sit perfectly motionless and silent and still you feel the atmospheric tension of her presence, its quiver and hum <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> a live wire exposed, and a mood of Anna's is like the presence of royalty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Blackbeard," [...] he {{continued}} with a grave, puzzled manner, [...] "said that this world {{on which we}} stand floats <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> a bird, and spins round!" ...|$|E
60|$|Then she wriggled {{her fingers}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> white butterflies, shrugged her {{shoulders}} elaborately, {{rose from the}} rail, and sat down {{beside him on the}} steps, quite matter-of-factly.|$|E
60|$|On the {{previous}} night they had slept <b>in</b> <b>the</b> midst of a noisy throng who chattered and made merry until an exceedingly late hour, thus preventing the more weary from sleeping, and everywhere <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> hanging <b>like</b> clouds, was the dust raised by the feet of so many men.|$|R
60|$|It is {{an evening}} at the {{beginning}} of October, and the mellowest of autumn sunsets irradiates London, even to its uttermost eastern end. Between the eye and the flaming West, columns of smoke stand up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> still <b>air</b> <b>like</b> tall trees. Everything <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shade is rich and misty blue.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sometimes {{the whale}} shakes its {{tremendous}} tail <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> which, cracking <b>like</b> a whip, resounds to {{the distance of}} three or four miles." [...] --SCORESBY.|$|R
60|$|Before {{he could}} turn to look, the cutter seemed to be blown up by a bomb. He rose <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> a vaulter, and when he fell the light went out.|$|E
60|$|Here I thought I heard a faint sound <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> {{the hiss}} of a snake, but as it was not {{repeated}} and I could see nothing, concluded that I was mistaken.|$|E
6000|$|He struck first a heavy blow on his {{inflated}} chest: and, {{throwing out}} horizontally a big arm that remained steady, extended <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> the limb {{of a tree}} on a windless day-- ...|$|E
5000|$|Multi-stage rockets {{are much}} more complicated. They involve two or more rockets stacked {{on top of each}} other, {{designed}} to launch while <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> much <b>like</b> <b>the</b> multi-stage rockets that are used to send payloads into space. Techniques to time <b>the</b> launches <b>in</b> correct order and at the right time vary, but include the [...] "crushing-sleeve" [...] method.|$|R
60|$|I {{knew nothing}} {{of what was going}} on {{immediately}} in front of me, save that the red line, now broken by many a gap, was before my eyes; that it advanced, fell back and advanced again, sending among us such a shower of bullets that <b>the</b> buzzing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> was <b>like</b> unto a swarm of angry bees.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Spenser {{was both}} {{surprised}} and {{touched by the}} girl's look, words, and manner, and her respect much increased by the courage and good temper with which she saw her lovely castle <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> vanish <b>like</b> smoke, leaving the hard reality looking harder than ever, after this little flight into the fairy regions of romance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who--Edgar?" [...] said Melbury, abruptly. [...] "Matter? Nothing. What, my dear, {{and have}} you got home safe? Why, you are better already! But you {{ought not to be}} out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> this." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{few minutes}} passed, then, {{with a final}} scratch and {{splutter}} Joseph flung down his pen. With the sandbox tilted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> <b>like</b> a dicer about to make his throw, {{he looked at the}} lad.|$|E
6000|$|Its {{roots are}} bristling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>Like</b> some mad Earth-god's spiny hair; The loud south-wester's swell and yell Smote it at midnight, and it fell. [...] Thus ends the tree [...] Where Some One sat with me.|$|E
60|$|Outside, {{under the}} soft black foliage of the Square, beneath the slim sickle of the moon, two cats were hunting after happiness; their savage cries of passion rang <b>in</b> <b>the</b> blossom-scented <b>air</b> <b>like</b> {{a cry of}} dark {{humanity}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> jungle of dim streets. Stephen, with a shiver of disgust, for his nerves were on edge, shut the window with a slam.|$|R
5000|$|He {{directed}} and led news programs in TV and radio. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1980s, with {{the recovery of}} the democracy, LR3 Radio Belgrano put <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> renovator programs <b>like</b> [...] "Stories in Study".|$|R

6000|$|... "Why {{does the}} Lombardy poplar hold its {{branches}} straight up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> that, {{when all the}} other poplars hold theirs out or hang them down?" [...] interjected Peter, who had been gazing intently at the slender spire showing darkly against the fine blue eastern sky.|$|E
60|$|The {{strong breeze}} from astern now filling the ill-set sails, they bellied, and rocked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> <b>like</b> balloons, while, from the novel strain upon it, every spar quivered and sprung.

6000|$|... "They were a {{lot more}} nervous than we were, at the last. They sent up enough light at night from their trenches--you know, those things that burst <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> {{electric}} light--we had none of that to do--they did it all for us--lit up everything. They were more nervous than we were...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Carvel," [...] said Mr. Dulany to my grandfather, [...] "I would {{strongly}} counsel {{you to take}} Richard {{from that}} school. Pernicious doctrines, sir, are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> and <b>like</b> diseases are early caught by the young.

50|$|Colonel <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Indian Army is {{equivalent}} to captain <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Indian Navy and group captain <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Indian <b>Air</b> Force. <b>Like</b> other armies, this rank is higher than Lieutenant Colonel and lower than a Brigadier.|$|R
60|$|As the redcoats {{steadily}} retired, keeping behind {{cover as}} much as possible, the enemy followed them up with yells of exultation, springing from rock to rock, waving their jezails <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> and howling <b>like</b> a pack of demons.|$|R
