5|$|A mixed <b>inhibitor</b> binds to an {{allosteric}} {{site and the}} binding of the substrate and the <b>inhibitor</b> affect each other. The enzyme's function is reduced but not eliminated when bound to the <b>inhibitor.</b> This type of <b>inhibitor</b> does not follow the Michaelis-Menten equation.|$|E
5|$|An uncompetitive <b>inhibitor</b> cannot bind to {{the free}} enzyme, only to the enzyme-substrate complex; hence, these types of inhibitors are most {{effective}} at high substrate concentration. In {{the presence of the}} <b>inhibitor,</b> the enzyme-substrate complex is inactive. This type of inhibition is rare.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme inhibitors are {{molecules}} that reduce or abolish enzyme activity, while enzyme activators are {{molecules that}} increase the catalytic rate of enzymes. These interactions can be either reversible (i.e., removal of the <b>inhibitor</b> restores enzyme activity) or irreversible (i.e., the <b>inhibitor</b> permanently inactivates the enzyme).|$|E
50|$|Some {{examples}} of exopeptidase <b>inhibitors</b> include amastatin, bestatin (ubenimex), puromycin, 1,10-phenanthroline, D-phenylalanine, ACE <b>inhibitors,</b> DPP-4 <b>inhibitors,</b> and exogenous MMP <b>inhibitors</b> like batimastat and marimastat. Various enkephalinase <b>inhibitors,</b> such as ketalorphan, spinorphin, and tynorphin, are mainly exopeptidase <b>inhibitors.</b>|$|R
40|$|Depending on {{the stage}} of their {{intervention}} with the viral replicative cycle, human immunodeficiency virus <b>inhibitors</b> could be divided into the following groups: (i) adsorption <b>inhibitors</b> (i. e., CD 4 constructs, polysulfates, polysulfonates, polycarboxylates, and polyoxometalates), (ii) fusion <b>inhibitors</b> (i. e., plant lectins, succinylated or aconitylated albumins, and betulinic acid derivatives), (iii) uncoating <b>inhibitors</b> (i. e., bicyclams), (iv) reverse transcription <b>inhibitors</b> acting either competitively with the substrate binding site (i. e., dideoxynucleoside analogs and acyclic nucleoside phosphonates) or allosterically with a nonsubstrate binding site (i. e., non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase <b>inhibitors),</b> (v) integration <b>inhibitors,</b> (vi) DNA replication <b>inhibitors,</b> (vii) transcription <b>inhibitors</b> (i. e., antisense oligodeoxynucleotides and Tat antagonists), (viii) translation <b>inhibitors</b> (i. e., antisense oligodeoxynucleotides and ribozymes), (ix) maturation <b>inhibitors</b> (i. e., protease <b>inhibitors,</b> myristoylation <b>inhibitors,</b> and glycosylation <b>inhibitors),</b> and finally, (x) budding (assembly/release) <b>inhibitors.</b> Current knowledge, including the therapeutic potential, of these various <b>inhibitors</b> is discussed.

5|$|In {{competitive}} inhibition, {{the substrate}} and <b>inhibitor</b> cannot bind to the enzyme {{at the same}} time, {{as shown in the}} figure on the right. This usually results from the <b>inhibitor</b> having an affinity for the active site of an enzyme where the substrate also binds; the substrate and <b>inhibitor</b> compete for access to the enzyme's active site. This type of inhibition can be overcome by sufficiently high concentrations of substrate (Vmax remains constant), i.e., by out-competing the <b>inhibitor.</b> However, the apparent Km will increase as it takes a higher concentration of the substrate to reach the Km point, or half the Vmax. Competitive inhibitors are often similar in structure to the real substrate (see examples below).|$|E
5|$|In mixed {{inhibition}}, the <b>inhibitor</b> {{can bind to}} {{the enzyme}} {{at the same time}} as the enzyme's substrate. However, the binding of the <b>inhibitor</b> affects the binding of the substrate, and vice versa. This type of inhibition can be reduced, but not overcome by increasing concentrations of substrate. Although it is possible for mixed-type inhibitors to bind in the active site, this type of inhibition generally results from an allosteric effect where the <b>inhibitor</b> binds to a different site on an enzyme. <b>Inhibitor</b> binding to this allosteric site changes the conformation (i.e., tertiary structure or three-dimensional shape) of the enzyme so that the affinity of the substrate for the active site is reduced.|$|E
30|$|Interface <b>inhibitors</b> {{can further}} be {{classified}} into two subtypes, i.e. liquid-phase <b>inhibitors</b> and vapor-phase <b>inhibitors.</b> Liquid-phase <b>inhibitors</b> are those <b>inhibitors</b> that are categorized {{on the basis}} of their electrochemical reactions [58]. Vapor-phase <b>inhibitors</b> are temporary <b>inhibitors</b> which are used to prevent corrosion; especially in closed environments. They are environment-friendly and do not contain any harmful chemicals such as nitrates. They also have low cost, are easily affordable and last for long time thus yielding reliable results [58, 59, 60].|$|R
50|$|SSRIs form a {{subclass}} of serotonin uptake <b>inhibitors,</b> {{which includes}} other non-selective <b>inhibitors</b> as well. The serotonergic serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake <b>inhibitors</b> and serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake <b>inhibitors</b> are also commonly used as antidepressants.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{important}} to note that while all non-competitive <b>inhibitors</b> bind the enzyme at allosteric sites (i.e. locations other than its active site)â€”not all <b>inhibitors</b> that bind at allosteric sites are non-competitive <b>inhibitors.</b> [...] In fact, allosteric <b>inhibitors</b> may act as competitive, non-competitive, or uncompetitive <b>inhibitors.</b>|$|R
5|$|More recently, an {{alternative}} approach has been applied: rational drug design uses the three-dimensional structure of an enzyme's active site to predict which molecules might be inhibitors. These predictions are then tested and one of these tested compounds may be a novel <b>inhibitor.</b> This new <b>inhibitor</b> is then {{used to try to}} obtain a structure of the enzyme in an inhibitor/enzyme complex to show how the molecule is binding to the active site, allowing changes to be made to the <b>inhibitor</b> to try to optimise binding. This test and improve cycle is then repeated until a sufficiently potent <b>inhibitor</b> is produced. Computer-based methods of predicting the affinity of an <b>inhibitor</b> for an enzyme are also being developed, such as molecular docking and molecular mechanics.|$|E
5|$|Physiological enzyme {{inhibition}} {{can also be}} produced by specific protein inhibitors. This mechanism occurs in the pancreas, which synthesises many digestive precursor enzymes known as zymogens. Many of these are activated by the trypsin protease, so {{it is important to}} inhibit the activity of trypsin in the pancreas to prevent the organ from digesting itself. One way in which the activity of trypsin is controlled is the production of a specific and potent trypsin <b>inhibitor</b> protein in the pancreas. This <b>inhibitor</b> binds tightly to trypsin, preventing the trypsin activity that would otherwise be detrimental to the organ. Although the trypsin <b>inhibitor</b> is a protein, it avoids being hydrolysed as a substrate by the protease by excluding water from trypsin's active site and destabilising the transition state. Other examples of physiological enzyme <b>inhibitor</b> proteins include the barstar <b>inhibitor</b> of the bacterial ribonuclease barnase and the inhibitors of protein phosphatases.|$|E
5|$|Serotonin {{syndrome}} is typically {{caused by the}} use of two or more serotonergic medications or drugs. This may include selective serotonin reuptake <b>inhibitor</b> (SSRI), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake <b>inhibitor</b> (SNRI), monoamine oxidase <b>inhibitor</b> (MAOI), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), amphetamines, pethidine (meperidine), tramadol, dextromethorphan, buspirone, L-tryptophan, 5-HTP, St. John's wort, triptans, ecstasy (MDMA), metoclopramide, ondansetron, or cocaine. It occurs in about 15% of SSRI overdoses. It is a predictable consequence of excess serotonin on the central nervous system (CNS). Onset of symptoms is typically within a day of the extra serotonin.|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} of a large variety of new compounds and new strategies {{for the treatment of}} virtually all major virus infections has been addressed. This includes, for the treatment of HIV infections, virus adsorption <b>inhibitors</b> (cosalane derivatives, cyanovirin-N), co-receptor antagonists (TAK- 779, AMD 3100), viral fusion <b>inhibitors</b> (pentafuside T- 20, betulinic acid derivatives), viral uncoating <b>inhibitors</b> (azodicarbonamide), nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase <b>inhibitors</b> (NRTIs: emtricitabine, amdoxovir, dOTC, d 4 TMP prodrugs, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase <b>inhibitors</b> (NNRTIs: thiocarboxanilide UC- 781, capravirine, SJ- 3366, DPC 083, TMC 125 /R 165335), integrase <b>inhibitors</b> (diketo acids), transcription <b>inhibitors</b> (temacrazine, flavopiridol), protease <b>inhibitors</b> (atazanavir, mozenavir, tipranavir); for the treatment of RSV and paramyxovirus infections, viral fusion <b>inhibitors</b> (R 170591, VP- 14637, NMS 03); for the treatment of picornavirus infections, viral uncoating <b>inhibitors</b> (pleconaril); for the treatment of pesti- (hepaci-, flavi-) virus infections, RNA replicase <b>inhibitors</b> (VP- 32947); for the treatment of herpesvirus (HSV, VZV, CMV) infections, DNA polymerase <b>inhibitors</b> (A- 5021, L- and D-cyclohexenylguanine); for the treatment of VZV infections, bicyclic furopyrimidine analogues; for the treatment of CMV infections, fomivirsen; for the treatment of DNA virus infections at large (papilloma-, polyoma-, herpes-, adeno- and poxvirus infections), cidofovir; for the treatment of influenza, neuraminidase <b>inhibitors</b> (zanamivir, oseltamivir, RWJ- 270201); for the treatment of HBV infections, adefovir dipivoxil; for the treatment of HBV and HCV infections, N-glycosylation <b>inhibitors</b> (N-nonyl-deoxynojirimycin); and, finally, IMP dehydrogenase <b>inhibitors</b> and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase <b>inhibitors,</b> for the treatment of various virus infections, including hemorrhagic fever virus infections. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT- Proteinase <b>inhibitors</b> are {{proteins}} {{widely distributed}} in plants. Among these, the serine proteinase <b>inhibitors,</b> of which trypsin <b>inhibitors</b> {{are the most}} studied, are thought {{to participate in the}} array of defensive substances that plants synthesize for protection against pest and pathogens. Cysteine proteinase <b>inhibitors,</b> of which papain <b>inhibitors</b> are the most well known, have been recently associated, on the other hand, with the control of protein mobilization. In this review I discuss recent findings that favor these views. Additional index terms: trypsin <b>inhibitors,</b> papain <b>inhibitors,</b> seeds, defense proteins...|$|R
5|$|The binding and {{inactivation}} {{steps of}} this reaction are investigated by incubating the enzyme with <b>inhibitor</b> and assaying {{the amount of}} activity remaining over time. The activity will be decreased in a time-dependent manner, usually following exponential decay. Fitting these data to a rate equation gives the rate of inactivation at this concentration of <b>inhibitor.</b> This is done at several different concentrations of <b>inhibitor.</b> If a reversible EI complex is involved the inactivation rate will be saturable and fitting this curve will give kinact and Ki.|$|E
5|$|Thus, in the {{presence}} of the <b>inhibitor,</b> the enzyme's effective Km and Vmax become (Î±/Î±')Km and (1/Î±')Vmax, respectively. However, the modified Michaelis-Menten equation assumes that binding of the <b>inhibitor</b> to the enzyme has reached equilibrium, which may be a very slow process for inhibitors with sub-nanomolar dissociation constants. In these cases, it is usually more practical to treat the tight-binding <b>inhibitor</b> as an irreversible <b>inhibitor</b> (see below); however, it can still be possible to estimate Ki' kinetically if Ki is measured independently.|$|E
5|$|A {{competitive}} <b>inhibitor</b> and substrate cannot bind to {{the enzyme}} {{at the same}} time. Often competitive inhibitors strongly resemble the real substrate of the enzyme. For example, the drug methotrexate is a competitive <b>inhibitor</b> of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, which catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. The similarity between the structures of dihydrofolate and this drug are shown in the accompanying figure. This type of inhibition can be overcome with high substrate concentration. In some cases, the <b>inhibitor</b> can bind to a site other than the binding-site of the usual substrate and exert an allosteric effect to change {{the shape of the}} usual binding-site.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of new antiretroviral drugs is a dynamic process that is continuously fueled by identification of new molecular targets and new compounds for know targets. The current available drugs can be classified into five categories: nucleoside analogues reverse transcriptase <b>inhibitors,</b> non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase <b>inhibitors,</b> protease <b>inhibitors,</b> integrase <b>inhibitors</b> and entry <b>inhibitors</b> (fusion <b>inhibitors</b> and CCR 5 antagonist). In addition, the maturation <b>inhibitors</b> may be considered as potential target for chemotherapeutic intervention.

5000|$|These <b>inhibitors</b> {{chemically}} retard {{the formation}} of clathrate hydrates. Dosage of such <b>inhibitors</b> in the fluid is usually [...]3% to [...]5% by weight of the fluid, compared to 10% to 50% by weight for thermodynamic <b>inhibitors</b> for prevention of clathrate formation. Due to this and other factors, kinetic <b>inhibitors</b> are more cost effective than thermodynamic <b>inhibitors.</b> However, if the fluid is in a static environment (i.e. packer fluid), kinetic <b>inhibitors</b> will have limited effect as hydrates will still form over sufficient time. At this point the only viable option is thermodynamic <b>inhibitors.</b>|$|R
25|$|Other {{agents that}} are under {{investigation}} include nucleoside and nucleotide analogue <b>inhibitors</b> and non nucleoside <b>inhibitors</b> of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase, <b>inhibitors</b> of nonstructural protein 5A and host targeted compounds such as cyclophilin <b>inhibitors</b> and silibinin.|$|R
5|$|A non-competitive <b>inhibitor</b> binds {{to a site}} {{other than}} where the {{substrate}} binds. The substrate still binds with its usual affinity and hence Km remains the same. However the <b>inhibitor</b> reduces the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme so that Vmax is reduced. In contrast to competitive inhibition, non-competitive inhibition cannot be overcome with high substrate concentration.|$|E
5|$|Although many natural toxins are {{secondary}} metabolites, these poisons {{also include}} peptides and proteins. An {{example of a}} toxic peptide is alpha-amanitin, which is found in relatives of the death cap mushroom. This is a potent enzyme <b>inhibitor,</b> in this case preventing the RNA polymerase II enzyme from transcribing DNA. The algal toxin microcystin is also a peptide and is an <b>inhibitor</b> of protein phosphatases. This toxin can contaminate water supplies after algal blooms and is a known carcinogen that can also cause acute liver hemorrhage and death at higher doses.|$|E
5|$|Although {{many of the}} afore-mentioned inhibitors {{share the}} same Hsp90 binding site (either N- or C-terminal), {{it has been shown}} that some of these drugs {{preferentially}} access distinct Hsp90 populations, which are differentiated by the extent of their post-translational modification. Though no published <b>inhibitor</b> has yet to distinguish between Hsp90A and Hsp90B, a recent study has shown that phosphorylation of a particular residue in the Hsp90 N-terminus can provide isoform specificity to <b>inhibitor</b> binding., thus providing an additional level of regulation for optimal Hsp90 targeting.|$|E
5000|$|Serine proteases are {{inhibited}} by {{a diverse}} group of <b>inhibitors,</b> including synthetic chemical <b>inhibitors</b> for research or therapeutic purposes, and also natural proteinaceous <b>inhibitors.</b> One family of natural <b>inhibitors</b> called [...] "serpins" [...] (abbreviated from serine protease <b>inhibitors)</b> can form a covalent bond with the serine protease, inhibiting its function. The best-studied serpins are antithrombin and alpha 1-antitrypsin, studied for their role in coagulation/thrombosis and emphysema/A1AT, respectively.Artificial irreversible small molecule <b>inhibitors</b> include AEBSF and PMSF.|$|R
50|$|Many {{tyrosinase}} <b>inhibitors</b> {{have been}} discovered or developed. Very many <b>inhibitors</b> of tyrosinase are known; most are of the reversible type.

5|$|An {{example of}} a {{medicinal}} enzyme <b>inhibitor</b> is sildenafil (Viagra), a common treatment for male erectile dysfunction. This compound is a potent <b>inhibitor</b> of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5, the enzyme that degrades the signalling molecule cyclic guanosine monophosphate. This signalling molecule triggers smooth muscle relaxation and allows blood flow into the corpus cavernosum, which causes an erection. Since the drug decreases {{the activity of the}} enzyme that halts the signal, it makes this signal last {{for a longer period of}} time.|$|E
5|$|An {{irreversible}} <b>inhibitor</b> permanently inactivates the enzyme, {{usually by}} forming a covalent bond to the protein. Penicillin and aspirin are common drugs that act in this manner.|$|E
5|$|Another {{method that}} {{is widely used}} in these {{analyses}} is mass spectrometry. Here, accurate measurement {{of the mass of}} the unmodified native enzyme and the inactivated enzyme gives the increase in mass caused by reaction with the <b>inhibitor</b> and shows the stoichiometry of the reaction. This is usually done using a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. In a complementary technique, peptide mass fingerprinting involves digestion of the native and modified protein with a protease such as trypsin. This will produce a set of peptides that can be analysed using a mass spectrometer. The peptide that changes in mass after reaction with the <b>inhibitor</b> will be the one that contains the site of modification.|$|E
30|$|Mixed <b>inhibitors</b> {{can also}} be {{classified}} into two subtypes that are physical and chemical <b>inhibitors.</b> Physical <b>inhibitors</b> {{are those that are}} adsorbed physically and interact rapidly; however, a major disadvantage about them is that they also get removed easily. In chemical <b>inhibitors,</b> as there is a chemical reaction involved, it slows down the process in comparison with physical <b>inhibitors</b> [58].|$|R
50|$|Amylase <b>inhibitors</b> {{prevent the}} action of enzymes that break the glycosidic bonds of {{starches}} and other complex carbohydrates, preventing the release of simple sugars and absorption by the body.

Amylase <b>inhibitors</b> are present in many types of beans; commercially available amylase <b>inhibitors</b> are extracted from white kidney beans.|$|R
50|$|During tumor growth, {{the action}} of {{angiogenesis}} stimulators surpasses the control of angiogenesis <b>inhibitors,</b> allowing for unregulated or less regulated blood vessel growth and formation. Endogenous <b>inhibitors</b> are attractive targets for cancer therapy because they are less toxic {{and less likely to}} lead to drug resistance than some exogenous <b>inhibitors.</b> However, the therapeutic use of endogenous <b>inhibitors</b> has disadvantages. In animal studies, high doses of <b>inhibitors</b> were required to prevent tumor growth and the use of endogenous <b>inhibitors</b> would likely be long-term.|$|R
