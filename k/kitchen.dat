5|$|As {{the glaciers}} {{retreated to the}} {{northeast}} about 20,000 years ago, glacial lakes formed. Drainage from the melting glacier and lakes cut a sluiceway, or channel, that diverted the headwaters of South Branch Bowman Creek into the Glen Leigh branch of <b>Kitchen</b> Creek. The retreating glaciers also left deposits of debris 20to 30feet (6.1to 9.1m) thick, which formed a dam blocking water from draining into Big Run. Instead water from Ganoga Lake and the area that later became Lake Jean was diverted into the Ganoga Glen branch of <b>Kitchen</b> Creek. These diversions added about 7square miles (18km²) to the <b>Kitchen</b> Creek drainage basin, increasing it by just over 50percent to 20.1square miles (52km²).|$|E

5|$|On {{the second}} floor is the hall, with a <b>kitchen</b> occupying the jamb, and later {{passages}} connecting {{to the east and}} west ranges. The hall has a large carved stone fireplace of around 1500, and once had a timber ceiling, probably painted. The <b>kitchen</b> was replaced by a larger one in the 16th-century east range, and converted into a bedroom. A smaller fireplace was inserted into the large <b>kitchen</b> hearth, and larger windows added. The next storey, accessed via a spiral stair, contained a windowless room in the vault above the hall ceiling. Above the <b>kitchen</b> is the lord's bedroom, the only original private chamber in the building. The stairs continue to give access to parapet walks around the stone-flagged roof. A further storey was added to the jamb in the sixteenth century, containing a single chamber. The exterior of the castle formerly had two timber balconies, or viewing platforms, one overlooking the gardens to the south, and one looking east across the Lothian countryside.|$|E

The prosecution alleged that the marks had been made during the struggle in the <b>kitchen</b> between Bamber and his father, as the silencer, attached to the rifle, had scratched against the mantelpiece.

5|$|The {{result was}} {{increased}} water flow in <b>Kitchen</b> Creek, {{which has been}} cutting the falls in the glens since. The gradient or slope of <b>Kitchen</b> Creek was fairly stable for its flow when it had a much smaller drainage basin, as Phillips Creek still does. The increased basin size means that <b>Kitchen</b> Creek in the glens is too steep for its present amount of water flow. As <b>Kitchen</b> Creek continues to cut into the rock and erode it up the Allegheny Front, the creek's slope will decrease and become less steep. In the future, the creek's flow and slope are predicted to become {{similar to those of}} other nearby creeks with similar size drainage basins. This process could take so long that a new glacial period might occur before the transformation is complete.|$|E
