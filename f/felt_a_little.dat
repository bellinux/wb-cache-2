25|$|On September 16, 2006, Telemundo debuted {{a weekend}} morning block aimed at younger {{children}} {{as part of}} the Qubo endeavor, which was formed through a partnership between NBC Universal, Ion Media Networks, Teletoon, Nelvana, Scholastic Media, Classic Media and its subsidiary Big Idea Productions. It <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit similar to the Telemundo Kids block since Jacob Two-Two also aired on the Qubo block. The Qubo block featured Spanish dubs of programs seen on its companion blocks on NBC, Ion Television, and its companion 24/7 network (alternatively known as Qubo Channel), with Telemundo's Qubo block airing on Saturday and Sunday mornings in 90-minute blocks.|$|E
25|$|From {{that point}} on {{he took over the}} story. He told us that {{in the early part of}} his career he had taken special {{training}} on spotting and tracing torpedo wakes and that was one of the reasons he <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> safer when he was on the bridge in treacherous waters. As a result of his early training he was the first one to see the wakes of the two torpedoes coming from the port side. Both torpedoes went between the Helena and the San Francisco and when both ships turned, the torpedoes went past us and one of them hit the Juneau. We were not able to warn the Juneau in time to save her.|$|E

I was caught {{out like a}} lot of artists were, with record companies figuring out how to do single releases these days. I remember doing a promo for one of the last singles and it just felt really old-fashioned. I'm pretty computer-savvy, something didn't feel right, but no one said anything to me. You get Britney releasing [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] and Gaga's [...] "Born This Way" [...] available on iTunes the day you hear it first. That's how it should be. And there's me waiting for a mid-week chart figure like it's 1989." ...|$|E

500|$|There are two {{versions}} of the story of how Lennon and Ono first met. [...] According to the first account, on November 9, 1966 Lennon went to the Indica Gallery in London, where Ono was preparing her conceptual art exhibit, and they were introduced by gallery owner John Dunbar. Lennon was initially unimpressed with the exhibits he saw, including a pricey bag of nails, but one piece had a ladder with a spyglass at the top. [...] When he climbed the ladder, Lennon <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> foolish, but he looked through the spyglass and saw the word [...] "YES" [...] which he said meant he didn't walk out, as it was positive, whereas most concept art he encountered was [...] "anti" [...] everything.|$|E
500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{wrote in}} his review for the episode, [...] ""The Broken Man" [...] gave us back The Hound, but his return <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> diminished, given the parade of returns we've already seen this year, and there weren't as many notable moments in this chapter as other Game of Thrones episodes. There were some fine scenes, but nothing on par with the show's usual goods, though Lady Mormont was a {{highlight}} and Jaime and the Blackfish's standoff is an interesting scenario, {{not to mention the}} questions raised by Sansa's letter. Arya getting her guts punctured was a shocker, but it didn’t feel right that she couldn't see her attacker coming." [...] He gave the episode an 8 out of 10.|$|E
500|$|On {{his first}} day for filming series three, Penry-Jones participated in a fight scene {{in the middle of}} the first episode. He <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> wary {{replacing}} Matthew Macfadyen. After two months of filming, Penry-Jones began to feel more at ease with the role. He felt especially so after he started working for the fourth series. He returned to the fourth series because he thought his character took off by the end of the last series, and wanted to see which direction he would go to next. The crew wanted Adam to go from a [...] "happy-go-lucky" [...] figure to wanting him to deal with things that would make it hard for Adam to be jokey towards the end of the fourth series; this involved Fiona's death.|$|E

500|$|Clifford was {{irritated by}} being placed within a genre by critics, stating that Seefeel [...] "weren't {{trying to fit}} into any one of their scenes and it <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> like we were almost having {{convention}} thrust upon us when that was the very thing we were reacting against." [...] AllMusic compared the songs to ambient music by the Aphex Twin, while Exclaim! noted that [...] "Quique follows a similar path as Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient work but with structures that a more rock-based band like Chapterhouse dreamed of matching." [...] The members of Seefeel were fans of Aphex Twin and said after playing shows with him and Autechre that they felt [...] "more affinity with them {{than many of the}} bands we'd met – Robin Guthrie and the Cocteau Twins excepted!" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Party" [...] was {{directed}} by Beyoncé and Alan Ferguson. As reported by Rap-Up, Beyoncé filmed the clip in the Oakdale Mobile Home Park in South Brunswick Township, New Jersey, on August 2, 2011. The video shoot called for multiple flashy fashions, a red muscle car, and colorfully dressed dancers. Solange Knowles, Beyoncé's younger sister, and Kelly Rowland, former Destiny's Child member, both made cameos. Rowland elaborated a bit about {{her role in the}} video in an interview with NeonLimelight: [...] "I'm just doing a cameo. We just had a really good time [...] While filming the video, we noticed that we were doing certain stuff that we used to do as kids. We kinda <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> goofy for a second, so we stopped. But we just had a good time.". Model Shaun Ross also makes a cameo in the video.|$|E
500|$|IGN's Brian Zoromski rated [...] "The Merger" [...] 9 out of 10, an {{indication}} of an [...] "amazing" [...] episode. He called the opening sequence [...] "arguably the funniest" [...] scene, and believed [...] "Andy's proven to be an even better source of hilarity than he ever was in the Stamford office." [...] Zoromski was unhappy however with the [...] "outright product placement [...] " [...] with Staples, writing that [...] "the show's quality <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> compromised. It's one thing to see blatant product placement in a reality show like Survivor or American Idol but when it invades a great scripted comedy… well, it kinda drags the show down to the reality level." [...] Doug Elfman of the Chicago Sun-Times thought the episode was [...] "funnier than it's been in a while," [...] praising Kelly but criticizing the [...] "fat-guy joke." [...] Elfman cited Michael and Andy's new relationship as a positive element. Television Without Pity graded the episode with an A+.|$|E

500|$|Many of {{the band}} members have {{expressed}} their dissatisfaction with All Hope Is Gone and {{is considered to be}} their least favorite Slipknot album. Feeling discontent over the record's production process, Root said, [...] "it <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit rushed. And it felt like we were trying to do things just to appease a schedule, which I didn't really like." [...] Root was particularly disappointed with the record's producer, Dave Fortman, and said, [...] "Dave Fortman really helped me appreciate Rick Rubin as a producer. [...] wasn't able to get nine people together on the same page and, to me, that's {{the most important thing in}} making a Slipknot record." [...] Conversely, Jordison said, [...] "It's finally the record that I've wanted Slipknot to sound like." [...] He went on to compliment Fortman's ear for tone, and considered All Hope Is Gone to be the band's best album. All Hope Is Gone was mixed by Colin Richardson in Miloco's The Engine Room studio in the United Kingdom.|$|E
500|$|Emerson saw a kindred {{spirit in}} Very and defended his sanity. As {{he wrote to}} Margaret Fuller, [...] "Such a mind cannot be lost". Emerson was {{sympathetic}} with Very's plight because he himself had recently been ostracized after his controversial lecture, the [...] "Divinity School Address". He helped Very publish a small volume, Essays and Poems in 1839. The poems collected in this volume were chiefly Shakespearean sonnets. Very also published several poems in the Western Messenger between 1838 and 1840 {{as well as in}} The Dial, the journal of the Transcendentalists. He was disappointed, however, that Emerson, serving as editor of the journal, altered his poems. Very wrote to Emerson in July 1842, [...] "Perhaps they were all improvements but I preferred my own lines. I do not know but I ought to submit to such changes as done by the rightful authority of an Editor but I <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sad at the aspect of the piece." [...] He was never widely read, and was largely forgotten {{by the end of the}} nineteenth century, but in the 1830s and 1840s the Transcendentalists, including Emerson, as well as William Cullen Bryant, praised his work.|$|E
500|$|Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B" [...] and wrote that [...] "there is no {{question}} that [...] is a fan service." [...] He called it a [...] "mixed bag"; on one hand, he noted that some of the scenes were clever, such as Darryl's opinion on portraying a black president before Obama was elected. On the other hand, however, he felt that Michael's [...] "juvenile" [...] response to Holly was uncharacteristic, and the [...] "oddly high production values and camera work" [...] were unrealistic for the show. He also felt the inclusion of some characters—such as Roy, Jan, or Karen—did not make sense {{in the context of the}} series. He concluded, however, that while the episode had issues, [...] "the actual content of Threat Level Midnight was successful in more ways than I had expected". Rick Porter of Zap2it gave the episode a more mixed review, saying that it [...] "had moments that were a huge amount of fun, both inside Michael's labor of love and in people's reaction to it. But it also <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit clip-showy." ...|$|E
60|$|Miss Wilkinson {{oddly enough}} had {{suggested}} that they should read Romeo and Juliet together; but Philip had firmly declined.

60|$|So Frank {{had married}} a Roman Catholic lady, and an heir was expected, and Mr. Esmond was to carry this {{intelligence}} to his mistress at London. 'Twas a difficult embassy; and the Colonel <b>felt</b> not <b>a</b> <b>little</b> tremor as he neared the capital.|$|R
60|$|But he <b>felt,</b> later, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> compunction. He {{had been}} violent, cruel with poor Hermione. He wanted to recompense her, {{to make it}} up. He had hurt her, he had been vindictive. He {{wanted to be on}} good terms with her again.|$|R
500|$|The {{repercussions of}} the {{euthanasia}} for Dot's character {{have been described}} as [...] "extremely serious" [...] as she suffered from [...] "untold guilt and felt that she needed to be punished for the action." [...] The Executive Producer overseeing this storyline, John Yorke, has discussed the storyline in a speech given at the Bishops' Conference for clergy and other ministers in the Diocese of St Albans: [...] "Dot, as a good Christian, refused to help, until her love for her friend overcame her own fear of damnation. Riddled with an intolerable burden of guilt, she felt there was only one person she could talk to [...] The Dot and Ethel storyline played out in over four months with many similar scenes, to an average audience of 16 million viewers. Dot [...] explored the full panoply of religious belief before coming back to terms with her maker. When Alan Bookbinder took over as head of religious broadcasting at the BBC he described EastEnders for the weeks the Dot and Ethel story ran as 'the best religious programme on television' and compared [...] to Graham Greene. While we <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> uncomfortable in such exalted company, what it did show is that handled properly an audience is able to engage in, and relate to profound ethical debate." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} of the episode was not entirely favorable. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club noted a general decline in the show's quality in the fourth season, and after a return to form in its previous episode, [...] "Dealbreakers Talk Show #0001", he found [...] "Secret Santa" [...] disappointing, {{and gave it a}} grade B. [...] "It was cute and nicely plotted", he wrote [...] "but it <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> rote and familiar." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning was more positively inclined. He appreciated Julianne Moore's appearance, but he found that some of the story lines, [...] "though sprinkled with funny moments, were more successful as sweet tales made for the holiday." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad was glad to see Cheyenne Jackson's Danny back on 30 Rock, and noted that the plots concerning Jack and Nancy and Kenneth and the TGS writers, respectively, were [...] "home runs". He liked that Tina Fey's character Liz [...] "was more of a supporting player" [...] in [...] "Secret Santa". Sassone also enjoyed Moore's appearance on the show, commenting that she was [...] "wicked good" [...] as Jack's new love interest. Entertainment Weeklys Margaret Lyons wrote that this episode [...] "had some awesome Liz/Jack moments, a nice little storyline for Pete and Danny, and the invention of a whole new pizza-loving religion." ...|$|E
500|$|Henrik Batallones of BuddyTV deemed [...] "Funk" [...] {{a bridge}} between [...] "Theatricality" [...] and the season finale, writing: [...] "It feels like the episode got itself in a funk, and when things get close to being awesome, it pulls back." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN rated the episode 6.8/10 for [...] "Passable", but deemed it the weakest episode of Glee thus far, while Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times called it [...] "just one big funked-up mess." [...] Broadway World Mary Hanrahan felt that: [...] "While [...] "Funk" [...] had some redeeming, even charming, moments, it did nothing {{to make up for}} the perplexing episode that preceded it and {{ultimately}} left much to be desired." [...] In contrast, Aly Semigran of MTV had enjoyed the preceding episode, yet still received [...] "Funk" [...] poorly, calling it: [...] "a step down from last week's strong 'Theatricality'." [...] As with Respers France, Semigran noted that Quinn's performance" [...] <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> uncomfortable and borderline 'offensive'." [...] In contrast, Raymund Flandez of the Wall Street Journal enjoyed Quinn's song, which he called a [...] "magnificent surprise", praising the [...] "perfect jazzy–funk choreography". Flandez criticized the [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] performance, however, deeming it a [...] "song so bad it can't be saved by irony or nostalgia", and felt that [...] "Give Up the Funk" [...] was [...] "underdeveloped" [...] asking: [...] "Where's the soul? Anger? Passion? Emotion? Isn't that what this was supposed to be about?" ...|$|E
60|$|We all heartily {{agreed with}} the missionary in this sentiment, and <b>felt</b> not <b>a</b> <b>little</b> gratified {{to find that the}} {{opinions}} which Jack and I had been led to form, from personal observation on our Coral Island, were thus to a great extent corroborated.|$|R
60|$|Lord Everingham <b>felt</b> not <b>a</b> <b>little</b> perplexed. The Cardinal seemed bent on {{pressing}} his point, and on obtaining a definite promise of friendship, whilst {{the young man}} {{would have preferred to}} leave the matter in statu quo, a condition of open and avowed enmity.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it so wonderful?" [...] she answered. [...] "To {{tell you}} the truth, I was not sleepy, and I <b>felt</b> like <b>a</b> <b>little</b> walk. You can go back now, Bryan," [...] she said, turning to her maid. [...] "Mr. Mannering will see me home." ...|$|R
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed critical reviews, with [...] "Tweenlight" [...] generally being {{regarded as}} the best segment. John Griffiths of Us Weekly gave the episode three stars, writing that [...] "the three oddball tales run from mildly amusing to flat-out inspired. In one goofy vignette, Homer and a bikini-wearing Marge pluck a scary mystery man from the sea. However, watching Lisa crush on a brooding vampire in a dead-on poke at Twilight is the hilarious treat here." [...] Fred Topel of Screen Junkies wrote, [...] "The best jokes in all the segments are actually not the spoofs. They’re the cartoon physical comedy, the references to mundane frustrations like having to be the thimble when playing Monopoly. It’s also super gory. [...] I think “The Simpsons” {{are still on the}} creative upswing since The Simpsons Movie and this “Treehouse of Horrors” would hold up with classics like [...] "The Shinning" [...] and [...] "The Homega Man." [...] Brad Trechak of TV Squad felt {{that it was one of}} the best Treehouse of Horrors in years. He wrote, [...] "Of the three vignettes, the first segment 'War and Pieces,' while not the best, was the most original despite being a variation of the plot of 'Jumanji.' Unlike that book/movie, instead of the game coming into the real world, the game brings other board games into the real world. The satire on this show remains sharp as none of the games had the same name as their real world counterparts to prevent toy company litigation against Fox. [...] The final segment 'Tweenlight'... was the best of the three. It <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> less dated than the first two." ...|$|E
500|$|Mercedes {{featured}} {{in three of}} the episode's musical numbers. Flandez said of her solo, [...] "She blew Jennifer Hudson's 'Spotlight' out of this world." [...] Benigno wrote that it was [...] "great", but added that it was [...] "not much of a stretch for Amber Riley to hit this one". Berk praised her [...] "amazing voice" [...] and gave the performance four stars out of five, and Goldberg characterized the rendition as [...] "flawless". Other reviewers were more critical, including VanDerWerff, who said that this was the only song in the episode that [...] "really didn't work". Slezak felt that the arrangement used was not distinct enough from the original, though he gave the performance a [...] "B+", as did West, who wrote, [...] "Mercedes looked fantastic and carried herself well, and her voice was as strong as ever but it <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> lacking." [...] In her [...] "Maria-off" [...] with Rachel, Benigno said they [...] "both kill it", characterized it as [...] "easy but fun", and gave it an [...] "A−", as did Slezak and West, the latter of whom [...] "didn't feel that Mercedes was the clear winner" [...] but thought both singers were [...] "fantastic". Kubicek thought that [...] "Mercedes clearly won" [...] and Flandez maintained that she [...] "clearly outshone her rival", and continued, [...] "You just believe so much of what she sings." [...] Berk agreed, and contrasted the two singers with his rating scale of one to five stars: [...] "Two stars for Rachel, who sang this like Barry Manilow; four for Mercedes, who sang this like she lived it." [...] Futterman had a slightly different take: [...] "Rachel puts on a diva front, but inside she's scared and nervous, while Mercedes is just a diva." [...] However, Hyman thought that the two [...] "were evenly matched", while Canning and Billboard Rae Votta both thought Rachel was the victor; Votta stated, [...] "While the show wants us to believe otherwise, Rachel clearly outsang Mercedes". [...] "It's All Over" [...] from Dreamgirls received the most enthusiastic commentary, including an [...] "A+" [...] from West, who wrote [...] "Mercedes was at her best in this performance", a sentiment echoed by Benigno when he awarded the song an [...] "A". Hyman called it [...] "pretty awesome" [...] and Flandez a [...] "cleverly amusing take", while Futterman said Mercedes [...] "fully embraces her inner Effie White" [...] and that the song was [...] "on par with the best of Glee's Broadway songs in terms of plot relevancy and vocal arrangements". She also praised [...] "the first group showtune the New Directions have done" [...] and added, [...] "we want more". Votta characterized it as [...] "a flawless fantasy homage" [...] and stated, [...] "It's the perfect use of the non-realism of [...] "Glee" [...] and the power of musical theater to express a storyline". Kubicek agreed it was [...] "like a real musical" [...] in these regards and praised Mike's short solo, and West liked the segment where Santana confronts Mercedes in the number. Slezak was not enthusiastic about the rendition, and wrote that he wished that the [...] "scene gelled better than it did", and questioned why Mercedes was the character Effie while all the other members of New Directions were themselves. He gave the number a [...] "C+".|$|E
2500|$|Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A-, saying, [...] "I'll save you the worry: it's good. It's not incredible, but it works, and it's proof that running time {{really was the}} biggest {{drawback}} with the movies. Danny Gallagher of TV Squad said in his review [...] "The story itself also <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too forced with it's tied up ending, but it still had {{a great sense of}} surprise and shock that worked like a perfect 'Twilight Zone' parody".|$|E
