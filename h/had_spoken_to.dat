25|$|The {{day after}} the decision, Gould says, Truesdale came {{into his office and}} {{subjected}} him to loud verbal abuse (which devolved into a shouting match) because Truesdale was upset that Gould <b>had</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> the New York Times about the Board's decision. Gould lunched with Mikva after the incident, at which time Mikva allegedly counseled Gould to allow Truesdale and the other Board members to write opinions supporting their votes in this high-profile case. Gould was unwilling to do this, and told Mikva that Truesdale was too deferential to the General Counsel's requests to make that a valuable exercise. On March 28, Gould learned that Truesdale was about to publish comments critical of Gould's contacts with the press during the baseball strike. Gould asked Mikva if the White House would be willing to privately discipline Truesdale, but Mikva indicated it would not.|$|E
