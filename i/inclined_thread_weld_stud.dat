50|$|A type of <b>stud</b> <b>welding</b> called capacitor-discharge (CD) <b>stud</b> <b>welding</b> {{differs from}} regular <b>stud</b> <b>welding</b> in that capacitor-discharge welding {{does not require}} flux. The weld time is shorter, {{enabling}} the weld to bond with little oxidation and no need for heat concentration. It also allows for small-diameter <b>studs</b> to be <b>welded</b> to thin,lightweight materials. This process uses a direct-current arc from a capacitor. The weld time in this process is between 1 and 6 milliseconds. Capacitor discharge <b>stud</b> <b>welding</b> with the latest equipment can create a weld without burn through showing {{on the opposite side}} of very thin metals. CD <b>stud</b> <b>welding</b> is often used for smaller diameter studs and pins, as well as on non-standard materials and for accuracy.

Cracking of the transverse connection between panels is a common problem that can damage deck overlays and cause connection leaking leading to corrosion of lower bridge elements. To better understand the behavior of bridge deck transverse female-to-female connections, shear and moment lab testing were performed at Utah State University for the Utah Department of Transportation. Two existing UDOT connections were tested, a <b>welded</b> <b>stud</b> connection and a post tensioned connection. A variation of the welded connection using rebar was also tested. In addition, two new curved bolt connections were tested as a new method of post tensioning a connection. The manner of connection cracking and associated cracking loads were recorded along with the ultimate connection capacities. The connections were also tested in a low cycle, high amplitude cyclical shear test. Lab testing showed that the <b>welded</b> <b>stud</b> connection had the lowest moment capacity.

40|$|Two novel {{demountable}} shear connectors for precast steel-concrete composite bridges are presented. The connectors use {{high-strength steel}} bolts, which are {{fastened to the}} steel beam {{with the aid of}} a special locking configuration that prevents slip of bolts within their holes. Moreover, the connectors promote accelerated construction and overcome typical construction tolerances issues of precast structures. Most importantly, the connectors allow bridge disassembly, and therefore, can address different bridge deterioration scenarios with minimum disturbance to traffic flow, i. e. (1) precast deck panels can be rapidly uplifted and replaced; (2) connectors can be rapidly removed and replaced; and (3) steel beams can be replaced, while precast decks and shear connectors can be reused. A series of push-out tests and a beam test were conducted to assess the behavior of the connectors and quantify the effect of important parameters. The experimental results showed that shear resistance and slip capacity can reach 2. 5 and 2. 7 times respectively of those of <b>welded</b> shear <b>studs</b> along with superior stiffness and strength against slab uplift.

The former two are loaded to service, unloaded, demounted and reassembled; all three are tested to failure. The results show that all three have higher strengths than predicted using Eurocode 4. The longer specimens have performance similar to previously published comparable welded-connector composite beam results.

40|$|Duplex {{stainless}} steel {{is used in}} shipbuilding increasingly because of its good mechanical properties and marked corrosion resistance. This steel has a two phase structure (austenite-ferrite) which is sensitive on heat input during welding because of the possible ferritisation appearance, that is, increase in ferrite content {{in the area of}} heat effected zone (HAZ) which can lead to loss of mechanical and corrosion properties.

40|$|Composite beams are {{now widely}} used in {{infrastructure}} such as steel-framed bridges, buildings and stadiums. Most of these composite beams have been built with <b>welded</b> shear <b>studs</b> due to the availability of detailed research on their properties, and standard design methods for using them. However, as composite beams age, their ability to withstand current and future loading requirements deteriorates. On the other hand, existing composite beams incorporating <b>welded</b> shear <b>studs</b> cannot be easily retrofitted to prolong their useful service life, nor can the steel and concrete components of these beams be separated securely to be reused due to the permanent fixing mechanism of the <b>welded</b> <b>studs.</b> This thesis attempts to investigate the design and behaviour of composite beams with innovative bolted connectors. The novel fixing mechanisms of these bolted connectors may enable composite beams to be retrofitted reliably and also be disassembled without much effort. With these aims in mind, the emphasis in this thesis is primarily on the following issues: ï§ï investigating the ability of bolted and welded-stud connectors to achieve composite action in normal and retrofitted composite beams ï§ï investigating the effects of time-dependent creep and shrinkage of concrete on the behaviour of composite beams incorporating either bolted connectors or welded-stud connectors ï§ï investigating the feasibility of dismantling composite beams subjected to serviceability loading by removing connector bolts. This thesis comprises many experimental and numerical studies, including the flexural behaviour of composite beams with bolted and welded-stud connectors {{as well as the}} loadâslip behaviour of the connectors. In addition, the behaviour of the beam and push-out test specimens in their respective experiments was simulated using finite element models developed in ABAQUS software.
