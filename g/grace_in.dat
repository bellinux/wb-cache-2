5|$|Drusus died {{suddenly}} 14 September 23, seemingly from natural causes. Ancient historians, such as Tacitus and Suetonius, claim he died amid a feud with the powerful Sejanus, Praetorian prefect of Rome. They allege {{that he had}} been murdered. In their account, Sejanus had seduced his wife Livilla, {{and with the help of}} a doctor she had poisoned Drusus. Despite the rumors, Tiberius did not suspect Sejanus and the two remained friends until Sejanus' fall from <b>grace</b> <b>in</b> 31.|$|E

5|$|Although still wary of one another, the Russian and Austrian commanders were {{satisfied}} with the result of their cooperation. They had outfought Frederick's army in a test of nerve, courage and military skills. Elizabeth of Russia promoted Saltykov to Generalfeldmarschall and awarded a special medal to everyone involved. She also sent a sword of honor to Laudon. The price of this rout, though, was high: 26 percent Austrian and Russian losses would not usually qualify as a victory. The storming of field works typically resulted in a disproportionate number of killed over wounded. The conclusion of the battle in hand-to-hand struggle also increased casualties on both sides. Finally, subsequent cavalry charges and the stampeding flight of men and horses had caused many more injuries. Regardless of the losses, though, Saltykov and Laudon remained on the field with intact armies, and with extant communications between one another. The Prussian defeat remained without consequences when the victors did not capitalize on the opportunity to march against Berlin, but retired to Saxony instead. If Saltykov had sought the coup de <b>grâce</b> <b>in</b> the last hour of the battle, he did not follow through with it.|$|E

5|$|During the 19th century {{good quality}} {{limestone}} {{and a small}} amount of lead ore were quarried in the village. Jasper was mined at Carreg; granite was quarried at Porth y Pistyll; and there was a brickworks at Porth Neigwl. The main source of income, however, was herring fishing. A regular shipping service was operated to Liverpool, exporting pigs, poultry and eggs; the vessels returned laden with coal for the neighbourhood. Limestone was also imported and offloaded into the water at high tide, then collected from the beach when the tide went out. Lime was needed to reduce the acidity of the local soil, and lime kilns were built on the beaches at Porthor, Porth Orion, Porth Meudwy, Aberdaron and Y Rhiw to convert the limestone to quicklime. There was shipbuilding at Porth Neigwl, where the last ship, a sloop named the Ebenezer, was built in 1841; and at Porthor, which came to an end with the building of a schooner, the Sarah, in 1842. Aberdaron's last ship, the sloop Victory, had been built in 1792, and the last ship to come out of Porth Ysgo had been another sloop, the <b>Grace,</b> <b>in</b> 1778.|$|E
5|$|Henry Clifford lived until 1523. Under {{him and his}} son– {{also called}} Henry, who later became Earl of Cumberland– the castle was {{intermittently}} in use as a residence for the family. After Brough Castle was destroyed in a fire in 1521 {{it is likely that}} Brougham became the new administrative centre and focus of the local lordship. As Earl of Cumberland Henry controlled Penrith and Carlisle, although he was an unpopular landlord. When the north of England rose up in the Pilgrimage of <b>Grace</b> <b>in</b> 1536, Henry was one of those targeted by the rebels. He confronted the rebel leaders at Kirkby Stephen in February 1537, and after his defeat he retreated to Brougham Castle. After the Pilgrimage of Grace was suppressed, there were reforms of regional government in the north west. One of the results was that the title of Earl of Cumberland no longer gave Clifford wardenship of Penrith and Carlisle, with Brougham Castle once again becoming the Cliffords' northern-most castle.|$|E
5|$|Hesketh-Prichard was {{a talented}} cricketer, and played {{for a number}} of teams, {{including}} Hampshire, London County, and Marylebone Cricket Club. A right-arm fast bowler, he made his début in the first class game when he played for Hampshire against Somerset in the 1900 County Championship. He was not however a strong batsman, and would typically play in the tail of the batting order. He joined the short-lived London County in 1902, where he was a teammate of W. G. <b>Grace.</b> <b>In</b> 1903 he played his first of several games for The Gentlemen v The Players at Lords. He would be selected for The Gentleman three years in succession. In 1904, he joined the MCC, and took part in Lord Brackley's XI's tour of the West Indies in the 1904/5 season. In 1907, he toured the United States with the MCC.|$|E

5|$|In Reformed theology, sacraments {{are held}} to be, along with the word of God preached, the means of <b>grace.</b> <b>In</b> the sacraments, God graciously condescends to use common {{material}} objects to communicate divine promises to people. The grace promised consists not only in benefits which God bestows on people, but Christ's person himself, to whom God unites the believer. Sacraments confirm or ratify the promises communicated in preaching. Both preaching and the sacraments are not merely symbolic and representative of the reality to which they refer, but actually create the reality of saving grace. The sacraments are made efficacious by the Holy Spirit in actually bringing into effect the promises signified in the sacraments. This efficacy is only beneficial, however, {{for those who have}} faith. The sacrament remains efficacious regardless of the recipient's response. Its effect is negative, resulting in judgement, for the faithless; while it confers Christ and his benefits for the faithful.|$|E
5|$|Percy died at Wressle in 1527 and was {{succeeded by}} his son, Henry Algernon Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland. The Pilgrimage of Grace {{was a popular}} revolt against the rule of Henry VIII in 1536 partly in {{response}} to the dissolution of the monasteries. The rebels in Yorkshire were led by Robert Aske and in October he sought the support of the Percy family. Aske travelled to Wressle Castle and tried to persuade Henry Algernon Percy, who at the time was suffering from illness, to join the rebellion. Though initially opposed to Aske, Percy eventually gave him control of Wressle Castle. Percy had fallen out with his younger brothers, and when he died in 1537 his one surviving brother did not inherit because he was imprisoned {{for his role in the}} Pilgrimage of <b>Grace.</b> <b>In</b> 1537, the crown again resumed control of Wressle Castle, and Henry VIII visited for three nights in 1541.|$|E
