500|$|Richard Buxton of Tracksounds {{wrote an}} {{ambivalent}} review, calling the album a [...] "valiant effort" [...] and Djawadi's [...] "most consistently satisfying work to date". The soundtrack {{also received a}} score of 4.5/5 from Heather Phares of AllMusic. Jørn Tillnes, writing for Soundtrack Geek, highlighted the opening theme as [...] "one of the better main themes for any television series out there. It is epic and massive, and that theme is just something you <b>give</b> <b>yourself</b> up to. It’s that good and can’t be missed." [...] Jonathan Weilbaecher praises the soundtrack as doing [...] "a supreme job mixing emotion with epic, a trick that even the very best {{have a hard time}} with." ...|$|E

2500|$|In reply, Eminescu stated that, {{regardless}} of the Slavic suffix in Eminovici, his own lineage was Moldavian and aristocratic. Author and psychologist [...] Vlad Mixich cites Eminescu's full answer as a sample of press insult in late 19th-century Romania: [...] "The things Mr. N. Xenopoulos says are, in my view, the figments of a fomenting imagination, excited by the sting of my putdown. But {{who do you think}} you are to be allowed, at your age and with the knowledge you don't have, to <b>give</b> <b>yourself</b> such superior airs?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Rolling Stone {{called it}} an [...] "inventively {{arranged}} tune... that builds from a soothing beginning to a resounding climax". Bill Graham of Hot Press praised the song, suggesting it may be Bono's [...] "most controlled vocal, building from an almost conversational first verse over a bare rhythm section to a soul-baring confession". Graham suggested the lyric [...] "And you <b>give</b> <b>yourself</b> away" [...] was essential to U2's message. The Sunday Independent suggested that the song was proof the band could be commercially accessible, yet not resort to rock clichés. NME called it [...] "some kind of love song" [...] and found musical and lyrical symmetry between the song and the group's 1981 album October.|$|E
2500|$|Grandmaster (GM) John Nunn adds a caveat: when {{in a bad}} position, {{one must}} decide between two strategies, which he calls [...] "grim [...] " [...] and [...] "create confusion." [...] "Grim defence" [...] {{involves}} finding some way to hang on, often by liquidating to an ending. [...] "Create confusion" [...] entails trying to [...] "gain the initiative, even at material cost, hoping to stir up complications and cause the opponent to go wrong." [...] Nunn cautions that, [...] "If you decide to go for 'create confusion' then you should press the panic button sufficiently early to <b>give</b> <b>yourself</b> a reasonable chance of success. However, you should be sure that your position is really bad enough to warrant such drastic measures. In my experience, {{it is far more}} common to panic too early than too late." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bono's vocals {{enter at}} 0:28 {{in a low}} register, a stark {{contrast}} from Bono's typical singing style to that point in the group's career. He stays below the middle C {{for the first two}} and a half stanzas, centering his melody on the mediant F. At the end of each of the first two stanzas, his vocals drop an octave, from A to A. Author Susan Fast called Bono's vocals on [...] "With or Without You" [...] the first occasion on which he [...] "extended his vocal range downward in an appreciable way". At 0:58, an additional sustained guitar part joins the mix. The drums increase in intensity at 1:45, before The Edge begins playing the song's signature guitar riff at 1:53. The riff, a perfect fifth opening to a sixth, features a prominent use of delay. When the riff is played, it is answered by Bono singing [...] "And you <b>give</b> <b>yourself</b> away", a line on which backing vocals appear at 2:06 and 2:32.|$|E
2500|$|The lyrics ostensibly {{describe}} a troubled relationship between two lovers, although the lyrics have been interpreted in religious contexts. The Washington Post interpreted the song as both an acerbic love song and a tune lamenting the moral contradictions one faces with their religious faith. Toby Creswell echoed these sentiments, saying it [...] "can {{be read as}} a song about either marital romance or spiritual need". Bono explained that the lyrics had romantic intentions, saying, [...] "there's nothing more revolutionary than two people loving each other. One, 'cause it's so uncommon these days, and two, 'cause it's so difficult to do." [...] In 1987, Bono explained that [...] "And you <b>give</b> <b>yourself</b> away" [...] lyric refers to how he sometimes feels exposed being in U2, and that his openness, both to the public and music press, can do damage to the group. Author Niall Stokes interpreted the line as encompassing the theme of [...] "surrendering the ego" [...] to one's love and spiritual faith.|$|E
2500|$|Scott Miller {{chose to}} name his new band [...] "Game Theory" [...] as {{an allusion to}} the {{mathematical}} field of game theory, which he described as [...] "the study of calculating the most appropriate action given an adversary, ... someone who was thinking against you, {{and you had to}} organize what his moves could be, and what your moves should be, to <b>give</b> <b>yourself</b> the minimum amount of failure." [...] In a 1988 interview, Miller stated, [...] "It's a theory of probability that's a mathematical discipline that more or less has been applied improperly to real-life situations. It's just that idea of a set of rules that gets misused that intrigued me about it.... kind of a telling comment on life in general—that you just have {{to have some sort of}} set of rules, but who knows what the set of rules should be." [...] That theme, according to Miller, was what many Game Theory songs were about: [...] "Always be wary of the superstructure of whatever situation you're in. It may just be that the whole game that you're into is something very bogus and you should get out." ...|$|E
