A range of studies demonstrate that bupropion not only produces fewer sexual side effects than other antidepressants, but can actually help to alleviate sexual dysfunction.

5|$|Overall, anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that temazepam {{may be the most}} psychologically habit-forming (addictive) benzodiazepine. Temazepam abuse reached epidemic proportions {{in some parts of the}} world, in particular, in Europe and Australia, and is a major <b>drug</b> <b>of</b> abuse in many Southeast Asian countries. This led authorities of various countries to place temazepam under a more restrictive legal status. Some countries, such as Sweden, banned the drug outright. Temazepam also has certain pharmacokinetic properties of absorption, distribution, elimination, and clearance that make it more apt to abuse compared to many other benzodiazepines.|$|E
5|$|Penicillin {{has been}} {{suggested}} as the <b>drug</b> <b>of</b> choice {{for the treatment of}} S.iniae infection in mammals, including humans. In the 1995–1996 cluster of human cases, all clinical s were susceptible to penicillin, several cephalosporins, clindamycin, erythromycin, and co-trimoxazole (MICs 0.25µg/ml); all nine patients were treated with parenteral beta-lactam antibiotics and recovered uneventfully. A study of isolates submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between 2000 and 2004 found all to be sensitive to beta-lactams, macrolides, quinolones, and vancomycin.|$|E
5|$|Drugs {{function}} by binding {{to specific}} locations on target molecules and causing some desired change, such as disabling a target or causing a conformational change. Ideally, a drug should act very specifically, and bind only to its target without interfering with other biological functions. However, {{it is difficult}} to precisely determine where and how tightly two molecules will bind. Due to limits in computing power, current in silico methods usually must trade speed for accuracy; e.g., use rapid protein docking methods instead of computationally costly free energy calculations. Folding@home's computing performance allows researchers to use both methods, and evaluate their efficiency and reliability. Computer-assisted drug design has the potential to expedite and lower the costs of drug discovery. In 2010, Folding@home used MSMs and free energy calculations to predict the native state of the villin protein to within 1.8 angstrom (Å) root mean square deviation (RMSD) from the crystalline structure experimentally determined through X-ray crystallography. This accuracy has implications to future protein structure prediction methods, including for intrinsically unstructured proteins. Scientists have used Folding@home to research drug resistance by studying vancomycin, an antibiotic <b>drug</b> <b>of</b> last resort, and beta-lactamase, a protein that can break down antibiotics like penicillin.|$|E

5|$|Herpes {{antiviral}} therapy {{began in}} the early 1960s with the experimental use of medications that interfered with viral replication called deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) inhibitors. The original use was against normally fatal or debilitating illnesses such as adult encephalitis, keratitis, in immunocompromised (transplant) patients, or disseminated herpes zoster. The original compounds used were 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine, AKA idoxuridine, IUdR, or(IDU) and 1-β-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine or ara-C, later marketed under the name cytosar or cytorabine. The usage expanded to include topical treatment of herpes simplex, zoster, and varicella. Some trials combined different antivirals with differing results. The introduction of 9-β-D-arabinofuranosyladenine, (ara-A or vidarabine), considerably less toxic than ara-C, in the mid-1970s, heralded the way for the beginning of regular neonatal antiviral treatment. Vidarabine was the first systemically administered antiviral medication with activity against HSV for which therapeutic efficacy outweighed toxicity for the management of life-threatening HSV disease. Intravenous vidarabine was licensed for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1977. Other experimental antivirals of that period included: heparin, trifluorothymidine (TFT), Ribivarin, interferon, Virazole, and 5-methoxymethyl-2'-deoxyuridine (MMUdR). The introduction of 9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)guanine, AKA acyclovir, in the late 1970s raised antiviral treatment another notch and led to vidarabine vs. acyclovir trials in the late 1980s. The lower toxicity and ease of administration over vidarabine has led to acyclovir becoming the <b>drug</b> <b>of</b> choice for herpes treatment after it was licensed by the FDA in 1998. Another advantage in the treatment of neonatal herpes included greater reductions in mortality and morbidity with increased dosages, which did not occur when compared with increased dosages of vidarabine. However, acyclovir seems to inhibit antibody response, and newborns on acyclovir antiviral treatment experienced a slower rise in antibody titer than those on vidarabine.|$|E

40|$|Drug {{addiction}} {{is a public}} health and social burden. Presently, the most abused illicit substance is cannabis, followed by amphetamines, cocaine and opioids, with different prevalence in different countries. Several evidences support a role for oxidative stress in the toxicity induced by many <b>drugs</b> <b>of</b> abuse in different organs, such as the brain, heart, liver or kidneys. This leads to oxidation of important cellular macromolecules, and may culminate in cell dysfunction and death. In this review we describe the evidences for oxidative damage and depletion of antioxidants upon exposure to <b>drugs</b> <b>of</b> abuse, especially amphetamines, cocaine and opiates. We also discuss the sources of oxidative stress induced by <b>drugs</b> <b>of</b> abuse, including oxidative metabolism <b>of</b> <b>drugs,</b> oxidative metabolism <b>of</b> monoamines by monoamine oxidases or by auto-oxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity, microglial activation, inflammation, hyperthermia and the effects <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> interactions. These consolidate oxidative stress as a relevant mechanism contributing for the cytotoxicity <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>of</b> abuse and for behavioral changes associated with drug addiction...|$|R
40|$|<b>Drugs</b> <b>of</b> abuse {{share with}} {{conventional}} reinforcers the activation of specific neural pathways in the CNS {{that are the}} substrate of their motivational properties. Dopamine is recognized as the transmitter of one such neural pathway, being involved {{in at least three}} major aspects of motivation: modulation of motivational state, acquisition (incentive learning) and expression of incentive properties by motivational stimuli. <b>Drugs</b> <b>of</b> abuse of different pharmacological classes stimulate in the low dose range dopamine transmission particularly in the ventral striatum. Apart from psychostimulants, the evidence that stimulation of dopamine transmission by <b>drugs</b> <b>of</b> abuse provides the primary motivational stimulus for drug self-administration is either unconvincing or negative. However, stimulation of dopamine transmission is essential for the activational properties <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>of</b> abuse and might be instrumental for the acquisition of responding to drug-related incentive stimuli (incentive learning). Dopamine is involved in the induction and in the expression of behavioural sensitization by repeated exposure to various <b>drugs</b> <b>of</b> abuse. Sensitization to the dopamine-stimulant properties <b>of</b> specific <b>drug</b> classes leading to facilitation of incentive learning of drug-related stimuli might account for the strong control over behaviour exerted by these stimuli in the addiction state. Withdrawal from <b>drugs</b> <b>of</b> abuse results in a reduction in basal dopamine transmission in vivo and in reduced responding for conventional reinforcers. Although these changes are likely to be the expression of a state of dependence of the dopamine system their contribution to the motivational state <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> addiction is unclear...|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{assessment}} of the functional consequences of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and <b>drugs</b> <b>of</b> abuse are critical as large populations are afflicted with both.
