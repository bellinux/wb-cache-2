40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to compare the fitting (goodness-of-fit) and {{prediction}} capabilities of three reliability models using the <b>failure</b> <b>data</b> of five popular open source software (OSS) products. The <b>failure</b> <b>data</b> are modeled by Weibull and two other Non Homogenous Poisson Process (NHPP) models (Yamada S-Shaped and Schneidewind). The OSS products considered are Eclipse, Apache HTTP Server 2, Firefox, MPlayer OS X, and ClamWin Free Antivirus. Weibull is chosen due to its popularity in lifetime and its flexibility in modeling various distributions. On the other hand, among many software reliability models, the NHPP models are prevalent. The goodness-of-fit is based on the entire <b>failure</b> <b>data</b> collected. Prediction is accomplished by estimating the models parameters based on partial failure history and then applying the estimates to the entire time span for which <b>failure</b> <b>data</b> is collected.   The outcomes show that a reliability model that fits the <b>failure</b> <b>data</b> well may not necessarily be a decent forecaster of future failure patterns. </p...|$|R
