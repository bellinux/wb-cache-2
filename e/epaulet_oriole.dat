50|$|The <b>epaulet</b> <b>oriole</b> (Icterus cayanensis) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Icteridae. The moriche oriole, {{formerly}} considered a distinct species (I. chrysocephalus) is now placed herein as a subspecies. The variable oriole, (I. pyrrhopterus), was formerly considered conspecific, but has recently been split by the SACC.|$|E
50|$|This ecologically {{distinct}} {{bird was}} formerly {{treated as a}} species Icterus chrysocephalus. It was eventually found to be embedded in the <b>epaulet</b> <b>oriole</b> (I. cayanensis) clade. Thus, for example the AOU since 2005 has lumped the moriche oriole into I. cayanensis. The subspecific structure of I. cayanensis is still rather puzzling.|$|E
