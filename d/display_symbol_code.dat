30|$|Consider {{a set of}} t <b>code</b> <b>symbols</b> in failure. For any {{of these}} t failed <b>code</b> <b>symbols,</b> each symbol can {{have at least one}} failed <b>code</b> <b>symbol</b> in at most t− 1 of its t {{disjoint}} repair groups. This implies that the <b>code</b> <b>symbol</b> under consideration has at least one of its local repair groups free of any failures. Thus, the <b>code</b> <b>symbol</b> can be repaired with the help of one of its intact local repair groups. This leave us with t− 1 <b>code</b> <b>symbols</b> in failure (erasure). Now, for another <b>code</b> <b>symbol</b> in failure, we can have at most t− 2 of its disjoint local repair groups with at least one failed <b>code</b> <b>symbol.</b> This leaves at least 2 of its disjoint local groups intact; therefore, this <b>code</b> <b>symbol</b> can be repaired with the help of one of its intact local repair groups. Following the similar argument, we can see that all of the t failed <b>code</b> <b>symbols</b> can be repaired in a code with t disjoint repair groups for all <b>code</b> <b>symbols.</b> In the worst case, we contact at most r̃t <b>code</b> <b>symbols</b> to repair all of the t failures. This establishes the (r̃t, ℓ = t)-cooperative locality for the codes under consideration.|$|R

30|$|According to the <b>symbol</b> <b>code</b> (name) {{obtained}} in the “automatic matching and recognition of symbols” process, the corresponding target <b>symbol</b> <b>code</b> (name) can be found by querying the relationship table. To improve the query efficiency, the corresponding relationship table will be searched according to the category of the “oilfield” symbol: if the symbol is a point, the point relationship table will be searched; {{if it is a}} polyline symbol, then the polyline relationship table would be searched and so on. Based on the target <b>symbol</b> <b>code</b> (name), the target symbol can be found in its standard symbol library and can be rendered using the relevant information for an “oilfield” symbol. Subsequently, the rendered symbol is used to visualise the corresponding spatial entity to complete symbol conversion. Each symbol used in the map can thus be converted, and symbol standard conversion between different mapping standards can be realised.|$|R

Various types of codes such as permutation codes, frequency permutation arrays, and constant composition codes have been proposed over the years. In this paper, we study a type of <b>code</b> called bounded <b>symbol</b> weight <b>codes</b> which was first introduced by Versfeld et al. in 2005, and a related family of codes that we term constant <b>symbol</b> weight <b>codes.</b> We provide new {{upper and lower bounds}} on the size of bounded symbol weight and constant <b>symbol</b> weight <b>codes.</b> We also give direct and recursive constructions of codes for certain parameters.

Moreover, a <b>code</b> <b>symbol</b> can be recovered from any r/ℓ other <b>code</b> <b>symbols</b> from its local group. In the worst case, when ℓ failed <b>code</b> <b>symbols</b> belong to ℓ distinct local groups, we can recover all ℓ symbols from ℓr/ℓ = r <b>code</b> <b>symbols,</b> downloading r/ℓ symbols from each of the ℓ local groups containing one failed <b>code</b> <b>symbol.</b>|$|R

30|$|As {{a result}} of symbols being {{graphical}} representations of spatial entities, the automatic conversion of symbols between different standards can be realised, {{as long as the}} corresponding <b>symbol</b> <b>codes</b> (names) of the same spatial entity in different mapping standards are clear (Stefanakis 2002; Schlichtmann 2004). Based on this idea, the corresponding relationship between <b>symbol</b> <b>codes</b> (names) in different mapping standards can be established, and then the mutual conversion of symbols between different standards can be realised by using the established relationship. So if the symbol for a given spatial entity is known, the corresponding symbol in the target mapping standard can be found through the relationship. Nevertheless, the <b>symbol</b> <b>codes</b> (names) are usually absent in maps made by common GIS platforms, only the symbol styles and rendering information are stored. However, the symbol libraries in GIS platforms store not only <b>symbol</b> <b>codes</b> (names) but also symbol styles and rendering information. Therefore, the critical problem to be solved is to identify the special symbols of spatial entities from a map and match them with the symbols stored in symbol libraries to get the codes (names) of the symbols in the map. To recognise a symbol, a pixel-by-pixel matching approach is proposed in which the symbols in a map, and those in the symbol library with the same mapping standard, are firstly transformed into BMP images, and then the symbol images within the map are matched with images from the library, to find out the correct symbol.|$|R

50|$|The end-of-stream code is {{particularly}} interesting. If there are n different bytes (symbols) {{used in the}} uncompressed data, then the Huffman code will consist of two RLE codes (RUNA and RUNB), n − 1 <b>symbol</b> <b>codes</b> and one end-of-stream code. Because of the combined result of the MTF and RLE encodings in the previous two steps, there is never any need to explicitly reference the first symbol in the MTF table (would be zero in the ordinary MTF), thus saving one symbol for the end-of-stream marker (and explaining why only n − 1 <b>symbols</b> are <b>coded</b> in the Huffman tree). In the extreme case where only one symbol {{is used in the}} uncompressed data, there will be no <b>symbol</b> <b>codes</b> at all in the Huffman tree, and the entire block will consist of RUNA and RUNB (implicitly repeating the single byte) and an end-of-stream marker with value 2.|$|R
