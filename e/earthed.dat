25|$|Few private {{houses in}} Brazil have an <b>earthed</b> supply, {{so even if}} a three-pin socket is present it is not {{safe to assume that}} all three {{terminals}} are actually connected. Most large domestic appliances were sold with the option to fit a flying earth tail to be locally <b>earthed,</b> but many consumers were unsure how to use this and so didn't connect it. The new standard has an earth pin, which in theory eliminates the need for the flying earth tail.|$|E
25|$|The {{depth of}} the sockets varies between {{countries}} and age. Older sockets are so shallow {{that it is possible}} to touch the pins of a plug when the plug is inserted only deep enough to get electrical power on the pins, while newer sockets are deep enough to protect from this kind of accident. CEE7/1 sockets accept CEE7/4, CEE7/6 and CEE7/7 plugs without providing an earth connection. The <b>earthed</b> CEE7/3 and CEE7/5 sockets were specifically designed not to allow insertion of CEE7/2 unearthed round plugs fitted to older appliances which had to be <b>earthed</b> via other means.|$|E

The current rating on both plugs is 13A.|$|E
25|$|Electrical sockets {{for single}} phase domestic, {{commercial}} and light industrial purposes generally provide either {{two or three}} electrical connections to the supply conductors. Two-pin sockets normally provide neutral and line connections, both of which carry current and are defined as live parts. Neutral is usually very near to earth potential, usually being <b>earthed</b> either at the distribution board or at the substation. Line (also known as phase or hot, and commonly, but technically incorrectly, as live) carries the full supply voltage relative to the neutral (and to earth). Three-pin sockets provide, in addition, a protective earth connection for exposed metal parts of an appliance. If internal insulation should fail, a short-circuit to the <b>earthed</b> exposed metal parts will hold them at a low potential, and should operate fuses or circuit breakers to isolate the faulty appliance from the supply. Depending on the supply system, some sockets may have two line connections, each at significant voltage to earth and without a neutral pin; for example, a split phase system may have 240V between line connections each at 120V with respect to earth ground; but a single-phase receptacle connected to a three-phase system may have, for example, 208V between contacts and only 120V between each contact and earth ground.|$|E
25|$|The Viae glareatae were <b>earthed</b> roads with a graveled {{surface or}} a gravel {{subsurface}} and paving on top. Livy {{speaks of the}} censors of his time as being the first to contract for paving the streets of Rome with flint stones, for laying gravel on the roads outside the city, and for forming raised footpaths at the sides. In these roads, the surface was hardened with gravel, and although pavements were introduced shortly afterwards, the blocks were allowed to rest merely {{on a bed of}} small stones. An example of this type is found on the Praenestine Way. Another example is found near the Via Latina.|$|E

25|$|There {{are four}} ratings of {{plug and socket}} in BS546, (2A, 5A, 15A and 30A). Each has the same general {{appearance}} but they are different physical sizes to prevent interchangeability, they use pin spacing which is also different from the two pin plugs specified in BS 372, so <b>earthed</b> plugs will not fit into unearthed sockets, and vice versa. Plugs fitted with BS646 fuses have been optional since the original BS546:1934 with maximum fuse ratings of 2A in the 2A plug, and 5A in the 5A, 15A and 30A plugs. In practice most BS546 plugs are unfused with fused versions being unusual and expensive.|$|E
25|$|To {{prevent the}} risk of {{out-of-phase}} supplies mixing, sections of line fed from different feeder stations must be kept strictly isolated. This is achieved by Neutral Sections (also known as Phase Breaks), usually provided at feeder stations and midway between them although, typically, only half are in use at any time, the others being provided to allow a feeder station {{to be shut down}} and power provided from adjacent feeder stations. Neutral Sections usually consist of an <b>earthed</b> section of wire which is separated from the live wires on either side by insulating material, typically ceramic beads, designed so that the pantograph will smoothly run from one section to the other. The <b>earthed</b> section prevents an arc being drawn from one live section to the other, as the voltage difference may be higher than the normal system voltage if the live sections are on different phases and the protective circuit breakers {{may not be able to}} safely interrupt the considerable current that would flow. To prevent {{the risk of}} an arc being drawn across from one section of wire to earth, when passing through the neutral section, the train must be coasting and the circuit breakers must be open. In many cases, this is done manually by the drivers. To help them, a warning board is provided just before both the neutral section and an advance warning some distance before. A further board is then provided after the neutral section to tell drivers to re-close the circuit breaker, although drivers must not do this until the rear pantograph has passed this board. In the UK, a system known as Automatic Power Control (APC) automatically opens and closes the circuit breaker, this being achieved by using sets of permanent magnets alongside the track communicating with a detector on the train. The only action needed by the driver is to shut off power and coast and therefore warning boards are still provided at and on the approach to neutral sections.|$|E
25|$|Quick-start {{ballasts}} {{use a small}} auto-transformer to {{heat the}} filaments when power is first applied. When an arc strikes, the filament heating power is reduced and the tube will start within half a second. The auto-transformer is either combined with the ballast or may be a separate unit. Tubes need to be mounted near an <b>earthed</b> metal reflector {{in order for them}} to strike. Quick-start ballasts are more common in commercial installations because of lower maintenance costs. A quick-start ballast eliminates the need for a starter switch, a common source of lamp failures. Nonetheless, Quick-start ballasts are also used in domestic (residential) installations because of the desirable feature that a Quick-start ballast light turns on nearly immediately after power is applied (when a switch is turned on). Quick-start ballasts are used only on 240nbsp&V circuits and are designed for use with the older, less efficient T12 tubes.|$|E

25|$|The {{standard}} for Chinese {{plugs and sockets}} (excluding Hong Kong and Macau) is set out in GB2099.1‐2008 and GB1002‐2008. As part of China's commitment for entry into the WTO, the new CPCS (Compulsory Product Certification System) has been introduced, and compliant Chinese plugs have been awarded the CCC Mark by this system. The plug is three wire, <b>earthed,</b> rated at 10A, 250V and used for Class 1 applications; a slightly larger 16A version also exists. The nominal pin dimensions of the 10A version are: 1.5mm thick by 6.4mm wide, the line & neutral are 18mm long, and the earth is 21mm long. It {{is similar to the}} Australian plug. Many 3 pin sockets in China include a physical lockout preventing access to the active and neutral terminals unless an earth pin (which is slightly longer than the other 2 pins) is entered first. China also uses American/Japanese NEMA 1‐15 sockets and plugs for Class-II appliances. The voltage at a Chinese socket of any type is 220V.|$|E
25|$|The key {{advantage}} of the four-rail system is that neither running rail carries any current. This scheme was introduced because {{of the problems of}} return currents, intended to be carried by the <b>earthed</b> (grounded) running rail, flowing through the iron tunnel linings instead. This can cause electrolytic damage and even arcing if the tunnel segments are not electrically bonded together. The problem was exacerbated because the return current also had a tendency to flow through nearby iron pipes forming the water and gas mains. Some of these, particularly Victorian mains that predated London's underground railways, were not constructed to carry currents and had no adequate electrical bonding between pipe segments. The four-rail system solves the problem. Although the supply has an artificially created earth point, this connection is derived by using resistors which ensures that stray earth currents are kept to manageable levels. Power-only rails can be mounted on strongly insulating ceramic chairs to minimise current leak, but this is not possible for running rails which have to be seated on stronger metal chairs to carry the weight of trains. However, elastomeric rubber pads placed between the rails and chairs can now solve part of the problem by insulating the running rails from the current return should there be a leakage through the running rails.|$|E
500|$|In {{conventional}} graph {{representation of}} circuits, {{there is no}} means of explicitly representing mutual inductive couplings, such as occurs in a transformer, and such components {{may result in a}} disconnected graph with more than one separate part. [...] For convenience of analysis, a graph with multiple parts can be combined into a single graph by unifying one node in each part into a single node. [...] This makes no difference to the theoretical behaviour of the circuit so analysis carried out on it is still valid. [...] It would, however, make a practical difference if a circuit were to be implemented this way in that it would destroy the isolation between the parts. [...] An example would be a transformer <b>earthed</b> on both the primary and secondary side. [...] The transformer still functions as a transformer with the same voltage ratio but can now no longer be used as an isolation transformer.|$|E

500|$|The use of dressed stone {{rather than}} gravel as a surface {{dressing}} was also occasionally {{held to be}} a sign against the causeway being of Roman construction: the majority of Roman roads that were finished with a material other than simple packed earth were dressed in either packed gravel or pebbles. There are other examples of Roman roads paved with stone blocks, including the [...] section of the Via Appia—the oldest major Roman route in Italy—near Albano. Historians Richard A Gabriel and Michael Grant state that of the [...] of known Roman roads, over [...] may have been stone-paved. The Roman writer Ulpian specifically differentiates between via munita, which always had a paved stone surface, and via glareata, which were <b>earthed</b> roads with either gravelled surfaces, or a gravelled subsurface and paving on top. The causeway may well have had a gravel surface dressing originally, which has been removed since through robbing and natural weathering. Another difference in construction detail between Wade's Causeway and a typical Roman road is its lack of a foundation of large stones. Codrington and archaeologist John Ward stress that the structure of Roman roads varied greatly depending upon their situation and the materials available, especially within Britain.|$|E
