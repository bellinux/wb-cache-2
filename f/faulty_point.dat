40|$|In {{this thesis}} we have {{developed}} a new algorithmic countermeasures that protect elliptic curve computation by protecting computation of the finite binary extension field, against fault attacks. Firstly, we have proposed schemes, i. e., a Chinese Remainder Theorem based fault tolerant computation in finite field for use in ECCs, as well as Lagrange Interpolation based fault tolerant computation. Our approach {{is based on the}} error correcting codes, i. e., redundant residue polynomial codes and the use of first original approach of Reed-Solomon codes. Computation of the field elements is decomposed into parallel, mutually independent, modular/identical channels, so that in case of faults at one channel, errors will not distribute to other channels. Based on these schemes {{we have developed}} new algorithms, namely fault tolerant residue representation modular multiplication algorithm and fault tolerant Lagrange representation modular multiplication algorithm, which are immune against error propagation under the fault models that we propose: Random Fault Model, Arbitrary Fault Model, and Single Bit Fault Model. These algorithms provide fault tolerant computation in GF (2 k) for use in ECCs. Our new developed algorithms where inputs, i. e., field elements, are represented by the redundant residue representation/ redundant lagrange representation enables us to overcome the problem if during computation one, or both coordinates x, y GF (2 k) of the point P E/GF (2 k) /Fk are corrupted. We assume that during each run of an attacked algorithm, in one single attack, an adversary can apply any of the proposed fault models, i. e., either Random Fault Model, or Arbitrary Fault Model, or Single Bit Fault Model. In this way more channels can be targeted, i. e., different fault models can be used on different channels. Also, our proposed algorithms can have masked errors and will not be immune against attacks which can create those kind of errors, but it is a difficult problem to counter masked errors, since any anti-fault attack scheme will have some masked errors. Moreover, we have derived conditions that inflicted error needs to have in order to yield undetectable <b>faulty</b> <b>point</b> on non-supersingular elliptic curve over GF(2 k). Our algorithmic countermeasures can be applied to any public key cryptosystem that performs computation over the finite field GF (2 k) ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractElectrical {{power systems}} often operate with {{significantly}} {{larger numbers of}} small-scale highly dispersed generation units. The need to mange, operate, monitor and control the performance of these systems has increased the requirements of finding new control venues that facilitate achieving a reliable automation that makes disturbance monitoring, classifications and measurements a common practice for utilities. In order to operate such power systems securely and efficiently {{it will be necessary}} to monitor and control output levels and scheduling when connecting such generation to a power system especially when it is typically embedded at the distribution level. Traditional monitoring and control technology that is currently employed at the transmission level is highly centralized and not scalable to include such significant increases in distributed and embedded generation. This paper presents an ongoing research work that defines an agent-based distribution architecture that supports ad hoc and automated system configurations emphasizing the strategies for achieving, locating and isolating faults without degrading the quality of services. The overall network is viewed as a cooperative distributed electric power system (CDEPS) and modelled as distributed intelligent agents that work together to achieve a common global goal in an ambient setting.

Harness hang syndrome appears to relate to suspension with the legs below the heart, as in the case when someone is suspended in a standing position, with no weight on their legs. Extracting a person safely out of suspension bondage can be difficult if they are unconscious, or if a winch or hoist jams.

The data cover the monitoring period August 1, 1994, to July 31, 1995, and the performance parameters analyzed include direct current and alternating current power, aperture-area efficiency, energy, capacity factor, and performance index. These parameters are compared to plane-of-array irradiance, ambient temperature, and back-of-module temperature as a function of time, either daily or monthly. We also obtained power ratings of the systems for data corresponding to different test conditions. This study has shown, in addition to expected seasonal trends, that system monitoring is a valuable tool in assessing performance and detecting faulty equipment. Furthermore, methods applied for this analysis may be used to evaluate and compare systems using cells of different technologies. The systems were both found to be operating at approximately 7 % below their estimated rating, which was based on Photovoltaics for Utility-Scale Applications test conditions. This may be attributed to the design inverter efficiency being estimated at 95 % compared to measured values of approximately 88 %, as well as the fact that aperture-area efficiency that was overestimated at 12. 8 % compared to a measured value of 11. 0 %.

Patient satisfaction with restorations which is an important aspect {{of quality of}} care assessment has also never been done. To ensure quality restorative care is provided it is mandatory to assess quality of restorations as well as patient satisfaction with restorations received. Objective To evaluate quality of direct coronal restorations and determine patient satisfaction with the restorations placed at dental clinics within Dar es Salaam city. Material and methods A cross sectional study was conducted between June and December 2009 at Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH), Mwananyamala, Temeke, and Mnazi mmoja dental clinics. Modified USPHS Ryge 1980 criteria and patient satisfaction questionnaire were used to assess technical quality of the restorations and patient satisfaction, respectively. Quality of restorations and patient satisfaction data was analysed using SPSS version 14 program. Results A total of 200 patients with majority being females (71. 5 %) were enrolled. The participants had 516 direct coronal restorations of which 48 % were amalgam restorations. Sixty three percent of the examined restorations were of acceptable quality.

40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{improvements}} to the Non-linear Principal Component Analysis (NLPCA) method are presented. In the normal application of this method, a non-linear curve C is found that best fits the data. The method provides a projection function mapping from the data space to the curve C. However, this projection function is <b>faulty</b> in that <b>points</b> in the data space are generally not projected onto their closest neighbours on C. Here, a new projection function is introduced which ensures that the data points are projected onto their closest neighbours on C, resulting {{in an increase in}} the amount of variance explained by the NLPCA mode. This is illustrated by an analysis of the sea surface temperature anomaly data from the tropical Pacific, where the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon is manifested. A second shortcoming of the NLPCA method is that the curve C comes with a parametrization which is arbitrary and has no physical interpretation. Here, the curve is re-parametrized by arc length. This allows the computation of more meaningful time series, which we illustrate through an analysis of the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) in the equatorial stratospheric zonal wind data.
