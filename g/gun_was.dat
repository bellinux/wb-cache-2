5|$|The Man {{with the}} Golden <b>Gun</b> <b>was</b> {{published}} in the UK on 1 April 1965 by Jonathan Cape, was 221 pages long and cost eighteen shillings. Cover artist Richard Chopping undertook the cover design again and was paid 300 guineas for the artwork. The Man with the Golden <b>Gun</b> <b>was</b> {{published in the}} US in August 1965, was 183 pages long and cost $4.50. Even before the US edition was published, The Man with the Golden <b>Gun</b> <b>was</b> ninth place on the best-seller lists, with 80,000 pre-orders for the hardback version.|$|E
5|$|The <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} {{displayed at}} George Town's Esplanade; in the 1950s it {{was moved to}} Fort Cornwallis.|$|E
2500|$|... 57 55 J was {{accepted}} {{for use as}} training weapon in 1950s {{because of a lack}} of suitable training guns and no funds to buy new ones. The old 57mm Nordenfelt and Hotchkiss <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> worn-out, and 76mm <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> kept in reserve, so 57 55 J, among other old <b>guns,</b> <b>was</b> used as training piece. Some of the <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> converted for sub-caliber training for the 234/50 Be and 305/52 O <b>guns.</b> The <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> refurbished at beginning of the 1960s and sub-caliber <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> converted back to the normal configuration, but the <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> removed from use and placed into storage in 1965–1966.|$|R
50|$|Two of the 5.5-inch <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> {{mounted on}} the {{centreline}} fore and aft of the superstructure and the remaining eight <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> positioned on the broadside. All these <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> fitted with <b>gun</b> shields. Two Vickers 3-pounder (47 mm) anti-aircraft <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> also fitted. The armament was completed by two submerged 21-inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes.|$|R
50|$|She was {{initially}} armed with two Armstrong 254 mm rifled muzzle-loading (RML) guns mounted {{in a single}} turret. In 1875 a pair of 76 mm RML <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> added. Four years later a pair of 87 mm rifled breech-loading <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> also added and four more 87-millimeter <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> added in 1889. Two years later a pair of quick-firing (QF) 57 mm Hotchkiss <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> added. The 254-millimeter <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> ultimately replaced {{by a pair of}} QF 150 mm guns.|$|R
5|$|A <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> {{said to be}} {{honeycombed}} {{when the}} surface of the bore had cavities, or holes in it, caused either by corrosion or casting defects.|$|E
5|$|A troop with a Hotchkiss <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> {{ordered to}} {{the shore of the}} Sea of Galilee to the north of Tiberias, where they cut the garrison's only line of retreat.|$|E
5|$|After the war the <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> {{supplied}} to many {{countries around the}} globe, including former Warsaw Pact allies, such as Poland. As of the early 2000s it remains in service in Afghanistan, Albania, China, Cuba, Hungary, Iraq, Mozambique, Syria, Vietnam and other countries. The <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> employed in the Arab-Israeli Conflict and also in some conflicts in former republics of Soviet Union. The long operational history of D-1 howitzers in the national armies of numerous countries is an additional testimony to its qualities.|$|E
25|$|Two more <b>guns</b> <b>are</b> emplaced in Libertatii Square in Timisoara. A fifth <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> {{preserved}} in the Dej Military Museum.|$|R
50|$|She was {{initially}} armed with two Armstrong 227 mm rifled muzzle-loading (RML) guns mounted {{in a single}} turret. In 1876 a pair of 76 mm RML <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> added. Four years later a pair of 87 mm rifled breech-loading <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> also added and the 76-millimeter <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> replaced by another pair of 87-millimeter breech-loading guns in 1885. The 227-millimeter <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> ultimately replaced {{by a pair of}} quick-firing 150 mm guns.|$|R
50|$|In 1913 {{an initial}} order of 471 <b>guns</b> <b>was</b> placed with OSP. By 1 January 1917 143 <b>guns</b> had <b>been</b> delivered, with 96 due {{until the end}} of that year. The {{remaining}} 282 <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> supposed to be delivered in 1918. The first charge of <b>guns</b> <b>was</b> used to equipped the cruiser Svetlana and the Imperatritsa Mariya-class battleships of the Black Sea Fleet.|$|R
5|$|An {{experimental}} fire-control {{director was}} fitted {{in the forward}} spotting top and evaluated in May 1910. The guns on the forward turret roof were transferred to the superstructure in 1913–1914 and the roof guns from the wing turrets were remounted in the aft superstructure about a year later; all of the four-inch guns in the superstructure were enclosed to better protect their crews. In addition, a single three-inch (76mm) anti-aircraft (AA) <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> added on the former searchlight platform between the aft turrets. Shortly afterwards, the guns on the aft turret were removed as were one pair from the superstructure. Around the same time another three-inch AA <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> added to the aft turret roof.|$|E
5|$|Another project {{combining}} the T-34 tank chassis with the D-15 <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> also considered. Designated SU-D15, the medium assault <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> {{intended as a}} replacement for the SU-122. Although the project received a lot of support from the authorities it never entered production, both because of its shortcomings (the heavy gun put too much strain on the suspension and ammunition stowage was too limited) and because it was made redundant by the ISU-152. However lessons learned mounting a powerful gun in the T-34 allowed for rapid development of the SU-100 tank destroyer.|$|E
5|$|Defence {{received}} a QF 12-pounder (3-inch) 12 cwt anti-aircraft (AA) gun and a QF 3-pounder (47mm) AA gun in 1915–16. The 12-pounder <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> {{mounted on the}} aft superstructure and the 3-pounder on the quarterdeck at the extreme rear.|$|E

50|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the war in 1878, Aziziye was laid up in Constantinople. In 1884, the 36-pounder <b>gun</b> <b>were</b> removed and a light battery of four 47 mm quick-firing (QF) Hotchkiss guns and two 4-barreled 25.4 mm Nordenfelt <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> added. She was refitted at the Imperial Arsenal, with work lasting from 1890 to 1894. During the refit, she received two vertical triple-expansion engines in place of her original machinery, and six coal-fired Scotch marine boilers replaced the box boilers; the new propulsion system allowed her to steam at a speed of 10 kn. Her armament was radically revised; all of the old muzzle-loaders were removed and a battery of new Krupp breech-loading <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> installed. Two Krupp 240 mm K L/35 <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> added in individual barbettes, one forward and one aft.

Two of the 47 mm <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> removed and three more Nordenfelt <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> added.|$|R
25|$|In all ships bar Sussex, four 4-inch <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> {{added in}} single {{mountings}} abreast the funnels. The single 2-pounder <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> removed, and two quadruple mounts for 0.5-inch Vickers machine <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> added. Shropshire acquired an additional anti-aircraft fire control director. Early in the war, the additional 4-inch <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> removed, {{and the original}} 4-inch guns altered to the Mark XVI twin mounts. The octuple 2-pounder guns that had originally been designed in were also finally added.|$|R

5|$|The Smith <b>Gun</b> <b>was</b> {{an ad hoc}} {{anti-tank}} artillery piece used by the British Army and Home Guard {{during the}} Second World War. With a German invasion of Great Britain seeming likely after the defeat in the Battle of France, most available weaponry was diverted to the regular British Army, leaving the Home Guard short on supplies, particularly anti-tank weaponry. The Smith <b>Gun</b> <b>was</b> designed by a retired Army Major named William H. Smith as a makeshift anti-tank weapon, and was put into production in 1941 following a demonstration to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill.|$|E

50|$|By early June 1945, all field <b>gun</b> and howitzers <b>were</b> destroyed, machine <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> down to 20% {{of normal}} complement, and mortars with {{infantry}} support <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> down to 10% of normal complement.|$|R
5|$|The <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> a {{traditional}} muzzleloader; {{it needed to}} be loaded {{from the end of the}} barrel. Before it could be loaded the bore of the barrel was cleaned with a sponge, after which a propellant charge (gunpowder in a cloth bag) was rammed down into the breech. This was followed by a projectile, often encased in wadding. The <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> primed (using a metal spike inserted through the vent that pierced the charge), and fired using a percussion cap (which ignited the charge and forced the projectile out of the barrel).|$|E
5|$|The <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> {{manufactured}} by Watervliet Arsenal and the carriage by Rock Island Arsenal. The first pieces were delivered early in 1940, the production continued until 1943.|$|E

5|$|According to {{historian}} L. T. C. Rolt, {{the original}} installation was of machines for wire-braiding crinoline frames, and Charles simultaneously imported metal cutting machine tools to aid his friend Hiram Maxim who was developing a machine gun. This is a moot point: the Maxim <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> not developed {{for a further}} 20 years, and {{it is unlikely that}} Maxim was in England during the 1860s; however, the Gatling <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> patented in 1862. Rolt claimed that Charles Churchill & Co began trading in 1865 as importers of engineering tools and is thought to have imported the first examples of Morse tapered twist drills, self-centring drill chucks (manufactured by Cushman) and hand-held micrometers into the UK. According to Floud, he imported agricultural implements and other non-engineering items at this time. In its early years the company traded from 28 Wilson Street, Finsbury: sales catalogues were published certainly between 1876 and 1882 stating this address.|$|E
5|$|Blowing from a <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> a {{reported}} means of execution {{as long ago}} as the 16th century, by the Mughal Empire, and was used until the 20th century. The method was utilized by Portuguese colonialists in the 16th and 17th centuries, from as early as 1509 across their empire from Ceylon (modern day Sri Lanka) to Mozambique to Brazil. The Mughals used the method throughout the 17th century and into the 18th, particularly against rebels.|$|E

50|$|There {{were two}} main {{series of the}} 120/45 guns produced. The first series of 76 <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> built between 1897-1905 at the Obhukov factory. During the Russo-Japanese war a number of barrels of the 152/45 guns burst in action and a {{strengthened}} series of 152/45 and 120/45 <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> ordered. 34 of the second series of strengthened <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> built between 1905-1915 at the Obhukov factory.
