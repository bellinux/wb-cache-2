Otters were not spotted for years though. Recent but unconfirmed sightings of otters recently prompted the ecology organisations from Sremska Mitrovica to announce an award for those who capture otter on camera. Fur animals also live in Zasavica, most notably muskrat. Eurasian shrew, striped field mouse, fat dormouse and several species of bats are listed as rarities in Serbia.|$|E

40|$|Between 1996 and 1998, 477 dead otters from {{different}} Central European countries were examined for urolithiasis, including 449 free-ranging <b>Eurasian</b> <b>otters</b> (Lutra lutra) {{as well as}} 17 <b>Eurasian</b> <b>otters</b> and 11 Asian small-clawed otters (Aonyx cinerea) from captivity. In the free-ranging specimens, uroliths (sand or stones) were found in 105 animals (23. 4 %), with no significant difference (P = 0. 77) between the sexes. Uroliths were not present in any juveniles (n = 26) and urolithiasis was not considered {{the main cause of}} death in any individual. In captive specimens, uroliths were found in 11 out of 17 <b>Eurasian</b> <b>otters</b> (64. 7 %; four males and seven females), and in 3 out of 11 Asian small-clawed otters (27. 3 %). Histology could not find any signs of inflammation in examined kidneys (n = 179) or urinary bladders (n = 66). Analyzed stones of free-ranging and captive <b>Eurasian</b> <b>otters</b> were composed mainly of ammonium acid urate. The stones of three captive Asian small-clawed otters consisted mainly of calcium oxalate. The difference in prevalence of uroliths between free-ranging and captive <b>Eurasian</b> <b>otters</b> was significant (P = 0. 001). Nevertheless, the prevalence in free-ranging specimens of this study is higher than reported before. Differences between various habitats, environmental changes, and genetic predisposition all represent potential hypothetical explanations for these findings...|$|R

Results of the study indicated that Sheer Palam, Tormang, Patrak, Kalkot and Tal (Upper Dir), Madyan, Baronial, Mankial and Peshmal (Swat) are the key habitats to host <b>Eurasian</b> <b>otters.</b> Secondary data (community questionnaires) indicated 79 % people consider that <b>Eurasian</b> <b>otters</b> are permanent residents in the study area, 12. 5 % thought otters were seasonal migrants while 8. 5 % people {{were not able to}} report otter status.

The results indicated that the distribution range of the otter covers some potential areas of Swat and Upper Dir in Pakistan.

40|$|Background Toxoplasma gondii {{is found}} on all continents and can infect all {{endothermic}} vertebrates. Toxoplasmosis is a globally important zoonosis with potentially devastating health impacts both for humans {{and a range}} of domestic and wild species. The World Health Organisation have repeatedly recommended the collection of accurate epidemiological data for T. gondii, yet despite recognised links between infection of wildlife, domestic animals and humans, seroprevalence in wild species is rarely monitored. Here, serological investigation using the Gold Standard Sabin-Feldman Dye Test was used to test for T. gondii in <b>Eurasian</b> <b>otters</b> (Lutra lutra) found dead, mainly as road-kill, in England and Wales. This is the first spatially widespread study of T. gondii in UK wildlife, and the first extensive survey of T. gondii in <b>Eurasian</b> <b>otters,</b> a sentinel species of fresh waters.

5000|$|The <b>Eurasian</b> <b>otter's</b> diet mainly {{consists}} of fish. [...] Fish is their most preferred choice {{of food in}} Mediterranean and temperate freshwater habitats. During the winter and in colder environments, though, fish consumption is signiﬁcantly lower, and the otters use other sources of food, including amphibians, crustaceans, insects, birds and sometimes small mammals, including young beavers.|$|R
40|$|<b>Eurasian</b> <b>otters</b> (Lutra lutra) {{have been}} {{described}} in the literature as solitary, with the 2 sexes interacting only during mating. Data on otter sociality are rather scant, however, especially in Mediterranean regions, and the group formation documented in temperate zones has suggested some social plasticity. We investigated the sociospatial organization of a Mediterranean population of <b>Eurasian</b> <b>otters</b> by analyzing static and dynamic interactions among 15 individuals radiotracked during 3. 5 years in Alentejo (southern Portugal). Contrary to what is described in the literature and expected for solitary animals, otter dyads showed positive interactions, with individuals associating more often than expected by chance. Moreover, otter movement patterns were correlated. Finally, otters shared diurnal resting sites more often than expected. Adult males and females with cubs overlapped spatially and temporally, even sharing resting sites when the males had no paternity. Nonrelated otter dyads of opposite sex overlapped home ranges and core areas. Ranges of males overlapped with those of 1 – 3 females, whereas dyads {{of the same sex}} exhibited almost no overlap, confirming the classic mustelid intrasexual territoriality and a polygynous mating system (nevertheless, suspicions of female polyandry arose). On average, overlap of home ranges was higher than that of home-range cores. Our results contradict several statements in the literature on European otter sociality and reproductive behavior. We conclude that <b>Eurasian</b> <b>otters</b> are more social than previously thought, adding further evidence that social behavior in solitary carnivores may reveal significant flexibility...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the second}} report on the {{findings}} of a collaborative study between the Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS) and the Cardiff University Otter Project (CUOP). The study analysed the concentrations of 15 metals and semi-metals in the livers of 50 <b>Eurasian</b> <b>otters</b> (Lutra lutra) that had been found dead between 2007 and 2009 and collected by the CUOP. This report specifically presents data for otters found dead in 2009. The aim of this work was to determine the current concentrations of inorganic elements accumulated by otters and whether exposure to heavy metals (lead, mercury, cadmium) in particular is likely to be associated with adverse effects. The otters that were analysed were from England and Wales and included adult and sub-adult males and females. Liver tissue was analysed using Inductively Coupled Plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) techniques. The concentrations of inorganic elements measured {{in the present study were}} within the range previously reported for <b>Eurasian</b> <b>otters</b> in Britain and elsewhere in Europe. Concentrations varied with age and/or sex for some elements. For the heavy metals mercury and cadmium, liver concentrations generally increased with age. Five elements, aluminium, antimony, arsenic, chromium, and strontium, varied significantly in concentrations between years. It is unclear whether the inter-year variations in these elements represent significant inter-year changes in exposure and/or accumulation or may simply reflect local-scale variation in the provenance of otters and their associated exposure. The liver concentrations of the heavy metals mercury and cadmium in all the otters analysed were below those associated with toxic effects in mammals. ...|$|R
