5|$|Scully debriefs the FBI {{panel and}} {{explains}} that Mulder {{was a victim}} of an elaborate conspiracy and that she was given a fatal disease by someone in the room. As she is about to present her evidence, her nose bleeds and she collapses. Mulder brings the vial he found to the Lone Gunmen, who tell him it is not a cure, only <b>deionized</b> water.|$|E
5|$|Cannon {{recovered}} from the sea are often extensively damaged from exposure to salt water; because of this, electrolytic reduction treatment is required to forestall the process of corrosion. The cannon is then washed in <b>deionized</b> water to remove the electrolyte, and is treated in tannic acid, which prevents further rust and gives the metal a bluish-black colour. After this process, cannons on display may be protected from oxygen and moisture by a wax sealant. A coat of polyurethane may also be painted over the wax sealant, to prevent the wax-coated cannon from attracting dust in outdoor displays.|$|E
5|$|The {{controllers}} {{were designed}} to be tough enough to survive the forces of launch, and proved to be extremely resilient to damage. During {{the investigation of the}} Challenger accident the two MECs (from engines 2020 and 2021), recovered from the seafloor, were delivered to Honeywell Aerospace for examination and analysis. One controller was broken open on one side, and both were severely corroded and damaged by marine life. Both units were disassembled and the memory units flushed with <b>deionized</b> water. After they were dried and vacuum baked, data from these units was retrieved for forensic examination.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{concerns}} over atmospheric pollution and hazardous waste disposal, the electronics {{industry has been}} gradually shifting from rosin flux to water-soluble flux, which can be removed with <b>deionized</b> water and detergent, instead of hydrocarbon solvents.|$|E
25|$|As the {{reaction}} is exothermic, the installation is called an HCl oven or HCl burner. The resulting hydrogen chloride gas is absorbed in <b>deionized</b> water, resulting in chemically pure hydrochloric acid. This reaction can give a very pure product, e.g. {{for use in the}} food industry.|$|E
25|$|Dielectric fluid {{is used as}} {{a cutting}} fluid in {{electrical}} discharge machines (EDMs). It is usually <b>deionized</b> water or a high-flash-point kerosene. Intense heat is generated by the cutting action of the electrode (or wire) and the fluid is used to stabilise the temperature of the workpiece, along with flushing any eroded particles from the immediate work area. The dielectric fluid is non-conductive.|$|E
25|$|An article {{published}} in Journal of Environmental Monitoring in April 2012 concludes that antimony concentration in <b>deionized</b> water stored in PET bottles stays within EU's acceptable limit even if stored briefly at temperatures up to 60°C (140°F), while bottled contents (water or soft drinks) may occasionally exceed the EU limit after {{less than a year}} of storage at room temperature.|$|E
25|$|Three {{experimental}} studies were conducted that demonstrate a threshold for acute gastrointestinal upset of approximately 4–5nbsp&mg/L in healthy adults, {{although it is}} not clear from these findings whether symptoms are due to acutely irritant effects of copper and/or to metallic, bitter, salty taste. In an experimental study with healthy adults, the average taste threshold for copper sulfate and chloride in tap water, <b>deionized</b> water, or mineral water was 2.5–3.5nbsp&mg/L. This is just below the experimental threshold for acute gastrointestinal upset.|$|E
25|$|Water {{sensitive}} {{objects are}} masked {{in plastic wrap}} to avoid getting wet. A slurry of precipitated (pharmaceutical grade) calcium carbonate and <b>deionized</b> water is created and rubbed onto the silver piece with a cotton rag or cotton ball. It is recommended that the slurry be tested on the bottom or in a non-visible area of the silver for abrasiveness. If the slurry is too abrasive it will scratch the surface and increase the potential for future tarnishing. The polish is applied with a soft cloth and polished in a circular motion.|$|E
25|$|Electrodeionization: Water {{is passed}} between a {{positive}} electrode and a negative electrode. Ion exchange membranes allow only positive ions to migrate from the treated water toward the negative electrode and only negative ions toward the positive electrode. High purity <b>deionized</b> water is produced continuously, similar to ion exchange treatment. Complete removal of ions from water is possible {{if the right}} conditions are met. The water is normally pre-treated with a reverse osmosis unit to remove non-ionic organic contaminants, and with gas transfer membranes to remove carbon dioxide. A water recovery of 99% is possible if the concentrate stream is fed to the RO inlet.|$|E
25|$|Coherent {{microwave}} amplifiers operating above 1,000 watts microwave output, like {{travelling wave}} tubes and klystrons, require liquid coolant. The electron beam must contain 5 to 10 times {{more power than}} the microwave output, which can produce enough heat to generate plasma. This plasma flows from the collector toward the cathode. The same magnetic focusing that guides the electron beam forces the plasma {{into the path of}} the electron beam but flowing in the opposite direction. This introduces FM modulation which degrades Doppler performance. To prevent this, liquid coolant with minimum pressure and flow rate is required, and <b>deionized</b> water is normally used in most high power surface radar systems that utilize Doppler processing.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the very}} high power levels involved, large lamps are water-cooled. In those used in IMAX projectors, the {{electrode}} bodies are made from solid Invar and tipped with thoriated tungsten. An O-ring seals off the tube, so that the naked electrodes do not contact the water. In low power applications the electrodes are too cold for efficient electron emission and are not cooled; in high power applications an additional water cooling circuit for each electrode is necessary. To save costs, the water circuits are often not separated and the water needs to be <b>deionized</b> to make it electrically non-conductive, which, in turn, lets the quartz or some laser media dissolve into the water.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{is the process}} that was used when rescuing frescoes in La Fenice, a Venetian opera house, but the same process {{can be used for}} similarly damaged frescoes. First, a protection and support bandage of cotton gauze and polyvinyl alcohol is applied. Difficult sections are removed with soft brushes and localized vacuuming. The other areas that are easier to remove (because they had been damaged by less water) are removed with a paper pulp compress saturated with bicarbonate of ammonia solutions and removed with <b>deionized</b> water. These sections are strengthened and reattached then cleansed with base exchange resin compresses and the wall and pictorial layer were strengthened with barium hydrate. The cracks and detachments are stopped with lime putty and injected with an epoxy resin loaded with micronized silica.|$|E
25|$|Since modern {{thyristors}} {{can switch}} {{power on the}} scale of megawatts, thyristor valves have become the heart of high-voltage direct current (HVDC) conversion either to or from alternating current. In the realm of this and other very high-power applications, both electrically triggered (ETT) and light-triggered (LTT) thyristors are still the primary choice. The valves are arranged in stacks usually suspended from the ceiling of a transmission building called a valve hall. Thyristors are arranged into a diode bridge circuit and to reduce harmonics are connected in series to form a 12-pulse converter. Each thyristor is cooled with <b>deionized</b> water, and the entire arrangement becomes one of multiple identical modules forming a layer in a multilayer valve stack called a quadruple valve. Three such stacks are typically mounted on the floor or hung from the ceiling of the valve hall of a long-distance transmission facility.|$|E
25|$|Consistent with {{principles}} of good laboratory practice, calibration is performed {{with at least}} two standard buffer solutions that span the range of pH values to be measured. For general purposes, buffers at pH 4.00 and pH 10.00 are suitable. The pH meter has one calibration control to set the meter reading equal to the value of the first standard buffer and a second control to adjust the meter reading to the value of the second buffer. A third control allows the temperature to be set. Standard buffer sachets, available from a variety of suppliers, usually document the temperature dependence of the buffer control. More precise measurements sometimes require calibration at three different pH values. Some pH meters provide built-in temperature-coefficient correction, with temperature thermocouples in the electrode probes. The calibration process correlates the voltage produced by the probe (approximately 0.06volts per pH unit) with the pH scale. Good laboratory practice dictates that, after each measurement, the probes are rinsed with distilled water or <b>deionized</b> water to remove any traces of the solution being measured, blotted with a scientific wipe to absorb any remaining water, which could dilute the sample and thus alter the reading, and then immersed in a storage solution suitable for the particular probe type.|$|E
500|$|Construction of the Perkin-Elmer mirror {{began in}} 1979, {{starting}} with a blank manufactured by Corning from their ultra-low expansion glass. To keep the mirror's weight to a minimum it consisted of top and bottom plates, each one inch (25.4mm) thick, sandwiching a honeycomb lattice. Perkin-Elmer simulated microgravity by supporting the mirror from the back with 130 rods that exerted varying amounts of force. This ensured that the mirror's final shape would be correct and to specification when finally deployed. Mirror polishing continued until May 1981. NASA reports at the time questioned Perkin-Elmer's managerial structure, and the polishing began to slip behind schedule and over budget. To save money, NASA halted work on the back-up mirror and put the launch date of the telescope back to October 1984. The mirror was completed {{by the end of}} 1981; it was washed using 2,400 gallons (9,100 L) of hot, <b>deionized</b> water and then received a reflective coating of [...] 65nm-thick aluminum and a protective coating of 25nm-thick magnesium fluoride.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{water-cooled}} tube, the {{anode voltage}} appears {{directly on the}} cooling water surface, thus requiring the water to be an electrical insulator to prevent [...] high voltage leakage through the cooling water to the radiator system. Water as usually supplied has ions which conduct electricity; <b>deionized</b> water, a good insulator, is required. Such systems usually have a built-in water-conductance monitor which will shut down the high-tension supply if the conductance [...] becomes too high.|$|E
2500|$|Ethyl {{alcohol is}} {{sometimes}} {{added to the}} slurry mixture to help dry out excess water. [...] The slurry mixture is applied throughout the piece until completely polished. Dark tarnish spots are sometimes located {{on the surface and}} may need to be polished more than once to remove. Over polishing is an issue with silver and can cause harm {{to the surface of the}} metal. After polishing, the silver object is rinsed in <b>deionized</b> water and dried with a cotton cloth.|$|E
2500|$|The water clock has two pumps in the {{basement}} – one that keeps the clock working, and a backup in case the first fails. The [...] of fluid in the clock is not pure water. It is composed of <b>deionized</b> water (to keep it electrically unconductive), coloring (to make the water easier to see), and methyl alcohol (to keep bacteria from growing in the clock). The color of the water can be changed by stopping the clock, draining the water, {{and replacing it with}} water of the new color.|$|E
2500|$|For high-aspect-ratio {{structures}} the resist-developer {{system is}} required to have a ratio of dissolution rates in the exposed and unexposed areas of 1000:1.

[...] [...] This developer provides the required ratio of dissolution rates and reduces stress-related cracking from swelling in comparison to conventional PMMA developers. [...] After development, the substrate is rinsed with <b>deionized</b> water and dried either in a vacuum or by spinning. [...] At this stage, the PMMA structures can be released as the final product (e.g., optical components) or can be used as molds for subsequent metal deposition.|$|E
2500|$|In ceramics/glazing applications, calcium {{carbonate}} {{is known as}} whiting, and is a common ingredient for many glazes in its white powdered form. When a glaze containing this material is fired in a kiln, the whiting acts as a flux material in the glaze. Ground {{calcium carbonate}} is an abrasive (both as scouring powder and as an ingredient of household scouring creams), in particular in its calcite form, which has the relatively low hardness level of 3 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness, and will therefore not scratch glass and most other ceramics, enamel, bronze, iron, and steel, and have a moderate effect on softer metals like aluminium and copper. [...] A paste made from calcium carbonate and <b>deionized</b> water {{can be used to}} clean tarnish on silver.|$|E
