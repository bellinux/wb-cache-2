40|$|We generalize the <b>hierarchy</b> <b>construction</b> to generic 2 + 1 D {{topological order}}s (which can be non-Abelian) by {{condensing}} Abelian anyons in one topological {{order to construct}} a new one. We show that such construction is reversible and leads to a new equivalence relation between topological orders. We refer to the corresponding equivalence class (the orbit of the <b>hierarchy</b> <b>construction)</b> as “the non-Abelian family. ” Each non-Abelian family has {{one or a few}} root topological orders with the smallest number of anyon types. All the Abelian topological orders belong to the trivial non-Abelian family whose root is the trivial topological order. We show that Abelian anyons in root topological orders must be bosons or fermions with trivial mutual statistics between them. The classification of topological orders is then greatly simplified, by focusing on the roots of each family: those roots are given by non-Abelian modular extensions of representation categories of Abelian groups.
