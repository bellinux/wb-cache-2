[...] The basic principles evidently {{draw from the}} early AAUP statement on governance. [...] Though the NEA {{makes no mention of}} students anywhere in the policy, the NEA like the AAUP does reflect the basic ideas and premise for the “responsibility primarily of the faculty to determine the appropriate curriculum and procedures of student instruction”. [...] In this respect, the AAUP grants that considerations should be made for publicly supported institutions. [...] Unlike the NEA, the AAUP elaborates more on the role of governing structures, including the role of the president to ensure [...] "sound academic practices", as the NEA suggests faculty rights to appeal flawed and improper procedures. In summation, where the AAUP discusses the organizational structure for <b>governance</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> in more detail while touching on student involvement, the NEA statement differs by detailing primarily faculty rights and responsibilities in shared governance.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This paper reviews prior {{definitions}} of the umbrella term 2 ̆ 7 clinical governance 2 ̆ 7. The research question is: do clinical governance definitions adequately distinguish between <b>governance,</b> <b>management</b> <b>and</b> practice functions? Three definitions are introduced to replace that umbrella term. Design/Methodology/Approach: Content analysis is applied to analyse twenty nine {{definitions of}} clinical governance {{from the perspective of}} the roles and responsibilities of those charged with <b>governance,</b> <b>management</b> <b>and</b> practice. Findings: The analysis indicates that {{definitions of the}} umbrella term 2 ̆ 7 clinical governance 2 ̆ 7 comprise a mixture of activities relating to <b>governance,</b> <b>management</b> <b>and</b> practice which is confusing for those expected to execute those roles. Practical implications: Consistent with concepts from corporate governance, we distinguish between <b>governance,</b> <b>management</b> <b>and</b> practice. For effective governance, it is important that there be division of duties between <b>governance</b> roles <b>and</b> <b>management</b> <b>and</b> practice roles. These distinctions will help to clarify roles and responsibilities in the execution of clinical activities. Originality/Value:  Drawing on insights from corporate governance, in particular, the importance of a division of functions between <b>governance</b> roles, <b>and</b> <b>management</b> <b>and</b> practice roles, we propose three new definitions to replace the umbrella term 2 ̆ 7 clinical governance 2 ̆ 7...|$|R

The aim of this paper is to provide insight into corporate <b>governance</b> <b>and</b> risk <b>management</b> from a South African perspective. South Africa is regarded as one of the more advanced countries in Africa, although still an emerging country with huge development potentials. However, should corporate <b>governance</b> <b>and</b> risk <b>management</b> principles be lacking and not adequately developed and implemented, the aforementioned potential will be nullified and could negatively affect the economic growth and well-being of the country...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} investigates how corporate <b>governance</b> <b>and</b> risk <b>management</b> {{in financial}} industry affects {{the performance of}} companies. This study distinguishes between the pre-crisis and post-crisis periods {{to determine whether the}} global financial crisis of 2008 significantly affects corporate <b>governance</b> <b>and</b> risk <b>management</b> of financial industry. In addition, this research also tests how the effects of corporate <b>governance</b> <b>and</b> risk <b>management</b> factors on the performance of banks and insurance companies changed after the financial crisis. The study focuses on the 50 companies in the European union including banks and insurance companies. The study measures the profitability of companies through ROA. Risk management factors are the size of a risk committee in relation to board size and the presence of a Chief Risk Officer. Corporate governance factor is board structure measured as board independence. Besides, the mode incorporates leverage, size, industry, and loan to assets variables. The findings demonstrate that corporate <b>governance</b> <b>and</b> risk <b>management</b> were not associated with the profitability of financial institutions {{both before and after the}} global financial crisis. The effects were captured only for control variables such as size, leverage, and loan to assets ratio. The result shows that all these factors negatively affected ROA. Moreover, banks faced lower ROA ratios than insurance companies. This study also shows that corporate <b>governance</b> <b>and</b> risk <b>management</b> characteristics significantly changed after the financial crisis. More companies tend to include a CRO in their structure, having more independent boards, and increase the size of their risk management committees...|$|R
