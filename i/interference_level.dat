50|$|In the uplink of {{a spread}} {{spectrum}} cellular system, the carrier-to-interference ratio (CIR) is held constant {{by the power}} control for all users. For a user that suffers from high path loss, the power control will cause high <b>interference</b> <b>level</b> to signals from other users. This will prevent other more efficient data flows, since there is a maximum allowed <b>interference</b> <b>level</b> in the cell, and reduce the throughput. Consequently, for maximum throughput scheduling, data flows that suffer from high path loss {{should be considered as}} the most expensive, also in this case.|$|E

5000|$|In {{packet radio}} {{systems such as}} GPRS/EDGE, it is {{possible}} to combine DTX with capacity increase when VoIP is used for telephony.

40|$|A {{physically}} active lifestyle has beneficial effects on hippocampal memory function. A potential mechanism for {{this effect is}} exercise-enhanced hippocampal plasticity, particularly in the dentate gyrus (DG). Within hippocampal memory formation, the DG {{plays a crucial role}} in pattern separation, which is the ability to discriminate among similar experiences. Computational models propose a theoretical hypothesis that enhanced DG-mediated pattern separation leads to “memory flexibility”–a selective improvement in the ability to overcome moderate <b>levels</b> of mnemonic <b>interference.</b> Thus, in the current cross-sectional study of healthy young adults, we tested the working hypothesis that aerobic fitness, as a physiological indicator of endurance capacity associated with physical activity, is strongly associated with mnemonic discrimination at moderate <b>interference</b> <b>levels.</b> When divided the sample (n[*]=[*] 75) based on a median split of aerobic fitness, the higher fitness group had better discrimination performance for moderate <b>interference</b> <b>levels</b> compared to the lower fitness group, namely, exhibited memory flexibility. Moreover, aerobic fitness levels were positively associated with discrimination performance for moderate <b>interference</b> <b>levels,</b> as a mediator of physical activity effects. This evidence suggests that aerobic fitness levels are associated with hippocampal DG-related memory, which is consistent with literature showing positive effect of physical exercise on hippocampal memory...|$|R
5000|$|Proportional {{fairness}} can {{be achieved}} by setting the weights to , where [...] is the cost per data bit of data flow [...] For example in CDMA spread spectrum cellular networks, the cost may be the required energy (the <b>interference</b> <b>level),</b> and in dynamic channel allocation systems, the cost may be the number of nearby base station sites that can not use the same frequency channel, in view to avoid co-channel interference.|$|E
50|$|In some {{communications}} channels (for example, {{in power}} lines), noise and interference may be non-stationary and might vary synchronously with the 50 or 60 Hz AC current cycle. In scenarios like this, overall system performance {{can be improved}} if the MAC can get information from the PHY regarding when and how the noise and <b>interference</b> <b>level</b> is changing, so that the MAC can schedule transmission during the periods of time in which noise and interference levels are lower.|$|E
50|$|As a consequence, {{the signal}} {{at one of}} the {{received}} single-polarization terminals actually contains a dominant quantity of the desired signal (meant to be transmitted onto one polarization) and a minor amount of undesired signal (meant to be transported by the other polarization), which represents an interference over the former. As a consequence, each received signal must be cleared of the <b>interference</b> <b>level</b> in order to reach the required signal-to-noise-and-interference ratio (SNIR) needed by the receiving stages, which may be of the order of more than 30 dB for high-level M-QAM schemes. Such operation is carried out by a cross-polarization-interference cancellation (XPIC), typically implemented as a baseband digital stage.|$|E

50|$|Spread {{spectrum}} can {{be considered}} as an alternative to complex DCA algorithms. Spread spectrum avoids cochannel interference between adjacent cells, since the probability that users in nearby cells use the same spreading code is insignificant. Thus the frequency channel allocation problem is relaxed in cellular networks based on a combination of spread spectrum and FDMA, for example IS95 and 3G systems. Spread spectrum also facilitate that centrally controlled base stations dynamically borrow resources from each other depending on the traffic load, simply by increasing the maximum allowed number of simultaneous users in one cell (the maximum allowed <b>interference</b> <b>level</b> from the users in the cell), and decreasing it in an adjacent cell. Users in the overlap between the base station coverage area can be transferred between the cells (called cell-breathing), or the traffic can be regulated by admission control and traffic-shaping.|$|E
50|$|A newer {{rating is}} the Speech Privacy Class (ASTM E2638-08); {{it applies to}} closed rooms. PI {{is a measure of}} the speech from a talker at a {{specific}} location to a listener at a specific position. It is applicable to situations such as open offices as well useful for evaluating the efficacy of a listening device hidden in a stud wall. SPC makes use of average values so is very useful in the design and evaluation of closed rooms for speech privacy from casual listeners. There are several other measures such as, Speech Privacy Potential (SPP), Speech Intelligibility Index (SII), Speech Transmission Index (STI), Speech <b>Interference</b> <b>Level</b> (SIL) and Speech Intelligibility Contrast (SIC). Discussion and definitions of these ratings can be found in the literature. The advantage of the Privacy Index is that comparison of that rating to school grades makes the designer and user feel more comfortable with the rating; some of the others are more technical.|$|E
50|$|If FCA is {{combined}} with conventional FDMA and perhaps or TDMA, a fixed number of voice channels can be transferred over the cell. A new call can only be connected by an unused channel. If all the channel are occupied than the new call is blocked in this system. There are however several dynamic radio-resource management schemes that can be combined with FCA. A simple form is traffic-adaptive handover threshold, implying that calls from cell phones situated in the overlap between two adjacent cells can be forced to make the handover to the cell with the lowest load for the moment. If FCA {{is combined}} with spread spectrum, {{the maximum number of}} channels is not fixed in theory, but in practice a maximum limit is applied, since too many calls would cause too high co-channel <b>interference</b> <b>level,</b> causing the quality to be problematic. Spread spectrum allows cell breathing to be applied, by allowing an overloaded cell to borrow capacity (maximum number of simultaneous calls in the cell) from a nearby cell that is sharing the same frequency.|$|E

The computation of interference effects in a typical right-of-way is a complex and time-consuming procedure. This paper discusses an automated approach to analyze AC induced interference. All relevant parameters used for modeling the right-of-way {{are taken into account}} in computing the line parameters, building the circuit model, and automatically determining the maximum <b>interference</b> <b>levels</b> under steady-state and fault conditions at all specified locations.

30|$|The {{pseudo code}} of the TLS {{algorithm}} is presented in Algorithm 2. It is used for selecting the tuple link l_pi^x that brings minimum interference to the tuple links in H_ 0 ^t. Line 1 examines the initial conditions for each selection. The algorithm starts when the transmitter and receiver own idle radios. Line 2 selects the tuple link l_pi^x with minimum interference to the tuple links in H_ 0 ^t according to the cumulative <b>interference</b> <b>level</b> I_qj^y. With different l_pi^x∉H_ 0 ^t, it calculates the cumulative <b>interference</b> <b>level</b> I_qj^y for each tuple link l_qj^y in H_ 0 ^t∪{l_pi^x} and obtains the maximum value. Thus, it gets a maximum cumulative <b>interference</b> <b>level</b> set. The tuple link l_pi^x_ 0 corresponding to the smallest value in the maximum cumulative <b>interference</b> <b>level</b> set will be selected. Line 3 gets the maximum cumulative <b>interference</b> <b>level</b> of links in H_ 0 ^t∪{l_pi^x_ 0 }. Line 4 is a SINR condition to guarantee concurrent transmissions.
