25|$|Mario Cardullo's device, {{patented}} on January 23, 1973, was {{the first}} true ancestor of modern RFID, {{as it was a}} passive radio transponder with memory. The initial device was passive, powered by the interrogating signal, and was demonstrated in 1971 to the New York Port Authority and other potential users and consisted of a transponder with 16 bit memory for use as a toll device. The basic Cardullo patent covers the use of RF, sound and light as transmission media. The original business plan presented to investors in 1969 showed uses in transportation (automotive vehicle identification, automatic toll system, electronic license plate, electronic manifest, vehicle routing, vehicle performance monitoring), banking (<b>electronic</b> <b>check</b> book, electronic credit card), security (personnel identification, automatic gates, surveillance) and medical (identification, patient history).|$|E

Checks that have been verified may come back after the clearing time as “insufficient funds”, meaning that the consumer does not have sufficient funds in their account to pay the balance of the transaction.|$|R

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of the Internet and information technology, electronic commerce sys-tem is flourishing. In electronic commerce, customers use electronic money (e-money) instead of cash. E-money in wide use includes <b>electronic</b> cash, <b>electronic</b> <b>checks,</b> <b>electronic</b> coupons, and so on. E-money is fixed at face-value and is backed by banks. The fact that e-money is not issued in the actual amount to be used, it is somewhat inconvenient for customers to use. In addition, security requirements consume huge amounts of computing resources. Limited computing capability makes {{it is difficult to}} engage in electronic commerce with mobile devices. This study presents a new pay-ment system, wherein customers are not required to purchase e-money of a fixed value in advance. The amount of every transaction is deducted directly from the customer’s bank account, eliminating the inconvenience of fixed value currency, and reducing online computing requirements. Through the application of trapdoor hash functions to streamline computational processes, the system can be used with mobile devices. We have named the system, mobile banking payment system...|$|R
