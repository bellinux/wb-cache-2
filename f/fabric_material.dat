5|$|Newspapers {{reported}} that Myers had {{a monopoly on}} the making of hydrogen gas balloons and was the only producer in the United States of these balloons for the government. A loft in the Myers house was made available for a sewing area of balloon materials to make the large balloons. The <b>fabric</b> <b>material</b> was patterned, sewed together into large strips, and made ready for varnishing. He had a patent of a fabric made from sea island cotton that {{was used for the}} varnish application. Myers' patented varnish formula made the fabric impervious to hydrogen. The varnish used to seal the <b>fabric</b> <b>material</b> for the balloon envelopes was prepared in a low pit outdoors in a ravine behind the house. This was below ground level so the fabric being prepared was sheltered from the wind. It also provided a fire-pit in case the flammable material caught on fire. There was a water-hose handy for putting out a fire.|$|E

Some individuals may want to use common fabric ma-terials for respiratory protection because of shortage or affordability reasons. To address the filtration performance of common <b>fabric</b> <b>materials</b> against nano-size particles including vi-ruses, five major categories of <b>fabric</b> <b>materials</b> including sweatshirts, T-shirts, towels, scarves, and cloth masks were tested for polydisperse and monodisperse aerosols (20 – 1000 nm) at two different face velocities (5. 5 and 16. 5 cm s 21) and compared with the penetration levels for N 95 respirator filter media. The results showed that cloth masks and other <b>fabric</b> <b>materials</b> tested in the study had 40 – 90 % instantaneous penetration levels against polydisperse NaCl aerosols em-ployed in the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health particulate respirator test protocol at 5. 5 cm s 21.
