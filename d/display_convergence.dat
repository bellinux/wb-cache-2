40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} OECD countries are characterised {{by a high}} degree of stability of their export specialisation patterns at the country level or not. Furthermore, we test whether the countries have become more or less specialised. In this context we distinguish between specialisation (or de-specialisation) in trade patterns on the one hand, and divergence (or, on the contrary, convergence) on the other. A specialisation process refers to a process in which specialisation intra-country becomes more dispersed (and counter-wise for de-specialisation). In contrast, a divergence process refers to a process in which countries become more different in terms of specialisation in a particular sector, across countries (and counter-wise for convergence). We examine the sensitivity for the level of aggregation, and we apply a period of nearly three decades from 1965 to 1992. Twenty OECD countries are considered. The intra-country results show that the national specialisation patterns are rather sticky, although there is a tendency for countries to de-specialise in the medium to long term. The sector-wise results <b>display</b> <b>convergence</b> both in terms of β-and σ-convergence.

During a period of nearly three decades from 1965 to 1992, 20 OECD countries are examined. In addition we test whether the countries, have become more or less specialised in terms of trade specialisation in the period in question. In order to fulfill these aims we examine the sensitivity for, firstly; the level of aggregation, and secondly; the kind of statistical methodology applied. In this context we distinguish between specialisation (or despecialisation) in trade patterns on the one hand, and divergence (or on the contrary convergence) in trade patterns on the other. A specialisation process refers to a process in which specialisation intra-country becomes more dispersed (and counter-wise for de-specialisation).

The results show that elements of ‘stickiness’ and incremental change are combined for what concerns the intra-country analysis.

ETS induced calcium transients in a subset of neurons: 52. 2 % responded to oral ETS, 65. 4 % to aboral ETS, and 71. 7 % to simultaneous oral and aboral ETS. A total of 41. 3 % of the neurons <b>displayed</b> <b>convergence</b> of oral and aboral ETS-induced responses. Responses could be reversibly blocked with TTX (10 (-) 6 M), demonstrating involvement of neuronal conduction, and by removal of extracellular calcium. omega-Conotoxin (5 x 10 (- 7) M) blocked the majority of responses and reduced the amplitude of residual responses by 45 %, indicating the involvement of N-type calcium channels. Staining for calbindin and calretinin did not reveal different response patterns in these immunohistochemically identified neurons.

40|$|Aim To {{assess whether}} eight traits of fish {{communities}} (species richness, three reproductive traits and four trophic traits) respond similarly to environmental gradients, and consequently <b>display</b> <b>convergence</b> between the lakes of France and north-east USA (NEUSA). Location 75 French and 168 north-east USA lakes. Methods The data encompass fish surveys, {{the assignment of}} species into reproductive and trophic guilds, and environmental variables characterizing the lakes and their catchments. The analytical procedure was adapted from the recommendations of Schluter (1986) [Ecology, 67, 1073 - 1085]. Results The comparison of the regional pools of lacustrine fishes indicated that NEUSA was about twice as speciose as France, mostly due to higher species turnover across lakes, although NEUSA lakes were consistently about 20 % more speciose than French lakes for a given surface area. Warmer environments were consistently inhabited by {{a higher proportion of}} phytophilous and guarder species than were colder lakes. Hence there was convergence in community reproductive traits. Conversely, {{there was no evidence of}} convergence in the trophic structure of lacustrine fish communities between regions. Main conclusions The influence of temperature on the availability and quality of spawning substrates appears to be a major constraint on present-day lacustrine fish communities. In parallel, phylogenetic constraints, past events such as the diversification of the North American fish fauna, and selective extinctions during Pleistocene glaciations and subsequent recolonizations contribute to explaining the dissimilarities between the communities of the two regions and differences in their relationship to the environment...|$|E
40|$|This thesis studies {{regional}} economic disparities both within individual {{countries as well}} as between countries. The main objective is to determine whether regional disparities converge automatically through time and, if this is not the rule, whether regional policies are needed. This thesis argues that disparities, far from converging automatically, can persist not only through time but also be affected by policies and external factors. The issue of convergence of regional incomes becomes significant when considering the case of integrated areas. In this thesis I study the potential effects that the deepening of MERCOSUR will have on disparities both between as well as within the member countries by focusing on Argentina and Brazil, the two largest countries within the area, up until the late 1990 s. In order to analyse disparities within integrated areas, the European Union will be considered as a frame of reference. I show that although regional policies appear to have favoured convergence, this has not been as significant as expected, particularly within the regions. In addition, Argentina and Brazil will be analysed, and I trace the origin of national disparities to late colonial times. Further, regional disparities within both countries have not shown any major trends towards convergence over the centuries. Moreover, political and macroeconomic factors do seem to have an incidence in the process of regional convergence within those countries. Also, different subperiods <b>display</b> <b>convergence</b> and divergence. Both the European Union experience {{as well as that of}} Argentina and Brazil indicate that disparities were not reduced automatically as neo-classical economics predict. I also refer to macroeconomic and political factors having an impact in the process of convergence, diverting these regions away from their convergence paths. Another important factor in the automatic process of convergence as described in neo-classical economics is the interregional mobility of factors. However, this does not seem to have been the case for either the European Union or Argentina and Brazil. The thesis seeks to provide an insight into how disparities evolve through time and its conclusions will not only be useful in terms of regional policy planning in Argentina and Brazil but also in the process of deepening in MERCOSUR and a possible Latin American integration. The comparison with the European Union experience provides a more general frame of reference for other integration schemes around the world. The conclusions should provide a better insight into the problem of unbalanced growth not only for individual countries but also for integrated areas...|$|E
40|$|Mapping protein {{phosphorylation}} in zebrafish development Reversible protein phosphorylation plays a {{key role}} in signaling processes that are vital for a cell and organism. It provides a rapid switch for protein activity as it often changes the conformation and function of a protein in the cell. Deregulation of kinase or phosphatase activity may lead to a disturbed balance and can result in inaccurate signaling. As a consequence protein phosphorylation and the elucidation of signaling pathways have received considerable attention over the past years. To date, various approaches have been successfully applied to in vitro cell systems; however in vivo data become essential to relate to physiological processes. Therefore we have explored the possibilities to use zebrafish development as a model system to study in vivo phosphorylation using mass spectrometry. Tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins at two different stages in zebrafish embryonic development was studied by immuno-affinity purification and multi-dimensional LC-MS. Tyrosine kinases including members of the Src family of kinases, Eph receptors and Focal adhesion kinase as well as adaptor proteins such as Paxillin, Crk and p 130 Cas were identified. Many differences in expression or phosphorylation state were observed for these two embryonic stages. In addition, multiplex in vitro kinase assays were performed, which confirmed most of the in vivo observations. The in vitro kinase chip technology was also used to determine protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity profiles from morpholino mediated knock down zebrafish embryo lysates. Morpholino knock down of the kinases Fyn and Yes, induced characteristic phenotypes in 1 day old zebrafish embryos and the lysates induced distinct changes in the PTK activity profiles compared to wild-type lysates. Previously it was shown that Wnt 11 knock down phenocopied Fyn and Yes knock down. Interestingly, Wnt 11 knock down induced similar changes in the PTK activity profile as Fyn/Yes knock down. An on-line TiO 2 based LC MS/MS was used to enrich for all phosphorylated peptides in 1 day old zebrafish embryo samples. We identified more than 1000 phosphorylation sites in 60 embryos. The phosphopeptide dataset was searched for known kinase motifs, using Scansite. This revealed predominant Cdk 5 kinase, p 38 MAPK, PKA and casein kinase 2 substrates in the dataset, indicating high kinase activity. Comparison with human datasets revealed surprising conservation of phosphorylation sites, suggesting specialized function. A quantitative proteomics approach, using stable isotope di-methyl labeling was used to compare protein phosphorylation between wild type and Fyn/Yes knockdown embryos that <b>display</b> <b>convergence</b> and extension cell movement defects. We detected differential phosphorylation of known regulators of gastrulation cell movements, including Gravin, PDLIM 5 and small GTPase regulators. In this thesis in vivo phosphorylation was studied at different stages and under different experimental conditions in developing zebrafish embryos. The results established zebrafish as a good model to study in vivo phosphorylation and reveal that surprising homology exists with human phosphoproteins. Taken together this research emphasizes the strength of mass spectrometry based phosphoproteomics in the elucidation of endogenous signaling pathways via the large scale identification of phosphoproteins and phosphorylation sites and the obtained results contribute to a better understanding of biological pathways and critical cellular processes...|$|E

40|$|Factor {{mobility}} {{plays an}} important role in the convergence of regional income levels. This paper examines the role of labor mobility in China's regional economic development in the context of phases of demographic transition and the existence of institutional barriers. Our findings show that the two most important sources of interregional income disparity are per worker capital stock and technology level. The fact that the richest provincial economies are at the later phase of demographic transition provides a major reason for why those economies have accumulated higher per worker capital stock and achieved higher productivity levels. We also discover that regional per capita income levels have not <b>displayed</b> <b>convergence</b> since the mid 1990 s. Two observations explain this phenomenon. One observation is that capital and labor movements have played only a limited role in equalizing their marginal returns across regions despite the fact that labor mobility has substantially strengthened this role since 2000. The other observation is that the impact of demographic changes on income growth has been distinctly uneven between the rich and poor regions. This phenomenon can be attributed to some particular features of China's interregional labor migration.
