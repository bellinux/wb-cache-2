In exchange, NTNF maintained the entire village and paid insurance on the buildings they used. Movable property used by NTNF was bought for a moderate price. NTNF had to build several new buildings in addition to utilities such as power cables and water, sewer and <b>heating</b> <b>pipes.</b> The new pipes had to be installed after the previous pipes, installed in 1956, had been subject to frost burst. Instead of building the pipes in a culvert, they were instead placed in wooded boxes above ground. During the summer of 1965, 65 people were working on construction, although it fell to between 40 and 45 during the winter. The following winter, only five people overwintered.|$|E

[...] A claim of cruelty against Barrett committed by the groupies and hangers-on who frequented his apartment during this period was described by writer and critic Jonathan Meades. [...] "I went [...] to see Harry and there was this terrible noise. It sounded like <b>heating</b> <b>pipes</b> shaking. I said, 'What's up?' and he sort of giggled and said, 'That's Syd having a bad trip. We put him in the linen cupboard'". Storm Thorgerson responded to this claim by stating [...] "I do not remember locking Syd up in a cupboard. It sounds to me like pure fantasy, like Jonathan Meades was on dope himself." [...] Other friends assert that Barrett's infamous flatmates, [...] "Mad Jock" [...] and [...] "Mad Sue," [...] believed that acid held all the answers and thought of Barrett as a genius or [...] "god," [...] and were spiking his morning coffee with LSD every day without his knowledge, leaving him in a never-ending trip. He was later rescued from that flat by friends and moved elsewhere, but his erratic behavior continued. Watkinson and Anderson included quotes from a story told to them by Thorgerson that underscored how volatile Barrett could be. [...] "On one occasion, I had to pull him off Lindsay (Barrett's girlfriend at the time) because he was beating her over the head with a mandolin". On one occasion, Barrett threw a woman called Gilly across the room, because she refused to go to Gilmour's house. These strange behaviors contradicted Barrett's usually gentle nature. According to Gilmour in an interview with Nick Kent, the other members of Pink Floyd approached psychiatrist R. D. Laing with the 'Barrett problem'. After hearing a tape of a Barrett conversation, Laing declared him [...] "incurable".|$|E
40|$|<b>Heat</b> <b>pipes</b> {{have been}} investigated, {{developed}} and applied in many industrial fields since 1964. However, <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> technology {{is still a}} relatively new topic in high heat flux environments such as are encountered in the metallurgical and energy industries. This study focused {{on the development of}} a novel <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> that can be used under high heat flux conditions. The state of the technology prior to this study was that <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> were not suitable for high heat flux applications. Even though numerous patents have been granted for <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> and related applications, most are based on the basic concepts of the conventional <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> as detailed in the literature. Researchers have found {{that there are a number}} of problems with these <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> when they are applied in high heat flux environments. Thus, it was a prime objective of this study to develop a novel <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> that is suitable for such high heat flux operations. In addition, some basic fundamental issues regarding the overall makeup of <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> were also investigated and explained. The fundamental study showed that the film boiling phenomenon can be a serious problem when a conventional <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> is used under high heat flux conditions. Film boiling can make a conventional <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> lose its ability for sustained heat transfer with a small temperature gradient. The flow modified <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> that was invented and studied eliminates film boiling in the evaporator of the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe.</b> In this kind of <b>heat</b> <b>pipe,</b> a flow-modifier element was introduced into the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> chamber to improve the heat transfer of the two-phase flow. The experimental data indicated that the flow modified <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> was dramatically better than a conventional <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> under a comparable high heat flux load. This novel <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> successfully combined the flow modified <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> and the loop <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> and, thus, effectively overcame film boiling by collapsing the formed films. It was shown that the novel <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> are suitable for high heat flux and high temperature operation where conventional <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> will only function at a fraction of the heat load...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1993 Conventional {{stainless}} steel - water and ceramic fabric composite water <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> {{have been built}} and tested. The tests have been conducted to compare the performance characteristics between conventional and fabric composite <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> radiators for space nuclear power heat rejection systems. The fabric composite concept combines a strong ceramic fabric with a thin metal liner to form a very lightweight <b>heat</b> <b>pipe.</b> The <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> tested have used identical, homogeneous fabric wicks and water as the working fluid. One fabric composite <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> has been constructed by fitting a braided aluminoborosilicate fabric tube over {{the outside of the}} conventional {{stainless steel}} <b>heat</b> <b>pipe.</b> A more advanced fabric composite design combines the woven fabric with a 0. 25 mm (10 mil) stainless steel tube as the liner, and reduces the mass of the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> by a factor of three.

40|$|A {{nitrogen}} <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> was designed, {{built and}} {{tested for the}} purpose of providing a thermal shunt between the two stages of a Gifford-McMahan (GM) cryocooler during cooldown. The nitrogen <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> has an operating temperature range between 63 and 123 K. While the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> is in the temperature range during the system cooldown, it acts as a thermal shunt {{between the first and second}} stage of the cryocooler. The <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> increases the <b>heat</b> transfer to the first stage of the cryocooler, thereby reducing the cooldown time of the system. When the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> temperature drops below the triple point, the nitrogen working fluid freezes, effectively stopping the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> operation. A small heat leak between cryocooler stages remains because of axial conduction along the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> wall.

The <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> are formed by extruding aluminum, and typically have an integral flange to increase the heat transfer area, which lowers the temperature drop. Grooved wicks {{are used in}} spacecraft, instead of the screen or sintered wicks used for terrestrial <b>heat</b> <b>pipes,</b> since the <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> don’t have to operate against gravity in space. This allows spacecraft <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> to be several meters long, in contrast to the roughly 25 cm maximum length for a water <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> operating on Earth.
