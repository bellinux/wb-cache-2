5000|$|Tilney St Lawrence {{is located}} within a large parish {{of the same}} name, {{situated}} in the West Norfolk Local Government District. The parish has an area of 2041 ha. The parish also contains the villages of Tilney St Lawrence, Tilney cum Islington and Islington. The parish that exists today used to be two separate parishes. They were Tilney St Lawrence and Tilney-cum-Islington which were combined in 1935 to form the fourth largest parish in the Marshland region. The name Tilney is thought to derive from the Old English for Tibba's homestead [...] and St Lawrence refers to {{the dedication of the}} village parish church. The name Islington is thought to derive from the Old English for enclosure of <b>Elesa's</b> people ...|$|R

Bowen and the other English prisoners managed to seize the ship's longboat, They sailed the 15 leagues (45 miles) to St. Augustine. Bowen remained at St. Augustine for the next 18 months before finally deciding to become a pirate himself. He joined the crew of Captain Read, being elected sailing master by the crew.|$|E
5000|$|The Wessex royal {{pedigree}} {{continued to}} puzzle historians until, in 1953, Anglo-Saxon scholar Kenneth Sisam presented an analysis {{that has since}} been almost universally accepted by historians. He noted similarities between the earlier versions of the Wessex pedigree and that of Ida. Those appearing in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and in the published transcript of Asser (the original having been lost in an 18th-century fire) are in agreement but several earlier manuscript transcripts of Asser's work give, instead, the shorter pedigree of the later Anglian collection manuscripts, probably representing the original text of Asser and the earliest form of the Cerdic pedigree. Sisam speculated that the additional names arose through the insertion {{of a pair of}} Saxon heroes, Freawine and Wig, into the existing pedigree, creating a second alliterative pair (after Brand/Bældæg, Giwis/Wig, where the stress of [...] "Giwis" [...] is on the second sylable) and inviting further alliteration, the addition of Esla to complete an Elesa/Esla pair, and of Friðgar to make a Freawine/Friðgar alliteration. Of these alliterative names (in a culture whose poetry depended upon alliteration rather than rhyme) only Esla is perhaps known elsewhere: British historians working before Sisam suggested that his name is that of Ansila, a legendary Goth ancestor or that he is Osla 'Bigknife' of Arthurian legend, an equivalency still followed by some Arthurian writers, although Osla is elsewhere identified with Octa of Kent. <b>Elesa</b> has also been linked to the Romano-Briton Elasius, the [...] "chief of the region" [...] met by Germanus of Auxerre.|$|E
40|$|Using the {{modelling}} tool <b>ELESA</b> (Econometric Lifestyle Environment Scenario Analysis), {{this paper describes}} forecast scenarios to 2030 for UK household expenditure and associated (direct and indirect) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for 16 expenditure categories. Using assumptions for real household disposable income, real prices, ‘exogenous non-economic factors’ (ExNEF), average UK temperatures and GHG intensities, three future scenarios are constructed. In each scenario, real expenditure for almost all categories of UK expenditure continues {{to grow up to}} 2030; the exceptions being ‘alcoholic beverages and tobacco’ and ‘other fuels’ (and ‘gas’ and ‘electricity’ in the ‘low’ scenario) leading to an increase in associated GHG emissions for most of the categories in the ‘reference’ and ‘high’ scenarios other than ‘food and non-alcoholic beverages’, ‘alcoholic beverages and tobacco’, ‘electricity’, ‘other fuels’ and ‘recreation and culture’. Of the future GHG emissions, about 30 % is attributed to ‘direct energy’ use by households and nearly 70 % attributable to ‘indirect energy’. UK policy makers therefore need to consider a range of policies if they wish to curtail emissions associated with household expenditure, including, for example, economic measures such as taxes alongside measures that reflect the important contribution of ExNEF to changes in expenditure for most categories of consumption...|$|E
