25|$|Bankhead {{received}} a Tony Award nomination for her {{performance of a}} bizarre 50-year-old mother in the short-lived Mary Coyle Chase play, Midgie Purvis (1961). It was a physically demanding role and Bankhead insisted on doing the stunts herself, including sliding down a staircase bannister. She received glowing reviews, but the play itself suffered from numerous rewrites and failed to last beyond a month. Her last theatrical appearance was in a revival of another Williams play, The Milk Train Doesn't Stop <b>Here</b> <b>Anymore</b> (1963), directed by Tony Richardson. She had suffered a severe burn on her right hand from a match exploding while she lit a cigarette, and it was aggravated by the importance of jewelery props in the play. She took heavy painkillers, but these dried her mouth, and most critics thought that Tallulah's line readings were unintelligible.

40|$|The shared frailty {{model is}} one of the popular tool to analyze {{correlated}} right-censored time-toevent data. In the shared frailty model, the latent frailty is assumed to be shared by the members of a cluster and is assigned a parametric distribution, typically, a gamma distribution due to its conjugacy. However, in case of interval-censored time-to-event data, the inclusion of gamma frailties results in complicated intractable likelihoods, where the conjugacy property does not hold <b>anymore.</b> <b>Here,</b> we propose a semiparametric Bayesian frailty model for analyzing such data. We discuss three parametric specifications for frailty distribution in the analysis of interval-censored data.

40|$|Much {{has been}} said about {{observability}} in system theory and control; however, it has been recently that observability in complex networks has seriously attracted the attention of researchers. This paper examines the state-of-the-art and discusses some issues raised due to "complexity" and "stochasticity". These unresolved issues call for a new practical methodology. For stochastic systems, a degree of observability may be defined and the observability problem is not a binary (i. e., yes-no) question <b>anymore.</b> <b>Here,</b> we propose to employ a goal-seeking system to play a supervisory role in the network. Hence, improving the degree of observability would be a valid objective for the supervisory system. Towards this goal, the supervisor dynamically optimizes the observation process by reconfiguring the sensory parts in the network. A cognitive dynamic system is suggested as a proper choice for the supervisory system. In this framework, the network itself is viewed as the environment with which the cognitive dynamic system interacts. Computer experiments confirm the potential of the proposed approach for addressing some of the issues raised in networks due to complexity and stochasticity. Comment: Submitted to IEEE Trans.

40|$|Mapping images – when words don’t work. My master {{essay is}} a walking contradiction. It is an {{explanation}} of how a non-wordly thought process emerged – but explained in words. Words have never been my strong suit and in my essay I try to illustrate how I use images instead of words, mapping instead of structure, to escape the dictatorship of the written explanation. Where words have a certain linear structure from A to B my thought process is instead a juxtaposed jumble of heterogeneous elements that together create different associations in a rhizomatic and non-structured way. When I begin a project it is always the images that guide my idea instead of the idea guiding my images. In this way I let myself be seduced by the non-explainable atmosphere of the images. Instead of explanations I collect the images in big maps that have no clear beginning, middle or end. I let the images speak to each other, compliment or contrast one another. For me {{this is a way}} of keeping my work open as long as possible. As I work with video and narrative structure in the final product, the juxtaposing of images is a way of postponing and contrasting the more closed process of editing on a linear timeline.   I have a strong belief in the power of images. The old cliché ‘a picture says more than a thousand words’ still works for me, specifically because they don’t have to explain themselves or be ‘literal’ (in the literal sense of the word). They allow me to dwell in atmospheres, non-logic connections and open questions. Together, the mapping of images doesn’t create one clear design for my work, but a heterogeneous multiplicity of potential works to come. Sooner or later I have {{to take control of the}} process and be the dictator of the images. But my experience have taught me, that the more I allow the images to speak for themselves in all their ambivalence, the more I can infuse my final work with the same ambivalence and open-endedness. My works are not answers, but questions. And the collection of images that guide my work process let me keep asking the questions that words cannot formulate. The essay grabbles with these themes of words, images and process. As an illustration of my process, the essay is accompanied by a visual map, where I have tried to explain the associations that the images create for the theme of my work. I haven’t escaped the dictatorship of words yet, but maybe given the images their proper place within my work process. A 4 channel video installation. Size on screens: 136 x 76 cm.

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} and investigates exact {{approaches to}} classical and practical capacitated lot sizing problems in petrochemical industries. The refinery provides {{a host of}} very challenging problems in production/procurement planning. Two typical production/procurement planning problems are investigated, which are single item capacitated lot sizing problems oriented refineries, and multi-item procurement planning problems in distributed supply chain with multi-suppliers, multi-refineries and multi-customs. Due to the characters in petrochemical products, the total demands are always more than production capacities. On the other side, even the total demands are less than production capacities, since the rule of meeting demands may lead to excessive inventory holding costs in some periods, it is cheaper to permit lost sales {{in order to get}} maximum profit. Furthermore, by analyzing the practical production/procurement planning on special cases in a refinery, the production capacity is high enough, but the reorder quantities are restricted by inventory capacity instead of production capacity. A single item dynamic lot size model with inventory capacity and lost sales is formulated. Subsequently, we extend a single item inventory capacity economic lot sizing model with lost sales to more general cost functions, which are concave functions. Stockout and conservation models are considered as well. Zero Inventory Order property cannot be used <b>anymore</b> <b>here.</b> Two strongly polynomial algorithms are developed based on some new properties, respectively. Some theoretical analyses for algorithms are performed. The computational results show that proposed approaches could get a satisfactory solution and has potential to practical production applications. Finally, by analyzing the crude oil procurement planning for distributed supply chain with multi-suppliers and multi-refineries, a purchasing problem originating from the purchase center as buyer’s point of view is described. The refineries outsource their crude oil procurement to purchase center for scale economies. A multi-objective procurement planning model is established, which not only minimizes supply chain cycle time, the total costs of earliness and tardiness penalties, production costs and transportation costs, but also considers quality and delivery on time. Through model transformation, the objective function can be solved by the general mathematical programming methods. The numerical computations demonstrates that the approach proposed is efficient and applicable, which can not only make effective procurement planning, minimize the cycle time of the supply chain，but also can choose the suppliers reasonably and optimize the configuration of resources...|$|R
