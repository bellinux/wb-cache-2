25|$|Because its {{monopoly}} licence {{granted by}} the British Government forbade any activity besides the fur trade, the HBC created the PSAC to sidestep this issue. The PSAC was formed to produce or manufacture enough agricultural and livestock products to meet the Russian supply demands. In correspondence with British officials, the PSAC was long touted {{as a means to}} promote the British position in the Oregon boundary dispute with the United States. <b>For</b> <b>years</b> <b>now</b> the British had insisted that the Pacific Northwest be partitioned along the Columbia River, rather than a westward extension of the 49th parallel. This would have left most of modern Washington state under British control, notably the important Puget Sound. Through its company stations, the PSAC would promote settlement by British subjects in this disputed area, although it largely failed in this particular aspect.|$|E

500|$|The A.V.

[...] His {{favorite part of the}} episode was when the two teams worked together; he gave particular attention to the Walter-Walternate talk, remarking, [...] "The last scene between the two Walters is something that I’ve been waiting to see <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>now,</b> and John Noble nails both sides of the conversation. It’s now one of the whole series’ signature moments: Walter and Walternate, side-by-side." [...] Other critics also lauded the conversation between Walter and Walternate over Peter.|$|E
500|$|Spielberg {{had already}} {{demonstrated}} {{his interest in}} World War II themes with the films 1941, Empire of the Sun, Schindler's List, and the Indiana Jones series. Spielberg later co-produced the World War II themed television miniseries Band of Brothers and its counterpart The Pacific with Tom Hanks. When asked about this by American Cinematographer, Spielberg said, [...] "I think that World War II {{is the most significant}} event of the last 100 years; the fate of the baby boomers and even Generation X was linked to the outcome. Beyond that, I've just always been interested in World War II. My earliest films, which I made when I was about 14 years old, were combat pictures that were set both on the ground and in the air. <b>For</b> <b>years</b> <b>now,</b> I've been looking for the right World War II story to shoot, and when Robert Rodat wrote Saving Private Ryan, I found it." ...|$|E
