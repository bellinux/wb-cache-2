By August 2017, preliminary work on the line was underway, and the engineering firm AKRF was updating the environmental impact study for Phase 2.

25|$|On November 21, 2016, the MTA {{requested}} that the Phase 2 project be entered into the Project Development phase under the Federal Transit Administration's New Starts program. On December 15, several elected officials for the area announced that they were seeking $6 billion of funding for Phase 2 of the line, including $2 billion from the federal government. These officials wished to secure funding from the presidential administration of Barack Obama before Obama's term ended on January 20, 2017. In their request for funding, they cited {{that they wanted to}} avoid an uncertain response from the administration of Donald Trump and start construction on Phase 2 as soon as possible. The FTA granted this request in late December 2016. Under the approved plan, the MTA would complete an environmental reevaluation by 2018, receive funding by 2020, and open Phase 2 between 2027 and 2029. On May 24, 2017, the MTA Board approved an amendment to the 2015–2019 Capital Program, and as part of it, the funding allocated to Phase 2 was increased by $700 million to a total of $1.735 billion.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Performance–Based <b>Grant</b> <b>Agreements</b> are {{increasingly}} being used in Nepal in the healthcare sector, especially at public-private partnership hospitals. As interest in these agreements grows, {{it is essential to}} understand the process of implementation so that Nepali healthcare policy–makers can make better informed decisions about how they impact the public health situation of Nepal. This project studied the process of implementing Performance–Based <b>Grant</b> <b>Agreements</b> using qualitative research methods to interview key informants about their opinions, perceptions, and experiences associated with these agreements. METHODS: Semi–structured interviews with open–ended questions were conducted with key informants who have direct knowledge and experience about the design, implementation, and impact of the Performance–Based <b>Grant</b> <b>Agreements.</b> The key informants included healthcare administrators and healthcare workers at the various implementing hospitals, Government of Nepal officials, and members of various External Development Partners; these participants were chosen using a combination of purposive and convenience sampling methods in an attempt to triangulate responses and to generate a diversity of opinions, and perspectives. Participants were asked about their experiences with the Performance–Based <b>Grant</b> <b>Agreements</b> and interviews focused on associated challenges, opportunities, learned experiences, and both expected and unexpected consequences. Data analysis was overlapping with data collection and concentrated on identifying recurrent themes and ideas from transcribed interviews. These themes and ideas along with illustrative quotes guided discussion and results. RESULTS: A total of 16 interviews, ranging from 12 minutes to 75 minutes in length, were conducted with different hospital administrators, Government of Nepal officials, and members of different External Development Partners about the Performance–Based <b>Grant</b> <b>Agreements.</b> Participants had widely varying experiences about the process of implementing these agreements, which yielded a diversity of responses. DISCUSSION: There was an awareness gradient among the participants about the agreements as some participants had barely heard of the contracts while others had detailed knowledge of how their institution was implementing them. The process of implementation for participants and their institutions included grappling with the concept of conditionally tying funding to performance, figuring out how to do monitoring and evaluation, understanding the barriers to implementation, and using new technology and practices {{to meet the demands of}} the agreements. Despite the varying experiences associated with implementation or a lack thereof, participants were unanimous in their support for the adoption of these agreements and hopeful that these agreements can enhance partnership while improving the delivery of health services in Nepal...|$|R
500|$|Metro {{construction}} required {{billions of}} federal dollars, originally provided by Congress {{under the authority}} of the National Capital Transportation Act of 1969 (Public Law 91-143).

This act was amended on January 3, 1980 by Public Law 96-184, [...] "The National Capital Transportation Amendment of 1979" [...] (also known as the Stark-Harris Act), which authorized additional funding of $1.7 billion to permit the completion of [...] of the system as provided under the terms of a full funding <b>grant</b> <b>agreement</b> executed with WMATA in July 1986, which required 20% to be paid from local funds.

500|$|In the end, Secretary Chao heeded the Republican letter's arguments, and {{deferred}} {{the grant}} {{in a letter}} written by FTA Executive Director Matthew Welbes to Caltrain which stated the FTA needed [...] "additional time to complete review of this significant commitment of Federal resources". Caltrain had expected Secretary Chao to approve the grant and sign the <b>grant</b> <b>agreement</b> by March 1, which is normally a pro forma step performed after the thirty-day comment period for a highly-rated project, and had already awarded construction contracts. Balfour Beatty Construction and Stadler Rail had already begun preparations to upgrade the existing tracks and build electrical trainsets, respectively. Caltrain negotiated an emergency four-month contract extension at a potential cost of $20 million. Under the preliminary budget proposal released in mid-March 2017, the United States Department of Transportation's Capital Investment Grant Program would be eliminated, although approved projects {{would continue to be}} funded.
