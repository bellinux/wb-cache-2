2500|$|At the {{motorcycle}} show in November 1951, Sharp's announced what they described as [...] "a revolutionary {{design in the}} field of commercial vehicles". [...] The Sharp's Commercial 3 Cwt took the concept of the Minicar's light, three-wheeled, utilitarian design, and adapted it as the basis for an open-top lightweight <b>industrial</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The yellow and black prototype at the show was powered by an Indian Brave [...] four-stroke side valve engine (supplied by Brockhouse Engineering Co., Southport) and mounted in a cradle ahead and above the front wheel. Though described as [...] "constructed on the stressed-skin principle", large cut outs to allow easy access from either side of the vehicle required much additional strengthening to the floor, with a central steel backbone girder, a cross member between the rear wheels and further triangular bracing. The single seat was located centrally as was the steering wheel. Steering was by worm and sector, and flared side panels allowed the single front wheel to turn a full 180°, making the vehicle extremely manoeuvrable. The entire engine, drive-train and steering unit could be removed by undoing four bolts to allow for easy servicing. Unlike the Minicar, there were brakes on all three wheels and there was a wooden-slatted floor behind the driver. Though the Sharp's Commercial never entered production, it served as a forerunner to van and pickup versions of the Mark B which appeared in 1952.|$|E

50|$|The {{company has}} {{its origins in}} the year 1892. The company's founder, Heinrich Schmitz, began to {{construct}} wagons at the family's forge located in Altenberge near Münster. The forge's new business first began to gain headway {{at the end of}} the 1920s as a result of increasing motorisation. During this time the company transformed from a craftsman's business into an <b>industrial</b> <b>vehicle</b> manufacturer. The first motor vehicle trailer equipped with solid rubber tyres was delivered in 1928. From 1935 onward semi-trailers and box vehicles with a steel exterior on a wooden frame were manufactured. In 1950 Schmitz Cargobull produced its first insulated and refrigerated body.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Currently, {{there is}} a clear trend to {{concentrate}} companies in industrial areas around urban centres. As a consequence of this there has been an increase of traffic produced by <b>industrial</b> <b>vehicles</b> that can even saturate the inputs or outputs of a city and sometimes can produce parking problems. Therefore, {{there is a}} tremendous necessity for searching park zones for these vehicles, whose capacity must be sized with accuracy. Estimations currently done on behalf of <b>industrial</b> <b>vehicles</b> calculations come from the number of vehicles at this time in a city, without any consideration about the future necessities of an urban centre. Transport flows can be forecasted with the use of new tools such as Artificial Neural Networks, considering growing trends of urban centres, by mean of which sizing of <b>industrial</b> <b>vehicles</b> park capacity can be done with accuracy. Therefore, the project goal pursues to demonstrate the use of Artificial Neural Networks, and particularly the back-propagation algorithm, as a potential tool for transport flows forecasting based on historical data, and finally the application to other areas inside the transport and logistics world, like <b>industrial</b> <b>vehicles</b> sizing. 1. Tool employed description: artificial neural networks Metaheuristics methods have been chosen for the prediction of <b>industrial</b> <b>vehicles</b> park sizing, which allow to solve hard problems or NP problems with low computing cost, giving at the same time several optimal solutions which is the main difference on behalf of statistics methods. In the group of metaheuristics methods, there are tools such as Genetic Algorithms and Artificial Neural Networks: • Genetic Algorithms are mainly based in the successive election of the strongest element, so {{that at the end of}} the iterations it only survives the strongest element of a population...|$|R
