25|$|This term at Meadowbank {{includes}} both {{old and new}} staff. Miss Chadwick helped Miss Bulstrode found the school. Miss Vansittart <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>teaching</b> there for several years, and Miss Rich for 18 months. Miss Johnson is the girls' matron. The new staff include Angèle Blanche (French teacher), Grace Springer (gym teacher), Ann Shapland (Miss Bulstrode's new secretary), and Adam Goodman (gardener). Miss Bulstrode is nearing retirement, and is deciding whom to appoint as her successor. Many assume Vansittart will be the successor. But Bulstrode is also considering Rich, who is young and has lots of ideas. She is not considering Chadwick, whom she believes to be too old. These deliberations are cut short when Miss Springer is shot dead in the Sports Pavilion late at night. Johnson and Chadwick discover her body.|$|E
25|$|As {{a student}} at the University of Texas School of Law in 1981, Garner began noticing odd usages in lawbooks—many of them dating back to Shakespeare. These became the source {{material}} for his first book, A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage. That book was published by Oxford University Press in 1987 and is now in its third edition (published in 2011 and retitled Garner's Dictionary of Legal Usage). Since 1990, his main work <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>teaching</b> seminars such as Advanced Legal Writing and Editing, Advanced Legal Drafting, and The Winning Brief. Garner has also created many online seminars on writing and advocacy. Since 2006, Garner has interspersed in his lectures numerous video clips from the dozens of judges he has interviewed on the art of writing and on advocacy. In 2006–2007, he interviewed eight of the nine Justices of the United States Supreme Court. Since then, he has interviewed a ninth: Justice Elena Kagan. All his Supreme Court interviews are available online. When these interviews first appeared in print, they were featured {{on the front page of}} the New York Times. In addition, Garner has interviewed circuit judges on all the federal circuits. He has compiled an extensive archive of what American judges in the early 21st century say about effective writing and advocacy.|$|E

25|$|Kat visits Stacey for Christmas and {{discovers that}} Martin is not Arthur's father, urging Stacey {{to tell him}} the truth. As Stacey is about to do so, Kyle {{approaches}} her and formally introduces himself to her as her half-brother. After overhearing Kat talk to someone about a baby being stolen, Stacey fears for Arthur's safety and takes refuge in the church, where Dot Branning (June Brown), who <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>teaching</b> her about Christianity, finds her and tells her the story of the Massacre of the Innocents, causing Stacey to believe that Arthur is in danger. Believing people are trying to harm Arthur, Stacey unsuccessfully attempts to baptise Arthur through Dot's sink. She discovers that Charlie has died, so flees and meets Kyle, asking him to run away with her. Martin calls her, claiming that Kyle is not who he says he is and Stacey accuses Kyle of being the devil. She takes a cab and sees a vision of Charlie driving it, and he convinces her to return home to Walford. During a storm she goes to the roof of The Queen Victoria public house, saying that God is coming for Arthur. Martin finds her there and she tells him that Arthur was sent from God and now she is waiting for God to rescue them. Martin is forced to go along with this and convinces her to come home with him.|$|E

2500|$|As the {{new school}} year starts in September, Roy Straitley {{is looking forward to}} his 100th term at St Oswald's, where he <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>teaching</b> for 33 years. Having never married, he lives alone and has devoted his life to his career. His sitting room walls are full of {{pictures}} of [...] "his boys", and St Oswald's represents his only family. He is slightly overweight and ugly by conventional standards (his nickname among his pupils is [...] "Quaz", short for [...] "Quasimodo"). Popular with the students, he adheres to the old principle of being [...] "firm but fair" [...] where teaching and disciplinary matters are concerned. An incurable optimist, Straitley is only uncomfortable when he has to deal with the opposite sex. He is a keen observer, and hardly anything connected with life at the school, however insignificant, ever escapes his notice. A firm believer in the advantages and importance of a classical education, he shuns computers, resorts to Latin to swear and insult his colleagues (which they do not understand), and opposes the idea of any competition between schools other than the kind which is carried out on the playing fields. Smoking Gauloises in his empty form room is his [...] "one concession to the influence of the Modern Languages", and there is long-standing enmity between Straitley and Dr Devine, the Head of German.|$|E
2500|$|Harlan later {{finds that}} the kettles will not travel to the time he hid Noÿs (there is a block at the 100,000th century), and confronts Assistant Computer Finge with a weapon, accusing him of sabotaging matters out of jealousy. Finge states he has {{reported}} Harlan's conduct, and did not place the block. Harlan is summoned to the Council but is not reprimanded; he deduces that because his transgressions were ignored, he must be there to serve a larger purpose. Harlan confronts Twissell and explains that he <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>teaching</b> himself temporal mathematics and believes that its 23rd century inventor, Vikkor Mallansohn, must have been helped in his discovery by someone from his future; he concludes that his current role is training Cooper to do this. Twissell confirms this, adding that unknown to Cooper, Mallansohn's secret memoirs show that Cooper will take over Mallansohn's role and in effect, become Mallansohn. This must be kept from Cooper, so that Eternity will be founded as it historically was. Harlan blackmails Twissell by threatening to destroy Cooper's ignorance unless Noÿs is returned, but is outwitted; Twissell locks him {{in the control room}} with all controls deactivated other than the lever to send Cooper back - matching the memoir's statement that this was his role. Harlan, enraged, breaks open the controls and changes the power output, causing Cooper to be sent back to an unknown point estimated to be in the early 20th century.|$|E
