5|$|A new {{civil war}} broke out when Duke Béla claimed the crown for himself in 1059, but his three sons {{accepted}} the rule of Solomon, Andrew I's son, in 1063. Initially, the young king and <b>his</b> <b>cousins</b> cooperated; for instance, they jointly defeated the Pechenegs plundering Transylvania in 1068. The power conflict in the royal family caused a new civil war in 1071. It lasted up to Solomon's abdication in favor of one of <b>his</b> <b>cousins,</b> Ladislaus, in the early 1080s.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{often took}} Lennon and <b>his</b> <b>cousins</b> {{to the cinema}} or the park, even though he worked at night and {{early in the morning}} on the farm and his milk round. When the cousins played outside Smith allowed them to eat meals with their hands in the garden shed. During the school {{holidays}} Lennon and <b>his</b> <b>cousins</b> were allowed to accompany Smith on his milk rounds, and every year he allowed Lennon to place a bet on the Grand National.|$|E

5|$|During summer {{holidays}} {{with his family}} in Dublin he met {{and fell in love with}} Cherrie Matheson, a friend of one of <b>his</b> <b>cousins</b> and a member of the Plymouth Brethren. He proposed to her in 1895 and again the next year, but she turned him down on both occasions because of their differing views on religion. This rejection affected Synge greatly and reinforced his determination to spend as much time as possible outside Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Humphrey Stafford {{had been}} Earl of Devon for exactly three {{months at the}} time of his death. He and Isabel had no children, so when he died his title became extinct. It was {{restored}} the next year for John Courtenay, the brother of Thomas, the last Courtenay earl of Devon. Stafford was buried in Glastonbury Abbey, and a dispute over his lands followed between <b>his</b> <b>cousins.</b>|$|E
60|$|Phonny {{was rather}} {{surprised}} to hear <b>his</b> <b>cousin</b> Wallace speak thus. He had {{thought that he was}} manly--very manly; but it was evident that <b>his</b> <b>cousin</b> considered him boyish.|$|R
50|$|Madog {{was close}} to <b>his</b> <b>cousin,</b> Llywelyn ap Iorwerth, initially, but {{gradually}} distanced himself and also kept aloof from 1212 when <b>his</b> <b>cousin</b> had managed to reform the Welsh Confederacy and looked instead to King John of England, in whose pay he was, as an official ally of the English king. By 1215 he decided to ally with <b>his</b> <b>cousin</b> and remained so.|$|R
50|$|Waite was a {{spokesperson}} while <b>his</b> <b>cousin,</b> Terry Waite, was {{held hostage in}} Beirut in the 1990s. He remembers presenting a special programme for <b>his</b> <b>cousin,</b> which Terry managed to hear.|$|R
5|$|In the {{following}} years, Solomon and <b>his</b> <b>cousins</b> jointly {{fought against the}} Czechs, the Cumans and other enemies of the kingdom. Their relationship deteriorated in the early 1070s and Géza rebelled against him. Solomon could only maintain his rule in a small zone along the western frontiers of Hungary after his defeat in the Battle of Mogyoród on 14 March 1074. He officially abdicated in 1081, but was arrested for conspiring against Géza's brother and successor, Ladislaus.|$|E
5|$|While in {{his early}} teens, Tolkien had his first {{encounter}} with a constructed language, Animalic, an invention of <b>his</b> <b>cousins,</b> Mary and Marjorie Incledon. At that time, he was studying Latin and Anglo-Saxon. Their interest in Animalic soon died away, but Mary and others, including Tolkien himself, invented {{a new and more}} complex language called Nevbosh. The next constructed language he came to work with, Naffarin, would be his own creation.|$|E
5|$|According to Antonucci, he based the {{characters}} on real {{people in his}} life. The personalities of Ed, Double D, and Eddy are based on his own traits {{as well as the}} activities of his two sons, while the cul-de-sac children and the Kanker sisters were all based on children he grew up with. Rolf is based on Antonucci and <b>his</b> <b>cousins,</b> since he was part of an Italian immigrant family, and grew up in a first generation foreign household with different customs and ways of living, compared to those born in Canada.|$|E

5|$|Bamber {{launched}} two legal actions {{while in}} prison {{to secure a}} share of the estate, which the cousins said was part of an attempt to harass and vilify them. In 2003 he began a High Court action to recover £1.2m from the estate of his adoptive grandmother, arguing that he should have inherited her home at Carbonnells Farm, Wix, Essex, which went instead to June's sister—the grandmother had cut Bamber out of her will when he was arrested—and that he was owed 17 years' rent from <b>his</b> <b>cousins</b> who lived there. In 2004 he went to the High Court again to claim a £326,000 share of the profit from the caravan site. The court ruled against him.|$|E
5|$|Formal {{schooling}} did {{not start}} in Hungary {{until the age of}} ten. Instead, governesses taught von Neumann, his brothers and <b>his</b> <b>cousins.</b> Max believed that knowledge of languages other than Hungarian was essential, so the children were tutored in English, French, German and Italian. By the age of 8, von Neumann was familiar with differential and integral calculus, but he was particularly interested in history, reading his way through Wilhelm Oncken's 46-volume Allgemeine Geschichte in Einzeldarstellungen. A copy was contained in a private library Max purchased. One of the rooms in the apartment was converted into a library and reading room, with bookshelves from ceiling to floor.|$|E
5|$|In late August 1917, {{the rotary}} engine F.I {{prototype}} {{was assigned to}} Voss as his personal aircraft. In his childhood, Voss had flown Japanese fighting kites with <b>his</b> <b>cousins</b> in Krefeld; the decorations on the kites gave him the inspiration to paint the nose cowling of his triplane with two eyes, eyebrows and a moustache. The arrival of the new fighter brought celebrities visiting. On 31 August, Anthony Fokker escorted German Chancellor Georg Michaelis and Major General Ernst von Lossberg to see and film the new triplane. On 9 September, Crown Prince Wilhelm would also visit Jasta 10.|$|E

5|$|Later that month, Emmerich's Chasseurs, {{an elite}} unit of Loyalist militia and Hessian mercenaries, staged a midnight raid on Storm's Bridge. Hoping to capture Storm and <b>his</b> <b>cousins</b> the Van Tassels, all {{active in the}} local Patriot militia, the Chasseurs settled for burning and looting Storm's house and tavern. Proceeding on to the Van Tassel houses, they trapped Cornelius Van Tassel Jr., one of the cousins' teenage sons. As the Chasseurs {{set fire to the}} houses, he hid on a roof, then jumped off, fended off some {{putative}} captors, and fled into the cold waters of the nearby Saw Mill. He got away, but soon died of hypothermia.|$|E

Another of <b>his</b> <b>cousins</b> is Shareese Ulis, point guard for Cincinnati Lady Bearcats, who had been a two-time Toledo Blade Player of the Year. During his time in middle school, Ulis became friends with future Phoenix Suns teammate Devin Booker.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the epic}} poem Mahabharata, Krishna becomes Arjuna's charioteer for the Kurukshetra War, {{but on the}} {{condition}} that he personally will not raise any weapon. Upon arrival at the battlefield, and seeing that the enemies are his family, his grandfather, and <b>his</b> <b>cousins</b> and loved ones, Arjuna is moved and says his heart will not allow him to fight and kill others. He would rather renounce the kingdom and put down his Gandiv (Arjuna's bow). Krishna then advises him about the nature of life, ethics, and morality when one is faced with a war between good and evil, the impermanence of matter, the permanence of the soul and the good, duties and responsibilities, the nature of true peace and bliss and the different types of yoga to reach this state of bliss and inner liberation. This conversation between Krishna and Arjuna is presented as a discourse called the Bhagavad Gita.|$|E

5|$|After the Boston Massacre, Adams {{and other}} town leaders met with Bernard's {{successor}} Governor Thomas Hutchinson and with Colonel William Dalrymple, the army commander, {{to demand the}} withdrawal of the troops. The situation remained explosive, and so Dalrymple agreed to remove both regiments to Castle William. Adams wanted the soldiers to have a fair trial, because this would show that Boston was not controlled by a lawless mob, but was instead the victim of an unjust occupation. He convinced <b>his</b> <b>cousins</b> John Adams and Josiah Quincy to defend the soldiers, knowing that those Whigs would not slander Boston to gain an acquittal. However, Adams wrote essays condemning the outcome of the trials; he thought that the soldiers should have been convicted of murder.|$|E
5|$|As Buoso Donati lies {{dead in his}} curtained four-poster bed, his {{relatives}} gather round to mourn his passing, but are really more interested in learning {{the contents of his}} will. Among those present are <b>his</b> <b>cousins</b> Zita and Simone, his poor-relation brother-in-law Betto, and Zita's nephew Rinuccio. Betto mentions a rumour he has heard that Buoso has left everything to a monastery; this disturbs the others and precipitates a frantic search for the will. The document is found by Rinuccio, who is confident that his uncle has left him plenty of money. He withholds the will momentarily and asks Zita to allow him to marry Lauretta, daughter of Gianni Schicchi, a newcomer to Florence. Zita replies that if Buoso has left them rich, he can marry whom he pleases; she and the other relatives are anxious to begin reading the will. A happy Rinuccio sends little Gherardino to fetch Schicchi and Lauretta.|$|E
5|$|Before the Beatles {{achieved}} nationwide {{success in}} Britain, Epstein had permitted a company (run by <b>his</b> <b>cousins</b> and initially catering to fan club members), to produce Beatles' sweaters for 30 shillings (£1.50) and badges for 6 pence (6d) (2½p). It sold 15,000 sweaters and 50,000 badges as the group's popularity grew. When Beatlemania swept the UK in November 1963, Epstein was besieged by novelty goods companies desperate {{to use the}} Beatles' name on plastic guitars, drums, disc racks, badges, belts and other merchandise. Epstein refused to allow the Beatles to endorse any product directly, but through NEMS Enterprises he granted discretionary licences to companies {{who were able to}} produce quality products at a fair price, even though many companies were already selling products without a licence.|$|E
50|$|In 1436, he and <b>his</b> <b>cousin</b> Henry and <b>his</b> remote <b>cousin</b> Henry IV of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, jointly {{inherited}} the Lordship of Werle.|$|R
