40|$|Extract] The law of {{negligence}} requires any party one {{is considered by}} law to owe another party a duty of care, to take reasonable steps to prevent the other party from getting injured. If there is a breach of that duty and the other party suffers harm, then the <b>first</b> <b>party</b> may <b>liable</b> in a negligence claim. Within sport, it is {{the implementation of a}} suitable risk management scheme that will usually take care of the duty of care requirements. This paper will therefore examine the application of the law {{of negligence}} to the sporting context, and what is involved with a risk management scheme...|$|R
5000|$|No notice need {{be given}} to any <b>party</b> <b>liable</b> on the {{instrument}} for transfer of the rights under the instrument by negotiation. However, payment by the <b>party</b> <b>liable</b> to the person previously entitled to enforce the instrument [...] "counts" [...] as payment on the note until adequate notice has been received by the <b>liable</b> <b>party</b> that a different party is to receive payments from then on. §3-602(b) ...|$|R

50|$|Lord Hope agreed. He noted Blackburn J said in Cory v Thames Ironworks Co {{saying if}} the damage were {{exceptional}} and unnatural {{it would be}} harsh to make a <b>party</b> <b>liable</b> for it, because had he known he would have pushed for {{more time in the}} first place.|$|R
5000|$|HCR 70(4) {{provides}} that the taxing master shall not {{proceed to the}} taxation of any bill of costs unless he is satisfied that the <b>party</b> <b>liable</b> to pay has received due notice as to {{the time and place}} of such taxation, together with notice that he is entitled to be present. Such notice is not necessary, however, ...|$|R
40|$|Glenwood Homes Pty Ltd v Everhard [2008] QSC 192 {{involved}} the not uncommon situation where one costs order is made against several parties {{represented by a}} single firm of solicitors.

50|$|Some {{employers}} {{offer to}} provide their employees fringe benefits in place of part of their salary in an arrangement called salary packaging. Such arrangements, if available, {{can be an effective}} way of reducing the employee's income tax by reducing salary. Though the employer is the <b>party</b> <b>liable</b> to pay FBT, many employers will recover the FBT liability from the employee, usually as part of the packaging arrangement.|$|R

25|$|Article 10 of the Law of Cohesion {{establishes}} {{that the}} financing of the Spanish health system {{is the responsibility of}} the autonomous communities in conformity with the accords of transfer and the current system of autonomic financing, notwithstanding the existence of a third <b>party</b> <b>liable</b> to pay. Sufficient financing of services is determined by the resources assigned to the autonomous communities in conformity to what is established in the laws of autonomic financing.|$|R
5000|$|Contributory {{liability}} {{is rooted}} in the tort theory of enterprise liability. Contributory liability holds the third <b>party</b> <b>liable</b> for the primary act based on the third party's relationship with the actual harm - either by enabling or by benefiting from it. As the court stated in Gershwin Publ’g Corp. v. Columbia Artists Mgmt.: “one who, with knowledge of the infringing activity, induces, causes, or materially contributes … may be held liable as a contributory infringer.” ...|$|R
50|$|Subrogation is {{the right}} of the insurer, having indemnified the insured in terms of the policy, to receive the benefit of all the rights of the insured against third parties. The insurer may take charge of {{litigation}} against third <b>parties</b> <b>liable</b> for loss to the insured. The proceedings are {{in the name of the}} insured, with the insurer as dominus litis. Subrogation, then, is essentially a right of recourse without transfer of rights.|$|R
50|$|In some jurisdictions, {{the courts}} will seldom apply {{principles}} of fault, but might willingly hold a <b>party</b> <b>liable</b> for {{a breach of}} a fiduciary duty {{to his or her}} spouse (for example, see Family Code Sections 720 and 1100 of the California Family Code). Grounds for divorce differs from state to state in the U.S. Some states have no-fault divorce; some states require a declaration of fault on the part of one partner or both; some states allow either method.|$|R
5000|$|The {{doctrine}} of equivalents {{is a legal}} rule in many (but not all) of the world's patent systems that allows a court to hold a <b>party</b> <b>liable</b> for patent infringement even though the infringing device or process does not fall within the literal scope of a patent claim, but nevertheless {{is equivalent to the}} claimed invention. U.S. Judge Learned Hand has described its purpose as being [...] "to temper unsparing logic and prevent an infringer from stealing the benefit of the invention".|$|R

We propose a formal framework for specifying and reasoning about decentralized logs to be used in legal disputes. In addition, we study how previous results can be used in the incremental analysis of larger inputs to obtain precise or approximated results. We illustrate our approach with an example of a travel arrangement service...|$|R
50|$|Impleader is a {{procedural}} device before trial {{in which one}} party joins a third party into a lawsuit because that third <b>party</b> is <b>liable</b> to an original defendant. Using the vocabulary of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the defendant seeks to become a third-party plaintiff by filing a third party complaint against a third party not presently party to the lawsuit, who thereby becomes a third-party defendant. This complaint alleges that the third <b>party</b> is <b>liable</b> for {{all or part of}} the damages that the original plaintiff may win from the original defendant.|$|R
5000|$|The {{foundation}} was {{preceded by}} talks between former KPD functionaries and Gustav Heinemann, the West German minister of justice, who explained to them that while a refounding of a banned party was not legally possible, Communists were free to form an entirely new party. Even though the close links to the banned KPD made the new <b>party</b> <b>liable</b> to be declared illegal, no such declaration was requested by the German government as West German authorities were liberalizing the attitude towards the communist bloc and East Germany in particular.|$|R

40|$|This Note {{argues that}} CERCLA, {{as it is}} {{currently}} written, requires courts to hold <b>parties</b> <b>liable</b> for pre-purchase soil investigations that spread or mix contamination because to conclude otherwise would stretch CERCLA beyond its breaking point. Part I argues that both those who order pre-acquisition soil testing and those who conduct the tests are PRPs if the testing spreads existing contamination. Part II argues that the statute {{does not allow for}} the judicial creation of a soil testing liability exception. Part III acknowledges the policy problems created by testing liability and advocates a legislative solution to exempt pre-purchase soil testing from CERCLA liability...|$|R
50|$|In August 2013, Lawrence Lessig brought {{suit against}} Liberation Music PTY Ltd., after Liberation issued a {{takedown}} notice {{of one of}} Lessig's lectures on YouTube which had used the song by Phoenix, whom Liberation Music represents. Lessig sought damages under section 512(f) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which holds <b>parties</b> <b>liable</b> for misrepresentations of infringement or removal of material. Lessig was represented by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Jones Day. In February 2014 the case ended with a settlement in which Liberation Music admitted wrongdoing in issuing the takedown notice, issued an apology, and paid a confidential sum in compensation.|$|R

50|$|An offset in law, is a {{reduction}} in the amount of a judgment granted to a losing party based on debts owed by the prevailing party to the losing party. For example, if an employee successfully sued an employer for wrongful termination, the employer might be entitled to an offset if the employer could demonstrate that it had previously made an overpayment to that employee which had not been returned. A party may similarly be entitled to an offset where it can demonstrate that the prevailing party has already received compensation for its injuries through insurance, a judgment against another <b>party</b> <b>liable</b> for those injuries, or some other source.|$|R

40|$|An {{authentication}} system and method is presented for authenticating a <b>first</b> <b>party</b> {{to a second}} party, where an operation is performed on condition that the authentication succeeds. The authentication method verifies whether the <b>first</b> <b>party</b> is authenticated. If the <b>first</b> <b>party</b> is not authenticated, then it is determined if the <b>first</b> <b>party</b> qualifies for a sub-authorization. The sub-authorization depends on a value of a grace-counter associated {{with a number of}} times that <b>first</b> <b>parties</b> have been qualified for the sub-authorization. If the <b>first</b> <b>party</b> qualifies for the sub-authorization, the operation is performed and the grace counter is decremented.

5000|$|One {{person who}} has been an active member of a group with a common purpose may escape {{liability}} by withdrawing before the other(s) go on to commit the crime.

In R v Becerra (1975) 62 Crim. App. R. 212 it was held that any communication of withdrawal by the secondary party to the perpetrator must be such as to serve [...] "unequivocal notice" [...] upon the other party to the common purpose that, if he proceeds upon it, he does so without the further aid and assistance of the withdrawing party.: ...|$|R
40|$|The {{environmental}} damage harms or threatens {{the two groups}} of interests - public and private. Both types of interests are often damaged by one event. The tort law and public liability including their financial security are therefore functionally interconnected systems, which sometimes overlap. They do not contradict but usefully complement each other. At the international level, there are several treaties governing the liability for transboundary pollution. Only one convention is legally binding and used in practice - CLC liability for oil transportation by sea, conventions on liability for nuclear damage are binding but were never used in practice. All these conventions use the classical scheme of tort law. They apply only to accidents. The liability is always objective with defences (natural phenomenon, force majeure, conduct of a third <b>party).</b> The <b>liable</b> <b>party</b> is always channelled to easily identifiable subject. In the case of multiple <b>liable</b> <b>parties,</b> they are <b>liable</b> jointly and severally. Damage must be quantifiable in money and the amount must be proved by the victim. In the case of harm to the environment, the damage is derived from the costs for reasonable preventive and corrective measures. The compensation for losses is necessary to apply in a certain period of time. These periods are [...] ...|$|R
