5|$|Although <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> {{is practiced}} freely within Hong Kong, <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> {{practitioners}} from abroad have also reported being blacklisted {{from entering the}} territory. In 2001, Hong Kong officials admitted that they had used a blacklist to deny entry to approximately 100 <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> practitioners during a visit by then-Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin. In 2004, a Canadian <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> practitioner on a book tour was denied entry to the territory, and in 2008, two <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> practitioners from the United States and Switzerland were separately denied entry while on professional and research trips.|$|E
5|$|When <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> {{was banned}} in {{mainland}} China in 1999, re-education through labor became a common punishment for practitioners. Some {{human rights groups}} claim {{that as many as}} 10,000 <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> members were detained in between 1999 and 2002, with as many as 5,000 detained in 2001 alone. More recent estimates suggest that hundreds of thousands of <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> adherents are imprisoned in China, with some sources estimating up to half of the official reeducation through labor camp population is <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> practitioners. In some labor camps, <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> practitioners make up the majority population.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the spiritual}} {{practice}} of <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> has little clear organization, practitioners of <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> have organized considerably among themselves since 1999, establishing their own research and advocacy organizations, media groups, and arts companies.|$|E
50|$|Some {{aspects of}} <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong's</b> teachings are {{considered}} implausible and peculiar by observers, and <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong's</b> conservative and moralistic views on {{subjects such as}} sexuality have attracted controversy.|$|R

5|$|Chinese {{human rights}} lawyers have {{charged that the}} 610 Office {{regularly}} interferes with legal cases involving <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> practitioners, subverting the ability of judges to adjudicate independently. Attorney Jiang Tianyong has noted that cases where the defendants are <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> practitioners are decided by the local 610 Offices, rather than through recourse to legal standards. In November 2008, two lawyers seeking to represent <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> practitioners in Heilongjiang noted that the presiding judge in the case was seen meeting with 610 Office agents. Other lawyers, including Gao Zhisheng, Guo Guoting and Wang Yajun have alleged that the 610 Office interfered with their ability to meet with <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> clients or defend them in court.|$|E
5|$|Since 1999, <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> {{practitioners}} outside China {{have reported}} having their telephone lines tapped and electronic correspondence monitored. <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> websites based outside China were the earliest targets of Chinese {{denial of service}} attacks, according to Chinese internet expert Ethan Gutmann. In 2011, dated stock footage aired on China Central Television of People's Liberation Army staff carrying out attacks on U.S.-based <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> websites.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> {{practitioners}} and organizations outside China {{are engaged in}} the promotion of classical visual and performing arts. Practitioners frame <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> as {{being part of the}} wider cultural tradition that gave rise to Chinese arts, which they describe as having been persecuted and attacked under Communist Party rule.|$|E

50|$|According to Stephen O'Leary of the University of Southern California, the <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong's</b> Internet {{awareness}} was {{an important}} factor in its ability to organize unauthorized demonstrations in the People's Republic of China. The group's leader, Li Hongzhi, was able to use the Internet to coordinate the movement, although he currently lives in New York.|$|R
5|$|Anniversaries of {{significant}} dates in the persecution are marked with protests by <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> {{communities around the}} world. In Washington DC, for instance, the anniversary of 20 July 1999 {{is marked by a}} rally at the U.S. capitol attended by several thousand practitioners. Diplomatic visits by high-ranking Chinese officials are also met with demonstrations by <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> practitioners.|$|E
5|$|Chinese {{authorities}} reportedly maintain {{lists of}} high-profile overseas <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> practitioners, {{and they use}} these blacklists to impose travel and visa restrictions on practitioners. Chen Yonglin, the defector from the Chinese consulate in Sydney, said in 2005 that approximately 800 Australian <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> practitioners had been blacklisted (Chen claimed he sought to remove most of these names).|$|E
5|$|Ethan Gutmann, citing <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> {{allegations}} that Liaoning was {{the epicenter of}} organ harvesting from practitioners while Bo was governor, suggested {{that he may have}} used his involvement as a way of building up his political power. David Kilgour, who co-wrote the Kilgour–Matas report on organ harvesting, accused Bo of playing a role. Separately, <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> practitioners abroad filed over ten lawsuits against Bo alleging torture and crimes against humanity In 2009, a Spanish court indicted Bo Xilai and four other officials for genocide against <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Falun</b> <b>Gong's</b> ordeal has {{attracted}} {{a large amount of}} international attention from governments and non-government organizations. Human rights organizations, such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have raised acute concerns over reports of torture and ill-treatment of practitioners in China and have also urged the UN and international governments to intervene {{to bring an end to}} the persecution.|$|R
50|$|<b>Falun</b> <b>Gong's</b> {{departure}} from the state-run CQRS corresponded to a wider shift in the government's attitudes towards qigong practices. As qigong's detractors in government grew more influential, authorities began attempting {{to rein in the}} growth and influence of these groups, some of which had amassed tens of millions of followers. In the mid-1990s the state-run media began publishing articles critical of qigong.|$|R
50|$|Tensions {{continued}} to mount between Li and the CQRS in 1996. In {{the face of}} <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong's</b> rise in popularity—a large part of which was attributed to its low cost—competing qigong masters accused Li of undercutting them. According to Schechter, the qigong society under which Li and other qigong masters belonged asked Li to hike his tuition, but Li emphasized {{the need for the}} teachings to be free of charge.|$|R
5|$|From 1999–2001, Western {{media reports}} on Falun Gong—and in particular, the mistreatment of practitioners—were frequent, if mixed. By {{the latter half}} of 2001, however, the volume of media reports {{declined}} precipitously, and by 2002, coverage of <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> by major news organizations like the New York Times and Washington Post had almost completely ceased, particularly from within China. In a study of media discourse on <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong,</b> researcher Leeshai Lemish found that Western news organizations also became less balanced, and more likely to uncritically present the narratives of the Communist Party, rather than those of <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> or human rights groups.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, North American <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> {{computer}} scientists began developing circumvention and annonymizing tools to enable those in mainland China to access information on <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong.</b> Their software tools, such as Freegate and GPass, have since {{become a popular}} means of evading government controls of the internet in several other countries.|$|E
5|$|In July 1999, the Communist Party {{initiated}} {{a campaign to}} persecute <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong,</b> including {{through the use of}} extralegal imprisonment, torture and other coercive measures, and propaganda. <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> communities inside and outside China have adopted a variety of approaches to resist and mitigate the persecution in China. These tactics range from engagement with the media, lobbying of governments and NGOs, public protests and demonstrations, and attempts to seek legal redress. As the persecution in China progressed, overseas <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> efforts increasingly tied their pleas for relief to Western human rights discourse, emphasizing the implications for freedom of speech, assembly, and conscience.|$|E
500|$|<b>Falun</b> <b>Gong's</b> {{reliance}} on {{the internet as a}} means of organizing has led to the group's characterization by some observers as [...] "a virtual religious community," [...] though other scholars are wary about overstating the significance of the internet. Scott Lowe, for instance, believes that the Internet is not a significant factor in attracting people to the practice; instead, the influence of family and friends, as well as the prospect of better health, seem far more important in establishing initial interest.|$|R
5|$|In 2003, 80 Taiwanese {{practitioners}} {{were blocked}} from entering Hong Kong, {{and again in}} 2007, hundreds more Taiwanese were blocked from entering Hong Kong or detained at the airport, These events set off a six-year human rights case that tested {{the integrity of the}} one country, two systems arrangement. In 2009, <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong's</b> case against the Hong Kong immigration department was dismissed. Months later, Hong Kong immigration officials denied visas to several members of the Falun Gong-affiliated Shen Yun dance company, which was scheduled to perform in the territory in January 2010. Democratic Party chairman Albert Ho said the denial of the visas was a worrying new erosion of Hong Kong's freedoms, and damaged the reputation of Hong Kong as a liberal and open society. A court ruling in March 2010 overturned the Immigration Department's decision.|$|R
5|$|In June 2002, when Jiang Zemin visited Iceland, Icelandic {{authorities}} {{complied with}} requests from the Chinese government to deny entry to <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> practitioners {{who sought to}} enter the country to protest. Using a blacklist provided by China, hundreds of <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> practitioners were turned away by the national airline or detained if they managed {{to make it to}} the country. The blacklisting ignited protests by Icelandic citizens and members of parliament. In 2011, Iceland's foreign minister Össur Skarphéðinsson issued an apology for violating <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> practitioners' freedom of expression and movement.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to high-profile lawsuits against Chinese officials and corporations, <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> practitioners {{have filed a}} number of complaints and civil suits alleging discrimination outside China, most of them centered within the Chinese diaspora community. Several complaints have been made after <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> groups were barred from participating in parades or events, with mixed results. In Canada and in New York, <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> practitioners won judgments against Chinese businesses or community organizations for discriminating against them {{on the basis of}} their religious creed.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to prisons, labor camps and transformation facilities, the 610 Office can arbitrarily compel mentally healthy <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> practitioners into psychiatric facilities. In 2002, {{it was estimated}} that approximately 1,000 <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> adherents were being held against their will in mental hospitals, where reports of abuse were common.|$|E
5|$|On 13 May 2009, lawyers Zhang Kai and Li Chunfu are violently {{beaten and}} {{detained}} in Chongqing for investigating {{the death of}} Jiang Xiqing, a 66-year-old <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> practitioner killed in a labor camp. One month earlier, Beijing lawyer Cheng Hai was similarly beaten by police in Sichuan province for seeking to defend a <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> adherent.|$|E
5|$|Practitioners of <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> have {{launched}} {{a number of}} other campaigns to bring attention to the treatment of <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> in China. Notable examples include the Human Rights Torch Relay, which toured to over 35 countries in 2007 and 2008 ahead of the 2008 Beijing Olympics. The relay was intended to draw attention to a range of human rights issues in China in connection with the Olympics, especially those related to <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> and Tibet, and received support from hundreds of elected officials, past Olympic medallists, human rights groups and other concerned organizations.|$|E
5|$|Soon thereafter, in May 2006, The Coalition to Investigate the Persecution of <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> asked David Kilgour {{as well as}} Canadian {{human rights}} lawyer David Matas to {{investigate}} the broader allegations of organ harvesting from <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> adherents in China. Kilgour and Matas agreed to investigate.|$|E
5|$|The Tiananmen Square {{self-immolation}} incident {{took place}} in Tiananmen Square in central Beijing, {{on the eve of}} Chinese New Year on 23 January 2001. The incident is disputed; Chinese government sources say that five members of <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong,</b> a spiritual practice that is persecuted in mainland China, set themselves on fire in the square. <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> sources disputed the accuracy of these portrayals, noting that their teachings explicitly forbid violence or suicide. Several Western journalists and scholars also noted inconsistencies in the government's account of event, suggesting the self-immolations were staged by the government to discredit <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong.</b>|$|E
5|$|Translations of <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> teachings began {{appearing}} in the late 1990s. Although the practice was beginning to attract an overseas constituency, it remained relatively unknown in the Western world until the Spring of 1999, when tensions between <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> and Communist Party authorities became a subject of international media coverage. With the increased attention, the practice gained a greater following outside China. Following {{the launch of the}} Communist Party's persecution of <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong,</b> the overseas presence became vital to the practice's resistance in China and its continued survival.|$|E
5|$|<b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> sources {{overseas}} {{questioned the}} official Chinese government {{account of the}} event, and apparent inconsistencies in government's official narrative led to a hypothesis that the self-immolation was staged {{by the government to}} justify the persecution against <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> by portraying its practitioners as irrational and suicidal. According to this hypothesis, the self-immolation participants were paid actors, and were presumably assured that the flames would be extinguished before doing real harm.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, under {{pressure}} from Chinese authorities, the Vietnamese government tried two <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> practitioners who had been operating a shortwave radio station and broadcasting information into China. The pair was charged with unlicensed broadcasting, and sentenced to 2 and 3 years in prison. Earlier in the same year, another radio station operated by <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> practitioners in Indonesia, Radio Erabaru, was shuttered under diplomatic pressure from China.|$|E
5|$|On 22 April 2010, Beijing lawyers Liu Wei and Tang Jitian were {{permanently}} disbarred for defending <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> practitioners.|$|E
5|$|On April 25, 1999, over 10,000 <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> adherents {{demonstrated}} quietly {{near the}} Zhongnanhai government compound to request official recognition {{and an end}} to the escalating harassment against them. Security czar and politburo member Luo Gan was the first {{to draw attention to the}} gathering crowd. Luo reportedly called Communist Party general secretary Jiang Zemin, and demanded a decisive solution to the <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> problem.|$|E
5|$|Several {{sources have}} {{reported}} 610 officers as {{being involved in}} or ordering the torture of <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> adherents in custody. In a letter to Chinese leaders in 2005, prominent human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng relayed accounts of 610 officers beating and sexually assaulting <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> practitioners: “of all the true accounts of incredible violence that I have heard, of all {{the records of the}} government’s inhuman torture of its own people, what has shaken me most is the routine practice {{on the part of the}} 6–10 Office and the police of assaulting women’s genitals,” wrote Gao. Defector Hao Fengjun described witnessing one of his 610 Office colleagues beating an elderly female <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> practitioner with an iron bar. The event helped catalyze Hao's decision to defect to Australia. The 2009 report of the UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial Killings relayed allegations that the 610 Office was involved in the torture deaths of <b>Falun</b> <b>Gong</b> practitioners ahead of the 2008 Beijing Olympics.|$|E
