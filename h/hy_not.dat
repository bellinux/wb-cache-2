40|$|We have {{characterized}} a far-red-light {{response that}} induces a novel pathway for plastid development in Arabidopsis seedlings. This response {{results in the}} inability of cotyledons to green upon subsequent white light illumination, and the response is suppressed by exogenous sucrose.

Ultrastructural analysis showed that the far-red block correlates with both the failure of plastids to accumulate prolamellar bodies {{and the formation of}} vesicles in the stroma. We present evidence that the far-red block of greening is the result of severe repression of protochlorophyllide reductase (POR) genes by far-red light coupled with irreversible plastid damage.

40|$|Dynamic {{cerebral}} autoregulation (CA) {{is challenged}} by exercise and may become less effective when exercise is exhaustive. Exercise may increase arterial glucose concentration, and we evaluated whether the cerebrovascular response to exercise {{is affected by}} hyperglycemia. The effects of a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp (EU) and hyperglycemic clamp (HY) on the cerebrovascular (CVRI) and systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) responses were evaluated in seven healthy subjects at rest and during rhythmic handgrip exercise. Transfer function analysis of the dynamic relationship between beat-to-beat changes in mean arterial pressure and middle cerebral artery (MCA) mean blood flow velocity (V-mean) {{was used to assess}} dynamic CA. At rest, SVRI decreased with HY and EU (P < 0. 01). CVRI was maintained with EU but became reduced with HY [11 % (SD 3); P < 0. 01], and MCA Vmean increased (P < 0. 05), whereas brain catecholamine uptake and arterial Pco(2) did <b>not</b> change significantly. <b>HY</b> did <b>not</b> affect the normalized low-frequency gain between mean arterial pressure and MCA Vmean or the phase shift, indicating maintained dynamic CA. With HY, the increase in CVRI associated with exercise was enhanced (19 +/- 7 % vs. 9 +/- 7 %; P < 0. 05), concomitant with a larger increase in heart rate and cardiac output and a larger reduction in SVRI (22 +/- 4 % vs. 14 +/- 2 %; P < 0. 05). Thus hyperglycemia lowered cerebral vascular tone independently of CA capacity at rest, whereas dynamic CA remained able to modulate cerebral blood flow around the exercise-induced increase in MCA Vmean.

40|$|Arabidopsis HY 5 is a bZIP {{transcription}} factor that promotes photomorphogenesis. Previous studies suggested that COP 1, a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis, directly interacts with nuclear HY 5 and targets it for proteasome-mediated degradation. Light negatively regulates the nuclear level of COP 1 and thus permits HY 5 accumulation. Here {{we report that}} HY 5 abundance peaks in early seedling development, consistent with its role in promoting photomorphogenesis. HY 5 acts exclusively within a complex and exists in two isoforms, resulting from phosphorylation within its COP 1 binding domain by a light- regulated kinase activity. Unphosphorylated HY 5 shows stronger interaction with COP 1, is the preferred substrate for degradation, has higher affinity to target promoters and is physiologically more active than the phosphorylated version. Therefore, HY 5 phosphorylation provides an added level of light-mediated regulation of HY 5 stability and activity besides nuclear COP 1 levels. Regulated <b>HY</b> 5 phosphorylation <b>not</b> only provides abundant and physiologically more active unphosphorylated HY 5 in the light, but also helps to maintain a small pool of less active phosphorylated HY 5 in the dark, which could be essential for a rapid initial response during dark-to-light transition...|$|R

Previous work {{has shown that}} FHY 1 /FHL distribute phyA signals directly to HFR 1 and LAF 1, both of which regulate largely independent pathways, but the relationship of HY 5 to these two factors was unclear. Here, we investigated the genetic relationship among the genes encoding these three transcription factors, HY 5, HFR 1 and LAF 1. Analyses of double and triple mutants showed that HY 5, a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) factor, HFR 1, a basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) factor, and LAF 1, a Myb factor, independently transmit phyA signals downstream. We showed that <b>HY</b> 5 but <b>not</b> its homolog, HYH, could interact with HFR 1 and LAF 1; on the other hand, FHY 1 and its homo-log, FHL did <b>not</b> interact with <b>HY</b> 5 or HYH.

40|$|To {{validate}} (further) {{a semantic}} model called RICHPIG, {{which was designed}} to assess enrichment materials for pigs, a study was conducted to examine the importance of three assessment criteria, namely destructibility, hygiene and sound. These material properties were studied using a specially constructed object consisting of a piece of sisal rope, metal wire and three fixed chain links hanging in the pens. The object was considered to be not destructible (ND), hygienic (<b>HY)</b> and <b>not</b> making sound (NS). After a habituation period of 18 h treatments were applied in that the object was (or was not) made destructible with a partial cut in the rope (DE) and/or was soiled with excreta (not hygienic, NH) and/or was allowed to make a tinkling sound by releasing the chain links (SO). The three treatments were applied in a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial design on a commercial farm in seven replicates using seven different units containing eight pens per unit. At five moments in time, ranging from 18 h before until 1 h after treatment, a range of behaviours was recorded including the frequency-related parameter AMI (animal¿material interactions) and four intensity-related parameters. Repeated measures ANOVA's showed significant effects of time and hygiene as well as interactions between time and hygiene, between time and destructibility and between destructibility and sound. Soiling (NH) significantly decreased, and destructibility (DE) significantly increased attractiveness, while sound (SO) was not significant. Only moderate correlations between AMI and the four intensity-related parameters were found (median r = 0. 41, all P < 0. 05), indicating that frequency-related parameters alone may not suffice to determine behavioural importance for animal welfare. This study showed that it is in principle possible to study material properties independent of material type and that it is in principle possible to measure behavioural intensities on a commercial farm. Furthermore, the finding that hygiene and destructibility were more important for pigs than tinkling sounds provided preliminary support for the RICHPIG model...|$|R

Soil nitrogen is an essential macronutrient, and its uptake, assimilation and metabolism are influenced by nutrient availability and by lights. To understand the role of HY 5 in nitrogen assimilation pathways, we examined the phenotype as well as the expression of selected nitrogen assimilation-related genes in hy 5 mutant grown under various nitrogen limiting and nitrogen sufficient conditions, or different light conditions. We report that HY 5 positively regulates nitrite reductase gene NIR 1 and negatively regulates the ammonium transporter gene AMT 1; 2 under all nitrogen and light conditions tested, while it affects several other genes in a nitrogen supply-dependent manner. <b>HY</b> 5 is <b>not</b> required for light induction of NIR 1, AMT 1; 2 and NIA genes, but it is necessary for high level expression of NIR 1 and NIA under optimal nutrient and light conditions. In addition, nitrogen deficiency exacerbates the abnormal root system of hy 5.

Recent evidence suggests that excessive production and release of autoreactive T cells from the thymus of lpr/lpr mice might lead to downregulation of CD 4 and CD 8 as a "fail safe " tolerance mechanism that occurs during late thymic or post-thymic development.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Information {{regarding}} {{effects of}} hypohydration (HY) and hyperthermia (HT) on cognition, mood {{and development of}} symptoms is conflicting since the two conditions often confound each other. Further, although obese individuals may have physiological impairments during heat stress, whether psychological impairments occur with HY and HT is unknown. PURPOSE: To assess the independent and combined effects of mild HY and HT on cognition, mood, {{and the development of}} symptoms in obese and non-obese females. METHODS: Twenty-two healthy females (11 non-obese, 22 ± 2 y, 61 ± 6 kg, 25 ± 4 % body fat; 11 obese, 22 ± 2 y, 80 ± 18 kg, 44 ± 5 % body fat) volunteered in two randomized, repeated-measures trials, involving passive heating. 24 -h prior to heat stress, females either remained euhydrated (EU) or became HY via fluid restriction. EU individuals received fluid during heating to maintain euhydration. Percent BM change and blood osmolality along with urine osmolality and specific gravity were measured prior to and after heating. Cognition (ImPACT, VAS, NASA-TLX), mood (Brunel Mood Scale; BRUMS), and symptoms (visual analog scales) were measured before and after a 1. 0 ºC increase in core temperature (TC). RESULTS: Participants started the trials within the designated cut-offs for EU and HY. All HY hydration biomarkers were significantly greater than EU at baseline and when hyperthermic (p 0. 05). HY at baseline impaired Visual Memory and increased temporal demand, frustration, feelings of Depression, and Total Symptom Score (p 0. 05). HT, while remaining EU, impaired Visual Memory and mental task load and led to negative symptoms and mood (p 0. 05). However, participants reported increased temporal demand, Anger, and negative symptoms (p 0. 05). CONCLUSION: These data indicate that HY and HT independently impair Visual Memory, mental task load, and result in development of negative symptoms. <b>HY</b> did <b>not</b> exacerbate the effects of HT on cognition, but greater impairments to mental task load and mood and development of negative symptoms did occur. Body composition does not have an effect on cognition, mood, or the development of negative symptoms with mild HY, mild HT, or when the stressors are combined...|$|R
40|$|The {{interactions}} between Ro and La proteins and hY RNAs have been analysed. The binding {{site for the}} 60 kDa Ro protein on hY RNAs is shown to be the terminal part of the base paired stem structure, which contains the most highly conserved sequence among hY RNAs. The bulged C-residue within this region {{plays an important role}} in the recognition by this protein. The same regions of hY RNAs are essential for the association of the 52 kDa Ro protein with the RNAs, strongly suggesting that the 60 kDa Ro protein is required for the 52 kDa Ro protein to bind, presumably via protein-protein interactions, to Ro RNPs. The binding site for the La protein on hY RNAs is shown to be the oligouridylate stretch near the 3 '-end of the RNAs, which is also recognized when additional nucleotides flank this motif at the 3 '-side. Additional sequence elements in hY 3 and <b>hY</b> 5, but <b>not</b> in <b>hY</b> 1, are bound by the La protein as well. Deletion mutagenesis showed that the RNP motif, previously identified in many ribonucleoprotein (RNP) proteins and in some cases shown to be almost sufficient for the interaction with RNA, of both the 60 kDa Ro and the La protein are not sufficient for the interaction with hY RNAs. Substantial parts of these proteins flanking the RNP motif are needed as well. It is likely that they stabilize the correct conformation of the RNP motif for RNA binding...|$|R
40|$|Ro RNPs are {{evolutionarily}} conserved, small cytoplasmic RNA-protein complexes with {{an unknown}} function. In human cells, Ro RNPs consist {{of one of}} the four hY RNAs and two core proteins: Ro 60 and La. Recently, the association of hnRNP I and hnRNP K with particles containing hY 1 and hY 3 RNAs has been described. The association of three other proteins, namely calreticulin, Ro 52 and RoBPI, with (subsets of) the Ro RNPs is still controversial. To gain more insight into the composition and function of the Ro RNPs, we have immunopurified these particles from HeLa cell extracts using monoclonal antibodies against Ro 60 and La. Using this approach, we have identified the RNA-binding protein nucleolin as a novel subunit of Ro RNP particles containing hY 1 or hY 3 RNA, but <b>not</b> <b>hY</b> 4 and hY 5 RNA. Using an in vitro hY RNA-binding assay we established that the internal pyrimidine-rich loop of hY 1 and hY 3 RNA is essential for the association of nucleolin. The binding is critically dependent on the presence of all four RNP motifs of nucleolin, but not of the C-terminal RGG-box. Moreover, we demonstrate that, in contrast to nucleolin and hnRNP K, nucleolin and hnRNP I can bind simultaneously to the internal pyrimidine-rich loop of hY 1 RNA. We postulate that nucleolin functions in the biogenesis and/or trafficking of hY 1 and hY 3 RNPs through the nucleolus and subsequent transport to the cytoplasm...|$|R

But in Chaucer's telling, the Franklin adapts the style so that it is barely recognisable as a Breton lai. The relationship between the knight and his wife is explored, continuing the theme of marriage which runs through many of the pilgrims' tales. Whereas most of the Breton lais involved magic and fairies, the usual fantastical element is here modified by the use of science to make rocks disappear rather than a spell.

40|$|The Asian {{financial}} crisis is doubly unfortunate, {{first of all}} because it has set income and wealth levels in these countries back some ten years. But, it is also unfortunate because Hy Minsky been alive {{to point out to}} policy makers that they were dealing with a debt deflation the worst excesses might have been prevented. Hy {{spent a good deal of}} time explaining why "It", that is, the Great Depression, Can't Happen Again. But, in this case of Asia it did. And this is also a lesson for why it might happen again, outside the Far East. First, Hy insisted on the beneficial impact of Big Government in providing a floor under aggregate demand. Free falls in asset prices could not happen if there was a guaranteed floor under incomes. The Bigger the Government, the firmer foundation and the stable the economy. Not that this didn't cause other problems, but it meant that you could only go down so far. If we take a look at the vital statistics of the Asian economies, we see in general that they have small governments. And those governments tend to run persistent surpluses. There are no firm foundations here. This is not to say that government played no role. We have heard a lot about ‘crony capitalism' in Asia. But, this sort of income support does not provide the kind of aggregate demand support that Hy thought was beneficial to avoiding instability. Hy also thought that a Big Bank, an active central bank willing to intervene actively by lending at the discount window in support of asset prices, and thus of bank solvency, was of crucial importance. <b>Hy</b> did <b>not</b> believe in tying one's hands or currency boards or other forms of shooting financial markets in the foot. It is true that central banks are common in Asia, and in some countries they are active on the policy front. But, in the current crisis a major portion of the lending to firms and financial institutions was in foreign currency, Yen and US dollars, which meant that the local central bank was constrained in its ability to act as lender of last resort by the size of its dollar reserves. They could not follow the Bagehot principle of lending without limit. Of course, they has the (non) -choice of adopting floating exchange rates, but this would have made their ability to act that much weaker. ...|$|R
40|$|The hyoid arch is {{critical}} in expanding the oral cavity during feeding and ventilation in fishes. The elements of the hyoid arch vary widely in morphology among fish taxa. The hyoid arch is medial to the jaws and {{is made up of}} paired hyomandibular cartilages (HY) dorsally, paired ceratohyal cartilages (CH) ventral to the HY, and a single, medial basihyal cartilage (BH) that interconnects the two sides. As the jaws open, the CH-BH complex is depressed expanding the floor of the oral cavity. The coracohyoideus muscle pulls the BH ventroposteriorly, which in turn swings the CH ventroposteriorly. As the coracohyoideus muscle depresses the BH, the CH experiences substantial bending forces. Because of their critical role in the feeding mechanism, the various shapes of the hyomandibular cartilages among species are likely adapted for different feeding behaviors. The hyoid arch of suction feeders experiences larger forces during rapid hyoid depression and are expected to have robust hyoid elements to withstand muscular forces and strong intraoral negative pressure generated during suction. Bite feeders are expected to have relatively more gracile elements, since strong, rapid jaw adduction that does not involve the hyoid arch is more critical to prey capture. The goal of this project was to test for possible form-function relationships among four shark species with different feeding styles. Shape differences were analyzed using 2 D geometric morphometrics in white-spotted bamboo sharks (Chiloscyllium plagiosum, suction feeder), sandbar sharks (Carcharhinus plumbeus, bite feeder), dusky smoothhound sharks (Mustelus canis, bite feeder), and spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias, bite and suction feeder) to quantify the relationship between the morphology of the hyomandibular cartilage and the feeding mechanism. Landmarks and semilandmarks were digitized on images of the HY. Principal components analysis and canonical variate analysis were applied to distinguish the shapes of elements and to determine changes among different species. While dogfish, which uses both suction and bite to feed, have the most robust HY, bamboo sharks, which only use suction to feed, have the most gracile HY. Bamboo and smoothhound sharks are similar in having a process near the each end of the HY on the posterior/anterior side. The HY of sandbar sharks has a convex curve that bulges outward, while the HY of the other species are relatively straight. Thus, the morphology of the <b>HY</b> does <b>not</b> correspond to feeding style in these four species as expected, but rather may be associated with three-dimensional movements of the hyoid arch during feeding...|$|R

We also investigated the alternative splicing of this gene in the wild-type wheat ecotype by sequence analysis. Free radical contents and total antioxidant capacity significantly increased upon exposure of HY 1 wheat to γ-irradiation in a dose-dependent manner. By contrast, in J 411, the free radical contents exhibited a similar trend, but the total antioxidant capacity exhibited a downward trend upon increasing γ-irradiation. Additionally, we detected dose-dependent increases in TaKu 70 and TaKu 80 expression levels in γ-irradiated HY 1, while in J 411, TaKu 70 expression levels increased, followed by a decline. We also detected alternative splicing of TaKu 70 mRNA, namely, intron retention, in <b>HY</b> 1 but <b>not</b> in J 411. Our findings indicate that γ-irradiation induces oxidative stress and DNA damage in hexaploid wheat, resulting in growth retardation of seedlings, and they suggest that TaKu 70 may play a causal role in radiosensitivity in HY 1. Further studies are required to exploit these factors to improve radiosensitivity in other wheat varieties...|$|R
40|$|CD 8 + T-cell {{responses}} to non-pathogen, cell-associated antigens such as minor alloantigens or peptide-pulsed dendritic cells (DC) are usually strongly dependent on help from CD 4 + T cells. However, {{some studies have}} described help-independent primary CD 8 + T-cell {{responses to}} cell-associated antigens, using immunization strategies likely to trigger natural killer (NK) cell activation and inflammatory cytokine production. We asked whether NK cell activation by MHC I-deficient cells, or administration of inflammatory cytokines, could support CD 4 + T-cell help-independent primary responses to peptide-pulsed DC. Injection of MHC I-deficient cells cross-primed CD 8 + T-cell responses to the protein antigen ovalbumin (OVA) and the male antigen <b>HY,</b> but did <b>not</b> stimulate CD 8 + T-cell responses in CD 4 -depleted mice; hence NK cell stimulation by MHC I-deficient cells did not replace CD 4 + T-cell help in our experiments. Dendritic cells cultured with tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) or type I interferon-α (IFN-α) also failed to prime CD 8 + T-cell responses {{in the absence of}} help. Injection of TNF-α increased lymph node cellularity, but did not generate help-independent CD 8 + T-cell responses. In contrast, CD 4 -depleted mice injected with IFN-α made substantial primary CD 8 + T-cell responses to peptide-pulsed DC. Mice deficient for the type I IFN receptor (IFNR 1) made CD 8 + T-cell responses to IFNR 1 -deficient, peptide-pulsed DC; hence IFN-α {{does not appear to be}} a downstream mediator of CD 4 + T-cell help. We suggest that primary CD 8 + T-cell responses will become help-independent whenever endogenous IFN-α secretion is stimulated by tissue damage, infection, or autoimmune disease...|$|R
40|$|Carotenoids are {{photosynthetic}} pigments {{essential for}} the protection against excess light. During deetiolation, their production is regulated by a dynamic repression-activation module formed by PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 1 (PIF 1) and LONG HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY 5). These transcription factors directly and oppositely control {{the expression of the}} gene encoding PHYTOENE SYNTHASE (PSY), the first and main rate-determining enzyme of the carotenoid pathway. Antagonistic modules also regulate the responses of deetiolated plants to vegetation proximity and shade (i. e. to the perception of far-red light-enriched light filtered through or reflected from neighboring plants). These responses, aimed to adapt to eventual shading from plant competitors, include a reduced accumulation of carotenoids. Here, we show that PIF 1 and related photolabile PIFs (but not photostable PIF 7) promote the shade-triggered decrease in carotenoid accumulation. While <b>HY</b> 5 does <b>not</b> appear to be required for this process, other known PIF antagonists were found to modulate the expression of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) PSY gene and the biosynthesis of carotenoids early after exposure to shade. In particular, PHYTOCHROME-RAPIDLY REGULATED 1, a transcriptional cofactor that prevents the binding of true transcription factors to their target promoters, was found to interact with PIF 1 and hence directly induce PSY expression. By contrast, a change in the levels of the transcriptional cofactor LONG HYPOCOTYL IN FAR RED 1, which also binds to PIF 1 and other PIFs to regulate shade-related elongation responses, did not impact PSY expression or carotenoid accumulation. Our data suggest that the fine-regulation of carotenoid biosynthesis in response to shade relies on specific modules of antagonistic transcriptional factors and cofactors...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Efficient {{incorporation}} of the cellular cytidine deaminase APOBEC 3 G (APO 3 G) into HIV- 1 virions is necessary for its antiviral activity. Even though cellular RNAs {{are known to be}} non-specifically incorporated into virus particles, we have previously found that encapsidation of APO 3 G into HIV- 1 virions is specifically enhanced by viral genomic RNA. Intracellularly, APO 3 G was found to form large RNA-protein complexes involving a variety of cellular RNAs. The goal {{of this study was to}} investigate the possible contribution of host RNAs recently identified in intracellular APO 3 G ribonucleoprotein complexes to APO 3 G's encapsidation into HIV- 1 virions. Results Our results show that 7 SL RNA, a component of signal recognition particles, and hY 1, hY 3, hY 4, hY 5 RNAs were present in intracellular APO 3 G complexes and were packaged into HIV- 1 particles lacking viral genomic RNA unlike APO 3 G, which was not packaged in significant amounts into genomic RNA-deficient particles. These results indicate that packaging of 7 SL or <b>hY</b> RNAs is <b>not</b> sufficient for the packaging of APO 3 G into HIV- 1 virions. We also tested the encapsidation of several other cellular RNAs including β-actin, GAPDH, α-tubulin, and small nuclear RNAs and determined their effect on the packaging of APO 3 G into nascent virions. Again, we were unable to observe any correlation between APO 3 G encapsidation and the packaging of any of these cellular RNAs. Conclusion The results from this study support our previous conclusion that viral genomic RNA is a critical determinant for APO 3 G incorporation into HIV- 1 virions. While most cellular RNAs tested in this study were packaged into viruses or virus-like particles we failed to identify a correlation between APO 3 G encapsidation and the packaging of these cellular RNAs. </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:Pain in Parkinson's {{disease is}} a very {{frequent}} complaint and may precede the diagnoses of the disease. This study aimed at evaluating pain {{in a group of}} Parkinson's disease patients from a specialized treatment center. METHODS:This is a observational study of pain in Parkinson's disease patients from the Clinicas Hospital, Federal University of Pernambuco. The convenience sample, obtained between July and August 2011, was made up of 24 individuals, being 17 males and 7 females, aged between 42 and 50 (mean= 64. 3) years, and 48 and 66 (mean= 58. 7) years, respectively. Section III of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Hoehn and Yahr (HY) scale according to the stage of the disease, McGill pain questionnaire and Mini Mental State Examination were used. RESULTS:Specific body region with most frequent pain was lumbar spine (50 %). Categorized regions with highest complaint percentages were: trunk (66. 7 %) and limbs (37. 5 % upper; 37. 5 % lower). Most patients have referred pain in a single body region, regardless of analyzing specific or categorized regions (37. 5 %). There has been no significant difference in proportional scores obtained by each McGill questionnaire score component. Patients with rigid-akinetic Parkinson's disease had higher number of painful body regions. The comparison among McGill indices, according to predominant symptom and according to Parkinson's disease stage (<b>HY)</b> scores has <b>not</b> shown significant differences. CONCLUSION:In our study, all Parkinson's disease patients have referred pain. Although pain {{is one of the most}} frequent non-motor symptoms, many aspects regarding Parkinson's disease-related pain need further investigation, such as which would be the best pain categorization and which methodology could better distinguish different mechanisms of different types of pain...|$|R
40|$|The {{diversity}} of antigen receptors in the adap-tive immune system of vertebrates {{is generated by}} a random recombinatorial process, and thus receptors recognizing self-antigens are constantly generated, creating a risk of autoimmunity. Therefore, the immune system requires an array of mechanisms to disarm autoreactive lympho-cytes. This includes negative selection, induction of anergy, diversion to lineages with regulatory properties, and antigen receptor editing. Receptor editing {{is a process of}} secondary rearrangements of antigen receptor genes in response to recognition of self-antigen. This phe-nomenon is well described for B cells (Nemazee and Hogquist, 2003); however, its role in T cell tolerance remains controversial (Mostoslavsky and Alt, 2004), {{in part because of the}} lack of an appropriate mouse model. Indirect experi-ments using mice expressing TCR transgenes that were not contained within endogenous TCR loci suggested that editing may exist because T cells with receptors specific for peptide ligands expressed in the thymic cortex appeared to undergo rearrangements of the endogenous Tcra locus (McGargill et al., 2000). In this setting, endogenous TCR chains have to compete with the transgenic TCR for pairing with TCR chains. The varying efficiency of such competi-tion for different TCR transgenes may explain the fact that OT-I, but <b>not</b> <b>HY</b> or 2 C TCRs, allowed for the appearance of transgene-negative, TCR-positive cells in the presence of antigen (Mayerova and Hogquist, 2004). Other studies have suggested that editing may even take place after thymic egress and peripheral antigens could induce TCR rearrangements in peripheral T cells specific for these antigens (McMahan and Fink, 1998). More direct experiments in which a rearranged VJ exon of the HY TCR chain was knocked-in into the Tcra locus in a way that mimics the product of physiological VJ rearrangement (HY-I mouse), and thus could be deleted by secondary rearrangements, indicated, however, an absence of TCR editin...|$|R
40|$|The major {{point of}} the study was into how the penumococcus copes with {{reactive}} derivatives of oxygen. Superoxide dismutase is one of the enzymes that provides protection against deleterious effects of superoxide radical by conversion of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen. In this study, it was shown that S. pneumoniae contains two types of superoxide dismutase, MnSOD and FeSOD. While the level of MnSOD increased during growth in an aerobic environment, the amount of FeSOD remained unchanged. An isogenic sodA insertion-mutant strain of S. pneumoniae was constructed to study the role for the enzyme in vitro and in vivo. Aerobically the mutant strain of S. pneumoniae, designated as D 39 HY 1, had a lower growth rate than the wild type and exhibited susceptibility to the redox active compound, paraquat. Anaerobic growth of D 39 HY 1 was identical to the wild-type. Virulence studies showed that the median survival time of mice infected intranasally with D 39 HY 1 was significantly longer than mice infected with the wild type pneumococcus. In contrast to the wild-type, D 39 <b>HY</b> 1 did <b>not</b> multiply in lungs during the first 24 h but thereafter grew {{at the same rate as}} the wild-type. Appearance in the bloodstream also was delayed but growth in the blood was unimpaired by the sodA mutation.;The aim of the second project was to assess whether IFN- may enhance resistance of macrophages to the deleterious effects of bacterial products. To assess this possibility, the effects of interferon gamma on sensitivity of phagocytes to the toxin pneumolysin, an important virulence determinant of S. pneumoniae, was tested by employing respiratory burst as an assay of sublytic effects. It was observed that IFN- can alter the susceptibility of cells to the lytic effect of pneumolysin. Also the respiratory burst of IFN- treated cells was insensitive to sublytic concentrations of pneumolysin...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} was conducted using 95 Continental crossbred steers. The cattle were sorted by ultrasound 160 days before slaughter into a low backfat group (Low BF) {{and a higher}} backfat group (High BF). Half of the Low BF {{and half of the}} High BF were implanted whereas the other halves were not. Data from the experiment were used in two hypothetical markets. One market was a high yield beef program (<b>HY)</b> that did <b>not</b> allow the use of implants. The second market was a commodity beef program (CM) that allowed the use of implants. The cattle were priced as an unsorted group (ALL) and two sorted groups (Low BF and High BF) within the HY (non-implanted) and CM (implanted) markets. The CM program had a base price of $ 1. 05 /lb hot carcass weight (HCW) with a $ 0. 15 /lb HCW discount for quality grade (QG) Select and a $ 0. 20 /lb HCW discount for yield grade (YG) 4. The HY program used a base price of $ 1. 07 /lb HCW with premiums ($/lb HCW) paid for YG £. 9 (. 15), 1. 0 - 1. 4 (. 10), and 1. 5 - 1. 9 (. 03). The carcasses were discounted ($/lb HCW) for YG 2. 5 - 2. 9 (. 03), 3. 0 - 3. 9 (. 15), and ³ 4. 0 (. 35). This data set provides good evidence that the end point at which to sell a group of cattle depends on the particular market. Sorting had an economic advantage over ALL in the HY Low BF and the CM High BF groups. The HY High BF cattle should have been sold sooner due to the discounts recieved for increased YG. The increased YG was directly affected by an increase in BF. Furthermore, the CM Low BF group should have been fed longer {{to increase the number of}} carcasses grading Choice...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effects race, sex and sleep disturbance have on the severity of Parkinson’s disease as assessed by the Hoehn Yahr (HY) score in both the medicated (ON) and non-medicated (OFF) states. The potentially confounding variables of age, time in years from the onset of symptoms to database entry, and education were taken into account. Secondary analysis was also conducted to determine how the non-motor symptoms of dementia, hallucinations and autonomic dysfunction impacted Hoehn Yahr ON and OFF scores. 	This study used the statistical techniques of the Student’s t-test, ANOVA, Tukey-Kramer test, univariate linear regression, and multivariate regression. The t-tests and ANOVA test revealed that there was no significant differences in mean HY ON and OFF scores between the sexes, patients with and without sleep disturbance, and between the different races analyzed in this study. Patients with and without sleep disturbance did show significantly higher HY ON scores as compared to HY OFF scores, which is peculiar as this finding suggests that these patients are not responding to their medication. The univariate linear regression models did show, however, that time in years from the onset of symptoms to database entry did significantly impact both HY ON and OFF scores, whereas age is only shown to have a significant impact on HY OFF scores. Additionally, the univariate linear regression model analyzing the association between education and HY OFF scores showed that having some high school education, but not receiving a degree, was associated with an increase in HY OFF scores. 	Several multivariate linear regression models where built to assess the impact different predictor variables had on HY ON and HY OFF scores. The first two multivariate models used the predictor variables of age, race, and time in years from the onset of symptoms until database entry. These models showed that only time in years from the onset of symptoms until database entry impacted HY ON scores, whereas all three of these predictor variables impacted HY OFF scores. Two additional multivariate linear regression models were built to assess how age, race, time in years from the onset of symptoms until database entry, dementia, autonomic dysfunction and hallucinations all impacted HY ON and OFF scores. These models revealed that all of these predictors, when taken together, significantly impacted HY OFF scores, but <b>not</b> <b>HY</b> ON scores. 	Finally a scatter plot was made comparing HY ON and HY OFF scores. A LOWESS scatter plot smooth line was also superimposed on top of this plot to show the overall trend these scores had on one another. This scatter plot was interesting because it suggested that there were two spate groups of patients contained in this database, those that responded well to medication and those that did not. 	Overall, this study showed that age, time in years from the onset of symptoms until database entry, education and race impacted HY OFF scores. Furthermore, the analysis indicated that patients who were asked about sleep disturbance did not appear to be responding to medication. There are several limitations to this study, however, with the most important being missing data and the cross-sectional design. Missing data prevented sleep disturbance from being thoroughly analyzed and the cross-sectional design does not allow for any causal relationships to be determined...|$|R
40|$|Due {{to concern}} about {{possible}} {{negative effects of}} systemic chemotherapy on cognitive function (i. e. memory and concentration), these functions in cancer patients after such treatment have received increasing clinical and public attention. However, in 2005, {{at the onset of}} the research project leading to this thesis, no neuropsychological studies had been published on cognitive function in testicular cancer patients (TCPs) after systemic chemotherapy. TCPs in general are young and have a favorable prognosis. Hence, most patients have a long life expectancy after their malignancy, and they are expected to resume a regular professional and familial life after treatment. Cisplatin, the cornerstone of chemotherapy for testicular cancer, has well-known toxic effects on the peripheral nervous system. Therefore we considered systematic assessment of cognitive function in TCPs treated with chemotherapy to be of considerable importance, both for the patients and for future clinical work. The main aim of this thesis was to explore cognitive function in TCPs. In the period from 2006 to 2009 we therefore conducted a prospective study of cognitive function in TCPs evaluated and treated at the Norwegian Radium Hospital and the Ullevaal University Hospital (now both parts of the Oslo University Hospital). This thesis also includes a prospective study on self-reported cognitive complaints in TCPs included in three European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer Organization (EORTC) / Medical Research Council (MRC) treatment studies done during the 1990 ’ies, before the associations between chemotherapy and reduced cognitive function became a public concern. In paper I (the 1990 ’ies study) self-reported cognitive complaints in TCPs treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy during the 1990 ’ies are prospectively explored. We found no significant difference between the chemotherapy and the radiotherapy group in prevalence of cognitive complaints at one-year follow-up. Treatment modality was not significantly associated with cognitive complaints at any time point after adjustment for QoL domains such as emotional function and fatigue. Paper II-IV reports results from our prospective study of cognitive function in TCPs, conducted at the Oslo University Hospital (“The Oslo-study”). In paper II (the distress paper) we explored the level of emotional distress shortly after the diagnosis of TC (at the baseline evaluation of our study), and investigated whether current level of distress had any impact on the neuropsychological test results at that time-point. About one-fourth of the TCPs had clinically significant distress at baseline. However, we found that the majority of neuropsychological test scores (14 out of 18) were not significantly associated with levels of emotional distress. In paper III (the neuropsychological paper) we compared the proportions of TCPs in three treatment groups (no chemotherapy, one cycle of chemotherapy, and multiple cycles of chemotherapy) with changes in neuropsychological test performance from baseline (pretreatment) to one year follow-up. No significant group differences in proportions of TCPs with a decline in neuropsychological test performance from baseline to follow-up were observed. In paper IV (the self-report paper) we prospectively explored self-reported cognitive complaints in TCPs. Increase of cognitive complaints from baseline to one-year follow-up was significantly associated with levels of emotional distress and fatigue and treatment with chemotherapy, but not with a decline in neuropsychological test performance. From the findings presented in this thesis we conclude that cisplatin-based chemotherapy does not seem to have a negative impact on neuropsychological test performance in TCPs at one year follow-up. However, this finding should be confirmed in larger prospective studies before definite conclusions can be made. Self-reported cognitive complaints were not associated with neuropsychological test performance in our study, but were related to current emotional distress and fatigue. For TCPs treated in the 1990 <b>’ies,</b> chemotherapy was <b>not</b> a significant predictor of post-treatment cognitive complaints after adjustment for emotional function and fatigue...|$|R
