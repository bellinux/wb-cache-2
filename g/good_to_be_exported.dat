40|$|The {{following}} {{web link}} {{provides access to}} the second revised draft of the Cancun Ministerial text of September 13 th 2003. Annex A of this text contains the proposals for the framework for agricultural modalities. This text was not adopted in Cancun. There was substantial disagreement on agricultural issues, with the EU strongly emphasising the importance of distinguishing between the trade-distorting effects {{of different types of}} support, and maintaining that not all forms of support were bad and that the EU had increasingly shifted over to less trade-distorting and non-trade-distorting forms of support, which it felt should not be subjected to any WTO disciplines. The USA for its part was unwilling to address the west and central African concerns in the cotton sector in the form favoured by these governments, preferring instead to discuss broader issues of market access for clothing and textile products using both cotton and man-made fibre. Comment: This struck {{at the heart of the}} debate on domestic agricultural support in OECD countries, by challenging a major policy plank in an area which clearly had adverse effect on some of the poorest developing countries. In this context the strong position taken by the Group of 21, led by Brazil, India and China, with heavyweights such as Egypt also joining in, was always going to lead to head-on disagreement. The Group of 21 put forward a framework proposal calling for more extensive cuts in domestic support and less stringent access commitments for developing countries. This proposal signalled a readiness to fight for major changes in the draft text put forward, particularly in the area of domestic support for agriculture. The G 21 in particular objected to the draft text's willingness to protect US and EU subsidies in the 'blue box' category, which covers subsidies linked to production restraint. The G 21 paper called for the elimination of the blue box and tighter disciplines on domestic support for products which are primarily exported (the modification on June 26 th 2003 of the Commission's initial CAP-reform proposals made it more difficult for the EU to agree to these types of proposals). These proposals were intended to target the dumping of commodities by rich countries where subsidies allow the <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>exported</b> at below the production costs of the developed country. On market access the G 21 called for developing countries to agree to minimum and average reductions to all tariffs but with developed countries subject to much more significant tariff reductions. The G 21 proposal also suggested different 'special and differential treatment' rules for net food-importing developing countries. The EU criticised the G 21 paper as 'flawed' since it asked developed countries to make concessions while little was asked of developing countries. This, Commission spokespersons maintained, was unrealistic. The following web link provides access to the second revised draft of the [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} trade and the {{environment}} overwhelmingly focus on how trade affects where goods are produced. However, trade also affects where goods are consumed. In this paper we describe a model of trade with durable goods and non-chomothetic preferences. In autarky, used goods are relatively inexpensive in high-income countries and free trade causes these <b>goods</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>exported</b> <b>to</b> low-income countries. We then evaluate the environmental consequences of this pattern of trade using evidence from the North American Free Trade Agreement. Since trade restrictions were eliminated in 2005, over 2. 5 million used cars have <b>been</b> <b>exported</b> from the United States to Mexico. Using a unique, vehicle-level dataset, we find that traded vehicles are dirtier than the stock of vehicles in the United States and cleaner than the stock in Mexico, so trade leads average vehicle emissions to decrease in both countries.

5|$|Refrigerated {{ships were}} also made {{possible}} {{through the ice}} trade, allowing perishable <b>goods</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>exported</b> internationally, first from the U.S. and then from countries such as Argentina and Australia. Early ships had stored their chilled goods along with the main cargo of ice; the first ships to transport chilled meat to Britain, designed by Bate, adapted the railroad refrigerator cars, using ice {{at either end of}} the hold and a ventilation fan to keep the meat cool. An improved version, invented by James Craven, piped a brine solution through the ice and then the hold to keep the meat cool, and created a drier atmosphere in the hold, preserving the meat better. Natural ice was also used in fishing industries to preserve catches, initially in the eastern American fisheries. In 1858 the Grimsby fishing fleet began to take ice out to sea with them to preserve their catches; this allowed longer journeys and bigger catches, and the fishing industry became the biggest single user of ice in Britain.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades an {{unprecedented}} increase in private vehicle ownership has taken place in the developing world. This growth is due, in part, to increased international trade in used vehicles. In this paper we use theory and empirical evidence to evaluate the environmental implications of free trade in vehicles and other used durable goods. With non‐homothetic preferences, used vehicles are relatively inexpensive in high‐income countries and free trade causes these <b>goods</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>exported</b> <b>to</b> low‐income countries. We apply this framework to the North American Free Trade Agreement. Since trade restrictions were eliminated in 2005, over 2. 5 million used cars have <b>been</b> <b>exported</b> from the United States to Mexico.

[...] The development of the sugar complex occurred over time, with a variety of models. The dependencies of the farm included a casa-grande (big house) where the owner of the farm lived with his family, and the senzala, where the slaves were kept. A notable early study of this complex is by Brazilian sociologist Gilberto Freyre.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{recent changes}} {{in the structure of}} Argentine exports and the implications for future growth. The authors find that the current export structure of Argentina <b>is</b> not conducive <b>to</b> future growth because it is dominated by low-productivity <b>goods</b> that tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>exported</b> by low-income countries. The productivity content of Argentine exports has increased recently although, as of 2004, these changes have been relatively minor. The authors identify products with characteristics similar to those currently exported by Argentina and which <b>are</b> morelikely <b>to</b> foster growth because they would shift the structure of exports more the efficiency frontier. Those products include chemicals and primary products with some degree of value added, including partly processed meat, fish and grains. If economic growth <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fostered by developing new export products and by increasing the value added of existing <b>exports,</b> there will <b>be</b> a need for sector-specific analysis to address possible market failures. The analysis should focus on issues such as the provision of public goods needed for production (including infrastructure, but also complex intangibles such as sector-specific legislation), possible impediments to effective coordination, sector-specific and economy wide externalities, or barriers to information. This last source of potential market failure <b>is</b> critical <b>to</b> a successful policy framework for exports and growth.

The first profile is a SMST with a dominant 'residential' economy that mostly relies on local activities that meet the needs of people in an area, be they residents, commuters or tourists. The second profile corresponds to a town with a dominant 'productive' economy based on production of <b>goods</b> and services <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>exported</b> and consumed out of its area. The third profile is the one with important share of activities in the 'creative-knowledge' economy that is based on entrepreneurship, creativity and knowledge, and on networks and collaboration in innovation. Furthermore, we suggest that profiles are shifting as SMSTs are making choices between residential economy, competitiveness and innovation. As a result, better performance of SMSTs in terms of positive demographic change and job growth is underpinned by a combination of crucial factors: proximity to a large city (access to bigger market), performance of their wider region, skilled resident active population, numerous existing local businesses, etc. By observing and analysing socio-economic dynamics in 30 European towns, this paper seeks to contribute to a scientific discussion on importance of SMSTs for the future development of European territory...|$|R
