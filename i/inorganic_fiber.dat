30|$|There is {{a growing}} desire to improve the {{properties}} and use of nonwood plant materials as supplements to wood materials for wood cement-bonded boards (WCBs). This {{study was conducted to}} determine the comparative properties of WCBs containing various amounts of discontinuous <b>inorganic</b> <b>fiber</b> materials, such as alkali-resistant glass fiber, normal glass fiber, mineral wool, and nonwood plant materials such as retted flax straw and wheat straw particles. Tested cement-bonded boards were made at wood/additive compositions of 100 / 0, 90 / 10, 80 / 20, 70 / 30, 60 / 40, and 50 / 50 (weight percentages). Seventy-eight laboratory-scale WCBs were produced. Various board properties, such as the modulus of rupture (MOR), internal bonding strength (IB), water absorption (WA), thickness swelling (TS), and linear expansion (LE), were studied. The test results showed that three types of discontinuous <b>inorganic</b> <b>fiber</b> used as reinforcing materials in composites significantly enhanced and modified the performance of WCBs. The mechanical properties and dimensional stability of cement-bonded board were significantly improved with increasing amounts of the additives. MOR and IB were increased; and WA, TS, and LE of boards were reduced by combination with the <b>inorganic</b> <b>fiber</b> materials. The results also indicated that combination with retted flax straw particles only slightly increased the MOR of boards, and wheat straw particles led to marked decreases in all the mechanical properties and the dimensional stability of WCBs.|$|E

METHODS: Four groups (suburban schoolchildren, rural retired persons, office workers, and taxi drivers), with five persons per group, were monitored for 24 h four times during one year. Personal sampling pumps collected airborne dust on gold-precoated Nuclepore filters. The fibers were analyzed for fiber sizes specified by the World Health Organization. RESULTS: The geometric mean concentrations ranged from 9000 fibers. m- 3 (office workers) to 20000 fibers. m- 3 (schoolchildren) for organic fibers, and from 600 fibers. m- 3 (taxi drivers) to 4000 fibers. m- 3 (schoolchildren) for gypsum <b>fibers.</b> For other <b>inorganic</b> <b>fibers</b> the concentrations were around 5000 fibers. m- 3. The contribution of fibers with an elemental composition {{similar to that of}} man-made vitreous fibers (MMVF) was less than about one-quarter of the content of other <b>inorganic</b> <b>fibers.</b> The fiber size distributions were uniform across the groups, and the organic fibers were the longest and thinnest nonasbestos fibers.

The <b>inorganic</b> <b>fiber</b> Beta, developed as a result of efforts begun in the early 1960 's and heightened following the January 27, 1967 Apollo fire is unique among inorganic and organic fibers. It has been developed into woven, nonwoven, knitted, braided, coated and printed structures. All of these were used extensively for the Apollo, Skylab, Apollo-Soyuz test project, space shuttle, Spacelab, and satellite programs. In addition to being used successfully in the space program, Beta fibers are being used commercially as firesafe fabrics in homes, hospitals, institutions, public buildings, aircraft, and public transportation, wherever total nonflammability is required. One of the most unique applications of the Beta composite structure is the roofing material for the 80, 000 -seat Detroit Lion's Silverdome and 5 square miles of the Jeddah International Airport in Saudi Arabia.

Such products {{are used in}} advanced engineering applications when reinforced with stronger materials. Among the reinforcements, the fibrous variety, whether continuous or discontinuous, occupies a key position. Hence, many <b>inorganic</b> <b>fiber</b> reinforced polymer system have made their entry at various application levels. Because of their large aspect ratio, they yield components, which have anisotropy when the reinforcements are aligned. In order to secure isentropic properties in composites, reinforcements with near spherical shapes have been tried e. g., glass micro spheres are known as micro balloons. Such man made reinforcements, through yield attractive mechanical properties, are expensive. Hence, a search for cheaper reinforcements is a key subject that needs the attention of material scientists. One such inexpensive filler to fit the slot is red mud. Being a by product of alumina plants, its disposal causes considerable environmental problems. Hence, there is need to tap this inexpensive material for possible use with other system including the polymer based ones. The present study looks at how this pozzolanic red mud, when introduced into a thermoset, responds the exposure to an aqueous medium like laboratory prepared saline water. The results show that when the red mud content in the system is large, the absorption levels are high. The results further revealed that the unexposed samples generally record an increasing strength value with red mud content. ...|$|E

Comparison of these functions at the fixed fiber content has shown that the most effective parameter, affecting the viscoelastic behaviour of organic fiber filled systems, seems to be their rigidity/flexibility in the molten state. The influence of fiber rigidity/flexibility becomes gradually lower with the increase of both strain amplitude and angular frequency. The parameters of the equations describing relationship between relative values of viscoelastic functions and fiber content were found to be largely dependent on fiber content.

The most practical solutions for retrofitting are often those that minimize the risk of structural collapse which can be done by upgrading selected critical structural components. Usage of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) reinforcement in structural engineering has getting more attention because of high tensile strength, light weight and non-corrosive property and many more advantages of it.

There is conflicting evidence whether they act by inducing lesions in DNA, such as initiating carcinogens, or alternatively act as promoters of carcinogenesis. Recent evidence has suggested that promoters inhibit the process of cell-to-cell chemical communication known as metabolic cooperation. Chinese hamster V 79 - 4 cells in culture exhibit metabolic cooperation which can be blocked by the promoter tetraphorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA). Three kinds of mineral dust were tested {{to determine whether or}} not they could interfere with the intercellular communication.

40|$|To {{improve the}} crack-resistance of the mould for silica sol bonded quartz based ceramic mould casting, {{aluminum}} silicate fibers with the diameter ranging from 5 µm to 25 µm {{and the length}} about 1 mm were dispersed in the ceramic mould. The effect of the aluminum silicate fibers on the tensile strength, shrinkage rate and the cracking trend of the ceramic mould were investigated. In the ceramic slurry, quartz sand was applied as ceramic aggregate, silica sol containing 30 % silicon dioxide as bonder, and the weight ratio of quartz sand to silica sol was 2. 69; the dispersed fibers changed from 0 to 0. 24 vol. %. The mould samples were formed after the slurry was poured and gelled at room temperature, and then sintered at different temperatures ranging from 100 to 800 ℃ to measure the tensile strength and shrinkage rate. The results show that, with the aluminum silicate fiber addition increasing from 0 to 0. 24 vol. %, the tensile strength increases linearly from 0. 175 MPa to 0. 236 MPa, and the shrinkage rate decreases linearly from 1. 75 % to 1. 68 % for the ceramic mould sintered at 400 ℃, from 1. 37 % to 1. 31 % for the ceramic mould at room temperature. As the sintering temperature was raised from 100 ℃ to 800 ℃, the tensile strength increases, and the shrinkage rate decreases at all temperatures, compared with those without fiber dispersion, but their variation patterns remain the same. Furthermore, the cracking trend of the mould and its decreasing proportion were defined and analyzed quantitatively considering both effects of the fiber dispersion on the strength and shrinkage. The cracking trend appears to decrease linearly with increasing fiber content and to reach the maximum reduction of 28. 8 % when 0. 24 vol. % fiber was dispersed.

A preliminary study with the use of gastric juice showed that gastric juice is a less sensitive sample for evaluating fiber concentration in lung. The microfiltration method for the counting of uncoated fibers gave results as accurate as those in the centrifugation method. Among the numerous methods now available for study of microparticles in biological specimens and air samples (1 - 8), the quantitative microfiltration method seems {{to be a very good}} means for screening asbestos bodies or asbestos fibers in many biological specimens. The Microfiltration Method The processing of microfiltration after chemical digestion (9) is a very simple one that can be easily carried out on all biological specimens. The ferruginous bodies (FB) and uncoate...|$|R
40|$|AbstractGeopolymers are {{representing}} {{the most promising}} green and eco-friendly alternative to ordinary Portland cement and cementitious materials, thanks to their proven durability, mechanical and thermal properties. However, despite these features, the poor tensile and bending strengths usually exhibited by geopolymers due to their brittle and ceramic-like nature, can easily lead to catastrophic failure and represent the main drawback limiting the use of those materials in several applications. Fiber reinforced geopolymer composites may be considered a solution to improve flexural strength and fracture toughness. Different types of dispersed short fibers are here investigated as a reinforcing fraction for a geopolymer matrix based on an alkali-activated ladle-slag. It has been demonstrated that both organic and <b>inorganic</b> <b>fibers</b> {{can lead to a}} significant flexural strength enhancement. Moreover, the investigated geopolymers exhibit an increase in toughness, thus determining a switch from a brittle failure mode to a more ductile one...|$|R
40|$|ZnO and Ce-doped ZnO Nanofibers on (111) Pt/SiO 2 /Si {{substrates}} {{were produced}} using an electrospinning technique. The as-prepared composite fibres {{were subjected to}} high-temperature calcination to produce <b>inorganic</b> <b>fibers.</b> After calcining at a temperature of 500 °C, the average diameter of the ZnO and Ce-doped ZnO nanofibers were determined to be 170 nm and 225 nm, respectively. The average grain size of the ZnO and Ce-doped ZnO nanofibers were about 50 nm and 57 nm, respectively. The microstructure, chemical bonding state and photoluminescence of the produced ZnO and Ce-doped ZnO nanofibers were investigated. The Ce-doped ZnO nanofiber can be assigned {{to the presence of}} Ce ions on substitutional sites of Zn ions and the Ce 3 + state from X-ray photoelectron spectra. Compared with PL spectra of ZnO nanofibers, the peak position of the UV emission of the Ce-doped ZnO nanofibers is sharply suppressed while the green emission band is highly enhanced...|$|R
