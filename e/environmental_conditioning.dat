Durante muito tempo a maçã foi um dos principais produtos agrícolas importados pelo país, perdendo apenas para o trigo, situação tal que começou a se alterar a partir da década de 1960, quando, no município de Fraiburgo, foi criada em 1962 a Sociedade Agrícola Fraiburgo (SAFRA). A Sociedade, inicialmente destinada a produção de uvas e vinhos, pretendeu na década de 1960 expandir a experiência no cultivo de outras frutas, dentre elas a maçã. Para isso, criou em 1963 um pomar experimental de fruticultura para estudar seu comportamento e a viabilidade econômica para o cultivo comercial. Resultados preliminares em 1968 apontaram a maçã como a fruta mais viável. E no final da década de 1960 se iniciou o plantio comercial de maçãs, plantio que não foi estimulado apenas por resultados técnicos, mas também por interesses econômicos e ligações políticas do grupo Safra e dos Frey. Na modernidade, pode-se compreender que fatores ambientais e sócioeconômicos colocam o Brasil em uma boa situação no ranking mundial de comércio e cultivo de maçãs.

40|$|Abstract: Carbon fiber {{reinforced}} polymer (CFRP) laminates are externally {{bonded to}} reinforced concrete (RC) members {{to provide additional}} strength such as flexural, shear, etc. However, the presence of defects {{in the form of}} delaminations between the CFRP laminate and concrete substrate may significantly affect the structural integrity and stiffness of the structural section. Microwave near-field nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques, utilizing open-ended rectangular waveguides, have the ability to detect these defects. This paper presents the results of an investigation on the influence of cyclic loading on delaminations in reinforced concrete beams fabricated and strengthened with CFRP laminates. The delaminations were formed in the beams by applying pressured air beneath CFRP sheets when epoxy was in fresh state. The beams were exposed to severe <b>environmental</b> <b>conditionings</b> and sustained load of 40 % of the ultimate moment capacity. All the beams were cycled under fatigue loading for 2 -million cycles. A microwave reflectometer and an automated scanner were used in order to study the behaviour of the delaminations under cyclic loading. Introduction & Background: The development of new material systems like carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) used for strengthening and rehabilitation of existing structures are getting higher demands and wide range of applications in recent years. CFRP laminates gained importance over steel plate bonding because they offer superior performance such as resistance to corrosion, and high stiffness-to-weight ratio. Even though CFR...|$|R

During this period a severe drought occurred (2005), with consequent lower freshwater runoff and higher salinity incursion into the estuary. Occasional abnormal high water temperatures were observed in 2003 and 2005. The fish populations were sampled monthly along an estuarine gradient, from which population density, structure, growth and biomass production was assessed. Pomatoschistus minutus distributed mainly at the most saline downstream area, while P. microps distributed within the whole estuary, in accordance to the salinity and temperature tolerances for the species. A clear decrease in density and production was observed for P. minutus in the dry year, with non-expressive recruitments and the quick disappearance of the parental cohort. For P. microps, the decrease was not so pronounced. No direct effects were attributable to the salinity and temperatures variations (resulting from the drought and high temperatures). Yet, higher predation pressure on P. minutus hypothesis was raised, as the salinity incursion increased the piscivorous marine adventitious species in the downstream areas. Pomatoschistus microps benefited from a wider temperature and salinity range tolerance, allowing the species to occupy different areas in the estuary and by this seemed better able to cope with the <b>environmental</b> <b>conditionings</b> during the 3 -year studied period.

The economic growth of countries is obviously uneven. Despite the convergence theory, similar <b>environmental</b> <b>conditionings,</b> economic regimes etc. —the economic performances might be very different, what can be noticed in the examples of Greece, Portugal, Hungary and many others.

The basic factors in economic growth Economic growth is usually taken to refer to an increase in a nation’s capacity to produce goods and services. Among the basic factors underlying this phenomena, the most obvious is productivity, which directly affects the level of GDP.

40|$|Fibre {{reinforced}} polymer(FRP) composites {{are one of}} {{the most}} commonly used materials due to their adaptability to diverse environmental conditions and the comparative ease of combination with different materials to perform definite purposes and reveal advantageous properties. The components made up of fibre reinforced polymeric composites are exposed to temperature variations (thermal shock, thermal spike, low temperature environment, high temperature environment, freeze thaw), humidity variations, UV radiation and often the combined exposure of these environments leads to more detrimental effect on the performance of the composites during fabrication, in-service time and storage. Further, rate of loading can significantly change the mode of failure. The present experimental investigation deals with the mechanical behavior of FRP composites exposed at low temperature and thermal spiking conditioning with different loading rate and holding time. The glass/epoxy samples are exposed to ambient temperature, - 20 °C, - 40 °C and - 60 °C temperatures and tested in 3 -point bending test at 1, 10, 100, 300, 600, 1000 mm/min loading rates.
