5|$|Flanders felt that, {{to quell}} inflation, wage {{increases}} should {{be tied to}} productivity increases, rather {{than the cost of}} living. He recommended splitting gains in productivity three ways: to the worker for higher wages, to the company for higher profits and to the consumer for lower prices. He felt that with this approach <b>everyone</b> <b>would</b> benefit at the company level and in the national economy. Such an approach would require mutual respect and understanding between labor and management.|$|E
5|$|An {{average of}} 23.2 million viewers in the United Kingdom watched the event, with an {{estimated}} 750 million worldwide. Critics were generally positive, but noted {{that it was not}} as good as the opening ceremony. Some of the foreign reviews questioned whether <b>everyone</b> <b>would</b> have understood the nods to British film and television. George Michael was roundly criticised for his song choice while Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell and Russell Brand were criticised for not demonstrating the Olympic ethos in their past behaviour. Some performers were initially reluctant to appear, and other high-profile acts turned down invitations to perform at the ceremony. NBC in the United States and Prime TV in New Zealand were criticised by viewers for their broadcasts of the ceremony. There was also a concert in Hyde Park to close the Olympics, featuring Blur, New Order, and The Specials.|$|E

Under the cover of darkness, troops attended to vital maintenance and resupply, with rations and water being brought to the front line, fresh units swapped places with troops moving to the rear for rest and recuperation. Trench raiding was also carried out and construction parties formed to repair trenches and fortifications, while wiring parties were sent out to repair or renew the barbed wire in no man's land. An hour before dawn, <b>everyone</b> <b>would</b> stand-to once more.|$|E

5|$|The {{rivalry between}} Rey Mysterio and CM Punk was {{continued}} from several previous pay-per-views. After months of feuding, Mysterio challenged Punk to a Straight Edge Society Pledge vs. Hair match at Over the Limit. Had Punk won, Mysterio would {{have joined the}} Straight Edge Society, Punk's faction which promoted the straight edge lifestyle. Had Mysterio won however, Punk agreed to have his head shaved. On May 14, Mysterio and Punk faced {{each other in a}} singles match, but the Straight Edge Society (Luke Gallows, Serena, and a mystery masked man) interfered and attacked Mysterio. The following week, Mysterio interrupted an initiation ceremony, in which Punk was shaving the heads of three men to induct them into the Straight Edge Society, and mocked Punk, claiming <b>everyone</b> <b>would</b> be laughing at Punk when he was shaved bald at Over the Limit. Later that night, Mysterio teamed with Montel Vontavious Porter to defeat Punk and Gallows in a tag team match.|$|E

25|$|At Ongaroto {{the company}} built a large timber bridge of locally sourced totara, {{designed}} by Public Works Department engineer Frederick Furkert. In later years this timber bridge deteriorated and was condemned, {{but the company}} {{could not afford to}} replace it immediately because its sawmill had burned down in 1928. In the last few years of service, trains arriving at the bridge would stop and the passengers and fireman would walk across while the driver gently opened the throttle and then jumped off. The train would slowly ease across the bridge before being stopped on the other side by the fireman, where <b>everyone</b> <b>would</b> reboard the train. This bridge was replaced in 1931 by a steel truss bridge with a central pier.|$|E
25|$|Rico {{appears as}} the main villain and {{antagonist}} in the 1995 Judge Dredd movie, in which Joe was played by Sylvester Stallone and Rico by Armand Assante. In this version, although they were cloned from identical DNA, they did not look the same. Rico was portrayed as a straightforward psychopath, having {{reached a point where}} he killed the innocent {{on the grounds that the}} division between guilt and innocence was merely a matter of timing and <b>everyone</b> <b>would</b> commit a crime in time. His deviant behavior was attributed to something going wrong in his creation which made him the perfect criminal. They were both friends in school (Joe was unaware of their true kinship, but it is unclear when Rico learned about their connection), but when he became a murderer, Joe judged him and sentenced him to execution, and his death was faked to reassure the public and prevent the truth of the clone program coming to light.|$|E
25|$|The 1st Airborne Division, was not {{involved}} in the Normandy landings and was next in action in Operation Market Garden and the Battle of Arnhem. The 181st would be on the first of three lifts spread over three days. Not <b>everyone</b> <b>would</b> be flying into Arnhem, some including most of the vehicles would come by land. The airborne party included the new commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur Marrable, another nine officers and 104 other ranks, however No. 5 Section with one officer and twenty-three men were the divisional reserve section. The divisions three field ambulances carried enough medical stores for forty-eight hours, and all the gliders were equipped with two folding airborne stretchers and extra blankets. As the airlanding brigade was the first unit to arrive, the 181st would establish a Main Dressing Station (MDS) at Wolfheze to treat any casualties from the landings. They would then move into Arnhem, to take over the municipal hospital. The reserve section was under control of division and was on standby to open an Air Casualty Evacuation Centre at Deelen airfield once that had been secured.|$|E

25|$|In contrast, Byrne and Mclean's {{findings}} differed {{slightly from}} Fairburn et al.s cognitive behavioral model of bulimia nervosa {{in that the}} drive for thinness was the major cause of purging {{as a way of}} controlling weight. In turn, Byrne and Mclean argued that this makes the individual vulnerable to binging, indicating {{that it is not a}} binge-purge cycle but rather a purge-binge cycle in that purging comes before bingeing. Similarly, Fairburn et al.s cognitive behavioral model of bulimia nervosa is not necessarily applicable to every individual and is certainly reductionist. Everyone differs from another, and taking such a complex behavior like bulimia and applying the same one theory to <b>everyone</b> <b>would</b> certainly be invalid. In addition, the cognitive behavioral model of bulimia nervosa is very cultural bound in that it may not be necessarily applicable to cultures outside of the Western society. To evaluate, Fairburn et al..'s model and more generally the cognitive explanation of bulimia nervosa is more descriptive than explanatory, as it does not necessarily explain how bulimia arises. Furthermore, it is difficult to ascertain cause and effect, because it may be that distorted eating leads to distorted cognition rather than vice versa.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, Samhain {{was a time}} to {{take stock}} of the herds and food supplies. Cattle were brought down to the winter {{pastures}} after six months in the higher summer pastures. It was also the time to choose which animals would need to be slaughtered for the winter. This custom is still observed by many who farm and raise livestock because it is when meat will keep since the freeze has come and also since summer grass is gone and free foraging is no longer possible. It is thought that some of the rituals associated with the slaughter have been transferred to other winter holidays. On St. Martin's Day (11 November) in Ireland, an animal – usually a rooster, goose or sheep – would be slaughtered and some of its blood sprinkled on the threshold of the house. It was offered to Saint Martin, who may have taken the place of a god or gods, and it was then eaten as part of a feast. This custom was common in parts of Ireland until the 19th century, and was found in some other parts of Europe. At New Year in the Hebrides, a man dressed in a cowhide would circle the township sunwise. A bit of the hide would be burnt and <b>everyone</b> <b>would</b> breathe in the smoke. These customs were meant to keep away bad luck, and similar customs were found in other Celtic regions.|$|E
25|$|Protagoras {{states that}} he has two good pieces of {{evidence}} that people agree with him. First, people do not rebuke the ugly, dwarfish, and weak, but pity them, because they cannot help being as they are, yet they punish the unjust and generally feel as though someone is responsible for not knowing {{something that can be}} taught (323d). Second, they do instruct people who are unjust and irreligious, hoping to impart goodness in them. He says that parents begin with their children from earliest childhood, and teachers carry on the task. Protagoras notes that none of this is surprising, but what would be surprising is if this were not the case (326e). He closes by addressing Socrates' question why, if virtue is teachable, the sons of virtuous men often lack virtue. Protagoras lays out a thought experiment where a hypothetical city state is resting its survival as such to the skill of flute playing. Being {{the most important thing for}} that society, parents would be eager to teach the skill to their sons. Not <b>everyone</b> <b>would</b> be successful though, as we can imagine, as some would have a greater natural inclination than others and often the son of a good flute player would turn out bad and vice versa. Any of them however, even the bad ones, would be better than an average citizen in the real world which might have never been taught how to play. Same goes for virtue, it is considered so important that everyone is taught to a certain degree, to the point that it seems like a part of human nature while it is not (327b–d).|$|E
