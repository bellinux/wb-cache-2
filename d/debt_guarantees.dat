40|$|This paper compares two {{strategies}} for replicating a put option used to synthetize a <b>debt</b> <b>guarantee</b> contract. The first strategy, super-replication, {{while maintaining the}} portfolio value greater or equal to a target value, minimizes the transaction cost of replicating a debt insurance put option by using dynamic linear programming. The second strategy replicates this put option by maximizing the guarantor's expected utility. A comparative study shows that both strategies give better results than the Leland (1985) method. If we use a risk-adjusted performance metric, the utility-based method performs best when transaction costs are relatively low. When transaction costs are relatively high, the two strategies yield similar results and still outperform Leland's. <b>Debt</b> <b>guarantee</b> Synthetic put option Hedging Replication Transaction costs...|$|R

50|$|The {{overhang}} {{of troubled}} legacy loans stuck on bank balance sheets {{has made it}} difficult for banks to access private markets for new capital and limited their ability to lend. To cleanse bank balance sheets of troubled legacy loans and reduce the overhang of uncertainty associated with these assets, they will attract private capital to purchase eligible legacy loans from participating banks through the provision of FDIC <b>debt</b> <b>guarantees</b> and Treasury equity co-investment. The Treasury Department currently anticipates that approximately half of the TARP resources for legacy assets will be devoted to the Legacy Loans Program, but the program will allow for flexibility to allocate resources for the greatest impact.|$|E

5000|$|Like regular banks, shadow banks provide {{credit and}} {{generally}} increase the liquidity {{of the financial}} sector. Yet unlike their more regulated competitors, they lack access to central bank funding or safety nets such as deposit insurance and <b>debt</b> <b>guarantees.</b> [...] In contrast to traditional banks, shadow banks do not take deposits. Instead, they rely on short-term funding provided either by asset-backed commercial paper or by the repo market, in which borrowers in substance offer collateral as security against a cash loan, through the mechanism of selling the security to a lender and agreeing to repurchase it at an agreed {{time in the future}} for an agreed price. Money market funds do not rely on short-term funding; rather, they are investment pools that provide short-term funding by investing in short-term debt instruments issued by banks, corporations, state and local governments, and other borrowers. The shadow banking sector operates across the American, European, and Chinese financial sectors, and in perceived tax havens worldwide. Shadow banks can be involved in the provision of long-term loans like mortgages, facilitating credit across the financial system by matching investors and borrowers individually or by becoming part of a chain involving numerous entities, some of which may be mainstream banks. Due in part to their specialized structure, shadow banks can sometimes provide credit more cost-efficiently than traditional banks. A headline study by the International Monetary Fund defines the two key functions of the shadow banking system as securitization - to create safe assets, and collateral intermediation - to help reduce counterparty risks and facilitate secured transactions. In the US, prior to the 2008 financial crisis, the shadow banking system had overtaken the regular banking system in supplying loans to various types of borrower; including businesses, home and car buyers, students and credit users. As they are often less risk averse than regular banks, entities from the shadow banking system will sometimes provide loans to borrowers who might otherwise be refused credit. Money market funds are considered more risk averse than regular banks and thus lack this risk characteristic.|$|E

40|$|Liabilities can be {{guaranteed}} {{by a third}} party. Guarantees are arrangements whereby the guarantor commits to pay or assume the liability of another entity (the original debtor) if certain conditions are met (such as inability of the original debtor to pay). Guarantees may include repayments of principal and/or interest payments. A <b>debt</b> <b>guarantee</b> involves three institutional units: original creditor, original debtor, and guarantor. Activation of a <b>debt</b> <b>guarantee</b> creates a new liability and the guarantor now becomes the new debtor. This raises issues on how to treat flows between the original debtor and creditor and between the original debtor and the guarantor (the new debtor). Activation of guarantees affects transactions or other economic flows. Usual cases of guarantees in terms of institutional units involved and motivations may be: (1) government providing guarantees for borrowing by public enterprises or private enterprises (for example, to encourage certain types of activities), (2) financial intermediaries providing guarantees as services for payment of a fee, and (3) parents providing guarantees for their subsidiaries (for example, to cut interest costs). The treatment of flows arising from an activation of guarantees may also need to conside...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two essays in macroeconomics. In the first essay, I explain {{the increase in the}} interbank market credit spreads during the recent financial crisis using a model with endogenous default, in which banks with different default risk borrow at different interest rates. I compare a normal times stationary equilibrium and a crisis times stationary equilibrium. In normal times there is no spread in the interbank market, because the default probability of banks is zero. In crisis times some banks default, and an interbank credit spread arises endogenously. The interbank credit spread is positively correlated with leverage and debt size, and negatively correlated with expected cash flows. Using this framework, I study the effects of equity injections, <b>debt</b> <b>guarantees,</b> and liquidity injections on the interbank credit spreads and on risky projects financed by banks. I find that <b>debt</b> <b>guarantees</b> are effective in reducing interbank credit spreads in times of crisis, but not in stimulating investment. In contrast, interbank credit spreads are relatively unresponsive to injections of equity and of liquidity; however, these policies are successful in stimulating investment. 	In the second essay, I study the capacity of the Taylor principle to guarantee determinacy in the class of New Keynesian models typically used for monetary policy analysis, when firms are not able to index their prices. In a model with labor, capital accumulation, capital adjustment costs, and capital utilization, the necessary conditions for trend inflation to affect determinacy are as follows: trend inflation is above 4 %, firms are not able to index their prices, and the frequency of price changes is less than once a year. Introducing sticky wages, it is possible to find a response to inflation greater or equal than one that guarantees determinacy; however, the determinacy region is small and indeterminacy can arise even when the response to inflation is higher than one for one.
