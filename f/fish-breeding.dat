50|$|Aquaculture in China began {{before the}} 1st {{millennium}} BC with the farming {{of the common}} carp. These carp were grown in ponds on silk farms, and were fed silkworm nymphs and faeces. Carp are native to China. They are good to eat, and {{they are easy to}} farm since they are prolific breeders, do not eat their young, and grow fast. The original idea that carp could be cultured most likely arose when they were washed into ponds and paddy fields during monsoons. This would lead naturally to the idea of stocking ponds. The Chinese politician Fan Li was credited with authorship of The <b>Fish-Breeding</b> Classic, the earliest-known treatise on fish farming.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, farmers formed the {{majority}} of the city population. The group of craftsmen was mainly formed by shoemakers, tailors, blacksmiths, weavers, carpenters and potters. The stream-mill and the stream-sawmill contributed significantly {{to the development of the}} local industry. There was also an alcohol distillery, a brewery and a standard brick-yard. The local sawmill (with the power of 30 horses) produced pine-, oak- and ash- boards and flooring blocks. It used 2300 cubic meters of wood for 1500 cubic meters of the final product. There used to be a famous tan-yard in the beginning of the 19th century. Later, the tanning industry was not so common. In the 16th century, they used to make swords in this city. In the same century, there used to be a famous weaving-mill here. We can learn from the book of rights granted to the city in 1589 by the king of Poland, Sigismund III Vasa, that the following guilds operated in Kamianka Strumilowa: the guild of furriers, shoemakers, weavers, blacksmiths, tinsel-makers, locksmiths, coopers, fishermen, armourers, paper-mill workers, haberdashers, carpenters and turners. In the late 19th century, some of these guilds did not exist, some deteriorated. Actually, the entire local industry deteriorated. The residents used to make a lot of money from fishery. They fished for eels in the Bug River. The fishermen were granted special privileges by the city government. Those days, there were not any local <b>fish-breeding</b> ponds so the city ceased to make profits on this branch. People used to put rafts into the Bug river. Those days, people did not engage themselves in this activity. They did not engage much in trade either. Local fairs and markets were modest and insignificant. Those days, trade was carried on mainly by Jews. They sold cattle, salt, grain, lumber in the main. They sold also a small amount of fish. Markets were held every Tuesday and Friday. Fairs were held on January 19; on May 8; on September 10. The city assets equalled 162.148 Polish zloty and the liabilities 233 Polish zloty. The city revenue was 7740 Polish zloty in the year of 1881.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To {{investigate}} {{the potential of}} zooplankton productivity in aquatic ecosystems under experimental conditions of the microcosms {{with the use of}} the green fertilizer (vetch-oat grass) and Ekovital. Methodology. The study was conducted under the conditions of model ecosystems (microcosms) installed in <b>fish-breeding</b> ponds. We used a complex of intensification measures (enhancement, inoculation of vetch-oat seed mixture (1 : 1) with Ekovital at quantities of 1. 4; 2. 9; 4. 3 ml/kg (variants D 1, D 2, D 3), followed by sowing the pond beds with the vetch-oat mixture (1 : 1), growing of vetch-oat grass for the green fertilizer). The seeds were sown at a ratio of 70 kg of grains for 1 ha of ponds area. The first control variant (K 1) — without green fertilizer and without preparation. The second control version (K 2) vetch-oat seeds were soaked in the corresponding quantity of water without preparation and after they were sown on the pond bed. The preparation Ekovital contains specific nitrogen-fixing nodule Rhizobium leguminosarum and phosphorus mobilizing Bacillus megaterium- 6 bacteria. Hydrochemical, hydrobiological, fisheries, and statistical studies were conducted according to standard methods. Findings. It was found that the application of Ekovital in a combination with enhancement activities gives an opportunity to obtain a green fertilizer of up to 1. 03 ± 0. 08 t/ha during 40 days for increasing pond ecosystem productivity. The stimulation of zooplankton development gave an opportunity to obtain the maximum biomass of 9. 85 – 31. 78 g/m 3 that was 4 – 16 times higher than in that in the control — 2. 54 – 3. 30 g/m 3. The mean values of zooplankton biomass in the experiments were 4. 30 – 9. 17 g/m 3, that was 3 - 9 times higher than those in the control — 1. 06 – 1. 40 g/m 3. The experimental variants showed a tendency for increasing the share of cladoceran crustaceans. The production of zooplankton organisms was increased to 1834. 8 kg/ha — the level of the most productive breeding ponds of the forest-steppe zone of Ukraine. The potential of natural fish productivity of an aquatic ecosystem based on zooplankton when applying the green fertilizer (vetch-oat grass) and Ekovital showed a 3 – 7 time increase compared to the control. The maximum potential natural fish productivity based on zooplankton was achieved at the level of 152. 90 ± 85. 25 kg/ha in the variant D 2. Originality.

30|$|When dense water sinks to deep or {{intermediate}} layers, {{various kinds}} of materials are also transported. Of particular interest is iron, which is considered the key element in determining biological productivity (Martin and Fitzwater 1989). Thus, the overturning {{can contribute to the}} material cycle and subsequent biological productivity through the supply of nutrients such as iron. It has been recently revealed in the Sea of Okhotsk that when DSW formed by the polynya ice production sinks to the intermediate layer, re-suspended iron from sediment over the continental shelf is also brought to this layer (Nishioka et al. 2013). The iron is considered to originate from the land through the Amur River. One hypothesis says that the iron from DSW is also supplied to the western area of the North Pacific and supports high biological productivity there (Nishioka et al. 2013). As such, the land or the Amur River possibly feeds the ocean through the supply of iron in the western North Pacific. This system is termed the “Giant <b>Fish-Breeding</b> Forest” (Shiraiwa 2012). As described, over the past 30 – 50  years, polynya ice production and accordingly DSW production have declined in the Sea of Okhotsk, thereby weakening the overturning at the North Pacific. Thus, the following scenario might be possible: Decline of sea ice and DSW production due to the global warming decreases the iron supply in the North Pacific {{as well as in the}} Sea of Okhotsk, thereby reducing levels of biological productivity and fishery resources.|$|E
