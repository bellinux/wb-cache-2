This piece marries an everyday environment (bathroom) with extraordinary materials (ice cubes/ dress bleeding red into water) creating the surreal. Sontag’s understanding of camp as a love of the unnatural, artifice and exaggeration, can be cited in relation to my work, as can such practitioners as Kira O’Reilly and Mario Ybarra Jr. <b>Hot</b> <b>Soak</b> explored the performer/ audience boundary in terms of actual physical exchange between two people in a one-to-one performance. Limits of acceptability and discomfort are an ongoing research concern of mine {{especially in terms of}} issues of sexuality, cultural difference, spirituality, and thereby where moments of connection/ transgression occur. I was also exploring how audiences co-create a work. By melting the ice cube into my mouth the audience made the work with me. The sweat from their chilled palm becomes {{as much a part of}} the fluid exchange as the ice itself. Both versions of <b>Hot</b> <b>Soak</b> enhanced my understanding of the audience’s response to intimate exchange in performance. Also, the site influenced the sense of ‘prostitution’; amplified by the anonymity of entering an aging seaside hotel room with one’s own key, as opposed to being led into a middle class domestic bathroom. The result of each interaction with a participant was a visual and visceral conversation exploring, for example, sexuality (such as, for a heterosexual woman the erotic fluid sharing with another woman), nurturing (for one woman equated the exchange with feeding me) and power (one man straddled the bath) - all dependent on their and my learned cultural and gender positioning...|$|E

40|$|CD-ROM included; A thesis {{submitted}} to the Department of Chemical and Process Engineering for the MSc in Chemical and Process EngineeringParboiling is a widely used paddy processing method where paddy is soaked in water to hydrate before the subsequent steaming, drying and milling operations. A significant amount of water is used in this soaking operation which is then discharged as wastewater. The continuous discharge of this wastewater has become an environmental concern in the paddy parboiling industry in Sri Lanka. In this study important characteristics of the effluent generated from two existing paddy soaking operations practiced in Sri Lanka namely <b>hot</b> <b>soaking</b> and cold soaking were initially determined. This analysis was done for wastewater resulting from soaking two rice varieties available locally, namely LD 356 a red rice and BG 300 which is a white rice. Characterization study showed pollutant levels higher in paddy soak wastewater than the stipulated local discharge standards (Appendix C). Wastewater generated from both <b>hot</b> <b>soaking</b> and cold soaking of red rice variety showed relatively higher COD and BOD values compared to those of wastewater from white rice variety. <b>Hot</b> <b>soaking</b> wastewater had higher COD and BOD values than cold soaking wastewater. The wastewater generated from <b>hot</b> <b>soaking</b> of red rice which showed higher pollutant strength is further studied for pollutant removalmethods. Biological treatment methods such as aerobic, anaerobic and physical treatment methods such as coagulation and adsorption were investigated. Removal of pollutants by aquatic plants and biological treatment using various microbial seeding sources such as cow dung, rice straw, pond water and paddy field soil were also studied. Results show that microbial sources from pond water and paddy field soil were able to reduce COD in soak wastewater by 96 % and 94 % respectively at pH 8 under aerobic and dark conditions. Combined treatment of anaerobic digestion and coagulation was able to reduce 94 % COD while the combination of adsorption and coagulation reduced COD by 92 %.

40|$|Currently, the {{emission}} inventory of vehicular {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) {{is one of those}} with the largest errors and uncertainties due to suboptimal estimation methods and the lack of first-hand basic data. In this study, an updated speciated emission inventory of VOCs and an estimation of intermediate-volatility organic compounds (IVOCs) from vehicles in China at the provincial level for the year of 2015 are developed based on a set of state-of-the-art methods and an abundance of local measurement data. Activity data for light-duty vehicles are derived from trajectories of more than 70   000 cars for 1  year. The annual mileage of trucks are calculated from reported data by more than 2  million trucks in China. The emission profiles are updated using measurement data.

40|$|Two {{important}} issues for liquid LPG or propane PFI engines were shed unacceptable HC emissions during cold starts and long hot start times. The poor cold start performance {{was linked to}} deposits forming within the fuel injectors and the long hot start times were due to the vapourization of the fuel within the fuel rail during <b>hot</b> <b>soak</b> and hot start. Solutions for both of these problems were developed. To {{determine the effects of}} fuel composition on the formation of deposits, 5 sets of fuel injectors were mileage-accumulated on road for 6400 km with 40 hot soaks using identical vehicles operating with fuels of different compositions or different injector designs. Each set of mileage-accumulated injectors was installed in a test vehicle and standard FTP emission tests were performed on a vehicle chassis dynamometer using a standard fuel.

Modeled results show that emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO) more than double during the air conditioning part of the SFTP. Reducing the transmittance of the glazing can have {{a greater impact on}} the cabin soak temperature than ventilating the vehicle during a <b>hot</b> <b>soak.</b> Reducing the amount of outside air can decrease cooling and heating loads but requires that the recirculated air be cleaned. We discuss a photocatalytic oxidation air-cleaning process for removing volatile organic compounds and bioareosols. We conclude with an example of modeling the thermal comfort of the occupants. An auxiliary load increase of only 400 Watts (W) results in a 0. 4 km/L (1 mpg) decrease for a conventional 11. 9 -L/ 100 -km (28 -mpg) vehicle.

40|$|Rice is {{the most}} popular food in Sri Lanka where {{approximately}} 70 % of the paddy production goes through the parboiling process. Parboiling process is a hydrothermal treatment method. This treatment process consumes energy, water and other environmental resources and adds air and solid emissions, effluents and wastages back to environment which cause adverse environmental impacts. Total environmental input and output emissions of the parboiling process depend on the selected treatment method and the type of equipment used. Therefore the total environmental effects of each and every step in the life cycle of the production process needs to be considered in order to identify the most environmental friendly paddy parboiling method. The overall objective of this work is to assess environmental impacts of different parboiled paddy production methods adopted in Sri Lanka by using life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. LCA is a methodological context to estimate the environmental effects caused by the life cycle of a product, service or process. Goal and scope definition, life cycle inventory analysis, life cycle impact assessment and interpretation are the four major steps in LCA methodology. The environmental performance of three parboiling methods named as modern method with <b>hot</b> <b>soaking</b> and mechanical drying, modern method with <b>hot</b> <b>soaking</b> and sun drying and semi modern method with cold soaking and sun drying were assessed and compared quantitatively and qualitatively. Processes from paddy harvesting to rice cooking are included in the system boundary. According to the results, highest impact of parboiled rice production is given by the cooking step. The highest impacts from cold soaking operation method were observed in eutrophication, depletion of abiotic resources and climate change impact categories.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{specialized}} diesel fuel injectors is growing with increased efficiency and emissions regulation. These specialized fuel injectors have nozzle diameters of 150 - 200 [mu]m which {{are susceptible to}} clogging from deposit formation. This thesis studies the deposit formation mechanisms with a thin fuel film reactor, and examines the potential {{for use of the}} reactor as a detergent screening tool. Through experimentation with the thin fuel film reactor it was found that temperature had negligible effect on the weight of a fully dried fuel film. This suggests that testing could be conducted at high or low temperatures to decrease the cycle time or increase test resolution respectively. It was also determined that dry deposits remain soluble in hot fuel immediately following drying, but become insoluble after long <b>hot</b> <b>soak</b> periods. A simple deposit formation model was constructed based on hypothesized formation factors. Although very simplified, the model matched the experimental results well. The correlation suggest that the hypothesized formation factors are critical to the formation process. The model should be expanded to explain deposit formation more generally, and further research should be conducted to better validate the model. by Orian Welling. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|The large (26 -fold {{over the}} past 25 years) {{increase}} in the on-road vehicle fleet in China has raised sustainability concerns regarding air pollution prevention, energy conservation, and climate change mitigation. China has established integrated emission control policies and measures since the 1990 s, including implementation of emission standards for new vehicles, inspection and maintenance programs for in-use vehicles, improvement in fuel quality, promotion of sustainable transportation and alternative fuel vehicles, and traffic management programs. As a result, emissions of major air pollutants from on-road vehicles in China have peaked and are now declining despite increasing vehicle population. As might be expected, progress in addressing vehicle emissions {{has not always been}} smooth and challenges such as the lack of low sulfur fuels, frauds over production conformity and in-use inspection tests, and unreliable retrofit programs have been encountered. Considering the high emission density from vehicles in East China, enhanced vehicle, fuel and transportation strategies will be required to address vehicle emissions in China. We project the total vehicle population in China to reach 400 - 500 million by 2030. Serious air pollution problems in many cities of China, in particular high ambient PM 2. 5 concentration, have led to pressure to accelerate the progress on vehicle emission reduction. A notable example is the draft China 6 emission standard released in May 2016, which contains more stringent emission limits than those in the Euro 6 regulations, and adds a real world emission testing protocol and a 48 -h evaporation testing procedure including diurnal and <b>hot</b> <b>soak</b> emissions. A scenario (PC[1]) considered in this study suggests that increasingly stringent standards for vehicle emissions could mitigate total vehicle emissions of HC, CO, NO X and PM 2. 5 in 2030 by approximately 39...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{determine}} the state of technology of pollutant emissions from 50 types of motorcycles, and {{on the basis of the}} measurements carried out to estimate the potential for reducing emissions with a view to future limit values. The vehicles tested were distributed between the various categories of vehicle on the basis of the figures for new registrations in the years 1996, 1997 and the first half of 1998 supplied by the Federal Motor Vehicle Office. The vehicle types were selected on the basis amongst other things of the statistics ('league table') of the Industrieverband Motorrad Deutschland e. V (IVM). For the categories light motorcycles and motorcycles the programme of investigation included gaseous emission measurements as per ECE Regulation 40 and the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) for passenger cars. Mopeds were tested in accordance with ECE Regulation 47 and at full power. Motorcycles with lambda-regulated catalytic converters were in addition subjected to gaseous emission testing carried out by analogy with the test regulations applying to passenger cars with lambda-regulated catalytic converters. For 10 selected vehicles, evaporative emissions were determined by the SHED test (1 -hour <b>hot</b> <b>soak</b> test and 24 -hour tank breathing test). In one exemplary calculation, a motorcycle was found to have four-and-a-half times the fuel consumption (in relation to its engine size and tare weight) of a small car. Evaporative emissions can be reduced by at least 76 % by the introduction of a limit value of 2 g HC. The introduction of gaseous emission testing for motorcycles would ensure that the CO limit at idling speed applied in the type-approval test would also be maintained in service. Where limit values are exceeded, adjustments to the engine are successful in 97 % of cases. (orig.)

40|$|AbstractRice {{cultivation}} nowadays {{has become}} as major concern to Sri Lanka due to high dependency of chemical fertilizers. There is an interest to promote utilization of rice obtained from traditional rice varieties which are well adopted to Sri Lankan environmental conditions, such varieties are highly nutritious and less dependent on agrochemicals. Thus they are ideal candidates in promoting organic food products without chemical inputs. Rice flour is a good substitute for imported wheat flour in bakery industry. However {{due to lack of}} gluten protein, rice flour cannot be used directly in bakery products without any modifications. In this study rice grains derived from four traditional rice varieties namely Madathuwalu, Kaluhenati, Pachaperumal and Ratdal were subjected to freezing at - 20 oC (24 hours and 48 hours), <b>hot</b> water <b>soaking</b> at 80 oC (5 minutes and 10 minutes) individually and in dual combinations. Untreated rice flour served as the control and experiments were conducted in triplicates. Water Absorption Index (WAI), Water Solubility (WS), Swelling Power (SP) and pH values were measured in both treated and untreated rice flour. Results showed that these physical treatments to the rice grains brings about a significant difference (p< 0. 05) on the functional properties of rice flour both individual and in dual combinations. Strong correlation (p= 0. 000) was obtained between WAI and SP. Dual modification treatments were found to be highly effective in improving functional properties of all selected traditional rice varieties compared to the single modification. Freezing at - 20 oC for 48 hours was more effective than the 24 hours freezing to improve the functional properties. Therefore, this study proves that simple physical treatment methods such as freezing and <b>hot</b> water <b>soaking</b> could bring about a significant effect on the functional properties of traditional rice flour...|$|R

40|$|The {{generative}} propagation of Mucuna bracteata {{is very difficult}} and requires special treatment. Dormancy breaking in hard seed of Mucuna purpose to enhance germination. The research wasconducted at the public land, Tanjung Selamat, Deli Serdang from November 2012 to February 2013, using a randomized block design with 2 factors and 3 replications. The first factor was thedormancy breaking (control, cutting the seed coat, polished with sand paper, and <b>hot</b> water <b>soaking)</b> and the second factor was gibberellin (GA 3) (0, 150, 300 and 450 ppm). The parameters observedwere the germination, long tendrils, number of leaves, shoot dry weight, root dry weight. The resultshowed that the dormancy breaking significantly affected to all parameters. Giving of Gibberellins(GA 3) significantly affected to the germination and shoot dry weight. Interaction between dormancybreaking and Gibberellins significantly affected to the germination and shoot dry weight. The bestgermination were showed by cutting the seed coat and giving 300 ppm GA 3...|$|R

50|$|Approximate healing {{time for}} most lip piercings is between 1 and 3 months; however, {{there is a}} {{possibility}} of serious infection if the piercing is not properly taken care of. After healing is complete, other jewelry may be used. After this time, some scar tissue may be present, but the fistula is normally fully developed and mostly healed. Aftercare consists of <b>hot</b> saline <b>soaks</b> two to three times daily. Soaking the wound for three to five minutes with a weak saline solution softens any blood and lymph discharge attached to the jewelry. Afterwards, taking a hot shower and using clean hands and a small amount of a mild soap such as castile soap removes excess matter from the site. Turning or otherwise moving jewelry on a fresh piercing is not advised, as it can irritate and lengthen swelling and healing time. Diluted mouthwash or salt water solution can also be used after meals along with toothbrushing to help remove debris and flush the piercing and is recommended by practitioners.|$|R
40|$|The {{waste of}} oil palm trunk {{could be used}} as {{alternative}} raw material for particleboard. The purpose of these studies were to evaluate durability of particleboard on termites attack. Particle pretreatment were done by <b>hot</b> water <b>soaking</b> (1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours) and cold water soaking (24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours). Particle board were made from waste of oil pulm trunk using urea formaldehida of 10 % with size 30 cm x 30 cm x 1 cm, density target 0. 75 g/cm 3, pressure 25 kg/cm 2 at 130 ºC of temperature for 10 minutes. Particleboard was tested for durability of particleboard on termites attack by grave yard test along 100 days and wil be compared by SNI 01 - 7207 - 2006. The percentages of particleboard weight loss were 41. 05 - 60. 29 %. Based on the termites attack rate, all of particleboards were classified as very bad durability. The best of particleboards durability was the board with cold water soaking for 72 hours treatment with 41. 05 % of particleboard weight loss...|$|R
5000|$|In 1882, Thomas Cooper and {{his wife}} homesteaded the area {{on the east side}} of town where hot springs water emerged. They built a wood box to collect the water and offered it as a soaking pool. Later, around 1905, a {{building}} was erected. There was a dance floor, an indoor swimming pool, and many dressing rooms. Many people came from miles around by horse and buggy to enjoy soaking and dancing. In 1930 Farnsworth bought the hot springs. He was the leader of a band, and it became the house band. The slogan for the Monroe hot springs was, [...] "the home of mirth and merriment". The hot springs enjoyed many years of prosperity until around 1950. It was revitalized in the 1970s. The name was changed to Mystic Hot Springs in 1995. Mike Ginsburg has been operating the facility since 1996. There are two <b>hot</b> springs <b>soaking</b> pools and 6 big bath tubs filled with the hot springs water. They host music concerts regularly and have a Music Festival around the July 24th holiday.|$|R
