500|$|The Popular Science Review {{began by}} writing that [...] "We never {{remember}} {{to have taken}} up a book which gave us more pleasure". It was quite unlike the dull <b>journey</b> <b>logs</b> of most travel books; it was [...] "a romance, which is, nevertheless, plain matter of fact". The review especially admires the way that Wallace [...] "has generalised on the facts" [...] rather than just shooting [...] "a multitude of birds" [...] and interminably describing them. The account notes that Wallace was the joint originator {{of the theory of}} natural selection, and summarises the discovery of the Wallace line in some detail. The review ends by placing the Malay Archipelago between Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology and Darwin's Origin of Species.|$|R

40|$|The {{benefits}} of {{regular physical activity}} for older adults are now well-established but this group remain the least active sector of the population. In this paper, the association between levels of neighbourhood deprivation and physical activity was assessed. A sample of 125 males {{with a mean age}} of 77. 5 (+/- 5. 6) years, and 115 females {{with a mean age of}} age 78. 6 (+/- 8. 6) underwent 7 -day accelerometry, a physical performance battery, and completed a daily <b>journeys</b> <b>log.</b> Univariate associations between physical activity parameters and level of deprivation of neighbourhood were extinguished in regression models controlling for age, gender, and level of educational attainment. Age, gender, educational attainment, body mass index, physical function, and frequency of journeys from the home explained between 50 % and 54 % of variance in activity parameters. These results suggest the importance of strategies to help older adults maintain physical function, healthy weight, and remain active in their communities...|$|R

The Bird Artist and The Northern Lights were finalists for the National Book Award. The Northern Lights was completed with assistance from the Whiting Award. He received the Harold Morton Landon Translation Award from the Academy of American Poets for The Wishing Bone Cycle. In On the trail of a ghost, an article published by National Geographic, Norman writes about Japan’s haiku master, Matsuo Bashō's 1200-mile walk in 1689, and the <b>journey's</b> epic <b>log,</b> entitled Oku no Hosomichi.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the content of}} an album of P. Lejeune and C. Bogaert, published in Paris in last year (in 2003), dedicated to a personal diary. The fact of bringing out of this publication became for {{the author of this}} article an impulse to present an anthropological view at the form of diary. The author - taking an opportunity of presenting the content of the album - gives an outline of the tradition of the genre, discusses various criteria (geographical, historical, sociological) which have an influence on the development and formation of this literary form. The author also draws attention to the significant features of a personal diary (the ones which differ it from, e. g. autobiography) and its kinds (from the purest form of a personal, intimate diary through the diary-letter written by one to him/herself to some unconvetional diaries such as: a painter's diary, diary-comic-strip, film diary, diary-photograph, on line diary - blog). While also pointing to such forms as: spiritual diaries, <b>journey</b> diaries, <b>log</b> books, and historical chronicles, the author emphasises the necessity of relating the origin of the diary with a concrete situation of men...|$|R

His last known communication was a letter mailed to his girlfriend, Charlotte, while hiding in Bario. In the letter, Manser said he was very tired while waiting for the sun to set before continuing his <b>journey</b> along the <b>logging</b> roads. The letter was deposited at the Bario post office and reached Switzerland with a Malaysian stamp but without a post office stamp. Manser was last seen carrying a 30-kilogram backpack by his Penan friend, Paleu and Paleu's son on 25 May 2000. They accompanied Manser until they saw Bukit Batu Lawi (2000-metre limestone pinnacle in Sarawak). Manser stated his intention to climb the mountain alone and requested Paleu to leave him there. Manser has not been seen since.|$|R

When informed where Jonas was from, Talbot told him he wouldn't sell him any land. Not {{ready to give up}} yet, Jonas replied he would go over Talbot's head. He waited and returned several days later to try again and was awarded with a parcel of land at the princely sum of $2:00 an acre on the shores of Lake Erie, 2 mi west of Port Tyrconnell. Jonas was able to clear the land and build a log house {{with the help of his}} nearest neighbour, a Mr. Job Curtis. This was an extremely important as Talbot had been known to repossess the land of settlers who did not clear and settler the land within an acceptable time period.

40|$|Deeply patriotic, dedicated, and self-educated, Zhuang Xueben (1909 - 1984) typified his {{generation}} in many respects. He {{set out on}} a self-imposed mission to investigate the underexplored territory between Republican China and Central Tibet in 1934. His writings about his adventures and observations became popular in his native Shanghai and in other urban areas of China, where investigating and categorizing the borderlands were part of broader, nation-building methods during the Republican period. However, what set Zhuang apart from his contemporaries were the extraordinary photographs he took of his <b>journey</b> throughout Mgo <b>log</b> and surrounding areas in 1934. Images of vast landscapes featuring craggy gorges and bucolic villages inhabited by various ethnicities including the Qiang and the Rong were published in the major photographic periodicals of the day, and led to an increased interest in his work and new patronage opportunities from the Republican government that allowed Zhuang to continue his journeys. These extended into Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan, Yunnan, and the short-lived experimental province of Xikang, as well as briefly into India. Between 1934 {{and the end of the}} 1950 s, Zhuang took over 3, 000 photographs of the people he met during his travels, and took thousands of pages of notes. He was an excellent example of the young, adventurous Chinese intellectuals of Reviews 472 his day who believed that they could contribute to the stabilization of the Chinese nation by creating studies of its different cultures and peoples.

2500|$|Auctioneer's description: Fine and {{extensive}} journal of Sir Henry Martin of Harley Street, London, chronicling {{his visit to}} the West Indies between 1836 and 1837, a detailed manuscript journal, closely written on 271 pages, with one pencil sketch showing a group of carts crossing a bridge, bound in marbled boards, 8vo A highly important account by a high status visitor to the West Indies at a very early date. Martin appears to be a very meticulous individual, with an eye for minute detail throughout his journey in every degree, making this an invaluable record not only of the West Indies, but also the general conditions in every place he visited, including the U.K. For example, he leaves Piccadilly in December 1836 via the Herald Coach to Falmouth noting, [...] "Passage money inside £4:5:0, outside £2:5:0 - I had three enquiries made at the coach office on different days to ascertain the exact time that the coach got into Falmouth for the purpose of ordering dinner or not ...". He then notes in great detail the time taken to reach Falmouth. He leaves Piccadilly at 9.47am, reaching Bagshot at 53 minutes past noon, for example. He and his family (with servant) leave Falmouth on board the Mutine, the passage for all costing £38. On board are a group of Cornish miners going to Cuba on a mining scheme. During the <b>journey,</b> he <b>logs</b> latitudes and longitudes for the entire passage, and details the day to day happenings on the vessel. The family reach the West Indies the following February and the journal is equally detailed about the topography and general social conditions which Martin observes. For example, he says of Martinique, [...] "There are here many excellent shops, which would not disgrace Paris, and many private houses three storeys high and from four to six windows in line, chiefly I think built of stone ... we went to a hotel (as it's called) kept by a mulatto woman called Parker, a native of Barbados and well known to all naval persons who have been here of late years - I think she must be nearly 60 but she looks very much younger. She is quite a character and a very shrewd one too ...". This is an invaluable insight into the early 19th century, which deserves considerable research.|$|R
