5|$|After {{paralleling}} {{the reservoir}} <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>two</b> miles (3km), a third route, US6, joins the concurrency {{just east of}} the village of Brewster. The three routes cross under a high, long bridge carrying I-84, then veer east to an interchange with the north end of I-684. US6 and 202 continue east for Danbury while NY22 uses the northbound on-ramp of the I-684 roadway. The short expressway connector that carries northbound I-684 traffic to northbound NY22 is NY981B, an unsigned reference route.|$|E

5|$|<b>For</b> <b>almost</b> <b>two</b> {{decades after}} its discovery, Psilocybe tampanensis was known {{only from the}} type locality, {{southeast}} of Brandon, Florida. In 1996, Guzmán reported finding it in a meadow with sandy soil in a deciduous forest in Pearl River County, Mississippi, a habitat {{similar to that of}} the type location. Due to its scarcity, however, its habitat preferences are not known with certainty. Like all Psilocybe species, it is saprobic.|$|E

5|$|The 1974–75 Yugoslav Cup edition was not held, {{due to the}} {{rescheduling}} purposes as the Football Association of Yugoslavia {{had decided}} to move the date of cup final from 29 November (or Republic Day, {{the anniversary of the}} establishment of communist Yugoslavia) to on or around 25 May (or Youth Day, a national holiday which doubled as the official celebration of Josip Broz Tito's birthday).

5|$|The K'iche' conquest {{appears to}} have taken place around AD1000, some four centuries earlier than had been {{supposed}} using calculations based on the indigenous accounts. After the initial arrival of the K'iche' activity continued at the site without pause, and the local styles were simply replaced by styles associated with the conquerors. This suggests that the original inhabitants abandoned the city they had occupied <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>two</b> millennia.|$|E
5|$|The {{frequency}} of crises and {{the severity of}} the 1907 panic added to concern about the outsized role of J.P. Morgan which led to renewed impetus toward a national debate on reform. In May 1908, Congress passed the Aldrich–Vreeland Act that established the National Monetary Commission to investigate the panic and to propose legislation to regulate banking. Senator Nelson Aldrich (R–RI), the chairman of the National Monetary Commission, went to Europe <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>two</b> years to study that continent's banking systems.|$|E

5|$|By 829, {{when the}} young emperor Theophilos ascended the Byzantine throne, the Byzantines and Arabs had been {{fighting}} on and off <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>two</b> centuries. At this time, Arab attacks resumed both in the east, where after almost twenty years of peace due to the Abbasid civil war Caliph al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833) launched several large-scale raids, and in the west, where the gradual Muslim conquest of Sicily was under way since 827. Theophilos was an ambitious man and also a convinced adherent of Byzantine Iconoclasm, which prohibited the depiction of divine figures and the veneration of icons. He sought to bolster his regime and support his religious policies by military success against the Abbasid Caliphate, the Empire's major antagonist.|$|E
5|$|Each evening, Texas {{retired from}} her {{bombardment}} position close to Okinawa, but returned {{the next morning}} to resume her bombardments. The enemy ashore, preparing for a defense-in-depth strategy as at Iwo Jima, made no answer. Only air units provided a response, as several kamikaze raids were sent to harass the bombardment group. Texas escaped damage during those attacks. On 1 April, after six days of aerial and naval bombardment, the ground troops went ashore, and <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>two</b> months, Texas remained in Okinawan waters providing gunfire support for the troops and fending off the enemy aerial assault. In performing the latter mission, she claimed one kamikaze kill on her own and claimed three assists. On 14 May she departed Okinawa for the Philippines.|$|E
5|$|Freshmen were {{expected}} to build the early Bonfires to help prove their worth. <b>For</b> <b>almost</b> <b>two</b> decades, the students constructed Bonfire from debris and wood acquired through various, sometimes illicit, means, including appropriating lumber intended for a dormitory in 1912. In 1935, a farmer reported that students carried off his entire barn as fuel for Bonfire. To prevent future incidents, the university made Bonfire a school-sanctioned event. The following year, for the first time, the school provided axes, saws, and trucks for the students and pointed them toward a grove of dead trees {{on the edge of}} town.|$|E

5|$|In 1923, Famous Players-Lasky {{president}} Jesse Lasky {{was looking}} for a new Production Editor in the story department of his studio and Thalberg suggested Hawks.

Hawks worked on the scripts for all of the films produced, but he had his first official screenplay credit in 1924 on Tiger Love. Hawks was the Story Editor at Famous Players (later Paramount Pictures) <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>two</b> years, occasionally editing such films as Heritage of the Desert.|$|E
5|$|It {{continues}} {{along the}} hillside of Black Mountain, Washington County's highest peak, as it meanders {{north on the}} narrowing isthmus between Lakes Champlain and George.

The highway skirts the northeastern edge of the village, the site of key battles in both the French and Indian and Revolutionary Wars, as NY74 comes in from the ferry to the east. This overlap lasts <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>two</b> miles (3km) until NY74 goes straight ahead at the intersection with NY9N, while NY22 turns right to join NY9N, the longest suffixed route in the state, and return to its northbound orientation.|$|E
5|$|Luoyang, {{the region}} of his birthplace, was {{recovered}} by government forces {{in the winter of}} 762, and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze, apparently with the intention of making their way there. They traveled slowly, held up by his ill-health (by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments). They stayed in Kuizhou (in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing) {{at the entrance to the}} Three Gorges <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>two</b> years from late spring 766. This period was Du Fu's last great poetic flowering, and here he wrote 400 poems in his dense, late style.|$|E

40|$|On {{the basis}} {{and with the}} {{inclusion}} of results described in a previous paper [2], submitted <b>for</b> publication <b>almost</b> <b>two</b> years ago, we add some comments on very recent developments regarding both the design and synthesis of thermotropic nematogens of low-molecular weight, supposed biaxial in character, as well as puzzles, still unsolved, with methods of their unambiguous identification. In general, this update may demonstrate the complexity and problematic nature inherent in this topical subject of research indicated by a struggle over a very relevant, but very difficult matter...|$|R
5|$|Matthias {{made his}} state entry into Buda five days later. He ceremoniously {{sat on the}} throne in the Church of Our Lady, but was not crowned, because the Holy Crown of Hungary {{had been in the}} {{possession}} of Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>two</b> decades. The 14-year-old monarch administered state affairs independently from the outset, although he reaffirmed his uncle's position as Regent.

Đurišić attended a teacher training college in Berane <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>two</b> years.|$|E
5|$|Potemkin's {{first task}} {{during this period}} was foreign policy. An anglophile, he helped {{negotiate}} with the English ambassador, Sir James Harris, during Catherine's initiative of Armed Neutrality, though the south remained his passion. His plan, known as the Greek Project, aspired {{to build a new}} Byzantine Empire around the Turkish capital in Constantinople. Dismembering the Ottoman Empire would require détente with Austria (technically still the Habsburg Monarchy), and its ruler Joseph II. They met in May 1780 in the Russian town of Mogilev. The ensuing alliance represented the triumph of Potemkin's approach over courtiers such as Catherine's son Paul, who favored alliance with Prussia. The May 1781 defensive treaty remained secret <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>two</b> years; the Ottomans were said to still have been unaware of it even when they declared war on Russia in 1787.|$|E
50|$|With the Great Depression, the Illinois Traction System staggered. The ITS relinquished {{many of its}} city {{streetcar}} {{lines in}} the 1930s, and due to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 it was forced to cut its ties with an affiliated firm that provided electrical utility services. The passenger railroad reorganized in 1937 as the Illinois Terminal Railroad (ITR) and continued to provide electric-powered interurban, long-distance multiple car passenger train service Peoria/Danville to St. Louis <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> another <b>two</b> decades. United States postal contracts helped provide revenue to make this service viable.|$|R

Weisner announced his candidacy <b>for</b> mayor <b>almost</b> <b>two</b> years before the election, in order to solidify his base of support, which might have gone to other potential candidates if he waited. Eventually, a final field of five contested for the two spots on the ballot for the April 5, 2005 general election, but Weisner had endorsements from eight of the twelve city council members and a huge funding advantage.|$|R
