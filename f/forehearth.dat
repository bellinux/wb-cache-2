The batch house handles the raw materials; the hot end handles the manufacture proper — the <b>forehearth,</b> annealing ovens, and forming machines; and the cold end handles the product-inspection and [...] -packaging equipment.|$|E
50|$|A central {{power plant}} was {{installed}} with three separate Dowson pressure gas plants powered by three tandem type Kynoch gas engines of 320 hp and two duplex type Hornsby gas engines of 200 hp. Two Swedish General Electric Company generators of 1,250 kW and 56 kW running at 460 volts, supplied electricity to the {{machines in the}} works, fitting shops and mine pumps. Electric light for the mine and works was supplied by a British Thompson-Houston generator of 42 kW, running at 420 volts. The fuel used in the gas producers was bituminous coal, coke or charcoal, made locally in the retorts.The reduction plant consisted of two water-jacket furnaces, 2.1m by 1m and 4.2m by 1m, with dust chambers and a 52m high steel stack. There were two electrically driven converter vessels, each 3.2m by 2.3m. The molten product ran into a 3.7m diameter <b>forehearth,</b> while the slag was drawn off into double ton slag pots, run to the dump over 3 foot gauge, 42 lb steel rail tracks. The copper was delivered from the <b>forehearth</b> to the converters. A 1.06m gauge track ran under the converters and carried the copper mould cars to the cleaning and shipping shed, {{at the end of}} which was the siding for railing out the cakes of blister copper.|$|E
50|$|This book {{describes}} smelting, which Agricola {{describes as}} perfecting the metal by fire. The design of furnaces is first explained.These {{are very similar}} for smelting different metals, constructed of brick or soft stone with a brick front and mechanically driven bellows at the rear. At the front is a pit called the fore-hearth to receive the metal. The furnace is charged with beneficiated ore and crushed charcoal and lit. In some gold and silver smelting a lot of slag is produced because of the relative poverty of the ore and the tap hole has to be opened at various times to remove different slag materials. When the furnace is ready, the <b>forehearth</b> is filled with molten lead into which the furnace is tapped. In other furnaces the smelting can be continuous, and lead is placed into the furnace if there is none in the ore. The slag is skimmed {{off the top of}} the metal as it is tapped. The lead containing the gold is separated by cupellation, the metal rich slags are re-smelted. Other smelting processes are similar, but lead is not added. Agricola also describes making crucible steel and distilling mercury and bismuth in this book.|$|E
50|$|Heavy {{rain on the}} Etheridge {{watershed}} {{washed away}} the Tate and Lynd River railway bridges and the Chillagoe smelters had to close between 19 April and 3 May 1911. Copper smelting only operated for half the year. The copper furnace was remodelled in May 1911 with extra battery jackets replacing the brick shaft. The <b>forehearths</b> of cast iron were also replaced by riveted mild steel. The tanks were lined with chrome bricks. A 42 inch Dwight-Lloyd unit for the palate sintering process was completed by November 1911. However {{a large part of}} the smelter, including an electric crane, was destroyed by fire. The damage was quickly repaired and the smelter recommenced in February 1912.|$|R
40|$|A <b>forehearth</b> is {{a shallow}} channel {{connecting}} the glass melting furnace to the gob dispenser {{in the glass}} bottles production process. Although {{the temperature of the}} molten glass has to decrease by several hundred degrees in the <b>forehearth,</b> the temperature distribution in the outlet section must be uniform. Due to the extremely convoluted character of the flow pattern, it is difficult to suggest the design rules and operational procedures that will ensure this uniformity without resorting to detailed experimental and numerical studies. Using a room temperature physical model, we have simulated the creeping flow of glass in a <b>forehearth.</b> The 3 D temperature field and velocity field of the model fluid (silicon oil) were mapped. In particular, the complexity of the flow pattern immediately upstream of the outlet section was revealed, and more generally, the overriding importance of the gravity currents induced by the non uniformity of the temperature (hence density) field came to the fore. Numerical results obtained using a commercial computer code (Fluent) were compared to experimental data; they were used to gain insight {{in the structure of the}} non isothermal creeping flow considered here. Finally, three modifications of the channel design, meant to improve the temperature uniformity near the outlet section, were tested experimentally.

40|$|In {{an earlier}} work, we had {{proposed}} a two-band, non-grey radiative transfer model for heat transfer in forehearths with simultaneous optically {{thick and thin}} approximations for molten glass interiors and at boundaries. Here using the same model, the radiative interaction of the top-crown and bottom-refractory walls with interior layers of shallow molten glass is studied by varying the wall emissivities. The <b>forehearth</b> exit temperature profiles for higher wall emissivities (0. 9) show better conditioning of the glass for white flint glasses (optically thin) ...|$|E
40|$|An attempt of {{rationalization}} of {{the cast}} iron melting process proceeding in a cupola has been taken on, based on the working parameters recorded during the first several hours of the cupola work. Examinations have been centred around the melting process taking place in a Ø 700 hot-blast cupola with a fixed receiver (<b>forehearth).</b> It {{has been found that}} a significant reduction in coke consumption is possible due to changes in cupola burdening without a detriment to furnace efficiency or the temperature of molten cast iron...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the eighties}} of the 20 th century {{supervisory}} control {{systems have been}} used in the glass industry. Model Predictive Control (MPC) technology, which was developed in the chemical industry, was introduced in the glass industry for control of forehearths and crown temperatures in glass melting tanks. The mathematical (black box) models used in these controllers were determined from process data. To this end tests were performed on the process so that the time dependent behavior of the process could be observed and the model parameters could be estimated. In the last ten years application of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models has become possible through model reduction. Via Proper Orthogonal Decomposition the relevant flow and temperature characteristics in the glass melt can be found for the normal operating range of the process. Depending on the operating range linear or nonlinear reduced models can be chosen to make fast predictions of the process behavior. This paper presents some recent results of industrial applications of MPC based on reduced CFD models, called the RMPC approach. Results will be shown for a container glass <b>forehearth.</b> The <b>forehearth</b> controller was designed for two glass colors and two models were needed to cover the working range. In both applications the variation of the relevant temperatures was reduced by 50 % or more...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The thesis describes the design and construction of a local area computer network to provide a distributed industrial control and monitoring system for glass container manufacture. In particular, a commercially available local area network, originally manufactured to link industrial programmable controllers, {{has been used to}} allow the implementation of multi-processor control scheme for container forming and to achieve an integrated data processing link with other plant computers concerned with inspection and quality data collection. A microprocessor-based I. S. machine controller was designed to replace conventional Timing Drum controllers used in many container manufacturing plants, and linked to the local area network. The control system developed provided the usual machine sequencing functions but also provided adaptive control of the invert mechanism speed using a specially designed electropneumatic servo mechanism valve. A data capture system was also designed, developed and tested to allow' on-line monitoring of container inspection machines. The system utilises the local area network to provide access to a file server (for data storage), to allow remote access (e. g. in Quality Control) and to establish a link with the I. S. machine controllers. The distributed control and monitoring scheme produced allows the convenient integration of other data processing functions in other plant areas such as batch, furnace, <b>forehearth,</b> and packing and can facilitate the integration of organisational functions such as planning, scheduling, and data base management in a planned step by step manner...|$|E
40|$|The {{theme of}} the {{presented}} degree thesis is "The optimalisation of glass melting furnaces using mathematical modellng". The description of processes, which are taking place during the glass melting, is for the high temperature very difficult. Therefore we can use either physical modelling or mathematical modelling. For mathematical modelling was the CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) code Fluent and Fluent/UNS used. The thesis is divided in three parts. In the first part, the combustion space of glass melting furnace was modelled, where the temperature distribution influence on fuel input was predicted. The influence was studied {{on the model of}} the FLOAT Nashville furnace. The modelled variants are proposed to simulate the temperature maximum shifting, extension of temperature maximum range, boosting using fuel input changing to the ports. The modelling results were compared with measured data (TC 21) and with the results from other modelling laboratory (TNO). The results show very good agreement with measured data. The second part deals with melting tank modelling. This model was used to simulate the melting conditions during melting life of the furnace, where the corrosion has a very important influence on the cooling rate and on the throat-temperature. Using results from the modelling, it is possible to describe the relationship between the throat-temperature, size of the furnace and cooling rate (heat transfer through side walls). The last part deals with VELLO <b>forehearth</b> modelling where the relationships between pull rate, overflow rate, overflow location and refractories heat loss were studied. Using results from modelling was determined for the given pull rate of the optimum overflow rate, overflow location and the refractory heat lossAvailable from STL Prague, CZ / NTK - National Technical LibrarySIGLECZCzech Republi...|$|E
