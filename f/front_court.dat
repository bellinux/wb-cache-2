25|$|Gutta likes playing {{aggressive}} badminton {{and has a}} great {{affinity for}} the <b>front</b> <b>court,</b> with her skilled netplay, good anticipation {{and the ability to}} play deceptive strokes at the net. She is considered very dangerous in the <b>front</b> <b>court</b> with her good reading of the game and sharp interceptions. She also has a strong smash from the back court and often makes use of deceptive drops. Gutta is vulnerable in a few areas of her game, most evidently in her movement across the court. She can commit certain unforced errors when forced to move out of her favoured positions. She has also had some fitness issues and injury troubles in her long career. Gutta is also known for being one of the only top doubles player to still use the forehand service, since most other doubles specialists opt for the safer backhand serve. She stands unique in this aspect.|$|E

25|$|Whereas many Cambridge colleges {{celebrate}} May Week with a May Ball (which actually {{falls in}} June), {{since the early}} 1980s King's has instead held a June Event (an informal version of a May Ball with fancy dress) known as The King's Affair. This takes place annually on the Wednesday night of May Week (usually c. 20 June), and is attended by around 1,500 students, occupying the <b>Front</b> <b>Court,</b> bar, Hall and Chapel. Past performers have included The Stranglers, Fatboy Slim, Noah and the Whale and, in 2009, Clean Bandit.

25|$|Later in the season, on December 18, the Celtics {{released}} {{yet another}} player, Brandon Wallace, {{in order to}} have even more roster flexibility that coach Doc Rivers said they needed. This move brought the roster down to only 13players, which is the league minimum for players allowed on a team's roster. On February 27, the Celtics signed center P.J. Brown {{for the remainder of the}} season, in order to bolster their <b>front</b> <b>court.</b> His decision to come to Boston was strongly aided by a conversation with future teammates Ray Allen and Paul Pierce, who convinced him to sign with the Celtics during the 2008 NBA All-Star Weekend. On March 4, 2008, the Celtics officially announced that they had signed guard Sam Cassell. After the signing, Cassell immediately flew back to his hometown of Baltimore to attend funeral services for a deceased family member. This signing ultimately put the roster up to the league maximum of 15players.|$|E
25|$|After {{failing to}} defend their Philippine Cup crown, they signed Alex Crisano to {{supplement}} their <b>front</b> <b>court</b> and Rahshon Turner as their import for the 2008 PBA Fiesta Conference. Despite a different look, the Kings had a slow start losing their first five games with both Turner and Ernest Brown. To stop the losing streak, they replaced Brown with another recruit from the NBA Development League, Chris Alexander whose inside scoring and rebounding helped the Kings win 10 of their next 13 games in the eliminations. The Kings ended on a high note ending the eliminations 10–8 with an outright quarterfinals berth. They faced Sta. Lucia in the quarterfinals and completed a 2-game sweep en route to another showdown against Red Bull. In the semis, which everyone predicted to be a 7-game showdown saw the Kings sweep the Barakos that included a 101–97 overtime victory in Game 4. So convincingly was the sweep that they shamed Red Bull all throughout the series. After the last game of the series, the Barakos {{went all the way}} to their locker room without congratulating Barangay Ginebra. This gave Ginebra its first series sweep in franchise history, and its 17th finals appearance. This also gave Uichico his 12th finals appearance (second with Ginebra) and the third sweep in league history since the 1992 Third Conference when Swift swept 7-Up in the finals. The Game 4 victory extended their winning streak dating back from the eliminations to 12 (the longest in franchise history).|$|E

500|$|In the {{following}} two seasons, the aging Celtics failed to reach the Finals, becoming overshadowed {{by the rise of}} the Detroit Pistons. The Lakers would manage to defend their title in the 1988 Finals, winning the series in 7 games against the Pistons. They then became the first team to win back-to-back NBA titles since 1969. Seeking a three-peat in 1989, the Lakers were swept by the Pistons in a rematch of the previous year's Finals. In 1990, the Pistons then went back-to-back after defeating the Blazers in five games, attaining the nickname [...] "Bad Boys" [...] due to its rough, physical play. Led by a Hall of Fame back court in Joe Dumars and Isiah Thomas and a rugged <b>front</b> <b>court</b> in Dennis Rodman and Bill Laimbeer, the Pistons were attained great success.|$|E

500|$|In {{his first}} season, Olajuwon {{finished}} second to Michael Jordan in NBA Rookie of the Year balloting, and the Rockets record improved by 19 games, {{good enough for}} a return to the playoffs as the third best team in the West, where they were upset by the sixth-seeded Utah Jazz. The Olajuwon and Sampson duo earned much praise, and was nicknamed [...] "Twin Towers". In the following season, Houston won the Midwest Division title with a 51–31 record. The subsequent playoffs had the Rockets sweeping the Sacramento Kings, having a hard-fought six-game series with Alex English's Denver Nuggets, and then facing defending champion Lakers, losing the first game but eventually managing to win the series [...] – the only Western Playoffs defeat of the Showtime Lakers – to get to the franchise's second Finals appearance. The NBA Finals once again matched the Rockets up against the Celtics, a contrast to Houston's young front challenging the playoff-hardened Celtics <b>front</b> <b>court</b> of Larry Bird, Kevin McHale and Robert Parish. The Celtics won the first two games in Boston, gave the Rockets their only home playoff defeat that season in game 4, and clinched the title as Bird scored a triple-double on Game 6.|$|E
500|$|In the {{following}} season, both Olajuwon and Sampson were {{named to the}} Western Conference All-Stars in that year's all-star game, and the duo was nicknamed the [...] "Twin Towers". Houston won the Midwest Division title with a 51–31 record. In contrast to the other guard-oriented teams of the Western Conference, the Rockets had a high rotation on the position – John Lucas left the team 65 games into the season, Allen Leavell replaced him for twelve games before breaking his wrist, and Robert Reid took over as the starter from {{the final game of}} the regular season on. During the playoffs, the Rockets swept the Sacramento Kings before a hard-fought series with Alex English's Denver Nuggets, including one game going to double overtime in the exhausting altitude of the Mile-High City. The young squad grinded it out and eventually pulled away with the victory over the Nuggets 4–2. [...] When faced with defending champion Lakers in the Conference Finals, the Rockets were ready to knock off their rivals who had the best of them during the regular season. The Rockets, however, were blown out of Game 1 with Olajuwon's spinning reverse dunks and Sampson's alley-oops notwithstanding. Embarrassed by the loss, Olajuwon and the Rockets stormed back to shock the star-studded defending champions with 4 straight wins in an impressive four games to one series victory, a feat that no other Western Conference team had come close to doing against the Showtime Lakers. Sampson's buzzer beater that won Game 5 was described by him as [...] "the greatest moment of my basketball career". The Rockets competed in the finals {{for only the second time}} in team history, once again facing the Celtics. Boston sportswriters were not happy about not getting a shot at revenge against the Lakers who had beaten the Celtics in the Finals the year before, yet the matchup was interesting with the young <b>front</b> <b>court</b> challenging the playoff-hardened Celtics <b>front</b> <b>court</b> of Bird, McHale and Parish. The Celtics won the first two games at the Boston Garden, only for the Rockets to win two games once the series went back to Houston – a close game 3 under Sampson's leadership, and a 15 point-leading game 5 without him as he got ejected – while also losing game 4 due to late Larry Bird 3 pointers and untimely turnovers by Rockets guard Mitchell Wiggins. Game 6 went back to Boston with Sampson finding himself again in foul trouble and of little effect against the older and wiser Celtics. [...] After the series, Boston coach KC Jones called the Rockets, [...] "the new monsters on the block" [...] with the future looking very bright for the Rockets. During the six-game championship series loss against the Celtics, Sampson averaged 14.8 points on [...]438 shooting, 9.5 rebounds and 3.3 assists per game.|$|E

He was traded along with a conditional second round draft pick to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for Chucky Brown after playing in only nine games for Milwaukee. Hancock remained inactive on the Suns' injured list with bruised knees and was waived a week later on December 11, 1996.|$|E
2500|$|After Andrew Bynum {{was injured}} {{for the rest}} of the season, the Lakers needed help in the <b>front</b> <b>court</b> before they risked falling out of {{contention}} in the playoff race. In February, the Lakers traded Kwame Brown, Javaris Crittenton, Aaron McKie (who was re-signed specifically for the trade), the draft rights to Marc Gasol, two first-round draft picks (2008 and 2010) and cash for Pau Gasol and a second-round draft pick in 2010. Many consider the Lakers the major benefactor of the trade. As a result, some criticized the trade as being unbalanced in excessively benefiting the Lakers. Gregg Popovich called Memphis' agreement to the terms of the trade [...] "beyond comprehension" [...] and suggested that the league should form a committee to [...] "scratch all trades that make no sense". The trade became an immediate success for the Lakers, who went 22–5 with Gasol in the lineup and went on to reach the NBA Finals.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 October 2007, the Raptors {{announced}} they had exercised a third year option on Bargnani, giving a guaranteed NBA contract through the 2008–09 season and retaining a fourth year {{option for the}} 2009–10 season. Prior to the 2007–08 season, Bargnani was voted by the general managers of the league as the [...] "international player {{most likely to have}} a breakout season". Seemingly asked to play out of position, he was slated to form the <b>front</b> <b>court</b> together with All-Star power forward Chris Bosh, but despite leading the team in scoring for the first couple of games, Bargnani struggled for most {{of the first half of}} the season. Notwithstanding his poor form, the Italian was selected to play with the Sophomores in the T-Mobile Rookie Challenge during the NBA All-Star Weekend. By the season's end, however, Bargnani was widely criticised for having a poor season. [...] His statistics had gone down, he was not grabbing enough rebounds, was unable to shoot well, got into foul trouble easily and did not drive to the basket enough. He did not feature prominently in the playoffs either—in which the Raptors were eliminated by the Orlando Magic in the first round—and there were even calls for him to be traded.|$|E
