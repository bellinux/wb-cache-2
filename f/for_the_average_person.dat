This resulted in increasingly fierce competition between operators and led to a price warfare to fill planes and hotels. Under Tom Gullick's management, Shipping Industrial Holdings subsidiary Clarksons Holidays became the undisputed cut-price leader in the IT market. By 1973, Clarksons carried 1.1 million holidaymakers — almost 1968's whole industry total — and contracted over 70% of Court Line's charter capacity. Its meteoric rise was entirely volume-based. It generated the required volumes by ruthlessly undercutting rivals and outbidding them to win the race for securing accommodation in popular overseas holiday resorts, especially in Spain.

25|$|Robert M. Ball, {{a former}} {{commissioner}} of Social Security under President Kennedy in 1961 (and later under Johnson, and Nixon) defined the {{major obstacle to}} financing health insurance for the elderly: {{the high cost of}} care for the aged combined with the generally low incomes of retired people. Because retired older people use much more medical care than younger employed people, an insurance premium related to the risk for older people needed to be high, but if the high premium had to be paid after retirement, when incomes are low, it was an almost impossible burden <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>person.</b> The only feasible approach, he said, was to finance health insurance {{in the same way as}} cash benefits for retirement, by contributions paid while at work, when the payments are least burdensome, with the protection furnished in retirement without further payment. In the early 1960s relatively few of the elderly had health insurance, and what they had was usually inadequate. Insurers such as Blue Cross, which had originally applied the principle of community rating, faced competition from other commercial insurers that did not community rate, and so were forced to raise their rates for the elderly.|$|E
25|$|All {{ambulances}} are to {{be equipped}} with highly reflective green and yellow 'checkerboard' markings (the English term is 'Battenburg' pattern), of specified proportions, running {{the entire length of}} the vehicle. The intent of this measure was to provide specific 'visual identities' for emergency vehicles, by reserving this pattern for ambulances, blue and yellow Battenburg for police cars, and red and yellow Battenburg for fire service vehicles. In addition, all lettering on the vehicle is required to be highly reflective, in order to boost vehicle visibility in all conditions. The colour combination selected was chosen for specific reasons. Under night time conditions, green is among the most visible (exceeded only by blue) of colours, creating high visibility (and safety) for ambulance vehicles. Unfortunately, for many of those who suffer from colour-blindness, neither green nor red is visible, washing out to shades of grey or dark yellow. In fact, almost 99 percent of all colour vision deficiency involves some form of red-green colour blindness, and includes an estimated 7-10 percent of all males, depending on location. However, even for these individuals, the colour yellow is always visible (see diagram). The resulting pattern is both high visibility and eye-catching <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>person,</b> provides improved night time visibility for most, and provides a combination which is identifiable, at least in part, by the majority of the population.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea for}} a new [...] {{motorcycle}} was conceived in 1956, when Honda Motor's Soichiro Honda and Takeo Fujisawa toured Germany and witnessed the popularity of mopeds and lightweight motorcycles. Soichiro Honda was primarily the engineering and production leader of the company, always with an eye towards winning on the racetrack, while his close partner Fujisawa was the man of finance and business, heading up sales and formulating strategies intended to dominate markets and utterly destroy Honda Motor's competitors. Fujisawa {{had been thinking about}} a long term expansion strategy, and unlike other Japanese companies, {{they did not want to}} simply boost production to cash in on the recent economic boom in Japan. A small, high-performance motorcycle was central to his plans. Upwardly mobile consumers in postwar Europe typically went from a bicycle to a clip-on engine, then bought a scooter, then a bubble car, and then a small car and onwards. Fujisawa saw that a motorcycle did not fit in this pattern <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>person,</b> and he saw an opportunity to change that. Soichiro Honda was at the time tired of listening to Fujisawa talk about his new motorcycle idea; Honda came to Europe to win the Isle of Man TT race and wanted to think about little else.|$|E

2500|$|Sebastian Kneipp {{was born}} in Germany and he {{considered}} his own role in hydropathy {{to be that of}} continuing Preissnitz's work. Kneipp's own practice of hydropathy was even gentler than the norm. He believed that typical hydropathic practices deployed were [...] "too violent or too frequent" [...] and he expressed concern that such techniques would cause emotional or physical trauma to the patient. Kneipp's practice was more all encompassing than Preissnitz's, and his practice involved not only curing the patients' physical woes, but emotional and mental as well. He introduced four additional principles to the therapy: medicinal herbs, massages, balanced nutrition, and [...] "regulative therapy to seek inner balance". [...] Kneipp had a very simple view of an already simple practice. For him, hydropathy's primary goals were strengthening the constitution and removing poisons and toxins in the body. These basic interpretations of how hydropathy worked hinted at his complete lack of medical training. Kneipp did have, however, a very successful medical practice in spite of, perhaps even because of, his lack of medical training.

40|$|Decreasing {{size and}} power {{requirements}} of wearable microelectronics {{make it possible}} to replace batteries with systems that capture energy from the user’s environment. Unobtrusive devices developed at the MIT Media Lab scavenge electricity from the forces exerted on a shoe during walking: a flexible piezoelectric foil stave to harness sole-bending energy and a reinforced PZT dimorph to capture heel-strike energy. Consumer reliance on wearable electronic devices has grown significantly in the past decade. With increasing use come demands for decreased size and enhanced capabilities, necessitating new ways to supply electric energy to these devices. Until now, chemical-cell batteries have been sufficient, but replacing them is a costly nuisance, and this solution will become less practical as demands evolve. Another approach is a centralized, body-worn power pack, with multiple distribution lines, but such a system will be cumbersome and impractical as the user wears more devices. Fortunately, as power requirements drop for body-worn devices, a third approach, which eliminates the power wiring problem, is emerging: developing and storing electric energy at the devices themselves by scavenging waste energy from human activities. <b>For</b> example, <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>person</b> spends {{a significant part of the}} day on foot, dissipating abundant energy into the insole of a shoe.
