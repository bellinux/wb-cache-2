5|$|The {{discovery}} and isolation of radium in uranium ore (pitchblende) by Marie Curie sparked {{the development of}} uranium mining to extract the radium, which was used to make glow-in-the-dark paints for clock and aircraft dials. This left a prodigious quantity of uranium as a waste product, since it takes three tonnes of uranium to extract one gram of radium. This waste product was diverted to the glazing industry, making uranium <b>glazes</b> very inexpensive and abundant. Besides the pottery <b>glazes,</b> uranium tile <b>glazes</b> accounted {{for the bulk of}} the use, including common bathroom and kitchen tiles which can be produced in green, yellow, mauve, black, blue, red and other colors.|$|E

5|$|Borax, its mineral form {{then known}} as tincal, <b>glazes</b> were used in China from AD 300, and some crude borax reached the West, where the Persian alchemist Jābir ibn Hayyān {{apparently}} mentioned it in AD 700. Marco Polo brought some <b>glazes</b> back to Italy in the 13th century. Agricola, around 1600, reports the use of borax as a flux in metallurgy. In 1777, boric acid was recognized in the hot springs (soffioni) near Florence, Italy, and became known as sal sedativum, with primarily medical uses. The rare mineral is called sassolite, which is found at Sasso, Italy. Sasso was {{the main source of}} European borax from 1827 to 1872, when American sources replaced it. Boron compounds were relatively rarely used until the late 1800s when Francis Marion Smith's Pacific Coast Borax Company first popularized and produced them in volume at low cost.|$|E
5|$|Ceramic {{industry}} consumes {{a significant}} amount of zinc oxide, in particular in ceramic glaze and frit compositions. The relatively high heat capacity, thermal conductivity and high temperature stability of ZnO coupled with a comparatively low coefﬁcient of expansion are desirable properties in the production of ceramics. ZnO affects the melting point and optical properties of the <b>glazes,</b> enamels, and ceramic formulations. Zinc oxide as a low expansion, secondary ﬂux improves the elasticity of <b>glazes</b> by reducing the change in viscosity as a function of temperature and helps prevent crazing and shivering. By substituting ZnO for BaO and PbO, the heat capacity is decreased and the thermal conductivity is increased. Zinc in small amounts improves the development of glossy and brilliant surfaces. However, in moderate to high amounts, it produces matte and crystalline surfaces. With regard to color, zinc has a complicated inﬂuence.|$|E
5|$|Cobalt {{compounds}} {{have been}} used for centuries to impart a rich blue color to glass, <b>glazes,</b> and ceramics.

40|$|Homes {{with single}} <b>glazing</b> {{represent}} {{a large majority}} of the New Zealand housing stock. With the recent changes to the NZ Building Code Clause H 1 Energy Efficiency, new homes require higher <b>glazing</b> thermal performance. This will lead to an increased need for cost effective methods to improve window thermal performance in existing single <b>glazed</b> homes without completely replacing the windows, which includes 'secondary' <b>glazing.</b> There are several secondary <b>glazing</b> options available including 'stick-on' plastic <b>glazing</b> as well as aluminium framed glass solutions that are installed inside the existing joinery. Secondary <b>glazing</b> is marketed as a cost effective alternative to insulated <b>glazing</b> units, providing both improved acoustic and thermal insulation to existing windows. There is little information regarding the in-use performance and cost benefits of secondary <b>glazing</b> in New Zealand. This thesis explores the efficacy of the secondary <b>glazing</b> products when installed in existing single pane frames. A guarded hotbox was used to make thermal resistance measurements on a typical single <b>glazed</b> aluminium window with timber reveal liner. Four common secondary <b>glazing</b> systems were retrofitted into the window - (1) thin plastic film; (2) magnetically-attached acrylic sheet; (3) aluminium framed secondary glazing; and (4) aluminium framed low emissivity (low-E) secondary <b>glazing.</b> Models of 'typical' New Zealand homes created in the ALF building thermal simulation programme were used to explore the heating energy savings and cost benefits provided by the different secondary <b>glazing</b> systems in a range of locations. Of the tested products, the low-E secondary <b>glazing</b> produces the largest cost-benefits. At current energy and material costs, secondary <b>glazing</b> was found to not be a financially viable solution in warmer climates such as Auckland. In cooler climates such as Christchurch and Dunedin, secondary <b>glazing</b> was found to be a cost effective retrofit alternative for existing single <b>glazed</b> home...|$|R

Since the early eighteenth century the house has been owned by the Elton family, who were responsible for much building work on the house and many improvements in the town, and although the house itself is now owned by the National Trust, the associated estates are still owned by the Elton family. Sir Edmund Elton (1846–1920) was a potter who produced unusually shaped ware in a variety of richly-coloured <b>glazes,</b> including a gold glaze of his own invention, at the Clevedon Elton Sunflower Pottery.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the price rose rapidly {{as a result}} of {{increasing}} demand for bismuth as a metallurgical additive to aluminium, iron and steel. This was followed by a decline owing to increased world production, stabilized consumption, and the recessions of 1980 and 1981–82. In 1984, the price began to climb as consumption increased worldwide, especially in the United States and Japan. In the early 1990s, research began on the evaluation of bismuth as a nontoxic replacement for lead in ceramic <b>glazes,</b> fishing sinkers, food-processing equipment, free-machining brasses for plumbing applications, lubricating greases, and shot for waterfowl hunting. Growth in these areas remained slow during the middle 1990s, in spite of the backing of lead replacement by the US Government, but intensified around 2005. This resulted in a rapid and continuing increase in price.|$|E

5|$|Lead {{compounds}} {{are used}} as, or in, coloring agents, oxidants, plastic, candles, glass, and semiconductors. Lead-based coloring agents {{are used in}} ceramic <b>glazes</b> and glass, especially for red and yellow shades. Lead tetraacetate and lead dioxide are used as oxidizing agents in organic chemistry. Lead is frequently used in the polyvinyl chloride coating of electrical cords. It {{can be used to}} treat candle wicks to ensure a longer, more even burn. Because of its toxicity, European and North American manufacturers use alternatives such as zinc. Lead glass is composed of 12–28% lead oxide, changing its optical characteristics and reducing the transmission of ionizing radiation. Lead-based semiconductors such as lead telluride and lead selenide are used in photovoltaic cells and infrared detectors.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of uranium}} {{in its natural}} oxide form dates back to at least the year 79 CE, when {{it was used to}} add a yellow color to ceramic <b>glazes.</b> Yellow glass with 1% uranium oxide was found in a Roman villa on Cape Posillipo in the Bay of Naples, Italy, by R. T. Gunther of the University of Oxford in 1912. Starting in the late Middle Ages, {{pitchblende}} was extracted from the Habsburg silver mines in Joachimsthal, Bohemia (now Jáchymov in the Czech Republic), and was used as a coloring agent in the local glassmaking industry. In the early 19th century, the world's only known sources of uranium ore were these mines.|$|E
5|$|Before its {{purchase}} by the Amon Carter Museum of American Art, The Swimming Hole {{appears to}} have undergone seven different conservatory treatments. It may have been restored prior to its inclusion in Eakins' memorial exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1917. A photograph from that time reveals cracks in the <b>glazes</b> and a drip mark, possibly caused by the splash of a caustic liquid. After the painting was acquired by the Fort Worth Art Association, it was often lent out for exhibitions and was damaged as a result. In 1937 it was relined by a private gallery in New York City and the drip was painted out. In 1944 it was relined and restored and in 1947 it was restored again, both times by a private New York dealer. The Brooklyn Museum performed two minor restorations in 1954 and 1957. Although it continued to travel frequently, The Swimming Hole received no comprehensive treatment until 1993.|$|E
