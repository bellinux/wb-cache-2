5|$|In March 2010, the NFL amended {{its rules}} for postseason overtime, with the rule being {{extended}} into {{the regular season}} in March 2012. If a team scores a touchdown, or if the defense scores a safety on its first possession, it is declared the winner. If it scores a field goal on its first possession, however, it then <b>kicks</b> <b>off</b> to the opposing team, which {{has an opportunity to}} score; if the score is tied again after that possession, true sudden death rules apply and whoever scores next will win.|$|E
5|$|Season 4 <b>kicks</b> <b>off</b> with Eric Taylor {{struggling}} as the East Dillon High coach. The team, {{field and}} conditions are a complete {{change from the}} privileged and sparkling conditions at West Dillon. East Dillon High resembles Odessa High from the source novel , Permian High's sister school {{and the home of}} the Odessa Bronchos, with whom they have an annual rivalry match which divides the town. The East Dillon Lions and Odessa Bronchos both wear red uniforms and are considered underdogs to the Panthers. Additionally, Odessa High and East Dillon are both underfunded and considered inferior compared to their rival school, and serve a predominately poor minority community. Additionally, the school district boundaries between East and West Dillon were intentionally drawn to ensure the majority of talented players would be zoned for West Dillon; the districts between Permian and Odessa High were drawn in a similar manner.|$|E

25|$|In an {{association}} football match, the team winning the coin toss chooses which goal to {{attack in the}} first half; the opposing team <b>kicks</b> <b>off</b> for the first half. For the second half, the teams switch ends, and the team that won the coin toss <b>kicks</b> <b>off.</b> Coin tosses are also used to decide which team has the pick of going first or second in a penalty shoot-out. Before the early-1970s introduction of the penalty shootout, coin tosses were occasionally needed to decide the outcome of tied matches. The most famous instance of this was the semifinal game of the 1968 European Championship in Italy between Italy and the Soviet Union, which finished 0-0 after extra time. Italy won, {{and went on to}} become European champions.|$|E

Their first Sunday League game, against Somerset was abandoned as a draw because of rain.|$|E

When Kali finally faces Kalki's forces, his entire family blood line is wiped out by the avatar's generals and he presumably dies from wounds inflicted by Dharma and Satya Yuga personified.
