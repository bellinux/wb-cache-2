A distinctive design {{feature of the}} Ocean was its <b>dual</b> <b>sliding</b> mechanism — when slid down in the vertical position, it revealed a telephone keypad. When slid down in the horizontal position, it revealed a 35-key QWERTY keyboard.|$|E
50|$|The trains had a saloon seating layout, {{divided into}} smaller {{sections}} by full height partitions. They {{were provided with}} either two or three sets of hand operated <b>dual</b> <b>sliding</b> doors per carriage side. Later sets were fitted with power doors. Interiors were split into smoking and no-smoking compartments until late 1978, with the abolition of smoking on trains, and carriages were designated as First or Second class until 1958, when one class travel was introduced. The trains were initially delivered without end gangways between carriages, this being a later addition.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{different}} wheelbase lengths {{were offered}} {{as well as}} <b>dual</b> <b>sliding</b> doors. Silhouettes, in keeping with their luxury positioning, offered many features as standard that were optional on competing makes and on its platform mates. In 1998, it {{became one of the}} first vehicles on the market to offer a VCR with overhead retractable LCD screen for back seat viewing, which has since become a [...] "must-have" [...] option for families with children. For 2001, the Silhouette received a minor facelift that included a new grille and front bumper.|$|E

50|$|Toyota later {{released}} a one-box van/wagon {{version of the}} LiteAce in February 1971. Initially featuring just a single sliding door {{on the passenger side}} (curbside), the van/wagon was offered in three seating configurations, of one, two, and three rows—providing for three (van), six (van), and nine (wagon) passengers, respectively. A five-door, <b>dual</b> <b>sliding</b> door version arrived in September 1973 as an option, along with a new high-roof wagon model. The nine-seater wagon was retired in 1975 as it did not satisfy new Japanese emission standards. Later in October 1976, the TownAce (R10) was released—a larger model heavily based on the M10 series LiteAce.|$|E
5000|$|The Impala {{became a}} {{separate}} series, adding a four-door hardtop and four-door sedan, to the two-door Sport Coupe and convertible.

5000|$|In a minor model {{change in}} August 1988, {{the front and}} rear of the van/wagon were redesigned, {{increasing}} the body length by 75 mm. This facelift was for Japan only. At the same time, Toyota Electronic Modulated Suspension (TEMS) was employed {{for the first time in}} a one-box wagon, and the output of the turbocharged diesel engine was boosted to [...] In September 1989, the new Super SW specification was added, and a five-door version with <b>dual</b> <b>sliding</b> doors could be specified in conjunction with the SW grade. The manual transmission increased from four- to five-gears in August 1990 along with the fitment of a center high mount stop lamp. Then in October 1991, the four-wheel drive system became available with the truck body.|$|E
5000|$|At the {{invitation}} of former Delaney & Bonnie and George Harrison, Russell played piano on Badfinger's third album, Straight Up, {{in the summer of}} 1971. The piano part complemented Pete Ham's and George Harrison's <b>dual</b> <b>slide</b> guitars on Badfinger's [...] "Day After Day". The Straight Up sessions were interrupted when many of the musicians left for New York City to participate in the Concert For Bangladesh, at which Russell performed a medley of the songs [...] "Jumpin' Jack Flash" [...] and [...] "Young Blood" [...] and sang a verse on Harrison's [...] "Beware of Darkness". Bob Dylan surprised Russell by asking him to play bass for some of Dylan's portion of the show; Russell and Harrison sang harmonies on the chorus of [...] "Just Like a Woman".|$|R
5000|$|Presentation's [...] "Noddy" [...] camera {{also had}} a companion, {{originally}} named [...] "Big Ears", which was a <b>dual</b> monochrome <b>slide</b> scanner, thus allowing in-vision changes between slides.

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{demonstrates}} that invariant regulator and superior servo performance can be obtained, compared to fixed gain controllers, through sliding mode speed {{control of a}} decoupled induction machine. The speed control scheme consists of a standard indirect vector control implementation for torque control, with a sliding mode speed controller. Assuming the bounds on the parameter variations are known, the control law is derived. The chattering of single component sliding mode controller, is eliminated by introducing a boundary layer. The performance of single component sliding mode controller with boundary layer is further improved by <b>dual</b> component <b>sliding</b> mode controller. Robustness to variation of parameters, like rotor resistance and moment of inertia are demonstrated through simulation. Results are compared with fixed gain controllers. A speed estimation algorithm is implemented and used in the sliding mode control scheme. Sensorless sliding mode control {{is found to be}} superior to fixed gain control. Further, it is established through tests that, <b>dual</b> component <b>sliding</b> mode control performs better than single component sliding mode control...|$|R

5000|$|High tibial {{osteotomy}} is an orthopaedic {{surgical procedure}} {{which aims to}} correct a varus deformation with compartmental osteoarthritis. It is usually reserved for younger patients who are generally more active (1). Angular deformities were first described by Mikulicz-Radecki in 1880. He observed that the axis of the lower extremity passes through the three joints of the hip, knee and ankle in normal individuals and the knee center deviates from this line in angular deformities of the knee. In this case, the medial compartment will bear the weight in genuvarum and lateral compartment will bear weight in genuvalgum, and osteoarthritis will develop in the mentioned compartment. High tibial osteotomy was described first by Jackson in 1958 and has nowadays become a well-established surgery. Coventry, who was a pioneer in this field, has published many reports {{on the results of}} closed wedge HTO (2). Orthopedic <b>dual</b> <b>sliding</b> compression plate (ODSCP) was designed and introduced for open wedge high tibial osteotomies. The advantages over the conventional techniques are reducing the chance of accidental intra-articular extension of the osteotomy, eliminating the potential risk of unwanted translation or rotation of the bone, ability to readjust the alignment after surgery without the need to remove the bone screws (3). Since the population in most countries is becoming aged, the genuvarum and consequently the resulting osteoarthritis will increase, and if the patient fulfills the criteria, high tibial osteotomy is advisable (4).|$|E
5000|$|The SDV program {{dates back}} to World War II. Initiated by the Office of Strategic Services Maritime Unit (OSS MU). A “submersible canoe” was invented by the Italians during World War I [...] The idea was {{successfully}} applied by the Italian navy (Regia Marina) also early in World War II. The official Italian name for their craft was Siluro a Lenta Corsa (SLC or [...] "Slow-running torpedo"). The vehicle was then copied by the British when they discovered the Italian operations and called it the “Sleeping Beauty”. It was employed by OSS MU during extensive training and exercises, but was never actually deployed for combat operations. The same capability {{was adopted by the}} post-war Underwater Demolition Teams (UDTs) in 1947. The one-man submersible displayed little functional military potential; however, it substantiated and characterized the need for improved and expanded UDT capabilities.After the war, development continued in a garage-shop fashion by various UDT units, and included various [...] "Marks" [...] as the MK V, VI, VII, and XII. Intermediate numbers were assigned to some vehicles that never made it off the shop floor. All were of flooded design.

5000|$|Third {{generation}} {{models were}} sold as the Plymouth Voyager, Dodge Caravan and Chrysler Town & Country. The Caravan and Voyager {{were available in}} either 3 or 4 door configurations on either a standard model or an extended wheelbase model known as the Grand Voyager and Grand Caravan, respectively. The Town & Country was only available in a long wheelbase configuration, with either 3 or 4 doors. Caravan trim levels were largely carried over from the previous generation, offered in Base, SE, and {{top of the line}} ES models, while a Sport package was available on short wheelbase SE models. Caravan ES models came with more options than before, featuring a standard Infinity sound system, a power driver's seat, dual-zone climate control, deluxe cloth seating (leather was optional) and alloy wheels, among other features. As part of Chrysler's new corporate strategy to better focus the Plymouth brand on entry-level vehicles, Voyagers and were only available in base trim and better-equipped SE models, although a high end LE trim which was largely a clone of the Caravan ES was available in Canada. A Rallye option package continued to be available on SE model, being the de facto top of the line Voyager. It was renamed [...] "Expresso" [...] for 1998. The Town & Country was now available in two different trims, the LX and LXi. On the Voyager and Caravan, the trims were easily distinguished by their body-side moldings. Base models used a narrow accent color strip and SE models used a wide accent color strip, with Voyager SEs with the Rallye package receiving [...] "Rallye" [...] badges on the front doors. Caravan ES and Voyager LEs used the base model's narrow accent color molding combined with a full accent color effect on the lower portion of the doors. The vinyl woodgrain-appearance side paneling was no longer available, as the new side sheetmetal was no longer flat. Early Plymouth Voyagers had a Pentastar front logo and rear badges using the same font as the Caravan, which was changed to Plymouth's new [...] "sailboat" [...] logo and script font on the badges by calendar year 1996. Voyagers and Caravans were only differentiated by their grilles, and some wheel options, while The Town & Country received plastic lower side cladding with chrome strips, unique wheels and a chrome waterfall grille with the Chrysler brand's new ribbon logo. Unique features for the Town & Country included as pre-programmed driver's seat and mirror, standard leather interior, 8-way power adjustable front seats, Infinity sound system with cassette/CD player. As with previous generations, the NS minivan was exported as the Chrysler Voyager, which was a Dodge Caravan modified to meet European safety and lighting standards, while for the 2000 model year it received the Plymouth Voyager's front fascia.In 1997, the Town & Country received standard <b>dual</b> <b>sliding</b> doors and a short wheelbase SX model (not available in Canada), and in 1998 it received a new front fascia, headlamps and wheels. Also in 1998, the Caravan SE dropped, replaced with a new [...] "Sport" [...] model that came with a completely color keyed body, rear spoiler and new wheels, and the Plymouth Voyager Rallye was renamed Expresso, while all models got grocery bag hooks installed on the rear seats. In 1999, the Caravan received standard <b>dual</b> <b>sliding</b> doors, as well as new front fascias, the ES model received revised trim, the [...] "AutoStick" [...] transmission and 17 inch wheels. With the discontinuation of the Plymouth brand, Voyagers produced late in the 2000 model year became Chrysler Voyagers, though they didn't receive any of the trim or options of the European export model.|$|E

40|$|A new {{nonlinear}} filtering algorithm for effectively denoising images {{corrupted by}} the random-valued impulse noise, called <b>dual</b> <b>sliding</b> statistics switching median (DSSSM) filter {{is presented in}} this paper. The proposed DSSSM filter {{is made up of}} two subunits; i. e. impulse noise detection and noise filtering. Initially, the impulse noise detection stage of DSSSM algorithm begins by processing the statistics of a localized detection window in sorted order and non-sorted order, simultaneously. Next, the median of absolute difference (MAD) obtained from both sorted statistics and non-sorted statistics will be further processed in order to classify any possible noise pixels. Subsequently, the filtering stage will replace the detected noise pixels with the estimated median value of the surrounding pixels. In addition, fuzzy based local information is used in the filtering stage to help the filter preserves the edges and details. Extensive simulations results conducted on gray scale images indicate that the DSSSM filter performs significantly better than a number of well-known impulse noise filters existing in literature in terms of noise suppression and detail preservation; with as much as 30 % impulse noise corruption rate. Finally, this DSSSM filter is algorithmically simple and suitable to be implemented for electronic imaging product...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of digital}} {{image-based}} visual information {{has gained a}} lot of attention due to its flexibility and easy to be manipulated. However, digital images that have been used as basic input to an application system are frequently contaminated by noise. One of the most common types of noise found in digital images is impulse noise. Therefore, two new types of filters based on switching scheme are proposed as impulse noise removal. Both filters namely <b>Dual</b> <b>Sliding</b> Statistics Switching Median filter (MPSDG) and Adroit Hybrid Switching Median filter (MPHM) are two-stage filters which consist of noise detection and noise filtering stages. In the MPSDG method, the filtering process begins with noise detection stage; whereby the statistics of a localized detection window of sorted and non-sorted orders are simultaneously processed. Subsequently, the median of absolute difference obtained from the statistics of both windows will be used to classify the existence of the noise pixel. Next in the filtering stage, the pixels that have been classified as noise will be restored while the noise-free pixels will be left unchanged. Meanwhile in the MPHM technique, the statistics in the local window detectors are arranged in ascending order and the difference of each data with the median value will be calculated. Then all of the obtained difference values will be processed in the next steps and threshold values will be used to distinguish between the noise pixels and noise-free pixels. Once the noise detection process is completed, all the noise pixels are replaced with the estimated median value in the next filtering stage. By using these processing techniques, the proposed filters are not only able to remove the impulse noise, but are also able to maintain the structure and shape of the object in the image. The simulation results also show that the MPSDG and MPHM filters outperform other existing conventional filters in the literature, in terms of qualitative and quantitative assessments...|$|E

40|$|The title 'Changing Light' {{reflects}} the enormous changeover from analogue slides to digital images, both a cultural shift and a physical shift {{down to the}} change in light from the smoky beams of <b>dual</b> <b>slide</b> projectors piercing the dark of a classroom, to the bright white classrooms of the digital age. The evidence for the 'death of slides' has been mounting {{for a number of}} years and reported by visual resources curators in the US and the UK. In 2005 JISC funded AHDS Visual Arts to report on 'the effects of the digital image revolution on the UK arts education community'; the Association of Curators of Art and Design Images (ACADI), the Association of Art Historians (AAH), and the Art Libraries Society (ARLIS/UK & Ireland) contributed significantly to the Digital Picture initiative. However some of the issues highlighted by the final report are yet to be addressed such as provision of copyright-cleared digital images for use in education. This paper considers what arts education stands to lose from the 'death of slides' in the context of digital images and the plethora of digital presentation tools. As well as a change in light, there is a change from the physical tangible slide technology to the virtual digital image and computing in the cloud...|$|R
