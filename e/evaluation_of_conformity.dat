40|$|In this paper, a short {{discussion}} is presented on some important considerations of spatial data fusion. The {{discussion is}} motivated by the frequent lack of prescient project preparation and the possible additional costs and delays that are caused by this absence. Especially when multi-source modelling {{is involved in a}} spatial context, the definition of the user requirements, the modelling purpose and the possible data specifications are indispensable. These definitions have to be clarified even before the data acquisition takes place and they determine the development of the processing workflow. After the data acquisition, two other important phases in the modelling process are the <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>conformity</b> <b>of</b> the data model and the data validation. These phases are obviously linked with the predefined requirements. The importance of these phases are emphasized and motivated in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The paper {{presents}} {{the method of}} high - speed steels’ secondary hardness modeling, basing on chemical composition and heat-treatment parameters. Design/methodology/approach: The computer modeling using statistical regression method were carried out basing on results of investigations of newly developed high - speed steels and rough data included in standards containing information about these steels. Findings: The models developed in the work was experimentally verified. The verification procedure consists <b>of</b> the <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>conformity</b> <b>of</b> the computational results with the experimental data. The obtained results indicate good <b>conformity</b> <b>of</b> calculations with experimental results since the error of calculations is c. a. 0. 8 HRC. Research limitations/implications: The results presented are valid in the ranges of mass concentrations of alloying elements occurring in analyzed steels group and presented in the paper.

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{compatibility}} of scientific voices {{with the needs}} to combat forest fire as perceived by relevant stakeholders through a review of scholarly output, an <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>conformity</b> between scientists and stakeholder views on forest fire issues, and an analysis of how different types of scientists and voice channels contribute the local needs to combat forest fire in Indonesia. This research indicates that although forest fire has cross-country border impacts, forest fire discourses were dominated by home country issues rather than the concerns of global forest fire events. Further, although information about forest fire is widely available in the scientific journals, the “knowledge utilization” of this information remains low. To improve “knowledge utilization”, scientists can use different channels to disseminate information, in addition to scientific journals. While socialeconomic aspects {{are perceived to be}} the prime problem of forest fire in Indonesia, the minimal presentation of social scientists within forest fire discourse is a concern. To address these primary concerns within and outside scientific journals, the involvement of social scientists within the forest fire discourse is very important. ...|$|R

40|$|When only {{a limited}} number of test results are available, {{compressive}} strength results of concrete family members can be combined in order to enable conformity control on a sufficient number of test results. The principles behind the conformity control of concrete families are explained and an original probabilistic <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>conformity</b> criteria for concrete families is introduced. For the calculation of the corresponding operating characteristics, some approximate formulae are presented. Additionally, Monte Carlo simulation techniques are used for more exact calculations. In this way, also autocorrelation between consecutive test results can be taken into account, using an autoregressive process. The current guidelines and conformity criteria for concrete families in EN 206 - 1 are evaluated and discussed, based on the AOQL concept.
