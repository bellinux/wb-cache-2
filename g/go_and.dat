At the entrance to the vélodrome, there were crowds everywhere, blocking the way. I looked around for where to <b>go</b> <b>and</b> I was directed round the outside wall of the track, to where the team cars had to park. It wasn't like nowadays, when there's television and everything. Then it was more chaotic and the whole road was blocked. People said I should have known the way into the track. But how do you know a thing like {{that at the end of}} Paris–Roubaix, when you've raced all day over roads like that? A gendarme signalled the way to <b>go</b> <b>and</b> that's the way I went.|$|E
