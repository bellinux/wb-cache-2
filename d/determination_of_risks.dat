The {{aim of this study}} was to prove the significance of salivary carboanhydrase activity determination in estimation of caries risk in children. Methods. The study included 123 children of average age of 13. 4 ± 0. 3 years and permanent dentition. The children were divided into two groups according to caries risk (low and high caries risk groups). Two samples of saliva - unstimulated and stimulated one were taken from each child. Salivary carboanhydrase activity, as well as pH value, bicarbonate and phosphate buffer levels were estimated in both group of saliva samples. Results. The investigation showed significantly higher carboanhydrase activity (p < 0. 001) in both saliva samples in low caries risk group compared to high caries risk one. In children with low caries risk, both unstimulated and stimulated saliva show significantly higher bicarbonate and phosphate buffer concentrations (p < 0. 001), as well as pH values. Conclusion. The lower caries incidence could be expected in children with high carboanhydrase activity and higher salivary buffer system parameters levels. The presented results suggest that salivary carboanhydrase activity represents the important marker of individual susceptibility for caries appearance in children...|$|E
40|$|Background: Ehrlichiosis is an {{emerging}} tick-borne zoonotic disease {{caused by the}} family of Anaplasmatacea. Re­cently, outbreak of human monocytic ehrlichiosis was reported in northern part of Iran. Besides, serological evidence of canine monocytic ehrlichiosis caused by Ehrlichia canis was reported from southeastern of Iran but the epidemi­ology of this disease is almost undetermined in Iran. The present {{study was designed to}} use PCR for detection of Ehrlichia spp. in tick infested household dogs and <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> of disease transmission to dog’s owners. Method: Blood samples were prepared from 100 tick infested household dogs after complete clinical examination. Complete cell blood count was done for each sample. DNA extraction was done and PCR was carried out by a com­mercial kit afterwards. Regarding to PCR results, blood samples were collected from owners and family members who were exposed to infected and non-infected dogs. A similar method was utilized for DNA extraction and PCR in human samples. Result: Ehrlichial DNA was detected by PCR in six percent of Rhipicephalus sanguineus tick pools and 9 % of the examined dogs. No positive sample was detected among the 67 examined human bloods. Conclusion: Ehrlichiosis could be considered as {{an emerging}} canine disease but owning a dog should not be consid­ered a major risk factor for ehrlichiosis in humans. Further serological and molecular studies in different parts of Iran are required to clarify the epidemiology of ehrlichiosis in canine, ticks, and human population.  </p...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{noticeable}} {{proportion of}} colorectal cancer (CRC) patients are diagnosed with synchronous CRC. Large population-based {{studies on the}} incidence, risk factors and prognosis of synchronous CRC are, however, scarce, and are needed for better <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> of synchronous CRC in patients diagnosed with colonic neoplasia. METHODS: All newly diagnosed CRC between 1995 and 2006 {{were obtained from the}} Rotterdam Cancer Registry in The Netherlands, and studied for synchronous CRC. RESULTS: Of the 13, 683 patients diagnosed with CRC, 534 patients (3. 9 %) were diagnosed with synchronous CRC. The risk of having synchronous CRC was significantly higher in men (OR 1. 54, 95 % CI 1. 29 - 1. 84) and in patients aged > 70 years (OR 1. 83, 95 % CI 1. 39 - 2. 40). Synchronous CRC patients had a significantly higher risk of distant metastases (OR 1. 69, 95 % CI 1. 27 - 2. 26). In 34 % (184 / 534) the two tumours were located in different surgical segments. Five-year relative survival of synchronous CRC was similar to patients with solitary CRC after multivariate adjustment for the presence of distant metastases. CONCLUSION: One out of 25 patients diagnosed with CRC presents with synchronous CRC. In the multivariate analysis, survival of patients with synchronous CRC was similar to patients with solitary CRC, when corrected for the presence of distant metastases at first presentation. One third of the synchronous CRC were located in different surgical segments, which stresses the importance of performing total colon examination preferably prior to surgery...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe current {{environmental}} {{background is}} modifying human behaviour in every society. Indeed, {{one of the}} main causes of global warming is the emission of greenhouse gases, including mainly CO 2. Several ways have been found to gradually reduce the CO 2 emissions, among them the Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) process. This is a technique which extends the use of fossil energies while giving necessary time for renewable energies to develop on a large scale. The CO 2 is captured, brought to the storage site, and injected either into dried up oil and gas deposits or into unworkable coal seams or into deep saline aquifers. Long-term monitoring of the storage site is maintained afterward. The question pending, and a source of controversy, relates to the underground evolution of the CO 2 in the medium- and long-term. The aim is to lead preliminary <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> on a generic basis. Projects are managed and storage installations built on a global scale. Depending on the country, the risk approach is not the same. Mostly, only the FEP method is used - accident scenarios are built up based on several events and cumulated processes. This study develops the MOSAR method (Organized and Systemic Method of Risk Analysis) to analyse the technical risks of a human plant and to identify the prevention means to neutralize them. The innovative side of this work is that we have created a typology grid of under-systems hazard sources adapted to a CO 2 geological storage site. Risk scenarios can then be built and organized hierarchically in a grid by means of gravity based on probability. Once this is done, this study leads to the identification of prevention and protection means. Similar to most systemic methods for risk analysis, this MOSAR method is time consuming in order to define all risks and scenarios. However, the software tool facilitates this work and we show in this paper that the method is efficient...|$|E
40|$|Coastal {{zones are}} highly {{vulnerable}} {{to climate change}} and its variability. Future projections {{of global climate change}} suggest that relative sea-level rise and increased storm frequencies could lead to significant increases in coastal flooding and shoreline erosion. Associated with this, it is likely that coastal hazards can have the potential to disrupt landfill sites located in dynamic coastal areas. This could be a determining factor in an accidental release of hazardous contaminants which may cause pollution risks to the local environment. The objectives of this research, thus, were to better understand how coastal landfill sites might interact with coastal hazards and to investigate associated current & future risks, and their implication on future environmental and shoreline management issues under climate change. The first step was to develop a source-consequence flowchart using Source-Pathway-Receptor-Consequence approach to investigate how the different pathways, associated with coastal hazards at a case study area of Pennington, contribute to the risks of contaminant release from waste sites. Then attempt was made to identify and quantify sites at risk of coastal hazards. Linked to this, saltmarsh change and sea defence performance analysis were performed. Finally, possible mitigation measures were investigated to address the issues. It was identified that the risks associated with erosion and flooding happen to be more relevant. Results also reveal that the eroding saltmarshes could only provide a declining natural defence and will completely be lost by 2085, if not sooner. This leads to significant increase in wave action on the seawall which may eventually lead to breaching; as it was designed assuming it is fronted by sufficient width of saltmarshes. It was estimated that, under a 1 -in- 20 year storm event most sections of the seawall will experience significant overflow and wave overtopping and it is more than 75 % likely that the highest seawall section will breach before 2055 by which realignment option is proposed. This leads to seawater flooding significant portion of the landfills. This may arise high implication on future environmental & management issues, unless measures are taken. The study suggested that abandoning further waste disposal and relocating existing waste out of vulnerable sites seems reasonably sustainable and cost effective than protecting it. However, it was recommended that further studies on the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> and its future implications based {{on a wide range of}} climatic, environmental and socio-economic scenarios would give a broader picture of the issues involved & to be able to address them for a better future environment and shoreline management.

Water {{is a life}} source without {{alternative}} for creatures living on earth. Creatures have developed projects for the optimal use of water due to several purposes {{in order to make}} use of water. One of these projects is dams. While aspects such as detailed project designing, error-free production and optimal operating conditions have utmost importance in construction of dams, <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> that may arise during production or operation of the structure and taking required measures against such risks are not less significant. Within this context, anticipating the risk groups, requiring improvement to prevent dam accidents experienced in the past and aiming to protect the life in the surrounding in addition to the structure, dam safety issue has gained importance in the recent years. In addition to available dams, dam safety concerns subjects such as project design, production, operation and maintenance of dams to be constructed. Today, attaining a legal and technical infrastructure in many developed countries, the issue of dam safety is being advancing gradually every other day in our country through universities, associations, congresses and administrative mechanisms. Addressing dam safety, within scope of this study, In the Chapter 1, dam safety and the required importance for the risks affecting the dams are explained. Mankind's need for water throughout the history is emphasized and the need for building dams for this requirement is stated. Dams in the world and in Turkey are addressed. It is also stated that the current conditions require economic use of water.   It is explained that safety of the dams is a very important issue both in the national and international level. Despite this, while the current situation clearly shows the hazards, it is reminded that only a few countries have a fully equipped dam safety program. In {{the last part of the}} chapter, the roadmap of the study is stated. In the Chapter 2, the concepts of hazard and safety are explained. It is stated that despite the technological advancement, natural disaster still pose a threat for humanity. It was explained that the big constructions like dams may pose not only known hazards, but also unusual hazards. Land solution procedures in relation to the concept of hazard are listed.   The importance of the concept of safety in engineering, which is defined as the case not posing hazard, is emphasized. Hazard and safety are discussed along with the risk factor, and displayed in a chart. Additionally, topics regarding the risks posed in the dams are mentioned. These topics are discussed in the framework of safety. The other professions effective in addition to construction engineering are stated in terms of dam safety. 3 ways, through which the dam safety is monitored in different disciplines, are given. These 3 ways are respectively prevention, control and decreasing. Stability of the dams providing the society with such advantages as energy, irrigation water, flood control and recreation, is examined. It is highlighted that while trial and error method has been common in the first years of dam construction, now research and development is important.   It is underlined that the dams, which are built more and more making use of the technology, are now constructed on less suitable spots. It is stated that because the dams directly affect security of life and property both during their construction and operation, risk calculations have to be made more carefully and meticulously and should be frequently checked. The last part of the chapter is spared for the reasons and factors of the insufficiencies in the dams. It is stated that the most effective issue in dam destruction is insufficiency. Structural destruction and performance destruction are discussed and it is stated that the dams are designed according to the concept of structural destruction. Factors creating the insufficiency are listed and explained with examples. In this context, examples of the dam accidents that arose due to the insufficiencies and lead to loss of life and property are given. In the Chapter 3, the subject of examining current dams and measurement tools in the fill dams are analyzed. Examination issues are stated and the importance of particularly the dam body is highlighted. Importance of anticipations in examination is stated. Concept of examination is divided into types and separate principles are explained.   The second part of the chapter is on measurement and measurement equipment. It is stated that through dam measurement devices, equipment are placed on the dam body or its several spots and it is possible to monitor dam's actions in time. In this context, dam measurement devices are listed and explained. Forms of the relevant equipment used in the worksite in fill dam construction are explained in figures. After that, the assessment and analysis procedures required as a result of the examinations and measurements are emphasized.   In the Chapter 4, the concept of risk is addressed and importance of risk in engineering is discussed. After explaining the concept of risk, possible risks to be encountered in the construction industry are stated. Risks in the construction industry are listed and measures to be taken against these risks are explained. Controllable and uncontrollable risks are explained and their dependence on the design, workmanship standard and quality of the used material is analyzed.   Complete and partial dependence of the risks in the construction sector are emphasized. The terms of static risk and speculative risk are explained. It is stated that the construction projects host several uncertainties arising from various factors. It is discussed that at this point, risk analysis is an essential fact. It is also stated that risk analysis has become compulsory for some projects and this type of projects are listed. The basic issue in risk analysis is that risk estimates have to be conducted realistically and the results have to be correctly interpreted and expressed concretely with a realistic approach. The last part of the chapter is spared for determining the risk groups for the dams. In this part, a risk potential classification table for the dams is given. Within the framework of the regarding table, dams have to be assigned risk points depending on their qualities and the area they affect. It is explained that as a result of the related points, risk class of the dams is revealed. In the Chapter 5, Atatürk Dam, which is the largest dam in Turkey, is introduced with its importance. The geodesic deformation measurement procedures for Atatürk Dam are explained. It is stated that the horizontal and vertical measurements are made with the classical or satellite based measurements conducted periodically on the deformation networks created for this purpose. Geodesic and non-geodesic measurements, as well as the tools used in these measurements are explained. It is stated that several deformation points are placed on the dam body and the regions to create movement with these points are selected. It is explained that the deformation network is created as a result of the relevant regions. Perpendicular movements arising as a result of the deformation network are given in table. Kriging method for calculating the perpendicular movements arising as a result of the deformation networks is explained in detail. Explanation of Kriging method is supported with an example. Via Surfer_ 10 software, perpendicular movements on Atatürk Dam are modeled with Kriging method. Coordinates and perpendicular movements in the deformation network are taken as basis in modeling. With the interpolation-based Kringing method, data on the dam body are obtained. Variation diagram of the created model is drawn. Efficiency of the model is calculated under a separate title. Values of the created model are compared with the data obtained from 15 th Regional Directorate of State Hydraulic Works. The difference arisen as a result of the assessment is explained and the required calculations are conducted. While making the calculations, a part is taken from the section of the dam posing risk on the dam crest. Then, 174 -month sitting graph is obtained for this section. 5 -year data from this graph is selected according to the model's period and analyzed. As a result, it is determined that the calculation provides 90. 71 % of reliability. In the Chapter 6, it is emphasized that as the dams are huge constructions, their designs have to be made very carefully and meticulously. It is stated that many people lose their lives due to dam destructions and serious damages occur. It was highlighted that for safe operation of the dams, they have to be monitored periodically throughout their lives.   In the last part of the section, the model created as a result of this study is analyzed. Sinking on Atatürk Dam's body that arose between May 2006 and December 2011 are assessed. Model's efficiency is emphasized. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E
