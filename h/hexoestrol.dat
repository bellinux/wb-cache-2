50|$|Hexestrol (INN) (brand name Synestrol, Synoestrol, Estrifar, Estronal, {{numerous}} others), {{also known}} as hexanestrol, <b>hexoestrol,</b> and dihydrodiethylstilbestrol, is a synthetic, nonsteroidal estrogen of the stilbestrol group related to diethylstilbestrol {{that was used to}} treat estrogen deficiency but is now no longer employed medically. Hexestrol has also been available and used in ester form, including as hexestrol diacetate, hexestrol dicaprylate, hexestrol diphosphate, and hexestrol dipropionate. Hexestrol has approximately 302% and 234% of the affinity of estradiol at the ERα and ERβ, respectively. Along with diethylstilbestrol, hexestrol {{is one of the most}} potent estrogens known.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{synthetic}} oestrogens diethylstilboestrol, <b>hexoestrol</b> and 17 α-ethynyloestradiol {{are known to}} be carcinogenic, yet they all exert antioxidant properties in vitro in that they are good inhibitors of iron ion-dependent lipid peroxidation. In rat liver microsomes incubated with Fe(III) -ascorbate or Fe(III) -ADP/NADPH and also in ox-brain phospholipid liposomes incubated with Fe(III) -ascorbate; the overall order of effectiveness of the compounds tested as inhibitors of lipid peroxidation was diethylstilboestrol ⪢ <b>hexoestrol</b> ⪢ 17 α-ethynyloestradiol ⪢ 4 -hydroxytamoxifen ⪢ 17 β-oestradiol ⪢ tamoxifen.

40|$|Groups of {{male and}} female mice were gonadectomized and some {{implanted}} with a pellet of <b>hexoestrol.</b> Half of the animals in each group, including controls, were infected with a low-virulence strain of Toxoplasma gondii. The animals were killed 6 weeks after infection. Gonadectomy increased the relative thymic weight in both sexes, but more so in the male, and the paracortical area of the lymph node was enlarged, as was the thymus-dependent area of the spleen. <b>Hexoestrol</b> administration induced almost complete thymic atrophy and partial involution of the peripheral lymphoid tissues. Greater resistance to toxoplasmic infection was found in the gonadectomized mice than in controls of both sexes, possibly due to a better cell-mediated immunity in the gonadectomized animals. Overwhelming toxoplasmosis with increased mortality was found in the hexoestrol-treated mice after infection, probably resulting from a depression of cell-mediated immunity caused by <b>hexoestrol.</b> It is postulated that the cellular immune response is of greater importance than the formation of antibody in resistance to toxoplasmic infection. The role of the thymolmphatic [...] sex hormonal interrelation on the age [...] sex differences seen in the incidence of toxoplasmic lymphadenopathy is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|STUDIES in vivo on the {{incorporation}} of oestrogens by the uteri of immature rats (Jenson and Jacobson, 1962) and of ovariectomised mice (Stone, 1963), and on {{the incorporation}} of radioactivity by the ventral prostate and seminal vesicles of the male rat after injection of [14 C] testosterone (Greer, 1959) suggest that steroids may be selectively incorporated by those tissues whose growth is dependent on their presence. Such steroids might also be selectively incorporated by those breast carcinomas of humans which are influenced by steroids. Evidence of a link in humans between the " hormone-dependency " of breast carcinomas {{and the ability of}} such carcinomas to incorporate <b>hexoestrol</b> (3, 4 -bis-(parahydroxy-phenyl) -n-hexane) was obtained by Folca, Glascock and Irvine (1961). In those patients who subsequently responded favourably to bilateral adrenalectomy and oophorectomy there was a selective incorporation of radioactivity by breast metastases removed 6 hours after intravenous injection of tritiated <b>hexoestrol.</b> More recently, Desphande, Bulbrook and Ellis (1963) found that 6 hours after intravenous injection of tritiated testosterone there ha...|$|E
40|$|Numerous Foà-Kurloff (FK) {{cells have}} been found in the circulation, spleen, bone marrow, thymus and {{placenta}} of guinea pigs under endogenous or exogenous oestrogenic stimulation. The origin of these cells is obscure. In the present experiment, the distribution of FK cells in organs other than those stated above was studied following gonadectomy and <b>hexoestrol</b> administration in guinea pigs of both sexes for either 1 or 10 weeks. More FK cells than those expected from the vascularity of the organ were found in the liver and lungs of male and female animals. The number of FK cells in these organs was larger after the long-term treatment with <b>hexoestrol</b> and it was accompanied by a significant {{decrease in the number of}} Kupffer cells of the liver. The latter observation is in contrast to previous reports of increased numbers of Kupffer cells in the liver of oestrogen-receiving mice, a species not producing FK cells. These observations suggest a relation between the two types of cells. No transformation of mature Kupffer cells into FK cells was seen with the electron microscope. However, other findings suggest that both Kupffer cells and FK cells may well be derived from a common precursor of MPS in the bone marrow...|$|E
40|$|The {{inhibition}} by diethylstilboestrol of DNA nucleotidyltransferase {{isolated from}} calf thymus was studied. The inhibition exercised by diethylstilboestrol appears to obey competitive kinetics {{with respect to}} DNA primer.

A comparative study of the inhibitory effects of some stilboestrol derivatives is presented. The alkyl substitution in the αα′-positions seem to alter the inhibitory effect of these compounds: dimethylstilboestrol was more inhibitory than stilbene, and diethylstilboestrol was more inhibitory than dimethylstilboestrol. <b>Hexoestrol,</b> in which the αα′-ethylenic linkage is saturated, was the most effective inhibitor...|$|E
40|$|NAD(+) -linked and NADP(+) -linked 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases were {{purified}} to homogeneity from hamster liver cytosol. The two monomeric enzymes, although having similar molecular {{masses of}} 38, 000, differed {{from each other}} in pI values, activation energy and heat stability. The two proteins also gave different fragmentation patterns by gel electrophoresis after digestion with protease. The NADP(+) -linked enzyme catalysed the oxidoreduction of various 3 alpha-hydroxysteroids, whereas the NAD(+) -linked enzyme oxidized the 3 alpha-hydroxy group of pregnanes and some bile acids, and the 17 beta-hydroxy group of testosterone and androstanes. The thermal stabilities of the 3 alpha- and 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activities of the NAD(+) -linked enzyme were identical, and the two enzyme activities were inhibited by mixing 17 beta- and 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid substrates, respectively. Medroxyprogesterone acetate, <b>hexoestrol</b> and 3 beta-hydroxysteroids competitively inhibited 3 alpha- and 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activities of the enzyme. These results show that hamster liver contains a 3 alpha(17 beta) -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase structurally and functionally distinct from 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase...|$|E
40|$|In the {{preceding}} paper [Folley & Malpress, 1944] {{it has been}} shown that lactation can be induced in maiden heifers or dry cows by the subcutaneous implantation of tablets of diethylstilboestrol (hereinafter called stilboestrol) or <b>hexoestrol.</b> Dodds, Golberg, Lawson & Robinson [1938] found that stilboestrol was almost as active in the rat, by the vaginal-smear test, when given by mouth as when subcutaneously injected. It was therefore interesting to see whether lactation could be induced in cows and heifers by oral administration of synthetic oestrogens, since the feeding method possesses obvious practical advantages. Induction of lactation in goats by oral administration of stilboestrol was reported by Lewis & Turner [1942]. MATERIAL AND METHODS Experimental animals A series of preliminary experiments was carried out on seven maiden heifers and one heifer (Regality) which had aborted early in pregnancy, each of which re-ceived individual treatment.

40|$|The role of cell-mediated {{immunity}} in {{the pathogenesis of}} toxoplasmic lesions in non-lymphoid organs and its significance in resistance to infection with Toxoplasma gondii were studied in guinea-pigs. Alteration of the sex hormonal environment in both sexes has significant effects on the immunological status of the guinea-pig, changing its reaction to toxoplasmic infection. Thus, gonadectomy appears to enhance delayed hypersensitivity, leading to a greater prominence of lesions in the non-lymphoid organs of gonadectomized male and female animals than in controls. This observation supports the possibility that delayed hypersensitivity {{plays a major role}} in the pathogenesis of non-lymphoid, toxoplasmic lesions. <b>Hexoestrol</b> administration for a long period of time induces complete thymic atrophy and severe involution of the thymus-dependent areas of the lymph nodes and spleen, leading to the suppression of {{cell-mediated immunity}} and overwhelming disease in those animals infected with Toxoplasma gondii, suggesting that cell-mediated immunity is of importance in resistance to toxoplasmic infection. In view of these findings, the difficulties in the treatment of non-lymphoid toxoplasmic lesions, such as ocular ones, by depressing cellular immunity, are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Studies {{were made}} {{on a number of}} 35 prepuberal Merinos cross breed female sheep, three months age, equally divided in three {{experimental}} groups and one control group. Females in the experimental groups were given 0. 2 ml/animal (2. 5 mg/ml) <b>hexoestrol</b> diacetate, intramuscularly. After 30, 60, 90 and 120 days respectively, blood, urine, muscle tissue (by biopsy) samples were harvested in order to determine, through electrochemioiluminescence, the concentrations of the residue of this steroidal compound. Ovaries were also harvested through ovarioectomy for histo-pathological examination. The maximum levels of this hormone residue were identified in urine (the average value being 652, 4 pg/ml, for group I), intermediate values in blood samples (43. 74 pg/ml), while the muscle samples revealed concentrations inferior to the detection limit for the utilized method (18. 4 pg/g). Atretic follicles were present in very large numbers, and the primordial follicle pool was reduced by over 50 % in the ovaries harvested from the experimental group. We can see that the hexestrol diacetate initiates and maintains the follicular atresia in young prepuberal female sheep, with drastic reduction of the follicle pool, compromising the female reproductively.

40|$|In rat ovary, 20 alpha-hydroxysteroid {{dehydrogenase}} (20 alpha-HSD), {{a member}} of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily, converts progesterone into the inactive progestin 20 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone and has been implicated in the termination of pregnancy. Here we report a convenient overexpression system that permits the purification of milligram quantities of homogeneous recombinant 20 alpha-HSD with wild-type enzyme activity. The availability of this enzyme has permitted detailed kinetic, inhibition and fluorescence analyses. The enzyme exhibited narrow steroid specificity, catalysing reactions only at C- 20; it reduced progesterone and 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone and oxidized 20 alpha-hydroxypregnanes. It also turned over common AKR substrates, such as 9, 10 -phenanthrenequinone and 4 -nitrobenzaldehyde. The intrinsic fluorescence spectrum of 20 alpha-HSD was characterized and was quenched on the binding of NADP(H), yielding a KNADPd of 0. 36 microM and a KNADPHd of 0. 64 microM. NADP(H) binding generated an energy transfer band that could not be quenched by steroids. Inhibition studies conducted with non-steroidal and steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and synthetic oestrogens indicated that even though rat ovarian 20 alpha-HSD and rat liver 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 alpha-HSD) share more than 67 % amino acid identity, their inhibition profiles are markedly different. Unlike 3 alpha-HSD, most of these compounds did not inhibit 20 alpha-HSD. Only meclofenamic acid and <b>hexoestrol</b> were potent competitive inhibitors for 20 alpha-HSD, yielding K(i) values of 18. 9 and 14. 3 microM respectively. These studies suggest that selective non-steroidal AKR inhibitors could be developed for 20 alpha-HSD that might be useful in maintaining pregnancy and that specific inhibitors might be developed from either N-phenylanthranilates or biphenols...|$|E
40|$|Human dihydrodiol {{dehydrogenase}} with 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity {{exists in}} four forms (AKR 1 C 1 - 1 C 4) {{that belong to}} the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) family. Recent crystallographic studies on the other proteins in this family have indicated a role for a tyrosine residue (corresponding to position 216 in these isoenzymes) in stacking the nicotinamide ring of the coenzyme. This tyrosine residue is conserved in most AKR family members including AKR 1 C 1 - 1 C 3, but is replaced with histidine in AKR 1 C 4 and phenylalanine in some AKR members. In the present study we prepared mutant enzymes of AKR 1 C 4 in which His- 216 was replaced with tyrosine or phenylalanine. The two mutations decreased 3 -fold the K(m) for NADP(+) and differently influenced the K(m) and k(cat) for substrates depending on their structures. The kinetic constants for bile acids with a 12 alpha-hydroxy group were decreased 1. 5 - 7 -fold and those for the other substrates were increased 1. 3 - 9 -fold. The mutation also yielded different changes in sensitivity to competitive inhibitors such as <b>hexoestrol</b> analogues, 17 beta-oestradiol, phenolphthalein and flufenamic acid and 3, 5, 3 ', 5 '-tetraiodothyropropionic acid analogues. Furthermore, the mutation decreased the stimulatory effects of the enzyme activity by sulphobromophthalein, clofibric acid and thyroxine, which increased the K(m) for the coenzyme and substrate of the mutant enzymes more highly {{than those of the}} wild-type enzyme. These results indicate the importance of this histidine residue in creating the cavity of the substrate-binding site of AKR 1 C 4 through the orientation of the nicotinamide ring of the coenzyme, as well as its involvement in the conformational change by binding non-essential activators...|$|E
40|$|Human liver dihydrodiol {{dehydrogenase}} (DD; EC 1. 3. 1. 20) {{exists in}} isoforms (DD 1, DD 2 and DD 4) composed of 323 amino acids. DD 1 and DD 2 share 98 % {{amino acid sequence}} identity, but show lower identities (approx. 83 %) with DD 4, in which a marked difference {{is seen in the}} C-terminal ten amino acids. DD 4 exhibits unique catalytic properties, such as the ability to oxidize both (R) - and (S) -alicyclic alcohols equally, high dehydrogenase activity for bile acids, potent inhibition by steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and activation by sulphobromophthalein and clofibric acid derivatives. In this study, we have prepared chimaeric enzymes, in which we exchanged the C-terminal 39 residues between the two enzymes. Compared with DD 1, CDD 1 - 4 (DD 1 with the C-terminal sequence of DD 4) had increased kcat/Km values for 3 alpha-hydroxy- 5 beta-androstanes and bile acids of 3 - 9 -fold and decreased values for the other substrates by 5 - 100 -fold. It also became highly sensitive to DD 4 inhibitors such as phenolphthalein and <b>hexoestrol.</b> Another chimaeric enzyme, CDD 4 - 1 (DD 4 with the C-terminal sequence of DD 1), showed the same (S) -stereospecificity for the alicyclic alcohols as DD 1, had decreased kcat/Km values for bile acids with 7 beta- or 12 alpha-hydroxy groups by more than 120 -fold and was resistant to inhibition by betamethasone. In addition, the activation effects of sulphobromophthalein and bezafibrate decreased or disappeared for CDD 4 - 1. The recombinant DD 4 with the His 314 [...] >Pro (the corresponding residue of DD 1) mutation showed intermediate changes in the properties between those of wild-type DD 4 and CDD 4 - 1. The results indicate that the binding of substrates, inhibitors and activators to the enzymes is controlled by residues in their C-terminal domains; multiple residues co-ordinately act as determinants for substrate specificity and inhibitor sensitivity...|$|E
