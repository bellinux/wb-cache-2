5|$|Look, I'm sorry you're dead OK? I do care. But to be {{perfectly}} honest with you, I don't care a lot. You had a choice, you took the drugs, you died. Are you seriously claiming no one warned you <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>dangerous?...</b> I mean, have you had a look at the world lately?... There's plenty of stuff going on that kills you and you don't get warned at all. So sticking your head in a crocodile you were told about is not calculated to get my sympathy.|$|E
5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of war in September 1939, Bessie left her union post and joined G Division of the Liverpool Ambulance Service, as a driver. Initially her main job was to train other drivers, mostly young women. She became a section leader and then a deputy leader of G Division, an administrative post that should have kept her at headquarters. However, she records that she drove her ambulance through all the 68 major air raids that struck Liverpool during the war years. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>dangerous</b> work; on a single day, 3May 1941, 14 drivers lost their lives. Bessie remained with the ambulance service almost {{until the end of}} the war in 1945.|$|E
5|$|Rousseau was {{enthusiastic}} and sent his cycling editor, Victor Breyer, {{to find a}} route. Breyer travelled to Amiens in a Panhard driven by his colleague, Paul Meyan. The following morning Breyer— later deputy organiser of the Tour de France and a leading official of the Union Cycliste Internationale - continued by bike. The wind blew, the rain fell and the temperature dropped. Breyer reached Roubaix filthy and exhausted {{after a day of}} riding on cobbles (setts). He swore he would send a telegram to Minart urging him to drop the idea, saying <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>dangerous</b> to send a race the way he had just ridden. But that evening a meal and drinks with the team from Roubaix changed his mind.|$|E

5|$|The Natives {{remained}} in London following the England international. They defeated London Welsh on 18 February, before losing first to Cambridge, then Oxford University. From there they travelled north and won two matches before losing to Leigh. After {{a win over}} Runcorn, there was a defeat to Oldham, played on a ground Eyton said was so frozen <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>dangerous.</b> After reversing their previous loss to Halifax with a 6–0 win, the Natives suffered a loss to Barrow and District on 7 March. The New Zealanders then had a run of seven straight wins before a 1–1 draw with Hull. Widnes were then defeated {{for the second time}} in two weeks in the tourists' last match in northern England.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft's ideas became {{associated}} {{with her life}} story and women writers felt that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>dangerous</b> to mention her in their texts. Hays, who had previously been a close friend and an outspoken advocate for Wollstonecraft and her Rights of Woman, for example, did not include her {{in the collection of}} Illustrious and Celebrated Women she published in 1803. Maria Edgeworth specifically distances herself from Wollstonecraft in her novel Belinda (1802); she caricatures Wollstonecraft as a radical feminist in the character of Harriet Freke. But, like Jane Austen, she does not reject Wollstonecraft's ideas. Both Edgeworth and Austen argue that women are crucial {{to the development of the}} nation; moreover, they portray women as rational beings who should choose companionate marriage.|$|E
5|$|The power Sejanus {{attained}} in {{his capacity}} as prefect proved Maecenas right in his prediction to Augustus, that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>dangerous</b> to allow one man to command the guard. Cassius Dio notes that after Sejanus, no other prefect except Gaius Fulvius Plautianus, who commanded the Guard under Septimius Severus, would rise to such influence. Following his death, the Guard began to play an increasingly ambitious and bloody role in the Empire. They assassinated emperors, bullied their prefects or turned on the people of Rome. In AD 41 Caligula was killed by conspirators from the senatorial class and from the Guard. The Praetorians placed Claudius on the throne, daring the Senate to oppose their decision. In the late 1st century, a calculated uprising of Praetorians against Emperor Nerva, led by Casperius Aelianus, forced Nerva to adopt the more popular Trajan as his son and successor.|$|E

5|$|Van Peebles {{and several}} key crew members were armed because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>dangerous</b> {{to attempt to}} create a film without the support of the union. One day, Van Peebles looked for his gun, and failed to find it. Van Peebles found out that someone had put it in the prop box. When they filmed the scene in which Beetle is interrogated by police, who fire a gun next to both of his ears, it was feared that the real gun would be picked up instead of the prop. While {{shooting}} a sequence with members of the Hells Angels, one of the bikers told Van Peebles they wanted to leave; Van Peebles responded by telling them they were paid to shoot until the scene was over. The biker took out a knife and started cleaning his fingernails with it. In response, Van Peebles snapped his fingers, and his crewmembers were standing there with rifles. The bikers stayed to shoot the scene.|$|E
5|$|The {{revolt of}} the Batavi {{appears to have}} led to a {{significant}} change in the Roman government's policy on deployment of Auxilia. The revolt proved that in times of civil strife, when legions were far from their bases campaigning for rival claimants to the imperial throne, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>dangerous</b> to leave provinces exclusively in the hands of auxiliary regiments recruited from the indigenous nation. During the Julio-Claudian period, auxiliary regiments had often been deployed away from their original home province. But in the Flavian period (69–96), this appears to have become standard policy. Thus in AD 70, 5 reconstituted Batavi regiments (one ala and four cohortes) were transferred to Britain under Petillius Cerialis, who had suppressed the Civilis revolt and then embarked on the governorship of the island. The great majority of regiments probably founded in the 1st century were stationed away from their province of origin in the second e.g. of 13 British regiments recorded in the mid-2nd century, none were stationed in Britain. Furthermore, it appears that in the Flavian era native noblemen were no longer permitted to command auxiliary units from their own tribe.|$|E

25|$|Madero's {{candidacy}} against Díaz garnered {{widespread support}} in Mexico, {{since he was}} someone of independent financial means, ideological determination, and bravery to oppose Díaz when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>dangerous</b> to do so. Arrested by the dictatorship shortly after being declared Presidential candidate by his party, the opposition leader escaped from prison and launched the Plan of San Luis Potosí from the United States, in this manner beginning the Mexican Revolution.|$|E
25|$|After the Vorticists' only U.K. {{exhibition}} in 1915, the movement broke up, {{largely as a}} result of World War I, though Lewis's patron, John Quinn, organised a Vorticist exhibition at the Penguin Club in New York in 1917. Lewis was posted to the western front, and served as a second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery. Much of his time was spent in Forward Observation Posts looking down at apparently deserted German lines, registering targets and calling down fire from batteries massed around the rim of the Ypres Salient. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>dangerous</b> work and he made vivid accounts of narrow misses and deadly artillery duels. After the Third Battle of Ypres in 1917, he was appointed as an official war artist for both the Canadian and British governments, beginning work in December 1917.|$|E
25|$|A {{visit to}} the {{workshops}} always makes a deep impression. At the forges hirsute men, stripped to the waist, move rapidly and methodically {{in front of the}} ovens. The bars of iron, heated to an exact temperature, are swallowed by the presses and moulded into the desired shape in a second. The rough form of a shell, glowing bright red, and carrying on its flank the first identification marks, is then rolled towards the yard, like a beautiful but terrible toy, a friend of the graves. As soon as the shell has cooled enough, skilful hands take it, smooth and polish it, and finish it to perfection. But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>dangerous</b> work, and the hospital had a steady stream of ‘work-wounded’ to deal with, some minor, some much more serious. As an example, here is part of the story of one man.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, the two {{disagreed}} {{about the}} extent to which the deepest elements of Chassidic wisdom should be taught openly. Rabbi Dovber, in his magnum opus Sha'ar HaYichud (The Gate of Unity), explains the entire spiritual superstructure of creation. Rabbi Aharon, on the other hand, argued that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>dangerous</b> to discuss certain aspects of creation because it could lead a person to inadvertently view God anthropomorphically. Therefore, it is merely enough for a person to know that God is so great that His Existence precludes the existence of any created beings, but that created beings exist, nonetheless. This very paradox is a testimony to the greatness of God. While Rabbi Aharon's teachings involve some of the deepest aspects of Kabbalistic wisdom, they nonetheless entreat the reader to use the deep intellectual wisdom of Kabbala in order to inspire simple love and fear for God. This was the foundation of Rabbi Dovber's doctrine as well, and in fact a cornerstone in Rabbi Shneur Zalman's own Tanya. The difference lay primarily in the outer (Chitzonius) emotional conduct Rabbi Aharon expected of his followers, and the intense manifestation of self-effacement Rabbi Dovber expected of his.|$|E
25|$|Sugihara had {{cooperated with}} Polish {{intelligence}} {{as part of}} a bigger Japanese–Polish cooperative plan. As the Soviet Union occupied sovereign Lithuania in 1940, many Jewish refugees from Poland (Polish Jews) as well as Lithuanian Jews tried to acquire exit visas. Without the visas, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>dangerous</b> to travel, yet it was impossible to find countries willing to issue them. Hundreds of refugees came to the Japanese consulate in Kaunas, trying to get a visa to Japan. At the time, on the brink of the war, Lithuanian Jews made up one third of Lithuania's urban population and half of the residents of every town as well. The Dutch consul Jan Zwartendijk had provided some of them with an official third destination to Curaçao, a Caribbean island and Dutch colony that required no entry visa, or Surinam (which, upon independence in 1975, became Suriname). At the time, the Japanese government required that visas be issued only to those who had gone through appropriate immigration procedures and had enough funds. Most of the refugees did not fulfill these criteria. Sugihara dutifully contacted the Japanese Foreign Ministry three times for instructions. Each time, the Ministry responded that anybody granted a visa should have a visa to a third destination to exit Japan, with no exceptions.|$|E
25|$|However, {{just when}} {{it looked as if}} the new gun was about to become a great success, a great deal of {{opposition}} to the gun arose, both inside the army and from rival arms manufacturers, particularly Joseph Whitworth of Manchester. Stories were publicised that the new gun was too difficult to use, that it was too expensive, that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>dangerous</b> to use, that it frequently needed repair and so on. All of this smacked of a concerted campaign against Armstrong. Armstrong was able to refute all of these claims in front of various government committees, but he found the constant criticism very wearying and depressing. In 1862 the government decided to stop ordering the new gun and return to muzzle loaders. Also, because of a drop in demand, future orders for guns would be supplied from Woolwich, leaving Elswick without new business. Compensation was eventually agreed with the government for the loss of business to the company. The government would not release the company from its agreement not to sell armaments abroad, so that avenue was closed to it. Eventually, the restriction was relaxed, and the company was able to sell guns to both sides in the American Civil War.|$|E
