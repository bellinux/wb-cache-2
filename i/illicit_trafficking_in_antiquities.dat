40|$|Diversified {{transnational}} {{criminal activities}} coupled with broader geographic capabili-ties {{have turned the}} black and white line between the licit “upperworld ” and the illicit underworld a murky shade of grey, and the illicit antiquities trade is no exception. This article highlights criminal dynamics of <b>trafficking</b> <b>in</b> looted <b>antiquities</b> from the perspec-tive of the source end of the problem—that is, theft of antiquities from archaeological sites and their <b>illicit</b> export. <b>Trafficking</b> <b>in</b> <b>antiquities</b> is a crime of transnational propor-tions because it involves the illegal removal and export of cultural material from source countries, which supplies the demand generated from developed, rich, market economies...|$|R
40|$|This book {{examines}} {{the problem of}} the <b>illicit</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>in</b> looted <b>antiquities.</b> One component analyses the current legal structure governing the international movement of looted antiquities. This, it is concluded, is not the most effective method available to control the problem. Flaws in the current system of laws are examined, both in terms of their ex facie loopholes, and in terms of their broader lack of 'fit' with the market they seek to govern. The second part of the book uses qualitative interview and observational data gathered from meetings with key market figures, and site visits, to construct a scheme for understanding how buyers <b>in</b> the <b>antiquities</b> market make their purchasing choices. This scheme is used to recommend a regulatory structure which would better control the market. The two parts of the study [...] the legal analysis and the interview data [...] are woven together throughout, so as to answer most effectively the questions 'what is wrong with the antiquities market?' and 'what can we do about it?...|$|R
