An additional 17inches (43cm) of snow were dumped on Cleveland, Ohio that day, filling the streets with snowdrifts 6feet (2m) high. Streetcar operators stayed with their stranded, powerless vehicles <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>nights,</b> eating whatever food was provided by local residents. Travelers were forced to take shelter and wait for things to clear.|$|E

He arrived at Second Army Headquarters where he was briefed on the situation, then went to 2nd Division's advanced headquarters, where he met Brigadier General Hasan Abu Sa'ada and visited the frontline troops. Many of the soldiers had not slept <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>nights,</b> but the successful crossing was a morale booster, a tonic as he described it.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} in Vancouver, British Columbia. The neighborhood scenes were shot in a cul-de-sac of million-dollar homes, and production housed the residents in hotels <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>nights</b> to allow for filming. Although the sequence of Sam and Dean looking across the street as the grandfather is killed appears to be shot from {{inside one of the}} houses, the actors were actually standing on a two-story scaffolding across the street, looking through fake windows. Shots of them inside the house in the same scene made use of one of the basements.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after Uncle Tupelo's signing, Giant Records {{changed its}} name to Rockville Records. The band's first album for Rockville No Depression, was {{recorded}} over ten days in January 1990, at Fort Apache South recording studio in Boston, Massachusetts. The album's thematic structure revolved around their lives as adolescents in Belleville; examples are songs about wanting to avoid factory work and songs about fearing a potential Persian Gulf War military draft. Impressed by their previous work on Dinosaur Jr.'s Bug, the band wanted Paul Kolderie and Sean Slade to produce the album. Slade let Farrar play on the same 1961 Gibson Les Paul SG Junior that J. Mascis originally played on Bug. The album was released on June 21, 1990, and the band celebrated by playing at Cicero's <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>nights.</b>|$|E
5|$|This too {{was intercepted}} and photographed but, {{as it was}} a {{relatively}} harmless letter, it was forwarded on while the British authorities continued to monitor Lody's communications in the hope of finding out more about the German espionage network. The day after sending it, on 15 September, Lody travelled to London to reconnoitre the city's war preparations. Travelling light, he stayed <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>nights</b> at the Ivanhoe Hotel in Bloomsbury (now the Bloomsbury Street Hotel) and set to work finding information about the security measures at public buildings. He said later that he had not actually observed the buildings himself but had obtained cuttings from newspapers, which he intended to send to Berlin. He also wrote a report on 16 September, but claimed that he had never sent it– it was never found by the British– as he felt that it was poorly written.|$|E

Funded by Lord Harlech and the actor Stanley Baker (amongst others) it {{attracted}} 30,000 people to the venue, held at the nearby Tupholme Abbey ruins. Amongst the artistes playing were Roxy Music and Status Quo and, <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>nights</b> running, the Rory Gallagher Band. Despite its popularity the show lost money due mainly to bad weather which blighted the event.|$|E
25|$|In April 2004, Petula Clark reprised {{her role}} as Norma {{opposite}} Michael Ball in a concert production of the show that ran <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>nights</b> at the Cork Opera House in Ireland, which was later broadcast on BBC Radio 2. The cast also included Michael Bauer (Max), Emma Williams (Betty), Michael Xavier (Artie) and the BBC Concert Orchestra was conducted by Martin Yates.

25|$|In 1942, Strauss {{moved with}} his family back to Vienna, where Alice and her {{children}} could be protected by Baldur von Schirach, the Gauleiter of Vienna. However, Strauss was unable to protect his Jewish relatives completely; in early 1944, while Strauss was away, Alice and his son Franz were abducted by the Gestapo and imprisoned <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>nights.</b> Strauss's personal intervention at this point saved them, {{and he was able}} to take them back to Garmisch, where the two remained under house arrest until the end of the war.|$|E
50|$|Looking back, the APO members Danny Javier and Boboy Garrovillo do not regret {{never having}} been regular wage earners. Their {{farewell}} concert, which had SRO audiences <b>for</b> <b>two</b> stormy <b>nights,</b> not unexpectedly became a hit record the following year.|$|R
60|$|<b>For</b> <b>two</b> weary <b>nights</b> {{and days}} the Mare had been {{employed}} thus, but as yet without {{a shadow of}} success. Foy and Martin sat in the boat staring at each other gloomily; indeed Foy's face was piteous to see.|$|R

25|$|The Cairngorm Plateau Disaster {{occurred}} in November 1971 when six fifteen-year-old Edinburgh {{school students and}} their two leaders were on a navigational expedition in a remote area of the Scottish mountains. When the weather deteriorated they adopted their emergency plan {{and headed for the}} Curran shelter, but they failed to reach it and became stranded <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>nights</b> on the high plateau in a blizzard. Five children and the leader's assistant died of exposure. A sixth student and the group's leader survived the ordeal with severe hypothermia and frostbite. The tragedy, also often called the Feith Buidhe Disaster, is regarded as Britain's worst mountaineering accident.|$|E
25|$|For example, on 14 July 1995, prisoners from Bratunac were bussed northward to {{a school}} {{in the village of}} Pilica, north of Zvornik. As at other {{detention}} facilities, there was no food or water and several men died in the school gym from heat and dehydration. The men were held at the Pilica school <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>nights.</b> On 16 July 1995, following a now familiar pattern, the men were called out of the school and loaded onto buses with their hands tied behind their backs. They were then driven to the Branjevo Military Farm, where groups of 10 were lined up and shot systematically.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Claus Wedekind {{found that}} {{in a group of}} female college {{students}} who smelled T-shirts worn by male students <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>nights</b> (without deodorant, cologne, or scented soaps), by far most women chose shirts worn by men of dissimilar MHCs, a preference reversed if the women were on oral contraceptives. Results of a 2002 experiment likewise suggest HLA-associated odors influence odor preference and may mediate social cues. In 2005 in a group of 58 subjects, women were more indecisive when presented with MHCs like their own, although with oral contraceptives, the women showed no particular preference. No studies show the extent to which odor preference determines mate selection (or vice versa).|$|E

25|$|Majeski {{was named}} one of the seven finalists for the inaugural Alan Kulwicki Driver Development Program in 2015. Participants were awarded $7777 to help develop their careers. He raced a similar {{schedule}} in 2015, starting with a seven-night series at New Smyrna Speedway for the World Series of Asphalt Stock Car Racing. Majeski won the second program on Tuesday night and lead the series points <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>nights.</b> In July 2015, Speed51.com had ranked him #4 on their short track power ranking with seven victories. At the Slinger Nationals, Majeski started 20th and passed up to second place. While battling for the lead {{near the end of the}} race, he got into an incident while trying to pass a lapped car and restarted at the back of the lead lap cars to finish fourth.|$|E
25|$|To {{ensure the}} pCas9cr4 plasmid was first {{successfully}} {{admitted to the}} cells, the cells were grown on a plate containing chloramphenicol; the pCas9cr4 plasmid contained the gene cmr, conferring resistance to chloramphenicol, which ensured only the successful recombinants grew. Triplicate plates of 10μL of recovered cultures as well as dilutions of 10−1, 10−2, and 10−3 were then spotted and incubated overnight at 30°C and CFU, or colony forming unit, assessments were then made to identify successful mutants using the miniaturized plating method described previously. Once the mutation of interest was screened using overnight growth on M9 minimal medium plates supplemented with glycerol, chloroacetate and SOC (super optimal broth with catabolite repression), colonies were patched onto selective plates using a toothpick and incubated at 30°C <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>nights.</b> After sufficient colony growth, cells were transfected with the pKDsg-XXX plasmid containing the aada gene, {{and as a result}} were resistant to the aminoglycosides spectinomycin and streptomycin. To ensure that the pKDsg-XXX plasmid was successfully admitted to the cells, the cells were grown on a plate containing both chloramphenicol and spectinomycin to select for cells containing both the pCas9cr4 and pKDsg-XXX plasmids.|$|E
25|$|Amid {{political}} controversy, in April 2007 the Government of Estonia started final {{preparations for}} the relocation of the statue and reburial of the associated remains, according to the political mandate received from the previous elections (held in March 2007). Disagreement over {{the appropriateness of the}} action led to mass protests and riots (accompanied by looting), lasting <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>nights,</b> the worst in Estonia since the Soviet reoccupation in 1944. During the riots, one Russian rioter was killed. In {{the early morning hours of}} April 27, 2007, after the first night's rioting, the Government of Estonia decided, at an emergency meeting, to relocate the monument immediately, referring to security concerns. By the following afternoon the stone structure had been dismantled as well. As of the afternoon of April 30, the statue without the stone structure had been placed at the Cemetery of the Estonian Defence Forces in Tallinn. An opening ceremony for the relocated statue was held on May 8, VE Day. (Soviet Army veterans celebrate Victory Day a day later, on May 9.) During June 2007 the stone structure was rebuilt. Relatives have made claims to bodies of four of the war dead. Unclaimed remains were reburied at the military cemetery, next to the relocated monument, on July 3, 2007.|$|E
