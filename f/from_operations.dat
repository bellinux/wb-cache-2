5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1945 several hundred {{veterans}} of the battle were detached <b>from</b> <b>operations</b> in Norway and returned to Arnhem {{to take part in}} filming for the war movie Theirs Is the Glory. While there they attended the first commemorative event at the cemetery. This event continued every year, and was attended by veterans, local residents and over 1000 school children who laid flowers on the graves of the dead. After the 25th anniversary in 1969, the Parachute Regiment approached Dutch organisers to suggest ending the ceremony, believing the battle to have passed sufficiently into history. The Dutch were vehemently and emotionally opposed to the idea and thus the ceremony continues to be held annually.|$|E
5|$|Late in 1384 Carrouges entered {{society for}} the first time since his {{marriage}} four years earlier, attending a party to celebrate the birth of a neighbour's son. Carrouges and Le Gris met at the celebration and agreed to end their quarrel, Carrouges introducing Le Gris to his wife Marguerite {{for the first time}}. A few months after this meeting, in March 1385, Carrouges attempted to increase his family wealth through military means, by joining the army of Jean de Vienne for an expedition sailing to Edinburgh. This force of about 3,000 soldiers was intended to unite with the Scottish army and raid Northern England, distracting English forces <b>from</b> <b>operations</b> in France. Traveling with men-at-arms, horses, gold and equipment, Carrouges and his entourage rode to Sluys and took ship to Leith during the spring of 1385.|$|E
5|$|On 1December 1943, Squadron Leader R.E. Bell {{took over}} command of No.4 OTU on a {{temporary}} basis, handing over to Flight Lieutenant R.Tuel-Wilkinson on 27April 1944.

No.4 OTU disbanded on 30April 1944; a small detachment remained {{to hand over the}} Williamtown base to an advance party of No.5 Operational Training Unit the following day. The rest of No.5 OTU transferred from Tocumwal to Williamtown during July. By the time No.4 OTU disbanded, the school's Vengeances had accumulated 7,593 flying hours and the Wirraways 7,646 hours.|$|E

5|$|Until a road {{could be}} opened from Lae, the Kaiapit area {{could only be}} {{supplied}} by air {{and there were a}} limited number of transport aircraft. Even flying in an airborne engineer aviation battalion to improve the airstrip would have involved taking aircraft away <b>from</b> <b>operations</b> supporting the 7th Division at Nadzab. Moreover, Whitehead warned that he could not guarantee adequate air support for both Kaiapit and the upcoming Finschhafen operation at the same time. However, Herring calculated that the 7th Division had sufficient reserves at Nadzab to allow maintenance flights to be suspended for a week or so after the capture of Kaiapit. He planned to seize Kaiapit with an overland advance from Nadzab by independent companies, the Papuan Infantry Battalion, and the 7th Division's 21st Infantry Brigade.|$|E
5|$|Between 17 and 20 July 1914, the King George Vs {{took part}} in a test {{mobilisation}} and fleet review as part of the British response to the July Crisis. Afterwards, they were ordered to proceed {{with the rest of the}} Home Fleet to Scapa Flow to safeguard the fleet from a possible surprise attack by the Imperial German Navy. After the British declaration of war on Germany on 4 August, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet, and placed under the command of Admiral Jellicoe. According to pre-war doctrine, the role of the Grand Fleet was to fight a decisive battle against the German High Seas Fleet. This grand battle was slow to happen, however, because of the Germans' reluctance to commit their battleships against the superior British force. As a result, the Grand Fleet spent its time training in the North Sea, punctuated by the occasional mission to intercept a German raid or major fleet sortie. While the 2nd Battle Squadron was conducting gunnery training off the northern coast of Ireland on 27 October, Audacious struck a mine and sank; all of her crew was successfully rescued before she capsized. King George V developed problems with her condensers in November. This forced the ship to be intermittently withdrawn <b>from</b> <b>operations</b> over the next several months while the condensers had their tubes replaced.|$|E
5|$|During the journey, Pattle {{developed}} a fever and high temperature. Nevertheless, on 19 April {{he took to}} the skies in several missions. By this date, Pattle's fever had metamorphosed into influenza and his condition had worsened. He did not want his squadron {{to know he was}} unwell. Pattle feared the effect it would have on morale and vowed to continue flying. The officer commanding No. 80 Squadron, Tap Jones, visited Pattle the day before and noticed he was very gaunt, drawn and that he had lost weight. Jones helped the weakened Pattle change into his flying gear. Jones was acting wing commander, but did not ban Pattle <b>from</b> <b>operations.</b> Pattle claimed six victories this day — three Ju 88s and three Bf 109s — plus one Henschel Hs 126 shared and two probables (a Ju 88 and a Bf 109). The battle with the Bf 109s took place over Eleusis and Tanagra airfields. He engaged III./Jagdgeschwader 77 (Fighter Wing 77 or JG 77) in a head-on position and executed an Immelmann turn which took him behind and above the Messerschmitts and allowed him to claim three of them shot down. No. 33 Squadron claimed four Bf 109s (three were lost). Among the victims was the German ace, Kurt Ubben. Ubben landed in Allied territory and was picked up by a Fieseler Fi 156, escaping to his own lines.|$|E

5|$|In early 1944 No.73 Wing was {{selected}} to support the US Army's Admiralty Islands campaign. The 1st Cavalry Division began {{to land on the}} islands on 29February, and the wing moved to Momote Airstrip on Los Negros Island in March 1944. No.79 Squadron became operational there with 24 aircraft on the 29th of the month. From Momote, the squadron flew ground attack sorties in support of US troops until Japanese resistance ceased. No Japanese aircraft were encountered throughout this operation. By the end of April, No.79 Squadron's main role was to escort Allied shipping, though flying was hampered by a shortage of spare parts. The squadron's commanding officer, Squadron Leader M.S. Bott, was killed in an accident on 16April. Shipping escort patrols continued in May, but difficulties maintaining the Spitfires reduced the squadron to just two operational aircraft with another 12 awaiting repair. Due to a shortage of aircraft the squadron's flying activities were limited to training sorties between August and October, and aircraft availability continued to be a problem until late November. On 9November, two Spitfires unsuccessfully attempted to intercept three Japanese A6M fighters which had raided Hyane Harbour; while the Japanese force had been tracked by Allied radar for 25 minutes prior to the attack, the Spitfires were scrambled only after the raiders had left the area. No.79 Squadron subsequently maintained a three-aircraft patrol over Los Negros during daylight hours until 22November. Two days later the squadron was released <b>from</b> <b>operations</b> ahead of moving to Darwin in northern Australia to be re-equipped with more modern Mark VIII Spitfires.|$|E
5|$|Jaguars were {{successfully}} {{sold to a}} number of overseas countries, India being the most prolific operator. The Jaguar International was an export version which was sold to Ecuador, Nigeria and Oman. The Ecuadorian Air Force, the only Latin American export customer, purchased 10 single- and 2 two-seat variants, officially designated Jaguars ES and EB, respectively. The first of twelve aircraft arrived in January 1977. They were used mainly for ground attack roles and occasionally for air superiority duties during the Cenepa War with Peru in 1995, but {{the main part of the}} fleet was held in reserve in case of a wider conflict with the Peruvians. Nigeria ordered 13 single-seat SN and 5 two-seat BN variants; SEPECAT delivered the first of these in May 1984. A subsequent order for an 18-aircraft second batch was cancelled. Some of those in service were withdrawn <b>from</b> <b>operations</b> on the grounds of economy, with the remaining aircraft put up for re-sale. The Royal Air Force of Oman, like Ecuador, ordered 10 single-seat and 2 two-seat variants, designated Jaguars OS and OB, respectively; the first was delivered in March 1977. A second identical 12-aircraft order was placed in the mid-1980s; these were joined by two ex-IAF and ex-RAF examples. The last of the Omani aircraft were retired on 6 August 2014.|$|E
