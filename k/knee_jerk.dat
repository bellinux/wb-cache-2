A 64 -year-old woman who experienced hallucinations was treated with perospirone (8 mg/day). She also complained of depressed mood and was prescribed paroxetine (10 mg/day). She exhibited finger tremors, sweating, coarse shivering, hyperactive <b>knee</b> <b>jerks,</b> vomiting, diarrhea, tachycardia, and psychomotor agitation. After the discontinuation of paroxetine and perospirone, the symptoms disappeared. Another 81 -year-old woman, who experienced delusions, was treated with perospirone (8 mg/day). Depressive symptoms appeared and paroxetine (10 mg/day) was added. She exhibited tachycardia, finger tremors, anxiety, agitation, and hyperactive <b>knee</b> <b>jerks.</b> The symptoms disappeared after the cessation of paroxetine and perospirone. Recently, the effectiveness of coadministrating 5 -HT 1 A agonistic psychotropics with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has been reported, and SSRIs with 5 -HT 1 A agonistic activity have been newly approved {{in the treatment of}} depression. Perospirone is a serotonin–dopamine antagonist and agonistic on the 5 -HT 1 A receptors. Animal studies have indicated that mild serotonin excess induces low body temperature through 5 -HT 1 A, whereas severe serotonin excess induces high body temperature through 5 -HT 2 A activation. Therefore, it could be hypothesized that mild serotonin excess induces side effects through 5 -HT 1 A, and severe serotonin excess induces lethal side effects with hyperthermia through 5 -HT 2 A. Serotonin toxicity via a low dose of paroxetine that is coadministered with perospirone, which acts agonistically on the 5 -HT 1 A receptor and antagonistically on the 5 -HT 2 A receptor, clearly indicated 5 -HT 1 A receptor involvement in mild serotonin toxicity. Careful measures should be adopted to avoid serotonin toxicity following the combined use of SSRIs and 5 -HT 1 A agonists.

40|$|Autosomal {{recessive}} cerebellar ataxias are {{a heterogeneous}} group of neurological disorders. In 1981, a neurological entity comprised by early onset progressive cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria, pyramidal {{weakness of the}} limbs and retained or increased upper limb reflexes and <b>knee</b> <b>jerks</b> was described. This disorder is known as early onset cerebellar ataxia with retained tendon reflexes. In this article, we aimed to call attention for the diagnosis of early onset cerebellar ataxia with retained tendon reflexes as {{the second most common}} cause of autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias, after Friedreich ataxia, and also to perform a clinical spectrum study of this syndrome. In this data, 12 patients from different families met all clinical features for early onset cerebellar ataxia with retained tendon reflexes. Dysarthria and cerebellar atrophy were the most common features in our sample. It is uncertain, however, whether early onset cerebellar ataxia with retained tendon reflexes is a homogeneous disease or a group of phenotypically similar syndromes represented by different genetic entities.

40|$|The {{label of}} "early-onset {{cerebellar}} ataxia with retained tendon reflexes" (EOCA) {{has been created}} to differentiate it from Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) patients with preserved <b>knee</b> <b>jerks</b> and absence of cardiomyopathy, optic atrophy, and diabetes mellitus. However, EOCA is a heterogeneous syndrome and several FRDA patients present with an EOCA-like phenotype. Cerebellar ataxia with hypogonadism is another heterogeneous syndrome for which no locus has been mapped yet. Two peculiar ataxic syndromes {{have been identified in}} genetically isolated populations: autosomal recessive ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS) in Quebec and infantile-onset spinocerebellar ataxia (IOSCA) in Finland. Both conditions present usually within the second year of life. ARSACS is characterized by marked spasticity and IOSCA by a complex phenotype which includes, besides ataxia, epilepsy, optic atrophy, ophthalmoplegia, hearing loss, and areflexia. The responsible genes are SACS, encoding sacsin, a protein which may act as a chaperone, and C 10 orf 2, encoding Twinkle, a mitochondrial DNA-specific helicase. Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome, clinically characterized by cerebellar ataxia, cataracts, myopathy, and mental retardation, is genetically heterogeneous. One gene, SIL 1, encodes a nucleotide exchange factor for the heat-shock protein 70 chaperone HSPA 5.
