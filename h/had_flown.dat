5|$|By 24 December 1965, 170 U.S. {{aircraft}} {{had been}} lost during the campaign (85 Air Force, 94 Navy, and one Marine Corps). Eight VNAF aircraft had also been lost. Air force aircrews <b>had</b> <b>flown</b> 25,971 sorties and dropped 32,063 tons of bombs. Naval aviators <b>had</b> <b>flown</b> 28,168 sorties and dropped 11,144 tons. The VNAF had contributed 682 missions with unknown ordnance tonnages.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{helicopters}} destroyed or damaged during the operation shocked {{the proponents of}} U.S. Army aviation and prompted a reevaluation of basic airmobile doctrine. The 101st Airborne Division alone, for example, had 84 of its aircraft destroyed and another 430 damaged. Combined U.S./ARVN helicopter losses totaled 168 destroyed and 618 damaged. During Lam Son 719 American helicopters <b>had</b> <b>flown</b> more than 160,000 sorties and 19 U.S. Army aviators had been killed, 59 were wounded, and 11 were missing at its conclusion. South Vietnamese helicopters <b>had</b> <b>flown</b> an additional 5,500 missions. U.S. Air Force tactical aircraft <b>had</b> <b>flown</b> more than 8,000 sorties during the incursion and had dropped 20,000 tons of bombs and napalm. B-52 bombers <b>had</b> <b>flown</b> another 1,358 sorties and dropped 32,000 tons of ordnance. Seven U.S. fixed-wing aircraft were shot down over southern Laos: six from the Air Force (two dead/two missing) and one from the Navy (one aviator killed).|$|E
5|$|In August 1941, Sayn-Wittgenstein {{transferred}} to the night fighter force. By this time, he <b>had</b> <b>flown</b> 150combat missions and was awarded both classes of the Iron Cross, Honor Goblet of the Luftwaffe and the Front Flying Clasp of the Luftwaffe for Bomber crews in Gold.|$|E
50|$|General Cray {{holds the}} rating of Command Pilot. He <b>has</b> <b>flown</b> more than 2,500 hours. The {{aircraft}} he <b>has</b> <b>flown</b> include the F-16A/B/C/D, AT-38, T-38, and T-37.|$|R

50|$|Studied by Douglas Aircraft Company in 1965, this rocket {{consisted}} of a whole Saturn IB with 4 strap-on SRBs that <b>have</b> <b>flown</b> on the Titan 3E interplanetary missile carriers. All components of the vehicle <b>have</b> <b>flown,</b> but not together for this concept.|$|R
5|$|The Germans {{emphasised}} that al-Husayni <b>had</b> <b>flown</b> from Berlin to Sarajevo {{in order}} to bless and inspect the division. During his visit to Bosnia al-Husayni also convinced some important Muslim leaders that {{the formation of the}} division was in the interests of Islam.|$|E
5|$|Among those Chinese who {{did manage}} to escape Nanking were Chiang Kai-shek and his wife Soong Mei-ling, who <b>had</b> <b>flown</b> out of Nanking on a private plane just before {{the crack of dawn}} on December 7. The mayor of Nanking and most of the {{municipal}} government left the same day, entrusting management of the city to the Nanking Garrison Force.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Kennedy's proposal, only one American <b>had</b> <b>flown</b> in space—less than a month earlier—and NASA had not yet sent an {{astronaut}} into orbit. Even some NASA employees doubted whether Kennedy's ambitious goal could be met. By 1963, Kennedy even came close to agreeing to a joint US-USSR Moon mission, to eliminate duplication of effort.|$|E
50|$|Although several designs (such as the ConVairCar) <b>have</b> <b>flown,</b> none <b>have</b> enjoyed {{commercial}} success, {{and those}} that <b>have</b> <b>flown</b> are not widely known about by the general public. The most successful example, in that several were made and one is still flying, is the 1949 Taylor Aerocar.|$|R

5|$|By the {{conclusion}} of his combat tour in July 1942, Brennan <b>had</b> <b>flown</b> a total of twenty-two operational sorties and was credited with destroying 10 Axis aircraft over Malta, with one probably destroyed and a further 6 damaged. For his efforts {{in the destruction of}} Axis aircraft during this period, Brennan was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. The notification of the decoration was published in a supplement to the London Gazette on 6 October 1942.|$|E
5|$|Goddard had a weak {{heart and}} had never flown before, so he asked his doctor, William Kirkwood, to {{accompany}} him on the trip. As Kirkwood was a resident at a maternity hospital, his presence led to false speculation that Simpson was pregnant, and even {{that she was having}} an abortion. The press excitedly reported that the solicitor <b>had</b> <b>flown</b> to Simpson accompanied by a gynaecologist and an anaesthetist (who was actually the lawyer's clerk).|$|E
5|$|On 7 November, {{engineers}} {{determined that}} there was no additional work needed to verify the solid rocket boosters for flight, following discovery of small cracks in the hold-down posts attached to boosters that <b>had</b> <b>flown</b> earlier that year. Close inspections of the STS-74 stack determined that no such cracks were present on the boosters to be used for the mission.|$|E

5|$|On June 27, 2009, a {{crowd of}} over 2,000 made up of family, friends and well-wishers came to Pine Valley to {{celebrate}} Finn's 100th birthday.

5|$|One {{week after}} her victory, Ryan {{announced}} on her website that she <b>had</b> <b>flown</b> to New York {{to meet with}} representatives from a record label {{and some of the}} recording industry's top songwriters.

5|$|The {{accident}} {{aircraft was}} a four-engine de Havilland Canada DHC-7 Dash 7 Series 102, with serial number 28, built in 1980. It was bought used by Widerøe in 1985 and registered as LN-WFN on 8 November 1985. Its {{certificate of airworthiness}} was last renewed on 4 November 1987 and was valid until 30 November 1988. The aircraft had operated 16,934 hours and 32,347 cycles prior to its last flight. The last A-check took place on 15 April 1988, after which the aircraft <b>had</b> <b>flown</b> 147 hours and 30 cycles. The 58-year-old captain held a D-certificate issued 8 April 1981 and was last renewed on 11 December 1987. He took his initial license in 1949 and {{had worked as a}} pilot in Widerøe since 1 April 1960. At the time of his last renewal, he <b>had</b> <b>flown</b> 19,886 hours, of which 2,849 hours were with the Dash 7. He had completed periodical flight training with the Dash 7 on 8 March 1988. He had just come home from a six-week vacation in Spain.|$|E

5|$|The {{aircraft}} serving Flight 3054 was an Airbus A320-233, {{serial number}} 789, registration PR-MBK; it was powered by two IAE V2500-533 engines. It {{was built in}} 1998 and had been operated by several other airlines before entering service with TAM in February 2007. The aircraft was owned by Pegasus Aviation and <b>had</b> <b>flown</b> more than 21,000 hours over 10,000 cycles before the crash.|$|E
5|$|The four {{remaining}} North Korean pilots immediately {{retreated to}} the north. The aircraft likely staged at Pyongyang Air Base, and informed their superiors. No additional North Korean aircraft were spotted {{in the area for}} the rest of the day. By the end of the day the US aircraft from the three squadrons <b>had</b> <b>flown</b> 163 sorties.|$|E
5|$|A single Pe-3 was {{captured}} by the Finns when it {{had to make a}} forced landing in marshy ground near Lake Inari on 28 November 1942. It was relatively undamaged and was recovered, repaired and placed into service as 'PE-301'. It served with PLeLv 48 and was converted into a photo-reconnaissance aircraft in 1944 before being destroyed by a Soviet bombing raid on the airfield at Lappeenranta on 2 July 1944. By then, it <b>had</b> <b>flown</b> over 222 hours in Finnish service.|$|E

On 31 December 1967, the Department of Defense announced that 864,000 tons of American bombs {{had been dropped}} on North Vietnam during Rolling Thunder, compared with 653,000 tons dropped during the entire Korean War and 503,000 tons in the Pacific theater during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Both the Do 17s and Ju 88s of the III./KG 76 {{encountered}} flak as {{they crossed}} Dover. The Do 17s were escorted by ZG 26 while III./JG 51 led by Hannes Trautloft escorted the Ju 88s. The German bombers <b>had</b> <b>flown</b> east of Canterbury and thereby avoided the main concentration of fighters on the Canterbury-Margate line. At 13:01 they passed over Ashford and had a clear 65km (40 mile) run before they reached Biggin Hill and its four defending squadrons.|$|E
5|$|By 1962, {{both the}} United States and the Soviet Union <b>had</b> <b>flown</b> two solo spaceflights in the Space Race. There was a {{widespread}} perception, however, that the United States was falling behind; its two missions had been suborbital and had {{lasted only a}} few minutes. The Soviet missions had both orbited the Earth, and the second, Vostok 2, had remained in orbit for a full day. Using the new high-powered Atlas booster, the coming orbital Mercury missions were expected to reduce {{the gap between the}} two countries.|$|E
