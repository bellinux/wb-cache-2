5|$|Titanium {{can catch}} fire when a fresh, non-{{oxidized}} surface {{comes in contact}} with liquid oxygen. Fresh metal may be exposed when the oxidized surface is struck or scratched with a <b>hard</b> <b>object,</b> or when mechanical strain causes a crack. This poses a limitation to its use in liquid oxygen systems, {{such as those in}} the aerospace industry. Because titanium tubing impurities can cause fires when exposed to oxygen, titanium is prohibited in gaseous oxygen respiration systems. Steel tubing is used for high pressure systems (3,000 p.s.i.) and aluminium tubing for low pressure systems.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} in 1838 of another fighter, William Phelps, {{also known as}} Brighton Bill, in a match against Owen Swift, the London Prize Ring Rules were {{introduced}} by the Pugilists's Protective Association to more clearly define the range of fouls and to introduce certain safety measures. Butting, gouging, biting, scratching, kicking were all forbidden as {{was the use of}} stones or any <b>hard</b> <b>object</b> in the hand. Thirty-second breaks were introduced between rounds, {{at the end of which}} each fighter had to walk to the scratch unaided within 8seconds. The wearing of spiked boots was prohibited, and boxers who went to ground without being hit were disqualified. These rules still form the basis for the modern sport of boxing.|$|E
5|$|Like {{all other}} lemurs, Hadropithecus was endemic to Madagascar. Because it died out only {{recently}} {{and is only}} known from subfossil remains, it {{is considered to be}} a modern form of Malagasy lemur. It once ranged across the Central Plateau, South, and Southwest regions of Madagascar. Within its original range, there were few other lemurs to overlap its ecological niche, and it has been shown to be the only subfossil lemur to consume both C3 and C4 (or CAM) plants, an indication that it lived in more open habitats and had a varied diet. Its physiology and dentition suggest that it may have been much like the Gelada Baboon in locomotion and diet, acting as a manual grazer (picking grass with the hands) since its teeth were well-adapted for grinding either grass or seeds. Microwear patterns on its teeth, as well as its overly large molars, indicate it processed hard objects like nuts or seeds, making it a seed predator. More recent microwear analysis suggests differences between Gelada Baboons and Hadropithecus, indicating that this extinct lemur may not have been a grazer, but strictly a <b>hard</b> <b>object</b> processor.|$|E

25|$|The Bennett {{fracture}} is {{an oblique}} intraarticular metacarpal fracture dislocation, {{caused by an}} axial force directed against the partially flexed metacarpal. This type of compression along the metacarpal bone is often sustained when a person punches a <b>hard</b> <b>object,</b> such as the skull or tibia of an opponent, or a wall. It can also occur {{as a result of}} a fall onto the thumb. This is a common injury sustained from bike falls, as the thumb is generally extended while around the handle bars. It is also a common injury in car crashes, especially into fixed objects, from the driver holding the steering wheel during impact. The hand moves forward, while the steering wheel rim hyperextends the thumb.|$|E
25|$|Damages, such as cracks on solar modules, {{have been}} seen on several occasions, mostly on the Sun installation, where 12 solar modules have been damaged, {{as well as on}} Jupiter and Saturn installations. It was thought at first that the cause of the cracks was hitting modules several times with an {{extremely}} heavy metal object because they can take a capacity of 400 kg, and are extremely difficult to break. It was later discovered by chance from the nearby ferry security camera footage that the cracks were caused by 3500 kg pickup truck that ran over modules. After this damage City introduced 24 hours supervisor and surveillance cameras that monitor the Monument. In June 2009, a unidentified <b>hard</b> <b>object</b> smashed 4 modules, and on night of August 8, 2 more. Nevertheless, all broken modules have been replaced with new ones.|$|E
500|$|While wasp stings deter many {{potential}} predators, bee-eaters (in the bird family Meropidae) specialise in eating stinging insects, making aerial sallies from a perch to catch them, and removing the venom from the stinger by repeatedly brushing the prey firmly against a <b>hard</b> <b>object,</b> {{such as a}} twig. The honey buzzard attacks the nests of social hymenopterans, eating wasp larvae; {{it is the only}} known predator of the dangerous Asian giant hornet or [...] "yak-killer" [...] (Vespa mandarinia).

2500|$|The {{technique}} {{of using a}} <b>hard</b> <b>object</b> against a plucked string {{goes back to the}} [...] "diddley bow" [...] derived from a one-stringed African instrument. The [...] "diddley bow" [...] is believed {{to be one of the}} ancestors of the bottleneck style.

With the [...] "slack-key" [...] the Hawaiians found it easy to play a three-chord song by moving a piece of metal along the fretboard and began to play the instrument across the lap.

2500|$|While Pakimé pottery is {{inspired}} by pre-Hispanic pottery, {{it is not an}} exact copy. Unlike other parts of Mexico, the pottery tradition broke completely here sometime during the colonial period. The current residents do not consider themselves to be the descendents of the Casas Grandes culture nor do their traditions tie to it. No one before Quezada's generation was involved with pottery. This has allowed the potters to experiment and test the limits of form and design, unlike many other Mexican potters who are constrained by generations of tradition. However, Quezada's recreation is interesting because he recreated two of the basic potting techniques from the pre-Hispanic period, the coil and molding methods. The raw clay is dug with a pick and shovel in the rugged foothills outside the town. It is cleaned by soaking it in water until it can be poured through a sieve. White clay is a favorite to work with but many colors are used. A potter's wheel is not used. The bottom of the pot is molded and the upper part is created by the coil method. When the pot is dry, it is rubbed with a stone or other <b>hard</b> <b>object</b> to make it shine. This can take days. Pots are fired on the open ground using wood and manure for fuel. Paints are made with mineral pigments collected locally. The pigments are ground into a powder using a metate grinding stone, then mixed with clay to [...] make a milky fluid paint. Many use traditional colors such as red, white and earth tones, but brighter colors have also been used. Brushes are made from dog, cat and even human hair.|$|E
40|$|Morphology of the dentofacial {{complex of}} early hominins has figured {{prominently}} in the inference of their dietary adaptations. Recent theoretical analysis of craniofacial morphology of Australopithecus africanus proposes that skull form in this taxon represents adaptation to feeding on large, <b>hard</b> <b>objects.</b> A modern analog for this specific dietary specialization {{is provided by the}} West African sooty mangabey, Cercocebus atys. This species habitually feeds on the large, exceptionally hard nuts of Sacoglottis gabonensis, stereotypically crushing the seed casings using their premolars and molars. This type of behavior has been inferred for A. africanus based on mathematical stress analysis and aspects of dental wear and morphology. While postcanine megadontia, premolar enlargement and thick molar enamel characterize both A. africanus and C. atys, these features are not universally associated with durophagy among living anthropoids. Occlusal microwear analysis reveals complex microwear textures in C. atys unlike those observed in A. africanus, but more closely resembling textures observed in Paranthropus robustus. Since sooty mangabeys process <b>hard</b> <b>objects</b> {{in a manner similar to}} that proposed for A. africanus, yet do so without the craniofacial buttressing characteristic of this hominin, it follows that derived features of the australopith skull are sufficient but not necessary for the consumption of large, <b>hard</b> <b>objects.</b> The adaptive significance of australopith craniofacial morphology may instead be related to the toughness, rather than the hardness, of ingested foods...|$|R

40|$|The East African hominin Paranthropus boisei was {{characterized}} by a suite of craniodental features that have been widely interpreted as adaptations to a diet that consisted of <b>hard</b> <b>objects</b> that required powerful peak masticatory loads. These morphological adaptations represent the culmination of an evolutionary trend that began in earlier taxa such as Australopithecus afarensis, and presumably facilitated utilization of open habitats in the Plio-Pleistocene. Here, we use stable isotopes to show that P. boisei had a diet that was dominated by C 4 biomass such as grasses or sedges. Its diet included more C 4 biomass than any other hominin studied to date, including its congener Paranthropus robustus from South Africa. These results, coupled with recent evidence from dental microwear, may indicate that the remarkable craniodental morphology of this taxon represents an adaptation for processing large quantities of low-quality vegetation rather than <b>hard</b> <b>objects...</b>|$|R
