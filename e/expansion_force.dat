50|$|Previous 1st Brigades in the New Zealand Army have {{included}} a brigade in the Middle East and France, 1916-19, a home defence formation active during the Second World War (part of the North Island home defence 1st Division), and a 1 Brigade / Integrated <b>Expansion</b> <b>Force</b> formed to direct three Territorial Force-formed battalions in the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E
50|$|The New Zealand Division was disbanded in 1961, as {{succeeding}} governments {{reduced the}} force, first to two brigades, {{and then a}} single one. This one-brigade force became, in the 1980s, the Integrated <b>Expansion</b> <b>Force,</b> to be formed by producing three composite battalions from the six Territorial Force infantry regiments.

30|$|A {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) mesh {{model of}} the cranium with associated maxillary sutures was developed using computed tomography (CT) images and Mimics modeling software. To compare transverse expansion stresses in rapid palatal expansion (RPE) and MARPE, <b>expansion</b> <b>forces</b> were distributed to differing points on the maxilla and evaluated with ANSYS simulation software.|$|R
30|$|Because of {{the fully}} {{compressive}} {{nature of the}} stresses distributed along the midpalatal suture in the maxillary protraction therapy simulation, which is opposite to the natural growth transversal tendency, maxillary expansion is highly advisable in clinical cases.

50|$|Ericsson's engine {{can easily}} be {{modified}} to operate in a closed-cycle mode, using a second, lower-pressure, cooled container between the original exhaust and intake. In closed cycle, the lower pressure can be significantly above ambient pressure, and He or H2 working gas can be used. Because of the higher pressure difference between the upward and downward movement of the work-piston, specific output can be greater than of a valveless Stirling engine. The added cost is the valve. Ericsson's engine also minimizes mechanical losses: the power necessary for compression does not go through crank-bearing frictional losses, but is applied directly from the <b>expansion</b> <b>force.</b> The piston-type Ericsson engine can potentially be the highest efficiency heat engine arrangement ever constructed. Admittedly, this {{has yet to be}} proven in practical applications.|$|E
30|$|RPE {{separates}} the two maxillary bones at the midpalatine suture [7],[8]. During <b>expansion,</b> the <b>force</b> of the appliance counteracts the existing anatomical {{resistance from the}} dentoalveolus, midpalatal suture, zygomaxillary buttress, and circummaxillary sutures [9]–[15]. Chaconas and Caputo concluded that the major resistance to <b>expansion</b> <b>forces</b> was not the midpalatal suture but other articulations in the maxilla, such as the zygomatic and sphenoidal sutures [16]. Other RPE studies have proposed that during {{the opening of the}} midpalatal suture, the maxilla moves downward and forward [17], supporting the theories of disarticulation and separation of maxillary segments. However, conventional RPE provokes an orthodontic effect of buccal tipping and movement of the posterior teeth.|$|R
30|$|By placing <b>expansion</b> <b>forces</b> {{closer to}} the maxilla's center of resistance, less tipping occurs with a more lateral {{translation}} of the complex. Further clinical investigation is necessary, but {{this study suggests that}} MARPE can be beneficial in patients with sutures that are fused. Lastly, MARPE is also beneficial in young dolichofacial patients by helping to prevent bone bending and dental tipping.|$|R

30|$|The {{significant}} {{displacement of}} the zygomatic arch is {{probably due to the}} mechanism of action of MSE.

This is in agreement with the finding of a midpalatal suture split in all treated patients in the present study (average suture opening was 4.8  mm at anterior nasal spine and 4.3  mm at posterior nasal spine), and with a negligible buccal tipping of maxillary first molars reported in a previous investigation [26].|$|E
40|$|Steel slag is {{the molten}} {{byproduct}} from steelmaking operations that is subsequently air-cooled for use. It {{has been used}} in cement manufacture and as unbound granular materials in construction. While numerous studies have revealed that concrete containing steel slag aggregate possesses good mechanical properties, and slag, as a byproduct, is cheaper than virgin aggregates, its practical use in Portland cement concrete is currently a forbidden area in the construction practices. What is the practicality, where is the crux of converting research results into to real production, and how to build the bridge between the laboratory experiment and the end products? Based on the philosophy of slag utilization, i. e., laboratory testing, field demonstration, and criteria establishment, the questions to be answered includes (1) two distinct laboratory test methods to determine the <b>expansion</b> <b>force</b> generated by slag particles; (2) conversion of the <b>expansion</b> <b>force</b> of mass slag aggregate to the <b>expansion</b> <b>force</b> of single slag particle; (3) mechanical disruption model of slag failure; and (4) usability criteria for the use of steel slag in a rigid or restrained matrices. The paper introduced the answers for the first two questions; and provides the mechanical model and criterion deduction to answer the other two questions that lead to criteria and specification establishment.

40|$|In Escherichia coli {{the genome}} must be {{compacted}} ∼ 1, 000 -fold to be {{contained in a}} cellular structure termed the nucleoid. It is proposed that {{the structure of the}} nucleoid is determined by a balance of multiple compaction forces and one major <b>expansion</b> <b>force.</b> The latter is mediated by transertion, a coupling of transcription, translation, and translocation of nascent membrane proteins and/or exported proteins. In supporting this notion, it has been shown consistently that inhibition of transertion by the translation inhibitor chloramphenicol results in nucleoid condensation due to the compaction forces that remain active in the cell. Our previous study showed that during optimal growth, RNA polymerase is concentrated into transcription foci or “factories,” analogous to the eukaryotic nucleolus, indicating that transcription and RNA polymerase distribution affect the nucleoid structure. However, the interpretation of the role of transcription {{in the structure of the}} nucleoid is complicated by the fact that transcription is implicated in both compacting forces and the <b>expansion</b> <b>force.</b> In this work, we used a new approach to further examine the effect of transcription, specifically from rRNA operons, on the structure of the nucleoid, when the major <b>expansion</b> <b>force</b> was eliminated. Our results showed that transcription is necessary for the chloramphenicol-induced nucleoid compaction. Further, an active transcription from multiple rRNA operons in chromosome is critical for the compaction of nucleoid induced by inhibition of translation. All together, our data demonstrated that transcription of rRNA operons is a key mechanism affecting genome compaction and nucleoid structure...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This study aims to {{investigate}} the effects of rhBMP- 2 /ACS composite on bone regeneration and mineralization during expansion of the interparietal suture in rats. Forty 10 -week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups (n= 10). The first group (intact group) did not receive any intervention. The second group (expansion control group) received an <b>expansion</b> <b>force</b> of 60 g. The remaining two groups received an <b>expansion</b> <b>force</b> of 60 g and were implanted with an atelo-type I absorbable collagen sponge and rhBMP- 2 /ACS composite positioned on the suture beneath the periosteum. The relapse, relapse ratio, relevant bone remodelling, and calcium and osteocalcin contents were evaluated. Bone regeneration in the interparietal suture was estimated by the histological method. The osteocalcin content was measured by radioimmunoassay, and the calcium content was measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Bone regeneration was more active in the suture after application of the <b>expansion</b> <b>force</b> {{compared with that of}} the suture without any intervention. Bone bridges formed in the rhBMP- 2 /collagen composite group. Both osteocalcin and calcium content were higher in the rhBMP- 2 /collagen composite group than in the other three groups (P< 0. 01). The relapse ratio in the rhBMP- 2 /collagen group was much lower than that in the other two expansion groups (P< 0. 01). RhBMP- 2 /ACS composite can promote bone regeneration and bone mineralization in the expanded suture and decrease the relapse ratio. Thus, the rhBMP- 2 /ACS composite may be therapeutically beneficial to the inhibition of relapse and shortening of the retention period during rapid expansion.

40|$|An {{alternative}} {{signal transduction}} mechanism of polydiacetylene (PDA) sensors is devised by combining stimuli-responsive polymer hydrogel as a matrix and PDA sensory materials as a signal-generating component. We hypothesized that volumetric {{expansion of the}} polymer hydrogel matrix by means of external stimuli can impose stress on the imbedded PDA materials, generating a sensory signal. PDA assembly as a sensory component was ionically linked with the alginate hydrogel in order to transfer the volumetric <b>expansion</b> <b>force</b> of alginate hydrogel efficiently to the sensory PDA molecules. Under the same swelling ratio of alginate hydrogel, alginate gel having embedded 1 -dimensional thin PDA nanofibers (∼ 20 nm diameter) presented a sharp color change while 0 -dimensional PDA liposome did not give any sensory signal when it was integrated in alginate gel. The results implied that dimensionality is an important design factor to realize stimuli-responsive matrix-driven colorimetric PDA sensory systems; more effective contact points between 1 -dimensional PDA nanofibers and the alginate matrix much more effectively transfer the external stress exerted by the volumetric <b>expansion</b> <b>force,</b> and thin PDA nanofibers respond more sensitively to the stress. clos...|$|E
