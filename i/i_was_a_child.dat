You see, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> I lived in Italy, and in Italy we have no Santa Claus. I suppose that Santa Claus is much too busy with American children {{to be able to}} handle Italian children as well. Our gifts were brought to us by the Three Kings, instead.|$|E
25|$|I cannot {{forget that}} ever since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> Fitzwilliam has been, in all situations, my warmest and most affectionate friend, {{and the person}} in the world of whom decidedly I have the best opinion, and so in most respects I have still, but as a {{politician}} I cannot reconcile his conduct with what I (who have known him for more than five-and-thirty years) have always thought to be his character. I think they have all behaved very ill to me, and for most of them, who certainly owe much more to me than I do to them, I feel nothing but contempt, and do not trouble myself about them; but Fitzwilliam is an exception indeed.|$|E

500|$|Along with The Dark Knight Returns, Tim Burton has {{mentioned}} that The Killing Joke influenced his film adaptation of Batman: [...] "I {{was never a}} giant comic book fan, but I've always loved the image of Batman and the Joker. The reason I've never been a comic book fan — and I think it started when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> — is because I could never tell which box I was supposed to read. I don't {{know if it was}} dyslexia or whatever, but that's why I loved The Killing Joke, because for the first time I could tell which one to read. It's my favorite. It's the first comic I've ever loved. And the success of those graphic novels made our ideas more acceptable." ...|$|E
500|$|In track 9 {{of their}} 2008 debut album Le Pop, Norwegian band Katzenjammer {{performed}} a song entitled [...] "Virginia Clemm". Set {{to the tune}} of a musical clock, the song's lyrics refer to Virginia's early marriage at 13 years of age ("He was a child <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> / Sentimental and wild"), to her husband's alleged affairs ("The other woman to explain / Her letters I deplore"), to her untimely death ("For twelve short years / We lived out of health"), to the band's perceived obsessions of Poe's subsequent obsession with his wife's death ("Heir of my illness / Writer of all the stories and the words / That I'm haunting / That I'm haunting") as well as alluding, in the last verse ("And I'll leave you nevermore"), to the poem [...] "The Raven".|$|E
500|$|A mutant, {{who is one}} of Xavier's earlier {{students}} and the leader of the X-Men in Cyclops' absence. Storm is a woman with the ability to manipulate the weather. [...] Berry had stated during interviews for X2 that she would not return unless the character had a significant presence comparable to the comic book version, leading to a larger role in The Last Stands script. Berry declared that her ethnicity made the actress identify with the cure plot: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> I felt that if only I could change myself, my life would be better. As I've gotten older, I've come to terms with what utter nonsense that is." [...] The character was given a more modern haircut, and costume designer Judianna Makovsky opted to give Storm more black clothes, a color she only wore in the leather costume for previous films, to make her [...] "tougher and sexier".|$|E
6000|$|... "A man of ready wit {{with a quick}} eye," [...] replied Tell complacently, [...] "never gets hurt. The {{mountain}} has no terror for her <b>children.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> of the mountain." ...|$|R

500|$|Davey {{performed}} a nationwide tour in late May 2007, debuting songs from her follow-up album which she initially {{referred to as}} Silversleeve. All {{but two of the}} songs were recorded in her home. The album, released under the title Tales of Silversleeve and produced by Liam Howe of Sneaker Pimps, was preceded by [...] "Reuben", its first single, on 21 September 2007. Davey explained the title choice, [...] "I had a runny nose when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> and let's just say I didn't wipe it with a tissue". This proved to be a successful move as it led to a Choice Music Prize nomination for 2007 Irish Album of the Year. RTÉ reviewer Harry Guerin said it was [...] "even more imaginative" [...] than her debut and gave it four out of five stars. entertainment.ie reviewer Lauren Murphy described the record as [...] "Without doubt, one of the best albums of the year", noting [...] "there's a magic about Tales of Silversleeve that makes it an album you're almost afraid to listen to twice, in case it's not as good as you remember the first time". The Irish Independent's reviewer gave the album five stars, describing it as [...] "a record that she can be proud of". Jim Carroll, The Irish Times rock critic, called it [...] "The most charming pop album you'll hear in Zero Seven".|$|E
500|$|In January 2008, Usher's father, Usher Raymond III, died. Both men regretted not {{spending}} more time in each other's lives. [...] "Prayer for You", the seventh track on Here I Stand, is an interlude dedicated to Usher's son, reflective on {{his relationship with his}} own father; [...] "No matter what happened, my father always prayed for me. The only difference is, I'm gonna be there to be the father that my dad wished he was to me." [...] The first album name that artists and repertoire representative Mark Pitts conceived was [...] "Measure of a Man", but that title had already been used by Clay Aiken for his debut album, so Usher called it Here I Stand. Pitts said, [...] "It was perfect because becoming a man is about going though pain, sorrow, and happiness. Usher's done that! From the love songs to the party joints, it's exactly the story he wanted to tell." [...] Usher noted Here I Stand as beginning [...] "a new chapter in my life"; the album's liner notes contain a verse from 1 Corinthians 13: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things." [...] Here I Stand marked Usher's growth from boyhood to manhood. In March 2007, it was announced that work on the album had begun. Usher outlined the album's concept: [...] "A lot of what I plan to offer with this album is kinda standing in this spot ... The king's back. I ain't gonna say 'back,' I never left." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1990, Mirren {{stated in}} an {{interview}} that she is an atheist. In the August 2011 issue of Esquire magazine, Mirren said, [...] "I am quite spiritual.

2500|$|Commenting on her reintroduction, Bissix has said, [...] "To {{be able to}} reprise {{the role}} of Clare, who I played when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> {{is such a great}} compliment. It’s fantastic to grab {{something}} that once was and try and develop it into something different. I’m loving every minute." [...] Clare Bates made her reappearance on-screen on 1 February 2008 — in her first scene she was thrown {{out of the back of}} a car by her lover, the CEO of a big company.|$|E
2500|$|There was {{a decline}} in {{production}} of Liberian goods in the late 19th century, and the government struggled financially, resulting in indebtedness {{on a series of}} international loans. On July 16, 1892, Martha Ann Erskine Ricks met Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle and presented her a hand made quilt, Liberia's first diplomatic gift. Born into slavery in Tennessee, Ricks stated, [...] "I had heard it often, from the time <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> how good the Queen had been to my people – to slaves – and how she wanted us to be free." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Pompei, Longo later recounted, he {{was shocked}} at {{the erosion of the}} people’s faith. He wrote, “Their {{religion}} was a mixture of superstition and popular tradition. ... For their every need, ... they would go to a witch, a sorceress, in order to obtain charms and witchcraft.” Through talking to the citizens, Bartolo came to recognize their severe lack of catechesis. When he asked one man if there was only one God, the fellow answered, “When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> I remember people telling me there were three. Now, after so many years, I don‘t know if one of them is dead or one has married.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Because <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> in {{the house}} of my people, and they will not allow me to leave even for a day," [...] she answered, {{thinking}} that this reply would appeal to a race who believe absolutely in obedience to parents and every established authority.|$|R
6000|$|... "I beg {{you will}} not do {{anything}} of the kind, Tertius," [...] said Rosamond, looking at him with something more marked than usual in her speech. [...] "It will be treating me as if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> Promise that you will leave the subject to me." ...|$|R
2500|$|Hung recalled, [...] "I {{remember}} that the police visited our house frequently when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> My parents sometimes frightened the children {{by saying that the}} police will visit if we misbehaved." [...] But her father never dwelt on the past in front of the children: [...] "although my father had resentments toward the authorities, regrets within his heart, and guilt for the family and children, he never expressed those feelings. I only heard him complain once to my mother, 'Haven't the KMT hurt us enough?'" [...] Even with the family in a poor financial status after his release from prison, Hung's father was still hospitable to his friends and often invited them over for dinner and conversation.|$|E
2500|$|... "We {{have signed}} a {{world-class}} player. He {{comes with a}} massive reputation and I believe he's {{one of the most}} exciting signings we have made," [...] said Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier after the transfer had been completed. Litmanen also expressed his pleasure with the move: [...] "It has always been my dream to play for Liverpool. I have supported them since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> and there has been talk about me joining them before." [...] He wanted to wear the number seven shirt as worn by his boyhood hero Kenny Dalglish, but this had already been taken by Vladimír Šmicer. As shirt numbers 17 and 27 were also in use, he settled for the number 37.|$|E
2500|$|Born in Augusta, Georgia, Jasper Johns {{spent his}} early life in Allendale, South Carolina, with his {{paternal}} grandparents after his parents' marriage failed. He then {{spent a year}} living with his mother in Columbia, South Carolina, and thereafter he spent several years living with his aunt Gladys in Lake Murray, South Carolina, twenty-two miles from Columbia. He completed Edmunds High School (now Sumter High School) class of 1947 in Sumter, South Carolina, where he once again lived with his mother. Recounting this period in his life, he once said, [...] "In the place where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> there were no artists {{and there was no}} art, so I really didn't know what that meant.

2500|$|She is, however, {{at pains}} to stress the {{differences}} between Narnia and her world: [...] "Narnia is literally a different world", she says, [...] "whereas in the Harry books {{you go into a}} world within a world that you can see if you happen to belong. A lot of the humour comes from collisions between the magic and the everyday world. Generally there isn't much humour in the Narnia books, although I adored them when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> I got so caught up I didn't think CS Lewis was especially preachy. Reading them now I find that his subliminal message isn't very subliminal."

2500|$|The {{complaint}} from Ellison {{and company}} came after Lindner made several comments he {{made on the}} floor of the House while he “introduced a bill that would repeal the state's pro-gay human rights amendment and remove sexual orientation from its hate-crimes law.” Lindner said [...] "Most of my life, when the word Holocaust was referred to, it usually referred to the Jewish suffering and death that occurred under the Nazi occupation. It's just been within the recent two or three years that it's been brought forward that homosexuals also suffered like that....It never happened. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> during World War II, and I've read a lot about World War II. It's just been recently that anyone's come out with this idea that homosexuals were persecuted to this extent. There's been a lot of rewriting of history." ...|$|E
