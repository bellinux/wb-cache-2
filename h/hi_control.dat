40|$|Remote ischemic postconditioning (RIPostC) is a {{promising}} therapeutic intervention {{that could be}} administered {{as an alternative to}} cooling in cases of perinatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI). In the current study we hypothesized that RIPostC in the piglet model of birth asphyxia confers protection by reducing nitrosative stress and subsequent nitrotyrosine formation, as well as having an effect on glial immunoreactivity. Postnatal day 1 (P 1) piglets underwent HI brain injury and were randomised to <b>HI</b> (<b>control)</b> or HI + RIPostC. Immunohistochemistry assessment 48 hours after HI revealed a significant decrease in brain nitrotyrosine deposits in the RIPostC-treated group (p= 0. 02). This was accompanied by a significant increase in eNOS expression (p< 0. 0001) and decrease in iNOS (p= 0. 010), with no alteration in nNOS activity. Interestingly, RIPostC treatment was associated with a significant increase in GFAP (p= 0. 002) and IBA 1 (p= 0. 006), markers of astroglial and microglial activity, respectively. The current study demonstrates a beneficial effect of RIPostC therapy in the preclinical piglet model of neonatal asphyxia, which appears to be mediated by modulation of nitrosative stress, despite glial activation...|$|E

METHOD: Speakers were 10 Cantonese adolescents (mean age= 13; 5 [years;months]) who were profoundly hearing impaired (<b>HI).</b> <b>Control</b> speakers were 10 adolescents (mean age= 13; 5) with normal hearing. Stimuli were Cantonese words that were minimally contrastive in place of final stops (/p, t, k/). Listeners were 10 final-year speech therapy students. The frequencies of F 1, F 2, and F 3 were measured at the middle, 40 ms before the end, {{and at the end of}} the vocalic segments. RESULTS: Control speakers distinguished place contrasts through formant frequency differences at the end positions of the vowels. HI speakers produced final stops with missing formant transitions and neutralized vowels preceding final stops. Listeners relied on F 2 transition cues for stops produced by control speakers, whereas F 1 and F 3 transition cues were used for stops produced by HI speakers. CONCLUSIONS: Formant frequencies of final stops produced by HI speakers showed reduced place distinction. When listeners identified the place of final stops produced by HI speakers, they relied on formant frequency cues that were different from those used for stops produced by control speakers...|$|E

Seven-day-old male rat pups were divided into six groups: normoxia control, normoxia EPO, hypoxia control, hypoxia EPO, <b>HI</b> <b>control,</b> and HI EPO group. Sham surgery or HI was performed in all animals. HI was induced by ligation of the right common carotid artery followed by 90 min of hypoxia with 8 % oxygen. Recombinant human EPO 3 U/g or saline was administered intraperitoneally, immediately, at 24 - and 48 -hr after insult. At two weeks after insult, animals were challenged with cylinder-rearing test for evaluating forelimb asymmetry to determine sensorimotor function. All animals were then sacrificed for volumetric analysis of the cerebral hemispheres and the SVZ. The saline-treated HI rats showed marked asymmetry by preferential use of the non-impaired, ipsilateral paw in the cylinder-rearing test. Volumetric analysis of brains revealed significantly decreased preserved ipsilateral hemispheric volume and increased ipsilateral SVZ volume compared with the sham-operated animals.

In contrast, high salt (1 %) treatment alone caused only a twofold decrease in kidney renin mRNA content, as compared with values in controls. DOCA and low salt (0. 04 %) or low salt (0. 04 %) treatment alone caused a 1. 5 -fold Increase in the kidney renin mRNA content, as compared with values in control rats. These results indicate that DOCA and salt have a synergistic effect in depressing renin mRNA levels in kidney. Clipping of the left renal artery caused a threefold increase hi the steady state level of renin mRNA in the iscbemic kidney and a 0. 5 -fold decrease in the hypertrophied kidney.

Pregnant and nursing dams were treated with oral captopril (100 mg/kg). After weaning, offspring were maintained on captopril (50 mg/kg). The average systolic pressures after 21 weeks of captopril treatment were 122 ± 3 mm Hg (male) and 118 ± 4 mm Hg (female) as compared with 169 ± 4 mm Hg (male) and 162 ± 2 mm Hg (female) in age-matched controls.

To assure that treatment A was well-watered, we compared field daily ETc values against ETc obtained with the Penman-Monteith (PM) combination equation incorporating the Orgaz et al. (2007) bulk daily canopy conductance (gc) model, validated for our non-limiting conditions. We then tested the hypothesis of indirectly monitoring olive ETc from readily available vegetation index (VI) and ground-based plant water stress indicator. In the process we used the FAO 56 dual crop coefficient (Kc) approach. For the HI olive trees we defined Kcb as the basal transpiration coefficient, and we related Kcb to remotely sensed Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) through a Kcb-SAVI functional relationship. For the MI treatment, we defined the actual transpiration ETc {{as the product of}} Kcb and the stress reduction coefficient Ks obtained as the ratio of actual to crop ETc, and we correlated Ks with MI midday stem water potential (ψst) values through a Ks-ψ functional relationship. Operational monitoring of ETc was then implemented with the ETc = Kcb(SAVI) Ks(ψ) ETo relationship stemmed from the FAO 56 approach and validated taking as inputs collected SAVI and ψst data reporting to year 2011. Low validation error (6 %) and high goodness-of-fit of prediction were observed (R 2 = 0. 94, RSME = 0. 2 mm day- 1, P = 0. 0015), allowing to consider that under field conditions it is possible to predict ETc values for our hedgerow olive orchards if SAVI and water potential (ψst) values are known...|$|E
40|$|Canine {{distemper}} (CD) {{is one of}} the longest-known {{infectious diseases}} of dogs and is still prevalent {{in many parts of the}} world. Vaccination combined with biosecurity measures is the most productive way to prevent and control infectious diseases. The beneficial effects of vaccination are realized not only on the individual but also on the population level, the latter in the form of herd immunity (<b>HI).</b> <b>Control</b> of CD among dogs relies heavily on vaccination, while in fur farms and zoos with several species or large numbers of CD-susceptible animals in close contact, biosecurity measures in some cases offer the only available means for CD control. Modified live CD virus vaccines have been successfully used to control CD among farmed mink, and since no licensed vaccines for other species kept for fur exist, mink CD vaccines have also been used for foxes and raccoon dogs in CD emergency situations. CD vaccines for dogs (Canis familiaris) and mink (Mustela vison) were studied in experimental settings for their ability to induce virus-neutralising (VN) antibodies in target species. Mink vaccines were also assessed in silver foxes (Vulpes vulpes), blue foxes (Alopex lagopus) and raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides). Purpose-bred beagle dogs were vaccinated twice with one of three CD vaccines: Candur® SHP, Canlan®- 3 or Dohyvac® DA 2 P, and the levels of VN antibodies were determined at the time of vaccination and one month after the second vaccination. Fur animals were vaccinated once with Distemink®, Distem®-R-TC or vaccine 3 (which was not licensed in Finland) and the levels of VN antibodies were determined at vaccination and 2 - 4 times 1 - 4 months afterwards. Significant differences among vaccine groups were found both in the proportion of animals with measurable levels of VN antibodies and in the mean titres of antibodies. The levels of VN antibodies were also determined from a large field sample (n = 4 627) of vaccinated dogs. In addition to the three CD vaccines in the seroconversion study above, additional two vaccines, Duramune®- 4 and Nobivac® DHP, had been used in the field. Each dog with a known vaccination history, date of birth, sex and breed was sampled once. Based on the overall geometric mean titre of the dogs vaccinated with a single vaccine brand, vaccines were divided into high-take (Candur®, Nobivac® and Duramune®) and low-take (Dohyvac® and Canlan®) groups. The vaccine groups differed significantly among dogs less than two years of age both in the proportion of dogs with detectable VN antibodies and in the mean titres. Both the number of vaccinations and age were associated with the titre and vaccine usage. To control for possible confounding factors, the comparison 8 of titres among vaccine usage groups was adjusted by classifying them according to the number of vaccinations (one to four) and the age group (less than one, one to two, or over two years old). The same division into low- and high-take vaccines was observed, irrespective of the number of vaccinations the dogs had received. The observations of this seroprevalence study regarding Candur®, Canlan® and Dohyvac® were consistent with the results of the seroconversion study. CD was reintroduced into Finland in 1990 after 16 years of absence. The disease remained at a low endemic level in 1990 - 1994, reached epidemic proportions in 1994 - 1995 and disappeared during 1995. The epidemic also involved vaccinated dogs. Among the virologically-confirmed cases the proportion of Dohyvac®-vaccinated dogs was higher than expected from the market shares on the assumption that all the vaccines had an equal take. As a result of this observation, Dohyvac® was withdrawn from and Nobivac® and Duramune® introduced to the market during 1995. A drastic redistribution of the market shares between the low-take and high-take vaccines took place, and this coincided with the decline and dying out of the outbreak. The observed occurrence pattern of CD from 1990 - 1996 was largely attributed to the changes in the level of HI, although the possible contribution of other factors, such as developments in the dog demographics, was also recognized. It was concluded that an HI above 75 % is needed to keep CD in check, i. e., only sporadic cases of CD, at most, can occur. With the currently used vaccines an HI of 80 % corresponds to a vaccine coverage of some 94 %. It was concluded that the development of vaccine-induced immunity is a multifactorial process depending on the properties of the vaccine, on the individual variation, age, species and other factors influencing the immunocompetence of the host. On the individual level the prevention of clinical signs is sufficient, but on the population level, halting the circulation of the virus is crucial for the definitive control of CD. The ultimate test and criterion for a vaccine is its contribution to herd immunity. Heterogeneity in the dog population contributes to the occurrence of CD...|$|E

Here we demonstrate that SVZ derived neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPs) from PC, HI and PC+HI piglets proliferated as neurospheres, expressed neural progenitor and neurodevelopmental markers, and that greater proportion of the spheres generated are multipotential. Neurosphere assay revealed that preconditioning pretreatment increased the number of NSP-derived neurospheres in SVZ following HI compared to normoxic and <b>HI</b> <b>controls.</b> NSPs from preconditioned SVZ generated twice as many neurons and astrocytes in vitro.

Intracerebroventricular injection of leumorphin (60 or 600 pmol) significantly inhibited basal vasopressin secretion. The vasopressin response induced by intracerebroventricular injection of angiotensin II (100 pmol) was significantly suppressed, hi a dose-dependent fashion, by the simultaneous intracerebroventricular injection of leumorphin (6, 60, or 600 pmol). Intravenous pretreatment with naloxone (0. 5 mg/kg body weight) diminished the inhibitory action of leumorphin (60 pmol) on vasopressin secretion. Moreover, naloxone (0. 5 mg/kg body weight) prolonged the vasopressin secretion induced by intracerebroventricular injection of angiotensin II (100 pmol).

Procedure: PTA was assessed using the R-WPTAS (includes a visual memory component) and the PTA-I (includes retrospective and verbal memory components), in patients attending an ED with (n= 30) or without (n= 30) HI. Outcome measures were the Post-concussion Syndrome Checklist (PCSC) and the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). McNemar’s Tests and Chi-square analyses {{were used to determine}} the results. Results: The verbal memory component overestimated PTA in the control group by 24 %. Overall, the PTA-I did not discriminate between <b>HI</b> and <b>control</b> participants. However the retrospective PTA assessment embedded within the PTA-I did, with 100 % accuracy. Conclusions: The use of a verbal memory component to assess PTA in the ED is not supported by the results of this study. A retrospective PTA assessment appears to allow more accurate decision making regarding the admission criteria used in the ED and has advantages over the R-WPTAS: fewer test materials and no repeat assessments required to achieve an estimate of PTA duration.

40|$|Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is {{a lethal}} {{complication}} of allogeneic {{bone marrow transplantation}} (BMT). Immunosuppressive agents are currently used to control GVHD but may cause general immune suppression and limit the effectiveness of BMT. Adoptive transfer of regulatory T cells (T(regs)) can prevent GVHD in rodents, suggesting a therapeutic potential of T(regs) for GVHD in humans. However, the clinical application of T(reg) -based therapy is hampered by the low frequency of human T(regs) {{and the lack of}} a reliable model to test their therapeutic effects in vivo. Recently, we successfully generated human alloantigen-specific CD 8 (hi) T(regs) in a large scale from antigenically naive precursors ex vivo using allogeneic CD 40 -activated B cells as stimulators. We report a human allogeneic GVHD model established in humanized mice to mimic GVHD after BMT in humans. We demonstrate that ex vivo-induced CD 8 (<b>hi)</b> T(regs) <b>controlled</b> GVHD in an allospecific manner by reducing alloreactive T cell proliferation as well as decreasing inflammatory cytokine and chemokine secretion within target organs through a CTLA- 4 -dependent mechanism in humanized mice. These CD 8 (hi) T(regs) induced long-term tolerance effectively without compromising general immunity and graft-versus-tumor activity. Our results support testing of human CD 8 (hi) T(regs) in GVHD in clinical trials. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Sulindac sulfide is a non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID) with chemopreventive {{effect on}} human cancer cells. Due to {{the involvement of the}} somatic recombination in the carcinogenic process, sulindac sulfide’s recombinogenic potential was evaluated by the Homozygotization Index (HI) in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans. The drug’s recombinogenic potential was evaluated by its capacity to induce homozygosis of recessive genes from heterozygous diploid cells. Sulindac sulfide at 175 and 350 µM concentrations induced mitotic recombination in A. nidulans diploid cells, with HI values for genetic markers higher than 2. 0, and significantly different from <b>control</b> <b>HI</b> values. The recombinogenic effect of NSAID was related to the induction of DNA strand breaks and cell cycle alterations. Sulindac sulfide’s carcinogenic potential was also discussed.

40|$|Ocular {{dominance}} plasticity (ODP) following monocular deprivation (MD) is a {{model of}} activity-dependent neural plasticity that is restricted to an early critical period regulated by maturation of inhibition. Unique developmental plasticity mechanisms may improve outcomesfollowingearlybraininjury. Ourobjectivewastodeterminetheeffectsofneonatalcerebralhypoxia–ischemia(HI) onODP. The rationale extends from observations that neonatal HI results in death of subplate neurons, a transient population known to influence development of inhibition. In rodents subjected to neonatal <b>HI</b> and <b>controls,</b> maps of visual response were derived from optical imaging during the critical period for ODP and changes in the balance of eye-specific response following MD were measured. In controls, MD results in a shift of the ocular dominance index (ODI) from a baseline of 0. 15 to � 0. 10 (p � 0. 001). Neonatal HI with moderate cortical injury impairs this shift, ODI � 0. 14 (p � 0. 01). Plasticity was intact in animals with mild injury and in those exposed to hypoxia alone. Neonatal HI resulted in decreased parvalbumin expression in hemispheres receiving HI compared with hypoxia alone: 23. 4 versus 35. 0 cells/high-power field (p � 0. 01), with no change in other markers of inhibitory or excitatory neurons. Despite abnormal inhibitory neuronphenotype,spontaneousactivityofsingleunitsanddevelopmentoforientationselectiveresponseswereintactfollowingneonatal HI, while overall visual responses were reduced.

40|$|Volume {{regulation}} of C 6 glial cells was studied in anoxia in vitro {{to improve the}} understanding of ischemic cell swelling in the brain. Contrary to in vivo conditions, anoxia or anoxia plus iodoacetate for additional inhibition of anaerobic energy metabolism did not induce glial swelling. However, intracellular K+ was markedly decreased while intracellular Na+ increased. Induction of energy failure by anoxia plus iodoacetate was found to prevent the regulatory volume decrease on hyposmotic exposure of the cells, which is regularly observed <b>hi</b> normoxic <b>control</b> conditions. Hyposmotic expo-sure hi anoxia plus iodoacetate led only to an initial tendency of cell volume normalization followed by secondary cell swelling. This {{was associated with a}} net increase of intracellular Na+ that may explain the failure of volume regulation under these circumstances. Maintenance of a normal glial cell size during complete energy deprivation by anoxia plus iodoacetate hi isotonic medium strongly indicates that energy failure per se does not suffice to induce cell swelling. Cell swelling hi cerebral ischemia in vivo thus is likely to require additional mechanisms, most likely an Increase of membrane permeability to Na+, which may be caused by release and accumulation of excitotoxins such as glutamate or by an extracellular release of K+. Such a mechanism would hardly influence the extracellular homeostasis in vitro due to the large medium-to-cell volume ratio. The findings demonstrate, nonetheless, th...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cerebral hypoxia/ischemia (HI) is not {{uncommon}} during the perinatal period. If occurring, it can result in severe neurologic disabilities that persist throughout life. Salvinorin A, a non-opioid Kappa opioid receptors (KOR) selective agonist, {{has the potential to}} address this devastating situation. We have demonstrated that salvinorin A administration before HI, preserves pial artery autoregulative function through both the KOR and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) pathways. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that administration of salvinorin A after HI could preserve cerebral autoregulation via KOR and ERK pathway. Methodology/Principal Findings: The response of the pial artery to hypercapnia, hypotension and isoproterenol were monitored before and 1 hour after HI in piglets equipped with a cranial window. Four groups of drug administration were performed after <b>HI.</b> The <b>control</b> group had DMSO (1 ml/kg, i. v.) administrated immediately after HI. Two salvinorin A treated groups had salvinorin A (10 mg/kg, i. v.) administrated 0 and 30 min after HI, respectively. The 4 th group had salvinorin A and the KOR antagonist norbinaltorphimine (Nor-BIN, 1 mM topical) co-administrated 0 min after HI (n = 5). The dilation responses of the pial artery to hypercapnia and hypotension were impaired after global HI and were preserved with salvinorin A administration immediately or 30 min after HI. The preservation of autoregulation was abolished when nor-BIN was administered. Levels of phosphor-ERK(pERK) /ERK in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were measured before and 1 hou...|$|R
40|$|Vegetative {{incompatibility}} is {{a widespread}} phenomenon in filamentous ascomycetes, which limits formation of viable heterokaryons. Whether this phenomenon {{plays a role in}} maintaining the homokaryotic state of the hyphae during the vegetative growth of Tuber spp. Gene expression, polymorphism analysis as well as targeted in vitro experiments allowed us to test whether a heterokaryon incompatibility (HI) system operates in Tuber melanosporum. <b>HI</b> is <b>controlled</b> by different genetic systems, often involving HET domain genes and their partners whose interaction can trigger a cell death reaction. Putative homologues to HI-related genes previously characterized in Neurospora crassa and Podospora anserina were identified in the T. melanosporum genome. However, only two HET domain genes were found. In many other ascomycetes HET domains have been found within different genes including some members of the NWD (NACHT and WD-repeat associated domains) gene family of P. anserina. More than 50 NWD homologues were found in T. melanosporum but none of these contain a HET domain. All these T. melanosporum paralogs showed a conserved gene organization similar to the microexon genes only recently characterized in Schistosoma mansoni. Expression data of the annotated HI-like genes along with low allelic polymorphism suggest that they have cellular functions unrelated to HI. Moreover, morphological analyses did not provide evidence for HI reactions between pairs of genetically different T. melanosporum strains. Thus, the maintenance of the genetic integrity during the vegetative growth of this species likely depends on mechanisms that act before hyphal fusion. (C) 2011 British Mycological Society.

40|$|Tinnitus, usually {{associated}} with hearing loss, {{is characterized by the}} perception of sound without an external sound source. The pathophysiology of tinnitus is poorly understood. In the present study, voxel-based morphometiy (VBM) was employed to identify gray matter differences related to hearing loss and tinnitus. VBM was applied to magnetic resonance images of normal-hearing control subjects (n = 24), hearing-impaired subjects without tinnitus (n = 16, HI group) and hearing-impaired subjects with tinnitus (n = 31, HI + T group). This design allowed us to disentangle the gray matter (GM) differences related to hearing loss and tinnitus, respectively. Voxel-based VBM analyses revealed that both HI and HI + T groups, relative to the controls, had GM increases in the superior and middle temporal gyri, and decreases in the superior frontal gyrus, occipital lobe and hypothalamus. We did not find significant GM differences between both patient groups. Subsequent region-of-interest (ROI) analyses of all Brodmann Areas, the cerebellum and the subcortical auditory nuclei showed a GM increase in the left primary auditory cortex of the tinnitus patients compared to the <b>HI</b> and <b>control</b> groups. Moreover, GM decreases were observed in frontal areas and mainly GM increases in limbic areas, both of which occurred for hearing loss irrespective of tinnitus, relative to the controls. These results suggest a specific role of the left primary auditory cortex and the additional involvement of various non-auditory brain structures in tinnitus. Understanding the causal relation between these GM changes and tinnitus will be an important next step in understanding tinnitus mechanisms. (c) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{questionnaire}} {{was sent to}} the parents of 77 visually impaired (VI), 210 hearing impaired (<b>HI)</b> and 494 <b>control</b> children seeking their views on their child's dental appearance, orthodontic treatment need and issues that might influence the child undertaking treatment. The parents' views were compared with a dentist's assessment of treatment need using the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN). There was disagreement between the dentist's assessment and the parents' perceptions in all groups. However, the least disagreement was seen in the HI group. There was a statistically significant (P < 0. 05) association between <b>control</b> and <b>HI</b> parents' views of their children's treatment needs and their opinion on their dental appearance. Most parents thought that orthodontic treatment was difficult to obtain and expensive and that their child would find difficulty coping with the treatment. Furthermore, parents of VI children considered that treatment was unlikely to be undertaken due to their child's reduced concern for their appearance. The study indicates that the awareness of treatment need for VI and HI children differs between their parents and dentists. King Saud Universit...|$|R
