2500|$|In February 2015, Ayako Sono, {{a former}} member of an {{education}} reform panel, wrote a controversial column in Sankei Shimbun suggesting that more foreign workers be imported to meet labor shortages, but that they be separated from native Japanese in a system of apartheid. She later explained [...] "I have never commended apartheid, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> existence of a ‘Chinatown’ or ‘Little Tokyo’ is a good thing." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{will do what}} I can, Mr. Godolphin," [...] Maxwell promised, {{while he}} knitted his brows in perplexity [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> very {{strength}} of Salome gives relief to Haxard--gives him greater importance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well! <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> you was {{a gentleman}} that would not go back from your word. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> you would never put a young lady to the {{necessity}} of bringing forward her own letters to prove {{that she is not}} expecting more than she has a right! You don't know! And that, after all that has been between us! John Eames!" [...] And again it seemed to him as though she were about to fly.|$|R
60|$|I was silent. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{that was}} just {{what he was trying}} to <b>do,</b> but <b>I</b> hardly cared to say so.|$|R
6000|$|MRS TARLETON. Well I never! John: <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> young woman's {{right in}} her head. Do {{you know what}} shes just asked for? ...|$|R
6000|$|... “We mustn’t count our {{chickens}} too soon, Mr. Palethorpe,” Will laughed; “but nevertheless <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{prospects are}} favourable. Still, I must wait {{the result of}} the search that my lawyer has been carrying on.” ...|$|E
60|$|At {{the same}} time <b>I</b> <b>DO</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Government makes a mistake in taxing the profits of the poor book writers under the absurd name of INCOME. But let that go. The Kaiser would {{probably}} treat us worse.|$|E
6000|$|... "Soldiering? Well, I {{shall have}} to train up a bit and see. Beastly ugly work they seem to make of it, nowadays. I don't mind {{roughing}} {{it up to the}} extent of my capacity, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> advice of one's medical man should be taken into consideration." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As a bystander," [...] said Fanny, [...] "perhaps I {{saw more}} than you did; and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Rushworth was {{sometimes}} very jealous." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By heaven!" [...] cried Amyas, [...] "Frank speaks like a book; and for me, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Christian gentlemen {{may leave}} love quarrels to bulls and rams." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{mean the}} Bishop; though <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{he has shown}} a great want of what I may call liberality towards a clergyman in his diocese." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am here, my worthy incognito," [...] {{cried the}} other, {{with the voice}} of perfect good nature; [...] "lying {{in the lap of}} mother earth, and all the better for opening a vein or two in my right leg;--though <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> same effect might have been {{produced}} without treating the bone so roughly!--But I opine that I saw you also reclining on the bosom of our common ancestor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Ned; I am {{sure they}} are not white; then they must be mutineers. Look! Look! Don't you see they have got three prisoners? There they are, marching {{in the middle of}} that column; they are officers; and oh! Ned! <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> middle one's father." [...] And the excited boy, with tears of joy running down his cheeks, would have risen and dashed out had not Ned {{forcibly}} detained him.|$|E
6000|$|There is (1) {{the mention}} of a Paduan adventure, {{the basis of the}} plot, a thing that Sprot is very {{unlikely}} to have invented. With all my admiration for Sprot, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Paduan touch is beyond him. This occurs in Letter IV, ‘the good sport that M.A., your lordship’s brother, told me of a nobleman in Padua. It is a parasteur’ (? à propos) ‘to this purpose we have in hand.’ This appears in Letter I, ‘reckless toys of Padua,’ and in Letter V, ‘bid M. A. remember on the sport he told me of Padua.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{shall be}} here, sir," [...] he said, [...] "and I thank you heartily for {{engaging}} him; and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he means {{this time to}} behave himself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is news to me, Peter, and I am {{surprised}} to hear it. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> even the great Tecumthe was scarcely as big a chief as you are yourself." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have had}} the kindest letter from Moore. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> man is the best-hearted, the only hearted being I ever encountered; and, then, his talents are equal to his feelings.|$|R
6000|$|... 'One thing <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> being conversant {{only with}} {{thoughtful}} educated Christians {{may result in}} a person ignoring the simpler idea of the Eucharist which does not in the least divest it of its mysterious character, but rather, recognising the mystery, seeks for no solution of it. How can I teach my fifteen Melanesian Communicants the points which I suppose an advanced Ritualist would regard as most essential? But I can give them the actual words of some of the ancient, really ancient, Liturgies, and teach them what Christ said, and St. Paul said, and the Church of England says, and bid them acquiesce in the mystery.|$|E
60|$|In {{the case}} supposed, the teacher {{concluded}} {{to appeal to}} emulation. While I describe the measure he adopted, let it be remembered that I am now only approving of the resort to ingenuity and invention, and the employment of moral and intellectual means, for the accomplishment of his purposes, and not of the measures themselves. I {{do not think the}} plan I am going to describe a wise one; but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> teacher, while trying it, must have been interested in his intellectual experiment. His business, while pursued in such a way, could not have been a mere dull and uninteresting routine.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{might have}} been well," [...] {{continued}} Armstrong, slowly, while a sad expression clouded his face for a few moments, [...] "if I had waited, and many a time has my conscience smitten me for my haste. But what could I do? Emmy most unaccountably fell in love wi' me--thank God! for <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> greatest earthly blessing that can be given to mortal man is {{the love of a}} gentle, true-hearted girl. The wealth of the Indies cannot purchase that, and nothing else in life can supply the want of it. Can you wonder that I grasped the treasure when within my reach?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I scarce can judge," [...] {{said the}} Italian renegade. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{it were not}} wise for either thou or Asad {{to take the first}} step against the other." ...|$|R
60|$|The painted {{windows of}} the Abbey, though mostly modern, are {{exceedingly}} rich and beautiful; and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> human art has invented no other such magnificent method of adornment as this.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do declare," [...] exclaimed Mrs. Archibald, [...] "everything {{is in the}} newspapers! <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{we might}} settle down here and enjoy {{ourselves}} without people talking about our reason for coming!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly I do. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> England {{which we}} know could not be the England that she is but for the {{maintenance}} of a high-minded, proud, and self-denying nobility. And though with us there is no line dividing our very broad aristocracy into two parts, a higher and a lower, or a greater and a smaller, or a richer and a poorer, nevertheless we all feel that the success of our order depends chiefly on the conduct of those whose rank is the highest and whose means are the greatest. To some few, among whom you are conspicuously one, wealth has been given so great and rank so high that much of the welfare of your country depends on the manner in which you bear yourself as the Duke of Omnium." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wonder too," [...] Godfrey said. [...] "I suppose if I {{had been}} {{a year or two}} older they would have done so; but I can assure you I had not the {{slightest}} idea that Petroff and Akim were Nihilists. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> country is horribly misgoverned, but as a foreigner that was no business of mine; and however strongly I felt, I would have {{had nothing to do with}} men who tried to gain their end by assassination. I was just as innocent in the affair of Ossinsky. I behaved like a fool, I grant, but that was all. I had met the woman, who as I now know was Sophia Perovskaia, but she was only known to me then from having met her once in Petroff and Akim's room, and she was introduced to me as Akim's cousin Katia. I met her at the Opera-house, and she told me a cock-and-bull story about a young officer who had come to see a lady there, and had left his regiment at Moscow without leave to do so. His colonel, who was at the Opera-house, had heard of his being there and was looking for him, and I was persuaded to change dominoes with him to enable him to slip off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I should say, Pierre, {{keep your}} eyes open and escape if you {{possibly}} can before the assault takes place. I should think some might manage to get out as women, but, of course you would have to sacrifice your mustaches. But if you did that, and borrowed the papers of some young woman or other, you might manage it. No doubt it would be awkward if you were found out, but it might be worth trying. If I cannot leave before the assault takes place I mean to go to one of the English hotels here, Meurice's or the Dover, and establish myself there. During such fighting as there may be in the streets, there will be very few questions asked, and one might be shot before one could explain one was a foreigner, but the hotels {{are not likely to be}} disturbed. Seriously I should say that the best thing you can all do when the fighting begins in the streets, is to keep out of the way until your battalion is engaged, then burn anything in the way of uniform, get rid of your rifle somehow, and gather at Goudé's. He could vouch for you all as being his pupils, and as being wholly opposed to the Commune. His name should be sufficiently well known, if not to the first officer who may arrive, at least, to many officers, for his testimony to be accepted. Still, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> best plan of all will be to get out of the place when you get a chance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Where {{should it}} come from but the [...] "Breakfast Table"? Broune and I have been very good friends, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> of all the men I know {{he is the most}} jealous.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just {{as likely}} {{in any other}} station," [...] replied Clement. [...] "The {{protection}} must come from within, not from the externals; and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> she—-yes, and he too—-have that Guard within them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My sins are many, holy prior, and {{cannot be}} too often or too keenly rebuked; but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{they may be}} fairly {{included}} in the general heads that I have endeavored to recall." ...|$|R

5000|$|In May 2008 David Rubenstein stated: [...] "But {{once this}} period is over, once the debt {{on the books}} of the banks is sold and new lending starts, I think you'll see the private equity {{industry}} coming back in what I call the Platinum Age - better than it's ever been before. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> private equity industry has a great future and that the greatest period for private equity is probably ahead of us." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an interview, Chu {{addressed}} a question {{he is often}} asked, [...] "Why do all of your films have dance?" [...] He responded, [...] "I don't know why. It seems so obvious. But there's something about the dancers that motivate me the most. I don't know if it's just dance, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dancers are amazing artists, and every time I meet a new dancer, that triggers something in my brain, and I'm more creative than I could ever be. When I feel that creativity burst, I go with it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I {{love you}} so dearly. Let me say {{something}} very plainly. If it be a long story, forgive me because of its importance to myself. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> you were--well, inclined to like me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{love it when}} I {{get used}} to it," [...] she declared. [...] "To be an English Countess is dazzling, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> ought not to go on singing at Covent Garden." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's the old {{fellow who}} saved my life, ten days ago, Percy," [...] Ralph said; [...] "and by Jove! much obliged {{to him as}} I was, then, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am more {{grateful}} now." ...|$|R
