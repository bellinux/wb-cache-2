5|$|In 1913 Dyer {{was briefly}} Wales welterweight {{champion}} when he beat Jack Delaney, {{who won the}} belt back <b>just</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> later. During his professional career Dyer took two overseas tours, to Australia from 1914 to 1915 and the United States from 1916 to 1919. Due to the time spent in Australia, he became eligible to contest for national titles, unsuccessfully challenging Les Darcy for the welterweight belt in 1915. The highpoint {{of his time in}} America, then during the 'no decision' era, was a win over Panama Joe Gans. Due to a knee injury, Dyer was refused active service during the First World War; instead he was recruited into the United States Army as a boxing instructor.|$|E
5|$|The Wrights {{wrote to}} several engine manufacturers, but none met {{their need for}} a {{sufficiently}} lightweight powerplant. They turned to their shop mechanic, Charlie Taylor, who built an engine in <b>just</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> in close consultation with the brothers. To keep the weight low enough, the engine block was cast from aluminum, a rare practice for the time. The Wright/Taylor engine had a primitive version of a carburetor, and had no fuel pump. Gasoline was gravity-fed from the fuel tank mounted on a wing strut into a chamber next to the cylinders where it was mixed with air: the fuel-air mixture was then vaporized by heat from the crankcase, forcing it into the cylinders.|$|E

5|$|O'Brien {{completed}} a hat-trick of breaststroke doubles at the 1965 Australian Championships, {{but in a}} year with no international competition, he swam much slower times of 1min 11.1s and 2min 38.6s respectively. He {{completed a}} fourth consecutive medley relay win with New South Wales. At the 1966 Australian Championships, his times were again slower, at 1min 11.8s and 2min 41.6s respectively, more than 4% slower than his personal bests, {{but it was still}} enough to retain his titles and qualify for the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Kingston, Jamaica. Critics had written him off, because <b>just</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> before the competition, he was 16kg overweight. However, he returned to his peak form by the time the team reached Jamaica, where he won both breaststroke events with times of 1min 8.2s and 2min 29.3s respectively. His winning run in the 4100m medley relay came to an end when the Australians were disqualified for an illegal changeover.|$|E
5|$|A Vindication of the Rights of Woman {{was written}} against the tumultuous {{background}} of the French Revolution and the debates that it spawned in Britain. In a lively and sometimes vicious pamphlet war, now {{referred to as the}} Revolution controversy, British political commentators addressed topics ranging from representative government to human rights to {{the separation of church and}} state, many of these issues having been raised in France first. Wollstonecraft first entered this fray in 1790 with A Vindication of the Rights of Men, a response to Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790). In his Reflections, Burke criticized the view of many British thinkers and writers who had welcomed the early stages of the French revolution. While they saw the revolution as analogous to Britain's own Glorious Revolution in 1688, which had restricted the powers of the monarchy, Burke argued that the appropriate historical analogy was the English Civil War (1642–1651) in which Charles I had been executed in 1649. He viewed the French revolution as the violent overthrow of a legitimate government. In Reflections he argues that citizens do not have the right to revolt against their government because civilization is the result of social and political consensus; its traditions cannot be continually challenged—the result would be anarchy. One of the key arguments of Wollstonecraft's Rights of Men, published <b>just</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> after Burke's Reflections, is that rights cannot be based on tradition; rights, she argues, should be conferred because they are reasonable and just, regardless of their basis in tradition.|$|E
