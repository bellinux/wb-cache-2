40|$|Clinical {{experience}} {{indicates that}} newly available portable hand-held x-ray units provide advantages compared to traditional fixed properly installed and operated x-ray units in dental radiography. However, concern that hand-held x-ray units produce higher operator doses than fixed x-ray units has caused regulatory agencies to mandate requirements {{for use of}} hand-held units that go beyond those recommended by the manufacturer and can discourage {{the use of this}} technology. To assess the need for additional requirements, a hand-held x-ray unit and a pair of manikins were used to measure the dose to a simulated operator under two conditions: exposures made according to the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s recommendations and exposures made according to manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s recommendation except for the removal of the x-ray unit 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>protective</b> backscatter <b>shield.</b> Dose to the simulated operator was determined using an array of personal dosimeters and a pair of pressurized ion chambers. The results indicate that the dose to an operator of this equipment will be less than 0. 6 mSy y(- 1) if the device is used according to the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s recommendations. This suggests that doses to properly trained operators of well-designed, hand-held dental x-ray units will be below 1. 0 mSv y(- 1) (2...|$|R
40|$|Since its {{founding}} in 1958, NASA has pioneered the use of different frequencies on the electromagnetic spectrum - including X-ray, microwave, and infrared wavelengths - to gather information about distant celestial bodies. During the 1962 Mariner 2 mission, NASA used microwave radiometers that operated {{in the range of}} 15 - 23 gigahertz (GHz) to assess the surface temperature of Venus and to determine the percentage of water vapor in its atmosphere. Today, there is another area on the spectrum proving uniquely useful to scientists: the terahertz (THz) range, spanning from about 100 GHz- 10, 000 GHz. (1 THz equals approximately 1, 000 GHz.) Terahertz frequencies span the lesser-known gap on the electromagnetic spectrum between microwave radiation and infrared (and visible) light, falling within the spectral range where most simple molecules resonate. This molecular resonance makes terahertz particularly useful for chemical spectroscopy and the remote sensing of specific molecules. In the 1990 s, NASA began using frequencies above 300 GHz (more than an order of magnitude higher than the instrumentation on Mariner 2) to perform spectral analysis of molecular clouds and planetary atmospheres. Instruments using these higher frequencies have included the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS), deployed from 1991 - 2001, and the Microwave Instrument for the Rosetta Orbiter (MIRO), launched in 2004. With UARS-MLS, NASA used advanced terahertz receivers to measure the emission signatures from atmospheric molecules, providing researchers with valuable data about the changes in the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>protective</b> ozone layer. MIRO, set to rendezvous with the comet 67 P Churyumov-Gerasimenko in 2014, will use terahertz instrumentation to analyze the comet s dust and gases. Although NASA has been a driving force behind the development of terahertz technology, scientific equipment for terahertz research - including transmitters, receivers, and basic test and measurement equipment - is not widely available, making scientific experiments in this range between traditional electronics and quantum photonics more costly and greatly limiting commercial development in the field. Given NASA s interest in studying distant bodies in space as well as in improving life on Earth, the Agency has collaborated with private industry to develop terahertz technologies...|$|R
40|$|Space Technology 5, {{or better}} known as ST- 5, is a space {{technology}} development mission in the New Millennium Program (NMP) and NASA s first experiment {{in the design of}} miniaturized satellite constellations. The mission will design, integrate and launch multiple spacecraft into an orbit high above the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>protective</b> magnetic field known as the magnetosphere. Each spacecraft incorporates innovative technology and constellation concepts which will be instrumental in future space science missions. A total of three ST- 5 spacecraft will be launched as secondary payloads into a highly elliptical geo-synchronous transfer orbit, and will operate as a 3 -element constellation for a minimum duration of 90 days. In order to correlate the time of science measurements with orbit position relative to the Earth, orbit position in space (with respect to other objects in space) and/or with events measured on Earth or other spacecraft, accurate knowledge of spacecraft and ground time is needed. Ground time as used in the USA (known as Universal Time Coordinated or UTC) is maintained by the U. S. Naval Observatory. Spacecraft time is maintained onboard within the Command and Data Handling (C&DH) system. The science requirements for ST- 5 are that spacecraft time and ground time be correlatable to each other, with some degree of accuracy. Accurate knowledge of UTC time on a spacecraft is required so that science measurements can be correlated with orbit position relative to the Earth, orbit position in space and with events measured on Earth or other spacecraft. The most crucial parameter is not the clock oscillator frequency, but more importantly, how the clock oscillator frequency varies with time or temperature (clock oscillator drift). Even with an incorrect clock oscillator frequency, if there were no drift, the frequency could be assessed by comparing the spacecraft clock to a ground clock during a few correlation events. Once the frequency is accurately known, it is easy enough to make a regular adjustment to the spacecraft clock or to calculate the correct ground time for a given spacecraft clock time. The oscillator frequency, however, is temperature dependent, drifts with age and is affected by radiation; hence, repeated correlation measurements are required...|$|R

40|$|During {{last years}} the {{incidence}} {{and severity of}} ice hockey related concussions have been increased and, hence, something {{should be done to}} stop this growth. The main aim {{of this study was to}} find out how dasher board materials and structures affect impact characteristics and, thereby, the risk of concussions. The measurements were divided into two parts; in the first part, the physiological characteristics of body checks were determined in real game measurements, and the second part, consisted of simulation of body checks in the laboratory. High speed cameras and accelerometers were used to collect data. More flexible <b>protective</b> <b>shielding</b> material (dasher board B) resulted in lower peak force and stiffness as well as greater stopping distance compared to the other dasher boards. However, the dasher board with flexible <b>protective</b> <b>shielding</b> material including shielding supporting posts resulted to be non-consistent and, thereby, that kind of dasher boards cannot be classified as safe ones. Single-framed dasher board was detected to be more flexible than dual-framed counterpart and heavier <b>protective</b> <b>shielding</b> resulted in significantly higher element stiffness (p <. 05). With this study it was shown that modification of the materials and structures of the dasher boards give an opportunity to affect impact characteristics and, thereby, the concussion risk. In the light of the results and the epidemiology of concussions it seems that the most safety dasher board would be single-framed with light and flexible <b>protective</b> <b>shielding</b> material and it would not include shielding supporting posts. However, there are still many questions under debate and, therefore, the investigation must be continued...|$|R

The <b>protective</b> <b>shield</b> designed by Authors is used against HE mines and IEDs up to 10 kg TNT. The system consists of the multiple-use portable range stand, a protected Armox 500 T steel plate and a <b>protective</b> <b>shield.</b> The shield has a multi-layer structure and has the following main layers: PA 11 aluminum, SCACS hybrid laminate, ALPORAS aluminum foam, SCACS hybrid laminate, connected together using SOUDASEAL chemo-set glue.
