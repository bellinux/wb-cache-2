5|$|Gilbert Pinfold is an English novelist of repute {{who at the}} age of 50 {{can look}} back on a varied life that has {{included}} a dozen reasonably successful books, wide travel, and honourable service in the Second World War. His reputation secure, he lives quietly, on good but not close terms with his neighbours; his Roman Catholicism sets him slightly apart in the local community. He has a pronounced distaste for most aspects of modern life, and has of late become somewhat lazy, given to drinking more than he should. To counter the effects of his several aches and pains, Pinfold <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> dosing himself with a powerful sedative of chloral and bromide. He conceals this practice from his doctor.|$|E

He <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> gambling, as Marsh, who employs him as a bone hunter, is not {{providing}} him with enough funds. Marsh lobbies the Bureau of Indian Affairs on behalf of Red Cloud, but also visits with the Geological Survey, insinuating {{that he would be}} a better leader of the USGS than Cope. After learning about Sam Smith's attempted sabotage of Cope and once again receiving no payment from Marsh, Hatcher leaves his employ. Marsh, now representing the survey, heads west with wealthy businessmen, scoffing at the financial misfortunes of Cope, whose investments have failed.|$|E

Continued showing of the prototype {{may no longer be}} an option in the near future, as GM <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> cutting funding to relieve the pressure of its financial woes. GM Heritage Center continues storing the 1989/1990 Fiero. Many of the 89/90 coupe prototypes have been demolished in a scrap yard in Australia.|$|E

The craft idea began with Esteban Perada, originally from Santiago Suchilquitongo. Originally he used them to support washers and retaining walls and car bumpers. Getting creative, he {{found a way to}} convert a tire into a toucan design to hang flowerpots, painting it bright colors. Others liked it and requested the item for their gardens. Since then he and others have created other figures such as parrots, squirrels and more, selling enough to supplement family income.|$|E

25|$|Some {{observers}} {{have suggested that}} the company should be given credit for increasing the standard of service in markets that it enters. A group of anthropologists in a study entitled Golden Arches East looked at the impact McDonald's had on East Asia and Hong Kong, in particular. When it opened in Hong Kong in 1975, McDonald's was the first restaurant to consistently offer clean restrooms, driving customers to demand the same of other restaurants and institutions. McDonald's <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> partnering up with Sinopec, the second largest oil company in the People's Republic of China, as it takes advantage of the country's growing use of personal vehicles by opening numerous drive-thru restaurants. McDonald's has opened a McDonald's restaurant and McCafé on the underground premises of the French fine arts museum, The Louvre.|$|E

Bi-Ryu and Ah-Rin show up {{just in time to}} save her, though she shows no fear towards the man. He believes her to be a mute, as she has not spoken since he abducted her. Later, after meeting Bi Ryu's Party she speaks slowly with future predictions, accurately predicting Yhun Ah-Rin kicking Bi Ryu. It is also known that she apparently is wanted, as a group of assassins intrude upon Bi-Ryu's party and attempt to kill them to take Nirvana. She seems to like Cho Ryung, as she hugs her like a stuffed animal a lot (She's also {{the only one who can}} understand what Cho Ryung says). She carries the memory of the former heads of Myung Wong Shin Gyo, Parvati.|$|E

Even the word [...] "Illmatic" [...] itself [...] became synonymous with anything surprisingly excellent, street-born and/or out of left field." [...] In 2013, music writer Jeff Weiss commented on the extensive vernacular usage of Illmatic, writing: [...] "The phrases and images are so deeply rooted in rap consciousness to have become cliché. Over the last 19 years, a million secret handshakes and scratched hooks have been executed to lines from Illmatic." ...|$|E

Punk, however, later changed CM into a pseudo-acronym, declaring that it has no meaning, though when asked since he <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> making up meanings that fit {{the initials}}, {{going so far as to}} make up long stories to explain the origins that do not match the actual origin story at all.

500|$|Minor restorations {{have already}} begun; two Palmyrene funerary busts of a {{deceased}} {{man and a}} woman, damaged and defaced by ISIL, were taken from Palmyra, then to Beirut to be sent off to Rome. Italian experts restored the portraits using 3D technology to print resin prosthetics, which were coated with {{a thick layer of}} stone dust to blend in with the original stone; the prosthetics were attached to the damaged faces of the busts using strong magnets. The restored pieces are now back in Syria. Abdulkarim said the restoration of the busts [...] "is the first real, visible positive step that the international community <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> protect Syrian heritage". In July 2017, the discoverer of Ebla, Paolo Matthiae, speaking in the [...] "Faces of Palmyra" [...] ("I Volti de Palmyra") exhibition in Aquileia, said that: [...] "The archaeological site of Palmyra is a vast field of ruins and only 20-30% of it is seriously damaged. Unfortunately these included important parts, such as the Temple of Bel, while the Arc of Triumph can be rebuilt." [...] He added: [...] "In any case, by using both traditional methods and advanced technologies, {{it might be possible to}} restore 98% of the site".|$|E

500|$|Ordynov {{develops}} {{a passion for}} Katerina, which she reciprocates after nursing him through delirium. While in delirium Ordynov, in dream or reality, spies on Murin who <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> his bed through illness and is recounting tales to Katerina [...] he rushes into Murin's room; Murin's attempt to shoot Ordynov with a gun, misses. Ordynov tries to convince Katerina of her need to detach herself from Murin physically and psychologically, and believes he has overcome her reluctance to do so when he hears her sing a song of love and freedom. Katerina offers wine to Ordynov and Murin as she considers her choice. Murin uses the language of prediction and psychology to show any choice as futile, as Katerina is predestined by her sex to be a captive of a master and her own grief. Ordynov now fully believes that Murin is a sorcerer and that Katerina is his slave, as she herself believes. Using Murin's argument, he offers to buy Katerina, to effect her liberation. Murin indicates a veiled threat that the price would be bloodshed for both buyer and goods. Fearing a lost cause, Ordynov intends to kill Murin, but fails as a knife falls from his hand and as Katerina falls at her husband's feet.|$|E
500|$|Oasis {{went on to}} {{have greater}} success with their next two singles, [...] "Wonderwall" [...] and [...] "Don't Look Back in Anger" [...] {{charting}} at number two and number one respectively; the former becoming their sole top 10 hit in the US. Originally, Noel had wanted to take lead vocals on [...] "Wonderwall", but Liam insisted on singing it. As compensation, he decided he would sing lead vocals on [...] "Don't Look Back in Anger". 1995 also saw Gallagher play two songs for the charity album Help! : [...] "Fade Away", accompanied by friend and Oasis fan Johnny Depp and Depp's then-girlfriend Kate Moss; and the Beatles' 1969 hit [...] "Come Together", along with Paul Weller, Paul McCartney and others in a supergroup called Smokin' Mojo Filters. He began collaborating with the Chemical Brothers, Ian Brown, the Stands, the Prodigy and Weller, amongst others. Gallagher became so influential that a June 1996 NME article argued that [...] "If Noel Gallagher, the most successful songwriter of his generation, champions a group, then said group are guaranteed more mainstream kudos and, quite possibly, more sales. And since Noel <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> championing only five or six groups, then it's a powerful cabal he's promoting." [...] The NME article grouped the bands Gallagher praised, including The Boo Radleys, Ocean Colour Scene, and Cast, {{under the banner of}} [...] "Noelrock". John Harris typified these bands, and Gallagher, of sharing [...] "a dewy-eyed love of the 1960s, a spurning of much beyond rock's most basic ingredients, and a belief in the supremacy of 'real music'".|$|E
