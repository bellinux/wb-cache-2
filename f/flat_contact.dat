5000|$|Surface Finish - Thermal {{radiation}} of {{heat sinks}} {{is a function}} of surface finish, especially at higher temperatures. A painted surface will have a greater emissivity than a bright, unpainted one. The effect is most remarkable with flat-plate heat sinks, where about one-third of the heat is dissipated by radiation. Moreover, a perfectly <b>flat</b> <b>contact</b> area allows the use of a thinner layer of thermal compound, which will reduce the thermal resistance between the heat sink and LED source. On the other hand, anodizing or etching will also decrease the thermal resistance.|$|E
5000|$|... "Schuko" [...] is a {{registered}} trademark referring {{to a system of}} AC power plugs and sockets that is defined as [...] "CEE 7/3" [...] (sockets) and [...] "CEE 7/4" [...] (plugs). A Schuko plug features two round pins of 4.8 mm diameter (19 mm long, centers 19 mm apart) for the line and neutral contacts, plus two <b>flat</b> <b>contact</b> areas on the top and bottom side of the plug for protective earth (ground). The socket (which is often, in error, also referred to as CEE 7/4) has a predominantly circular recess which is 17.5 mm deep with two symmetrical round apertures and two earthing clips {{on the sides of the}} socket positioned to ensure that the earth is always engaged before live pin contact is made. Schuko plugs and sockets are symmetric AC connectors. They can be mated in two ways, therefore line can be connected to either pin of the appliance plug. As with most types of European sockets, Schuko sockets can accept Europlugs. Schuko plugs are considered a very safe design when used with Schuko sockets, but they can also mate with other sockets to give an unsafe result.|$|E

40|$|The capsid of flock house {{virus is}} {{composed}} of 180 copies of a single type of coat protein which forms a T 53 icosahedral shell. High-resolution structural analysis {{has shown that the}} protein subunits, although chemi-cally identical, form different contacts across the twofold axes of the virus particle. Subunits that are related by icosahedral twofold symmetry form <b>flat</b> <b>contacts,</b> whereas subunits that are related by quasi-twofold symmetry form bent <b>contacts.</b> The <b>flat</b> <b>contacts</b> are due to the presence of ordered genomic RNA and an ordered peptide arm which is inserted in the groove between the subunits and prevents them from forming the dihedral angle observed at the bent quasi-twofold contacts. We hypothesized that by deleting the residues that constitute the ordered peptide arm, formation of <b>flat</b> <b>contacts</b> should be impossible and therefore result in assembly of particles with only bent contacts. Such particles would have T 51 symmetry. To test this hypothesis we generated two deletion mutants in which either 50 or 31 residues were eliminated from the N terminus of the coat protein. We found that in the absence of residues 1 to 50, assembly was completely inhibited, presumably because the mutation removed a cluster of positively charged amino acids required for neutral-ization of encapsidated RNA. When the deletion was restricted to residues 1 to 31, assembly occurred, but the products were highly heterogeneous. Small bacilliform-like structures and irregular structures as well as wild-type-like T 53 particles were detected. The anticipated T 51 particles, on the other hand, were no...|$|R

40|$|Fiber {{reinforced}} composite springs {{have been}} considered as viable replacements for steel springs in the automotive industry. Although such composites have higher energy storage capacity than steel, they have, in general, poor resistance against shear stresses [and so require different spring geometry and design]. To exploit fully the potential of composite springs with extended <b>flat</b> <b>contact</b> surfaces, {{it is necessary to}} characterize spring constants in the other two directions and under different loading configurations. Theoretical expressions based on the principle of minimum potential energy are presented which describe the stiffnesses of mid-surface symmetric, woven composite circular springs with extended <b>flat</b> <b>contact</b> surfaces subject to unidirectional line and surface-loading configurations.

Influence of angular displacement amplitudes and normal loads on torsional fretting were investigated under flat on <b>flat</b> <b>contact.</b> Friction torque versus angular displacement amplitudes and friction torque versus number of cycle curves were {{used to analyze the}} fretting kinetics behavior. Evolution of accumulated dissipated energy (ET) and wear volume (VW) with the change of angular displacement amplitudes were analyzed. The wear mechanisms were studied base on examinations under optical microscope (OM), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX). It is found that ET and VW analysis helps to reveal the variation of failure mechanisms with the change of angular displacement amplitudes. Uneven spread of wear scar under mixed slip resulted from the effects of debris on stress-redistribution. Similar to ball on <b>flat</b> <b>contact,</b> the torsional fretting wear mechanism under flat on <b>flat</b> <b>contact</b> was a combination of deformation, cracks, delamination abrasive wear and oxidation wear...|$|E
40|$|Using a {{coarse-grained}} molecular model {{we study}} the {{spatial distribution of}} lipid domains on a 20 -nm-sized vesicle. The lipid mixture laterally phase separates into a raftlike, liquid-ordered (l(o)) phase and a liquid-disordered phase. As we uniaxially compress the mixed vesicle keeping the enclosed volume constant, we impart tension onto the membrane. The vesicle adopts a barrel shape, which is composed of two <b>flat</b> <b>contact</b> zones and a curved edge. The l(o) domain, which exhibits a higher bending rigidity, segregates to the highly curved edge. This inverted domain sorting switches to normal domain sorting, where the l(o) domain prefers the <b>flat</b> <b>contact</b> zone, when we release {{the contents of the}} vesicle.

When an 8P8C plug is mated with an 8P8C jack, the contacts meet and create an electrical connection. Spring tension in the jack's contacts ensures a good interface with the plug and allows for slight travel during insertion and removal.|$|R
40|$|Summary Nominally <b>flat</b> <b>contacts</b> are {{representative}} of various components like blade/disk contacts in aircraft engines. In literature, there are only numerical solutions for this class of plane contact problems under partial reverse slip conditions, when bulk stress is applied. A general shear traction distribution based on boundary conditions and the direction of slip in slip zone has been proposed to obtain closed form solution for this problem. To obtain the closed form solution for specific problem of <b>flat</b> base in <b>contact</b> with a nominally flat punch, pressure distribution had to be approximated to evaluate some integrals. An appropriate approximation valid for all ratios of flat length to edge radii has been proposed. Deviations in shear traction distribution due to this approximation {{was found to be}} very small.

The study of contact manifolds, from a global point of view, has been developed in the last 50 years, starting {{from the work of}} G. Reeb on properties of the trajectories of dynamical systems. The contact structures find applications in analytic mechanics and in the quantization theory of B. Kostant and J. -M. Souriau. S.

40|$|The {{fretting}} phenomena {{caused by}} small scale reciprocating motion. It causes failure through wear loss and fatigue cracking {{and is one}} of the leading causes of breakdown in industrial machinery. Due to the small amplitude of the fretting motion wear particles are not immediately ejected from the contact but build up to form a 2 ̆ 2 third body 2 ̆ 2 separating the surfaces. A number of methods are used protect components from fretting damage but some of these measures are harmful under certain conditions. The purpose of this study is to develop an experimental rig and numerical model to study fretting wear and use these tools to quantitatively analyze the effectiveness of coatings under high temperature conditions. A fretting wear test rig (FWTR) was designed and constructed to study Hertzian point contacts which quickly eject wear particles and <b>flat</b> on <b>flat</b> <b>contacts</b> which tend to retain them. The FWTR allows elevated temperatures, in situ observation of wear debris, and evaluation of wear coefficients. A combined finite discrete element model (FDEM) in which multiple finite element bodies interact as distinct bodies was developed to study fretting wear using the Archard and dissipated energy approaches. The FDEM has the unique ability to study systems containing large numbers of deformable bodies. The FDEM is used to analyze the effect of coating parameters including modulus of elasticity, coefficient of friction, and thickness on fretting wear in Hertzian line and <b>flat</b> on <b>flat</b> <b>contacts.</b> The FWTR and FDEM are used to compare and evaluate the Archard and dissipated energy equations for modeling and predicting wear. An efficient wear mapping method drawing upon both theories is presented for quantifying the fretting resistance of a contact across a wide range of conditions. ...|$|R
