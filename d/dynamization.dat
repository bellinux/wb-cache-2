The isotherapics were prepared by Hahnemannian method until 12 CH, starting from the suspension of purulent secretions in diluted glycerin, with standardized turbidity (Grade 3 on Mac Farland Scale). Three batteries of tests were prepared: I) All the <b>dynamizations</b> using as inert substance diluted glycerin; II) All the <b>dynamizations</b> using as inert substance alcohol 70 % (p/p); III) <b>dynamizations</b> from 1 to 3 CH – diluted glycerin and from 4 to 12 CH – alcohol 70 % (p/p).

In the ten researched samples it was observed the following results: Battery I – There was bacterial growing until 5 CH; beginning with 6 CH the cultures were negative; Battery II – There was growing until 3 CH; beginning with 4 CH the cultures were negative; Battery III – any growing was observed. The results obtained reveal the innocuity of diluted glycerin over microorganisms in dynamized purulent secretions, because the bacterial growing didn’t occur only when the concentration of 0, 003 UFC/ml was surpassed.

40|$|Recent {{cultural}} {{theory has}} paid increasing {{attention to the}} category of space. What has received less attention, however, are ideas of navigation through space. From a media scientific viewpoint, maps as a representation of space have {{played a central role}} since the very early stages of the creation of spatial information systems. The relevance of maps has also been revitalised in recent years through new computer visualizations and <b>dynamizations</b> of cartographic imagery which has led to the establishment of "mobile cartography" as a novel topic for research. This paper argues that future developments resulting from convergence in geography, media and communication technologies can be inferred based on the increasing phenomenon of car navigation systems. But this new subject matter for social geographic research may itself become superseded, because future GPS-based localization will operate with greatly reduced symbolic sign systems. The newest mobile positioning applications no longer direct the car driver through traffic by simply using arrows, but represent the environment true to reality. On the monitor of these navigation systems, based on "augmented reality", the user sees the world and the road ahead from the same point of view as it is seen from the driver's seat. The "conversion" of abstract maps by the driver is no longer applicable. In addition, "augmented reality" in combination with a head-up display can ensure that drivers are looking straight at their route, displayed directly onto the windshield. The constitutional moment of this medium is the constant oscillation between environmental space and two-dimensional projection space. The new generation of navigation systems therefore result in concrete manifestation of what Edward Soja (1999) describes as the rise of the perspective of a third space. The driver himself is in the first space and through the windscreen sees a first space that can be experienced physically. Via the head-up display, a second space is simultaneously projected before his eyes as a mental concept of space. These spaces, when overlaid and integrated into each other, represent something like a "both/and" instead of an "either/or" through this hybridity, mobility and simultaneity. Such a complex understanding of space opens up new spaces...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Surgeons {{agree on}} the {{benefits}} of operative treatment of tibial fractures – the most common of long bone fractures – with an intramedullary rod or nail. Rates of re-operation remain high – between 23 % and 60 % in prior trials – and the two alternative nailing approaches, reamed or non-reamed, each have a compelling biological rationale and strong proponents, resulting in ongoing controversy regarding which is better. Methods/Design The objective of this trial was {{to assess the impact of}} reamed versus non-reamed intramedullary nailing on rates of re-operation in patients with open and closed fractures of the tibial shaft. The study to prospectively evaluate reamed intramedullary nails in tibial fractures (S. P. R. I. N. T) was a multi-center, randomized trial including 29 clinical sites in Canada, the United States and the Netherlands which enrolled 1200 skeletally mature patients with open (Gustilo Types I-IIIB) or closed (Tscherne Types 0 – 3) fractures of the tibial shaft amenable to surgical treatment with an intramedullary nail. Patients received a statically locked intramedullary nail with either reamed or non-reamed insertion. The first strategy involved fixation of the fracture with an intramedullary nail following reaming to enlarge the intramedullary canal (Reamed Group). The second treatment strategy involved fixation of the fracture with an intramedullary nail without prior reaming of the intramedullary canal (Non-Reamed Group). Patients, outcome assessors, and data analysts were blinded to treatment allocation. Peri-operative care was standardized, and re-operations before 6 months were proscribed. Patients were followed at discharge, 2 weeks post-discharge, and at 6 weeks, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post surgery. A committee, blinded to allocation, adjudicated all outcomes. Discussion The primary outcome was re-operation to promote healing, treat infection, or preserve the limb (fasciotomy for compartment syndrome after nailing). The primary outcome was a composite comprising the following re-operations: bone grafts, implant exchanges, and <b>dynamizations,</b> in patients with fracture gaps less than 1 cm post intramedullary nail insertion. Infections and fasciotomies were considered events irrespective of the fracture gap. We planned a priori to conduct a subgroup analysis of outcomes in patients with open and closed fractures. S. P. R. I. N. T is the largest collaborative trial evaluating alternative orthopaedic surgical interventions in patients with tibial shaft fractures. The methodological rigor will set new benchmarks for future trials in the field and its results will have important impact on patient care. The S. P. R. I. N.

40|$|SummaryIntroductionIntramedullary (IM) nailing is the {{classical}} treatment for diaphyseal fractures of the tibia. Stabilizing fractures of the distal quarter {{is recognized as}} being delicate. We report a continuous, multicenter prospective study of distal tibia-fibula fractures treated with anterograde intramedullary nailing. HypothesisThe working hypothesis was to identify the problems encountered with IM nailing alone of distal leg fractures. Patients and methodsFrom May 2007 to November 2008, 51 fractures in 51 patients (19 females and 32 males; mean age, 46. 2  years [range, 17 – 93  years]) were treated with IM nailing. The fractures were classified according to the association pour l’ostéosynthèse (AO) classification, with most type A 1 (29 / 51). Thirteen fractures presented a distal articular extension treated with screws in five cases. Fixation consisted in intramedullary nailing, reamed in all cases, performed on a standard or orthopaedic surgery table. Nailing was static and distally locked (50 / 51). The patients were evaluated clinically and radiologically, with AP and lateral images of both legs and the Olerud score. ResultsWe report one death and eight patients lost to follow-up, providing 42 cases to reviewing at 1  year. The bone union rate was 97. 6 % in a mean 15. 7  weeks. Immediately after surgery, 14 axial deviations greater than 5 ° were observed, mainly valgus, with only one greater than 10 °. The absence of fibular fixation was the only identifiable risk factor for appearance of an initial axial deviation as well as fracture instability over time. Two infections were observed and at 6  months four secondary displacements, one {{of which can be}} explained by changing the distal locking due to infection. Four <b>dynamizations</b> were performed. No other risk factor was found. The mean Olerud functional score at 12  months was 83. 5 points. DiscussionThe clinical results are comparable to those reported in the literature. From a radiological point of view, the rates and times to bone union were identical. However, the rates of malunion were clearly higher. The risk factors for malunion found in the literature are metaphyseal enlargement, fracture comminution, a too distal location of fracture site, young patient age, patient installation on a standard operating table, and technical errors. The absence of supplementary fibular fixation, the subject of debate in the literature, was the only statistically significant point found in the present study. Nailing distal fractures of the leg provides good clinical results. However, with regard to the malunion rates, the technique must be precise and rigorous. We recommend systematic fibular fixation and use of an orthopaedic table. Level of evidence: Level IV; cohort type prospective study...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Open {{fractures}} frequently {{result in}} serious complications for patients, including infections, wound healing problems, and failure of fracture healing, {{many of which}} necessitate subsequent operations. One {{of the most important}} steps in the initial management of open fractures is a thorough wound irrigation and debridement to remove any contaminants. There is, however, currently no consensus regarding the optimal approach to irrigating open fracture wounds during the initial operative procedure. The selection of both the type of irrigating fluid and the pressure of fluid delivery remain controversial. The primary objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the effects of irrigation solutions (soap vs. normal saline) and pressure (low vs. high; gravity flow vs. high; low vs. gravity flow) on re-operation within one year among patients with open fractures. Methods/Design The FLOW study is a multi-center, randomized controlled trial using a 2 × 3 factorial design. Surgeons at clinical sites in North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia will recruit 2 280 patients who will be centrally randomized into one of the 6 treatment arms (soap + low pressure; soap + gravity flow pressure; soap + high pressure; saline + low pressure; saline + gravity flow pressure; saline + high pressure). The primary outcome of the study is re-operation to promote wound or bone healing, or to treat an infection. This composite endpoint of re-operation includes a narrow spectrum of patient-important procedures: irrigation and debridement for infected wound, revision and closure for wound dehiscence, wound coverage procedures for infected or necrotic wound, bone grafts or implant exchange procedures for established nonunion in patients with postoperative fracture gaps less than 1 cm, intramedullary nail <b>dynamizations</b> in the operating room, and fasciotomies for compartment syndrome. Patients, outcome adjudicators, and data analysts will be blinded. We will compare rates of re-operation at 12 months across soap vs. saline, low pressure vs. high pressure, gravity flow pressure vs. high pressure, and low pressure vs. gravity flow pressure. We will measure function and quality of life with the Short Form- 12 (SF- 12) and the EuroQol- 5 Dimensions (EQ- 5 D) at baseline, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months after initial surgical management, and measure patients' illness beliefs with the Somatic Pre-Occupation and Coping (SPOC) questionnaire at 1 and 6 weeks. We will also compare non-operatively managed infections, wound healing, and fracture healing problems at 12 months after initial surgery. Discussion This study represents a major international effort to identify a simple and easily applicable strategy for emergency wound management. The importance of the question and the potential to identify a low cost treatment strategy argues strongly for global participation, especially in low and middle income countries such as India and China where disability from traumatic injuries is substantial.

40|$|Background <b>Dynamization</b> {{involves}} {{a reduction in}} fixa-tion construct stiffness during bone healing, allowing increased interfragmentary movement of the fracture through physiologic weightbearing and muscle contraction. Within some optimal range, interfragmentary movement stimulates healing, but this range likely varies across stages of bone healing. Questions/purposes How does the time of <b>dynamization</b> affect the cartilage formation, bony bridging, and bone resorption in a rat fracture-healing model? Methods Unilateral external fixators, stabilizing a 1 -mm gap, were dynamized at 1 (D 1 group, n = 10), 3 (D 3 group, n = 11), or 4 (D 4 group, n = 11) weeks postoper-atively. Continuously 5 weeks stiff (S group, n = 10) and flexible (F group, n = 11) fixation were included for comparison. After 5 weeks, healing was evaluated by his-tomorphometric methods. Results Advanced healing, indicated by less cartilage and a greater rate of bony bridging, was observed in the S group compared to the D 1 or F group. In contrast, the D 3 and D 4 groups had less cartilage and more bridging compared to the S group. Also, the S group had less cortical resorption than the F and D 1 groups. Conclusions These data suggest late <b>dynamization</b> {{at the onset of}} bony bridging led to enhanced healing, whereas <b>dynamization</b> at the early stage of cartilage differentiation delayed healing. Clinical Relevance Although our observations from this small-animal study cannot be directly transferred to humans, these data suggest, once bony bridging begins, <b>dynamization</b> may stimulate bone healing and accelerate remodeling...|$|E

ApÃs a embebiÃÃo, as sementes foram semeadas nos vasos. Nos experimentos com a lagarta-do-cartucho, alÃm do tratamento de semente (a), as dinamizaÃÃes 12, 36, 60 e 84 CH (ordem {{centesimal}} hahnemaniana) de Silicea foram aplicadas em pulverizaÃÃo (b) ou irrigaÃÃo (c), sendo a primeira aplicaÃÃo logo apÃs a emergÃncia, a segunda no estÃdio V 2 e a terceira no estÃdio V 3 das plantas. SecÃÃes foliares das plantas em estÃgio V 6 oriundas do respectivo tratamento foram diariamente fornecidas Ãs lagartas individualizadas em tubos de ensaio e mantidas em sala de desenvolvimento em 25 Â 3 ÂC e fotoperÃodo 14 horas. Foram avaliados o consumo das folhas, formaÃÃo e razÃo sexual de pupas e adultos, fertilidade, fecundidade, longevidade de adultos e preferÃncia alimentar em ensaio de livre escolha. Para experimentos com o percevejo barriga-verde, D. melacanthus, preparado homeopÃtico Nux vomica tambÃm foi aplicado via tratamento de semente (a) nas dinamizaÃÃes 12, 36, 60 e 84 DH (ordem decimal de Hering) e combinado com pulverizaÃÃo (b) ou irrigaÃÃo (c), sendo iniciados dez dias apÃs a semeadura e seguidas no intervalo de trÃs dias atÃ o 22 Â dia apÃs a semeadura, totalizando cinco aplicaÃÃes. Cinco dias apÃs a Ãltima aplicaÃÃo dos tratamentos foram avaliados massa fresca e seca de parte aÃrea e de raÃzes, volume das raÃzes, comprimento da raiz primÃria, altura e diÃmetro do colmo das plantas de milho. No sexto dia apÃs a Ãltima aplicaÃÃo dos tratamentos, as parcelas rÃplicas foram submetidas ao estresse pelo inseto. As plantas de milho foram infestadas com um percevejo D. melacanthus por 36 horas. Dez dias apÃs a retirada do percevejo foi realizada a classificaÃÃo plantas atacadas atravÃs de escala de notas de dano. A anÃlise dos dados mostrou que plantas de milho pulverizadas ou irrigadas com Silicea 36 CH interferiram no consumo e utilizaÃÃo do alimento, alÃm de proporcionarem maior quantidade de pupas e adultos de S. frugiperda deformados. Plantas pulverizadas ou irrigadas no solo com Silicea 36 CH tambÃm interferiram na fertilidade e fecundidade de S. frugiperda proporcionando menor perÃodo de oviposiÃÃo e pÃs-reprodutivo, menor nÃmero de massas de ovos, ovos por postura e ovos por fÃmea. Os resultados sugerem que lagartas de S. frugiperda tÃm dificuldade ao se alimentarem de plantas de milho pulverizadas ou irrigadas com Silicea 36 CH. Plantas de milho tratadas com o preparado homeopÃtico Silicea em 36 CH aplicado atravÃs de pulverizaÃÃo na parte aÃrea ou por irrigaÃÃo no solo interferiram na alimentaÃÃo e, conseqÃentemente, na fertilidade e fecundidade de S. frugiperda, reduzindo assim, a populaÃÃo do inseto. O mÃtodo de aplicaÃÃo do preparado homeopÃtico Nux vomica mais adequado para a cultura do milho foi atravÃs da irrigaÃÃo no solo. Nux vomica na 33, 36 e 38 DH irrigado ao solo favoreceu o desenvolvimento inicial de parte aÃrea e raÃzes de plantas de milho.

Conventional control strategies have been ineffective so far. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of homeopathic preparations {{on the development of}} S. frugiperda and D. melacanthus in corn plants. To study the consumption of fall armyworm S. frugiperda seeds were treated before planting by soaking in distilled water and homeopathic preparations at a dose of 1 mL. L- 1. After soaking, the seeds were sown in pots. In experiments with fall armyworm in addition to the seed treatment (a), the <b>dynamizations</b> 12, 36, 60 and 84 CH (centesimal hahnemaniana) of Silicea were applied in spraying (b) or irrigation (c), with an first application was made just after emergence, the second in V 2 stage, and the third application in V 3 stage of corn plants. Leaf sections of plants at V 6 stage derived from the respective treatment were provided daily to caterpillars in individualized test tubes and maintained in the development room at 25 Â 3 ÂC and 14 hours photoperiod. Were evaluated consumption of leaves, formation and sex ratio of pupae and adults, fertility, fecundity, longevity of adult and food preference in free choice test. For the experiment with green-belly stink bug, D. melacanthus, homeopathic preparations Nux vomica was also applied as seed treatment (a) the <b>dynamizations</b> 12, 36, 60 and 84 DH (decimal order of Hering) and combined with spraying (b) or irrigation (c), and started ten days after sowing and followed within three days until the 22 th day after sowing, totaling five applications. Five days after the last application, fresh and dry mass of shoots and roots, root volume, primary root length, height and stem diameter of corn plants were evaluated. On the sixth day after the last treatment, the plots replicas were subjected to stress by the insect. Corn plants were infested with a D. melacanthus bug for 36 hours. Ten days after removal of the bug, the classification of attacked plants was performed through a rating scale of damage. Data analysis showed that corn plants sprayed or irrigated with 36 CH Silicea interfered in the consumption and utilization of food. In addition, it provided greater amount of pupae and adults of deformed S. frugiperda. Plants sprayed or irrigated on soil with 36 CH Silicea also interfered with fertility and fecundity of S. frugiperda, providing shorter oviposition and post-reproductive periods, as well as fewer egg masses, eggs per ovoposition and eggs per female. The results suggest that larvae of S. frugiperda have difficulty while feeding on corn plants sprayed or irrigated with 36 CH Silicea. Corn plants treated with 36 CH Silicea homeopathic preparation, applied by spraying the shoots or by irrigating the soil, interfered with the feeding and, therefore, with fertility and fecundity of S. frugiperda, reducing insect population. The method of application of homeopathic preparations Nux vomica more suitable for the corn crop was in the through irrigation on soil. Nux vomica at 33, 36 and 38 DH irrigated to soil favored the early development of shoots and roots of corn plants. Corn plants irrigated Nux vomica 36 and 38 DH were not damaged by green-belly stink bug D. melacanthus, showing the effect of repellency or not food preferenc...|$|R
40|$|As altas diluições aplicadas {{conforme}} os princípios da homeopatia ou da hormese são alternativas sustentáveis de baixo custo na agricultura, podendo ser usadas para melhorar a qualidade das águas. Foram conduzidos quatro experimentos no Laboratório de Homeopatia do Departamento de Fitotecnia da Universidade Federal de Viçosa. Objetivou-se investigar a alteração das propriedades físico-químicas de água em resposta à ação de altas diluições de Alumina e Calcarea carbonica no delineamento inteiramente casualizado com sete tratamentos (3 CH, 5 CH, 7 CH, 9 CH, 11 CH e 13 CH e água destilada, como testemunha) e quatro repetições. As dinamizações foram preparadas em água destilada e aplicadas no procedimento duplo-cego. Cinquenta e seis frascos de vidro borossilicato com capacidade para 80 mL receberam 40 mL de água destilada, sendo 28 no primeiro experimento e 28 no segundo. Cinquenta e seis frascos de vidro borossilicato com capacidade para 80 mL receberam 40 mL de água ácida. Em 28 desses, foram aplicadas 10 gotas da Alumina, enquanto nos 28 restantes, 10 gotas da Calcarea carbonica. As variáveis avaliadas foram: potencial de hidrogênio, condutividade elétrica (em &# 956;S/cm) e oxigênio dissolvido (em mg/L), medidas imediatamente após a aplicação dos tratamentos (T 1) e em intervalos de 24 horas até 72 horas após (T 2, T 3, T 4). Os dados foram interpretados por meio de análise de variância, sendo utilizado o Programa SAEG. A testemunha foi comparada com os demais tratamentos pelo teste de Dunnett a 5 % de probabilidade. A Alumina 3 CH na água destilada elevou o potencial de hidrogênio e a condutividade elétrica, a Alumina 7 CH reduziu o oxigênio dissolvido, a Calcarea carbonica 5 CH e a 7 CH elevaram o potencial de hidrogênio da água destilada, a 7 CH aumentou o oxigênio dissolvido e a 9 CH e 13 CH reduziram-no. No tratamento da acidez da água causada por alumínio, a Calcarea carbonica foi eficiente e a Alumina não.

The <b>dynamizations</b> were prepared in distilled water, and were applied in the procedure "double blind". Fifty-six bottles of borosilicate glass with a capacity of 80 mL received 40 mL of distilled water, and twenty-eight in the first experiment and twenty-eight in the second. Fifty-six bottles of borosilicate glass with a capacity of 80 mL received 40 mL of acidic water. In twenty-eight of these were applied 10 drops of Alumina in the remaining twenty-eight were applied 10 drops of Calcarea carbonica. The variables were: potential of hydrogen, electrical conductivity (in &# 956;S/cm) and dissolved oxygen (mg/L), measured immediately after treatment (T 1) and every 24 hours until 72 hours after (T 2, T 3, T 4).

The knowledge acquired in homeopathic science is experimental research on healthy living organisms that are undergoing experimentation using homeopathic medicines [2]. The experimental research on homeopathic plants has been performed in Europe, Mexico, India and Brazil, proving that the principle of homeopathy, as set out in the animal kingdom has been found in plants [3]. This experiment aimed to evaluate the effect of the homeopathic Arsenicum album in decimal (x) and centesimal (cH) scale on the physiological variables of the germination and growth of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) subjected to {{accelerated aging}}. &# 13; &# 13; Materials and methods: The experiment was conducted at the Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Homeopathy, Universidade Estadual de MaringÃƒÂ¡ - UEM. Arsenicum album 6 x and 2 CH matrices were acquired in homeopathic pharmacy. From matrices were prepared further <b>dynamizations</b> in decimal (x) and centesimal (C) scale, according to the Brazilian Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia [4]. In the accelerated aging test were used samples of 200 seeds per treatment distributed evenly forming a single layer on the surfaces of metal wire suspended inside the plastic box containing inside 40 ml of Arsenicum album (9, 12, 18, or 30 x 24 and 9, 12, 18, 24 or 30 C). The control consisted of distilled water. The boxes were placed in BOD-chamber adjusted to 42 Ã‚Â°C and relative humidity 100 % for 96 hours. After this period, led to the germination test, using four replicates of 50 seeds, totalizing 52 experimental units which were placed on germination paper previously soaked with distilled water in an amount equivalent to 2. 5 times the paper weight[5]. The rolls were arranged randomly in the BOD-chamber at 25 Ã‚Â°CÃ‚Â± 2. The interpretation of the test was performed after seven days [6]. Germination percentage (% PG) was determined according to the Rules for Seed Analysis [5]. The length of primary roots (PRL) and hypocotyl (LH) were only performed in normal seedlings. The total length of the radicle (TLR) was calculated as the sum of the lengths of hypocotyl and primary root. The experimental design was completely randomized. We adopted the double-blind procedure, avoiding possible interference from the researcher. Data were subjected to analysis of variance and means compared by Scott-Knott test (P Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0. 05). &# 13; &# 13; Results: Arsenicum album 9 x, 9 CH and 12 CH reduced the percentage of germination (%PG) (Figure 1 A). The highest values in the length of hypocotyl (LH) Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã¢â‚¬â€¹were observed in 12 and 24 x dilutions, followed by a reduction in intermediate and higher inhibition at 30 x and 9 x. The 18 x does not differ from control. All centesimal dilution presented effect on the variable analyzed. There was an increase in hypocotyl length in the 12, 18 and 24 dilutions, and reduction in 9 and 30 cH dilutions (Figure 1 B). The primary root length (PRL) of sorghum was increased in dilutions 18 and 30 x. However, the centesimal dilutions were not different from control (Figure 1 C). There was an increase in the total length of the seedlings (TLS) in the dilutions 18, 24 and 30 x and reduction in 9 x when compared to control. As for centesimal dilutions, there was an effect only in 18 cH. The other centesimal dilutions were not different from control (Figure 1 D). &# 13; &# 13; Conclusions: In general, homeopathic preparations did not affect the germination percentage except for 9 x, and 9 cH 12 cH dilution. Furthermore, the dilutions reduced the effects on premature aging verified by high values Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã¢â‚¬â€¹of growth variables. These results suggest that high dilution Arsenicum album can be an alternative to minimize the deleterious effect to high temperature...|$|R

40|$|Tratamentos alternativos para a depressão humana vêm sendo realizados pela homeopatia e fitoterapia, por meio do Hypericum perforatum (Hp), dinamizado ou extrato, respectivamente. Experimentalmente, o desamparo aprendido é proposto como modelo animal de depressão, o que permite seu uso para o teste de substâncias potencialmente antidepressivas. Assim, foram realizados dois experimentos para verificar se o Hp em preparação homeopática e fitoterápica impediriam o desamparo aprendido em animais. No Experimento 1, foram utilizados 96 ratos Wistar, machos, distribuídos em doze grupos (n= 8), expostos às fases choque e teste, separadas por 24 h. Os grupos foram manipulados em tríades, tratados com choques (60, 1, 0 mA, VT 60 s, 10 s máx.) controláveis (C), incontroláveis (I) ou nenhum choque (N). Após esse tratamento, as tríades receberam 5 gotas, v. o. de: Hp 30 CH, Hp 200 CH e 0 CH (veículo - solução hidroalcóolica a 5 %), três vezes, com intervalo de 0, 19 e 23 h após o término da fase choque. A quarta tríade não recebeu substância (sd) e foi utilizada para comparação em ambos os experimentos. No teste, todos os sujeitos foram submetidos a uma contingência de fuga, com 30 choques, semelhantes aos anteriores, em uma shuttlebox. No Experimento 2, foram utilizados 72 ratos com as mesmas características, distribuídos em nove grupos (n= 8). Os equipamentos foram os mesmos e o procedimento foi semelhante ao do Experimento 1, com diferença apenas na fase de administração da droga, sendo que cada tríade recebeu extrato de Hp i. p., 1 ml/kg, nas doses: 0 mg/kg (veículo - solução hidroalcóolica a 5 %), 15 mg/kg e 30 mg/kg, 22 horas após o término da fase choque. Os resultados mostraram que apenas o Grupo I da Tríade sd apresentou desamparo aprendido. No Experimento 1, as substâncias não produziram efeito sobre os grupos N e C, enquanto os grupos I tiveram redução das latências, sendo o efeito mais significativo com Hp 200 CH. O tratamento 0 CH produziu uma pequena redução das latências gerais, embora não suficiente para abolir o desamparo. Os resultados do Experimento 2 mostraram que os grupos N e C não sofreram efeito das substâncias, enquanto os grupos I tiveram redução da suas latências, sendo o efeito maior com Hp 0 mg/kg. Esses resultados sugerem que o veículo não era farmacologicamente inerte, comprometendo os demais resultados do Hp. Conclui-se que os efeitos de tratamentos da homeopatia e fitoterapia precisam ser mais investigados para que uma afirmação da sua eficácia tenha mais confiabilidade. Alternative {{treatments}} {{for the human}} depression have been conducted in the homeopathy and phytoterapy, through Hypericum perforatum (Hp), dynamized or extract, respectively. Experimentally, learned helplessness is proposed as an animal model of depression, which permits its use to test the effects of potential antidepressants. Two experiments were conducted to investigate whether Hp, either in homeophatic and or in phytotherapic preparation, can prevent the occurrence of learned helplessness in animals. In the Experiment 1, 96 male Wistar rats were divided into 12 groups (n= 8) exposed to treatment and test phases, separated by 24 hours. Groups were divided into triads exposed to controllable shocks (C), uncontrollable shocks (I) or no shocks (N). After that, Hp was administered orally (five drops) to each triad {{in one of three}} <b>dynamizations</b>  30 CH, 200 CH and 0 CH (vehicle - hydroalcoholic solution 5 %)  three times: 0, 19, and 23 hours after treatment with shocks. The fourth triad didnt receive drug (sd) and it was used in both experiments. In the test phase, all the animals were exposed to an escape contingency in a shuttlebox. In the Experiment 2, 72 rats were divided into 9 groups (n= 8). Equipments were the same and procedure was similar to Experiment 1, with the exception of drug administration. Extract of Hp was administered, i. p., 1 ml/kg, in one of three concentrations for each triad  0 mg/kg (vehicle  hydroalcoholic solution 5 %), 15 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg - 22 hours after treatment with shocks. Results showed that, among the groups that were not administered pharmacological treatment, only Group I did not learn to escape, an indication of learned helplessness. In Experiment 1, among the groups that were administered Hp in homeopathic preparation, groups N and C were not affected, while response latencies for groups I decreased, with a stronger effect with 200 CH. Treatment with 0 CH caused a small reduction of general latencies, although it wasnt suficient to prevent helplessness. In Experiment 2, results showed that Hp in phytotherapic administration didnt affect groups N and C, while the latencies of Group I were reduced, with a stronger effect with Hp 0 mg/kg. These data suggest that the vehicle wasnt inert pharmacologically, which casts doubt on the results that involved Hp. In conclusion, more studies will be necessary to attest the efficacy of homeopathic and phytotherapic treatment...|$|R
40|$|Background Large {{segmental}} {{defects in}} bone do not heal well and present clinical challenges. This study investigated modulation {{of the mechanical}} environment {{as a means of}} improving bone healing in the presence of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) - 2. Although the influence of mechanical forces on the healing of fractures is well established, no previous studies, to our knowledge, have described their influence on the healing of large segmental defects. We hypothesized that bone-healing would be improved by initial, low-stiffness fixation of the defect, followed by high-stiffness fixation during the healing process. We call this reverse <b>dynamization.</b> Methods A rat model of a critical-sized femoral defect was used. External fixators were constructed to provide different degrees of stiffness and, importantly, the ability to change stiffness during the healing process in vivo. Healing of the critical-sized defects was initiated by the implantation of 11 mg of recombinant human BMP (rhBMP) - 2 on a collagen sponge. Groups of rats receiving BMP- 2 were allowed to heal with low, medium, and high-stiffness fixators, as well as under conditions of reverse <b>dynamization,</b> in which the stiffness was changed from low to high at two weeks.

40|$|Background: Reamed {{interlocking}} intramedullary nailing {{is considered}} the gold standard treatment for complex fractures of the femoral and tibial shaft. There has been some controversies about <b>dynamization</b> of statically locked nails, and some authors recommended routine <b>dynamization</b> for promotion of healing. This study aims to evaluate treatment of complex fractures in tibia and femur with static interlocking intramedullary nail method. Methods: In a retrospective study from January 2003 to April 2008, 173 patients with femoral and tibial shaft fracture that were treated with this method were enrolled. No rod was dynamized in our patients. Results: All patients with tibial fractures achieved union without any need for <b>dynamization</b> during 12 - 18 weeks (mean; 13. 4 weeks). Four patients developed delayed union but all achieved union without any intervention. In femoral fracture, all but one patient achieved complete union during 10 - 30 weeks (mean: 18. 3 weeks). One patient developed non-union who was treated by an exchange nailing and iliac bone graft method. No significant complication was observed in our patients.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Axial <b>dynamization</b> of {{fractures}} {{can promote}} healing, and overly stiff fixation can suppress healing. A novel technology, termed active plating, provides controlled axial <b>dynamization</b> by the elastic suspension of locking holes within the plate. This prospective, controlled animal study evaluated {{the effect of}} active plates on fracture-healing in an established ovine osteotomy model. We hypothesized that symmetric axial <b>dynamization</b> with active plates stimulates circumferential callus and delivers faster and stronger healing relative to standard locking plates. METHODS: Twelve sheep {{were randomly assigned to}} receive a standard locking plate or an active locking plate for stabilization of a 3 -mm tibial osteotomy gap. The only difference between plates was that locking holes of active plates were elastically suspended, allowing up to 1. 5 mm of axial motion at the fracture. Fracture-healing was analyzed weekly on radiographs. After sacrifice at nine weeks postoperatively, callus volume and distribution were assessed by computed tomography. Finally, to determine their strength, healed tibiae and contralateral tibiae were tested in torsion until failure. RESULTS: At each follow-up, the active locking plate group had more callus (p < 0. 001) than the standard locking plate group. At postoperative week 6, all active locking plate group specimens had bridging callus at the three visible cortices. In standard locking plate group specimens, only 50...|$|E
30|$|Healing was {{determined}} radiologically and clinically: radiologically, callus bridging the fracture {{site and the}} appearance of three cortices bridging the distraction corticotomy on antero-posterior and lateral radiographs indicated healing.

30|$|Nail <b>dynamization</b> {{was carried}} out at least 10 – 12  weeks postoperatively when slow or no {{progression}} to bone healing was observed. Under local anaesthesia, the farthest screw(s) from the fracture site were removed; {{the aim was to}} stimulate the local osteogenic activity through increase in axial motion.|$|E

30|$|Many {{surgeons}} {{have argued}} for the efficacy of nail <b>dynamization.</b> Georgiadis et al. [16], in a canine model study, found a beneficial effect of <b>dynamization</b> {{in the quality of}} early bone but no increase in union rate. Egger et al. [17], using the same animal model, reported an enhancement of the healing process in delayed unions of the tibia but no alteration of union rate. In the current study, the removal of locking screws from either end of the nail was associated with union in 82 % of cases. Despite the scarcity of relevant published clinical data, we advocate conversion of static fixation into a dynamic one, even several months after the index surgical procedure, with the caveat that malalignment or substantial bone loss are not present in the fracture [18].|$|E
30|$|The {{patients}} were encouraged early {{movement of the}} knee and ankle joints and muscular exercises. Axial <b>dynamization</b> and loading was individualized.

Each patient was evaluated clinically and radiographically at 1  month postoperatively and subsequently every month. Fracture healing was assessed by standard radiographic projections and union defined as dense callus bringing at least three cortices. After radiographic confirmation of union, the device was removed with the pins left in place and the {{patients were}} instructed to fully bear weight.
