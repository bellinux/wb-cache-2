5|$|After the Suez Crisis and the Six-Day War, {{the army}} came to arm the most {{important}} place. <b>For</b> <b>technical</b> reasons (distance of communication with bases) and because new places of historical interest were accessible, the top brass debated whether to transfer the postings of new recruits at Massada to a more appropriate place. It was Latrun that was finally chosen. In the 1980s, a commemorative site and a museum {{was built on the}} old police site. The complex has a wall listing all the names of the fallen soldiers since the War Of Independence, and a monument to the glory of the heroes and another for reverence.

5|$|Before {{the advent}} of the European system of {{education}} in Mysore, agraharas (Brahmin quarters) provided Vedic education to Hindus, and madrassas provided schooling for Muslims. Modern education began in Mysore when a free English school was established in 1833. Maharaja's College was founded in 1864. A high school exclusively for girls was established in 1881 and was later renamed Maharani's Women's College. The Industrial School, the first institute <b>for</b> <b>technical</b> education in the city, was established in 1892; this was followed by the Chamarajendra Technical Institute in 1913. While the modern system of education have makde inroads, colleges such as the Mysore Sanskrit Pāthaśhāla, established in 1876, still continue to provide Vedic education.|$|E
5|$|Fingerspelling {{is a form}} of borrowing, a {{linguistic}} process wherein words from one language are incorporated into another. In ASL, fingerspelling is used for proper nouns and <b>for</b> <b>technical</b> terms with no native ASL equivalent. There are also some other loan words which are fingerspelled, either very short English words or abbreviations of longer English words, e.g. O-N from English 'on', and A-P-T from English 'apartment'. Fingerspelling may also be used to emphasize a word that would normally be signed otherwise.|$|E
5|$|<b>For</b> <b>technical</b> advice, {{the journalists}} engaged Lieutenant Colonel George Styles GC, a retired British Army {{officer who was}} {{regarded}} as an expert in explosives and ballistics. Styles believed {{that it would have}} been obvious to the authorities that Savage's car was unlikely to contain a bomb as the weight would have been obvious on the vehicle's springs; he also expressed his opinion that a remote detonator could not have reached the car park from the scenes of the shootings given the number of buildings and other obstacles between the locations. As the government refused to comment on the shootings until the inquest, the documentary concluded by putting its evidence to a leading human rights lawyer, who expressed his belief that a judicial inquiry was necessary to establish the facts surrounding the shootings.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, {{fipronil}} {{was blamed}} for the spread of CCD among bees, {{in a study by}} the Minutes-Association <b>for</b> <b>Technical</b> Coordination Fund in France, which found that even at very low nonlethal doses, this pesticide still impairs the ability to locate the hive, resulting in large numbers of foragers lost with every pollen-finding expedition, though no mention was made regarding any of the other symptoms of CCD; other studies, however, have shown no acute effect of fipronil on honey bees. Fipronil is designed to eliminate insects similar to bees, such as yellowjackets (Vespula germanica) and many other colonial pests by a process of 'toxic baiting', whereby one insect returning to the hive spreads the pesticide among the brood.|$|E
5|$|In December 1966, Rowland became {{commanding}} officer of No.3 Aircraft Depot (No.3 AD) at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, with the acting rank of group captain; his promotion was made substantive in November 1967. After completing his tenure at No.3 AD in January 1969, Rowland was appointed Senior Engineering Staff Officer at Headquarters Operational Command in Glenbrook, New South Wales. In 1971 he was posted to Britain to attend the Royal College of Defence Studies, London. Returning to Australia, he was Director-General of Aircraft Engineering before being promoted to air vice marshal to serve as Air Member <b>for</b> <b>Technical</b> Services (AMTS), the RAAF's senior engineering position, in November 1972. The AMTS occupied {{a seat on the}} Australian Air Board, the service's controlling body that was chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS).|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of the 20th century, {{education}} remained a major political issue in New South Wales. While Selfe would not be drawn again into the centre of the fray, he supported the efforts of his sister Maybanke and her second husband Francis Anderson towards education reform. Following the Knibbs-Turner Royal Commission into New South Wales Education in 1902, and the appointment of Peter Board as Director of Education in 1905, many of Selfe's ideas <b>for</b> <b>technical</b> education were implemented. Ultimately, in 1949, a separate Department of Technical Education was created, and the New South Wales University of Technology (later the University of New South Wales) was established at Kensington.|$|E

5|$|One {{source of}} skilled {{personnel}} was the Army itself, particularly the Army Specialized Training Program.

Another source was the Women's Army Corps (WAC). Initially intended for clerical tasks handling classified material, the WACs were soon tapped <b>for</b> <b>technical</b> and scientific tasks as well. On 1 February 1945, all military personnel assigned to the MED, including all SED detachments, were assigned to the 9812th Technical Service Unit, except at Los Alamos, where military personnel other than SED, including the WACs and Military Police, were assigned to the 4817th Service Command Unit.|$|E
