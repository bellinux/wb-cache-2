40|$|This {{fact sheet}} {{describes}} the purpose, lab specifications, applications scenarios, {{and information on}} how to partner with NREL's Energy Systems High Pressure Test Laboratory at the Energy Systems Integration Facility. The purpose of the Energy Systems High Pressure Test Laboratory at NREL's Energy Systems Integration Facility (ESIF) is to provide space where high pressure <b>hydrogen</b> <b>components</b> can be safely tested. High pressure hydrogen storage {{is an integral part of}} energy storage technology for use in fuel cell and in other distributed energy scenarios designed to effectively utilize the variability inherent with renewable energy sources. The high pressure storage laboratory is co-located with energy storage activities such as ultra-capacitors, super conducting magnetic flywheel and mechanical energy storage systems laboratories for an integrated approach to system development and demonstration. Hazards associated with hydrogen storage at pressures up to 10, 000 psi include oxygen displacement, combustion, explosion, and pressurization of room air due to fast release and physical hazards associated with burst failure modes. A critical understanding of component failure modes is essential in developing reliable, robust designs that will minimize failure risk beyond the end of service life. Development of test protocol for accelerated life testing to accurately scale to real world operating conditions is essential for developing regulations, codes and standards required for safe operation. NREL works closely with industry partners in providing support of advanced hydrogen technologies. Innovative approaches to product design will accelerate commercialization into new markets. NREL works with all phases of the product design life cycle from early prototype development to final certification testing. High pressure tests are performed on <b>hydrogen</b> <b>components,</b> primarily for the validation of developing new codes and standards for high pressure hydrogen applications. The following types of tests can be performed: Performance, Component and system level efficiency, Strength of materials and hydrogen compatibility, Safety demonstration, Model validation, and Life cycle reliability...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{microscope}} {{mechanism of}} hydrogen embrittlement (HE) is overviewed {{from the viewpoint}} of Mechanics-Microstructure-Environment Interactions. The plastic deformation (Mechanics) at crack tip for low strength steel is controlled by hydrogen concentration (Environment) to crack tip, eventually resulting in very strong time dependent phenomenon in static fracture and fatigue crack growth. Various typical phenomena in low strength steels which can be understood {{from the viewpoint of}} Mechanics-Environment Interactions will be presented. Fracture and fatigue of high strength steels (Microstructure) are strongly influenced by hydrogen. Especially, fatigue crack growth is remarkably accelerated by hydrogen-induced deformation twins. The HE phenomemon of the high-strength steels was applied to a newly inclusion rating method. Hydrogen trapped by nonmetalliec inclusions causes the elimination of fatigue limit at very high cycle fatigue. The values of threshold stress intensity factor KTH in hydrogen for small cracks are much smaller than those for long cracks measured by the standard WOL or CT specimens, which are eventually unconservative for the design of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>components.</b> This phenomenon is similar to the small crack problem in fatigue...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In {{this study}} we report the first {{hydrogen}} isotope composition analyses on carbonado diamond along with cathodoluminescence and scanning electron microscopic imaging, electron microprobe analyses, and stable (H and C) and radiogenic (Sr) isotope measurements. The hydrogen of bulk carbonado (consisting diamond and pore-filling minerals) yielded ∼ − 4 ‰, consistent with usual crustal or mantle-derived fluids. The diamond-related <b>hydrogen</b> <b>component</b> is about 70 ± 30 ppm and shows a D-depletion down to − 200 ‰. Determined H isotope values — together with C isotope compositions — overlap the ranges for mantle-derived hydrocarbons. Textural characteristics and Sr isotope ratios of pore-filling florencite indicate that the carbonado was formed in a fluid-rich environment, underwent a significant high-temperature influence and finally suffered thorough alteration. Based on these observations, a terrestrial formation during interaction of mantle rocks/melts or subducted crustal materials and reduced C-H fluids {{seems to be more}} plausible than an extraterrestrial origin...|$|E

An economic model considering the rate of decrease in price and the limit cost of non-mature technologies is developed and metrics about the efficiencies, system reliability, economic, and environmental performance for the system are defined. These are applied to a case study of a remote household application in Victoria, Australia. Considering a reference scenario of using a conventional diesel generator for power supply and LPG for hot water supply, the results of this analysis confirmed the economic feasibility of implementing the SH CHP-ST system for remote household applications along with high reliabilities (100 % for power, and 95 % for thermal) for the case study.

We also undertake an investigation of systematic errors in a system where an existing deuterium measurement has been made. We measure the number of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>components</b> and their velocity distributions in a moderate and high redshift sample of Lyman limit systems in one Angstrom resolution spectra. We present a new measurement of the deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio, D/H, at z= 3. 2560 in a newly-discovered low metallicity absorption system towards the quasar PG 1937 - 1009. We attempt to account for any systematic effects that could influence the D/H measurement. We find a 1 sigma range for D/H* 1 e 5 of 1. 6 (+ 0. 25) (- 0. 30). Using high resolution spectra from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Very Large Telescope, we assess the suitability of five D/H candidate absorption systems. These systems were selected as candidates using lower resolution spectra. We measure the neutral hydrogen column density, identify metal lines and analyse the velocity structure of each system, and show them to be unsuitable for measuring D/H. We also investigate the systematic errors in the absorber at z= 0. 701 towards quasar PG 1718 - 4801 that was initially thought to show a high primordial D/H value. We analyse the dependence of the putative deuterium line's parameters on wavelength calibration errors in the HST spectra and present a revised deuterium measurement. We examine the velocity widths of two samples of one Angstrom resolution quasar spectra showing Lyman limit absorption systems.
