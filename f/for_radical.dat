5|$|Perhaps most important, the Analytical Review {{provided}} a forum <b>for</b> <b>radical</b> {{political and religious}} ideas. Although it aimed at impartiality, its articles were often critical of the British government and supportive of the French revolutionaries. While the journal had low circulation numbers for its day, it still influenced popular opinion and was feared by the conservative government of William Pitt the Younger. In late 1797, the Anti-Jacobin, the self-styled nemesis of the Analytical Review, was founded by supporters {{of the government and}} other reactionary interests; it criticized the radical politics of the Analytical and monitored it for unpatriotic and irreligious sentiments.|$|E
5|$|Henry Hastings, {{the third}} earl, was a zealous {{promoter}} of puritanism and founded Ashby Grammar School to provide education {{in accordance with}} his religious views. Anthony Gilby had lived in exile in Geneva {{during the reign of}} Mary, but was invited to Ashby by the earl and made the town a nationally important centre <b>for</b> <b>radical</b> Protestantism. Attempts by the church authorities to discipline him failed, and he died after 25 years spent preaching and pamphleteering. Hastings' influence meant that between 1562 and 1632 Ashby had a succession of Puritan ministers. The last of these was Arthur Hildersham, another influential figure who sought to internationalise radical Protestantism, but became vulnerable to the strictures of his bishop after Henry Hastings died in 1595. Hildersham was barred from preaching or deprived of his living for 17 of the 38 years of his incumbency, Earl Henry was interred in St Helen's after a lavish funeral befitting his status as Lord President of the Council of the North.|$|E

5|$|Through 1915–16, China and Indonesia {{were the}} major bases for the conspirators, and {{significant}} {{efforts were made}} by the British government to coax China into the war to attempt to control the German and Ghadar intrigues. This would also allow free purchase of arms from China for the Entente powers. However, Yuan's proposals for bringing China into the war were against Japanese interests and gains from the war. This along with Japanese support for Sun Yat Sen and rebels in southern China laid the foundations for deterioration of Anglo-Japanese relations as early as 1916. After the end of the Great War, Japan increasingly became a haven <b>for</b> <b>radical</b> Indian nationalists in exile, who were protected by patriotic Japanese societies. Notable among these were Rash Behari Bose, Tarak Nath Das, and A. M. Sahay. The protections offered to these nationalists, most notably by Toyama Mitsuru's Black Dragon Society, effectively prevented British efforts to repatriate them and became a major policy concern.|$|E
5|$|The {{controversial}} 1905 {{partition of}} Bengal had a widespread political impact. Acting as a stimulus <b>for</b> <b>radical</b> nationalist opinion in India and abroad, {{it became a}} focal issue for Indian revolutionaries. Revolutionary organisations like Jugantar and Anushilan Samiti had emerged in the 20th century. Several significant events took place. These included assassinations and attempted assassinations of civil servants, prominent public figures and Indian informants, including one in 1907 aiming to kill the Bengal Lieutenant-Governor Sir Andrew Fraser. Matters {{came to a head}} when the 1912 Delhi–Lahore Conspiracy, led by erstwhile Jugantar member Rash Behari Bose, attempted to assassinate the then Viceroy of India, Charles Hardinge. In the aftermath of this event, the British Indian police made concentrated police and intelligence efforts to destroy the Bengali and Punjabi revolutionary underground. Though the movement came under intense pressure for some time, Rash Behari successfully evaded capture for nearly three years. By the time World War I had begun in Europe in 1914, the revolutionary movement had revived in Punjab and Bengal. In Bengal the movement, with a safe haven in the French base of Chandernagore, had sufficient strength to all but paralyse the state administration. The earliest mention of a conspiracy for armed revolution in India appears in Nixon's Report on Revolutionary Organisation, which reported that Jatin Mukherjee (Bagha Jatin) and Naren Bhattacharya had met the Crown Prince of Germany during the latter's visit to Calcutta in 1912, and obtained an assurance that they would receive supplies of arms and ammunition. At the same time an increasingly strong pan-Islamic movement started developing, mainly in the north and north-west regions of India. With the onset of the war in 1914, the members of this movement formed {{an important component of the}} conspiracy.|$|E

40|$|Correlations {{of various}} indices of the {{stability}} and reactivity of carbon-centered radicals with ESR hyperfine splitting constants have been examined. For {{a large number of}} mono- and disubstituted radicals there is a moderately good linear correlation of R-proton hyperfine splitting constants (a(HR)) with radical stabilization enthalpies (RSE) and with BDE(C-H), the C-H bond dissociation energies for the corresponding parent compounds determined from thermodynamic and kinetic studies of C-C homolysis reactions. There is a similarly satisfactory linear correlation of a(HR) with BDE-(C-H) determined by Bordwell’s electrochemical and acidity function method. In all cases the correlations fail <b>for</b> nonplanar <b>radicals.</b> As expected, â-proton hyperfine splitting constants (a(HâMe)) <b>for</b> <b>radicals</b> with a freely rotating methyl substituent are less sensitive to deviations from planarity and give better linear correlations with RSE and BDE(C-H). The correlations cover a range of more than 20 kcal/mol and are reliable predictors of RSE and BDE(C-H) for a variety of radicals including captodative species. However, the correlations fail <b>for</b> significantly nonplanar <b>radicals</b> and <b>for</b> <b>radicals</b> with cyclic delocalized systems, e. g., cyclopentadienyl. The ratio a(HâMe) / a(HR) <b>for</b> suitably substituted <b>radicals</b> provides an index of pyramidalization and allows one to decide for which compounds values of RSE and BDE(C-H) can be confidently estimated...|$|R
