40|$|Statutes provide law {{enforcement}} with effective tools {{for dealing with}} criminals in society. There can be, unfortunately, laws that have unclear messages or simply do not make sense. Indiana has such a law. Indiana Criminal Code 9 - 30 - 2 - 2 provides certain mandates that police officers must follow {{in order to make}} a traffic stop to enforce all laws pertaining to the use of motor vehicles on Indiana highways. Indiana requires all officers to either be in a uniform, or in a clearly marked police vehicle in order to arrest or <b>issue</b> <b>a</b> <b>summons</b> <b>to</b> motor vehicle law violators. Even though most motorists are not aware of this law, it has created confusion and uncertainty for officers. Because of this uncertainty, this law’s intent has been questioned and challenged at the trial court level and at different courts of appeals in Indiana. These courts have struggled to define when an arrest occurs and have ruled to allow private citizens to make criminal arrests when police officers were not allowed to make the very same arrests. As a result of several of these court decisions, faults with the law have been recognized by criminal justice professionals. These faults, coupled with better legal examples from other, more progressive states, illustrate the necessity for a change in Indiana Code 9 - 30 - 2 - 2. This research will provide the reader with legal briefs that are applied to various officers’ enforcement of motor vehicle law and some sample statutes from other states. Also included are opinions from local officers, officers from other states, as well as local prosecutors and judges.

50|$|By the mid-1640s, the privateering {{community}} of Irish, Flemish and French based in Wexford had {{a fleet of}} 200 cargo ships and 21 frigates whose purpose was to attack English ships between Biscay and the Baltic.

An army of 7,000 foot soldiers and 2,000 cavalry camped north {{of the town and}} sent a detachment to capture Rosslare fort {{at the mouth of the}} harbour.

5000|$|In February 2014 {{the court}} made {{international}} headlines when {{a former member}} of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) launched a rare private prosecution bid with the court, which <b>issued</b> <b>a</b> <b>summons</b> <b>to</b> Thomas S. Monson (the current leader of the LDS Church) to answer claims under the 2006 Fraud Act. A church spokesperson characterised the allegations as bizarre, later stating that Monson has no intention of appearing in person at the 14 March hearing. Experts consulted by the press found it highly unlikely that Monson would be extradited from the United States. A former crown prosecutor stated: [...] "I think the British courts will recoil in horror. This is just using the law to make a show, an anti-Mormon point. And I'm frankly shocked that <b>a</b> magistrate has <b>issued</b> it." [...] The person lodging the complaint is the managing editor of [...] "a website highly critical of the church." [...] John Dehlin stated he believed publicity to be the plaintiff's goal, and that it worked, based on the 800,000 page views to the plaintiff's website on 4 February, a record for that site. Monson did not appear at the 14 March hearing, but instead was represented by legal counsel, who contested the summons. On 20 March, Judge Howard Riddle, chief magistrate in Westminster Magistrates' Court, ruled that the case was [...] "an abuse of the process of the court" [...] and that [...] "the court is being manipulated to provide a high-profile forum to attack the religious beliefs of others".|$|R
