5|$|Sony {{announced}} on April 2, 2012 {{that the three}} films would be re-released on June 12, 2012. The DVDs {{of the first two}} films reinstated a selection of the bonus features missing from the earlier Blu-ray releases, although the Spider-Man 3 reissue <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>the</b> bonus disc of additional special features that appeared on earlier Blu-ray releases.|$|E
5|$|The Committee's mandate <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>the</b> {{use of the}} bomb—its use upon {{completion}} was presumed. Following a protest by scientists involved in the project, {{in the form of}} the Franck Report, the Committee re-examined the use of the bomb. In a June 21 meeting, it reaffirmed that there was no alternative.|$|E
5|$|The interdiction campaigns {{were also}} expensive. Igloo White cost around one billion dollars {{per year to}} operate. The cost of the bombing {{operations}} that the sensors supported amounted to approximately 18.2million dollars per week. Those costs <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>the</b> hundreds of aircraft lost during the interdiction campaigns or the priceless crews that manned them.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, the Egyptian Air Force {{placed an}} order for 36 AH-64A helicopters. These Apaches were {{delivered}} {{with most of the}} advanced avionics used on the U.S. fleet at that time, with the exception of localized radio equipment. In 2000, Boeing announced an order to remanufacture Egypt's existing Apache fleet to the AH-64D configuration. Notably, the AH-64D upgrade <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>the</b> procurement of the Longbow radar, the supply of which had been refused by the U.S. government. Egypt requested a further 12 AH-64D Block II Apaches through a Foreign Military Sale in 2009.|$|E
5|$|In March 1971, the NTSB {{released}} a report summarizing {{the findings of a}} study of midair collisions. The report indicated that 204 of 396 fatalities in U.S. jetliner crashes since 1967 had occurred in mid-air collisions. Additionally, near-miss situations involving jetliners occurred on average at least once per day, with the Los Angeles and New York areas noted as being especially high-risk. Finally, the report noted that the current trend in air casualties indicated that a further 528 people would die in mid-air collisions during the following ten years. These figures <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>the</b> casualties from Flight 706.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell and Galle were {{terminated}} from WCMH in June 2009. A {{few days}} later, both nurses were arrested. They {{were charged with}} misuse of official information, a felony that carries the possibility of ten years imprisonment and fines up to $5,000. Roberts said that the nurses filed the complaint as a personal vendetta {{rather than as a}} good faith reporting of facts. He also noted that Mitchell and Galle sent the medical records of ten patients to the TMB without their consent; however, the reports <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>the</b> names of patients and federal law exempts medical board reports from patient privacy laws.|$|E

5|$|On January 29, 1971, the Mint {{announced}} the {{prices for the}} 40% silver pieces which would be struck at San Francisco: $3 for uncirculated specimens and $10 for mirror-surfaced proof pieces, with orders to be taken by mail beginning on July 1, with a limit of five of each per customer. Order forms for the public were shipped to 44,000 post offices and 33,000 banks, with instructions not to hand them out until June 18. The Mint returned some orders for being sent in too early. Mint sets of the circulating coinage for 1971 <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>the</b> Eisenhower dollar.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{insisted that}} its {{purchase}} also included most of West Florida {{and all of}} Texas. Thomas Jefferson claimed that Louisiana stretched west to the Rocky Mountains and included the entire watershed of the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers and their tributaries, and that the southern border was the Rio Grande. Spain maintained that Louisiana extended {{only as far as}} Natchitoches, and that it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>the</b> Illinois Territory.|$|E
5|$|The {{estimated}} construction cost <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>the</b> R$38.1million {{required for}} adding temporary bleachers, which were removed after the World Cup was over. They were set {{on one of}} the sides and on the north and south ends. The addition of the bleachers would raise the stadium's capacity up to 72,000 seats, but would necessitate the relocation of VIP areas and television equipment reducing capacity. Corinthians paid for additional temporary infrastructure required exclusively for the World Cup, which was estimated to cost between R$60million and 100million.|$|E

5|$|The new {{keyboard}} <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>the</b> BASIC keyword markings {{that were}} found on earlier Spectrums, except for the keywords LOAD, CODE and RUN which were useful for loading software. This was not a major issue, as the +2 boasted a menu system, almost identical to the ZX Spectrum 128, where one could switch between 48K BASIC programming with the keywords, and 128K BASIC programming in which all words (keywords and otherwise) must be typed out in full (although the keywords are still stored internally as one character each). Despite these changes, the layout remained identical {{to that of the}} 128.|$|E
5|$|The {{starting}} peloton <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>the</b> 1985 winner, Bernard Hinault. An El Mundo Deportivo writer believed LeMond, Moser, and Saronni to be {{the favorites}} to win the overall crown. In addition, the writer felt that Pedro Muñoz had the best chances to win the race, {{out of all the}} Spanish riders entering the event. Atala-Ofmega sports director Franco Criblori believed that Saronni's results would depend on what form he could maintain in the mountains. In addition, Criblori thought Dutchman Johan van der Velde and Swiss rider Niki Rüttimann were two foreigners to consider for a high place in the general classification.|$|E
5|$|A revised design {{turned the}} {{mezzanine}} floor {{into an area}} {{that could be used}} as an arts venue, cinema, music auditorium or conference room for 120 to 150people. New plans cost £60,000. However this new design was deemed to be unworkable. A second design consisted of another six-storey building with a large ground-floor shop, a first-storey car park, and four floors of flats. This would have been half a metre less in height than the previous design, and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>the</b> tower. The plan was initially rejected by the council, but was subsequently approved in April 2008, before being rejected by the Planning Inspectorate. Several later applications for the site were also rejected, particularly due to concerns over parking, and the site was vacant as of June 2015.|$|E
