5|$|Taking part in {{the third}} series of the BBC family-history {{documentary}} series, Who <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Think</b> <b>You</b> <b>Are?,</b> Lawson sought to uncover some of her family's ancestry. She traced her ancestors to Ashkenazi Jews who originate from eastern Europe and Germany, leaving Lawson surprised not to have Sephardi ancestry, as she had believed. She also uncovered that her maternal great-great-great grandfather, Coenraad Sammes (later Coleman Joseph), had fled to England from Amsterdam in 1830 to escape a prison sentence following a conviction for theft. His daughter Hannah married Samuel Gluckstein (1821-1873), who was in business with Barnett Salmon of Salmon & Gluckstein. They had several children, including Isidore and Montague Gluckstein, who together with Salmon founded J. Lyons and Co. in 1887, and Helena, who married him. One {{of the children of}} Helena and Barnett Salmon was Alfred Salmon (1868-1928), the great-grandfather of Nigella Lawson.|$|E
