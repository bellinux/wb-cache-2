5|$|Western Swing, {{a musical}} genre with roots in country music, was made popular at Tulsa's Cain's Ballroom. The Tulsa Sound, a {{variation}} of rockabilly, blues, and rock 'n' roll, was started and largely developed by local musicians J. J. Cale and Leon Russell in the 1960s and 1970s. The Tulsa Sound heavily influenced musicians Eric Clapton and Jimmy Markham. Musicians from Tulsa or who started their musical careers in Tulsa include Garth Brooks, The <b>Gap</b> <b>Band,</b> Hanson, Caroline's Spine, Ronnie Dunn, Gene Autry, David Gates, Jamie Oldaker, Jim Keltner, Bob Wills, David Cook, Broncho, Tyson Meade, John Moreland, The Damn Quails, LANY, and JD McPherson. In 2012, Tulsa was ranked as {{having one of the}} best music scenes outside of New York, Los Angeles and Nashville.|$|E
25|$|Similar to Prince, other bands {{emerged during}} the P-Funk era and began to {{incorporate}} uninhibited sexuality, dance-oriented themes, synthesizers and other electronic technologies to continue to craft funk hits. These included Cameo, Zapp, the <b>Gap</b> <b>Band,</b> the Bar-Kays, and the Dazz Band all found their biggest hits in the early 1980s. By {{the latter half of}} the 80s, pure funk had lost its commercial impact; however, pop artists from Michael Jackson to Duran Duran often used funk beats.|$|E

The claim on behalf of The <b>Gap</b> <b>Band</b> and Lonnie Simmons was entered into YouTube’s content management system preventing payments to the publisher.

The track features mainly electric guitar and bass, along with string arrangements and 1970s synthesizers reminiscent of Zapp and The <b>Gap</b> <b>Band.</b> Its lyrics refer to a make-believe situation in which Spears describes an encounter with a man at a party.

2500|$|The {{beginnings}} of hip-hop in the Philippines {{can be attributed}} to several main factors; the innate of them being the heavy influx of American musical styles in that country as reflected in the widespread popularity during the 1960s of Motown artists The Temptations, The Supremes and The Jackson Five and later in the 1970s of funk, soul and disco music. Bands such as The Commodores, The <b>Gap</b> <b>Band,</b> James Brown, Con Funk Shun, The Bar-Kays and Earth, Wind and Fire among many others received heavy rotation on Manila airwaves. The future importation of hip hop culture and music, similar to the previous genres mentioned can be credited to the direct contact Filipinos received with both Americans and Filipino Americans, or as they are commonly called [...] "balikbayans", stemming from the root words [...] "balik" [...] meaning to come back and [...] "bayan" [...] loosely translating into hometown or homeland.|$|E

Mechanisms of formation and properties of these <b>band</b> <b>gaps</b> are analyzed. Peculiarities of spectra of photonic crystals that arise due to the linkage between <b>band</b> <b>gaps</b> are discussed.

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Over {{the last few}} years, {{there has been a}} great deal of {{research}} interest in developing organic conjugated polymers with narrow energy <b>band</b> <b>gaps.</b> Narrow <b>band</b> <b>gap</b> polymers would be intrinsically conducting, and thus eliminating the need for doping. There are several approaches for the construction of low <b>band</b> <b>gap</b> systems. Copolymerization of aromatic and o-quinoid heterocycles, minimization of bond length alternation, copolymerisation of donor and acceptor moieties might be most important factors for the lowering the <b>band</b> <b>gap.</b> The main aim of this work is to determine the reasons for low <b>band</b> <b>gaps</b> and to analyse the major effects, separately. Recently a number of low <b>band</b> <b>gap</b> systems were synthesized. These systems consist of aromatic donors and quinoid acceptors. To analyse the behaviour of donor/acceptor systems, we performed theoretical studies for these systems. We chose thieno [3, 4 -b] pyrazine (ThP), F-substituted thieno [3, 4 -b] pyrazine (F-ThP) and quinoxaline (Qx) as an acceptor and thiophene (Th) and pyrrole (Py) as donor units. Monomer through octamer of ThP, monomer through tetramer of F-ThP and Qx, were optimised by using density functional theory (DFT). All calculations were performed with the Gaussian 98 program. For ThP-Th and ThP-Py co-oligomers, energy levels were calculated for monomer through tetramer and, for F-ThP-Py, monomer through trimer data were used. Ionization Potentials (IPs), electron affinities (EAs), <b>band</b> <b>gaps,</b> and <b>band</b> widths of polymers were obtained by extrapolation. IPs and EAs are taken as negative HOMO and LUMO energies. The order of the <b>band</b> <b>gaps</b> of the homo-polymers is found: F-PThP (1. 1 eV) < PThP(1. 4 eV) < PQx. (2. 4 eV). <b>Band</b> <b>gaps</b> of the systems are found to agree well with the experimental results. We increased the acceptor strength of PThP by adding fluorine units. The <b>band</b> <b>gap</b> is decreased by adding fluorine, however, the valence band width decreased, too. According to the donor-acceptor concept, we predict narrow <b>band</b> <b>gaps</b> and wider <b>band</b> widths for donor-acceptor co-polymers. However, for ThP-Th and ThP-Py copolymers, the <b>band</b> <b>gaps</b> are smaller than those of the homo polymers, but there is no increase on conduction band width. ThP-Th and ThP-Py have the same <b>band</b> <b>gap</b> (1. 2 eV). The stronger donor pyrrole does not lead to a smaller <b>band</b> <b>gap</b> and wider <b>band</b> widths than the weaker donor thiophene. Thus, there is a contradiction with donor-acceptor concept qualitatively, and also quantitatively. The results show that, there is no certain correlation between <b>band</b> <b>gaps</b> and inner bond lengths. The bond length alternation (BLA) data are not consistent with the <b>band</b> <b>gap</b> results. Due to our results, the geometrical mismatch between aromatic and quinoid repeat units forces geometry distortions that impose smaller <b>band</b> <b>gaps.</b> Overall, we concluded that the situation is more complicated than simple concepts imply and further studies are required before a final conclusion can be reached.
