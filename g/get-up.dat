5|$|The {{video of}} the song {{features}} {{the majority of the}} film's cast at a celebration event where this song is performed. To entertain the attendees that have arrived at Pooja's (Renuka Shahane) baby shower, her sister Nisha (Madhuri Dixit) and her husband's cousin Rita (Sahila Chadha) arrange a comic skit. While Nisha is presented as a pregnant lady with a pillow stuffed belly, Rita is seen in a young man's <b>get-up</b> which resembles to that of Prem (Salman Khan) who is Pooja's devar (younger brother-in-law). Throughout the song's lyrics, Nisha tells everyone of how Prem is deewana (crazy) and always tries to woo girls. The fake Prem, i.e. Rita, always tries to flirt and tease all the ladies, especially Nisha. He also hits Nisha's bum with a marigold flower, using a slingshot. Afterwards, the fake Prem is shown being beaten by all the present ladies. Then, the real Prem, who was secretly watching the comic skit, comes in and hits Nisha's bum again with a marigold flower. Following this, Prem jumps off the balcony and hangs onto the chandelier. Afraid of being caught red handed in imitating him, Nisha and Rita try to run away. Surprisingly, Prem begs pardon for his behaviour towards Nisha. The video ends with Prem faking a pregnant lady in lingerie. The clip has a large group of female dancers dancing in-sync in the background. Amongst the prominent star cast of the film, Bindu, Himani Shivpuri, Priya Arun, Laxmikant Berde, are also seen throughout the video.|$|E
500|$|One of Brooks's most {{analyzed}} paintings, a 1924 {{portrait of}} Una, Lady Troubridge, {{has been seen}} as everything from an image of female self-empowerment to a caricature. [...] Art critic Michael Duncan sees the painting as making fun of Troubridge's [...] "dandified appearance", while for Meryle Secrest it is [...] "a tour de force of ironic commentary". Laura Doan, pointing out newspaper and magazine articles from 1924 in which high collars, tailored satin jackets, and watch fobs are described as the latest in women's wear, describes Troubridge as having a [...] "keen fashion sense and an eye for sartorial detail". [...] But, these British fashions may not have been favored in Paris; Natalie Barney and others in her circle considered Troubridge's outfits ridiculous. [...] Brooks expressed her own view in a letter to Barney: [...] "Una is funny to paint. Her <b>get-up</b> is remarkable. She will live perhaps and cause future generations to smile." ...|$|E

Brittany Spanos of Rolling Stone called [...] "Black Widow" [...] a [...] "great song" [...] and praised its [...] "hypnotic chorus." [...] Rory Cashin of Entertainment.ie felt the track had [...] "future hit written all over it", and lauded Ora's [...] "sing-along chorus", Stargate's [...] "fantastic" [...] production, and considered the song to be a [...] "darker alternative" [...] to [...] "Dark Horse". A writer for MuchMusic felt [...] "Black Widow" [...] was [...] "a killer collaboration", {{in the same vein}} as Azalea's fourth single [...] "Fancy" [...] which featured Charli XCX. MTV Buzzworthy's Nedeska Alexis placed the song in her list of the 4 Songs You Have To Hear from the album, and said Perry [...] "worked her magic on the track." [...] Lucy O'Brien of The Quietus called the track a [...] "call-and-response anthem." [...] Marie Claire journalist Lauren Valenti deemed the song [...] "deliciously wicked" [...] and [...] "nothing short of brilliant", and commended Ora's vocal delivery on the track's hook. A writer for Rap-Up called Azalea and Ora [...] "a deadly duo" [...] on the song. Saeed Saeed of The National highlighted [...] "Black Widow" [...] as a stand out track on The New Classic and praised its [...] "strong chorus and slithering beats." [...] Saeed's view was echoed by John Wiley of The Heights who listed the song as one of two highlights on the record. Writing for The Sydney Morning Herald, Craig Mathieson stated, [...] "while her verses don't have the sustained length of her previous underground releases, Azalea skillfully upsets convention." [...] Kyle Moody of the Marquette Wire preferred Azalea's sound [...] "Black Widow" [...] to the more rap-orientated songs on The New Classic. Laetitia Wong Wai Yi of Today felt the track attained well-deserved hype and commended it for [...] "perfectly" [...] combining Azalea's vocal fluidity with its minimalistic dance breakdown. Glamour journalist Megan Angelo positively reviewed the song, writing, [...] "'Black Widow' isn't just an excellent <b>get-up,</b> get-ready, get-moving song for Friday night—it also happens to be a Women Killing Music summit {{in the form of a}} neat little track." ...|$|E

500|$|Beyoncé's {{mother and}} {{designer}} Tina Knowles, House of Deréon, Giorgio Armani, Versace, Elie Saab and Herve Leger {{served as the}} designers for the outfits of the tour. Jon Pareles of The New York Times described the clothes as mainly silvery, ranging from miniskirts to formal dresses, flesh-toned bodysuit to bikini to negligee. Pareles further noted that [...] "The wardrobe entices men, but it's also a means of self-assertion". J. Freedom du Lac of The Washington Post described the costumes during the show as [...] "spangly". Lee Hildebrand of the San Francisco Chronicle praised the costumes saying that [...] "every one [...] fabulously glamorous, most of them tailored to highlight the singer's ample cleavage {{and a pair of}} legs to rival Tina Turner's. At one point, when the legs were concealed by a long scarlet gown, wind blew from underneath to expose them." [...] Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe praised the floor-length gown but disliked the tinfoil mini worn by Knowles. Lisnaree Vichitsorasatra of The Nation praised Knowles' look, saying that she was like a [...] "glittering goddess in a revealing outfit". Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter also echoed her statements, [...] "to say that Beyonce looks terrific is probably redundant. Her fashion parade of form-fitting, eye-catching costumes -- most notably a belly dancer's <b>get-up</b> in which she demonstrated some hip-shaking moves that indicated Shakira better watch her back -- provided ample opportunities for shameless leering." [...] John Aizlewood of the Daily Mail described the fashion as [...] "majestic". Gordon Smart from the newspaper The Sun praised the [...] "sexy costumes" [...] like the silvery dresses worn by Knowles and added that [...] "her audiences certainly haven't had a bum deal". Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times commented that [...] "the camouflage outfits her male dancers sometimes wore... felt right for a show that sometimes seemed like a military operation, expertly executed." [...] Irish Independents Eamon Sweeney noted that Knowles looked [...] "absolutely stunning" [...] and added, [...] "I have to confess that the sight of Beyoncé ripping off a short cocktail dress to reveal a barely there bodysuit will linger in my memory for years to come." [...] A writer of The StarPhoenix wrote that Knowles looked like a [...] "silver-clad siren rose" [...] further saying that [...] "it was almost surreal to see the woman who frequents the covers of fashion magazines in the same room". Tonya Turner from The Courier-Mail praised Knowles for looking [...] "every bit the dream girl in a sparkling silver floorlength gown".|$|E

2500|$|Our {{mechanic}} {{and general}} runner was David Nice, an Englishman from Colchester, {{who was not}} unlike me in a way, for his nose appeared to be, profile view anyway, very similar to mine (poor lad!) and I hit on the splendid idea of putting him out on the track in my place during the neutralised period. Tracksuited, a scarf over {{the lower part of}} his face and a Russian hat that I had bought completed the disguise. He was me to anyone giving a cursory glance at the figures plodding round the track. The <b>get-up</b> was quite in order for it became very cold there at night as they used to turn off all the heating. Everything went well for the first night of the wheeze and I congratulated myself on the plan. It could not go on [...] for ever, though, worse luck, for on the very next night the game was up. Dave was trundling round wrapped up to the eyebrows as before when, horrors upon horrors, the track manager, who often rode a bike round himself during the quiet time, started to talk to him.|$|E
2500|$|The five knights {{gather in}} Camelot, a {{deliberately}} anachronistic place resembling Las Vegas's Camelot-inspired Excalibur resort, complete with showgirls, oversized dice and the Lady of the Lake headlining the Castle in full Cher <b>get-up</b> ("Knights Of The Round Table"/"The Song That Goes Like This (Reprise)"). In {{the midst of}} their revelry, they are contacted by God (a recording voiced by John Cleese of the original Monty Python troupe and Eric Idle in the version currently touring the UK) who tells them to locate the Holy Grail. Urged on by the Lady Of The Lake ("Find Your Grail"), the Knights set off. They travel throughout the land until they reach a castle, only to be viciously taunted by lewd French soldiers. They attempt to retaliate by sending them a large wooden rabbit {{in the style of}} the Trojan Horse; however, they realise after the fact that it was not as simple as leaving the rabbit and walking away – they should have hidden inside it. [...] Defeated, they leave in a hurry when the French begin taunting them again, sending cancan dancers after them and throwing barnyard animals including cows at them ("Run Away!"). Arthur and his followers manage to run into the safety of the wings before the French catapult the Trojan Rabbit at them.|$|E
2500|$|Filming {{began on}} February 26, 2007 in Romania. [...] The film was shot on several soundstages at MediaPro Studios in Buftea, Romania. [...] Several sets {{built at the}} soundstages {{included}} an English village, the Stanton family's country home, a medieval church, and a mysterious ruin known as the Great Hall. [...] Cinematographer Joel Ransom chose to have such sets, including {{the reconstruction of the}} 13th century chapel that took four months to construct, built to surround the actors so he could use 360-degree camera sweeps in the locations to represent time travel sequences. Director David Cunningham chose to minimize the use of visual effects in The Seeker, only creating around 200 visual effects for the film. [...] Instead, the director pursued practical means to carry out the effects of the film's scenes. [...] A thousand snakes were shipped in from the Czech Republic to be dumped on the actors, real water was used to wipe out a mansion in the film, and real birds were trained to fly at the actors. Cunningham also hired Viking reenactors to assist with the Viking element in the film. The crow-like birds are consistent with the book's signature harbingers of the Dark: the rooks. One visitor to the set said that the rooks were represented by [...] "a half-dozen trained ravens." [...] Costume designer Vin Burnham designed a riding cloak for The Rider (Christopher Eccleston), a black <b>get-up</b> lined with real fur and feathers for an animalistic appearance. [...] Burnham provided eccentric 1960s outfits for the character Miss Greythorne (Frances Conroy), with Celtic symbols incorporated into the outfits. [...] The costume designer also wove small crystals into the outfits worn by Conroy and Ian McShane so that the outfits glisten on camera.|$|E
