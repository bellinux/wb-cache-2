In his rookie season, Allen played in all 16 regular season games for the Dolphins, where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> primarily as a cornerback. He remained on the team through the off-season but was waived in mid-August.|$|E
5|$|Cooksey was {{a utility}} player, {{due to his}} {{versatility}} on the left-flank and in the centre of midfield as a box-to-box midfielder.

During his spell with Grays Athletic, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> as a defender, playing as a left full-back.|$|E

Hester {{appeared}} in 12 games for the Ravens, where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> exclusively on special teams.

5|$|Adamle {{was again}} {{one of eight}} Browns chosen for the Pro Bowl after Cleveland's 1951 season, when the team reached the {{championship}} game but lost to the Los Angeles Rams. He was named a first-team All-Pro by United Press International and the New York Daily News after the season, when he had one interception and one fumble recovery. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> mainly as an outside linebacker in Cleveland's 5-3 defense later in his career, only attempting three rushes in the 1950s. Adamle finished college at Kent State University in 1950, earning a bachelor's degree, and received a master's degree in education from Western Reserve University in Cleveland in 1951.|$|E
5|$|Allemang {{was signed}} by the Hamilton Tiger-Cats before the 1977 season, {{and he went on}} to play in 31 games for the Tiger-Cats through 1978. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> in a variety of roles. While Al Romano was injured in 1978, Allemang {{featured}} as a starting defensive lineman. He later replaced the injured Bruce Holland as a defensive tackle. Outside of these brief stints as a starter, Allemang served as a back-up for both the offensive and defensive lines.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin {{founded a}} new {{production}} company, Attica, and used Shepperton Studios for the shooting. Filming in England proved a difficult experience, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> {{to his own}} Hollywood studio and familiar crew, and no longer had limitless production time. According to Robinson, this {{had an effect on}} the quality of the film. A King in New York was released in September 1957, and received mixed reviews. Chaplin banned American journalists from its Paris première and decided not to release the film in the United States. This severely limited its revenue, although it achieved moderate commercial success in Europe. A King in New York was not shown in America until 1973.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his second}} major junior season, Jovanovski signed a four-year, $5.7 million {{contract}} with the Panthers in June 1995. Playing with the club during the subsequent pre-season, he broke his right hand during a fight with Hartford Whalers forward Brendan Shanahan. The injury caused him to miss the first 11 games of the season. After recovering, he scored his first career NHL goal against the Whalers on December 2, 1995, a game-winner in a 5–3 victory. He finished his rookie season with 10 goals and 21 points over 70 games. During the regular season, he was encouraged by Panthers management to play more conservatively than <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> to in the OHL, focusing on defensive positioning.|$|E
5|$|He was {{generally}} more highly regarded for his batting than his wicket-keeping, often drawing criticism {{for the quality}} of his glovework. Despite this, he was at times considered to be a better wicket-keeper than two of his rivals for England; Bairstow and Buttler. Nonetheless, playing in an era when international teams did not play specialist wicket-keepers, Kieswetter's selection was based primarily upon his batting ability, rather than his keeping ability. For a couple of matches during 2012, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> as an off spin bowler by Somerset, collecting three wickets.|$|E
5|$|Henderson {{established}} himself as a full-time NHL player in 1964–65, though with limited ice time. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> primarily in a defensive role and to kill penalties, scoring 8 goals and 21 points, while appearing in 70 games. Switching to the left wing in 1965–66, Henderson played a more offensive role and scored 22 goals. He added three more in 12 playoff games as the Red Wings reached the 1966 Stanley Cup Final versus the Montreal Canadiens. Henderson scored the game-winning goal in {{the first game of the}} finals. After winning the first two games in Montreal, Detroit lost four straight and the series.|$|E

5|$|In the {{remainder}} of the season, Crawford scored 232 against Somerset, his highest first-class score, as well as centuries against Derbyshire and Hampshire. The increased strength and variety of Surrey's bowling attack restricted his opportunities; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> less as a strike bowler and bowled fewer overs than in the previous season. Contemporary reports suggested that his performances tailed off as the season progressed, possibly through tiredness from having played too much cricket, and that he became a less accurate bowler through trying too hard to spin the ball. The Surrey captaincy remained unsettled; Crawford led the team on several occasions, including Surrey's final game of the season, when his brother Vivian captained Leicestershire, their opponents.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Warelwast's {{background}} or family before 1087. Later in life {{he was involved in}} founding Augustinian houses of canons, which– according to historian – implies that he was an Augustinian canon or spent some of his early years in a house of such canons. Several medieval chroniclers hostile to Warelwast, including Eadmer, claim that he was illiterate, but his career suggests otherwise, as it involved the extensive use of written documents. He must also have been an accomplished speaker, given the number of times <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> as a diplomat. He was possibly educated at Laon, where later in life he sent his nephew, Robert Warelwast, to school. Another nephew, William, became the bishop's steward.|$|E
5|$|McCarty {{made the}} active roster and played in all 18 regular season games his rookie season. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> {{in the passing}} game and on the special teams, {{finishing}} with seven receptions for 99 {{yards and a touchdown}} as well as five special-teams tackles. McCarty made his CFL debut on June 28 in the season opener against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. He received his first carry and reception in a Week 10 game against the Calgary Stampeders, where he was given two carries for one yard and caught one reception for 10 yards.|$|E
