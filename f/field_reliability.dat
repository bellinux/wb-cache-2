40|$|Traditionally <b>field</b> <b>reliability</b> {{has been}} {{measured}} and {{predicted by the}} use of manufacturing data. One of the great challenges that manufacturers of electronic products face is trying to measure accurately how a product is performing in the field. Based on a literature review as well as discussions with an electronics company, it was determined that it was necessary to base <b>field</b> <b>reliability</b> monitoring on field data. The company had a previous reliability issue where a product was performing poorly in the field but by time it was identified and corrective action was taken, it had cost the company millions of dollars. For this company it was important to determine if a product’s reliability in the field was performing well or deteriorating. The relevant literature research was divided into three main fields: Introduction to reliability, field databases in use in industry and finally measuring field data. The field study focused on two products for Company X. The main tools used to measure and model the data were, Rate of occurrence of failures (ROCOF), replacement rate by month trending, replacement index (RI) modelling and control charts. Future prediction was facilitated {{by the use of}} the lognormal distribution plot. Product A had a latent defect that only exhibited in the field and wasn’t identified until nineteen months after it started shipping from manufacturing site. Product B was a very similar product to Product A however performed very well in the field. The results showed clearly the Product A did not perform as well as product B. The RI model indicated at a very early stage that there was evidence of wear-out for Product A. The p control chart would have indicated six months before the actual investigation happened that there was a problem with this product. The lognormal distribution plot was very accurate in predicting the future reliability of the product. The results show that these techniques can provide a company with a clear indication of <b>field</b> <b>reliability</b> and highlight areas of concern...|$|E

"Under incentivized contractual mechanisms such as availability-based contracts, the support service provider and its customer must share a common understanding of equipment reliability baselines. Emphasis is typically placed on the information technology-related solutions for capturing, processing and sharing vast amounts of data. In the case of repairable fielded items, scant attention is paid to the pitfalls within the modelling assumptions that are often endorsed uncritically and seldom made explicit during <b>field</b> <b>reliability</b> data analysis. This paper presents a case study in which good practices in reliability data analysis are identified and applied to real-world data with the aim of supporting the effective execution of a defence avionics availability-based contract.

40|$|An {{important}} step for {{active noise control}} (ANC) systems to be practical is to develop model independent ANC (MIANC) systems that tolerate parameter variations in sound <b>fields.</b> <b>Reliabilities</b> and stabilities of many MIANC systems depend on results of online system identifications. Parameter errors due to system identifications may threaten closed-loop stabilities of MIANC systems. A self-learning active noise control (SLANC) system is proposed in this study to stabilize and optimize an ANCsystem in case identified parameters are unreliable. The proposed system uses an objective function to check closed-loop stability. If partial or full value of the objective function exceeds a conservatively preset threshold, a stability threat is detected and the SLANC system will stabilize and optimize the controller without using parameters of sound fields. If the reference signal is available, the SLANC system can be combined with a feedforward controller to generate both destructive interference and active damping in sound fields. The self-learning method is simple and stable for many feedback ANCsystems {{to deal with a}} worst case discussed in this study.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} automated perimetry of elderly subjects naïve to AP after listening to a Mozart sonata. INTRODUCTION: Automated perimetry (AP) is a psychophysical test used to assess visual fields in patients with neurological disorders and glaucoma. In a previous study, Fiorelli et al. showed that young subjects who listened to a Mozart sonata prior to undergoing AP performed better in terms of reliability {{than those who did}} not listen to the sonata. METHODS: Fifty-two AP-naïve, normal subjects underwent Automated perimetry (SITA 24 - 2). The study group (25 subjects) underwent AP after listening to Mozart's Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major, and the control group (27 subjects) underwent Automated perimetry without prior exposure to the music. RESULTS: The study group had significantly lower false negative rates and a lower visual <b>field</b> <b>reliability</b> score than the controls (P= 0. 04 and P= 0. 04, respectively). The test time was shorter for the study group (P= 0. 03). DISCUSSION: This study shows that elderly subjects, when exposed to the Mozart sonata immediately before AP testing, have lower false negative rates and lower visual <b>field</b> <b>reliability</b> scores when compared with an age- and gender-matched control group. Our results differ from those of Fiorelli et al. who found lower false positive rates and less fixation loss in addition to lower false negative rates. CONCLUSION: Listening to a Mozart sonata seems to improve automated perimetry reliability in elderly subjects...|$|E
