25|$|Speaking {{before the}} opening of the Ordinary Synod of Bishops on the Family in October 2015, McAleese {{ridiculed}} the concept of 300 elderly celibates coming together to discuss family questions. Addressing a meeting of the Global Network of Rainbow (LGBT) Catholics {{on the eve of the}} Vatican’s Synod on the Family, former president McAleese said: “In the days when I was president, we had workshops on various issues and if <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at an issue, I would consult the experts... But look at the Synod, I have to ask the question: If I wanted expertise on the family, I honestly cannot say that the first thing that would come into my mind would be to call together 300 celibate males who, as far we know, have never raised a child...“Let me repeat a question I asked last year when I saw the Vatican’s lengthy pre-Synod questionnaire, namely how many of these men have ever changed a child’s nappy? For me that is a very important question because it is one thing to say that we all grew up in families, we had mothers, we had fathers but it is a very different thing to raise a gay child, a very different thing to live daily in a relationship and to police the relationships between children and the world.” Acknowledging that the Synod will doubtless be considering the Catholic Church's pastoral approach to homosexuals, McAleese described herself as “cynical” about the outcome of the forthcoming three week consultation.|$|E

His concept was to show how a murder [...] "makes victims of the whole {{community}} {{in all sorts of}} different ways. Some of them are able to deal with that and recover from that and build something from it; for some people it means they're destroyed by that so <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> basically at a whole set of characters affected by this one devastating event and the different effects it had on people, so it really made sense of that and played straight into that central idea." [...] His scripts then focused on {{what it would be like}} for each character to live through an actual murder investigation and its aftermath. This required removing as much police procedure from the scripts as possible, and focusing on character development.|$|E

It features video clips of skateboarders, cartoons and shots from old movies, {{as well as}} paparazzi footage of Paz de la Huerta falling down while intoxicated. These are interspersed with shots of Del Rey singing, which she filmed herself using a webcam. When asked if she would change anything about the video's production, Del Rey stated, [...] "Had I known {{so many people were}} going to watch the video, I'd have put some more effort into it. I would have got my hair and make-up done and tried not to be so pouty, seeing as everyone talks about my face all the time. And I'd have put more of a storyline into it." [...] The singer also revealed that she was [...] "trying to look smart and well turned-out, rather than 'sexy' [...] Of course <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> good, but 'smart' was the primary focus." ...|$|E

6000|$|It was in {{the moment}} of turning away that I somehow learned, without looking, that Mrs. Brissenden had also {{immediately}} moved. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> and yet had my reasons for not appearing to do it too quickly; in spite of which I found my friends, even after an interval, still distinguishable as separating for the avoidance of comment. Gilbert Long, rising directly after his associate, had already walked away, but this associate, lingering where she stood and meeting me with it, availed herself of the occasion to show that she wished to speak to me. Such was the idea she threw out on my forthwith going to her. [...] "For a few minutes--presently." ...|$|E

"You talk as if {{you were}} a tailor," [...] said Miss Bordereau whimsically; and then she added quickly, in a {{different}} manner, [...] "This house is very fine; the proportions are magnificent.

When your man came, just now, to learn if I would see you, I was on the point of sending for you, to ask if you didn't mean to go on. I wanted to judge what I'm letting you have.

6000|$|Meantime Babie {{had been}} out with her two little cousins, and came home immensely {{impressed}} with the Belforest gardens. The house was shut up, but the gardens were really kept up to perfection, and the little one could not declare her full delight in the wonderful blaze she had seen of banks of red, and flame coloured, and white, flowering trees. [...] "They said they would show me the Americans," [...] she said. [...] "Why was it, mother? I thought Americans were like the gentleman who dined with you one day, and {{told me about the}} snow birds. But there were only these flower-trees, and a pond, and statues standing round it, and I don't think they were Americans, for I know one was Diana, because she had a bow and quiver. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the rest, but Miss James said they were horrid heathen gods, not fit for little girls to look at; and, mother, Ellie is so silly, she thought the people at Belforest worshipped them.

60|$|Another of the {{milestones}} on my road to manhood was {{my first}} employment of the town barber. Up to this time my hair had been trimmed by mother or mangled {{by one of the}} hired men,--whereas both John and Burton enjoyed regular hair-cuts and came to Sunday school with the backs of their necks neatly shaved. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like that, and so at last, shortly after my victory concerning the hat, I plucked up courage to ask my father for a quarter and got it! With my money tightly clutched in my hand I timidly entered the Tonsorial Parlor of Ed Mills and took my seat in his marvellous chair--thus touching another high point on the road to self-respecting manhood. My pleasure, however, was mixed with ignoble childish terror, for not only did the barber seem determined to force upon me a shampoo (which was ten cents extra), but I was in unremitting fear lest I should lose my quarter, the only one I possessed, and find myself accused as a swindler.|$|E
6000|$|After a few minutes, {{during which}} no one spoke, the three sisters turned away, and re-entered the church. Helen and Dora had reached the north door, and were leaving the church, when they missed Elizabeth, and looking round, saw her sitting {{in one of the}} low pews, in the centre aisle, her face raised towards the {{flamboyant}} tracery of the east window. Dora, who seemed to have a sort of perception that her presence was a restraint upon her sisters, whispered, 'I am going to feed the doves,' and hastened across the quadrangle, while Helen came back to Elizabeth's side. Her sister rose, and with her own bright smile, said, 'Helen, I could not help coming here, it was where I sat at the day of the funeral, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at that flame-shaped thing {{in the top of the}} window, as I did all through the reading of the Lesson. Do you see? What strange thoughts were in my head, as I sat looking at that deep blue glass, with its shape like an angel's head and meeting wings, and heard of glories celestial! I never hear those words without seeing that form.' ...|$|E
60|$|It was useless, at present, to {{ask myself}} such {{questions}} as these. I was too much agitated to think collectedly on the most trifling subjects. I was even too restless to stay in my own room. My son's letter had given me so fresh an interest in Jessie that I was now as impatient to see her {{as if we were}} about to meet for the first time. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at her with my new eyes, to listen to her with my new ears, to study her secretly with my new purposes, and my new hopes and fears. To my dismay (for I wanted the very weather itself to favor George's interests), it was raining heavily that morning. I knew, therefore, that I should probably find her in her own sitting-room. When I knocked at her door, with George's letter crumpled up in my hand, with George's hopes in full possession of my heart, it is no exaggeration to say that my nerves were almost as much fluttered, and my ideas almost as much confused, as they were on a certain memorable day in the far past, when I rose, in brand-new wig and gown, to set my future prospects at the bar on the hazard of my first speech.|$|E
