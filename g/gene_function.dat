5|$|McClintock {{was widely}} {{credited}} with discovering transposition after other researchers finally discovered {{the process in}} bacteria, yeast, and bacteriophages in the late 1960s and early 1970s. During this period, molecular biology had developed significant new technology, and scientists were able to show the molecular basis for transposition. In the 1970s, Ac and Ds were cloned by other scientists and were shown to be Class II transposons. Ac is a complete transposon that can produce a functional transposase, which {{is required for the}} element to move within the genome. Ds has a mutation in its transposase gene, which means that it cannot move without another source of transposase. Thus, as McClintock observed, Ds cannot move in the absence of Ac. Spm has also been characterized as a transposon. Subsequent research has shown that transposons typically do not move unless the cell is placed under stress, such as by irradiation or the breakage-fusion-bridge cycle, and thus their activation during stress can serve as a source of genetic variation for evolution. McClintock understood the role of transposons in evolution and genome change well before other researchers grasped the concept. Nowadays, Ac/Ds is used as a tool in plant biology to generate mutant plants used for the characterization of <b>gene</b> <b>function.</b>|$|E

500|$|Early {{embryonal}} lethality, {{also known}} as early embryonic death or a non-viable embryo, may occur when the embryo possesses two dominant white alleles, or have the homozygous genotype.

[...] However, it is possible that homozygous embryos from alleles of missense and splice site mutations might be viable because they have less effect on <b>gene</b> <b>function.</b> A 2013 study also unearthed horses that were compound W5/W20 heterozygotes, almost completely white, essentially with greater depigmentation than could be accounted for by either allele alone.|$|E

Outside of pigmentation, piebaldism is an otherwise benign condition. In pigs, the [...] "patch," [...] "belted," [...] and commercial [...] "white" [...] colors are caused by mutations on the KIT gene.

To date, no such pleiotropic effects have been described in horses with KIT mutations.|$|E
500|$|Epigenetics is {{the study}} of {{heritable}} changes in <b>gene</b> <b>function</b> that cannot be explained by changes in the underlying DNA sequence but cause the organism's genes to behave (or [...] "express themselves") differently. One example of epigenetic change is the marking of the genes by DNA methylation which determines whether they will be expressed or not. Gene expression can also be controlled by repressor proteins that attach to silencer regions of the DNA and prevent that region of the DNA code from being expressed. Epigenetic marks may be added or removed from the DNA during programmed stages of development of the plant, and are responsible, for example, for the differences between anthers, petals and normal leaves, {{despite the fact that they}} all have the same underlying genetic code. Epigenetic changes may be temporary or may remain through successive cell divisions for the remainder of the cell's life. Some epigenetic changes have been shown to be heritable, while others are reset in the germ cells.|$|E

2500|$|Unbound AR {{is mainly}} {{located in the}} cytoplasm, like a typical steroid receptor, and is {{associated}} with a complex of heat shock proteins (HSP) through interactions with LBD. Androgens, either agonists or antagonists, position themselves in the ligand-binding pocket (LBP) of the cytosolic AR and bind to the LBD, see figure 2. The AR goes through a series of conformational changes and HSP dissociate from AR. The transformed AR undergoes dimerisation, phosphorylation and translocates to the nucleus. The translocated receptor then binds to the androgen-response elements (ARE) on the promoter of the androgen responsive gene, a consensus sequence located either upstream or downstream of the transcription start site (TSS) of AR target genes. [...] Recruitment of other transcription co-factors (including co-activators and co-repressors) and general transcriptional machinery further ensures the transactivation of AR-regulated gene expression. All these complicated processes are initiated by the ligand-induced conformational changes in the LBD. Ligand specific recruitment of coregulators might be crucial for the agonist or antagonist activity of AR ligands. Binding of DNA is also required for AR-regulated gene expression, also known as classic genomic <b>gene</b> <b>function</b> of AR.|$|E

[...] Several caspases, in addition to APAF-1 and FADD, have been mutated to determine the new phenotype. [...] In order to create a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) knockout, an exon containing the nucleotides 3704â€“5364 was removed from the gene. [...] This exon encodes a portion of the mature TNF domain, as well as the leader sequence, which is a highly conserved region necessary for proper intracellular processing. [...] TNF-/- mice develop normally and have no gross structural or morphological abnormalities. [...] However, upon immunization with SRBC (sheep red blood cells), these mice demonstrated a deficiency in the maturation of an antibody response; they were able to generate normal levels of IgM, but could not develop specific IgG levels. [...] Apaf-1 is the protein that turns on caspase 9 by cleavage to begin the caspase cascade that leads to apoptosis. [...] Since a -/- mutation in the APAF-1 gene is embryonic lethal, a gene trap strategy was used in order to generate an APAF-1 -/- mouse. [...] This assay is used to disrupt <b>gene</b> <b>function</b> by creating an intragenic gene fusion. [...] When an APAF-1 gene trap is introduced into cells, many morphological changes occur, such as spina bifida, the persistence of interdigital webs, and open brain. [...] In addition, after embryonic day 12.5, the brain of the embryos showed several structural changes. [...] APAF-1 cells are protected from apoptosis stimuli such as irradiation.
