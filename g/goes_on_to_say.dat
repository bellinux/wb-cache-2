5|$|In June 2015, Pakistani {{media reports}} {{suggested}} that export orders {{have also been}} confirmed and signed with the Sri Lanka Air Force, according to Pakistan-based 92 News while some other sources claim that Myanmar is the first buyer of Pakistani JF-17 Thunder jets. The article <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that deliveries are likely to begin in 2017. According to the report, the order will be for around 18–24 aircraft, potentially confirming claims made at the 51st Paris Air Show that the first contract {{for the sale of}} the JF-17 had been signed with the Sri Lanka Air Force.|$|E
5|$|The book {{begins by}} looking at religion, {{specifically}} God as non-being and as being, put by Stace as the negative and positive divine. Stace then defines two orders of being - time and eternity, which he says intersect {{in the moment of}} mystic illumination. He <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the nature of God or eternity is such that all religious language is symbolic and that it is necessarily subject to contradictions.|$|E
5|$|The {{opposition}} to the ritual is not explicit in the oldest Upanishads. On occasions, the Upanishads extend {{the task of the}} Aranyakas by making the ritual allegorical and giving it a philosophical meaning. For example, the Brihadaranyaka interprets the practice of horse-sacrifice or ashvamedha allegorically. It states that the over-lordship of the earth may be acquired by sacrificing a horse. It then <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that spiritual autonomy can only be achieved by renouncing the universe which is conceived in the image of a horse.|$|E

5|$|Isabeau was {{dismissed}} by historians as a wanton, weak and indecisive leader. Modern historians now {{see her as}} taking an unusually active leadership role for a queen of her period, forced to take responsibility {{as a direct result}} of Charles' illness. Her critics accepted skewed interpretations of her role in the negotiations with England, resulting in the Treaty of Troyes, and in the rumors of her marital infidelity with Orléans. Gibbons writes that a queen's duty was to secure the succession to the crown and look after her husband; historians described Isabeau as having failed in both respects, and she came to be seen as one of the great villains of history. Gibbons <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that even her physical appearance is uncertain; depictions of her vary depending on whether she was to be portrayed as good or evil.|$|E

25|$|Explaining how sacraments are means or instruments, not ends in themselves, Francis says: He <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{that true}} disciples {{encounter}} the Lord in the sacraments and receive {{the power to}} follow Jesus' teaching.

25|$|Lucio Russo {{has said}} that Plutarch, in his work On the Face in the Moon, was {{reporting}} some physical theories that we consider to be Newtonian and that these may have come originally from Hipparchus; he <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Newton may {{have been influenced by}} them.

25|$|Maimonides, one of Judaism's most {{important}} theologians and legal experts, explained in detail why Jesus {{was wrong to}} create Christianity and why Muhammad was wrong to create Islam; he laments the pains Jews have suffered in persecution from followers of these new faiths as they attempted to supplant Judaism (in the case of Christianity, called Supersessionism). However, Maimonides then <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that both faiths {{can be considered a}} positive part of God's plan to redeem the world.|$|E
25|$|During {{a workout}} with Barry Bonds in 2001, a cream {{was applied to}} Sheffield's knee by a trainer to help heal ripped {{stitches}} from a knee surgery.

He <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in his book that the cream did nothing to strengthen his knee, and also states that a look at his numbers shows no improvement after the incident.|$|E
25|$|Jordanes {{admits that}} he did not then have direct access to Cassiodorus's book, and could not {{remember}} the exact words, but that he felt confident that he had retained the substance in its entirety.

25|$|Dawkins {{interviews}} Haggard {{and begins}} by likening the worship experience to a Nuremberg Rally of which Goebbels {{might have been}} proud. Haggard says he knows nothing of the Nuremberg Rallies and <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that some evangelicals think of his services as something akin to rock concerts. Haggard said the Bible is true and doesn't contradict itself as science does. Dawkins contends that the advantage of science is that new evidence changes ideas, allowing the advancement of human knowledge, something religion does not allow. Steadily the exchanges become increasingly fractious.|$|E
25|$|In {{a review}} by Gadget lab, {{disputes}} that the contrast was higher and actually {{states that the}} font appears to be fuzzier {{than that of the}} first generation Kindle. The review <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that changes to the Kindle 2 have made it tougher to read the smaller font sizes that most books use. Some writers discuss how the font size is at times worse than that of the first generation Kindle. It appears that whether the Kindle 2 is clearer or fuzzier than the prior model depends on the font size.|$|E
25|$|The {{remaining}} {{evidence for}} Thucydides's life comes from rather less reliable later ancient sources. According to Pausanias, someone named Oenobius {{was able to}} get a law passed allowing Thucydides to return to Athens, presumably sometime shortly after the city's surrender {{and the end of the}} war in 404 BC. Pausanias <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Thucydides was murdered on his way back to Athens. Many doubt this account, seeing evidence to suggest he lived as late as 397 BC. Plutarch claims that his remains were returned to Athens and placed in Cimon's family vault.|$|E
