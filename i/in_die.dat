5|$|In 2014 {{the novel}} was adapted for BBC Radio 4's Saturday Drama strand. Toby Stephens, who played Gustav Graves <b>in</b> <b>Die</b> Another Day, portrayed Bond. Joanna Lumley {{appeared}} {{in both the}} film and radio adaptations of the novel.|$|E
5|$|A running joke {{throughout}} the film series is Moneypenny's unrequited love for Bond and his playful flirting with her. She flirts back, jokes and sometimes pouts, hoping to wrangle a proposal and {{a wedding ring}} out of him. A fantasy sequence <b>in</b> <b>Die</b> Another Day marks the only occasion in the Eon film series in which Moneypenny was actually shown in a romantic embrace with Bond, although this is only in Q-branch's virtual reality machine.|$|E

40|$|While once widely {{rejected}} {{as a health}} care option, physician aid <b>in</b> <b>dying</b> is receiving increased recognition {{as a response to}} the suffering of patients at the end of life. With aid <b>in</b> <b>dying,</b> a physician writes a prescription for a life-ending medication for an eligible patient. Following the recommendation of the American Public Health Association, the term aid <b>in</b> <b>dying</b> rather than "assisted suicide" is used to describe the practice. In this Viewpoint, the authors describe the changing legal climate for physician aid <b>in</b> <b>dying</b> occurring <b>in</b> several states...|$|R

These first three installments in the Die Hard series grossed over US$700 million internationally and propelled Willis to the first rank of Hollywood action stars.|$|E
5|$|Mühe {{was already}} seriously ill at the prize-giving {{ceremony}} in Los Angeles in February 2007 when Das Leben der Anderen was awarded its Oscar, and {{flew back to}} Germany hours later for an urgent stomach operation. In an article <b>in</b> <b>Die</b> Welt dated 21 July 2007, Mühe discussed his diagnosis of stomach cancer which had put his acting career on hold; he died the following day. On 25 July 2007 he was buried in his mother's village of Walbeck in the Landkreis (rural district) of Börde, Saxony-Anhalt.|$|E
5|$|On 3 September 1942 Marseille claimed six {{victories}} (nos. 127–132) but {{was hit by}} {{fire from}} the British-Canadian ace James Francis Edwards. Der Adler, a biweekly Nazi propaganda magazine published by the Luftwaffe, also reported his actions in volume 14 of 1942. Marseille was made famous through propaganda that treated fighter pilots as superstars. He regularly signed postcards with his image. Aside from Der Alder, his exploits were published <b>in</b> <b>Die</b> Berliner, Illustrierte, Zeitung and Die Wehrmacht.|$|E

5|$|The {{position}} that the general strike could be used, but {{only as a last}} resort, became dominant in the party during the mass strike debate. This caused much concern among the conservatives in the party, especially among many trade unionists. At a meeting in February 1906, the trade unionists were placated by party leaders, who said they would attempt to prevent a general strike at all costs. The FVdG reacted by publishing the secret protocols from the meeting <b>in</b> <b>Die</b> Einigkeit, greatly angering the party leadership.|$|E
5|$|The precise {{size of the}} {{heterogeneous}} group {{gathered by}} Alboin is impossible to know, and many different estimates have been made. Neil Christie considers 150,000–500,000 to be a realistic size, a number which would make the Lombards a more numerous force than the Ostrogoths {{on the eve of}} their invasion of Italy. Jörg Jarnut proposes 100,000–150,000 as an approximation; Wilfried Menghen <b>in</b> <b>Die</b> Langobarden estimates 150,000 to 200,000; while Stefano Gasparri cautiously judges the peoples united by Alboin to be somewhere between 100,000 and 300,000.|$|E
5|$|A {{widely used}} alloy which {{contains}} zinc is brass, in which copper is alloyed with anywhere from 3% to 45% zinc, {{depending upon the}} type of brass. Brass is generally more ductile and stronger than copper and has superior corrosion resistance. These properties make it useful in communication equipment, hardware, musical instruments, and water valves. Other widely used alloys that contain zinc include nickel silver, typewriter metal, soft and aluminium solder, and commercial bronze. Alloys of primarily zinc with small amounts of copper, aluminium, and magnesium are useful <b>in</b> <b>die</b> casting as well as spin casting, especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries. These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak. Roughly one quarter of all zinc output, in the United States (2009), is consumed {{in the form of}} zinc compounds, a variety of which are used industrially.|$|E

5|$|Alloys of zinc {{with small}} amounts of copper, aluminium, and {{magnesium}} are useful <b>in</b> <b>die</b> casting as well as spin casting, especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries. These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak. An {{example of this is}} zinc aluminium. The low melting point together with the low viscosity of the alloy makes possible the production of small and intricate shapes. The low working temperature leads to rapid cooling of the cast products and fast production for assembly. Another alloy, marketed under the brand name Prestal, contains 78% zinc and 22% aluminium, and is reported to be nearly as strong as steel but as malleable as plastic. This superplasticity of the alloy allows it to be molded using die casts made of ceramics and cement.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{successful}} {{version of}} Dr. No, produced in 2008 {{as a special}} one-off to mark the centenary of Ian Fleming's birth, Eon Productions allowed a second Bond story to be adapted. On 3 April 2010, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a radio adaptation of Goldfinger with Toby Stephens (who played villain Gustav Graves <b>in</b> <b>Die</b> Another Day) as Bond, Ian McKellen as Goldfinger and Stephens' Die Another Day co-star Rosamund Pike as Pussy Galore. The play was adapted from Fleming's novel by Archie Scottney and was directed by Martin Jarvis.|$|E
5|$|In January 2012 Radner {{made her}} debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City in Götterdämmerung. The {{production}} was {{documented in the}} film Wagner's Dream by Robert Lepage and the 11 February 2012 performance was recorded and broadcast by radio. In March 2012, she participated <b>in</b> <b>Die</b> Frau ohne Schatten at La Scala under Marc Albrecht. In the fall of 2012, {{she was at the}} Royal Opera House in London performing in three Wagner operas conducted by Pappano: the Erda in Siegfried and Rheingold during September and October, and the first norn in Götterdämmerung during October and November 2012. She sang in Dvorak's Requiem under Tomas Netopil in Lyon, and in Mahler's Symphony No.3 under Sebastian Weigle in Frankfurt am Main.|$|E

5|$|In early 1942, Rudel {{got married}} while home on leave. Later in the year, he {{took part in}} the Battle of Stalingrad. In February 1943, Rudel flew his 1,000th combat mission. He then participated in the {{experiments}} with using the Ju87G in the anti-tank role. The anti-tank unit took part in operations against the Soviet Kerch–Eltigen Operation. The footage from an onboard gun camera was used <b>in</b> <b>Die</b> Deutsche Wochenschau, a Reich Ministry of Propaganda newsreel. In April 1943, Rudel was awarded the Oak Leaves to the Knight's Cross, receiving them from Hitler personally in Berlin. Rudel participated in the Battle of Kursk with the same unit. In October 1943, Rudel was credited with the destruction of his 100th tank and was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords on 25 November.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, Delius began a {{fruitful}} association with German supporters of his music, the conductors Hans Haym, Fritz Cassirer and Alfred Hertz at Elberfeld, and Julius Buths at Düsseldorf. Haym conducted Over the Hills and Far Away, which he gave under its German title Über die Berge <b>in</b> <b>die</b> Ferne on 13 November 1897, {{believed to be}} the first time Delius's music was heard in Germany. In 1899 Hertz gave a Delius concert in St. James's Hall in London, which included Over the Hills and Far Away, a choral piece, Mitternachtslied, and excerpts from the opera Koanga. This occasion was an unusual opportunity for an unknown composer at a time when any sort of orchestral concert was a rare event in London. In spite of encouraging reviews, Delius's orchestral music was not heard again in an English concert hall until 1907.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius vietus {{was first}} {{described}} by Elias Magnus Fries in 1821 as Agaricus vietus in his Systema Mycologicum. In his 1838 work Epicrisis systematis mycologici, Fries reclassified the species as a Lactarius, giving it its current name. |publisher=CAB International |work=Index Fungorum |accessdate=27 December 2010}} Subsequent attempts to reclassify the {{species have been}} unsuccessful. In his 1871 work Der Führer <b>in</b> <b>die</b> Pilzkunde, Paul Kummer reclassified the species {{as a member of}} Galorrheus, and in Otto Kuntze's 1891 Revisio generum plantarum, the species was placed in the genus Lactifluus. Both Galorrheus vietus and Lactifluus vietus are now considered obligate synonyms (different names for the same species based on one type) of Lactarius vietus. The specific epithet is from the Latin , meaning shrunken. It is commonly known as the grey milkcap.|$|E

5|$|Madame Schmidt did {{not talk}} about the matter even after the war. She died in 1954 at the age of 71 without {{revealing}} the identity of any of her former employees. Total number of Gestapo recordings from the brothel was estimated by the Stasi (East German Security Service) to be about 25,000. Virtually all of the recordings have since been lost or destroyed due to their post-war unimportance. According to a 2005 article <b>in</b> <b>Die</b> Tageszeitung, the brothel continued to exist after World War II under the management of Schmidt's son and daughter. In the 1990s, it was turned into a home for asylum-seekers, which was closed soon after because of local protest against the residents.|$|E
5|$|Oils {{that are}} used include heavy {{residual}} oil (HRO), animal fats, vegetable fats, and synthetic fats. HROs are gelatinous at room temperature, but at the high temperatures found <b>in</b> <b>die</b> casting, they form a thin film. Other substances are added to control the emulsions viscosity and thermal properties; these include graphite, aluminium, and mica. Other chemical additives are used to inhibit rusting and oxidation. Emulsifiers are added to water-based lubricants, so that oil based additives can be mixed into the water; these include soap, alcohol esters, and ethylene oxides.|$|E
5|$|Paul Kummer raised many of Fries' tribi (subgenera) to genus rank in his 1871 work Der Führer <b>in</b> <b>die</b> Pilzkunde, {{classifying}} the violet chanterelle in {{the genus}} Thelephora. Jacques Emile Doassans and Narcisse Théophile Patouillard {{placed it in}} the genus Neurophyllum (also spelt Nevrophyllum) in 1886, removing it from Cantharellus on account of its orange spores. Charles Horton Peck discarded the name in 1887 and returned G.clavatus to Cantharellus. In 1891, German botanist Otto Kuntze published Revisio generum plantarum, his response to what he perceived as poor method in existing nomenclatural practice. He coined the genus Trombetta to incorporate the violet chanterelle, hence giving it the name Trombetta clavata. However, Kuntze's revisionary program was not accepted {{by the majority of}} botanists.|$|E
