5|$|Southern Rhodesia was {{regarded}} as an ideal location for air training {{for a number of}} reasons. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> the hostilities, firmly pro-British and had excellent weather throughout the year. The British Air Ministry resolved to outsource training to the colony amid some urgency in late 1939 after EATS {{took a long time to}} get going in Canada. The RATG was the last EATS group to be formed, but the first to start training airmen; it also turned out fully qualified pilots before any of the others, doing so for the first time in November 1940.|$|E
5|$|The battle had firmly {{turned in}} France's favour, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> over. Napoleon ordered Bernadotte's I Corps to support Vandamme's left and moved his own command center from Žuráň Hill to St. Anthony's Chapel on the Pratzen Heights. The {{difficult}} {{position of the}} Allies was confirmed by the decision to send in the Russian Imperial Guard; Grand Duke Constantine, Tsar Alexander's brother, commanded the Guard and counterattacked in Vandamme's section of the field, forcing a bloody effort and the only loss of a French standard in the battle (a battalion of the 4th Line Regiment was defeated). Sensing trouble, Napoleon ordered his own heavy Guard cavalry forward. These men pulverized their Russian counterparts, but with both sides pouring in large masses of cavalry, no victory was clear.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem with}} {{enforcing}} a close blockade with ships was that warships loitering {{off the coast}} of Japan would be vulnerable to attack by aircraft and submarines. Blockading Japanese ports with small ships was a possibility, but this would first require the destruction or neutralisation of the Japanese fleet, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> certain that the Japanese fleet would place itself in a position where it could be destroyed. A plan was adopted for a more distant blockade, whereby ships bound for Japan would be intercepted as they passed through the East Indies or the Panama Canal. This would not cut off Japan's trade with China or Korea, and probably not with the United States either. The effectiveness of such a blockade was therefore questionable.|$|E

5|$|Playford {{became a}} wartime Premier in 1939 when Australia, {{as part of}} the British Empire, entered World War II. Later in the war, cut off from {{traditional}} suppliers of manufactures, the country was forced to create its own. Armaments and munitions factories needed to be created to supply the war effort, and Playford was vociferous in advocating South Australia as the perfect location for these. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> the battlegrounds and had the most efficient labour force in the nation. British Tube Mills opened a mill in the inner-northern suburbs. Ammunition factories were built in the northern and western suburbs of Adelaide, as well as in some smaller installations in regional centres, and construction on a shipyard began in Whyalla. Having strenuously opposed a construction of a pipeline to pump water from Morgan in the River Murray to Whyalla for the steelworks and blast furnace there before his ascension to the premiership, Playford oversaw approval of the Morgan-Whyalla pipeline in 1940 and its completion in 1944. He also reversed his previous opposition to Butler's pine plantation and sawmill program, authorising an expansion of the program in the state's southeast.|$|E

25|$|Chile {{was never}} an {{attractive}} place for European migrants in the 19th and 20th century simply because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> Europe and difficult to reach.

In 1791, the French physician Nicolas Leblanc developed {{a method to}} manufacture soda ash using salt, limestone, sulphuric acid, and coal. Although the Leblanc process came to dominate alkali production in the early 19th century, the expense of its inputs and its polluting byproducts (including hydrogen chloride gas) made it apparent that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> an ideal solution.|$|E

As <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> the Mongolian heartland, members of the Ögedeid and Chagataid families refused to attend.

25|$|VOC {{headquarters}} {{were located}} in Ambon during the tenures {{of the first three}} Governors General (1610–1619), {{but it was not a}} satisfactory location.

As the renovation of the ancient Panathenaic stadium was not yet complete, the contests were held in Loudovikou square in Athens (modern Koumoundourou square). Although they could be termed as the first Olympic Games of the present tradition, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> being an international festival. They had a distinctly national character, since the participants were exclusively of Greek ethnicity, coming both from inside the independent Greek state and the Greek diaspora of the Ottoman Empire.

25|$|The {{division}} of the MAUD Committee at Birmingham was led by Peierls. He was assisted by Haworth, Johnson and, from 28 May 1941, Klaus Fuchs. Haworth led the chemists in studying the properties of uranium hexafluoride. One thing in its favour was that fluorine has only one isotope, so any difference in weight between two molecules is solely due to the different isotope of uranium. Otherwise, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> ideal. It solidified at , was corrosive, and reacted with many substances, including water. It was therefore difficult and dangerous to handle. However, a search by the chemists at Birmingham failed to uncover another gaseous compound of uranium. Lindemann used his influence with Lord Melchett to get ICI to produce uranium hexafluoride on an industrial scale. It also explored methods of producing pure uranium metal.|$|E
