5|$|Electron {{holography}} is an {{imaging technique}} that photographically records the electron interference pattern of an object, {{which is then}} reconstructed to yield a greatly magnified image of the original object. This technique was developed to enable greater resolution in <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy</b> than is possible using conventional imaging techniques. The resolution of conventional <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy</b> is not limited by electron wavelength, but by the large aberrations of electron lenses.|$|E
5|$|<b>Electron</b> <b>microscopy</b> {{offers a}} higher {{resolution}} image. In an electron microscope, {{a beam of}} focused electrons interacts with the sample rather than {{a beam of light}} as in traditional microscopy. In conjunction with rapid freezing techniques, <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy</b> has also been used to study the mechanisms of inter- and intracellular transport, for instance in demonstrating that exocytotic vesicles are the means of chemical release at synapses.|$|E

Although he did not publish the first <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy</b> study of lipid bilayers J. David Robertson was the first to assert that the two dark electron-dense bands were the headgroups and associated proteins of two apposed lipid monolayers. In this body of work, Robertson put forward the concept of the “unit membrane.” This {{was the first time the}} bilayer structure had been universally assigned to all cell membranes as well as organelle membranes.|$|E

5|$|Examination of fruiting bodies using {{scanning}} <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy</b> {{and transmission}} <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy</b> has revealed details about their ultrastructure—their microscopic architecture and arrangement. For example, the hyphae of the hapteron form a dense tangled network, while the hyphae of the funicular cord {{are arranged in}} a twisted form like a rope. Further, the funicular cord, known to be highly elastic and with a high tensile strength, is made of thicker hyphae {{than the rest of}} the funiculus. Also, the ecto- and endoperidium are made of thick-walled, unbranched hyphae, known as skeletal hyphae. It has been proposed that these skeletal hyphae form a structural network that helps the fruiting body maintain the elasticity vital for proper functioning of the spore dispersal mechanism.|$|E
5|$|Niche uses {{of heavy}} metals with high atomic numbers occur in {{diagnostic}} imaging, <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy,</b> and nuclear science. In diagnostic imaging, heavy metals such as cobalt or tungsten {{make up the}} anode materials found in x-ray tubes. In <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy,</b> heavy metals such as lead, gold, palladium, platinum, or uranium are used to make conductive coatings and to introduce electron density into biological specimens by staining, negative staining, or vacuum deposition. In nuclear science, nuclei of heavy metals such as chromium, iron, or zinc are sometimes fired at other heavy metal targets to produce superheavy elements; heavy metals are also employed as spallation targets {{for the production of}} neutrons or radioisotopes such as astatine (using lead, bismuth, thorium, or uranium in the latter case).|$|E

5|$|Only two osmium {{compounds}} {{have major}} applications: osmium tetroxide for staining tissue in <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy</b> {{and for the}} oxidation of alkenes in organic synthesis, and the non-volatile osmates for organic oxidation reactions.|$|E
5|$|Osmium tetroxide {{has been}} used in {{fingerprint}} detection and in staining fatty tissue for optical and <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy.</b> As a strong oxidant, it cross-links lipids mainly by reacting with unsaturated carbon–carbon bonds and thereby both fixes biological membranes in place in tissue samples and simultaneously stains them. Because osmium atoms are extremely electron-dense, osmium staining greatly enhances image contrast in transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy</b> (TEM) studies of biological materials. Those carbon materials have otherwise very weak TEM contrast (see image). Another osmium compound, osmium ferricyanide (OsFeCN), exhibits similar fixing and staining action.|$|E

40|$|There is {{a growing}} need for biolabels {{that can be used}} in both optical and <b>electron</b> <b>microscopies,</b> are non-cytotoxic, and do not photobleach. Such biolabels could enable {{targeted}} nanoscale imaging of sub-cellular structures, and help to establish correlations between conjugation-delivered biomolecules and function. Here we demonstrate a subcellular multi-modal imaging methodology that enables localization of inert particulate probes, consisting of nanodiamonds having fluorescent nitrogen-vacancy centers. These are functionalized to target specific structures, and are observable by both optical and <b>electron</b> <b>microscopies.</b> Nanodiamonds targeted to the nuclear pore complex are rapidly localized in electron-microscopy diffraction mode to enable "zooming-in" to regions of interest for detailed structural investigations. Optical microscopies reveal nanodiamonds for in-vitro tracking or uptake-confirmation. The approach is general, works down to the single nanodiamond level, and can leverage the unique capabilities of nanodiamonds, such as biocompatibility, sensitive magnetometry, and gene and drug delivery.

40|$|Nanoparticles have {{attracted}} considerable recent research interest {{for a variety}} of applications and can be used to visualize and characterise biological processes at the molecular and cellular level. They can be exploited as contrast agents for imaging and functionalised to incorporate luminescent moieties to a provide multi-modal imaging capability. This thesis presents a detailed series of studies on a luminescently labelled gold and silica nanoparticles, with the use of optical and <b>electron</b> <b>microscopies</b> to examine their applications. Using surfactant and peptide pre-coatings gold nanoparticles were coated with an organic dye developed bind to the nanoparticle surface. The imaging potential of these novel nanoprobes is explored by examining uptake in vitro in cancer cells. Confocal laser scanning and transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscopies</b> indicate significant cellular uptake. Nuclear uptake is also observed and possible methods of translocation to the nucleus are discussed. Cell cycle dysregulation is also assessed with no statistically significant perturbations observed. The cellular uptake of 13 nm and 100 nm gold nanoparticles coated with a luminescent ruthenium polypyridyl complex was also investigated. Microscopy studies demonstrated the imaging potential of luminescent nanoprobes upon cellular uptake which was not accompanied significant cytotoxicity. Finally an investigation in to the interaction of luminescent silica particles with dentine is presented. Confocal and scanning <b>electron</b> <b>microscopies</b> enable qualitative comparisons of the dentinal tubule occluding ability of particles coated with surfactants. The data indicate surfactant hydrophobicity is important factor in governing interactions with the dentine and illustrate the potential of luminescence imaging in dentistry...|$|R

The average lattice parameter of the γ‴ cubic cell is 0. 455 nm. Microstructure studies by <b>electron</b> <b>microscopies</b> revealed nanostructured columnar films with no preferential orientation. Diffraction peak intensities (X-ray and electron diffraction) {{are close to the}} theoretical values for a ZnS-type structure while profile analysis of the X-ray diffraction pattern using Rietveld refinement method demonstrated that the γ‴-phase is of ZnS-type. The energy-loss near-edge structures of N K-edge of the γ‴-phase is {{similar to those of the}} ZnS-type γ″-phase suggesting an identical local atomic environment for N atoms. On the contrary, Mössbauer spectra of both structures are different, which is understood as a consequence of numerous vacancies in the γ‴ structure. Investigations of magnetic properties showed that the γ‴-FeN compound is paramagnetic from room temperature to 2 K. The main conclusion of this work is that the γ‴-FeN phase is of ZnS-type, and not of NaCl-type as it is usually reported...|$|R
5|$|In {{contrast}} to plants and animals, the early fossil {{record of the}} fungi is meager. Factors that likely contribute to the under-representation of fungal species among fossils include the nature of fungal fruiting bodies, which are soft, fleshy, and easily degradable tissues and the microscopic dimensions of most fungal structures, which therefore are not readily evident. Fungal fossils are difficult to distinguish from those of other microbes, and are most easily identified when they resemble extant fungi. Often recovered from a permineralized plant or animal host, these samples are typically studied by making thin-section preparations that can be examined with light microscopy or transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy.</b> Researchers study compression fossils by dissolving the surrounding matrix with acid and then using light or scanning <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy</b> to examine surface details.|$|E
