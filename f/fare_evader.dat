5000|$|On December 1, 2008, {{bus driver}} Edwin Thomas, who was {{operating}} a B46 Limited bus that day, was fatally stabbed by a passenger {{who did not}} pay his fare and, as a result, was refused a transfer. It {{was the first time}} a New York City bus operator had been killed on the job since an incident on the [...] in 1981, where another bus driver was fatally shot, also because the driver had refused to give the passenger a transfer. The incident led to the strict enforcement of the MTA policy not to confront fare evaders, and installation of Plexiglas partitions on many city buses to protect bus operators; previously drivers were only protected by a single metal bar. The pilot program for the bus partitions began at the Flatbush Depot, where the B46 is dispatched from, in 2009. The same year as Thomas's stabbing, the MTA and New York City Police Department (NYPD) began deploying teams of police officers as well as squads of uniformed and plainclothes transit security officials (called EAGLE teams) on the B46 and other target routes to crack down on fare evaders, {{in the spirit of the}} broken windows theory. On February 26, 2014, an NYPD officer was shot in the legs by a <b>fare</b> <b>evader</b> after pulling him off a B46 bus.|$|E
50|$|The pilot {{installation}} of the system at the Bankhead station created controversy when it was discovered the fare gates ended 15 in from the ground, allowing <b>fare</b> <b>evaders</b> to crawl underneath the gates. The issue was since corrected with the attachment of plastic bars {{to the bottom of}} the gates, reducing the gap to 6 in and virtually eliminating the possibility of <b>fare</b> <b>evaders</b> crawling through it. Incidents have also been noted in which people trick the sensors to believe that a person is exiting a station while actually entering, but has been alleviated by requiring the use of a card to exit stations.|$|R
5000|$|Since 2015, Iarnród Éireann has {{conducted}} an extensive crackdown on <b>fare</b> <b>evaders</b> by increasing ticket checks on all {{services in the}} Greater Dublin Area. These include members of staff checking tickets and smartcards both on-board its trains or at the stations.|$|R
50|$|Inspectors {{are also}} {{charged with the}} duty of {{investigating}} Railway offences within the codes and practices of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. In the discharge of this duty the Inspector cautions potential <b>fare</b> <b>evaders</b> before interviewing them {{for the purpose of}} reporting the offender for possible prosecution. If found guilty, offenders can currently face a maximum of a £1000 fine or three months in prison.|$|R
50|$|Iarnród Éireann (Irish Rail) issues fixed payment notices on Dublin Area Rapid Transit (DART), Commuter light rail, and InterCity services, per the Railway Safety Act 2005 (Fixed Payment Notice) Regulations 2006. Appeals {{must be made}} within 21 {{days and}} failure to pay {{may lead to a}} {{criminal}} conviction and a fine of up to €1,000 plus the cost of the unpaid fare. In 2014, fixed penalty notices were issued to 9,885 <b>fare</b> <b>evaders,</b> of which 356 were prosecuted in the District Court.|$|R
50|$|Night Network {{commenced}} {{operation on}} 1 January 2016 on a 12-month trail basis. In its first weekend of operation 9,862 myki touch ons were recorded, representing a three-fold increase in patronage {{compared to the}} former NightRider bus system. However, this may understate patronage as it fails to account for <b>fare</b> <b>evaders,</b> those travelling in the free tram zone, and those with periodical tickets {{who may not have}} touched on. The trail was later extended until June 2017, and made permanent in April 2017.|$|R
5000|$|The unified fare system {{includes}} cash {{ticket sales}} (16%), season tickets (from 3 days to a year) (72%) and disabled passengers, combined tickets, <b>fare</b> <b>evaders</b> etc. (12%). In 2011, ticket revenue was 652.2 million Euro. Cash tickets for one ride, {{a day or}} a 3 day pass can be bought at all railway stations, ferry slots or in all buses. There are also [...] "family tickets" [...] (for 2 adults and 3 children) or group tickets for up to 5 adults. The HVV offers job tickets ('ProfiCard'), and semester tickets for the students of all major universities, both heavily discounted. The HVV also offers tickets over mobile phones.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{if there is}} any social stigma associated with ticket-controls in Stockholm’s subway. We used a survey-based model that measures the willingness to pay for a subway card given different types and number of ticket-controls. By comparing the willingness to pay between the different scenarios we obtained the perceived social stigma in local currency (SEK). Our main result is an increase in the willingness to pay for a subway card of SEK 612 per year when controls are associated with social stigma. However, already fare evading respondents do not react as heavily to social stigma as non-fare evaders. These finding suggest that investing in more stigmatizing ticket controls is not preferable since <b>fare</b> <b>evaders</b> will not be affected by it...|$|R
5000|$|She {{has been}} criticized by {{newspapers}} and fellow politicians {{in her role as}} a Minister of Justice, most notably for her part in the change in legislation regulating the National Defence Radio Establishment, as well as her proposal to send lavender-colored envelopes to suspected purchasers of sexual acts, {{with the head of the}} Swedish Bar Association, Anne Ramberg, calling the latter [...] "an unacceptable view of human beings. It is a return to medieval times". After the news of the Swedish police controlling the citizenships of <b>fare</b> <b>evaders</b> in the Stockholm subway, Ask supported the REVA project and continuing in-country foreigner checks. An open letter to the minister describing the more recent public uproar has received worldwide attention, and was carried in the New York Times, written in opposition of police actions in Stockholm.|$|R
40|$|Attacker-Defender Stackelberg {{security}} games (SSGs) {{have emerged}} as an important research area in multi-agent systems. However, existing SSGs models yield fixed, static, schedules which fail in dynamic domains where defenders face execution uncertainty, i. e., in domains where defenders may face unanticipated disruptions of their schedules. A concrete example is an application involving checking fares on trains, where a defender’s schedule is frequently interrupted by <b>fare</b> <b>evaders,</b> making static schedules useless. To address this shortcoming, this paper provides four main contributions. First, we present a novel general Bayesian Stackelberg game model for security resource allocation in dynamic uncertain domains. In this new model, execution uncertainty is handled by using a Markov decision process (MDP) for generating defender policies. Second, we study the problem of computing a Stackelberg equilibrium for this game and exploit problem structure to reduce it to a polynomial-sized optimization problem. Shifting to evaluation, our third contribution shows in simulation that our MDP-based policies overcome the failures of previous SSG algorithms. In so doing, we can now build a complete system, tha...|$|R
5000|$|In late 2007, {{a series}} of attacks against TriMet passengers, {{particularly}} on the MAX Blue Line in Gresham, led to increased public scrutiny of {{the security of the}} Portland transit system as a whole. Fareless Square was called into question as part of this inquiry, as it was alleged that the perpetrators of such offenses were often <b>fare</b> <b>evaders</b> who boarded TriMet in Fareless Square, and who then traveled to other areas (such as Gresham) without paying any fare, and that more stringent fare collection would keep such [...] "undesirables" [...] off the trains. TriMet's general manager proposed limiting the hours of Fareless Square to 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. However, others questioned the logic of linking incidents of crime in Gresham with the existence of a free transit zone located several miles away, in downtown Portland, and TriMet's own statistics showed that in 2007 the agency received very few complaints about activities such as drug dealing and panhandling in Fareless Square. TriMet held two public hearings on January 16, 2008 to help determine the future of Fareless Square but, after receiving a large volume of comment from the public, decided to not make any immediate changes.|$|R
