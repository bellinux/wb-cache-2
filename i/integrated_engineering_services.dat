40|$|The {{entry of}} {{graphical}} engineering data into the Space Station Data Base was examined. Discussed were: representation of graphics objects; representation of connectivity data; graphics capture hardware; graphics display hardware; site-wide distribution of graphics, and consolidation of tools and hardware. A fundamental {{assumption was that}} existing equipment such as IBM based graphics capture software and VAX networked facilities would be exploited. Defensible conclusions reached after study and simulations of use of these systems at the engineering level are: (1) existing IBM based graphics capture software is an adequate and economical means of entry of schematic and block diagram data for present and anticipated electronic systems for Space Station; (2) connectivity data from the aforementioned system may {{be incorporated into the}} envisioned Space Station Data Base with modest effort; (3) graphics and connectivity data captured on the IBM based system may be exported to the VAX network in a simple and direct fashion; (4) graphics data may be displayed site-wide on VT- 125 terminals and lookalikes; (5) graphics hard-copy may be produced site-wide on various dot-matrix printers; and (6) the system may provide <b>integrated</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>services</b> at both the engineering and engineering management level...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{all major}} industrialized countries, {{the service sector}} is the largest {{economic}} segment maintaining the highest growth rate. A current trend in the Internet of Services is to develop and offer {{software as a service}} (SaaS). Some research activities, such as Theseus/TEXO 1, focus on the design and development of Web-based service ecosystems based on Web-platforms which allow offering, trading, and executing of services over the Internet. This paper is based on the <b>Integrated</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Engineering</b> (ISE) methodology, an interdisciplinary methodology for <b>service</b> <b>engineering.</b> The focus of this work is laid on the development of business models from a strategic-/marketoriented perspective, prior to consider the service business processes and the underlying IT-oriented service concept. The role of the business strategist and its objectives is introduced.

40|$|<b>Service</b> <b>Engineering</b> {{comprises}} {{many different}} aspects of defining and creating a service. This especially applies to the Internet of Services (IoS) domain as it is understood by Texo, where services {{are not limited to}} a certain web service technology, abstraction level of functionality or application domain. In this context, service providers are increasingly forced to cooperate to strengthen their core competencies and to create partner networks to offer new services. In order to facilitate the collaboration process, business ecosystems are built which allow service providers to offer their own, as well as combined, electronic services with other providers over the Internet. In Texo, the <b>Integrated</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Engineering</b> methodology (ISE) has been developed which provides a comprehensive, interdisciplinary, and model-driven approach to electronic service development in business ecosystems. One major aim of ISE is to integrate business as well as technical stakeholders in the electronic service development process and support them with appropriate models, methods, and tools...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSamuel(1991) in {{identifying}} {{problems associated with}} engineering education observed that the product of engineering education {{does not have an}} identifiable entity. Unlike professions such as medicine, law or accountancy it is difficult to associate the work of professional engineers with a defined discourse. However the perceptions of professional engineers as occupations that concern themselves with productive processes and wealth creations are increasingly augmented by views of engineering profession as one that is also concerned with environmental issues. This paper takes the view that commitment to sustainability of the end process of engineering work must serve as the ideological core of the engineering profession and therefore issues of sustainability provide the framework for engineering education. One way of enhancing the education of sustainability in engineering curricula is to raise sustainability issues in areas of engineering science. Another way is to <b>integrate</b> <b>engineering</b> subjects through <b>service</b> subject and weave sustainability issues as an aspect of engineering life. This paper takes the view that students’ sustainability consciousness can be raised through service subject such as materials...|$|R
40|$|FICAS, an {{experimental}} Flow-based Infrastructure for Composing Autonomous Services, supports a service-composition paradigm that integrates loosely-coupled software components. The software components [...] processes managed by independent service providers [...] are autonomous services. FICAS employs a distributed data flow that differs markedly from centralized processing adopted by many current service integration frameworks, such as CORBA, J 2 EE and SOAP. Distributed data flows support direct data exchanges among autonomous services, and thus avoid many performance bottlenecks attending centralized processing. The performance and flexibility of FICAS are further improved by adopting active mediation, which distributes computations within the service framework, {{and reduces the}} amount of data traffic significantly by moving computations closer to the data. Several varieties of project management and scheduling software have been aggregated using the FICAS prototype. This demonstration establishes that distributed data flow, combining with active mediation, is more effective and efficient than centralized processing when <b>integrating</b> large <b>engineering</b> software <b>services...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an experimental Flow-based Infrastructure for Composing Autonomous Services (FICAS), which supports a service-composition paradigm that integrates looselycoupled software components. For traditional software service composition frameworks, the data-flows and control-flows are centrally coordinated, and the composed service operates as the hub for all data communications. FICAS, {{on the other}} hand, employs a distributed data flow approach that supports direct data exchanges among web services. The distributed data flows can avoid many performance bottlenecks attending centralized processing. The performance and flexibility of FICAS are further improved by adopting active mediation, which distributes computations within the service framework, and reduces the amount of data traffic significantly by moving computations closer to the data. A system has been prototyped to integrate several project management and scheduling software applications.

40|$|This book {{introduces}} {{the basic principles}} of the <b>Integrated</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Engineering</b> (ISE) framework which is one result of the THESEUS/TEXO project. Firstly, the elementary approaches in the "Internet of Services" are addressed, along with current trends in their development and usage from the viewpoint of IT providers. Secondly, the structures and elements of service lifecycles and their management are described and compared in order to specify which phases of the service lifecycle are covered by ISE. Thirdly, the overall structure of the ISE approach is explained which forms the core of the book. Then, methods and models for the innovation, strategic, conceptual and logical perspectives are shown in further detail. These methods and models are considered as proposals and illustrate the application of ISE. Finally, the use case of a service in the IT outsourcing domain is shown which demonstrates how ISE (the first two perspectives) can be applied in a practical context...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a Flow-based Infrastructure for Composing Autonomous Services (FICAS) that supports a software composition paradigm, where software components are linked together through an integration framework to form composed software applications called megaservices. The software components are provided as processes managed by independent service providers; we call these components autonomous services. FICAS employs a distributed data-flow approach that {{differs from the}} centralized data-flow approach adopted by many current service integration frameworks, such as CORBA, J 2 EE and SOAP. The distributed data-flow approach allows direct data exchange among the autonomous services and consequently facilitates the distribution of computations. FICAS is implemented {{as a collection of}} software modules that support the construction of autonomous services, facilitate the functional composition of autonomous services into megaservices, and carry out the execution of megaservices. We have built a prototype for an information service environment based on FICAS that incorporates a variety of construction project scheduling software. The prototype demonstrates that the distributed data-flow approach is more efficient than the centralized approach when <b>integrating</b> large <b>engineering</b> software <b>services...</b>|$|R
40|$|Application-level {{multi-tenancy}} is {{an architectural}} approach for Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications which enables high operational cost efficiency by sharing one application instance among multiple customer organizations (the so-called tenants). However, {{the focus on}} increased resource sharing typically results in a one-size-fits-all approach. In principle, the shared application instance satisfies only the requirements common to all tenants, without supporting potentially different and varying requirements of these tenants. As a consequence, multi-tenant SaaS applications are inherently limited in terms of flexibility and variability. This paper presents an <b>integrated</b> <b>service</b> <b>engineering</b> method, called <b>service</b> line <b>engineering,</b> that supports co-existing tenant-specific configurations and that facilitates the development and management of customizable, multi-tenant SaaS applications, without compromising scalability. Specifically, the method spans the design, implementation, configuration, composition, operations and maintenance of a SaaS application that bundles all variations {{that are based on}} a common core. We validate this work by illustrating the benefits of our method {{in the development of a}} real-world SaaS offering for document processing. We explicitly show that the effort to configure and compose an application variant for each individual tenant is significantly reduced, though at the expense of a higher initial development effort. status: publishe...|$|R
