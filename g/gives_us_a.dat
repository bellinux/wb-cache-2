The Hungarian, George Bien, author of the Lost Years, also recounts the horrors of Kolyma. His story has also led to a film.|$|E

25|$|The ancient Greek {{custom of}} placing terra cotta miniatures of their {{furniture}} in children's graves <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> {{good idea of}} its style and design. The Greeks normally ate while seated on chairs; benches were used for banquets. The tables, high for normal meals and low for banquets, were initially rectangular in shape. By the 4th century BC, the usual table was round, often with animal-shaped legs (for example lion's paws). Loaves of flat bread {{could be used as}} plates, but terra cotta bowls were more common.|$|E
25|$|The {{nature of}} the {{individual}} nonempty sets in the collection may {{make it possible to}} avoid the axiom of choice even for certain infinite collections. For example, suppose that each member of the collection X is a nonempty subset of the natural numbers. Every such subset has a smallest element, so to specify our choice function we can simply say that it maps each set to the least element of that set. This <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> definite choice of an element from each set, and makes it unnecessary to apply the axiom of choice.|$|E

500|$|James Chapman {{considers}} that Lazenby looks {{the part of}} Bond, identifying his athleticism and [...] "arrogant swagger", which [...] "convey the snobbery of the character". Chapman also distinguished a more vulnerable and human characterisation in Bond—feeling exhausted and falling in love—as opposed to the [...] "heroic superman" [...] of Connery. Brian Fairbanks noted that [...] "OHMSS <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> James Bond capable of vulnerability, {{a man who can}} show fear and is not immune to heartbreak. Lazenby is that man, and his performance is superb". Ben Macintyre also observed that of all the Bonds, Lazenby's characterisation was closest to that of Fleming's original character.|$|E

500|$|Polykleitos {{the elder}} (c.450–420 BC) was a Greek {{sculptor}} {{from the school}} of Argos, and a contemporary of Phidias. His works and statues consisted mainly of bronze and were of athletes. According to the philosopher and mathematician Xenocrates, Polykleitos is ranked {{as one of the}} most important sculptors of Classical antiquity for his work on the Doryphorus and the statue of Hera in the Heraion of Argos. While his sculptures may not be as famous as those of Phidias, they are much admired.

500|$|Vidya's final {{release of}} the year was Sujoy Ghosh's , a sequel Kahaani, {{although}} it narrated a different story. The film was highly anticipated, and critics believed that Vidya's recent spate of poorly received films would come to an end. Kahaani 2, however, was not as well-received as the first film, although Vidya received a Best Actress nomination at Filmfare for her portrayal of a child sexual abuse survivor in the film. Raja Sen thought that despite being an engaging thriller the film's denouement was predictable, but added that [...] "with tremendous commitment to the part, [...] <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> stirring performance free of vanity or obviousness" [...] and praised her [...] "knack for winning the audience over; when she gasps, we gasp".|$|E
500|$|Wordless novel scholar David Beronä saw {{the work}} as a {{catalogue}} of human activity, and in this regard compared it to Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass and Allen Ginsberg's Howl. [...] Austrian writer Stefan Zweig remarked, [...] "If everything were to perish, all the books, monuments, photographs and memoirs, and only the woodcuts that [...] has executed in ten years were spared, our whole present-day world could be reconstructed from them." [...] Critic Chris Lanier attributes the protagonist's appeal to readers to Masereel's avoiding a preaching tone in the work; [...] "rather", Lanier states, [...] "he <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> story as a device through which we can examine ourselves". [...] This openness in the images invites individual interpretation, according to Beronä.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{learning}} about the live telecast, the cast had mixed emotions. Sean Hayes, who plays Jack, was nervous about the episode and hoped there would be cue cards. Debra Messing (Grace) [...] "gasped loudly" [...] when {{it was revealed that}} the technical demands of live television would mean that Burrows would not be directing on the stage floor, but would be up in a booth instead. Messing noted that she had never done live television, but in regards to the live broadcast, said, [...] "It starts out our final season in a real special way."

Khan was pleased to work with Menon and identified with the film due to its [...] "modern, slightly unorthodox take on relationships". He borrowed several real-life experiences for his character, and in preparation, trained at the JW Marriott Hotels in Mumbai. The film received generally positive reviews with several commentators believing that it was Khan's best performance to that point. Anupama Chopra wrote: [...] "Khan get his groove back... doesn’t play Roshan as a hero having a bad day. He <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> flawed, fumbling man {{who is trying to}} repair the broken chords of his life." [...] As with his last few releases, Rangoon and Chef earned little at the box office leading trade analysts to question his commercial appeal.|$|E

Hofstra University program coordinator of astronomy public outreach, professor Donald Lubowich, helped organize the event. Lubowich commented: [...] "Bringing Hofstra's program to the National Mall <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> very special opportunity to encourage children to pursue their interest and science and promote public understanding of science.
