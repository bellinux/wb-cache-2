The players <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on, and the owners <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on. But more important, the players knew that the owners knew—and they knew the owners were doing nothing about it for fear of a scandal that might damage organized baseball. Under such conditions it quite obviously did not pay to be honest.|$|E

500|$|Matters worsened when Columbia Pictures {{experienced}} financial difficulties.

Columbia studio executive John Veich remembered, [...] "If we <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to cost that much, we wouldn't have greenlighted it because we didn't have the money."

500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{columnist}} Abby West lauded the episode, {{writing that}} it [...] "had almost {{everything we could}} want: all the {{major players in the}} mix, an unexpected (not-really) twist, a juicy little revelation, and the short-term promise of a Jim/Pam reunion." [...] She was pleased with the emphasis on Jim and the way he [...] "wonderfully bookended the conflicting emotions Michael inspires."

[...] Chris Carter saw the episode as a transitional episode, stating [...] "I felt that, with [...] "The Sixth Extinction", I was just playing a supporting role and that the episode, essentially the middle episode of a three-episode arc, was just a transitional episode {{to get us to}} '', which was really less about the mythology and more about Mulder's choices in life." ...|$|E

500|$|Dowd {{solved the}} {{recording}} issues by mixing three {{versions of the}} song. Some call-outs of [...] "Shake that thing!" [...] were removed, and the song was split into two three-and-a-half minute sides of a single record, titling the song [...] "What'd I Say PartI" [...] and [...] "What'd I Say PartII". The recorded version divides the parts with a false ending where the orchestra stops and the Raelettes and orchestra members beg Charles to continue, {{then goes on to}} a frenzied finale. Atlantic 45-2031 A side with Part I is 3:05, B side with Part II is 1:59. Dowd later stated after hearing the final recording that not releasing the record was never an option: [...] "we <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be a hit record, no question."

500|$|... "The Pandorica Opens" [...] {{received}} positive reviews. Dan Martin of The Guardian {{praised the}} cinematic scope and cliffhanger, calling it [...] "the most audacious of showstoppers".

Gavin Fuller, writing for The Daily Telegraph, praising it for bringing an [...] "epic, cinematic tale to stick in the memory" [...] that the series had [...] "arguably lacked", though he thought the assembly of the Alliance was [...] "rather fanboyish on Moffat's part".

[...] Most of the exterior shots with the White Walkers and their army took place at Magheramorne, a small hamlet in County Antrim, Northern Ireland near where Castle Black is also filmed. With input from David Benioff and D. B.
