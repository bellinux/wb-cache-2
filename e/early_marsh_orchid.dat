50|$|The site is {{composed}} of several wet meadows, which are grazed by sheep. They are seasonally flooded and waterlogged and have a diverse flora and fauna. Plants include the nationally rare summer snowflake and <b>marsh</b> and <b>early</b> <b>marsh</b> <b>orchids,</b> which are found in locations {{with a long history}} of undisturbed grassland management. There are invertebrates such as the endangered marsh fly Dicheptophora findlandica and the rare dragonfly Gomphus vulgatissimus. There are also areas of wet woodland, and the diverse habitats attract a variety of breeding birds.|$|R

50|$|The fen meadow, {{in which}} blunt-flowered rush, Juncus subnodulosus, is dominant, grades into open flushes. These are carpeted with fern-leaved hook-moss, Cratoneuron filicinum, curled hook-moss, Palustriella commutata, and pointed spear-moss, Calliergon cuspidatum, and support typical fen herbs such as marsh valerian, Valeriana dioica, and <b>early</b> <b>marsh</b> <b>orchid,</b> Dactylorhiza incarnata.|$|E

5000|$|Several orchids of the Dactylorhiza {{species are}} found growing here. Worthy of special mention {{is the common}} western marsh orchid and the {{relatively}} rare <b>early</b> <b>marsh</b> <b>orchid,</b> {{both of which are}} protected and mentioned in the Danish Nature Protection Law ( [...] §3) and the Washington Convention (list II.B). Although the w.m. orchid {{is one of the most}} common orchids in Denmark, it also is included due to alarming population decline.|$|E
50|$|The {{steep slopes}} at Tissø's {{northern}} end {{is also to}} be protected. Here sunloving plants like small pasque flower, sunrose and dwarf everlast are found, with the rare and threatened fragrant scabious in between. The meadows below the cliffs are also of botanical interest, supporting plants like marsh lousewort, bog-star and various true sedges like blue sedge along with orchids like <b>early</b> <b>marsh</b> <b>orchid,</b> western marsh orchid and marsh helleborine, in a biotope of calcium-rich springs.|$|E
50|$|A {{comparison}} of vegetation surveys of Scotstown Moor, performed in 1968 and 1998, {{shows that the}} number of plant species in the area has declined. Species have been lost from all habitat types, although those of the open water and open/waste ground have suffered the most. For example, marsh arrowgrass (Triglochin palustris), <b>early</b> <b>marsh</b> <b>orchid</b> (Dactylorhiza incarnata), common twayblade (Listera cordata), corn spurrey (Spergula arvensis) and various species of dead nettle (Lamium spp.) have all been lost from the site.|$|E

50|$|Dactylorhiza praetermissa, the {{southern}} <b>marsh</b> <b>orchid</b> or leopard <b>marsh</b> <b>orchid,</b> is a commonly occurring species of European orchid.

50|$|As {{with many}} marsh plants, {{the numbers of}} this species have been dwindling for quite some time. The main causes are the entry of {{nitrogen}} via fertilizer, drying out of the habitat, and intensive conversion to pasture. The western marsh orchid does not react so sensitively to changes in its habitat as for example the <b>early</b> <b>marsh</b> <b>orchid,</b> Dactylorhiza incarnata. It is usually {{the last of the}} native orchids to disappear. This tolerance makes it a still relatively common species.|$|E
50|$|Several {{areas of}} former gravel pit have been {{infilled}} with power station pulverised fuel ash, {{much of which}} was transported to the site by barge via the River Lee Navigation. Much of the reclaimed land is poorly drained and exerts a strong calcareous influence on the vegetation. The area supports {{some of the largest}} colonies of marsh orchid in Essex and Hertfordshire. Other orchids present in large numbers are the <b>early</b> <b>marsh</b> <b>orchid</b> and southern marsh orchid, also present in smaller numbers are the common spotted orchid and various hybrids between these species.|$|E
50|$|There are eleven meadows {{which are}} on {{alluvium}} and Lower Lias clays near {{the confluence of}} the Rivers Eye and Dikler. The citation states they are one of the richest and largest traditional meadow systems remaining in the Cotswolds. The meadows are divided by well developed ancient hedges and there are occasional hedgerow trees. The meadows which make up the SSSI support a wide range of species. These include southern marsh orchid and <b>early</b> <b>marsh</b> <b>orchid.</b> They support great burnet, cuckoo flower, quaking grass, ragged robin, pepper saxifrage and meadow rue. Wetland species grow alongside the River Eye. These include yellow iris, marsh marigold and meadowsweet.|$|E

50|$|Nob End was {{designated}} as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) (file designation SD70/2) in 1988, under Section 28 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act, 1981. and as a Local Nature Reserve (LNR) in 2000. The contamination of the land from the old chemical works with waste from the Leblanc process has resulted in an alkaline soil that now supports a variety of plants not found elsewhere in Greater Manchester, including many types of orchid, most notable amongst these are Fragrant orchid Gymnadenia conopsea, the Northern Marsh orchid Dactylorhiza purpurella, the <b>Early</b> <b>Marsh</b> <b>orchid</b> Dactylorhiza incarnata and other species such as Common Broomrape, Twayblade, Blue fleabane and Carline thistle. The reserve covers 8.8 hectares (21 acres).|$|E
50|$|The {{nature reserve}} lies close to Sandemar Castle and the {{landscape}} is characterised by having {{been part of the}} manorial estate for a long time. The area is considered {{to be one of the}} foremost examples in Stockholm County of such a landscape. It includes coastal meadows rich in bird-life and a rich fen situated in the eastern part of the reserve. The fen is regularly tended to in order to preserve its special flora and fauna, which includes <b>early</b> <b>marsh</b> <b>orchid,</b> fen orchid, marsh helleborine and the carnivorous common butterwort. The coastal meadows contain stands of elder-flowered orchid and Fritillaria meleagris, and the flat meadows and shallow water is also an important habitat for birds. For the convenience of visitors, a bird watching tower has been built not far from the water's edge. The nature reserve is part of the EU-wide Natura 2000-network.|$|E
5000|$|Lindisfarne National Nature Reserve protects {{a stretch}} of coastline, {{including}} the dunes of Lindisfarne (Holy Island). Lindisfarne NNR has international recognition and covers a large and varied mosaic of internationally recognised and important coastal habitats. These include intertidal mudflats, rocky shore, sand dunes and salt marshes. The dunes of the Lindisfarne National Nature Reserve support many plants. Early forget-me-nots and marram grass are among those that hug the ground and need little water. Many species of insects, moths, and butterflies appreciate this environment, including the 'woolly bears' (tiger moth caterpillars). Dark green fritillary, and grayling butterflies bask in the sun during July and August in the Lindisfarne NNR. Big brown-lipped snails can also be found. During early summer, the purple northern marsh orchid flourishes along with its pinker relation, the <b>early</b> <b>marsh</b> <b>orchid.</b> In July the marsh helleborines flower by the thousands and form spectacular white carpets. [...] Recently a unique orchid, the Lindisfarne helleborine, has been discovered on the island. The plants were formerly identified as dune helleborine (Epipactis dunensis), but DNA analysis carried out in 2003 revealed them to be genetically distinct, and the new species was given the scientific name Epipactis sancta.|$|E
