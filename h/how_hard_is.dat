5000|$|Whenappealing to {{findings}} from empirically well-grounded disciplines, philosophers face a strong temptation to overstate their case — especially if their philosophical opponents can be relied {{on to be}} relatively innocent of {{new developments in the}} relevant science. I fear that some B-theorists have succumbed to the temptation, judging by the relish with which they often pronounce a verdict based on Relativity. They can practically hear the crunch of the lowly metaphysician’s armor giving way, as they bring the full force of incontrovertible physical fact down upon our A-theoretically-addled heads. But what actually hits us, and <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>is</b> the blow? SR is false; GR’s future is highly uncertain; and the presentist’s conflict with either version of Relativity is shallow, since the presentist’s manifold can satisfy the same geometrical description as a B-theorist’s manifold, and afford explanations of all the same phenomena in precisely the same style. In these circumstances, how could appeal to SR or GR justify the frequent announcements that the A-theory-B-theory dispute has been “settled by physics, not philosophy”? Dean Zimmerman ...|$|E
5000|$|Trenton Webb {{reviewed}} On Hallowed Ground for Arcane magazine, rating it a 6 out of 10 overall. Webb {{begins the}} review by saying: [...] "God does exist. It says so in On Hallowed Ground, a new Planescape tome which proceeds to lay bare the dark on every deity in the multiverse, detailing their powers, potential, {{phone number and}} e-mail address. In essence Planescape is the unifying setting for all the official AD&D worlds, and these established settings sit alongside Planescapes own unique planes. Together they supply the variety and extremes that make travelling the multiverse so exciting. The downside about this catch-all position is {{that the system is}} honour bound to obey all the other systems dictates, rules and various foibles." [...] He commented: [...] "This doesnt pose a problem on a basic level because each plane is a totally contained, self-sufficient system and play obeys the local rules. Gods, however, make for some major problems because the influence of these big boys extends beyond their home plane." [...] Webb continues: [...] "Hallowed Grounds solution is to supply functional details of the various pantheons and their patches, to serve as a source and setting for Planescape adventures. These descriptions are then supported by a theological system thats palatable and logical enough to tackle the thorny problem of the simultaneous existence of several supreme beings. The godly descriptions combine excellent information and characterful portraits. Dealt with on a pantheon by pantheon basis, the attitudes and aims of all significant powers - demi, lesser, intermediate and greater - are explained with clear brevity. It doesnt get weighed down trying to explain hit dice, spell lists or special attacks because theres no need. These guys are Gods and no character, no matter <b>how</b> <b>hard,</b> <b>is</b> going to fight them and win. The interaction that will happen will take the form of omens, via proxies, or if players are very lucky conversations with the big man himself. And theres information aplenty for that kind of tomfoolery. The theology of Hallowed Ground is progressive, clearly explaining just how priests gain spells and the benefits to be had from planar proximity to a chosen one. The suggested optional rules, though, dont do enough to balance the priests loss of levels, suffered for straying far from his Gods home, to make clerics an enjoyable class to play in a Planescape setting." [...] He added: [...] "The suggested Power Key solution to this problem, whereby Gods can give priests artefacts that allow them to cast their spells at full power wherever they are, is intriguing though. The award of one to any player priest will not only supply great roleplay opportunity, but motive power for all manner of holy quests." [...] Webb concluded his review by saying, [...] "On Hallowed Ground is an excellent book, but far from an essential purchase because the opportunities to use its information are so rare. Whats more, the very clarity of its theology could make the lives of Planescape player priests far too complex to be any fun." ...|$|E

People from Romania, do not want to buy albums, so Delia resumed the idea of releasing only singles from 2008. Of late, she was more active after the split with Matteo, a local singer.
