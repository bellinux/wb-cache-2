2500|$|... 2007: The World Bank's <b>Inspection</b> <b>Panel</b> {{investigated}} {{the practices of}} the World Bank in the rainforest in the Democratic Republic of Congo following a request from indigenous groups working in partnership with RFN and the Rainforest Foundation UK. The Panel highlighted a series of failures {{on the part of}} the Bank to comply with its own internal environmental and social policies and safeguards, to recognize the importance of the forests for the subsistence and sustainable development of the people who live in and depend on them, and to promote truly sustainable approaches to forest management. The Panel concluded that the World Bank's bias in favor of industrial logging impoverished local people, and that the Bank should rethink its approach to forest management and develop a policy based on true participation of forest-based peoples, with the aim of securing their traditional rights and promoting alternatives to industrial logging. The Inspection Panel's investigation of the allegedly unsustainable forest policies of the World Bank garnered significant international attention, with the Norwegian Agency for Development Coordination subsequently stating that [...] "it can [...] truly be said that RFN and its partners [...] turned around the entire forest and indigenous policies of this huge African country".|$|E

The D.520's cockpit was set well back in the fuselage, aft of the trailing edge of the wings.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{geometric}} modeling of illumination on the patterned image containing etching transistor. This image is captured by a commercial camera during the inspection of a TFT-LCD <b>panel.</b> <b>Inspection</b> of defect {{is an important}} process {{in the production of}} LCD panel, but the regional difference in brightness, which has a negative effect on the inspection, is due to the uneven illumination environment. In order to solve this problem, we present a geometric modeling of illumination consisting of an interpolation using the least squares method and 3 D modeling using bezier surface. Our computational time, by using the sampling method, is shorter than the previous methods. Moreover, it can be further used to correct brightness in every patterned image.

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 One of the {{commonly}} used simulation approaches is process orientation. This {{is based on}} the use of nodes (or blocks) that perform functions in series. In spite of the compactness and ease of learning that characterize process-based simulation, many languages are somewhat complex, primarily the result of the large number of nodes that users have to deal with and the considerable gulf between a user's abstract notion of the model and the details required to implement it. This paper describes a process-based simulation system that integrates object-oriented programming, visual interactive simulation and graphical model specification. Object-oriented programming techniques and simulation seem to be a natural match. The process classes are represented as network blocks or network nodes, and the process as a network diagram or directed graph. Arcs connect the nodes and specify {{the next step in the}} process. Each block type has its own icon. Developing an application model requires selecting a set of nodes, connecting them, and specifying the parameters (such as activity durations and random number streams) of the nodes through dialog boxes or <b>inspection</b> <b>panels.</b> Nodes have been designed to accomplish the major requirements in simulation modeling, including creation and termination of entities, attribute assignment, branching, queues and resources, activity specification and statistics collection and display. Additional system features include: statistics manipulation for steady state results, execution trace utilities, and limited animation capabilities. The system has been implemented for the NeXT programming environment using Objective-C. The NeXT includes an extensive object-oriented user interface library, relatively powerful hardware, and a modern multi-tasking and virtual memory operating system. Objective-C allows object-oriented concepts such as inheritance and subclassing while adding only a few constructs to that of the C language. The system modeling environment developed in this research enhances the applicability and usability of high level modeling tools. The program also provides a platform for further work on the distribution of the modeling process over several cooperating, communicating applications...|$|R

The Panel provides a forum for {{people who believe that}} they may be adversely affected by Bank-financed operations to bring their concerns to the highest decision-making levels of the World Bank. The Panel determines whether the Bank is complying with its own policies and procedures, which are designed to ensure that Bank-financed operations provide social and environmental benefits and avoid harm to people and the environment. The <b>Inspection</b> <b>Panel</b> was the first body to promote accountability among international financial institutions through this community-led, or “bottom-up”, approach which is complementary to the “top-down” forms of accountability, such as evaluation initiated by the World Bank itself. Building on this example, other multilateral and regional financial institutions have established similar accountability mechanisms as part of broader efforts at sustainable and equitable development.|$|E
