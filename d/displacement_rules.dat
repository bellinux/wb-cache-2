Although sensorimotor learning has been described previously in bees and a few ant species, its potential importance for navigation has often been underestimated. Motor memories independent of landmark identification could nevertheless prove useful for ants such as the tropical species Gigantiops destructor that forages in visually complex environments. We tested the sensorimotor learning ability of these ants using unmarked Y-mazes of increasing difficulty: constant-turn mazes, simple and double alternation mazes and irregular mazes. In the absence of visual cues, the ants were able to learn not only motor <b>displacement</b> <b>rules</b> but also route-specific patterns of movement. The ants' preference for simple navigation strategies was also demonstrated by their tendency to use a simple repetitive motor rule different from the rule {{they were expected to}} learn. These findings suggest that relying on different sensorimotor memories eliminates the need to form, store and retrieve numerous landmark views along foraging routes, which are potentially cognitively demanding and time consuming in naturally cluttered environments...|$|E
40|$|Recently, Charnov (1996) {{investigated}} {{the consequences of}} sperm competition for optimal sex allocation in simultaneous hermaphrodites. Charnov argued that the optimal sex allocation strategy can be derived {{on the basis of}} the `sperm displacement rule'; that is, the function describing the relationship between sperm production and sperm displacement. Based on three specific examples of such sperm <b>displacement</b> <b>rules,</b> Charnov claimed that the details of the relationship between ejaculate volume and sperm displacement have only a minor eVect on the optimal sex allocation strategy. We demonstrate that this `invariance principle' is less general than suggested. The optimal sex allocation strategy as a function of the dimensionless quantity # (ratio of maximum sperm volume to sperm storage volume) can have a wide variety of shapes. This is because Charnov's results depend crucially on two assumptions of questionable generality: diminishing displacement with investment in sperm and linear fitness returns with investment in eggs. We argue that deeper insights into optimal sex allocation are obtained if the allocation decision is partitioned into multiple components. Using this approach, we find a novel invariance principle: if egg survival only depends on the investment per egg (and not on clutch size), then the shape of this relationship has no eVect whatsoever on optimal allocation to eggs versus sperm...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{rheology}} of granular {{materials is}} largely dominated by geometrical constraints arising from steric exclusions and involving particle shapes and size distributions. This prevailing role of geometry permits one to simplify sometimes the dynamics {{in favor of}} a better description of the geometry or/and higher numerical efficiency. For example, a dense granular packing may be efficiently constructed by replacing the equations of dynamics by simple <b>displacement</b> <b>rules</b> satisfying the geometrical constraints. Such purely geometrical procedures can be much simpler and numerically faster than more realistic procedures employed in dynamic methods and quasistatic methods. The issue of the assembling methods is to construct configurations of particles {{as close as possible to}} a state of mechanical equilibrium with built-in packing properties. This can be, for example, a target packing fraction for a given particle size distribution. In the same way, the average connectivity of the particles (coordination number) and the anisotropy of the contact network are basic geometrical properties that control the mechanical response of a packing and may be built into a packing by an appropriate method. The homogeneity of the particle assembly in terms of packing fraction and connectivity is another important property which depends on the assembling rules. In this chapter, several basic assembling methods by simple geometrical rules will be introduced. As there is a close link between the particle size distribution (PSD) and texture of a granular packing, particle size distribution we also present a method for the generation of PSD and we discuss in detail their statistical representativity and influence on the packing properties...|$|E

In the construction of housing, demand of land is huge. One source of land is resumption of old area and land. Land users or owners had much conflict with government and real estate developers in land resumption and displacement issue {{in the past few}} years. This study investigates the difference of land resumption and displacement method between Hong Kong and Shanghai. This can provide information for Shanghai government to evaluate its policy and take Hong Kong as a good reference. It is because there were many problems and conflicts like imbalance of interest sharing between land users and government and real estate developers that were caused by unfair land resumption and displacement regulations and procedures. In the beginning, concepts of property rights, rent seeking, eminent domain in United States are investigated. Also Hong Kong land tenure system, letter A/B, and situation in Shanghai are included. This shows the property rights are mature in United States and Hong Kong. Shanghai is comparatively weak in this concept. In the eminent domain concept, United States and Hong Kong are fully developed, but it is still weak in Shanghai. In the methodology, I compare the land resumption and <b>displacement</b> <b>rules</b> and regulations of Hong Kong and Shanghai. In Hong Kong, those are Urban Renewal Authority Ordinance, Lands Resumption Ordinance. While in Shanghai, they are Shanghai city land displacement housing management method, Urban Buildings Demolition Relocation Administration Regulations. By the results, we can see the system in Hong Kong is much more mature and complicate than that of Shanghai. Shanghai should consider the fairness and justice concept of Hong Kong land resumption and displacement regulations to modify its regulations. Example is like involving more parties in the land resumption procedure to monitor each other and minimize the chance of interest of conflict. At last, some suggestions are made to Shanghai government. One is law court should be only responsible for judgment, while execution is done by other party. Although there are some limitations of this study like the rapid changing of land resumption and displacement regulations in Shanghai, this study still provide some valuable information for the development of real estate industry in China. published_or_final_versionHousing ManagementMasterMaster of Housing Managemen...|$|E

40|$|The ATC- 40 and FEMA- 274 {{documents}} contain simplified {{nonlinear analysis}} procedures {{to determine the}} displacement demand imposed on a building expected to deform inelastically. The Nonlinear Static Procedure in these documents, based on the capacity spectrum method, involves several approximations: The lateral force distribution for pushover analysis and conversion of these results to the capacity diagram are based only on the fundamental vibration mode of the elastic system. The earthquake-induced deformation of an inelastic SDF system is estimated by an iterative method requiring analysis of a sequence of equivalent linear systems, thus avoiding the dynamic analysis of the inelastic SDF system. This last approximation is first evaluated in this report, followed {{by the development of}} an improved simplified analysis procedure, based on capacity and demand diagrams, to estimate the peak deformation of inelastic SDF systems. Several deficiencies in ATC- 40 Procedure A are demonstrated. This iterative procedure did not converge for some of the systems analyzed. It converged in many cases, but to a deformation much different than dynamic (nonlinear response history or inelastic design spectrum) analysis of the inelastic system. The ATC- 40 Procedure B always gives a unique value of deformation, the same as that determined by Procedure A if it converged. The peak deformation of inelastic systems determined by ATC- 40 procedures are shown to be inaccurate when compared against results of nonlinear response history analysis and inelastic design spectrum analysis. The approximate procedure underestimates significantly the deformation {{for a wide range of}} periods and ductility factors with errors approaching 50 %, implying that the estimated deformation is about half the “exact” value. Surprisingly, the ATC- 40 procedure is deficient relative to even the elastic design spectrum in the velocity-sensitive and displacement-sensitive regions of the spectrum. For periods in these regions, the peak deformation of an inelastic system can be estimated from the elastic design spectrum using the well-known equal <b>displacement</b> <b>rule.</b> However, the approximate procedure requires analyses of several equivalent linear systems and still produces worse results. Finally, an improved capacity-demand-diagram method that uses the well-known constant-ductility design spectrum for the demand diagram has been developed and illustrated by examples. This method gives the deformation value consistent with the selected inelastic design spectrum, while retaining the attraction of graphical implementation of the ATC- 40 methods. One version of the improved method is graphically similar to ATC- 40 Procedure A whereas a second version is graphically similar to ATC- 40 Procedure B. However, the improved procedures differ from ATC- 40 procedures in one important sense. The demand is determined by analyzing an inelastic system in the improved procedure instead of equivalent linear systems in ATC- 40 procedures. The improved method can be conveniently implemented numerically if its graphical features are not important to the user. Such a procedure, based on equations relating Ry and µ for different T n ranges, has been presented, and illustrated by examples using three different Ry - µ - T n relations...|$|R

This thesis presents the first comprehensive analysis of small (reliable measurements of engine performance and losses in these small engines. Methodologies are also developed for measuring volumetric, heat transfer, exhaust, mechanical, and combustion losses. These instruments and techniques are used to investigate the performance of seven single-cylinder, two-stroke, glow fueled engines {{ranging in size from}} 15 to 450 g (0. 16 to 7. 5 cm 3 <b>displacement).</b> Scaling <b>rules</b> for power output, overall efficiency, and normalized power are developed from the data. These will be useful to developers of micro-air vehicles and miniature power systems. The data show that the minimum length scale of a thermodynamically viable piston engine based on present technology is approximately 3 mm. Incomplete combustion is the most important challenge as it accounts for 60 - 70 % of total energy losses. Combustion losses are followed in order of importance by heat transfer, sensible enthalpy, and friction. A net heat release analysis based on in-cylinder pressure measurements suggest that a two-stage combustion process occurs at low engine speeds and equivalence ratios close to 1. Different theories based on burning mode and reaction kinetics are proposed to explain the observed results. High speed imaging of the combustion chamber suggests that a turbulent premixed flame with its origin {{in the vicinity of the}} glow plug is the primary driver of combustion. Placing miniature IC engines on a turbulent combustion regime diagram shows that they operate in the 'flamelet in eddy' regime whereas conventional-scale engines operate mostly in the 'wrinkled laminar flame sheet' regime. Taken together, the results show that the combustion process is the key obstacle to realizing the potential of small IC engines. Overcoming this obstacle will require new diagnostic techniques, measurements, combustion models, and high temperature materials...|$|R

In order to facilitate the design process of achieving robustness in simple beam-to-column connection, a componentbased model has been developed for fin-plate connections in this research. The new model represents the realistic behaviour of such connections {{under the influence of}} combined forces, together with the high rotations which can occur at the ends of beams, during building fires. The key aspect of the component method is that it characterises the force-displacement properties of each active component at any temperature, as a nonlinear "spring". The temperature-dependent characteristics of each individual component in each bolt row are defined, including the failure mechanism of the weakest component, based on experimental and analytical findings. Primary failure modes adopted for fin plate connections are bearing/block shear of the plates and bolt shear. A major additional complication is force reversal in components, which may occur simply because of temperature change, without any physical reversal of <b>displacement.</b> The Massing <b>Rule</b> has been adopted to incorporate the effect of permanent deformations at any temperature when force reversal occurs. To account for the bolt slip phases, force transitions between tensile and compressive quadrants take place only when positive contact between a bolt and the edge of its bolt hole is re-established. The results of high-temperature tests on the fin-plate connections have been used to verifY the model for isolated joints at ambient and elevated temperatures. The developed component model for the fin-plate connection has been extended for the application of moment-resisting beam splice connection, also known as the "column-tree" system. The component-based connection model has also been used to study joint behaviour in structural sub-frame analyses. Incorporating it into non-linear finite element software will enable engineers to generate the global structural interactions for steel and composite structures in fire scenarios, up to and including connection failure. The new connection element has been validated with reasonable agreement with the available experimental data, showing its capability of capturing the key features of the overall connection interaction in a realistic manner, based on the underlying mechanics, coupled with evidence from experimental data.

40|$|Growing {{number of}} {{applications}} of composites materials in aerospace and naval structures along with advancements in manufacturing technologies demand continuous innovations in design of composite structures. In the traditional design of composite laminates, fiber orientation angles are constant for each layer and are usually limited to 0, 90, and 45 degrees. To fully benefit from the directional properties of composite laminates, such limitations have to be removed. The concept of variable-stiffness laminates allows the stiffness properties to vary spatially over the laminate. Through tailoring of fiber orientations and laminate thickness spatially in an optimal fashion, mechanical properties of a part can be improved. In this thesis, optimal design of variable-stiffness fiber-reinforced composite laminates was studied using an emerging numerical engineering optimization scheme based on cellular automata paradigm. Cellular Automata (CA) based design scheme uses local update rules for both field variables (displacements) and design variables (lay-up configuration and laminate density measure) in an iterative fashion to convergence to an optimal design. In the present work, the displacements are updated {{based on the principle}} of local equilibrium and the design variables are updated according to the optimality criteria for minimum compliance design. A closed form <b>displacement</b> update <b>rule</b> for constant thickness isotropic continua was derived, while for the general anisotropic continua with variable thickness a numeric update rule was used. Combined lay-up and topology design of variable-stiffness flat laminates was performed under the action of in-plane loads and bending loads. Optimality criteria based formulation was used to obtain local design rules for minimum compliance design subject to a volume constraint. It was shown that the design rule splits into a two-step application. In the first step an optimal lay-up configuration was computed and in the second step the density measure was obtained. The spatial lay-up design problem was formulated using both fiber angles and lamination parameters as design variables. A weighted average formulation was used to handle multiple load case designs. Numerical studies were conducted to investigate the performance of the proposed design methodology. It was shown that the optimal lay-up configuration is independent of the lattice density with more details emerging as the density is increased. Moreover, combined topology and lay-up designs were free of checkerboard patterns. The lay-up design problem was also solved using lamination parameters, instead of the fiber orientation angles. The use of lamination parameters has two key features; first the convexity of the minimization problem guarantees a global minimum; second for the in-plane and also for the bending problem it limits the number of design variables to four regardless of the actual number of layers thereby simplifying the optimization task. Moreover, it improves the convergence rate of the iterative design scheme as compared to using fiber angles as design variables, and provides a theoretically better design; however, manufacturability of the designs are not certain. Cases of general, balanced symmetric, and balanced symmetric with equal thickness layers were studied separately. The feasible domain for laminates with equal thickness layers was presented for an increasing number of layers. A restricted problem was proposed which maintains the convexity of the design space for laminates with equal thickness layers. A recursive formulation for computing fiber angles for this case was also presented. On the computational side of the effort, a parallel version of the present CA formulation was implemented on message passing multi-processor clusters. It was shown that a standard parallel implementation does not converge for an increased number of processors. Detailed analysis revealed that the convergence problem was due to a Jacobi iteration scheme, and a pure Gauss-Seidel through a pipeline implementation completely resolved the convergence problem. Timing results giving the speedup for the pipeline implementation were obtained for up to 260 processors. Aerospace Engineerin...|$|R
