40|$|A {{percentage}} of all chondrules from carbonaceous chondrites are intermediate in major-element composition between the rare Ca,Al-rich chondrules {{and the more}} abundant ferromagnesian chondrules. Some of them possess fractionated REE and trace-element patterns {{similar to those in}} CAI's (Ca-Al-rich inclusions). The abundance patterns are controlled primarily by volatilities expected from a solar composition. On the basis of refractory lithophile fractionations, it is suggested that one of the refractory precursors of C chondrules is a condensate from the nebular gas or an <b>evaporative</b> <b>residue</b> of primitive dust clumps...|$|E

The energy spectra of light charged particles (LCP) in coincidence with one-, 2 - or many-body residues have been analyzed.

40|$|The Type B Ca-Al-rich {{inclusions}} in the Allende {{carbonaceous chondrite}} form a continuous {{range from the}} mineralogically concentrically zoned B 1 subtype to the unzoned B 2 subtype. These subtypes differ in (1) structure, texture, grain size and shape, (2) mineralogical proportions and compositions, (3) accessory mineralogy, (4) relative abundance of spinel framboids, (5) rim layering, (6) major element chemistry, and (7) degree of secondary alteration. These differences, together with observations on the crystallization of synthetic melts, suggest that the B 1 inclusions crystallized relatively rapidly from molten parental material while B 2 types crystallized relatively slowly close to the solidus from material {{that had not been}} completely melted. The same data are used to construct an <b>evaporative</b> <b>residue</b> model for the origin of the parental Type B materials. In the model, dust in the protosolar nebula was heated with removal of more volatile elements, leaving completely melted (Type B 1) residues at the highest temperatures and incompletely melted, less highly evaporated (Type B 2) residues at lower temperatures...|$|E
40|$|The high-Al (> 28 wt %), silica-poor (< 45 wt %) (HASP) feldspathic {{glasses of}} Apollo 16 are widely {{regarded}} as the <b>evaporative</b> <b>residues</b> of impacts in the lunar regolith [1 - 3]. By virtue of their small size, apparent homogeneity, and high inferred formation temperatures, the HASP glasses appear to be good samples in which to study fractionation processes that may accompany open system evaporation. Calculations suggest that HASP glasses with present-day Al 2 O 3 concentrations of up to 40 wt% may have lost 19 wt% of their original masses, calculated as the oxides of iron and silicon, via evaporation [4]. We report Mg and Si isotope abundances in 10 HASP glasses and 2 impact-glass spherules from a 64 - 105 m grain-size fraction taken from Apollo 16 soil sample 61241...|$|R
40|$|A waste {{material}} from an aggregate producing quarry {{has been used}} to make an inexpensive lunar simulant called BP- 1. The feedstock is the Black Point lava flow in northern Arizona. Although {{this is part of the}} San Francisco volcanic field, which is also the source of the JSC- 1 series feedstock, BP- 1 and JSC- 1 are distinct. Chemically, the Black Point flow is an amygdaloidal nepheline-bearing basalt. The amygdules are filled with secondary minerals containing opaline silica, calcium carbonate, and ferric iron minerals. X-ray diffraction (XRD) detected approximately 3 % quartz, which is in line with tests done by the Kennedy Space Center Industrial Hygiene Office. Users of this material should use appropriate protective equipment. XRD also showed the presence of significant halite and some bassanite. Both are interpreted to be <b>evaporative</b> <b>residues</b> due to recycling of wash water at the quarry. The size distribution of BP- 1 may be superior to some other simulants for some applications...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Experiments {{demonstrate}} that partial evaporation of solid silica at 1600 – 1700 °C and low pressure (1029 bar) results in enrichment of 18 O/ 16 O and 17 O/ 16 O in solid products. <b>Evaporative</b> <b>residues</b> formed in H 2 or N 2 gas at higher pressures (. 1025 bar) exhibit limited or negligible heavy isotope enrichment. The {{degree of enrichment}} is controlled by kinetic fractionation at the ablating grain surfaces, the rate of sublimation, and the efficacy of oxygen self diffusion in the solid. Observed isotopic effects are consistent with numerical simulations, confirming that vaporization of solid silicate and oxide minerals is a viable cause for non-Rayleigh fractionation of 16 O, 17 O, and 18 O. Experiment and theory suggest that partial melting during evaporation is not required a priori to explain mass-dependent variations in oxygen isotope ratios in primitive meteoritical materials. Experimental determinations of the rates of ablation of appropriate minerals are required to evaluate the meteoritical data. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} asphalt {{emulsion}} needs a fundamental {{knowledge of the}} {{physical and chemical properties}} of emulsion. This work investigate different <b>evaporative</b> <b>residue</b> recovery methods as they relate not only to macro scale properties but also to the asphalt microstructure and nano-rheology. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the application of dynamic shear rheometer for macro scale and the application of atomic force microscopy imaging for nano-scale. Extraction of nano-scale engineering properties, i. e. dissipated energy, elastic modulus, adhesion force provide information for prediction of performance related characteristics. This work implements the framework of mechanics by investigating two different solution, elastic and viscoelastic as they relate not only to macro-scale properties of the binder but also to the binder microstructure. It was revealed that different evaporative recovery methods induces substantial microstructural changes in residual binder, i. e. phase distribution, phase percentage, phase structure. It has also been shown that mechanical behavior of asphalt microstructure correlates with bulk behavior of the binder through experimental measurements and finite element modeling techniques. The rheological properties of binders are now commonly used in materials specifications and are used as input to the Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG). Therefore, an approach of using predictive models to estimate the rheological properties of the bituminous materials accurately would be useful for the pavement design. In this study, a modeling approach is proposed which is based on fundamental viscoelastic principles. To establish the models, a large data set that was obtained from multiple existing national efforts across the United States was used. The database consists of measured modulus values from mixtures with modified and unmodified binders, and mixtures having various amounts of reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP). As a result, two predictive models were developed to estimate the binder shear modulus and phase angle given the desired physical and mechanical properties of asphalt mixtures. These models can be used {{for a wide range of}} temperatures (covering - 10 ? up to 54. 4 ?C) that are recommended in the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) TP 62 - 03 test protocol. It is believed that the aforementioned findings of this study can lead to enhance the knowledge of rheological properties of binders in RAP mixtures at intermediate and high temperatures without the need to extract binder from mixture...|$|E
40|$|Plagioclase-Olivine Inclusions (POIs) are an {{abundant}} group of chondrule-like objects with igneous textures found in carbonaceous chondrites. POIs consist of plagioclase, olivine, pyroxene, and spinel, and cover {{a wide range}} of compositions between Type C Ca-Al-rich Inclusions (CAIs) and ferromagnesian chondrules. POIs are distinguished from CAIs by the absence of melilite, lack of refractory siderophile-rich opaque assemblages, more sodic plagioclase, and abundance of olivine and aluminousenstatite. Rare accessory minerals including armalcolite, zirconolite, rutile, and sapphirine are found in several POIs. The petrographie and chemical properties of POIs indicate that they are not condensates or <b>evaporative</b> <b>residues</b> but formed by melting or partial melting of pre-existing solids. Seven of fourteen POIs contain isotopically fractionated Mg, and despite their textures these POIs are not isotopically homogeneous. Spinel is the major carrier of fractionated Mg in six POIs. The magnitude of Mg isotopic fractionation (FMg) of spinel ranges from − 8 to + 11 %. /amu among the POIs but F_(Mg) is always either positive or negative within an individual POL Within a single inclusion, F_(Mg) of coexisting spinel is not constant but varies by up to 7 %. /amu. Isotopic fractionation of Mg in silicates is less common and always positive (F_(Mg) > 0). Pyroxenes in two POIs and plagioclase in a third contain isotopically heavy Mg. Radiogenic ^(26) Mg∗ is rare in POIs as only two inclusions show evidence of excess ^(26) Mg with ^(26) Mg^∗/^(27) Al ~ 4 × 10 ^(− 6). The preservation of isotopic heterogeneity in objects whose igneous textures suggest crystallization from a homogeneous melt implies that melting was incomplete, allowing survival of relict phases. A comparison of the essential characteristics of POIs and CAIs suggests that the major processes leading to formation of POIs—including condensation, dust/gas fractionation, aggregation of chemically and isotopically disparate materials, and partial melting—are common to most CAIs and chondrules. We present a scenario for the formation of these objects and conclude that the homogeneity of the final assemblage—CAI, POI, or chondrule—is primarily a reflection of the thermal history rather than the nature of precursor materials...|$|R
