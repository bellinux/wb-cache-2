5|$|An {{example of}} a {{medicinal}} enzyme inhibitor is sildenafil (Viagra), a common treatment for male erectile dysfunction. This compound is a potent inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5, the <b>enzyme</b> <b>that</b> degrades the signalling molecule cyclic guanosine monophosphate. This signalling molecule triggers smooth muscle relaxation and allows blood flow into the corpus cavernosum, which causes an erection. Since the drug decreases {{the activity of the}} <b>enzyme</b> <b>that</b> halts the signal, it makes this signal last {{for a longer period of}} time.|$|E
5|$|In 2016 a {{synthetic}} peptide-conjugated PMO (PPMO) {{was found to}} inhibit the expression of New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase, an <b>enzyme</b> <b>that</b> many drug-resistant bacteria use to destroy carbapenems.|$|E
5|$|A {{very well}} {{understood}} example of extrinsic control is {{the regulation of}} glucose metabolism by the hormone insulin. Insulin is produced in response to rises in blood glucose levels. Binding of the hormone to insulin receptors on cells then activates a cascade of protein kinases that cause the cells to take up glucose and convert it into storage molecules such as fatty acids and glycogen. The metabolism of glycogen is controlled by activity of phosphorylase, the <b>enzyme</b> <b>that</b> breaks down glycogen, and glycogen synthase, the <b>enzyme</b> <b>that</b> makes it. These enzymes are regulated in a reciprocal fashion, with phosphorylation inhibiting glycogen synthase, but activating phosphorylase. Insulin causes glycogen synthesis by activating protein phosphatases and producing {{a decrease in the}} phosphorylation of these enzymes.|$|E
5000|$|Glycosylases (EC 3.2) are <b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> hydrolyze {{glycosyl}} compounds. [...] They are {{a type of}} hydrolase (EC 3). In turn, glycosylases {{are divided}} into two groups: glycosidases -- <b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> hydrolyze O- and S-glycosyl compounds (EC 3.2.1) -- and <b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> hydrolyze N-glycosyl compounds (EC 3.2.2).|$|R
50|$|An exoribonuclease is an {{exonuclease}} ribonuclease, {{which are}} <b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> degrade RNA by removing terminal nucleotides {{from either the}} 5' end or the 3' end of the RNA molecule. <b>Enzymes</b> <b>that</b> remove nucleotides from the 5' end are called 5'-3' exoribonucleases, and <b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> remove nucleotides from the 3' end are called 3'-5' exoribonucleases.|$|R
50|$|Different {{restriction}} <b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> {{recognize the}} same sequence {{are known as}} neoschizomers. These often cleave in different locales of the sequence. Different <b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> recognize and cleave in the same location are known as isoschizomers.|$|R
5|$|In this fashion, RNAs {{can achieve}} {{chemical}} catalysis (like enzymes). For instance, {{determination of the}} structure of the ribosome—an <b>enzyme</b> <b>that</b> catalyzes peptide bond formation—revealed that its active site is composed entirely of RNA.|$|E
5|$|The {{non-magnetic}} {{character of}} zinc and {{its lack of}} color in solution delayed discovery of its importance to biochemistry and nutrition. This changed in 1940 when carbonic anhydrase, an <b>enzyme</b> <b>that</b> scrubs carbon dioxide from blood, was shown to have zinc in its active site. The digestive enzyme carboxypeptidase became the second known zinc-containing enzyme in 1955.|$|E
5|$|VP3 {{is part of}} {{the inner}} core of the virion and is an enzyme called guanylyl transferase. This is a capping <b>enzyme</b> <b>that</b> catalyses the {{formation}} of the 5' cap in the post-transcriptional modification of mRNA. The cap stabilises viral mRNA by protecting it from nucleic acid degrading enzymes called nucleases.|$|E
50|$|The only molybdenum-containing <b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> do not feature molydopterins are the nitrogenases (<b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> fix nitrogen). These {{contain an}} iron-sulfur {{center of a}} very {{different}} type, which also usually contains molybdenum. However, if molybdenum is present, it is directly bonded to other metal atoms.|$|R
50|$|Microvilli {{function}} as the primary surface of nutrient absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. Because of this vital function, the microvillar membrane is packed with <b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> aid in the breakdown of complex nutrients into simpler compounds that are more easily absorbed. For example, <b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> digest carbohydrates called glycosidases are present at high concentrations {{on the surface of}} enterocyte microvilli. Thus, microvilli not only increase the cellular surface area for absorption, they also increase the number of digestive <b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> can be present on the cell surface.|$|R
50|$|Keratinases are {{proteolytic}} <b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> digest keratin.|$|R
5|$|A {{phosphatase}} is an <b>enzyme</b> <b>that</b> uses {{water to}} cleave a phosphoric acid monoester into a phosphate ion and an alcohol. Because a phosphatase enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of its substrate, it is a subcategory of hydrolases. Phosphatase enzymes {{are essential to}} many biological functions, because phosphorylation (e.g. by protein kinases) and dephosphorylation (by phosphatases) serve diverse roles in cellular regulation and signaling.|$|E
5|$|Allosteric {{sites are}} pockets on the enzyme, {{distinct}} from the active site, that bind to molecules in the cellular environment. These molecules then cause {{a change in the}} conformation or dynamics of the <b>enzyme</b> <b>that</b> is transduced to the active site and thus affects the reaction rate of the enzyme. In this way, allosteric interactions can either inhibit or activate enzymes. Allosteric interactions with metabolites upstream or downstream in an enzyme's metabolic pathway cause feedback regulation, altering the activity of the enzyme according to the flux {{through the rest of the}} pathway.|$|E
5|$|Although {{far less}} common than other metallo{{proteins}} (e.g. those of zinc and iron), cobaltoproteins are known aside from B12. These proteins include methionine aminopeptidase 2, an <b>enzyme</b> <b>that</b> occurs in humans and other mammals {{that does not}} use the corrin ring of B12, but binds cobalt directly. Another non-corrin cobalt enzyme is nitrile hydratase, an enzyme in bacteria that metabolize nitriles.|$|E
40|$|Redox {{reactions}} are ubiquitous and essential in nature. The <b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> catalyse these reactions enable the efficient {{flow of electrons}} within organisms as well synthesising essential biomolecules. Importantly, these <b>enzymes</b> ensure <b>that</b> the respective cellular chemical reactions occur at life-sustainable rates. Notably, many <b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> utilize such reactions for catalysis require cofactors and/or coenzymes that may include metal ions. In this thesis, redox and metal-ion biochemistry are investigated using computational methods...|$|R
40|$|The {{functionalization}} of alkanes {{was once}} thought to lie strictly within the domain of <b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> activate dioxygen in order to generate an oxidant with suitable potency to cleave inert C–H bonds. The emergence of the radical SAM superfamily of enzymes—those which use S-adenosyl-L-methionine as a precursor to a 5 ′-deoxyadenosyl 5 ′-radical—has kindled a renaissance {{in the study of}} radical-dependent enzymatic reactions, and is ushering in a wealth of new and intriguing chemistry that remains to be elucidated. This review will focus on a special subclass of radical SAM <b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> functionalize inert C–H bonds, highlighting the functional groups and the chemistry that leads to their insertion. Within this class are: (1) <b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> catalyze sulfur insertion, the prototype of which is biotin synthase; (2) <b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> catalyze P- or C-methylation, such as P-methylase or Fom 3; (3) <b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> catalyze oxygen insertion, such as the anaerobic magnesium protoporphyrin-IX oxidative cyclase (BchE); (4) and <b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> functionalize n-hexane or other alkanes as {{the first step in the}} metabolism of these inert compounds by certain bacteria. In addition to surveying reactions that have been studied at various levels of detail, this review will speculate on the mechanisms of other types of reactions that this chemistry lends itself to. The functionalization of unactivated C–H bonds is one of the more demanding tasks with whic...|$|R

5|$|An {{example of}} an <b>enzyme</b> <b>that</b> {{contains}} a cofactor is carbonic anhydrase, which {{is shown in the}} ribbon diagram above with a zinc cofactor bound as part of its active site. These tightly bound ions or molecules are usually found in the active site and are involved in catalysis. For example, flavin and heme cofactors are often involved in redox reactions.|$|E
5|$|Another {{chemical}} {{of interest}} found in P.indusiatus is hydroxymethylfurfural, which has attracted attention as a tyrosinase inhibitor. Tyrosinase catalyzes the initial steps of melanogenesis in mammals, and {{is responsible for}} the undesirable browning reactions in damaged fruits during post-harvest handling and processing, and its inhibitors are of interest to the medical, cosmetics, and food industries. Hydroxymethylfurfural, which occurs naturally in several foods, is not associated with serious health risks. P.indusiatus also contains a unique ribonuclease (an <b>enzyme</b> <b>that</b> cuts RNA into smaller components) possessing several biochemical characteristics that differentiate it from other known mushroom ribonucleases.|$|E
5|$|Antibiotic drug {{design is}} {{facilitated}} when an <b>enzyme</b> <b>that</b> {{is essential to}} the pathogen's survival is absent or very different in humans. In the example above, humans do not make peptidoglycan, therefore inhibitors of this process are selectively toxic to bacteria. Selective toxicity is also produced in antibiotics by exploiting differences {{in the structure of the}} ribosomes in bacteria, or how they make fatty acids.|$|E

5|$|Gene therapy {{typically}} {{involves the}} use of a non-infectious virus (i.e., a viral vector such as the adeno-associated virus) to shuttle genetic material into a part of the brain. The gene used leads to the production of an <b>enzyme</b> <b>that</b> helps to manage PD symptoms or protects the brain from further damage. In 2010 there were four clinical trials using gene therapy in PD. There have not been important adverse effects in these trials although the clinical usefulness of gene therapy is still unknown. One of these reported positive results in 2011, but the company filed for bankruptcy in March 2012.|$|E
5|$|Grown {{in liquid}} culture, Crucibulum laeve {{produces}} bioactive chemicals called salfredins that are structurally related to benzofuran and chromene, molecules that contain cyclic amide or lactone five-membered ring structures; these compounds {{are unique to}} this species. Salfredin B11 was first identified in 1995, while later research confirmed the presence of additional salfredin-type metabolites. These compounds are inhibitors of aldose reductase, an <b>enzyme</b> <b>that</b> has been implicated {{in the formation of}} cataracts in advanced stages of diabetes mellitus. The salfredin compounds may have therapeutic use in the treatment of this disorder.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to their function in respiration, the lungs also {{have a number of}} other functions. They are involved in maintaining homeostasis, helping in the regulation of blood pressure as part of the renin-angiotensin system. The inner lining of the blood vessels secretes angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) an <b>enzyme</b> <b>that</b> catalyses the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. The lungs are involved in the blood's acid-base homeostasis by expelling carbon dioxide when breathing.|$|E

5|$|In some {{bacteria}} and archaea, ATP synthesis {{is driven by}} the movement of sodium ions through the cell membrane, rather than the movement of protons. Archaea such as Methanococcus also contain the A1Ao synthase, a form of the <b>enzyme</b> <b>that</b> contains additional proteins with little similarity in sequence to other bacterial and eukaryotic ATP synthase subunits. It is possible that, in some species, the A1Ao form of the enzyme is a specialized sodium-driven ATP synthase, but this might not be true in all cases.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} organisms, {{increasing}} ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation due to stratospheric ozone depletion {{and other factors}} may harm the DNA of amphibians, particularly their eggs. The amount of damage depends upon the life stage, the species type and other environmental parameters. Salamanders and frogs that produce less photolyase, an <b>enzyme</b> <b>that</b> counteracts DNA damage from UVB, {{are more susceptible to}} the effects of loss of the ozone layer. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation may not kill a particular species or life stage but may cause sublethal damage.|$|E
5|$|Ornithologists James Hancock and Jim Kushlan also {{consider}} the two to be a single species, with the differences in plumage, size, skin coloration and degree of bill darkening during breeding season forming the diagnostic characters. They have proposed the populations recontacted in northwestern South America {{after a period of}} separation, and that the color difference is likely due to the presence of an <b>enzyme</b> <b>that</b> allows uptake of pigment in the diet. They have questioned whether white-plumaged birds of South America are in fact part of the ruber rather than the albus taxon, and acknowledge that more investigation is needed to determine this.|$|E
