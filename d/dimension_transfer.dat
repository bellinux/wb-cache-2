40|$|The {{quadratic}} programme {{that must}} be solved with certain output-feedback model predictive controllers can be expressed as a continuous sector-bounded nonlinearity together with two linear transformations. Thus, the multivariable circle criterion gives a simple test for stability, with or without model mismatch. In particular, it may be applied if the open-loop plant is stable and the actuators are subject to simple saturation constraints. In the case of single horizon model predictive control, it suffices to check for positive realness a transfer function matrix whose dimension corresponds {{to the number of}} inputs. For an arbitrary length receding horizon it suffices to check the poles of a low <b>dimension</b> <b>transfer</b> function matrix and the eigenvalues (over an appropriate range of operator values) of a matrix whose dimension is independent of the horizon length.

40|$|The {{problem of}} dynamic, {{infinite}} dimension, modeling of a transmission is considered. An accurate Laplace transfer function matrix {{of the system}} that consists of flexible shafts connected by gears that are either rigid or flexible is found. The first step is deriving a set of single input, infinite <b>dimension,</b> <b>transfer</b> functions for a single uniform link. The building blocks of those transfer functions are time delays, representing the wave motion, and low order rational expressions, representing the boundary phenomena. The next step is combining these individual transfer functions into an overall model of the transmission, by means of the link reaction approach that makes use of the geometric relationships and reaction moments between neighboring links. The outcome is a generalized dynamic model with the moments in the gear pairs as the generalized state vector. The explicit and highly structured form of the transfer functions allows physical insight into the system, exact calculation of natural frequencies and the construction of exact simulation schemes built from standard blocks that are available in multi-purpose simulation software...|$|E

The navigation task was broken down into component dimensions (e. g., presentation mode of the instructions, length of the instructions, characteristics of the display, size of the grids, response type). For each task dimension, one condition was used at training and the same or another condition was used at test. Each task dimension was examined in terms of two measures. One measure provided an index of transfer (i. e., better performance at test than at training when test and training involved different conditions), and the other provided an index of specificity (i. e., better performance at test when training and test conditions were the same than when training and test conditions were different). By and large, these two indices were complementary, so there was evidence of either transfer or specificity but not both. For one <b>dimension</b> <b>transfer</b> but no specificity was evident, and for another dimension specificity but no transfer was evident. For the remaining dimensions, however, there was asymmetrical transfer, with transfer evident for some conditions and specificity evident for others. The findings are interpreted within the procedural reinstatement framework.

40|$|Korpi and Palme's (1998) classic "The Paradox of Redistribution and Strategies of Equality" {{claims that}} {{universal}} social policy better reduces poverty than social policies targeted at the poor. This article revisits Korpi and Palme's classic, {{and in the}} process, explores and informs a set of enduring questions about social policy, politics, and social equality. Specifically, we investigate the relationships between three dimensions of welfare transfers - "transfer share" (the average share of household income from welfare transfers), low-income targeting, and universalism - and poverty and preferences for redistribution. We analyze rich democracies like Korpi and Palme, but also generalize to a broader sample of developed and developing countries. Consistent with Korpi and Palme, we show: a) poverty is negatively associated with the transfer share and universalism; b) redistribution preferences are negatively associated with low-income targeting; and c) universalism is positively associated with the transfer share. Contrary to Korpi and Palme, redistribution preferences {{are not related to}} transfer share or universalism; and low-income targeting is not positively associated with poverty and not negatively associated with transfer share. Therefore, instead of the "paradox of redistribution" we propose two new paradoxes of social policy: noncomplementarity and undermining. The non-complementarity paradox {{is that there is a}} mismatch between the dimensions that matter to poverty and the dimension that matters to redistribution preferences. The undermining paradox emphasizes that the <b>dimension</b> (<b>transfer</b> share) that most reduces poverty tends to increase with the one dimension (low-income targeting) that reduces support for redistribution...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this work, the {{friction}} and wear behavior of bare copper was investigated {{for the first}} time under lubricated sliding conditions in diluted ethanol solutions of butylhosphonic (C 4 P), octylphosphonic (C 8 P), dodecylphosphonic (C 12 P), and hexadecylphosphonic (C 16 P) acids. The technique aims towards a more environmentally friendly lubrication to be used in shaping of copper sheets. Bare copper samples were subjected to unidirectional sliding using a tribometer with ball-on-disk contact geometry. Copper substrates (20 mm 2 × 1 mm) were run against 100 Cr 6 Ø 10 mm ball bearing counterbodies. All tests were conducted using the same sliding conditions with a normal load of 10 N, tangential velocity of 0. 01 m/s, at room temperature of 20 °C. Worn surfaces were analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy, Optical Microscopy and White Light Interference Profilometry. When comparing to sliding tests in the pure ethanol solvent, significant decreases in terms of wear track <b>dimensions,</b> <b>transferred</b> material on the ball and friction coefficients are observed when active molecules are present in the solution. These form protective tribofilms exhibiting lubricating and anti-wear properties. Deeper studies on the tribological behavior of copper in C 4 P solution show that both low friction and low transfer of work material to the ball prevail in a specific range of low molecule concentration (5 × 10 − 4 M; 25 × 10 − 4 M). Even if the molecules are introduced during the test, after a few cycles, the tribological behavior improves, regardless of both friction level and copper surface degradation. Finally, specific friction tests were performed to further investigate the mechanisms. It was found that two mechanisms are involved; firstly molecules grafting onto the surface directly reduces friction, and secondly transformation of these grafted molecules into a tribofilm during the first mechanical contact cycles reduces it even further...|$|R

The result is a random value. Repeating the previous procedure with different random numbers we receive an representative of transfer function. It is then put on statistical test. Results from statistical test (average value, root mean square value and distribution law) are analyzed in order to determine mechanical parameters of the device. The considered example demonstrates the possibility for a easy and fast determination of mechanical dimensions and tolerances of the opto-electronic measuring devices.
