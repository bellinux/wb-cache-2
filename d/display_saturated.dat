Laboratory and clinical measurements of various functions {{and in particular}} of (letter) contrast sensitivity require accurately calibrated display contrast. In the laboratory this is achieved using expensive light meters. We developed and evaluated a novel method that uses only psychophysical responses of a person with normal vision to calibrate the luminance contrast of displays for experimental and clinical applications. Our method combines psychophysical techniques (1) for detection (and thus elimination or reduction) of <b>display</b> <b>saturating</b> non-linearities; (2) for luminance (gamma function) estimation and linearization without use of a photometer; and (3) to measure without a photometer the luminance ratios of the display’s three color channels {{that are used in}} a bit-stealing procedure to expand the luminance resolution of the display. Using a photometer we verified that the calibration achieved with this procedure is accurate for both LCD and CRT displays enabling testing of letter contrast sensitivity to 0. 5 %.

40|$|Purpose: Visually {{demanding}} {{tasks are}} performed on Smartphones. Presently most advanced smartphone displays {{vary in their}} spatial resolution, luminance, and color rendering. Users of different ages might be differently affected by these properties because of their visual abilities. The present study evaluated effect of these display properties of smartphones on user’s viewing performance, viewing discomfort, and subjective preference. Methods: Young (age 18 to 30) and old (age 40 to 65) adults were recruited to perform visual detection and reading tasks on three phones with Advance Enhanced In-Plane Switching [AH-IPS] LCD, Pentile matrix [PenTile] OLED, and Vertical strip [VStrip] OLED displays. Their viewing distance and visual performance was measured with a visual discrimination task. Their viewing distance, reading performance, and perceived discomfort was measured with continuous reading. Subjective comparisons of display properties for the tested phones were also conducted with text, photo, and video images. Results: LCD resulted in better identification on the Landolt Ring visual acuity test (with fixed target distance) and enabled longer viewing distances in the reading task compared to OLEDs. OLED displays were better in <b>displaying</b> <b>saturated</b> red and blue text, whereas LCD was better in displaying black 2 ̆ 6 white text. Subpixels arranged in vertical strips allow better visual performance and better visual appearance than in the tested PenTile structure. The older group performed more poorly on the Landolt Ring task with fixed viewing distance, but less so for LCD display with self-adjusted distance. Conclusions: The present findings demonstrate that higher resolution of LCD compared to OLED displays result in better perceived display quality and performance advantages as measured by human resolution and viewing distance. The increased resolution of the LCD apparently enabled the older group to adjust the viewing distance to attain equal performance with the younger group. These indicate the importance of improving smartphone display quality to enhance the performance for those with greater visual difficulty...|$|R

Instead of lower-level tasks performed by today’s UV teams, the sole operator would focus on high-level supervisory control tasks.

Thus some kind of decision support is needed that facilitates an operator’s ability to evaluate different action alternatives for managing a multiple UV mission schedule in real-time.

40|$|International audienceStress {{within the}} {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) induces a coordinated response, namely the unfolded protein response (UPR), devoted {{to helping the}} ER cope with the accumulation of misfolded proteins. Failure of the UPR {{plays an important role}} in several human diseases. Recent studies report that intracellular accumulation of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and cholesterol, seen in diseases of high incidence, such as obesity or atherosclerosis, results in ER stress. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of perturbations to lipid homeostasis on ER stress/UPR induction in the model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that SFA originating from either endogenous(preclusion of fatty acid desaturation) or exogenous (feeding with extracellular SFA) sources trigger ER stress and that ergosterol, the major sterol in yeast, acts synergistically with SFA in this process. This latter effect is connected to ergosterol accumulation within microsomal fractions from SFA-accumulating cells, which <b>display</b> highly <b>saturated</b> phospholipid content. Moreover, treating the cells with the molecular chaperone 4 -phenyl butyrate abolishes UPR induction, suggesting that lipid-induced ER stress leads to an overload of misfolded protein that acts, in turn, as the molecular signal for induction of the UPR. The present data are discussed in the context of human diseases that involve lipid deregulation...|$|R

Thin films were fabricated using chelated mixing route solutions spin cast onto platinized silicon substrates. Processing parameters such as: excess cation molar%, solution molality, and crystallization temperatures, for composition where x= 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, were optimized. The thin films of ~ 200 nm thickness displayed ~ 15 % and ~ 5 % change in piezoelectric properties over the composition range for d₃₃,f* and Smax, respectively. The ferroelectric properties showed a minimum at x= 10 for the coercive field and maximum at x= 5, 30 for maximum polarization. Additionally, the fatigue characteristics at x= 0, 5, 10 were studied using bipolar cycling up to 10 ⁹ cycles. A drop in d₃₃,f* and S[subscript max] is seen beginning at 10 ⁷ cycles for all compositions while polarization increased for compositions where x= 0, 5, but not for x= 10. The coercive field also increased with increasing number of cycles starting at 10 ⁵ and 10 ⁷ for compositions where x= 0, 5 and x= 10, respectively. The polarization vs electric field hysteresis loops for the fatigued samples show a transformation from saturated slim loops to unsaturated broad loops, indicative of lossy behavior, for compositions where x= 0, 5, however, hysteresis loops for the composition where x= 10 <b>displayed</b> <b>saturated</b> slim loops for 1 → 10 ⁹ cycles. The piezoelectric properties for x= 0, 5, 10 showed a 27 %, 28 %, and 34 % drop in d₃₃,f* at 10 ⁹ cycles, respectively. Here the optimal processing conditions were found for the compositions with increasing mol% of BMgT. The piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties of resulting thin films were compared for the composition range and films of selected composition were subjected to bipolar field cycling for up to 10 ⁹ cycles.

The rate of chemotaxis at different concentrations of several attractants varied for starved and growing cells. Vibrio sp. strain S 14 showed positive chemotaxis to leucine, valine, arginine, and glucose {{at the onset of}} energy and nutrient deprivation. A continued, though decreased, positive response was demonstrated fro leucine, arginine, and glucose at 10 h of starvation. Cells starved for 3 h displayed a stronger response to glucose than those starved for shorter or longer times. However, cells starved for 5 and 10 h responded more strongly to a lower concentration of glucose than did cells starved for 0 and 3 h. Starvation for 24 h elicited no measurable chemotaxis to leucine, arginine, or glucose. The motility decreased by over 95 % in the cell population after 24 h of starvation, which resulted in a low sensitivity in the chemotaxis assay. A switch in the response to valine was observed by 3 h of starvation. The addition of nutrients of 22 -h-starved cells elicited a temporary positive chemotactic response to leucine by 2 and 4 h of nutrient recovery, while cells at 1 and 6 h of recovery showed no response. At 2 h of recovery, the greatest response was recorded to 10 − 4 M leucine, whereas at 4 h it was to 10 − 2 M leucine. Ten to fifty percent of the 22 -h-starved cell population regained their motility after 4 h of nutrient-aided recovery. It is possible that two types of chemosensory systems exist in marine bacteria.

As {{one of the}} few bacterial exopolygalacturonases, it is able to remove monogalacturonate units from the nonreducing end of polygalacturonate. Detailed characterization of the enzyme showed that PelB is highly thermo-active and thermostable, with a melting temperature of 105 °C and a temperature optimum of 80 °C, the highest described to date for hydrolytic pectinases. PelB showed increasing activity on oligosaccharides with an increasing degree of polymerization. The highest activity was found on the pentamer (1000 U·mg 1).

40|$|Abstract Background Cyclopropane {{fatty acids}} (CPA) {{have been found}} in certain gymnosperms, Malvales, Litchi and other Sapindales. The {{presence}} of their unique strained ring structures confers physical and chemical properties characteristic of unsaturated fatty acids with the oxidative stability <b>displayed</b> by <b>saturated</b> fatty acids making them of considerable industrial interest. While cyclopropenoid fatty acids (CPE) are well-known inhibitors of fatty acid desaturation in animals, CPE can also inhibit the stearoyl-CoA desaturase and interfere with the maturation and reproduction of some insect species suggesting that in addition to their traditional role as storage lipids, CPE can contribute to the protection of plants from herbivory. Results Three genes encoding cyclopropane synthase homologues GhCPS 1, GhCPS 2 and GhCPS 3 were identified in cotton. Determination of gene transcript abundance revealed differences among the expression of GhCPS 1, 2 and 3 showing high, intermediate and low levels, respectively, of transcripts in roots and stems; whereas GhCPS 1 and 2 are both expressed at low levels in seeds. Analyses of fatty acid composition in different tissues indicate that the expression patterns of GhCPS 1 and 2 correlate with cyclic fatty acid (CFA) distribution. Deletion of the N-terminal oxidase domain lowered GhCPS's ability to produce cyclopropane fatty acid by approximately 70 %. GhCPS 1 and 2, but not 3 resulted in the production of cyclopropane fatty acids upon heterologous expression in yeast, tobacco BY 2 cell and Arabidopsis seed. Conclusions In cotton GhCPS 1 and 2 gene expression correlates with the total CFA content in roots, stems and seeds. That GhCPS 1 and 2 are expressed at a similar level in seed suggests both of them can be considered potential targets for gene silencing to reduce undesirable seed CPE accumulation. Because GhCPS 1 is more active in yeast than the published Sterculia CPS and shows similar activity when expressed in model plant systems, it represents a strong candidate gene for CFA accumulation via heterologous expression in production plants. </p...|$|R

In the case of rapid and recent evolutionary radiations, mitochondrial genes like cytochrome b (CYB) are often inefficient for resolving phylogenetic relationships. One {{of the best examples}} is illustrated by Arvicolinae rodents (Rodentia; Muridae), the most impressive mammalian radiation of the Northern Hemisphere which produced voles, lemmings and muskrats. Here, we compare the relative contribution of a nuclear marker-the exon 10 of the growth hormone receptor (GHR) gene-to the one of the mitochondrial CYB for inferring phylogenetic relationships among the major lineages of arvicoline rodents. Results: The analysis of GHR sequences improves the overall resolution of the Arvicolinae phylogeny. Our results show that the Caucasian long-clawed vole (Prometheomys schaposnikowi) is one of the basalmost arvicolines, and confirm that true lemmings (Lemmus) and collared lemmings (Dicrostonyx) are not closely related as suggested by morphology. Red-backed voles (Myodini) are found as the sister-group of a clade encompassing water vole (Arvicola), snow vole (Chionomys), and meadow voles (Microtus and allies). Within the latter, no support is recovered for the generic recognition of Blanfordimys, Lasiopodomys, Neodon, and Phaiomys as suggested by morphology. Comparisons of parameter estimates for branch lengths, base composition, among sites rate heterogeneity, and GTR relative substitution rates indicate that CYB sequences consistently exhibit more heterogeneity among codon positions than GHR. By analyzing the contribution of each codon position to node resolution, we show that the apparent higher efficiency of GHR is due to their third positions. Although we focus on speciation events spanning the last 10 million years (Myr), CYB sequences <b>display</b> highly <b>saturated</b> codon positions contrary to the nuclear exon.

The comparison of CYB and GHR phylogenetic efficiency supports recent assertions that nuclear genes are useful for resolving relationships of recently evolved animals.

However, {{in the case of}} soils containing rock fragments, direct measurement of unsaturated hydraulic properties remains difficult. Recently, an analytical method was proposed (Ma et al., 2009) for determining soil hydraulic properties from horizontal water absorption experiments. Here, we test if this method could be used in the determination of the hydraulic properties of stony soils with a set of experiments. The results show that the method can predict accurately and quickly the hydraulic parameters of stony soils using the cumulative infiltration volume and the rate of wetting front advancement during water absorption into a horizontal soil column. The influence of rock fragment content on some soil hydraulic properties including air entry suction, saturated hydraulic conductivity and the shape coefficients of hydraulic functions was further evaluated. Both air entry suction and shape coefficient show a large range of variation with rock fragment content. Globally, the saturated hydraulic conductivities of stony soils decreased with increasing rock fragment content. However, when the volumetric rock fragment content is about 0. 08 cm(3) cm(- 3), the stony soil <b>displayed</b> a greater <b>saturated</b> hydraulic conductivity compared to the fine earth at 95 % confidence level. The relationship between saturated hydraulic conductivity and rock fragment content is not accurately estimated by different equations relating saturated hydraulic conductivity of stony soils to that of non-stony soils.

40|$|Generative {{models of}} neuroimaging and {{electrophysiological}} data present {{new opportunities for}} accessing hidden or latent brain states. Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) uses Bayesian model inversion and selection to infer the synaptic mechanisms underlying empirically observed brain responses. DCM for electrophysiological data, in particular, aims to estimate the relative strength of synaptic transmission at different cell types and via specific neurotransmitters. Here, we report a DCM validation study concerning inference on excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, using different doses of a volatile anaesthetic agent (isoflurane) to parametrically modify excitatory and inhibitory synaptic processing while recording local field potentials (LFPs) from primary auditory cortex (A 1) and the posterior auditory field (PAF) in the auditory belt region in rodents. We test whether DCM can infer, from the LFP measurements, the expected drug-induced changes in synaptic transmission mediated via fast ionotropic receptors; i. e., excitatory (glutamatergic) AMPA and inhibitory GABA(A) receptors. Cross- and auto-spectra from the two regions were used to optimise three DCMs based on biologically plausible neural mass models and specific network architectures. Consistent with known extrinsic connectivity patterns in sensory hierarchies, we found that a model comprising forward connections from A 1 to PAF and backward connections from PAF to A 1 outperformed a model with forward connections from PAF to A 1 and backward connections from A 1 to PAF and a model with reciprocal lateral connections. The parameter estimates from the most plausible model indicated that the amplitude of fast glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) behaved as predicted by previous neurophysiological studies. Specifically, with increasing levels of anaesthesia, glutamatergic EPSPs decreased linearly, whereas fast GABAergic IPSPs <b>displayed</b> a nonlinear (<b>saturating)</b> increase.
