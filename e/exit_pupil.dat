He began observing Venus in detail in mid-1896 soon after the [...] Alvan Clark & Sons refracting telescope was installed at his new Flagstaff, Arizona observatory. Lowell observed the planet high in the daytime sky with the telescope's lens stopped down to 3 inches in diameter to reduce {{the effect of the}} turbulent daytime atmosphere. Lowell observed spoke-like surface features including a central dark spot, contrary to what was suspected then (and known now): that Venus has no surface features visible from Earth, being covered in an atmosphere that is opaque. It has been noted in a 2003 Journal for the History of Astronomy paper and in an article published in Sky and Telescope in July 2003 that Lowell's stopping down of the telescope created such a small <b>exit</b> <b>pupil</b> at the eyepiece, it may have become a giant ophthalmoscope giving Lowell an image of the shadows of blood vessels cast on the retina of his eye.|$|E
5000|$|There is a lowest usable {{magnification}} on a telescope. The {{increase in}} brightness with reduced magnification has a limit related to {{something called the}} <b>exit</b> <b>pupil.</b> The <b>exit</b> <b>pupil</b> is the cylinder of light {{coming out of the}} eyepiece, hence the lower the magnification, the larger the <b>exit</b> <b>pupil.</b> The minimum [...] can be calculated by dividing the telescope aperture [...] over the <b>exit</b> <b>pupil</b> diameter [...] Decreasing the magnification past this limit cannot increase brightness, at this limit there is no benefit for decreased magnification. Likewise calculating the <b>exit</b> <b>pupil</b> [...] is a division of the aperture diameter [...] and the visual magnification [...] used.

50|$|<b>Exit</b> <b>pupil</b> {{is defined}} as the {{diameter}} of the objective lens divided by the magnification and expressed in mm. (e.g. a 8x40 will give an <b>exit</b> <b>pupil</b> diameter of 5mm). For a given situation, the greater the <b>exit</b> <b>pupil,</b> the better the light transmission into the eye. Hence a large objective lens with a low magnification will give good light admission, especially important in deteriorating light conditions. The classic 7x50 marine binocular or monocular is ideally suited to low light conditions with its relatively large <b>exit</b> <b>pupil</b> diameter of 7.1mm and a realistic magnification which is practical on a moving boat. However, the <b>exit</b> <b>pupil</b> should be considered in relationship with the human eye pupil diameter. If the <b>exit</b> <b>pupil</b> of the chosen instrument is greater than the human eye pupil then there will be no benefit, as the eye will be the limiting factor in light admission. In effect, the extra light gathering potential is wasted. This is a consideration as one ages, because human eye pupil dilation range diminishes with age, as shown as an approximate guide in the table below.|$|E

The size and shape of this disc is crucial to the instrument's performance, because the observer's eye can see light only if it passes through this tiny aperture.

The display provides 3 D to several viewers who {{do not need to}} wear special glasses and are able to move freely over a large region.

An RBG laser source illuminates a binary phase hologram on an LCOS device that directs light to the appropriate positions on the array.

50|$|The <b>exit</b> <b>pupil</b> can be visualized by {{focusing}} the instrument on a bright, nondescript field, {{and holding a}} white card up to the eyepiece. This projects a disc of light onto the card. By moving the card closer to or further away from the eyepiece, the disc of light will be minimized when the card is at the <b>exit</b> <b>pupil,</b> and the bright disc then shows {{the diameter of the}} pupil.

50|$|The {{constancy}} of a'/a {{necessary for}} this relation to hold {{was pointed out}} by R. H. Bow (Brit. Journ. Photog., 1861), and Thomas Sutton (Photographic Notes, 1862); it has been treated by O. Lummer and by M. von Rohr (Zeit. f. Instrumentenk., 1897, 17, and 1898, 18, p. 4). It requires {{the middle of the}} aperture stop to be reproduced in the centers of the entrance and <b>exit</b> <b>pupils</b> without spherical aberration. M. von Rohr showed that for systems fulfilling neither the Airy nor the Bow-Sutton condition, the ratio a' cos w'/a tan w will be constant for one distance of the object. This combined condition is exactly fulfilled by holosymmetrical objectives reproducing with the scale 1, and by hemisymmetrical, if the scale of reproduction be equal to the ratio of the sizes of the two components.|$|R
50|$|Almost {{from the}} {{invention}} of the telescope in the 17th century the advantages of mounting two of them side by side for binocular vision seems to have been explored. Most early binoculars used Galilean optics; that is, they used a convex objective and a concave eyepiece lens. The Galilean design has the advantage of presenting an erect image but has a narrow field of view and is not capable of very high magnification. This type of construction is still used in very cheap models and in opera glasses or theater glasses. The Galilean design is also used in low magnification binocular surgical and jewelers' loupes because they can be very short and produce an upright image without extra or unusual erecting optics, reducing expense and overall weight. They also have large <b>exit</b> <b>pupils</b> making centering less critical and the narrow field of view works well in those applications. These are typically mounted on an eyeglass frame or custom-fit onto eyeglasses.|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that, in most eyes, {{astigmatism}} increases with the field angle. A simple reduced-eye model is used to demonstrate that, for point imagery in the peripheral retina, the combination of oblique astigmatism with elliptical entrance and <b>exit</b> <b>pupils</b> means that the retinal image with the optimal rotational symmetry is not necessarily at a focus corresponding to a 'best-sphere' correction. Equations are derived for the position of focus at which a circularly symmetric blur patch is obtained and for {{the dimensions of the}} patch in this and other image planes. Ray tracing through a wide-angle schematic eye is used to explore the validity of the simple model. It is shown that although the latter gives good predictions of retinal imagery for very small entrance pupils, it becomes less valid for larger, more realistic pupil diameters, due to the increasing importance of the effects of higher-order aberrations. Nevertheless, the simple model can still yield useful insights into through-focus, peripheral optical imagery...|$|R
50|$|Binoculars {{concentrate}} {{the light}} {{gathered by the}} objective into a beam, the <b>exit</b> <b>pupil,</b> whose diameter is the objective diameter divided by the magnifying power. For maximum effective light-gathering and brightest image, the <b>exit</b> <b>pupil</b> should equal {{the diameter of the}} fully dilated iris of the human eye — about 7 mm, reducing with age. If the cone of light streaming out of the binoculars is larger than the pupil it is going into, any light larger than the pupil is wasted and does not provide information to the eye. In daytime use the human pupil is typically dilated about 3 mm, which is about the <b>exit</b> <b>pupil</b> of a 7×21 binocular. Much larger 7×50 binoculars will produce a cone of light bigger than the pupil it is entering, and this light will, in the day, be wasted. It is therefore seemingly pointless to carry around a larger instrument. However, a larger <b>exit</b> <b>pupil</b> makes it easier to put the eye where it can receive the light: anywhere in the large <b>exit</b> <b>pupil</b> cone of light will do. This ease of placement helps avoid vignetting, which is a darkened or obscured view that occurs when the light path is partially blocked, and it means that the image can be quickly found which is important when looking at birds or game animals that move rapidly, or for a seaman on the deck of a pitching boat or ship. Narrow <b>exit</b> <b>pupil</b> binoculars may also be fatiguing because the instrument must be held exactly in place in front of the eyes to provide a useful image. Finally, many people use their binoculars at dusk, in overcast conditions, and at night, when their pupils are larger. Thus the daytime <b>exit</b> <b>pupil</b> is not a universally desirable standard. For comfort, ease of use, and flexibility in applications, larger binoculars with larger exit pupils are satisfying choices even if their capability is not fully used by day.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} are {{reviewed}} various designs of advanced, multi-aperture optical systems dedicated to high angular resolution imaging {{or to the}} detection of exo-planets by nulling interferometry. A simple Fourier optics formalism applicable to both imaging arrays and nulling interferometers is presented, allowing to derive their basic theoretical relationships as convolution or cross correlation products suitable for fast and accurate computation. Several unusual designs, such as a super-resolving telescope utilizing a mosaicking observation procedure or a free-flying, axially recombined interferometer are examined, and their performance in terms of imaging and nulling capacity are assessed. In all considered cases, {{it is found that}} the limiting parameter is the diameter of the individual telescopes. The entire study is only valid in the frame of first-order geometrical optics and scalar diffraction theory.

40|$|Purpose. To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} scatter on measurements of wavefront aberrations and point-spread functions in a model eye. Methods. The wavefront aberrations of a model eye were measured using Hartmann-Shack wavefront sensing and crossed-cylinder aberroscope techniques and compared with its measured point-spread function {{in the presence of}} scattering media of different concentrations. Results. The point-spread functions became broader as the concentration increased. Forward light scatter on both the light path into the eye and the light path out of the eye contributed to this broadening of the point-spread function. Neither the crossed-cylinder aberroscope nor wavefront sensing, which, respectively, measure the ocular wavefront aberrations for light entering the eye and leaving the eye, were affected by the scatter. Conclusion. We predict that by minimizing the contribution of the forward light scatter from one or other of these light paths by manipulating the size of the entrance and <b>exit</b> <b>pupils,</b> {{it should be possible to}} objectively assess narrow-angle forward light scatter in the eye by measuring and removing any confounding effect from wavefront aberration...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the multi-user autostereoscopic 3 D display system constructed {{and operated by}} the authors using the time-multiplexing approach. This prototype has three main advantages over the previous versions developed by the authors: its hardware was simplified as only one optical array is used to create viewing regions in space, a lenticular multiplexing screen is not necessary as images can be produced sequentially on a fast 120 Hz LCD with full resolution, and the holographic projector was replaced with a high-frame-rate digital micromirror device (DMD) projector. The whole system in this prototype consists of four major parts: a 120 Hz high-frame-rate DMD projector, a 49 -element optical array, a 120 Hz screen assembly, and a multi-user head tracker. The display images for the left/right eyes are produced alternatively on a 120 Hz direct-view LCD and are synchronized with {{the output of the}} projector, which acts as a backlight of the LCD. The novel steering optics controlled by the multiuser head tracker system directs the projector output to regions referred to as <b>exit</b> <b>pupils,</b> which are located in the viewers’ eyes.

This dissertation develops several methodologies to simulate ghost effects arising from an even number of light reflections between the surfaces of multi-element lens systems. We present an algorithm to generate the ghost layout that is generated by two, four and up to N (even) reflections. For each possible ghost layout, paraxial ray tracing is performed to calculate {{the locations of the}} Gaussian cardinal points, the locations and diameters of the ghost entrance and <b>exit</b> <b>pupils,</b> the locations and diameters of the ghost entrance and exit windows, and the ghost chief and marginal ray heights and angles at each surface in the ghost layout.

Potential ghosts are formed at the intersection points between the ghost image surfaces and the Gaussian nominal image plane. Paraxial radiometric methodology is developed to estimate the ghost irradiance point spread function at the nominal image plane. Contrast reduction by ghosts can cause a reduction in the depth of field, and a simulation model and experimental technique {{that can be used to}} measure the depth of field is presented.
