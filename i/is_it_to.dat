5|$|The {{sixth and}} final symphony, Sinfonia semplice, {{was written in}} 1924–25. After {{suffering}} a serious heart attack in 1925, Nielsen was forced to curtail much of his activity, although he continued to compose until his death. His sixtieth birthday in 1925 brought many congratulations, a decoration from the Swedish government, and a gala concert and reception in Copenhagen. The composer, however, was in a dour mood; {{in an article in}} Politiken on 9 November 1925 he wrote: If I could live my life again, I would chase any thoughts of Art out of my head and be apprenticed to a merchant or pursue some other useful trade the results of which could be visible in the end... What use <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> me that the whole world acknowledges me, but hurries away and leaves me alone with my wares until everything breaks down and I discover to my disgrace that I have lived as a foolish dreamer and believed that the more I worked and exerted myself in my art, the better position I would achieve. No, it is no enviable fate to be an artist.|$|E

25|$|The {{speed of}} {{rotation}} is given by the angular frequency (rad/s) or frequency (turn/s, turns per minute), or period (seconds, days, etc.). The time-rate of change of angular frequency is angular acceleration (rad/s²), This change is caused by torque. The ratio of the two (how heavy <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> start, stop, or otherwise change rotation) is given by the moment of inertia.|$|E

25|$|The four major, largely {{independent}} underpinnings {{that the}} nuclear winter concept has {{and continues to}} receive criticism over, are regarded as: firstly, would cities readily firestorm, and if so how much soot would be generated. Secondly, atmospheric longevity; would the quantities of soot assumed in the models remain in the atmosphere {{for as long as}} projected or would far more soot precipitate as black rain much sooner. Third, timing of events; how realistic <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> start the firestorms or war modelling in late spring or summer, which almost all US-Soviet winter papers assume, so as to depict the maximum possible cooling results. Lastly, the issue of darkness or opacity; how much light-blocking effect the assumed quality of the soot reaching the atmosphere would have.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of A's beliefs is no different. If A honestly believes that B {{is only slightly}} injured and so could move himself out of danger without difficulty, how fair <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> say {{that he ought to}} have foreseen? The test is what the reasonable person would have known and foreseen, given what A had done. It is the function of any court to evaluate behaviour. A defendant cannot evade responsibility through a form of wilful blindness. Fault lies not only in what a person actually believes, but also in failing to understand what the vast majority of other people would have understood. Hence, the test is hybrid, looking both at what the defendant actually knew and foresaw (i.e. subjective), and at what the reasonable person would have known (i.e. objective) and then combining the conclusions into a general evaluation of the degree of fault or blameworthiness.|$|E

500|$|Cannibal Holocaust {{is seen by}} {{some critics}} as social {{commentary}} on various aspects of modern civilization by comparing Western society {{to that of the}} cannibals. David Carter says [...] "Cannibal Holocaust is not merely focused on the societal taboo of flesh eating. The greater theme of the film is the difference between the civilized and the uncivilized. Though the graphic violence can be hard for most to stomach, the most disturbing aspect of the film is what Deodato is saying about modern society. The film asks the questions 'What <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be 'civilized'?' and 'Is it a good thing?'" [...] Mark Goodall, author of Sweet & Savage: The World Through the Shockumentary Film Lens, also contends the film's message is [...] "the rape of the natural world by the unnatural; the exploitation of 'primitive' cultures for western entertainment." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{impetus for}} what would {{become known as the}} Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration came in 1893, when in a lecture to the Royal Geographical Society Professor Sir John Murray called for a {{resumption}} of Antarctic exploration: [...] "a steady, continuous, laborious and systematic exploration of the whole southern region". He followed this call with an appeal to British patriotism: [...] "Is the last great piece of maritime exploration on the surface of our Earth to be undertaken by Britons, or <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be left to those who may be destined to succeed or supplant us on the Ocean?" [...] During the following quarter-century, fifteen expeditions from eight different nations rose to this challenge. In the patriotic spirit engendered by Murray's call, and under the influence of RGS president Sir Clements Markham, British endeavours in the following years gave particular weight to the achievement of new Farthest South records, and began to develop the character of a race for the South Pole.|$|E

Things {{have returned to}} normal, if not better than normal", which is when Punisher is introduced, who makes Matt Murdock [...] "question everything. Matt has to reevaluate [...] and what he does". Jeph Loeb, head of Marvel Television, said that [...] "if season one was really about Matt’s decision to become a hero, then season two really became about what <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be a hero." [...] By introducing the Punisher and Elektra, the writers were able to [...] "push and pull" [...] on Murdock, contrasting their three ideologies—the Punisher seeing [...] "justice in a very black-and-white kind of way", and Elektra living [...] "more in the gray". On Elektra in particular, Loeb said {{that she has a}} very clear, self-motivated agenda, and she challenges Murdock's own agenda and [...] "quest for justice. Who are you doing this for? Why are you doing this? What’s the end goal that you’re trying to achieve?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In logic an {{infinite}} regress argument is [...] "a distinctively philosophical kind of argument purporting {{to show that}} a thesis <b>is</b> defective because <b>it</b> generates {{an infinite}} series when either (formA) no such series exists or (formB) <b>were</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> exist, the thesis would lack the role (e.g.,of justification) that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> supposed <b>to</b> play." ...|$|R
