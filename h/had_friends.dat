5|$|Greenglass married Ruth Printz in 1942, {{when she}} was 18 years old. The two joined the Young Communist League shortly before Greenglass entered the U.S. Army in April 1943. They had {{a son and a}} daughter. He worked as a {{machinist}} at Fort Ord, California, and then at the Mississippi Ordnance Plant in Jackson, Mississippi. In July 1944, Greenglass was assigned to the secret Manhattan Project, the wartime project to develop the first atomic weapons. He was first stationed at the Clinton Engineer Works uranium enrichment facility at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, but was there for less than two weeks. In August 1944 he was sent to the Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico. In order to pass his security clearance, he disguised or omitted details of his communist associations, and <b>had</b> <b>friends</b> write glowing references.|$|E
5|$|As Democrats {{took control}} of the House in 1875, Randall was {{considered}} among the candidates for Speaker of the House. Many in the caucus hesitated, however, believing Randall to be too close to railroad interests and uncertain on the money question. His leadership in the Salary Grab may have harmed him, as well. Randall was also occupied by an intra-party battle with William A. Wallace for control of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party. Wallace, who had been elected to the United States Senate in 1874, was weakened by rumors that he had taken bribes from the railroads while a member of the State Senate. Randall wanted control of the Democratic machine statewide, and the Wallace faction's vulnerability on the bribery rumors provided the opportunity. In January 1875, he <b>had</b> <b>friends</b> in the state legislature begin an investigation into Wallace's clique, which ultimately turned state Democratic leaders against the senator. At the state Democratic convention in September 1875, Randall (with the help of his old ally, Squire McMullen) triumphed, putting his men in control of the state party.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{indicate}} that executive producer Steve Jobs lacked {{confidence in the}} film during its production, {{and he had been}} talking to various companies, ranging from Hallmark to Microsoft, about selling Pixar. However, as the film progressed, Jobs became ever more excited about it, feeling that he might {{be on the verge of}} transforming the movie industry. As scenes from the movie were finished, he watched them repeatedly and <b>had</b> <b>friends</b> come by his home to share his new passion. Jobs decided that the release of Toy Story that November would be the occasion to take Pixar public. A test audience near Anaheim in late July 1995 indicated the need for last-minute tweaks, which added further pressure to the already frenetic final weeks. Response cards from the audience were encouraging, but were not top of the scale, adding further question as to how audiences would respond. The film ended with a shot of Andy's house and the sound of a new puppy. Michael Eisner, who attended the screening, told Lasseter afterward that the film needed to end with a shot of Woody and Buzz together, reacting to the news of the puppy.|$|E

5|$|With Jongintaba's backing, in 1939 Mandela {{began work}} on a BA degree at the University of Fort Hare, an elite black {{institution}} in Alice, Eastern Cape, with around 150 students. There he studied English, anthropology, politics, native administration, and Roman Dutch law in his first year, desiring to become an interpreter or clerk in the Native Affairs Department. Mandela stayed in the Wesley House dormitory, befriending his own kinsman, K. D. Matanzima, as well as Oliver Tambo, who became a close friend and comrade for decades to come. He took up ballroom dancing, performed in a drama society play about Abraham Lincoln, and gave Bible classes in the local community {{as part of the}} Student Christian Association. Although he <b>had</b> <b>friends</b> connected to the African National Congress (ANC) who wanted South Africa to be independent of the British Empire, Mandela avoided any involvement with the anti-imperialist movement, and became a vocal supporter of the British war effort when the Second World War broke out. He helped to found a first-year students' house committee which challenged the dominance of the second-years, {{and at the end of}} his first year became involved in a Students' Representative Council (SRC) boycott against the quality of food, for which he was suspended from the university; he never returned to complete his degree.|$|E

25|$|While a few {{writers and}} {{researchers}} {{have tried to}} assign such a retrospective diagnosis to Turing, {{and it is true}} that he had his share of eccentricities, the Asperger's-like traits portrayed in the film – social awkwardness, difficulty working cooperatively with others, and tendency to take things too literally – bear little relationship to the actual adult Turing, who, despite enjoying working alone, was sociable and <b>had</b> <b>friends,</b> was also viewed as having a sense of humour, and had good working relationships with colleagues.|$|E

25|$|King Drest may {{not have}} had a secure hold on power. One Simul son of Drest, perhaps yet another sibling of Nechtan, was imprisoned by Drest in 725. In the same year, Brec of Fortriu died. He is assumed from the context to be the bishop of Fortriu, almost {{certainly}} appointed by Nechtan and the earliest known bishop in Pictland. In 726, Drest had Nechtan imprisoned. This may have involved no more than removing the former king from one monastery, where he <b>had</b> <b>friends</b> and influence, to another where Drest's partisans were in control.|$|E

He spent time living in San Francisco. Since then, he has worked, on and off, as a session musician and studio engineer. In the late 1980s, while living in Olympia, near Seattle, he worked with many indie label artists.

25|$|The county {{magistrate}} supervised {{units of}} control below the county level. These included village elders, local institutions, and self-rule organizations, especially the township (xiang), {{which had been}} made formal under the Han dynasty, and the baojia system, a system of mutual responsibility formally organized by Wang Anshi in the 11th century, during the Song dynasty. Under Mongol rule in the Yuan dynasty, the county magistrates were all Mongol, though their subordinates were Han Chinese. In the Ming and Qing dynasties {{the growth of the}} economy and increase in population led magistrates to hire administrative secretaries and to rely on local elite families, or scholar-gentry.These local elites <b>had</b> <b>friends</b> whose influence could counteract the magistrate if he displeased them.|$|E

25|$|Dolphy {{was born}} in Los Angeles to Eric Allan Dolphy, Sr. and Sadie Dolphy, who immigrated to the United States from Panama. He picked up the {{clarinet}} {{at the age of}} six, and {{in less than a month}} was playing in the school's orchestra. He also learned the oboe in junior high school, though he never recorded on the instrument. Hearing Fats Waller, Duke Ellington and Coleman Hawkins led him toward jazz, and he picked up the saxophone and flute while in high school. His father built a studio for Eric in their backyard, and Eric often <b>had</b> <b>friends</b> come by to jam; recordings with Clifford Brown from this studio document this early time.|$|E
25|$|The SLA {{believed}} that its future depended on {{its ability to}} acquire new members and realized that, because of the killing of Marcus Foster, few if any people in the Bay Area underground wished to join them. Cinque suggested moving the organization to his former neighborhood in Los Angeles, where he <b>had</b> <b>friends</b> whom they might recruit. However, they relocated in a sloppy manner and had much difficulty in becoming established on their new turf. The SLA relied on commandeering housing and supplies in Los Angeles, and thus alienated the people who were ensuring their secrecy and protection. At this stage, the imprisoned SLA member Russell Little said that he believed the SLA had entirely lost sight of its goals and had entered into a confrontation with the police rather than a political dialogue with the public.|$|E
25|$|In a {{study done}} by social {{psychologist}} Shawn Burn, {{it was found that}} personal contact with individuals within a neighborhood is {{the most effective way to}} increase recycling within a community. In his study, he had 10 block leaders talk to their neighbors and persuade them to recycle. A comparison group was sent fliers promoting recycling. It was found that the neighbors that were personally contacted by their block leaders recycled much more than the group without personal contact. As a result of this study, Shawn Burn believes that personal contact within a small group of people is an important factor in encouraging recycling. Another study done by Stuart Oskamp examines the effect of neighbors and friends on recycling. It was found in his studies that people who <b>had</b> <b>friends</b> and neighbors that recycled were much more likely to also recycle than those who didn't have friends and neighbors that recycled.|$|E

25|$|As a child, Berdella was intelligent, but {{a classic}} loner who rarely played outside his own home, and seldom <b>had</b> <b>friends</b> visit his home to socialize with him. He was also {{severely}} nearsighted (resulting in his {{being required to}} wear thick glasses {{from the age of}} five) and afflicted with a slight speech impediment. Furthermore, as a child, he would be diagnosed as suffering from a high blood pressure, for which he was prescribed several medications. In part because of this diagnosis, Berdella was largely unathletic, whereas his younger brother, Daniel (b. 1956), displayed an aptitude for various sports from an early age. As Berdella's father valued sports and physical education, he viewed his older son's lack of interest in sports as a sign of failure on Berdella's part, and would often compare him unfavorably with his younger brother. Occasionally, Berdella's father would also become physically and emotionally abusive against his children, and is known to have beaten them with a leather strap.|$|E
25|$|Seward {{remained}} resolutely single {{throughout her}} life, despite many offers, and friendships, and was quite outspoken about {{the institution of}} marriage, not unlike her heroine in Louisa, a position that would later be echoed in the novels of her step-niece, Maria Edgeworth. She shunned both marriage and sexual love, as inferior to Aristotelian friendship, based more on equality and virtue. However she <b>had</b> <b>friends</b> of both genders, although only seeking romantic relationships with women. In 1985 Lillian Faderman suggested that her orientation was lesbian, although there is little known evidence of either the erotic or sexual, in her relationships, though the term relates more to twentieth rather than eighteenth century concepts of identity. However, since 1985 Seward remains within the lesbian poetic canon. However Teresa Barnard argues against this based more on examination of her correspondence than merely her poetry, while more recently Barrett has argued for it, based on other sources.|$|E
25|$|The Jean Monnet House {{is located}} in Houjarray, Yvelines, 80 {{kilometers}} (50 miles) outside of Paris. This old farm became Jean Monnet’s property in 1945, upon his return to France. It is even here that Jean Monnet and his advisors, {{in the last days}} of April 1950, drew up the historic declaration that Robert Schuman used to address Europe on 9 May 1950, proposing the creation of the CECA (European Coal and Steel Community) as well as creating the basis of the European Community. In his office, Robert Schuman, Walter Hallstein, Paul-Henri Spaak, Konrad Adenauer, René Pleven, Helmut Schmidt, and many others exchanged their views with Jean Monnet on our common future. On Sundays, he <b>had</b> <b>friends</b> passing by come to his house; among them were Dwight Eisenhower, George Ball, and Edward Heath. He liked fireside conversations with famous journalists such as Walter Lippman, Hubert Beuve-Méry, or his neighbor Pierre Viansson-Ponté. This house was also where Jean Monnet died on 16 March 1979. In 1982, even though the house had deteriorated {{because of a lack of}} upkeep, the European Parliament considered Monnet’s home to be a symbolic place loaded with memories, thus being common heritage for Europeans. The Parliament acquired it and entrusted its reconstitution, management, and organization to the Jean Monnet Association. Since 2000, a multimedia conference room has welcomed bigger groups of visitors. The Jean Monnet Association team organizes about 250 conferences on European history and current events each year.|$|E
