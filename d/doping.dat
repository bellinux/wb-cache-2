5|$|Over time, the results, and image, of the Games were {{particularly}} badly affected by retrospective <b>doping</b> positives. Following a Russian <b>doping</b> scandal in 2016, a large re-examination of samples took place, leading to {{significant numbers of}} disqualifications, particularly in Athletics and Weightlifting. On April 2017 after near 9 years, the Olympics has had the most (50) Olympic medals stripped for <b>doping</b> violations of any Games.|$|E
5|$|About 1,400 random <b>doping</b> {{tests were}} carried out during the Games. Two athletes tested {{positive}}; judoka Shokir Muminov on November 19, 2010 and Greco-Roman wrestler Jakhongir Muminov on November 24, 2010, both from Uzbekistan, tested positive for methylhexanamine. On January 24, 2011, the OCA announced another two <b>doping</b> failures, Qatari's Ahmed Dheeb who tested positive for exogenous testosterone metabolites and Palestinian Awajna Abdalnasser who tested positive for 19-Norandrosterone.|$|E
5|$|<b>Doping</b> {{has played}} a {{significant}} part in the modern history of track and field. State-sponsored <b>doping</b> in East Germany with hormones and anabolic steroids marked the rise of women from the German Democratic Republic {{in track and field}} from the late 1960s to the 1980s. A number of these women, such as Marita Koch, broke world records and were highly successful at international competitions. Some athletes, who were following a <b>doping</b> plan from their teenage years, suffered significant health problems {{as a result of the}} regime. Ben Johnson ran a new world record in the 100metres at the 1988 Seoul Olympics but was later banned for using anabolic steroids. In the mid-first decade of the 21st century, the BALCO Scandal eventually resulted in the downfall of prominent sprinters such as Marion Jones and Tim Montgomery, among others, through their usage of banned substances. <b>Doping</b> problems have also been associated with sprinters such as Tyson Gay, Michael Rogers, and Justin Gatlin, all from the United States. <b>Doping</b> has also affected entire nations, such as Russia, which has been banned from competing at both the Indoor World Championships and the Olympics in 2016. This ban was imposed in 2016 after major allegations of <b>doping</b> and covering up were discovered in 2015.|$|E

5|$|East Germany was {{particularly}} {{successful in the}} 1970s and 1980s, when they dominated the women's events, aided by systematic state-sponsored <b>doping.</b> Their women swept the award for the first ten years of its existence from 1980 to 1989, with Kristin Otto winning three times, before the Berlin Wall and communism fell. With {{the end of the}} state-sponsored <b>doping</b> program, the (East) German stranglehold on women's swimming was broken. In the two decades since reunification, the female award was won by Germans four times, three by Franziska van Almsick. During the 1980s, Michael Gross of West Germany, nicknamed The Albatross in reference to his vast wingspan, dominated European swimming, winning five consecutive awards from 1982 to 1986. Swimming World has vacated all awards previously awarded to East German swimmers because of the government-sanctioned systematic <b>doping.</b>|$|E

Had his tainted Tour victories been reallocated (as were the victories of Floyd Landis and Contador) to the second placed rider in each race, Jan Ullrich would have joined the list with 4 Tour wins. However, the race organisers ASO have decided not to reallocate the titles won in those years, in recognition of the historic <b>doping</b> problem in the sport at that time - Ullrich himself having been banned for a <b>doping</b> violation.

5|$|Most ZnO has n-type character, even in {{the absence}} of {{intentional}} <b>doping.</b> Nonstoichiometry is typically the origin of n-type character, but the subject remains controversial. An alternative explanation has been proposed, based on theoretical calculations, that unintentional substitutional hydrogen impurities are responsible. Controllable n-type <b>doping</b> is easily achieved by substituting Zn with group-III elements such as Al, Ga, In or by substituting oxygen with group-VII elements chlorine or iodine.|$|E

Then the optimized value of Vc-Voff and breakdown voltages corresponding to maximum value of transconductance has been obtained. These values are then used to predict the transconductance and cut-off frequency of the device for different channel depths and gate lengths.
