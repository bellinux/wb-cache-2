25|$|In general, a {{capacitor}} {{is seen as}} a storage component for electric energy. But this is only one capacitor function. A capacitor can also act as an AC resistor. In many cases the capacitor is used as a decoupling capacitor to filter or bypass undesired biased AC frequencies to the ground. Other applications use capacitors for capacitive coupling of AC signals; the dielectric is used only for blocking DC. For such applications the AC resistance <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> capacitance value.|$|E

2500|$|Tantalum {{electrolytic}} capacitors, as well {{as other}} conventional capacitors, have two electrical functions. For timers or similar applications, capacitors are seen as a storage component to store electrical energy. But for smoothing, bypassing, or decoupling applications like in power supplies, the capacitors work additionally as AC resistors to filter undesired AC components from voltage rails. For this (biased) AC function the frequency dependent AC resistance (impedance [...] "Z") <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> capacitance value.|$|E

2500|$|Writing for The American Spectator, Jeremy Lott commented {{positively}} {{about the}} protest movement: [...] "While the suits at Comedy Central and Yale University Press have been cowed, {{people across the}} country have decided to speak up and thereby magnify the offense a thousandfold." [...] Helge Rønning, a professor at the Institute of Media and Communication at the University of Oslo, said the offense to Muslims was outweighed by freedom-of-speech concerns. [...] "Indignation from those who claim the right to engage in criticism of religion <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> indignation that comes from the Muslim side," [...] he told the [...] NRK (Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation). [...] "I think that this is an attitude that goes deeper than whether these drawings are blasphemous or not." [...] Vebjørn Selbekk, a Norwegian editor who was threatened in 2006 after he reprinted Danish cartoons of Mohammed in his publication, supported the May 20 protest. [...] "I think maybe this is the right way to react—with humor, and also to spread this number, so it isn't only a few who sit with all the threats and all the discomfort associated with defending our freedom of speech in this area," [...] he said. In an analysis of the protest movement and surrounding controversy, staff writer Liliana Segura of AlterNet noted, [...] "In a democratic society where free speech is vigilantly protected, it is perfectly reasonable to call out censorship, particularly when it springs from some form of tyrannical religious extremism." ...|$|E
2500|$|Paul Sexton of The Times, who {{reviewed}} the opening {{concert at the}} Ahoy Rotterdam in Rotterdam, Netherlands, compared her two-hour performance to that of Broadway theatre, calling it [...] "an audiovisual banquet." [...] According to the Birmingham Post the concert at the NEC Arena was an [...] "accomplishment." [...] As the show began [...] "after the impatient fans had worked themselves into a frenzy, Janet finally arrived amid a barrage of space-age pyro-technics. Of course, at an event such as this, the overall spectacle <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> music itself. In true Jackson tradition, the costumes and choreography in this show made for theatre of the highest order." [...] Her vocal performance was complimented, as Let's Wait Awhile and [...] "Again" [...] "both showcased Janet's ability to belt out heartfelt, if slightly soppy ballads." [...] Richard Harrington of The Washington Post commented [...] "Jackson looked fabulous, danced fabulous, sang as close to fabulous as she ever has {{and in the end}} provided a fabulous two hours of entertainment that was equal parts rock concert, Las Vegas revue and Broadway musical." [...] Steve Jones of USA Today remarked, [...] "Janet Jackson had a sellout crowd for the kickoff of her first U.S. tour in four years, and she blew the fans away with imaginative staging and sheer exuberance." [...] J.D. Considine The Sun noted [...] "on albums, Jackson's sound isn't defined by her voice so much as by the way her voice is framed by the lush, propulsive production of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. No surprise, then, that her concert took a similar approach, treating Jackson's voice as just one component in the overall spectacle... But even though Jackson showed strength from time to time—her singing on [...] "Black Cat" [...] was commanding enough to hold its own against the wailing electric guitar." ...|$|E

6000|$|... (M119) For {{forty years}} this {{question}} had been fought. The ballot actually figured in a clause {{of an early}} draft of the Reform bill of 1832. Grote, inspired by James Mill whose vigorous pleas for the ballot in his well-known article in 1830 were the high landmark in the controversy, brought it before parliament in an annual motion. When that admirable man quitted parliament to finish his great history of Greece, the torch was still borne onwards by other hands. Ballot {{was one of the}} five points of the charter. At nearly every meeting for parliamentary reform between the Crimean war and Disraeli’s bill of 1867, the ballot was made a cardinal point. General opinion fluctuated from time to time, and in the sixties journals of repute formally dismissed it as a dead political idea. The extension of the franchise in 1867 brought it to life again, and Mr. Bright led the van in the election of 1868 by declaring in his address that he regarded the ballot as of the first importance. “Whether I look,” he said, “to the excessive cost of elections, or to the tumult which so often attends them, or to the unjust and cruel pressure which is so frequently brought to bear upon the less independent class of voters, I am persuaded that the true interest of the public and of freedom will be served by the system of secret and free voting.” J. S. Mill had argued that the voter should name his candidate in the polling booth, just as the judge does his duty in a court open to the public eye. No, replied Bright, the jury-room <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> judge’s bench, and yet the jury-room is treated as secret, and in some countries the verdict is formally given by ballot. Some scandals in the way of electoral intimidation did much to ripen public opinion. One parliamentary committee in 1868 brought evidence of this sort to light, and another committee recommended secret voting as the cure.|$|E
