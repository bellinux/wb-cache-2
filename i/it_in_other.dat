25|$|The Habsburg Empire was a {{conglomerate}} {{of different}} states and people. In this conglomerate, the Roman Catholic religion served {{to strengthen the}} other forces of cohesion, dynastic, absolutism, bureaucratic, or military, and provided a political instrument for domination and unification. In addition to various measures designed to protect Catholicism, {{which at the time}} was very weak in Transylvania (predominantly Romanian Orthodox), the Habsburgs tried to strengthen <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> ways. The fact that the Romanian people, due to their Orthodox religion, were only tolerated in Transylvania presented an excellent opportunity, and the Habsburgs believed that by winning over the Romanians they would strengthen their position in the region.|$|E
25|$|The engine {{has much}} in common with modern ones. It has two cylinders, a carburetor, a {{familiar}} arrangement of valves and cams. However, unlike modern engines, and unlike the earlier 1807 François Isaac de Rivaz engine, the explosion did not directly provide power. Instead, the explosion expelled air from the cylinder through a one-way valve. The cylinder was cooled by a water jacket and water injected into the combustion chamber after it fired. The cooling gasses caused a vacuum and atmospheric pressure drove the piston. Morey did mention trying direct action, and elaborated on <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> descriptions. However, his method was more complicated and possibly less efficient because it used more of the engine’s stroke to draw in fuel.|$|E

Supported currencies include Australian Dollar (AUD), Canadian Dollar (CAD), Euro (EUR), Pound Sterling (GBP), Hong Kong Dollar (HKD), Japanese Yen (JPY), New Zealand Dollar (NZD), Singapore Dollar (SGD), Thai Baht (THB), US Dollar (USD) and South African Rand (ZAR).

25|$|In November 2009, The Economist {{estimated}} that taxing employer-provided health insurance (which is presently exempt from tax) would add $215 {{billion per year}} to federal tax revenue during the 2013–2014 periods. Peter Singer wrote in the New York Times that the current exclusion of insurance premiums from compensation represents a $200 billion subsidy for the private insurance industry {{and that it would}} likely not exist without <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> <b>other</b> words, taxpayers might be more inclined to change behavior or the system itself if they were paying $200 billion more in taxes each year related to health insurance. To put this amount in perspective, the federal government collected $1,146 billion in income taxes in 2008, so $200 billion represents a 17.5% increase in the effective tax rate.|$|E
25|$|Within Iraq, Annandale {{collected}} his specimens from a sandy lake-bed deposit, in {{the vicinity}} of Nasiriyah on the Euphrates. Eames and Wilkins found the species in borings made in the Hammar Marshes, and Plaziat and Younis found <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> localities of the Hammar Formation; they described it as a typical species of this formation. The deposits in Iraq where the species has been found are in brackish habitat (although Annandale believed the deposits to be freshwater, this was due to reworking), toward the outer edge of tidal influence in the Euphrates and Tigris. Much of the species' former habitat, as evidenced by subfossil remains, is now less brackish than it was when the fossils were deposited, meaning it is less likely to be extant in such places.|$|E

25|$|Newton's theory {{could be}} used to predict the {{reflection}} of light, but could only explain refraction by incorrectly assuming that light accelerated upon entering a denser medium because the gravitational pull was greater. Newton published the final version of his theory in his Opticks of 1704. His reputation helped the particle theory of light to hold sway during the 18th century. The particle theory of light led Laplace to argue that a body could be so massive that light could not escape from <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> <b>other</b> words, it would become what is now called a black hole. Laplace withdrew his suggestion later, after a wave theory of light became firmly established as the model for light (as has been explained, neither a particle or wave theory is fully correct). A translation of Newton's essay on light appears in The large scale structure of space-time, by Stephen Hawking and George F. R. Ellis.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s, Interstate 15 (I-15) was {{constructed}} next to Tower Rock. The general route of I-15 {{was established by}} 1957 (a year after passage of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 which established funding for the interstate highway system), but there were 11 specific alternative routes available. These were narrowed down to just three, with the chosen route following the route of Highway 91 through the Missouri Canyon and past Tower Rock. This route provided both lower construction and maintenance costs, and had {{the added benefit of}} allowing Highway 91 to act as a frontage road. State planners also chose to build a four-lane rather than two-lane interstate, arguing that it was less expensive to build a four-lane road now than to widen the route in the future.

25|$|As the ovules {{develop into}} seeds, the ovary begins to ripen and the ovary wall, the pericarp, may become fleshy (as in berries or drupes), or form a hard outer {{covering}} (as in nuts). In some multiseeded fruits, {{the extent to}} which the flesh develops is proportional to the number of fertilized ovules. The pericarp is often differentiated into two or three distinct layers called the exocarp (outer layer, also called epicarp), mesocarp (middle layer), and endocarp (inner layer). In some fruits, especially simple fruits derived from an inferior ovary, other parts of the flower (such as the floral tube, including the petals, sepals, and stamens), fuse with the ovary and ripen with <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> <b>other</b> cases, the sepals, petals and/or stamens and style of the flower fall off. When such other floral parts are a significant part of the fruit, it is called an accessory fruit. Since other parts of the flower may contribute to the structure of the fruit, it is important to study flower structure to understand how a particular fruit forms.|$|E
