50|$|Small fish, arthropods, and {{crustaceans}} make up {{the diet}} of young Cuban crocodiles. Adults of the species feed mostly upon small mammals, fish, and turtles. They have blunt rear teeth, which aid in crushing the shells of their turtle prey. Cuban crocodiles also demonstrate the <b>jumping</b> <b>feeding</b> technique seen in other crocodilians such as the American alligator. By thrusting with their powerful tails, they can leap from the water and snatch small animals from overhanging branches. The Cuban crocodile, while not a particularly large species, is often regarded as the most aggressive New World crocodile and is behaviorally dominant over the larger American crocodile {{in areas where the}} two species coexist. Data regarding attacks on humans are limited, but occurrences are likely rare given the species' very small distribution area and separation from human populations. However, captive specimens show aggression towards their keepers, a behavior displayed at Gatorland.|$|R
50|$|Portia is a genus of <b>jumping</b> spider that <b>feeds</b> {{on other}} spiders (araneophagic). They are {{remarkable}} for their intelligent hunting behaviour, {{which suggests that}} {{they are capable of}} learning and problem solving, traits normally attributed to much larger animals.|$|R
60|$|I {{soon found}} that I had {{undertaken}} what was no easy task, for he required feeding {{so early in}} a morning that I was obliged to take him and his bread crumbs into my bedroom, and <b>jump</b> up to <b>feed</b> {{him as soon as}} he began to chirp, which he did in very good time.|$|R
40|$|In nature, many organisms {{alter their}} {{developmental}} trajectory {{in response to}} environmental variation. However, studies of thermal acclimation have historically involved stable, unrealistic thermal treatments. In our study, we incorporated ecologically relevant treatments {{to examine the effects}} of environmental stochasticity on the thermal acclimation of the fall field cricket (Gryllus pennsylvanicus). We raised crickets for 5 weeks at either a constant temperature (25 °C) or at one of three thermal regimes mimicking a seasonal decline in temperature (from 25 to 12 °C). The latter three treatments differed in their level of thermal stochasticity: crickets experienced either no diel cycle, a predictable diel cycle, or an unpredictable diel cycle. Following these treatments, we measured several traits considered relevant to survival or reproduction, including growth rate, <b>jumping</b> velocity, <b>feeding</b> rate, metabolic rate, and cold tolerance. Contrary to our predictions, the acclimatory responses of crickets were unrelated to the magnitude or type of thermal variation. Furthermore, acclimation of performance was not ubiquitous among traits. We recommend additional studies of acclimation in fluctuating environments to assess the generality of these findings...|$|R
40|$|The {{behavior}} of affine processes, which are ubiquitous {{in a wide}} range of applications, depends crucially on the choice of state space. We study the case where the state space is compact, and prove in particular that (i) no diffusion is possible; (ii) jumps are possible and enforce a grid-like structure of the state space; (iii) <b>jump</b> components can <b>feed</b> into drift components, but not vice versa. Using our main structural theorem, we classify all bivariate affine processes with compact state space. Unlike the classical case, the characteristic function of an affine process with compact state space may vanish, even in very simple cases...|$|R
30|$|This study {{addressed}} the nutritional and {{economic benefits of}} using a multi-stage LP optimization model in broiler feed formulation. The model provides information to feed producers and traders to determine potential switch points between commodities based on the price spread level. There are two primary limitations of the approach presented in this paper. First, the constraints are linear, thereby forcing corner solutions and discrete <b>jumps</b> between <b>feed</b> inputs. This may, however, be a realistic interpretation {{of the behavior of}} firms when considering contracting and transportation costs. Second, this model only examines the cost of inputs in feed mix and dietary requirements, while profit-maximizing behavior likely includes additional objectives and constraints. However, by examining the dietary feed commodity switch between months, we demonstrate variations in feeding strategies and opportunities to minimize feed cost—of primary significance in the livestock production profit function—over a given time period. Our model is built on an open source environment and can be broadly implemented by decision-makers to explore and test further modeling scenarios which suit the production objectives. Furthermore, if feed price forecasts are available, the model can also be automated to predict the least cost dietary dynamics and price spread.|$|R
40|$|Two haplotypes of Xylella fastidiosa subsp. pauca (Xfp) that {{correlated}} with their host of origin {{were identified in}} a collection of 90 isolates infecting citrus and coffee plants in Brazil, based on a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the gyrB sequence. A new single-nucleotide primer extension (SNuPE) protocol was designed for rapid identification of Xfp according to the host source. The protocol proved to be robust for the prediction of the Xfp host source in blind tests using DNA from cultures of the bacterium, infected plants, and insect vectors allowed to feed on Xfp- infected citrus plants. AMOVA and STRUCTURE analyses of microsatellite data separated most Xfp populations {{on the basis of their}} host source, indicating that they were genetically distinct. The combined use of the SNaPshot protocol and three previously developed multilocus SSR markers showed that two haplotypes and distinct isolates of Xfp infect citrus and coffee in Brazil and that multiple, genetically different isolates can be present in a single orchard or infect a single tree. This combined approach will be very useful in studies of the epidemiology of Xfp- induced diseases, host specificity of bacterial genotypes, the occurrence of Xfp host <b>jumping,</b> vector <b>feeding</b> habits, etc., in economically important cultivated plants or weed host reservoirs of Xfp in Brazil and elsewhere [Int Microbiol 2015; 18 (1) : 13 - 24].

5000|$|Changing the {{environment}} from desert to grassland extends fertile land into herbivore habitat. Marsupials that once scavenged the dry deserts for scarce grasses and sparse leafy shrubs now find {{an abundance of}} vegetation, particularly in areas being farmed. With this large amount of resources now available, marsupials, {{have been able to}} reproduce more than ever before. Most cattle are free range, yet a few are fenced in by a three line barbed wire fence that red kangaroos have no problem <b>jumping</b> over to <b>feed</b> on irrigated grasses. [...] Farmers also erect agricultural settlements near rivers or flood-outs. Although farms may be in the desert, these oases can provide the water for an entire crop or herd if managed correctly. Marsupials use these creeks and flood-outs as natural habitats; however, once farmers irrigate these bodies of water, their habitats are extended. Instead of feeding on dry grass with low nourishment, kangaroos and other marsupials seek the plush grasses growing off irrigated moist soil. As farmers continue to use these methods, the marsupial population will continue to increase.|$|R
40|$|Aproceros leucopoda, the zig-zag sawfly, an {{invasive}} pest of elms (Ulmus spp.), {{was found}} in two separate areas of Germany through July 2014, i. e., a northern area including the states of Berlin, Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt, and a southern area in Bavaria. A speed of self-dispersal of 45 – 90 km/yr has been calculated from earlier and present records. Observations of A. leucopoda in Belgium and the Netherlands during 2013, which are 360 – 610 km distant from records in Germany of that year, are interpreted as resulting from human-mediated <b>jump</b> dispersal. Larvae, <b>feeding</b> traces and cocoons were frequently found on the native elm species U. minor and U. glabra, whereas none could be detected on U. laevis. Other occurrences were often on Resista® elms, causing severe defoliation in a recent planting. New host plant records for A. leucopoda are: U. minor ‘Webbiana’, U. minor var. suberosa, and the Resista® cultivars U. ‘New Horizon’, U. ‘Regal’ and U. ‘Rebona’. The future dispersal of A. leucopoda throughout most of Germany is expected, because at least U. glabra and U. minor are widespread in this country...|$|R
40|$|Copepod nauplii {{are either}} ambush feeders that feed on motile prey or they produce a feeding current that entrains prey cells. It {{is unclear how}} ambush and feeding-current feeding nauplii {{perceive}} and capture prey. Attack <b>jumps</b> in ambush <b>feeding</b> nauplii should not be feasible at low Reynolds numbers due to the thick viscous boundary layer surrounding the attacking nauplius. We use high-speed video to describe the detection and capture of phytoplankton prey by the nauplii of two ambush feeding species (Acartia tonsa and Oithona davisae) and by the nauplii of one feeding-current feeding species (Temora longicornis). We demonstrate that the ambush feeders both detect motile prey remotely. Prey detection elicits an attack jump, but the jump is not directly towards the prey, such as has been described for adult copepods. Rather, the nauplius jumps past the prey and sets up an intermittent feeding current that pulls in the prey from behind towards the mouth. The feeding-current feeding nauplius detects prey arriving in the feeding current but only when the prey is intercepted by the setae on the feeding appendages. This elicits an altered motion pattern of the feeding appendages that draws in the prey...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this report is to combine, in one document, previously reportedinformation on factors influencing fish passage through culverts, especially as it pertains toconditions indicative of Montana. First, the need for considering fish passage is discussed,followed by an investigation of biological, hydrologic and hydraulic criteria influencing fishpassage. An integration of biological and hydraulic criteria is presented, as is a review ofprevious studies conducted in Montana. Recommendations for future research are alsopresented. The major biological criteria influencing fish passage are species and size of fish, <b>jumping</b> ability,and seasonal <b>feeding</b> and spawning migrations as related to the hydrologic regime of the streamrequiring a culvert crossing. In general, salmonid species and healthy adult fish are the strongestswimming and spawning is the major reason fish migrate. The main culvert features preventing fish passage include; a perched outlet, too great a velocity, too shallow a depth or too long adistance between resting pools. The major hydraulic criteria influencing fish passage are: flow rates during fish migration periods;and type, roughness, length and slope of the culvert. In general, the optimum design for peakflow conveyance, a smooth pipe flowing full, will not meet fish passage criteria at any discharge. Fish size appears to have little influence on ability to negotiate a culvert despite its effects onswimming performance. One theory is that smaller fish utilize regions of low velocity near theculvert wall. Multiple possibilities for future research to better characterize fish passage are listed. Examplesinclude better characterization of velocity gradients within culverts and evaluation of fishswimming performance for poorly characterized Montana species...|$|R
