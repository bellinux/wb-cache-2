5000|$|Youth held low {{positions}} in the hierarchy and engaged in relatively low volumes of activity for short periods of time. The police are capturing the front-line players of the drug industry rather than the donos. 51% of youth involved with trafficking reported it to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>easy</b> to obtain a gun. [...] While 58% involved in trafficking, reported it to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>easy</b> to obtain cocaine.|$|R
25|$|RTV {{silicone}} (room temperature vulcanization silicone) is {{used primarily}} as a molding material as it <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>easy</b> to use but is relatively expensive. Few other materials stick to it, making molds easy to separate.|$|E
25|$|The filter {{itself can}} be {{internal}} or external. In its simplest DIY internal version an FBF <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>easy</b> to build, with a container, sand, pump, and some plumbing. There are many variables: shape {{and size of the}} container, quantity of sand or equivalent, particle sizes, the pump's power, and plumbing.|$|E
25|$|A funnel gag {{consists}} of a funnel with a tube leading from its spout into the mouth, usually with straps to hold the tube in. Such a gag is used to force the bound person to drink a fluid. It <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>easy</b> to choke during such forced drinking. People involved with watersports may also find interest in this gag.|$|E

25|$|The Augustan era is {{difficult}} to define chronologically in prose and poetry, but it <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>easy</b> to date its end in drama. The Augustan era's drama ended definitively in 1737, with the Licensing Act. Prior to 1737, however, the English stage was changing rapidly from the Restoration comedy and Restoration drama, and their noble subjects, to the quickly developing melodrama (Munns 97–100).|$|E
25|$|The Bhutanese Standard for a Dzongkha {{keyboard}} layout standardizes the layout for typing Dzongkha, and other languages using the Tibetan script, in Bhutan. This standard layout was formulated by the Dzongkha Development Commission and Department of Information Technology in Bhutan. The Dzongkha {{keyboard layout}} <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>easy</b> {{to learn as}} the key sequence essentially follows the order of letters in the Dzongkha and Tibetan alphabet. The layout has been available in Linux since 2004.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of the vertical steam generating bank {{is similar to the}} vertical economizer, which based on experience <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>easy</b> to keep clean. Vertical flue gas flow path improves the cleanability with high dust loading. To minimize the risk for plugging and maximize the efficiency of cleaning both the generating bank and the economizers are arranged on generous side spacing. Plugging of a two drum boiler bank is often caused by the tight spacing between the tubes.|$|E
50|$|Black garden ants <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>easy</b> to keep, {{this makes}} them an {{incredibly}} popular {{choice for the}} casual ant farmer.|$|R

60|$|The Forester lesson {{proved to}} <b>be</b> a <b>very</b> <b>easy</b> one. There <b>were</b> only three new letters in it, and those three <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>easy</b> to write. In fine, {{at the end}} of the four days, when Mary Bell was to go home, Mary Erskine could read, write, and spell her name very respectably well.|$|R
25|$|Although not {{particularly}} high, these mountains are rugged {{and should not}} be underestimated. Severe weather conditions in the North Shore Mountains often contrast dramatically with mild conditions in nearby Vancouver. This is especially true in winter, but even in summer, large precipices are hidden very close to popular hiking trails and it <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>easy</b> to get lost, despite being in sight of the city. Those who venture into the North Shore Mountains for whatever reason should be well prepared at any time of year.|$|E
25|$|During takeoff, {{both the}} ailerons and flaps are lowered, {{which is a}} {{relatively}} uncommon design approach but results in substantially elevated STOL performance. The flaps can be deployed to an extreme range, extending out at full to a 58 degree position; the flight manual notes that the full setting is recommended only for performing emergency landings. In the skies, the Beaver {{is relatively easy to}} handle, having been described as possessing light and comfortable controls; however, effective application of the rudder is necessitated in order to counteract adverse yaw. It should be flown with a relatively nose-low pitch attitude to maintain airspeed. Reportedly, the aircraft <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>easy</b> to land, even upon less calm water condition.|$|E
25|$|The key to {{the ability}} of a {{frequency}} synthesizer to generate multiple frequencies is the divider placed between the output and the feedback input. This is usually {{in the form of a}} digital counter, with the output signal acting as a clock signal. The counter is preset to some initial count value, and counts down at each cycle of the clock signal. When it reaches zero, the counter output changes state and the count value is reloaded. This circuit is straightforward to implement using flip-flops, and because it is digital in nature, <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>easy</b> to interface to other digital components or a microprocessor. This allows the frequency output by the synthesizer to be easily controlled by a digital system.|$|E

25|$|Biological {{weapons are}} {{difficult}} to detect, economical and easy to use, making them appeal to the terrorists. The cost of a biological weapon {{is estimated to be}} about 0.05 percent the cost of a conventional weapon in order to produce similar numbers of mass casualties per kilometer square. Moreover, their production <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>easy</b> as common technology can be used to produce biological warfare, like that used in production of vaccines, foods, spray devices, beverages and antibiotics. A major factor about biological warfare that attracts terrorists is that they can easily escape, before the government agencies or secret agencies have even started their investigation. This is because the potential organism has incubation period of 3 to 7 days, after which the results begin to appear, thereby giving the terrorists a lead.|$|E
25|$|N. lamarckia {{is grown}} as an ornamental, and for low-grade timber and paper. The timber {{is used for}} plywood, light construction, pulp and paper, boxes and crates, dug-out canoes, and {{furniture}} components. Kadamba yields a pulp of satisfactory brightness and performance as a hand sheet. The wood can be easily impregnated with synthetic resins to increase its density and compressive strength. The wood has a density of 290–560kg/cu m at 15% moisture content, a fine to medium texture; straight grain; low luster and has no characteristic odor or taste. It is easy to work, with hand and machine tools, cuts cleanly, gives a very good surface and is easy to nail. The timber air dries rapidly {{with little or no}} degrade. Kadamba wood <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>easy</b> to preserve using either open tank or pressure-vacuum systems.|$|E
25|$|Kademlia {{routing tables}} {{consist of a}} list for each bit of the node ID. (e.g. if a node ID {{consists}} of 128 bits, a node will keep 128 such lists.) A list has many entries. Every entry in a list holds the necessary data to locate another node. The data in each list entry is typically the IP address, port, and node ID of another node. Every list corresponds to a specific distance from the node. Nodes that can go in the nth list must have a differing nth bit from the node's ID; the first n-1 bits of the candidate ID must match those of the node's ID. This means that it <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>easy</b> to populate the first list as 1/2 of the nodes in the network are far away candidates. The next list can use only 1/4 of the nodes in the network (one bit closer than the first), etc.|$|E

25|$|According to the transtheoretical {{model of}} {{behavior}} change, {{also known as}} the stages of change model, states that there are five stages towards behavior change. The five stages, between which individuals may transition before achieving complete change, are precontemplation, contemplation, preparation for action, action, and maintenance. At the precontemplation stage, an individual {{may or may not be}} aware of a problem but has no thought of changing their behavior. From precontemplation to contemplation, the individual begins thinking about changing a certain behavior. During preparation, the individual begins his plans for change, and during the action stage the individual begins to exhibit new behavior consistently. An individual finally enters the maintenance stage once they exhibit the new behavior consistently for over six months. A problem faced with the stages of change model is that it <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>easy</b> for a person to enter the maintenance stage and then fall back into earlier stages. Factors that contribute to this decline include external factors such as weather or seasonal changes, and/or personal issues a person is dealing with.|$|E
25|$|For example, in act 1, scene 2, the {{scenario}} is that Jenny and other girls are walking to Mahagonny. The music is surprisingly simple; {{just a simple}} solo with a short chorus and sparse orchestration. The music is not some baroque contrapuntal scheme, {{nor is it a}} Romantic forest of sound; rather, the music <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>easy</b> to listen to. This music setting matches with the idea of making music accessible to the public, and not just for educated artists. The music style also displays influences from popular music. During this time, American jazz was a sensation in Europe; since opera is set in America, {{it is not surprising that}} the tune and the beat have a jazz influence. The orchestration, also includes such non-classical instruments as a saxophone, a decidedly jazz instrument. By using a jazz style in the music, Weill immediately associates the action as happening in America. In addition to making a relatively exotic sound, Weill manages to incorporate the jazz style in the song without making it seem incongruous; the American and European music are seamlessly joined under Weill's hands.|$|E
25|$|At {{the other}} end of the scale, balls that bounce {{slightly}} closer to the batsman than the good length are said to be full pitched or overpitched or described as a half volley. These are often easier for the batsman to play than the good length because they do not have time to move much after bouncing off the seam and, arriving at the batsmen low to the ground, are ideal for drive strokes. However, in conditions favourable to swing bowling full pitched bowling gives the ball more time to move through the air challenging the batsman weigh up the risk of being able to play drives against uncertainty about the swing. Closer still to the batsman's feet is the yorker. An effective yorker's length will be difficult to pick early, forcing the batsman back into the crease. Additionally, because it bounces at the batsmen's feet, a well bowled yorker is not playable by a conventional cricket shot. If the ball fails to bounce at all before reaching the batsman it is labelled a full toss or beam ball. It <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>easy</b> for a batsman to play such a delivery as it will not have deviated at all from bouncing off the pitch.|$|E
30|$|Trajectories of a Poisson lazy clock θt(ω)=gt(N(ω)) {{on a fixed}} {{interval}} [0,T] <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>easy</b> {{to obtain}} thanks to the properties of Poisson jump times.|$|R
