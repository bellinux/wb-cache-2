40|$|This paper {{describes}} a local update scheme for the algorithm of Sugiyama and Misue (IEEE Trans. on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics 21 (1991) 876 – 892) for <b>drawing</b> <b>views</b> of compound graphs. A view is an abstract {{representation of a}} compound graph; it is generated by contracting subgraphs into meta nodes. Starting with an initial view, the underlying compound graph is explored by repeatedly expanding or contracting meta nodes. The novelty is a totally local update scheme of the algorithm of Sugiyama and Misue. It is more efficient than redrawing the graph entirely, because the expensive steps of the algorithm, e. g., level assignment or crossing minimization, are restricted to the modified part of the compound graph. Also, the locality of the updates preserves the userrsquos mental map: nodes not affected by the expand or contract operation keep their levels and their relative order; expanded edges take the same course as the corresponding contracted edge...|$|E
40|$|SPIRIT is an independent, {{technical}} {{program which}} aids an architecture design. It {{has been created}} for architects and specialists of related trades. This program {{is divided into three}} functional parts: threedimensional functions, two-dimensional functions and a module part. The communication between these parts is devoid of problems. Rich and light to develop data bases which include information about walls, windows, doors, furnitures and others elements are the integral part of this program. Elements are connected to libraries of symbols. A two-dimensional drawing does not stray to methods knowing from other CAD-programs. An interesting set of functions helping by <b>drawing</b> <b>views</b> is ARCH 2 D. It lets drawing walls with selected thickness and inserting openings like windows and doors. Three dimensional elements are made from simple masses like a plate, a sphere, a cylinder, a torus. Every object can be seen from whichever perspective you like. Most helpful is there a shader function which creates coloured view including light and shadow. Every three-dimensional object can be converted to vectorial, two-dimensional drawing which can be plotted or enlarged...|$|E

40|$|Resumo: A força da ficção para pensar o real reside na linguagem. Ao se mostrarem como ficção, Literatura e Jornalismo podem desvencilhar-se da tentativa de mimetizar o real e buscar por novos mundos, novas maneiras de significar o devir, o tempo. Qual seria o potencial de se conceber a realidade como parte de uma política ficcional que dirige e arregimenta os corpos? Poderia o Jornalismo suspender, ainda que momentaneamente, a noção de real, deixando o leitor à deriva, à procura de novas âncoras? Pré-lançada na Festa Internacional Literária de Paraty em agosto de 2006, piauí traz, mesmo que indiretamente, uma reflexão sobre as relações e tensões entre Jornalismo, Literatura, Ficção e Realidade. Livre para pautar os temas de cada edição, sem se basear no enfoque da agenda jornalística hegemônica, sua postura garante espaço para o inusitado tanto em termos de forma quanto de conteúdo. Inserida na área de Estudos Culturais (Hall, 2004, 2007) essa pesquisa analisa o descentramento da identidade e evidencia que o sujeito é afetado pela Cultura, e que é, ao mesmo tempo, um produtor de Cultura. O {{principal}} objetivo do estudo é examinar os sentidos envolvidos e revolvidos na linguagem da piauí: Jornalismo, Literatura, Ficção, Realidade, Jornalismo Literário, Cultura, todos eles dançam na instabilidade constitutiva que a publicação propõe e impõe. A escolha do corpus foi realizada pelo método de Amostra Intencional anual e é constituído por cinco edições: a primeira lançada nas bancas (outubro de 2006) e as quatro de aniversário (outubro de 2007, 2008, 2009 e 2010). Juntas elas serão estudadas em detalhe, com a intenção de observar as identidades propostas na publicação. Identidades que ora se resolvem, ora se revolvem na indeterminação. Levando em conta o caráter aberto do objeto (Eco, 2003), as inúmeras possibilidades de entrada e a complexidade da publicação determinaram a busca por metodologias complementares. Análise do Discurso, Semiótica, Análise Literária, Teoria das Representações Sociais, Estudo de Caso, Análise de Conteúdo, todas elas foram percorridas no exercício de estabelecer o perfil metodológico da pesquisa. Ocorre que ao longo da caminhada, alguns de seus recursos de análise foram selecionados, mas me ative ao movimento do cartógrafo, que além de desenhar paisagens em movimento, recorre a recursos de análise que não são unos, inteiriços, fechados em si mesmos, isto é, também estão em movimento, também podem ser cartografados. Por esse motivo assumi o risco de usar recursos de diversas metodologias, por crer que posso passear por elas. A proposta é trabalhar como o cartógrafo, cujo desenho "acompanha e se faz ao mesmo tempo que os movimentos de transformação da paisagem" (Rolnik, 1989 : 15). O objeto agora passa a ser chamado de paisagemAbstract: The {{strength of}} fiction {{to think about}} reality lies in the language. By showing themselves as fiction, Literature and Journalism can get free from the effort of copying what is considered real in order to look for new worlds, new ways to give meaning to the passing time. What would be the potential of conceiving reality {{as one of the}} fictional politics that guides and controls the bodies? Could Journalism not take into account, even for a moment, the notion of reality, letting the reader search for new anchors? Pre-released at FLIP, Festa Internacional Literária de Paraty in August 2006, piauí brings even indirectly a deep thought about the relations and tensions among Journalism, Literature, Fiction and Reality. Free to choose its themes at every edition, without basing itself on the hegemonic journalistic agenda, its perspective guarantees space for the unexpected in terms of form and content. As a branch of Cultural Studies (Hall, 2004, 2007) this research analyses the descentered identity and shows that the subject is affected by Culture and is, at the same time, a cultural producer. The most important aim {{of this study is to}} exam the meaning involved and revolved in the language of piauí: Journalism, Literature, Fiction, Reality, Literary Journalism, Culture, they all dance in the constitutive instability that the magazine proposes and imposes. The corpus choice was made by using the annual Intentional Sampling and is constituted by five editions: the first one, released at the newsstands (in October 2006) and the other four, when completing its anniversaries (October 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010). They will be studied in deep, with the intention of observing the proposed identities in the publication. Identities that one time resolve themselves by assuming its boundaries, on the other revolve in the indetermination. Considering the open features of the object (Eco, 2003), the several possibilities of entering in the research and also the magazine complexity determined the search for complementary methodologies. Discourse Analysis, Semiotics, Literary Analysis, the Theory of Social Representations, Case Study, all them were seen when establishing the methodological perspective. However, during the process, when walking through them, some of their recourses were chosen, but I really got interested in the cartographer's movement, who more than <b>drawing</b> <b>views</b> in movement looks for analysis resources that are not unified, closed to themselves, I mean, they are in movement too, can also be visited and for this reason I assumed the risk of using resources from different methodologies, because I believe that I can tour through them. The goal is to work as the cartographer, whose drawing route "follow and appear while the changing movements of the sights are going on" (Rolnik, 1989 : 15). From now on the object will be called vie...|$|E
