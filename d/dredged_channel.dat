5|$|The {{planners}} then examined {{whether a}} commando force was feasible {{to accomplish the}} task. An unusually high spring tide was due in March 1942 which would allow a light ship to pass over the sand banks in the estuary and approach the docks, bypassing the heavily defended <b>dredged</b> <b>channel.</b> The approach was too shallow for an infantry landing ship, but the planners believed if a destroyer could be lightened it might have a draft shallow enough to enable it to get through.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the bridge's construction, Pleasure Island was {{accessible}} only by ferry. In 1907, the Pleasure Beach Ferry Company was given the rights to build a movable toll bridge. A series of trestles were built across the tidal flats with a swing span across the <b>dredged</b> <b>channel.</b> The swing span was constructed in 1927, but in the Great Depression the Beach Ferry Company transferred control of the bridge {{to the city of}} Bridgeport. The tolls were removed and the bridge continued to be used after Pleasure Beach's closing in 1968, until the 1996 fire. Repairs were made to the bridge in 1988 with money from the state. In 1994, the need to replace the bridge resulted in a state and federal promise of $20 million, but this was rejected by the Connecticut Department of Transportation in 1995.|$|E
5|$|Slavas draft had {{increased}} {{too much to}} allow her to use the <b>dredged</b> <b>channel</b> between Hiiumaa Island and Vormsi (Worms) Island so she was ordered to wait until all the other deep-draft ships had entered the channel and then scuttle herself at the channel entrance. However, the Sailors' Committee organized on the ship after the February Revolution had ordered the engine room abandoned for fear of sinking, and she grounded on a shoal southeast of the channel because {{there was no one to}} obey the captain's order to stop. A number of destroyers evacuated the crew before the rear 12-inch magazine exploded at 11:58. However this was not deemed sufficient and three destroyers were ordered to torpedo her. Only one of their six torpedoes worked and Slava settled on the shallow bottom with a hole on the starboard side near the funnel. She was officially struck off the Navy List on 29 May 1918 by the Soviets and scrapped in 1935 by the Estonians.|$|E

During Operation Albion, {{the invasion of}} the Estonian islands of Saaremaa (Ösel), Hiiumaa (Dagö) and Muhu (Moon), in October 1917, the ship defended the southern entrance to Moon Sound on 17 October. When the German minesweepers began clearing the minefields guarding the entrance, they were attacked by Bayan and the predreadnought , while the predreadnought [...] engaged the dreadnoughts [...] and [...] defending the minesweepers. Slava was hit multiple times by the German ships and Bakirev ordered his forces to withdraw. Bayan was the last ship to withdraw, but she was hit once by a [...] shell from König before she moved out of range. The shell penetrated the deck near the forward turret and started a fire among the flammable material in the cable compartment that was not extinguished until the next day. Fragments from the shell destroyed a bulkhead and loosened some plates of the ship's bottom. The location of the fire near the forward magazine forced it to be flooded as a precaution. Between the leaky plates and the flooded magazine, the ship took about [...] aboard and her draught forward increased to [...] The shell killed five men and wounded three more. Despite her increased draught, Bayan was able to pass through the <b>dredged</b> <b>channel</b> connecting the northern and southern parts of Moon Sound later that day.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the techniques used {{for developing a}} two-dimensional fine sediment transport model {{for the purpose of}} informing the design of port facilities and for the evaluation of siltation rates in a port area with high ambient turbidity and limited baseline data. The wave, current and sediment models were coupled to predict fine sediment transport using the DHI MIKE 21 suite of models. The process of mud deposition was simulated with feasible parameter settings. Extensive sensitivity testing was undertaken to achieve confidence in the model and to determine the influence of various input parameters on the model performance. In the pristine environment of the study area, where natural or <b>dredged</b> <b>channels</b> do not exist, the sediment transport modelling relied on wave, current, and suspended sediment measurements to gain confidence in the modelled outputs. Whilst the modelling results were used to inform the selection of alternative port layouts, considerable reliance was placed on specialist engineering judgement based on interpretation of site conditions, met-ocean model input parameters, modelled siltation estimates, and reported siltation in <b>dredged</b> <b>channels</b> in similar environments...|$|R
