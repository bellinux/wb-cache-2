5|$|Bush had {{originally}} outlined an ambitious domestic agenda, but <b>his</b> <b>priorities</b> were significantly altered following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Wars were waged in Afghanistan and Iraq, {{and there were}} significant domestic debates regarding immigration, healthcare, Social Security, economic policy, and treatment of terrorist detainees. Over an eight-year period, Bush's once-high approval ratings steadily declined, while his disapproval numbers increased significantly. In 2007, the United States entered the longest post-World War II recession.|$|E
5|$|In 1989 Capuano ran {{for mayor}} {{a third time}} in and won. Capuano served as mayor from 1990 to 1999, where he earned a {{reputation}} as a hands-on administrator. One of <b>his</b> <b>priorities</b> was to lower the city's population density, which at time was the highest of any New England municipality, by using state grants to demolish several buildings and replace them with playgrounds and parking spaces. As mayor, Capuano oversaw the reduction of school class sizes to a maximum of 19 students.|$|E
5|$|Among those {{determined}} that London {{should have a}} permanent orchestra of similar excellence were Sir John Reith, director-general of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), and the conductor Sir Thomas Beecham. In 1928 they opened discussions about jointly setting up such an ensemble, but after 18 months of negotiations {{it became clear that}} the corporation and the conductor had irreconcilable priorities. Beecham demanded more personal control of the orchestra and repertoire than the BBC was willing to concede, and <b>his</b> <b>priorities</b> were the opera house and the concert hall rather than the broadcasting studio. The BBC went ahead without him, and under its director of music, Adrian Boult, launched the BBC Symphony Orchestra in October 1930, to immense acclaim.|$|E

5|$|Baird was {{appointed}} President of the Treasury Board on February 6, 2006. Following his appointment, {{he said that}} one of <b>his</b> <b>priorities</b> would be to prevent government jobs from being relocated from Ottawa to other regions for political purposes. Baird also indicated that his government was not planning to introduce job cuts or initiate a radical reduction in the size of government. In June 2006 he announced the creation of a three-member panel to advise the federal government on grant and contribution programs and accountability issues. One of the members was Frances Lankin, a former Ontario New Democratic Party cabinet minister.|$|E
5|$|Zahorchak said {{he plans}} to install a system that would provide regular updates to {{families}} on the academic performance of their children and push them toward tangible improvement goals. In response to recent student violence problems at the William Allen High School, Zahorchak identified one of <b>his</b> <b>priorities</b> as strengthening the district's code of conduct and citizenship programs. He also announced he would seek to replace retiring teachers with highly skilled minority candidates, and would create incentive programs to lure top students into teaching positions if they agreed to spend at least five years teaching in Allentown schools.|$|E
5|$|A liberal {{member of}} Congress, Tierney voted {{along with other}} Democratic Representatives from Massachusetts. He sat on the House Committee on Education and Labor, where <b>his</b> <b>priorities</b> {{included}} green energy and increased college access. He co-authored several pieces of legislation, including the Green Jobs Act of 2007 and the College Affordability and Accountability Act of 2008. He is {{the former chairman of}} the Subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs, where he helped establish the Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan. From 1996 to 2012, Tierney comfortably won re-election in each cycle. He faced tougher challenges after his wife Patrice was convicted of felony tax fraud in 2010, narrowly defeating his Republican opponent in 2012. In the 2014 election, he lost the Democratic primary to Seth Moulton, who went on to hold the seat in the general election.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{his early}} {{resolution}} {{not to allow}} politics to impede upon his legal career, Maxwell's resolute support of the Union during the American Civil War, and of the statehood movement for West Virginia, refocused <b>his</b> <b>priorities.</b> Maxwell's political affiliation had been Republican, and he became {{actively involved in the}} formation of the state of West Virginia in 1863. Just weeks prior to the state's creation on June 20 of that year, he began his political career when he was elected to represent the Third Senatorial District in the inaugural session of the West Virginia Senate in June 1863. During his tenure in the senate, which lasted until 1866, Maxwell served as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. In his position as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, he played a prominent role in the passage of the state's earliest legislation.|$|E
5|$|Krichell's next {{target was}} second baseman Snuffy Stirnweiss from the University of North Carolina. He {{initially}} {{tried to convince}} him to bypass football for baseball, but the player refused until his father's death soon after his college graduation altered <b>his</b> <b>priorities,</b> leaving him as the sole supporter {{of his mother and}} younger brother. Krichell signed him to a contract soon afterwards. In a mass tryout for the Yankees team, Krichell scouted first baseman Whitey Ford. Krichell realised Ford had a strong arm, and recommended he tried pitching. Developing an effective fast curveball, Ford helped his team win the New York City sandlot ball championship, and was signed by Krichell for $7,000 in 1947 ($ in 2010). Ford later became a Hall of Famer and an ace of the Yankees for most of the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Overlapping the {{military}} chain of command, {{there was a}} plenipotentiary of the Foreign Office, Felix Benzler, reporting to the Foreign Minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, and for economic affairs, a representative of Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring, Franz Neuhausen. These power structures competed with each other, {{to a greater extent}} than anywhere else in occupied Europe. Meyszner's appointment further complicated an already complex situation, as prior to this decision, Turner had been responsible for police and security matters. Meyszner had to formally acknowledge Bader as his superior but received his orders from Hitler and Himmler. One of <b>his</b> <b>priorities</b> was to improve coordination of policies towards the Volksdeutsche (or Germans of Yugoslavia), concentrated in the Banat region, as the decision had been made in late 1941 to subject them to conscription in order to raise a Waffen-SS division. This decision, approved by Hitler a few days before Meyszner's appointment, had strengthened Himmler's case for a HSSPF in Belgrade.|$|E

5|$|The current {{training}} ground {{is located at}} Bodymoor Heath near Kingsbury in north Warwickshire, the site for which was purchased by former chairman Doug Ellis in the early 1970s from a local farmer. Although Bodymoor Heath was state-of-the-art in the 1970s, by the late 1990s the facilities had started to look dated. In November 2005, Ellis and Aston Villa plc announced {{a state of the}} art GB£13million redevelopment of Bodymoor in two phases. However, work on Bodymoor was suspended by Ellis due to financial problems, and was left in an unfinished state until new owner Randy Lerner made it one of <b>his</b> <b>priorities</b> to make the site {{one of the best in}} world football. The new {{training ground}} was officially unveiled on 6 May 2007, by then manager Martin O'Neill, then team captain Gareth Barry and 1982 European Cup winning team captain Dennis Mortimer, with the Aston Villa squad moving in for the 2007–08 season.|$|E

25|$|Quinn won the Democratic {{nomination}} for lieutenant governor in March 2002, and subsequently won {{the general election}} on the Democratic ticket alongside gubernatorial nominee, Rod Blagojevich. In Illinois, candidates for Lieutenant Governor and Governor at that time ran in separate primary elections, but were conjoined as a single ticket for the general election. This same ticket won re-election in 2006, where Quinn was unopposed in the primary. While Lieutenant Governor, according to his official biography, <b>his</b> <b>priorities</b> were consumer advocacy, environmental protection, health care, broadband deployment, and veterans' affairs.|$|E
25|$|Reid called {{immigration}} reform one of <b>his</b> <b>priorities</b> at the 110th Congress. He supports the DREAM Act (Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act), {{which would give}} certain high school graduates who {{had arrived in the}} U.S. illegally, conditional legal status so they could attend college or enlist in the military. They could then obtain permanent legal residency after completing two years of military service or two years of college. In June 2009, Reid announced his intention to enact a new guest worker program as part of a comprehensive {{immigration reform}} bill.|$|E

His Vice Presidential candidate Ankvab talked about the achievements of the current government, claiming that 10,622 people had received a total of 67million rubles in assistance. He also praised the fact that patients had been sent to Russian medical institutions to receive free treatment.|$|E
25|$|Around 1938, Faith at Work {{transformed}} into Moral Re-Armament. However, controversy grew because the latter dissociated from Christian churches and New Testament orientation. Moral Re-Armament also took an increasing share of Shoemaker's {{time and the}} facilities of Calvary House in New York. Shoemaker re-evaluated <b>his</b> <b>priorities,</b> including with Frank Buchman and the Oxford Group, {{as well as his}} commitment to evangelism, devotion to the Church of Christ in general and to the Episcopal Church. Efforts to work through these concerns in 1940 and 1941 proved fruitless. In the closing months of 1941, Calvary Church's vestry formally asked Moral Re Armament to stop using Calvary House.|$|E
25|$|Throughout early 1999, The Undertaker and his Ministry of Darkness {{had been}} feuding with WWF owner Mr. McMahon, {{trying to gain}} control of the Federation. To break Vince's spirits they began {{targeting}} his daughter Stephanie. Worried about his daughter, Vince shifted focus from his Corporation stable to Stephanie. With Vince occupied, his son Shane gradually took over the leadership of the Corporation. On April 12, Shane kicked Vince, Pat Patterson, and Gerald Brisco out of the Corporation. His rationale was that there was no room in the Corporation for the old and that Vince no longer had <b>his</b> <b>priorities</b> straight. Shane then slapped his father, saying that the strong, ruthless man he knew was gone.|$|E
