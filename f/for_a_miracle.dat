5|$|After Gallagher's {{team had}} {{returned}} to the Special Forces Camp, Van Cleeff waited on the runway for two minutes to extract the survivors, but when nobody appeared he pulled the throttle and took off. As soon as Van Cleeff's aircraft was airborne, another C-130 pilot reported to General McLaughlin that the evacuation had been completed, and the facility could now be destroyed at will. Van Cleeff quickly notified all aircraft in the vicinity that he had just reinserted the CCT. Gallagher's team searched the Special Forces compound, the Americal Division battalion command post, and the artillery compound, but everybody either had been evacuated or was dead. Additionally, Khâm Đức was in North Vietnamese hands, so Gallagher and the other two men ran to the ditch beside the runway, where they tried to make contact with the aircraft overhead, but the radio was disabled along with all other equipment. While waiting <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>miracle,</b> members of the CCT clashed with North Vietnamese troops who had set up a machine gun position beneath the wing of Delmore's crashed C-130, and successfully disabled their opponent's weapon.|$|E

25|$|At {{the request}} of the reincarnated Saint Sabbat, the Tanith First-and-Only is summoned to the remote and tactically {{insignificant}} world Herodor. The Civitas Beati, a holy city dedicated to the Saint, is under assault from a legion of Blood Pact, led by Enok Innokenti. While the Ghosts prepare to defend the city alongside the local PDF force, Gaunt learns the truth of the situation: the woman posing as the reincarnated Saint is Sanian, an esholi whom the Ghosts encountered on Hagia. Utterly convinced that she is Sabbat, Sanian has clearly lost her mind. Lord-General Lugo – whose career has been unstable since his disgrace at Hagia – plans to use her as propaganda, and does not care that she is an imposter; he believes that he will be forever remembered as the man responsible <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> in the Sabbat Worlds. As far as untold thousands of pilgrims, Imperial and archenemy troops are concerned, Sanian is the true Saint.|$|E
25|$|On December 25, 1991, Ang Totoong Buhay ni Pacita M. {{was part}} of the 1991 Metro Manila Film Festival. The film tells the story of Pacita M., a singer-entertainer in a seedy Quezon City nightclub whose {{daughter}} Grace {{was shot in the head}} by a stray bullet just as she was preparing to go off to college. Although initially Pacita held out <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> to save her daughter form her vegetative state, eventually she relents and seeks to allow Grace a dignified death by turning off her respirator. The emotional battle becomes a personal epiphany for Pacita. This highly acclaimed movie directed by Elwood Perez bravely tackles the sensitive issue of euthanasia. Aunor won numerous awards for her performance, including the Metro Manila Film Festival Best Actress, her fourth Gawad Urian, and her third consecutive Best Actress trophy from the Film Academy of the Philippines. She won from Star Awards and from the Young Critics Circle.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of these {{investigations}} and the examination in Rome of the results, on 2 April 1993, Pope John Paul II approved the pursual of the Roman phase of the cause, declaring Edmund Rice to be venerable. Two years later, the same Pope approved a miracle attributed to Edmund Rice's intercession. The miracle occurred in 1976, when Kevin Ellison of Newry, had been given only 48 hours to live due to complications from a gangrenous colon, and an apparent lack of viable colon tissue (a conclusion reached by five doctors after hours in surgery). A family friend, Christian Brother Laserian O'Donnell, gave Ellison's parents a relic of Edmund Rice. Many friends prayed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> through the intercession of Rice and a special Mass was offered for Ellison's recovery. Only the relic of Edmund Rice was placed at the bedside of the dying man. The latter survived the 48-hour period during which he was supposed to die, and more besides. Upon investigation, surgeons discovered a considerable length of previously undetected colon. Ellison fully recovered after a few weeks.|$|E

He can often {{be seen on the}} show in minor appearances, although there have been some episodes that feature him heavily, including the first episode of The Simpsons. In that episode, [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire" [...] (season one, 1989), Homer discovers that he has no money to buy Christmas presents for the family. Desperate <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>miracle,</b> he and Bart go to the greyhound racing track on Christmas Eve in hopes of winning some money. Although Homer has inside information on which dog is the most likely to win, he instead bets on a last-minute entry, Santa's Little Helper (here despite being brown), believing the dog's Christmas-inspired name to be a sign. However, the greyhound finishes last. As Homer and Bart leave the track, they watch the dog's owner abandon him for losing the race. Bart pleads with Homer to keep the dog as a pet and he agrees after it affectionately licks him on the cheek. When Bart and Homer return home, Santa's Little Helper is assumed {{by the rest of the}} family to be a Christmas present.|$|E
500|$|Early {{traditions and}} stories explain this verse as a miracle {{performed}} by Muhammad, following requests of {{some members of}} the Quraysh. Most Muslim commentators accept the authenticity of those traditions. The following verse 54:2, [...] "But if they see a Sign, they turn away, and say, 'This is (but) transient magic'" [...] is taken in the support of this view. The classical commentator Ibn Kathir provides a list of the early traditions mentioning the incident: A tradition transmitted on the authority of Anas bin Malik states that Muhammad split the moon after the pagan Meccans asked <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>miracle.</b> Another tradition from Malik transmitted through other chains of narrations, mentions that the mount Nur was visible between the two parts of the moon (Mount Nur is located in Hijaz. Muslims believe that Muhammad received his first revelations from God in a cave on this mountain, Cave Hira'). A tradition narrated on the authority of Jubayr ibn Mut'im with a single chain of transmission says that the two parts of the moon stood on two mountains. This tradition further states that the Meccan responded by saying [...] "Muhammad has taken us by his magic... If he was able to take us by magic, he {{will not be able to}} do so with all people." [...] Traditions transmitted on the authority of Ibn Abbas briefly mention the incident and do not provide much details.
