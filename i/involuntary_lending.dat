40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{empirical}} relevance of various conjectures about what determined whether creditors would issue loans {{to developing countries}} in the 1980 s. With {{the onset of the}} debt crisis, private creditors began to honour debtors who improved economic performance and policies. Private creditors were not prepared to compensate for unfavourable developments in the world market with additional lending. Small borrowers who did not benefit from <b>involuntary</b> <b>lending</b> had great difficulty attracting further capital inflows when they were hit by external shocks. The paper finds that if debtors are given more incentive to meet debt obligations through more efficient economic policies, creditors {{will be more likely to}} share the credit risks triggered by unfavourable developments in the world market. As the distribution of credit risks between debtors and creditors improves, the capital outflow from developing countries will be checked.

40|$|In {{a future}} {{sovereign}} debt crisis, debt restructurings are inevitable simply {{because there is}} no alternative. Private lending becomes simply unavailable. The commercial banks were asked to lend to Mexico in early 1995 as part of the U. S. Government rescue plan, but the money never materialized. 3 The banks 2 ̆ 7 experience of <b>involuntary</b> <b>lending</b> during the 1980 s debt crisis was so unpleasant that they are unlikely to increase exposure to a troubled debtor in a crisis today. Other sources of finance are no more likely to yield support. Mexico was unable to return to the capital markets until six months after the crisis blew up. 4 For political and practical reasons, the U. S. government is unlikely to lend again as it did to Mexico. Despite recent increases in the IMF 2 ̆ 7 s power to lend to countries in emergencies, multilateral funds remain insufficient to cope with large scale crises. In any case, just {{as it did in the}} 1980 s, the IMF would probably condition any finance upon some debt restructuring agreement between the debtor and its creditors. Coupled with the absence of new money, this means that countries will have to try to reach some agreement with their creditors. However, the current legal and institutional framework is embarrassingly unprepared to handle a sovereign debt restructuring...|$|E
40|$|Banks closed over 30 million debit/checking {{consumer}} accounts involuntarily in 2001 - 2005 for excessive overdrafts, {{with these}} former bank customers having limited or no subsequent {{access to the}} formal banking system. Using a new county-level database, we analyze the determinants of these involuntary account closures, focusing on explanations relating to household economics and financial decision making ability, social capital, bank policies, and credit access through payday <b>lending.</b> <b>Involuntary</b> closures are more frequent in counties with a larger fraction of single mothers, lower education levels, lower wealth, and higher rates of unemployment. Social capital also matters, with closures higher in counties with higher rates of property crime and lower rates of electoral participation. Bank policies relate to closures, with more closures in counties with more competitive banking markets and more multi-market banks. Finally, using national data and a natural experiment, we find that access to payday lending leads to higher rates of involuntary account closure...|$|R
40|$|Self-employment {{among older}} age groups is rising. A better {{understanding}} of the role of self-employment in extending the working lives of individuals is, therefore, relevant from a policy perspective. By bridging the gap in the literature on work/retirement decision-making and entrepreneurship, the present study examines the factors associated with entry into self-employment post-retirement, after a worker has left a regular salaried position. This decision is modelled as a choice between full retirement and prolonged labour force participation, in the form of either a typical wage-providing job or self-employment. Data were derived from the Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute Work and Retirement Panel, an ongoing longitudinal survey of older workers (50 years and over) employed by three private sector organisations and employed as civil servants in the Netherlands. These data were then analysed using multinomial logistic regression analysis. The results of this study show that the decision to pursue self-employment is primarily taken by retirees with relatively high levels of financial and human capital (wealth and educational attainment), those possessing entrepreneurial attitudes (high self-efficacy scores) and those who perceive their retirements to be completely <b>involuntary.</b> The results <b>lend</b> support to self-employment being selected as a postretirement path through opportunity rather than out of necessity. The fact that the retirements of the studied population were generally quite early, while not considered involuntary also suggests that the timing of the decision to retire may be driven by the emergence of new (business) opportunities.
