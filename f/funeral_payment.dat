40|$|There {{is a long}} {{tradition}} {{in the assessment of}} UK social policy of examining benefit entitlement and access, yet little attention has been paid towards benefits associated with bereavement and, in particular, what happens for those people who cannot afford a funeral and require state assistance. This is despite the fact that every year approximately one in ten deaths in the UK results in a claim to the Department for Work and Pensions' <b>Funeral</b> <b>Payment</b> for a contribution towards funeral costs. Beyond a paper in this journal over ten years ago, no research has been conducted into how the scheme is administered and what happens to those people who claim. Drawing on a study with both successful and unsuccessful <b>Funeral</b> <b>Payment</b> claimants, funeral directors and key stakeholders, this paper evaluates the <b>Funeral</b> <b>Payment</b> in terms of eligibility and entitlement, and timing and cost. It argues that closer attention needs to be paid to the issue of financial support for funerals to avoid the evolution of an unwieldy system {{at a time when the}} UK death rate is predicted to rise owing to the ageing of the population...|$|E
40|$|The period {{immediately}} after death {{has often been}} overlooked in British social policy, particularly in relation to funerals. The challenges presented by projected increases in the death rate owing to the ageing UK population mean that greater attention to state support for funding funerals is required. This article examines issues around current provision of state support for funerals via the Social Fund <b>Funeral</b> <b>Payment,</b> exploring potential failures {{in the way in}} which the payment meets people's needs. It concludes that considerable change is needed to state funeral policy to ensure that those from low-income backgrounds can have a 'good send-off'...|$|E
50|$|A Long Term Care Benefit Plan is {{an option}} to sell a life {{insurance}} policy in return for 30 to 60 percent of the policy value toward long term health care. A <b>funeral</b> benefit <b>payment</b> is made to the account beneficiary when the person receiving care dies. If the benefit amount is spent while the person is still alive, they are still eligible for Medicaid.|$|R
50|$|If {{the insured}} person dies before the benefit period is over, the {{remaining}} benefit account is paid to the family or beneficiary as a final expense payment. When the benefit is spent down, the person is still eligible for Medicaid. All benefit accounts reserve either {{five percent of the}} death benefit or $5,000 (whichever is less) to provide a <b>funeral</b> benefit <b>payment</b> to the account’s beneficiary. These Benefit Plans can be funded through companies such as Life Care Funding and The Lifeline.|$|R
50|$|On 9 January 1946 the {{government}} reorganised {{the health insurance}} system for sharecroppers, tenant farmers, and agricultural workers, with a flat-rate daily indemnity of Lit.28 for women and Lit.60 for men (i.e. 3% and 7% of the average gross industrial wage for 1947) for a maximum of 180 days a year and free medical and hospital assistance provided through INAM.; on 19 April 1946 {{the government}} reorganised the health insurance system for industrial employees, with a daily sickness indemnity equal to 50% of earnings, for a maximum of 180 days a year, a flat-rate maternity indemnity equal to a lump sum of Lit.1000 for 120 days (1% of average gross for industrial wage in 1947), a funeral allowance and free medical, hospital, and pharmaceutical assistance through INAM. On 31 October 1947 the Italian Parliament approved a bill that reorganised the health insurance system for service employees (e.g. banking and commerce), with a daily sickness indemnity equal to 50% of earnings for a maximum of 180 days a year, a flat-rate maternity <b>payment,</b> <b>funeral</b> allowance, and free hospital, medical, and pharmaceutical assistance through INAM.|$|R
40|$|Situated at the {{intersection}} of the Sociology of Death and Sociology of the Family, this paper argues that the organization and funding of funerals is an overlooked and available lens through which to examine cultural and political norms of familial obligation. Drawing on interviews with claimants to the Department for Work and Pensions’ Social Fund <b>Funeral</b> <b>Payment,</b> the paper shows how both responsibility for the organization and payment of a funeral is assumed within families, and how at times this can be overridden by the state. In highlighting the tension between reflexive choice and political norms of family espoused in this policy context, it supports Gilding's (2010) assertion that understanding family practice through reflexivity alone neglects the institutions and conventions within which ‘doing’ family takes place. In so doing, the paper further makes a case for families and relational negotiations and tensions to be more explicitly included within sociological understanding(s) of death more generally...|$|E
40|$|Researchers at the University of Bath have {{examined}} state support available {{for those who}} cannot afford a funeral {{at the point of}} need. They evaluated the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) Social Fund <b>Funeral</b> <b>Payment</b> (FP) through interviews with claimants and key stakeholders. The research concluded that the current system lacks coherence in terms of both the process of application, and how it deals with diverse family relationships. Furthermore, for the 55 % of claimants who are successful in their application, there can be a substantial shortfall between the contribution awarded and the amount required to meet the cost of a funeral. These findings have important implications for existing (and potential future) demand for Public Health Funerals. These are basic funerals which local authorities have a statutory obligation to provide, in circumstances where an individual dies without anyone able or willing to organise and pay for their funeral. In light of the on-going issues with the FP, there is concern that local authorities will be required to provide more Public Health Funerals as the number of deaths per year begins to increase. The viability of these two distinct systems of state provision for funerals requires urgent attention to ensure that public resources are appropriately targeted to those most in need...|$|E
40|$|According to the Cost of Dying figures {{produced}} by Sun Life Direct, {{the average cost}} of dying has risen by 7. 1 % in the past year to £ 7, 622. It is estimated that over 100, 000 people will struggle to pay for a funeral this year alone. The number of deaths in England and Wales is set to increase by 17 % from now until 2037, which could lead to total cost of dying of £ 10. 5 bn {{by the end of this}} period. Expenses associated with funeral costs often get overlooked as there is ever increasing pressure to prioritise for everyday living costs, both at an individual and societal level. The public nature of funerals and the pressure individuals and families can feel to provide a dignified funeral for someone can lead them into making imprudent financial decisions. Increasing numbers of people are seeking financial management advice following bereavement which can have a long term effect on the grief experience and individual's ability to manage. More should be done to encourage people on low incomes to prepare for death through simple advice and guidance. The government should rethink its Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) administered Social Fund <b>Funeral</b> <b>Payment,</b> which is highlighted as 'outdated', 'overly comlex' and 'insufficient' at meeting the needs of the poorest in society...|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The main {{aim of this study}} was the reconstruction of the life histories {{of the members of the}} Steam Engine Maker's Society during the period August 1835 to December 1876, to permit the analysis of labour mobility, unemployment, sickness, ageing, retirement, death and the interaction of these states and events over the life course. Main Topics : The Steam Engine Maker's Database is a relational database, which contains information from the records of the Steam Engine Maker's Society (SEM) about inter-branch transfers, payments of travelling benefit to members seeking work, unemployment benefit payments, sickness benefit payments, superannuation <b>payments</b> and <b>funeral</b> benefit <b>payments.</b> It is particularly useful for the analysis of labour mobility, unemployment, sickness, ageing, retirement, death and the interaction of these states and events over the life course. The database consists of 10 tables: Reports holds information about each SEM Annual Report published between 1835 and 1880. Br_names provides alternative versions of branch names which appear in any Annual Report up to 1879. Also handles any text strings used to identify a branch. Branches holds information about every SEM branch which existed up to those listed in the 1878 Annual Report. Members holds information taken from the branch membership lists and the footnotes in the SEM Annual Reports from 1835 until 1876. Also includes synthesised data covering the 1849, 1857 and 1870 reports, to replace missing data. Widows holds information about members' widows who were listed as entitled to funeral benefit at the end of the branch membership lists in the SEM Annual Reports from 1861 until 1876. Also includes synthesised lists covering the missing 1870 report. Payments holds all payments of sickness benefit to named members listed in the SEM Annual Reports from 1835 until 1876; all payments of unemployment benefit starting in 1837; all payments of superannuation from 1842; and all payments of strike pay from 1875. Items of miscellaneous expenditure are also included wherever there is a named beneficiary. Travelling holds payments of travelling benefit to members seeking work. The only benefit provided under the SEM's initial 1827 rules was travelling relief, whereby a member seeking work could claim from each branch visited 'his supper, one pint of beer, one night's lodging, his breakfast in the morning, and one penny for every mile he may have travelled since last relieved'. The tramping system this benefit formed part of declined in importance after 1850, and the union supplemented it by the payment of member's train fares when travelling to known vacancies. Holds information on the deaths of members, their wives and widows and the <b>payment</b> of <b>funeral</b> benefit taken from the Annual Reports up to the end of 1876. Gaps in the Annual Reports have been filled using data from the Monthly Reports. Reg_book holds information taken from the SEM's manuscript Registration Books, containing information on age, trade and marital status of members on their admission to the union. Rb_event holds information concerning subsequent events listed in the SEM Registration Book Ase_reg holds information taken from the Amalgamated Society of Engineers' (ASE) Registration Book. Many members of the SEM transferred to the ASE on the creation of the latter union in 1851, and in principle this table includes all such ex-members of the SEM, plus a selection of men joining the ASE by other routes. D_cert holds information taken from death certificates of SEM members, including age and cause of death...|$|R
