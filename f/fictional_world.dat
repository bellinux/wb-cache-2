40|$|Some {{works of}} fiction are widely held by critics to have little value, yet these works are not only popular but also widely admired {{in ways that are}} not always appreciated. In this paper I make use of Kendall Walton’s account of <b>fictional</b> <b>worlds</b> to argue that <b>fictional</b> <b>worlds</b> can and often do have value, {{including}} aesthetic value, that is independent of the works that create them. In the process, I critique Walton’s notion of <b>fictional</b> <b>worlds</b> and offer a defense of the study and appreciation of <b>fictional</b> <b>worlds,</b> as distinguished from the {{works of fiction}} with which they are associated...|$|R

Not being a mere literature research, the thesis inquires into issues which are necessarily connected with the <b>fictional</b> <b>worlds</b> theory and which have been so far rarely dealt with, if discussed at all. It contributes to the discussion on advantages and drawbacks of the mimetic approach and of the fiction theory, it {{analyzes the}} possible applicability of the <b>fictional</b> <b>worlds</b> theory in literary history, it attempts to determine the correlation between the Seymour Chatman's textual types and the fiction theory nomenclature, and last but not least the thesis deals with the possibilities of this theory in the <b>fictional</b> <b>worlds</b> of lyrical poetry.

40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{distinction}} between fiction and reality in the film using the theory of <b>fictional</b> <b>worlds.</b> It analyzes the effect of <b>fictional</b> <b>worlds</b> and their characters on the viewer's perception and interpretation of fiction. It emphasizes the difference {{of the impact of}} fiction on reality, depending on whether the recipient evaluates the fictional work by its relation to reality or realizes that the film doesn't refer to the actual world. The thesis describes the main concepts and problems of the theory of <b>fictional</b> <b>worlds</b> and applies them to the examples of films to show the importance of distinguishing the line between fiction and reality...|$|R
40|$|The growing {{accessibility}} {{of quantum mechanics}} and chaos theory over the past eighty years has opened a new mode of world-creating for dramatists. An increasingly large collection of plays organize their <b>fictional</b> <b>worlds</b> around such scientific concepts as quantum uncertainty and chaotic determinism. This trend is especially noticeable within dramatic texts that emphasize a fictional, not material or metafictional, engagement. These plays construct <b>fictional</b> <b>worlds</b> that reflect the increasingly strange actual world. The dominant theoretical approaches to <b>fictional</b> <b>worlds</b> unfairly treat these plays as primarily metafictional texts, when these texts construct fictional experiences to speculate about everyday ramifications {{of living in a}} post-quantum mechanics world. This thesis argues that these texts are best understood as examples of speculative fiction drama, and they speculate about the changes to our understanding of reality implied by contemporary scientific discoveries. Looking at three plays as exemplary case studies—John Mighton’s Possible Worlds (1990), Tom Stoppard’s Arcadia (1993), and Tony Kushner’s Homebody/Kabul (2001) —this thesis demonstrates that speculative fiction theories can be adapted into <b>fictional</b> <b>worlds</b> analysis, allowing us to analyze these plays as fiction-making texts that offer nonclassical aesthetic experiences. In doing so, this thesis contributes to speculative fiction studies, <b>fictional</b> <b>worlds</b> studies, and the dynamic interdisciplinary dialogue between aesthetic and scientific discourses...|$|R

5|$|Final Fantasy {{has four}} basic game modes: an overworld map, town and dungeon maps, a battle screen, and a menu screen. The overworld map is a {{scaled-down}} {{version of the}} game's <b>fictional</b> <b>world,</b> which the player uses to direct characters to various locations. The primary means of travel across the overworld is by foot; a canoe, a ship, and an airship become available as the player progresses. With the exception of some battles in preset locations or with bosses, enemies are randomly encountered on field maps and on the overworld map when traveling by foot, canoe, or ship, and must either be fought or fled from.|$|E
5|$|Like {{previous}} installments in the Tales series, Tales of Symphonia consists {{primarily of}} three major areas: an overworld field map, town and dungeon maps, and a battle screen. The overworld map is a 3D model, featuring a scaled-down {{version of the}} game's <b>fictional</b> <b>world</b> which the player travels through to reach the game's locations. As with preceding games in the series, the world map can be traversed by foot, on the party's quadrupedal pet Noishe, and on flying vehicles known as Rheairds. On field maps, characters are directed across realistically scaled environments. The battle screen is a 3D representation of an area, in which the player commands the characters in battles against CPU-controlled enemies.|$|E

5|$|Real-world {{historical}} {{designs were}} also adapted for the <b>fictional</b> <b>world.</b> Flying battleships of the Anatoray and Disith nations included components of Japanese dreadnoughts in commission {{at the turn}} of the twentieth century. Uniform designs for Anatoray's musketeers were based on Napoleon Bonaparte's army and American Civil War soldiers. On the other hand, Soviet Red Army fur coats provided the basis for Disith uniforms. Another inspiration for creators came from a silent film of the airship Hindenburg, which depicted the aircraft's UFO-like silver-plated design in contrast to the traditional buildings below. This imagery was reproduced in the series.|$|E

5|$|The Mana {{series is}} the result of Koichi Ishii's desire to create a <b>fictional</b> <b>world.</b> In Ishii's opinion, Mana is not a series of video games, but rather a world which is {{illustrated}} by and can be explored through video games. When working on the series, Koichi Ishii draws inspiration from abstract images from his memories of childhood, as well as movies and fantasy books that captivated him as a child. Ishii takes care to avoid set conventions, and his influences are correspondingly very wide and non-specific. Nonetheless, among his literary influences, he acknowledges Tove Jansson's Moomin, Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, and J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings.|$|E
