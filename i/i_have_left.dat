And this is one reason why I desired you would not ascribe 'innate gravity' to me. That gravity should be innate, inherent, and essential to matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance, through a vacuum, without {{the mediation of}} anything else, by and through which their action and force may be conveyed from one to another, is to me so great an absurdity, that I believe no man who has in philosophical matters a competent faculty of thinking can ever fall into it. Gravity must be caused by an agent acting constantly according to certain laws; but whether this agent be material or immaterial, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> to the consideration of my readers.|$|E

Near {{the end of}} the first season, Faust announced that she had left the series, and for the second season, she stepped down as executive producer, to become consulting producer.

Despite her decreased participation, she still has high hopes for the staff members, stating that [...] "the gaps <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> are being filled by the same amazing artists, writers, and directors who brought you Season1. I'm certain the show will be as entertaining as ever". In addition, a new storyboard editor named Jim Miller was hired for the second season and a majority of the animation was [...] "outsourced" [...] to animation company Top Draw. According to Thiessen, this allowed for a greater pre-production process for season two episodes.|$|E

[...] "I Want to Kill You Like They Do in the Movies" [...] is a primarily bass-driven rock song. At over 9 minutes, it is longest {{song on the}} album.

[...] It {{was one of the}} first tracks the band recorded for The High End of Low, and was originally 25 minutes long. Reluctant to release a double album, they re-recorded a shorter version following the completion of the album's final song, [...] "15", with Manson asking the band: [...] "How many minutes do <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> on this CD ? And it was 9 minutes. I said, 'Roll it, I'm going to sing it.' What appears on the record is one [...] performance." ...|$|E
500|$|After the {{airing of}} the first season's finale, Faust {{announced}} that {{she had left the}} show, and would be credited in the future as Consulting Producer.

I'm certain the show will be as entertaining as ever". In an interview with New York Magazine, Faust stated her reasons for leaving were a combination of a hectic production schedules and a lack of creative control she had with the series. According to her husband McCracken, Faust's departure was {{due to the fact that}} as a toy company-driven show, [...] "there were things she wanted to do with that series that she just wasn't able to do", and that there is [...] "still some frustration with" [...] not being able to bring some of her ideas to screen.|$|E
500|$|When {{beginning}} {{work on her}} then-untitled third studio album, Stefani sought {{inspiration from}} her personal life in order to write lyrics for new material. She noted:... I was also in a really desperate place doing This Is What The Truth Feels Like, and I wasn’t back {{to a place of}} naiveté and purity. It was, 'All <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> right now is my music. And if I do that, maybe I’ll survive.' So, the way Tragic Kingdom was pure, this new record was pure. I was making this record because it’s all I could do to save my own life. She described this as a magical process. Immediately following the completion of [...] "Make Me Like You", Stefani wrote [...] "Misery" [...] with Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels, Mattias Larsson, and Robin Frediksson; however, unlike the recording sessions for her previous albums, the songwriting process was significantly shorter, which she opined was because everything should be simple. [...] "Misery" [...] was recorded by Mattias Larsson and Robin Frediksson of Mattman & Robin at Wolf Cousins Studios and Maratone Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, and at Interscope Studios in Santa Monica, California. Additional recording was handled by Juan Carlos Torrado and Noah Passovoy, while Serban Ghenea mixed the audio at Mixstar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia.|$|E

[...] Romney garnered 206 electoral college votes to Obama's 332, losing {{all but one of}} nine battleground states, and 47percent of the nationwide popular vote to Obama's 51percent. Media accounts described Romney as [...] "shellshocked" [...] by the result. He and his senior campaign staff had disbelieved public polls showing Obama narrowly ahead, and had {{thought they were going to}} win until the vote tallies began to be reported on the evening of the election. [...] But Romney's get out the vote operation had been inferior to Obama's, both in person-to-person organization and in voter modeling and outreach technology (the latter exemplified by the failure of the Project Orca application). In his concession speech to his supporters, he said, [...] "Like so many of you, Paul and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> everything on the field. We have given our all to this campaign. I so wish that I had been able to fulfill your hopes to lead this country in a different direction, but the nation chose another leader." [...] Reflecting on his defeat during a conference call to hundreds of fundraisers and donors a week after the election, Romney attributed the outcome to Obama's having secured the votes of specific interest groups, including African Americans, Hispanic Americans, young people, and women, by offering them what Romney called [...] "extraordinary financial gifts." [...] The remark drew heavy criticism from prominent members of the Republican party.|$|E

2500|$|Mullaney {{made his}} {{first-class}}, listA, and Twenty20 debuts for Lancashire in 2006. His first team cricket with Lancashire in 2006–2009 was limited, {{and in that}} time he played 4first-class matches, 7listA matches, and three Twenty20 matches. In April 2007, Mullaney scored his maiden first-class century. Playing against Durham University, his innings of 165not out (165*) came at quicker than a run a ball and allowed Lancashire to win the match. His first hundred runs came off 92balls and the next 65 from 26 and included 10sixes. It beat his previous highest score of 44. In the 2007 cricket season, Mullaney played for Northern Cricket Club, in the Liverpool and District Cricket Competition, averaging 70 with the bat and taking over 30wickets. After he spent the winter of 2007/08 playing grade cricket for McKinnon in the Victorian Turf Cricket Association, Mullaney signed a professional contract with Atherton Cricket Club in the Bolton Association {{at the start of the}} 2008 season.

2500|$|As to the radula of this species, it is a {{very small}} and rather obscure object, and only by teasing it to pieces, I could get an idea of the shape of the teeth. The uncini quite cover the median rows, and cross even the uncini of the {{opposite}} side. The rhachidian or median tooth has a subquadrate basal part, with rounded, convex posterior and less convex lateral margins. It has a broad, triangular cusp, with one small median denticle and about 6 smaller ones on each side. The laterals one on each side, have a transversely triangular shape, with an unarmed, arched upper and concave proximal and basal margin, with blunt points at the proximal and distal extremities of the basal margin. On each side I see at least 3, but I suppose there are 4 uncini which are long, slender and strongly curved. Though this radula has some resemblance with that of Aporrhais, like Verrill (Mollusca of the New England coast. Transact. Connecticut Acad, of arts and sciences, Vol. VI, May 1884, p. 1S6 and 188) has stated, and like his figure (I.e. pi. 31, fig. 14b) affirms, I cannot agree without doubt with his view that it should be taenioglossate, as the [...] "Siboga"-specimen has a radula with at least 9 rows of teeth and probably 11. The nacreous character of the shell agrees with the Rhipidoglossa, and so does the larger number of uncini. I should think the genus will belong to the Rhipidoglossa with a restricted number of teeth, such as Basilissa. As however only a knowledge of other anatomical particulars, the position and structure of the gills, of the heart etc. can decide the question <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> the family near Trichotropis in accordance with the newest systematic arrangement of Paul Pelseneer (A treatise on Zoology, edited by Ray Lankester, Part V, Mollusca, 1906, p.156) ...|$|E
