5|$|The Mono–Inyo {{chain of}} craters lies in east-central California, roughly {{parallel}} to the eastern escarpment of the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Volcanism and seismic activity in eastern California {{are a result of}} two major geologic processes: northwest movement of the Pacific Plate with respect to the North American Plate along the San Andreas Fault system near the coast, and east–west extension of the crust that formed the Basin and Range Province. In the Long Valley region, where the craters are located, basin and range extension <b>encroaches</b> onto the thick and stable crust of the Sierra Nevada.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Lincoln, the QEW travels {{along the}} Lake Ontario {{shoreline}} through the Niagara Fruit Belt; numerous wineries line {{the south side}} of the freeway. Interchanges at Victoria Road (Regional Road24) and Ontario Street (Regional Road18) provide access to the communities of Vineland and Beamsville, respectively. The latter <b>encroaches</b> upon {{the south side of}} the QEW, interrupting the otherwise agricultural surroundings of the highway in Lincoln. Immediately east of the Bartlett Avenue interchange, the freeway enters Grimsby, where it becomes sandwiched between the Niagara Escarpment and Lake Ontario. The route passes under three overpasses that have remained unchanged since the highway was built: Maple Avenue, Ontario Street and Christie Street, all served by a single diamond interchange. South of the 50Point Conservation Area, the freeway exits Niagara Region and enters the city of Hamilton.|$|E
40|$|Bush {{encroachment}} is {{the conversion}} of open savannas to tree-dominated shrub lands. Bush encroachment results in habitat degradation {{and the loss of}} resource productivity. In this study, small mammals were used to investigate the effects of bush encroachment on biodiversity. The main aim {{of this study was to}} assess the effects of bush encroachment on the species abundance, diversity and composition of small mammals. The study was conducted in selected bush <b>encroached</b> and non-bush <b>encroached</b> sites at the Neudamm Agricultural Farm in the Khomas Region, during the “Hot-dry ” season, “Hot-wet ” season (April 2010) and “Cold-dry ” season (July 2010). Various habitat factors, namely: woody density, woody cover and grass cover, all of which influence the diversity, distribution and abundance of small mammals were measured in the bush <b>encroached</b> and non-bush <b>encroached</b> sites. An area was considered to be bush <b>encroached</b> when the woody density of the <b>encroaching</b> species was> 1, 000 bushes per 1 ha. Non-bush <b>encroached</b> sites were areas with a woody density of < 1, 000 bushes per 1 ha. The results revealed a significant difference in the woody density (t 49 = 5. 77; n = 50, p < 0. 001), woody cover (H 7 = 15. 27, n = 8, p <...|$|R

25|$|In most Persian rugs, {{the field}} of the rug is {{surrounded}} by stripes, or borders. These may number from one up to over ten, but usually there is one wider main border surrounded by minor, or guardian borders. The main border is often filled with complex and elaborate rectilinear or curvilinear designs. The minor border stripes show simpler designs like meandering vines. The traditional Persian border arrangement was highly conserved through time, but can also be modified {{to the effect that}} the field <b>encroaches</b> on the main border. This feature is often seen in Kerman rugs from the late nineteenth century, and was likely taken over from French Aubusson or Savonnerie weaving designs.|$|E
25|$|In principle, the Life {{field is}} infinite, but {{computers}} have finite memory. This leads to problems when the active area <b>encroaches</b> {{on the border}} of the array. Programmers have used several strategies to address these problems. The simplest strategy is simply to assume that every cell outside the array is dead. This is easy to program, but leads to inaccurate results when the active area crosses the boundary. A more sophisticated trick is to consider the left and right edges of the field to be stitched together, and the top and bottom edges also, yielding a toroidal array. The result is that active areas that move across a field edge reappear at the opposite edge. Inaccuracy can still result if the pattern grows too large, but at least there are no pathological edge effects. Techniques of dynamic storage allocation may also be used, creating ever-larger arrays to hold growing patterns.|$|E
40|$|Background {{and aims}} Intensive land use {{has led to}} {{degradation}} and abandonment of Portuguese oak woodlands, and subsequent shrub encroachment may have altered the spatial heterogeneity of soil C and N pools. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effects of shrub invasion on soil C and N dynamics in an oak woodland in Southern Portugal. Methods Soil was sampled beneath and outside scattered Quercus suber L. canopies, considering non <b>encroached</b> areas and areas <b>encroached</b> by shrubs (Cistus ladanifer L. or Cistus salviifolius L.). Results The spatial heterogeneity of soil C and N contents was mainly associated with tree presence. Outside tree canopies, the labile C pools were larger (mainly beneath C. ladanifer) and C cycling was faster in <b>encroached</b> areas than in non <b>encroached</b> areas. Net and gross N mineralization and urease and protease activities were also higher in <b>encroached</b> than in non <b>encroached</b> areas; however, the metabolic quotient and the Cmicrobial/Corganic ratio were not significantly affected. Beneath the tree canopy, significant effects of encroachment included a small increase in soil labile C and the enzymatic activity beneath C. ladanifer. Conclusions The results indicate the potential capacity of shrub encroachment to accumulate soil organic C in the long term. The rate of soil C and N turnover promoted by shrub encroachment may depend on the Cistus species present...|$|R

At the next performance, after Helena and her mother have a heated argument, Helena's mother collapses and is taken to the hospital. Ten days later, while Helena is staying with her grandmother, she finds that the doctors {{determine}} that Helena's mother requires an operation, and Helena can only blame herself for the situation. That night, she wakes up in a dream-like state and leaves her building to find three performers outside. As they try to perform for Helena, a shadow <b>encroaches</b> on the area {{and two of the}} performers are consumed by it. The third performer, Valentine (Jason Barry), a juggler, helps to quickly direct Helena to safety through the use of magical flying books. She learns they are in the City of Light which is slowly being consumed by shadows, causing its widely varied citizens to flee. Soon Helena is mistaken for the Princess. She and Valentine are taken to the Prime Minister (Brydon). He explains that the Princess from the Land of Shadow stole a charm from the City of Light, leaving their White Queen (McKee) in a state of unnatural sleep and the City vulnerable to the Shadows. Helena notes the resemblance of the Queen and Minister to her mother and father, and offers to help recover the charm along with Valentine. They are unaware their actions are being watched by the Queen of Shadows (also McKee) who has mistaken Helena as the Princess of the Land of Shadows.|$|E

500|$|It is {{possible}} that Congress would have to approve the NPVIC before it could go into effect. Article I, Section 10 of the US Constitution states that: [...] "No State shall, without the Consent of Congress ... enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State, or with a foreign Power." [...] However, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled in Virginia v. Tennessee, , and in several more recent cases, that such consent is not necessary except where a compact <b>encroaches</b> on federal supremacy. Every Vote Equal argues that the compact could never encroach upon federal power since the Constitution explicitly gives the power of casting electoral votes to the states, not the federal government. Derek Muller argues that the NPVIC would nonetheless affect the federal system {{in such a way}} that it would require Congressional approval, while Ian Drake argues that Congress is actually prohibited under the Constitution from granting approval to the NPVIC. NPVIC supporters dispute this conclusion and state they plan to seek congressional approval if the compact is approved by a sufficient number of states.|$|E
500|$|With the {{exception}} of the tower and spire, much of the church was rebuilt in the Decorated Gothic style during the late 14th century. The nave and aisles extend eastwards from the tower. Outside, parts of the aisles are highly decorated; the north doorway includes shafts, mouldings and finials, while the simpler south doorway has niches and monster carvings. The northern doorway has a gable which <b>encroaches</b> up into a five-light window. Pevsner remarks that St Denys' is particularly notable for its tracery, and the building's entry on the Statutory List of Buildings of Special Architectural or Historic Interest notes [...] "particularly good mid [...] tracery and ornament". The window above the north doorway is a good example; it contains elements shared by others of the Decorated style around the church, including reticulated ogee arches of varying complexity. A Perpendicular clerestory adorns the aisles with three-light windows; it dates to the early 15th century, possibly c. 1430. The north aisle was extended in 1853, but the architects, Kirk and Parry, reused the windows. The north transept includes a six-light window—"one of the great flowing designs of the country", according to Pevsner. Simon Jenkins, in his 2012 England's Thousand Best Churches, awards St Denys three stars and says of the window tracery: [...] "This is Lincolnshire at its most curvaceous, best displayed in the north transept north window. Words can barely do justice to this work... This is a work of infinite complexity, with variations repeated throughout the church." ...|$|E
