The phone implements Data Bridging functionality so that a single <b>data</b> <b>switch</b> port from a <b>data</b> <b>switch</b> in the closet can support both voice and data services which is a significant savings over separate hard wired TDM connections for voice and data.|$|R

50|$|The cables for {{connecting}} equipment together have a {{male plug}} at each end. Some of the wires such as ground, <b>data,</b> <b>switching</b> and RGB {{connect to the}} identical pin number at each end. Others such as audio and video are swapped so that an output signal {{at one end of}} the cable connects to an input signal at the other end. The complete list of wires that are swapped is: pins 1 and 2, pins 3 and 6, pins 17 and 18, pins 19 and 20.|$|E

50|$|Datagrams are {{formatted}} {{according to}} schedules {{that depend on}} Quality of service and availability of switching nodes and physical links. Respect to Circuit switching the added time dimension introduces additional complexity to network management. Like Circuit switching, TDS operates without buffers and header processing according to the pipeline forwarding principle; therefore an all optical implementation with Optical fibers and Optical Switches is possible with low cost. The TDS concept itself pervades and is applicable with advantage to existing <b>data</b> <b>switching</b> technologies, including Packet switching, where packets, or sets of packets become the datagrams that are routed through the network.|$|E
5000|$|Cerent's {{first product}} was the Cerent 454 (later the Cisco 15454). The Cerent 454 {{was a second}} {{generation}} SONET ADM (Add-Drop Multiplexor) that also supported TCP/IP <b>data</b> <b>switching.</b> When operating as a pure ADM, the 454 could add and drop circuits from OC-192 down to Digital Signal 1 (DS1) -- later it would support Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM). Unlike the ADMs that preceded it, a transport signal {{did not have to}} be terminated outside the box to switch or route the TCP/IP packets. [...] "Data cards" [...] could be inserted into the chassis which would terminate the circuits then switch or route the packets between those terminated circuits. This capability meant carriers no longer had to purchase two boxes (e.g. an ADM and a router) just to move TCP/IP packets around its telecom network.|$|E
5000|$|With severe memory {{constraints}} and real time use, keeping {{only a single}} copy of code loaded into core was a requirement. Since the 1108 was designed for multitasking, the system was fully [...] "reentrant" [...] (thread safe). Each reentrant module accessed program data through a single memory [...] "base address", which was different for each instance of run <b>data.</b> <b>Switching</b> execution contexts {{could be done in}} a single instruction merely by setting a different base address in a single register. The system used fine-grained locking to protect shared data structures. The executive, compilers, utilities, and even sophisticated user applications that might have multiple copies running concurrently were written so that their code could be shared. This required loading only one copy into memory, saving both space and the time it took to load the code.|$|E
50|$|Server Technology {{was founded}} in 1984, and by 1987 had grown large enough to acquire CrossPoint Systems, a {{manufacturer}} of PC <b>data</b> <b>switches.</b> In 1990, Server Technology introduced its first power and network control products.|$|R
50|$|The use {{of optical}} fiber offers much higher data rates over {{relatively}} longer distances. Most high-capacity Internet and cable television backbones already use fiber optic technology, with <b>data</b> <b>switched</b> to other technologies (DSL, cable, POTS) for final delivery to customers.|$|R
50|$|The use of <b>data</b> <b>switches</b> in the <b>data</b> {{flow graph}} could {{to some extent}} make a static data flow graph appear as dynamic, and blur the {{distinction}} slightly.

The job scope is in-charge of around 320 executives, 7000 TM members and 5000 TM contractor members.

30|$|Other {{possible}} PHY optimizations are preamble and <b>data</b> <b>switching.</b> They are {{explained in}} detail in [22]. In short, preamble switching occurs when a new frame arrives {{at the time that}} the receiver node is still receiving the preamble and physical layer convergence procedure (PCLP) header of an earlier frame. The new frame can be picked and locked onto by the receiver node if it has sufficiently higher power to be heard above the earlier one. <b>Data</b> <b>switching</b> refers to the capture of a new incoming frame during the frame body reception process of another one. The result of applying these techniques on top of SDDV level 7 is depicted in part (c) of Figure 13. It can be observed that in the CAM PSR plot, a darker red area has appeared around the diagonal. This means that the CAM PSR for a node’s most direct neighbors has reached very high values. This is a desirable VANET communication characteristic. Therefore, we define the adoption of preamble and <b>data</b> <b>switching</b> as the last key characteristic of SDDV (level 8).|$|E

To that end, the Markov modulated ON-OFF model has been frequently incorporated as a building block for constructing more complex traffic scenarios. Multimedia traffic...|$|E

A three-level layered interconnection network is designed for the intra- and intercell communications. A serial peripheral interface (SPI) is designed as {{an efficient way to}} load/reconfigure instruction codes into active cell units.

30|$|This paper {{focused on}} the VANET issues {{regarding}} scalable data dissemination. Simulations have illustrated the severity of this problem when adopting common techniques and parameter values. Step by step, optimizations were combined to compose a holistic solution: SDDV. During the selection of each possible technique, consideration was given to its degree of complexity. The final result is a composition of eight techniques: opportunistic forwarding, irresponsible forwarding, fixed transmit power of 33 dBm, fixed transimission rate of 12 Mbps, adoption of the VO QoS class for both CAM and DENM messages, adaptive beaconing based on the vehicle speed, improved channel tracking using decision feedback and smoothing, and preamble and <b>data</b> <b>switching.</b>|$|E

This display, based on ferroelectric liquid-crystal material, enables us to present 125 training examples/s to the LNN. To maximize the optical feedback efficiency of the setup, a loop mirror is introduced.
