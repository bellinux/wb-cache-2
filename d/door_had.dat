5|$|Although {{the door}} was unlocked, a thumb screw inside {{apparently}} {{made it difficult for}} a child to open. The <b>door</b> <b>had</b> a knob on the outside, but only a small turn latch on the inside.|$|E
5|$|A bronze-covered door, {{with relief}} panels {{depicting}} figures, opens onto the entrance hall. In Burges's time the <b>door</b> <b>had</b> a letterbox, {{in the form}} of Mercury, the messenger of the gods. The letterbox is now lost, but a contemporary copy is in the collection of The Higgins Art Gallery & Museum. The porch contains a white marble seat and column, and on the floor is a mosaic of Pinkie, a favourite poodle of Burges. Cartooned by H.W. Lonsdale, it resembles the cave canem floor at Pompei.|$|E
5|$|A service ramp at {{the rear}} of the {{basement}} led to a sliding door that opened into an alley; the police found the <b>door</b> <b>had</b> been tampered with so it could be opened without unlocking it. Later examination found bloody fingerprints on the door, as well as a metal pipe that had been used as a crowbar. Some evidence at the crime scene was improperly handled by the police investigators: a trail in the dirt (from the elevator shaft) along which police believed Phagan had been dragged was trampled; the footprints were never identified.|$|E

5|$|Williamson's {{body was}} {{discovered}} by Chambers at approximately 11.15am. Chambers noticed that the air conditioning had been left on, something that Williamson was unlikely to have done, and then realised that Williamson's bedroom <b>door</b> <b>had</b> been left ajar. Investigating further, {{he opened the door}} and discovered Williamson's corpse lying face down on the floor, with multiple stab wounds to the neck and surrounded by a pool of blood. Williamson's dog, Tessa, was running about in the room and barking.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{inconsistencies}} {{was whether}} the McCanns had entered the apartment by the front or back door when checking on the children. According to the Polícia Judiciária case file, Gerry stated during his first interview, on 4 May 2007, that the couple had entered 5A through the locked front door for his 21:05 and her 22:00 checks, and in a second interview, on 10 May, that he had entered through the unlocked patio doors at the back. (The patio doors could be unlocked only from inside, so the parents had left them unlocked to let themselves in.) There was also an inconsistency about whether the front <b>door</b> <b>had</b> been locked. Gerry told the Sunday Times in December 2007 that they had used the front door earlier in the week, but it was next to the children's bedroom, so they had started using the patio doors instead.|$|E
5|$|Arson {{investigators}} testified as to {{how they}} had located the origin and cause of the house fire, stressing that the multiple unconnected, small fires they had found in the home's basement were evidence of the fire having been set purposely and that char patterns on the house's floors were evidence of a liquid accelerant having been used to start the fire. The living room floor had contained the most significant amount of accelerant, and the trail of accelerant had ended {{at the door of the}} master bedroom, which had been open while the fire burned. The state of the bedroom door contradicted Green's prior testimony to investigators that her bedroom <b>door</b> <b>had</b> been closed and she had only opened it briefly to look into the hallway.|$|E

25|$|On Sunday, June 24, five text {{messages}} {{were sent to}} co-workers between 3:51a.m. and 3:58a.m. using both Chris Benoit's and Nancy Benoit's cell phones. Four of them were the Benoits' address; the fifth said that the family's dogs were in the enclosed pool area, and also noted that a garage side <b>door</b> <b>had</b> been left open. Guerrero and Scott Armstrong {{were two of the}} recipients of these texts.|$|E
25|$|After {{their return}} from Varennes {{and until the}} {{storming}} of the Tuileries on 10 August 1792, the queen, her family and entourage were held under tight surveillance by the Garde nationale in the Tuileries, where the royal couple was guarded night and day. Four guards accompanied the queen wherever she went, and her bedroom <b>door</b> <b>had</b> to be left open at night. Her health also began to deteriorate, thus further reducing her physical activities.|$|E
25|$|On 14 May 1989, in the type's second fatal accident, Lynx HAS3GM XZ244, {{attached}} to , crashed near Mombasa, Kenya, while {{en route to}} the city's airport for a period of shore leave. A <b>door</b> <b>had</b> detached when opened inflight and collided with the tail rotor, resulting in the aircraft splitting in half and the death of all nine personnel on board. As a result, door modifications and inflight opening restrictions were introduced. As of 2004, it remained the deadliest Lynx crash.|$|E

25|$|Victoria Hall {{was a large}} {{concert hall}} on Toward Road facing Mowbray Park. The hall {{was the scene of}} a tragedy on 16 June 1883 when 183 {{children}} died. During a variety show, children rushed towards a staircase for treats. At the bottom of the staircase, the <b>door</b> <b>had</b> been opened inward and bolted {{in such a way as}} to leave only a gap wide enough for one child to pass at a time. The children surged down the stairs and those at the front were trapped and crushed by the weight of the crowd behind them.|$|E
25|$|They {{looked at}} the case as a murder, with the {{burglary}} staged to throw the police off the trail. Many aspects of the crime were improbable for a break-in, especially one committed in daylight: Rasmussen's jewelry box, an inviting target for a burglar, was in plain view atop her dresser and had not been touched. The condo {{was in the middle}} of a gated complex, surrounded by other units from which burglars could have expected to be easily observed. The front <b>door</b> <b>had</b> an alarm warning, and had not been forced open, as it might have been if the putative burglars had not expected anyone to be at home.|$|E
25|$|As {{there was}} a risk of fire from the leaking fuel, the {{commander}} ordered an emergency evacuation of the aircraft. Although the rear doors opened as intended and the evacuation slides deployed, both forward doors required considerable force to open them before all on board could evacuate the aircraft. No injuries were sustained in the evacuation. The investigation subsequently was able to replicate the difficulty in opening both forward doors on the One-Eleven. It was discovered that inadequate guidance from the manufacturer of the escape slides meant that they were incorrectly stowed. One <b>door</b> <b>had</b> an incorrect part fitted. A warning was issued to all One-Eleven operators and the relevant aviation authorities concerning this issue.|$|E

25|$|Witnesses saw Moseley {{enter his}} car, drive away and return ten minutes later. Shadowing {{his face with}} a wide-brimmed hat, he {{systematically}} searched the parking lot, the train station and an apartment complex, eventually finding Genovese, who was barely conscious and lying in a hallway {{at the back of the}} building, where a locked <b>door</b> <b>had</b> prevented her from going inside. Out of view of the street and of those who may have heard or seen any sign of the initial attack, Moseley stabbed Genovese several more times before raping her, stealing $49 from her and running away again. The attacks spanned approximately half an hour, and knife wounds in Genovese's hands suggested that she attempted to defend herself from him. A neighbor, Sophia Farrar, found her shortly after and held her in her arms.|$|E
25|$|Charles Cortimiglia was an {{immigrant}} {{who lived with}} his wife and baby on the corner of Jefferson Avenue and Second Street in Gretna, Louisiana, a New Orleans suburb, across the Mississippi River. On the night of March 10, 1919, screams were heard coming from the Cortimiglia Residence. Grocer Iorlando Jordano rushed across the street to investigate. Upon his arrival, Jordano noticed that Charles Cortimiglia, his wife Rosie, and their infant daughter, Mary, had all been attacked by the unknown intruder. Rosie stood in the doorway with a serious head wound, clutching her deceased daughter. Charles laid on the floor, bleeding profusely. The couple was rushed to Charity Hospital, where it was discovered that both had suffered skull fractures. Nothing was stolen from the house, but a panel on the back <b>door</b> <b>had</b> been chiseled away. A bloody axe was found on the back porch of the home. Charles was released two days later, while his wife remained in the care of doctors. Upon gaining full consciousness, Rosie made claims that Iorlando Jordano and his 18-year-old son, Frank, were responsible for the attacks. Iorlando, a 69-year-old man, was in too poor of health to have committed the crimes. Frank Jordano, more than six feet tall and weighing over 200 pounds, would have been too large to have fit through the panel on the back door. Charles Cortimiglia vehemently denied his wife's claims, yet police nonetheless arrested the two, and charged them with the murder. The men would later be found guilty. Frank was sentenced to hang, and his father to life in prison. Charles Cortimiglia divorced his wife after the trial. Almost a year later, Rosie announced that she had falsely accused the two out of jealousy and spite. Her statement was the only evidence against the Jordanos, and they were released from jail shortly thereafter.|$|E
500|$|The old village church {{from the}} 14th century {{is now known}} as The Sand-Covered Church as only its tower can still be seen. [...] Sand began {{drifting}} in from Råbjerg Mile around 1600, the area surrounding the church becoming affected by the desertification which destroyed the fields. In 1775, the church <b>door</b> <b>had</b> to be dug free for the congregation to be able to attend the service, and for the following 20 years, the Skageners struggled to keep the church free from sand, without being allowed to close it down. In 1795 the church was closed by royal decree and the body of the church demolished.|$|E

500|$|The police entered around 7:54am with a {{sledgehammer}} {{through the back}} door. The <b>door</b> <b>had</b> been locked from the inside, with the key still in the lock. They found five bodies with multiple gunshot wounds, Nevill downstairs {{in the kitchen and}} the rest upstairs. Twenty-five shots had been fired, mostly at close range. In what order the family was killed is not known. A telephone was lying on one of the kitchen surfaces with its receiver off the hook, next to several [...]22 shells. The police said chairs and stools were overturned, and there was broken crockery, a broken sugar basin, and what looked like blood on the floor. A ceiling light lampshade had been broken.|$|E
500|$|From {{the day of}} {{sentencing}} to death, {{prisoners were}} kept in a concrete-floored cell in New Division. They were vigilantly observed to prevent them escaping their sentence through suicide. With hangings taking place on Monday mornings, at 8:00am, condemned prisoners were woken three hours earlier, and provided with a last meal, shower, and clean clothes. Afterwards, handcuffed, they were moved to a holding or [...] "condemned cell" [...] nearby the gallows, and allowed a couple of sips of brandy to calm their nerves. Shortly before 8:00am, they were hooded, {{led up to the}} execution chamber, which could hold as many as eleven witnesses, stood over the trap <b>door,</b> <b>had</b> a noose put around their neck, and were hanged by dropping through the opening trap door. After medical examination, the deceased was removed for burial.|$|E
