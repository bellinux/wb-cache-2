50|$|The name pulegioides {{is derived}} from the Latin pulegium and oides, and means “like pennyroyal,” in {{reference}} to <b>European</b> <b>pennyroyal</b> (Mentha pelugium). The name pelugium was given to <b>European</b> <b>pennyroyal</b> by Pliny the Elder in the first century CE, for its use in repelling pulex or pulices (Latin for fleas) by spreading it on floors.|$|E
5000|$|Mentha pulegium, {{commonly}} (<b>European)</b> <b>pennyroyal,</b> or pennyrile, {{also called}} squaw mint, mosquito plant and pudding grass, is {{a species of}} flowering plant in the Lamiaceae family, or mint family, native to Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. [...] Crushed pennyroyal leaves emits a very strong fragrance similar to spearmint. Pennyroyal is a traditional folk remedy, emmenagogue, abortifacient, and culinary herb. <b>European</b> <b>pennyroyal</b> is related to an American species, Hedeoma pulegioides. Though they differ in genera, they share similar chemical properties.|$|E
40|$|<b>European</b> <b>pennyroyal</b> (Mentha pulegium L.) is {{the best}} source of {{essential}} oils and natural antioxidants. The main component of the essential oil is pulegone, {{which can be a}} precursor for the synthesis of menthol and menthofuran. The aim of this research is to develop technology in vitro cultivation of <b>European</b> <b>pennyroyal</b> (Mentha pulegium L.) to increase the essential oil content. In this research we used the various varieties and the primary explants obtained from plantlets for the induction of callus formation and somatic organogenesis in <b>European</b> <b>pennyroyal</b> plants varieties Pennyroyal and Sonia. Best response for seeds sterilization was got by using the sodium hypochlorite for 10 - 15 minutes. Murashige and Skoog basal medium was used for induction of morphogenesis. Using the lamina explants of Pennyroyal stem organogenesis was obtained in one modification of the ½ MS medium supplemented by 0. 5 mg/l kinetin + 1 mg/l NAA - and amounted to 20 %. In the variety Sonia stem organogenesis was not received on any medium modification. Petioles as explants gave no stem organogenesis on any medium modification. Nodes as explants showed stem organogenesis on all medium modifications, its effectiveness ranged between 60 % and 100 %. In the variety Sonia stem organogenesis had frequency from 33 % to 100 % on most medium modifications. When we used internodes explants of both varieties stem organogenesis was obtained only on MS medium supplemented by 0. 5 mg/l BAP + 1 mg/l NAA, and amounted to 20 %. For the induction of root organogenesis we can recommend a medium with half mineral content on MS medium supplemented by kinetin as cytokinin and NAA as auxin. Regenerates of the variety Pennyroyal developed visually better than ones of the variety Sonia. Thus for the variety Pennyroyal we can recommend MS as the mineral basic, and for the variety Sonia - ½ MS. </p...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} of industry to replace synthetic chemicals by natural products with bioactive properties from plant origin. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the chemical composition of <b>European</b> <b>pennyroyal</b> (Mentha pulegium) essential oil and to characterize the in vitro antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of its water (hot and cold) and ethanolic extracts and of the essential oil. The essential oil revealed menthone, pulegone and neo-menthol as the main constituents, comprising 35. 9, 23. 2 and 9. 2 % of the essential oil, respectively. The hot water extract exhibited the highest antioxidant activity and phenol content. In contrast, the extracts were not very effective to inhibit the growth of the seven foodborne spoilage and pathogenic bacteria tested, but the essential oil showed antibacterial activity against all bacterial strains. In conclusion, extracts and essential oil of M. pulegium from Mediterranean origin have huge potential as an alternative to chemical additives for the food industry...|$|E
