5|$|The Rise of Scourge was {{released}} on 24 June 2008 and, unlike the other manga which form trilogies, is a standalone volume.

The book chronicles his story {{up to the point}} when he kills Tigerstar, who once attacked Scourge when he ventured into the forest as a kitten.|$|E

Jack <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> is an adventure game that focuses purely on puzzles and has no combat.

25|$|In photography, {{dynamic range}} is {{measured}} in exposure value (EV) differences (known as stops). An increase of one EV, or 'one stop', represents a doubling {{of the amount of}} light. Conversely, a decrease of one EV represents a halving of the amount of light. Therefore, revealing detail <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkest</b> of shadows requires high exposures, while preserving detail in very bright situations requires very low exposures. Most cameras cannot provide this range of exposure values within a single exposure, due to their low dynamic range.|$|E
25|$|In November 2006, Hirst was {{curator of}} <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkest</b> hour {{there may be}} light, shown at the Serpentine Gallery, London, the first public {{exhibition}} of (a small part of) his own collection. Now known as the 'murderme collection', this significant accumulation of works spans several generations of international artists, from well-known figures such as Francis Bacon, Jeff Koons, Tracey Emin, Richard Prince, and Andy Warhol, to British painters such as John Bellany, John Hoyland, and Gary Hume, and artists in earlier stages of their careers Rachel Howard, David Choe, Ross Minoru Laing, Nicholas Lumb, Tom Ormond, and Dan Baldwin.|$|E
25|$|Current {{evidence}} suggests that the South Tomb was finished before the pyramid. The symbolic king’s inner palace, decorated in blue faience, is much more complete than that of the pyramid. Three chambers of this substructure are decorated in blue faience to imitate reed-mat facades, just like the pyramid. One room is decorated with three finely niche reliefs of the king, one depicting him running the Heb-sed. Importantly, Egyptian builders chose to employ their most skilled artisans and depict their finest art <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkest,</b> most inaccessible place in the complex. This highlights the fact that this impressive craftsmanship was not meant {{for the benefit of the}} living but was meant to ensure the king had all the tools necessary for a successful afterlife.|$|E

50|$|Lost <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> (Italian:Sperduti nel buio) is a 1901 {{play by the}} Italian writer Roberto Bracco.

25|$|In the Warriors universe, {{there are}} four Clans of feral cats that live in a forest: ThunderClan, RiverClan, WindClan, and ShadowClan. Each Clan is adapted to its own types of prey and members usually possess (or are taught) special skills which suit the territory's terrain. The authors based the forest on the New Forest in {{southern}} England. In addition to the New Forest, Loch Lomond, the Scottish Highlands, and the Forest of Dean inspired the fictional locales in the novel. BloodClan {{is a group of}} stray city cats introduced <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Darkest</b> Hour. This group of cats is not considered to be a true Clan because they do not believe in the warriors' spiritual ancestors, StarClan, or the warrior code, a set of rules followed by all Clan cats. BloodClan cats are thus seen as a group of rogues (non-Clan cats who do not respect the Clan cats' rules).|$|E
500|$|At best, Hydrophiinae make {{difficult}} captives. Ditmars (1933) {{described them}} as nervous and delicate captives that usually refuse to eat, preferring only to hide <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkest</b> {{corner of the}} tank. Over 50years later, Mehrtens (1987) wrote, although they were rarely displayed in Western zoological parks, some species were regularly on display in Japanese aquariums. Available food supply limits {{the number of species}} that can be kept in captivity, since some have diets that are too specialized. Also, some species appear intolerant of handling, or even being removed from the water. [...] Regarding their requirements in captivity, the Laticauda species {{need to be able to}} exit the water somewhere [...] at about 29°C, along with a submerged shelter. Species that have done relatively well in captivity include the ringed sea snake, Hydrophis cyanocinctus, which feeds on fish and eels in particular. Pelamis platurus has done especially well in captivity, accepting small fish, including goldfish. However, care has to be taken to house them in round or oval tanks, or in rectangular tanks with corners that are well-rounded, to prevent the snakes from damaging their snouts by swimming into the sides.|$|E

[...] "Life's a Bitch" [...] contains a sample of The Gap Band's hit [...] "Yearning for Your Love" [...] (1980), and has guest vocals from East New York-based rapper AZ. It also features Nas's father, legendary jazz player Olu Dara, playing trumpet as the music fades out. A columnist for OhWord.com wrote that Dara's contribution to the song provides a [...] "beautifully wistful end to a track that feels drenched in the dying rays of a crimson sunset over the city." [...] "The World Is Yours" [...] provides a more optimistic narrative from Nas's viewpoint, as he cites political and spiritual leader Gandhi as an influence in its verse, {{in contrast to the}} previous Scarface references of [...] "N.Y.

50|$|Alone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> was {{supposed}} to be the first part of Infogrames' Call of Cthulhu series, and later of the Virtual Dreams series (the original French cover included the Virtual Dreams logo), but ended up starting its own franchise. The game was followed by five more games <b>in</b> <b>the</b> series: Alone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> 2 (1993), Alone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> 3 (1994), Alone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dark: The New Nightmare (2001), Alone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> (2008) and Alone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dark: Illumination (2015), and inspired two live-action films Alone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> and Alone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> II. It is widely considered to be a forefather of the survival horror game genre, setting the standard for later rival popular survival horror games such as Resident Evil and Silent Hill.|$|R
500|$|Hebel {{lived in}} Karlsruhe until his death, but made {{occasional}} journeys to other regions. His wish {{to become a}} parish priest in Wiesental was never fulfilled, though he wrote an inaugural sermon for a rural parish in 1820. In this sermon he wrote, [...] "to live and die as a pastor in a peaceful country town, among honest people, has always been my sole wish, up to this hour; it was what I wished for in the happiest and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkest</b> moments of my life". Instead, he was [...] "led higher and higher by an invisible hand, ever further away from my modest goals". In 1805 he was offered the Lutheran parish of Freiburg im Breisgau, but he declined it {{at the behest of}} Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden. He was rewarded in 1808 with his appointment as director of the Gymnasium in Karlsruhe. In 1819 he became a prelate of the Lutheran regional church, a leading position that brought with it a seat in the Upper House of the Parliament (Ständeversammlung) of Baden. As a member of parliament he devoted himself mainly to education, the church and social policy. He later gave a speech at the consecration of the statehouse in Karlsruhe. Even though the Lutheran and Reformed regional churches of Baden merged in 1821 with strong support from his side, into today's Evangelische Landeskirche in Baden, his position as the prelate of the unified Protestant church was not endangered.|$|E
