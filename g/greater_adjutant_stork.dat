50|$|A wetland, Mājuli is a hotspot for {{flora and}} fauna, {{harbouring}} many rare and endangered avifauna species including migratory birds that {{arrive in the}} winter season. Among the birds seen here are the <b>greater</b> <b>adjutant</b> <b>stork,</b> pelican, Siberian crane and the whistling teal. After dark wild geese and ducks fly in flocks to distant destinations. The island is almost pollution free owing {{to the lack of}} polluting industries and factories and also the chronic rainfall.|$|E
50|$|The beel is {{a natural}} habitat to many {{varieties}} of birds. 219 species of birds including more than 70 migratory species are reported in the beel area. The largest congregations of aquatic birds can be seen, particularly in winter, with a reported recorded count of 19,000 water birds in a day. Some of the globally threatened species of birds like spotbilled pelican (Pelecanus philippensis), lesser adjutant stork (Leptoptilos javanicus), Baer’s pochard (Aythya baeri), Pallas' sea eagle (Haliaeetus leucogaster), <b>greater</b> <b>adjutant</b> <b>stork</b> (Leptoptilos dubius).Among {{the large number of}} migratory water fowl, the Siberian crane (Grus leucogeranus) regularly migrates to this habitat during its annual journey.

500|$|Aelian {{described}} the bird in 250 AD in his De Natura Animalium as the kila, a large bird from India with a crop {{that looks like}} a leather bag. In Victorian times the <b>greater</b> <b>adjutant</b> was known as the gigantic crane and later as the Asiatic marabou. It was very common in Calcutta during the rainy season and large numbers could be seen at garbage sites and also standing on the top of buildings.

5000|$|In 1888 the Fine Art Society planned an {{exhibition}} on birds and Marks {{decided to use}} this opportunity to take up an intensive study of birds and he became a regular visitor at the zoo. In 1890 he had a private exhibition on his bird works. As his career progressed, he became increasingly interested in painting birds. Possibly his most famous painting is A Select Committee (1891) which {{is now in the}} Walker Art Gallery. He was elected {{as a member of the}} Royal Academy following his painting Convocation, which was exhibited in 1878. Both of these demonstrated his interest in birds, in the former parrots and in the latter <b>adjutant</b> <b>storks</b> and in general his paintings depicted large birds and the colourful parrots and he visited the London Zoo regularly to observe them. His early works were in oil (The Convent Raven, 1870) but many of his paintings of birds were watercolours, which he exhibited at the Old Watercolour Society or at the Fine Art Society. St Francis Preaching to the Birds (1870), was first sold for sold for £450 and seven years later for £1155. His diploma work Science is measurement depicting a scientist with measuring instruments before the skeleton of an <b>adjutant</b> <b>stork</b> is considered a classic. He got the idea of painting this scene while taking measurements for his earlier paintings. [...] "In making studies of the birds, I went to the Museum of the Royal College of Sureons to take measurements of the bones, their proportionate length, &c. When I had obtained what information I needed, I came away, and crossing Lincoln's Inn Fields, it struck me that the occupation in which I had been engaged would furnish a good subjectfor the picture." [...] To paint this picture he asked for advice on obtaining a skeleton of the <b>adjutant</b> <b>stork</b> from Sir William Flower that could be kept at home so that he could study it at leisure. Flower suggested a taxidermy artist and skeleton preparer in Camden Town who supplied him with a suitable specimen. Marks ensured that he counted the vertebrae and measured them carefully to make sure it was accurate. The title was decided after much discussion with artists and scientists and he submitted it as his diploma picture for the Royal Academy of Arts. Abraham Dee Bartlett, superintendent at the London zoo, encouraged him to draw birds with accuracy rather than colour them with anthropomorphism. In later years he painted landscapes and seascapes based on studies in Southwold and Walberswick.|$|R
