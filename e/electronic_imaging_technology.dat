5000|$|The {{history of}} imaging {{technology}} (photography) {{can be said}} to extend back to the times of Chinese philosopher Mo-Ti (470-390 B.C.) who described the principles behind the precursor to the camera obscura. Since that time, advances in imaging technology include the discovery of chemical photographic processes in the 19th century and the use of <b>electronic</b> <b>imaging</b> <b>technology</b> that includes analog video cameras and digital video and still cameras. By the mid 1990s, it was apparent that technologically advanced camera systems such as these were being adopted for use {{in the criminal justice system}}. This led the FBI to convene a meeting of individuals working in the field of forensic imaging from federal, state, local, and foreign law enforcement, and the U.S. military, during the summer of 1997. As a result of this meeting, the Technical Working Group on Imaging Technology was formed from a core group of the meeting’s participants. This group later became the Scientific Working Group on Imaging Technology (SWGIT).Prior to the inception of SWGIT, some law enforcement agencies began adopting digital imaging technology. Due to the lack of guidelines or standards, some of these agencies attempted to replace all their film cameras with substandard digital cameras, only to find that the equipment they had purchased was not capable of accomplishing the mission for which they were intended. At that time only low resolution digital cameras were deemed affordable by some law enforcement agencies. Some of these agencies were forced to rethink their photography procedures and reverted to the use of film cameras or replaced their low-resolution digital cameras with higher quality, more expensive equipment. Also lacking at this early stage was guidance on how to store and archive digital image files. When SWGIT was formed, it was tasked with providing guidance to law enforcement and others in the criminal justice system by releasing documents that describe the best practices and guidelines for the use of imaging technology, to include these concerns and many others. [...] This group was terminated in 2015.|$|E

40|$|The {{advance and}} rapid {{development}} of <b>electronic</b> <b>imaging</b> <b>technology</b> has {{lead the way}} to production of imaging sensors capable of acquiring good quality digital images with a high resolution. At {{the same time the}} cost and size of imaging devices have reduced. This has incited an increasing research interest for techniques that use images obtained by multiple camera arrays. The use of multi-camera arrays is attractive because it allows capturing multi-view images of dynamic scenes, enabling the creation of novel computer vision and computer graphics applications, as well as next generation video and television systems. There are additional challenges when using a multi-camera array, however. Due to inconsistencies in the fabrication process of imaging sensors and filters, multi-camera arrays exhibit inter-camera color response variations. In this work we characterize and compare the response of two digital color cameras, which have a light sensor based on the charge-coupled device (CCD) array architecture. The results of the response characterization process can be used to model the cameras’ responses, which is an important step when constructing a multi-camera array system...|$|E

This is especially a concern for portable applications, and becomes more prominent in increasingly high-resolution, high-frame rate imagers. Therefore, new sampling techniques are needed to minimize transmitted data, while maximizing the conveyed image information. From this point of view, two approaches have been proposed and implemented in this thesis: A system-level approach, in which the classical 1 D row sampling CMOS imager is modified to a 2 D ring sampling pyramidal architecture, using the same standard three transistor (3 T) active pixel sensor (APS). A device-level approach, in which the classical orthogonal architecture has been preserved while altering the APS device structure, to design an expandable multiresolution image sensor. A new scanning scheme has been suggested for the pyramidal image sensor, resulting in an intrascene foveated dynamic range (FDR) similar in profile to that of the human eye. In this scheme, the inner rings of the imager have a higher dynamic range than the outer rings. The pyramidal imager transmits the sampled image through 8 parallel output channels, allowing higher frame rates. The human eye is known to have less sensitivity to oblique contrast. Using this fact on the typical oblique distribution of fixed pattern noise, we demonstrate lower perception of this noise than the orthogonal FPN distribution of classical CMOS imagers. The multiresolution image sensor principle is based on averaging regions of low interest from frame-sampled image kernels. One pixel is read from each kernel while keeping pixels in the region of interest at their high resolution. This significantly reduces the transferred data and increases the frame rate. Such architecture allows for programmability and expandability of multiresolution imaging applications...|$|R

These devices, which are found in digital cameras, convert light into electronic signals. Kunal Ghosh, then a graduate student in Abbas El Gamal's laboratory, wanted to make a sensor better suited for biological imaging. Across Stanford University's Campus Drive, his friend, Eric Tatt Wei Ho, a graduate student in Mark Schnitzer's lab, was working on ways of imaging neural activity. In a chance conversation, the two wondered whether there was a way to put an imaging sensor directly onto an animal. Ghosh and El Gamal approached Schnitzer with the idea. As it happened, Schnitzer had played with the concept before while working at Bell Labs. Back then, though, neither <b>electronic</b> devices nor <b>imaging</b> <b>technology</b> wer...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} charts {{a number}} of complementary explorations {{at the site of}} electronic media in art practice and design and media education. Artists are increasingly using video and computer technology in the production of their work, and these shifts are reflected in the way design and media courses are taught in Higher Education. This study seeks to relate {{a number of}} often contentious issues, but complex questions are central to any debate about the use of <b>electronic</b> <b>imaging</b> <b>technologies</b> by artists and the implications for teaching and learning. In this respect, the thesis is informed by my dual role as an artist using electronic media and as a lecturer in video and digital imaging in the Media Department at the University of Westminster. The study is based on a particular model of action research, and seeks after the manner of Glaser and Strauss (1967) to "ground" theory in the aggregate perceptions, understandings, and artistic or pedagogical orientations of those seeking to bring order to their own experiences in the settings. The text is arranged in eleven chapters. It begins by introducing the boundaries of the phenomena under study (which is necessarily ragged and untidy and challengingly gritty, since the composite issues have yet to have attracted any clarity of exposition, and the field is in any case characterised by imaginative leaps and cross-fertilisation) and the methodological and idealogical stances adopted. Methodologically the thesis is wide-ranging and eclectic, although also contained within the kind of feminist epistomology proposed by Sandra Harding (1992), Marnier Lazreg (1994) and others. It then moves on to examine a number of focal points and issues related to the use to which electronic media is put by artists. These topics include my own sustained attempts to develop non-linear computer systems for mapping associative thoughts, and a more general and more detailed study of the principles and characteristics of these systems when they are used for holding information about knowledge domains. Following this, there is a chapter dedicated to the application of these principles to a particular knowledge domain, colour theory, with the aim of designing a computer aided learning package. The interconnections between all the topics, issues and themes studied in the text are highlighted {{in the middle of the}} thesis before moving on to more specific investigation of the issue of gender in both technological education and creativity, with an emphasis on the use of <b>imaging</b> <b>technologies</b> by women artists. The impact of these technologies in terms of shifting aesthetic values and tastes forms the basis of the final chapter, and a conclusion seeks to offer both a tentative intellectual synopsis and to indicate how the exercise has influenced and affected my work as an artist. I am aware that to some extent this arrangement challenges both the linear quality of conventional research reportage and academic distrust of promiscuously interpenetrating ideas. I trust that this form of discourse, deliberately chosen, is experienced as working within its own terms...|$|R
40|$|The {{capability}} to extract objective and quantitatively accurate information from 3 -D radiographic biomedical images has not {{kept pace with}} the capabilities to produce the images themselves. This is rather an ironic paradox, since {{on the one hand}} the new 3 -D and 4 -D imaging capabilities promise significant potential for providing greater specificity and sensitivity (i. e., precise objective discrimination and accurate quantitative measurement of body tissue characteristics and function) in clinical diagnostic and basic investigative imaging procedures than ever possible before, but on the other hand, the momentous advances in computer and associated <b>electronic</b> <b>imaging</b> <b>technology</b> which have made these 3 -D imaging capabilities possible have not been concomitantly developed for full exploitation of these capabilities. Therefore, we have developed a powerful new microcomputer-based system which permits detailed investigations and evaluation of 3 -D and 4 -D (dynamic 3 -D) biomedical images. The system comprises a special workstation to which all the information in a large 3 -D image data base is accessible for rapid display, manipulation, and measurement. The system provides important capabilities for simultaneously representing and analyzing both structural and functional data and their relationships in various organs of the body. This paper provides a detailed description of this system, {{as well as some of}} the rationale, background, theoretical concepts, and practical considerations related to system implementation...|$|E

50|$|Sutton was the {{photographer}} for James Clerk Maxwell's pioneering 1861 demonstration of color photography. In a practical {{trial of a}} thought-experiment Maxwell had published in 1855, Sutton took three separate black-and-white photographs of a multicolored ribbon, one through a blue filter, one through a green filter, and one through a red filter. Using three projectors equipped with similar filters, the three photographs were projected superimposed on a screen. The additive primaries variously blended to reproduce a gamut of color. The photographic materials available to Sutton were mainly sensitive to blue light, barely sensitive to green and practically insensitive to red, so the result was only a partial success. Forty years later, adequately panchromatic plates and films had made excellent color reproduction possible by this method, {{as demonstrated by the}} work of Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky. The principle of reproducing a full range of color by three-color analysis and synthesis is based on the nature of human color vision and underlies nearly all practical chemical and <b>electronic</b> color <b>imaging</b> <b>technologies.</b> Sutton's ribbon image is sometimes called the first color photograph. There were, in fact, earlier and possibly better color photographs made by experimenters who used a completely different, more purely chemical process, but the colors rapidly faded when exposed to light for viewing. Sutton's photographs preserved the color information in black-and-white silver images containing no actual coloring matter, so they are very light-fast and durable and the set may reasonably be described as the first permanent color photograph.|$|R
