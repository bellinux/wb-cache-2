5|$|Like other animals, fish {{suffer from}} {{diseases}} and parasites. To prevent disease {{they have a}} variety of defenses. Non-specific defenses include the skin and scales, as well as the mucus layer secreted by the epidermis that traps and inhibits the growth of microorganisms. If pathogens breach these defenses, fish can develop an inflammatory response that increases blood flow to the infected region and delivers white blood cells that attempt to destroy pathogens. Specific defenses respond to particular pathogens recognised by the fish's body, i.e., an immune response. In recent years, vaccines have become widely used in aquaculture and also with ornamental fish, for example furunculosis vaccines in farmed salmon and koi <b>herpes</b> <b>virus</b> in koi.|$|E

40|$|Persistent viruses {{present some}} {{particular}} problems for vaccine design. As for acute non-persistent viruses, the prime {{goal of a}} vaccine should be to prevent primary infection.

This chapter deals with selected persistent DNA viruses, in particular the human <b>herpes</b> <b>viruses.</b> <b>Herpes</b> <b>viruses</b> The family of <b>herpes</b> <b>viruses</b> is widely distributed in the animal kingdom and comparative sequence analysis suggests they have been co-evolving with their individual hosts for millions of years.

5|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years, the {{development}} of antiviral drugs has increased rapidly, mainly driven by the AIDS pandemic. Antiviral drugs are often nucleoside analogues, which are molecules very similar, but not identical to DNA building blocks. When the replication of virus DNA begins, some of these fake building blocks are incorporated. As soon as that happens, replication stops prematurely—the fake building blocks lack the essential features that allow the addition of further building blocks. Thus, DNA production is halted, and the virus can no longer reproduce. Examples of nucleoside analogues are aciclovir for <b>herpes</b> <b>virus</b> infections and lamivudine for HIV and hepatitis B virus infections. Aciclovir {{is one of the}} oldest and most frequently prescribed antiviral drugs.|$|E
5|$|Three more {{individuals}} {{who say they}} had unprotected sex with Usher sued him on allegations of fraud, sexual battery, infliction of emotional distress and more, alleging that he was positive for the <b>herpes</b> <b>virus</b> and didn't tell them in advance. All three are represented by attorney Lisa Bloom who said {{at the news conference}} on 8 August 2017 that one of her three clients had contracted genital herpes allegedly from Usher. One of the accusers, Quantasia Sharpton, said she had unprotected sex with him after a concert she attended around her 19th birthday. The other two accusers, one male, one female, preferred to remain anonymous plaintiffs. Sharpton admitted she tested negative for herpes and Bloom stated she didn't know if the singer had the disease.|$|E
5|$|Viruses have {{different}} {{mechanisms by which}} they produce disease in an organism, which depends largely on the viral species. Mechanisms at the cellular level primarily include cell lysis, the breaking open and subsequent death of the cell. In multicellular organisms, if enough cells die, the whole organism will start to suffer the effects. Although viruses cause disruption of healthy homeostasis, resulting in disease, they may exist relatively harmlessly within an organism. An example would include {{the ability of the}} herpes simplex virus, which causes cold sores, to remain in a dormant state within the human body. This is called latency and is a characteristic of the herpes viruses, including Epstein–Barr virus, which causes glandular fever, and varicella zoster virus, which causes chickenpox and shingles. Most people have been infected with {{at least one of these}} types of <b>herpes</b> <b>virus.</b> However, these latent viruses might sometimes be beneficial, as the presence of the virus can increase immunity against bacterial pathogens, such as Yersinia pestis.|$|E
50|$|All the {{currently}} known bird and reptile species are alphaherpesviruses.

25|$|Following {{infection}} of a cell, {{a cascade of}} <b>herpes</b> <b>virus</b> proteins, called immediate-early, early, and late, are produced. Research using flow cytometry on {{another member of the}} <b>herpes</b> <b>virus</b> family, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, indicates the possibility of an additional lytic stage, delayed-late. These stages of lytic infection, particularly late lytic, are distinct from the latency stage. In the case of HSV-1, no protein products are detected during latency, whereas they are detected during the lytic cycle.|$|E
25|$|In HSV-1 {{infected}} cells, ICP0 activates transcription of many viral {{and cellular}} genes. It acts synergistically with HSV-1 immediate early (IE) protein, ICP4, and {{is essential for}} reactivation of latent <b>herpes</b> <b>virus</b> and viral replication.|$|E

40|$|<b>Herpes</b> simplex <b>virus</b> infections {{of humans}} {{have been known}} since ancient times. Contemporary society has {{witnessed}} a series of devastating manifestations of <b>herpes</b> simplex <b>virus</b> infections [...] namely, genital <b>herpes</b> simplex <b>virus</b> infection and neonatal <b>herpes</b> simplex <b>virus</b> infection. With the evolution of society, particularly advances in birth control and increasing promiscuity, the seroprevalence of <b>herpes</b> simplex <b>virus</b> type 2 infections has increased worldwide, however, more so in developed societies.

The consequences of vertical transmission of <b>herpes</b> simplex <b>virus</b> from mother to child, resulting in neonatal <b>herpes</b> simplex <b>virus</b> infection, can be devastating. Current efforts, which are directed toward the treatment of neonatal herpes, have established the value of drugs such as vidarabine and acyclovir.

Human <b>Herpes</b> <b>Virus</b> 8, the cause of Kaposi's sarcoma which is often seen in AIDS patients, was identified in 1994.

500|$|Since the {{creation}} of the herpes hype, some people experience negative feelings related to the condition following diagnosis, in particular if they have acquired the genital form of the disease. Feelings can include depression, fear of rejection, feelings of isolation, fear of being found out, and self-destructive feelings. These feelings usually lessen over time. Much of the hysteria and stigma surrounding herpes stems from a media campaign beginning in the late 1970s and peaking in the early 1980s. Multiple articles were worded in fear-mongering and anxiety-provoking terminology, such as the now-ubiquitous [...] "attacks", [...] "outbreaks", [...] "victims", and [...] "sufferers". At one point, the term [...] "herpetic" [...] even entered the popular lexicon. The articles were published by Reader's Digest, U.S. News, and Time magazine, among others. A made-for-TV movie was named Intimate Agony. The peak was when Time magazine had 'Herpes: The New Scarlet Letter' on the cover in August 1982, forever stigmatizing the word in the public mind. Herpes support groups have been formed in the United States and the UK, providing information about herpes and running message forums and dating websites for sufferers.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the use of RNA interference to inhibit <b>herpes</b> simplex <b>virus</b> type- 1 replication in vitro. For <b>herpes</b> simplex <b>virus</b> type- 1 gene silencing, three different small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting the <b>herpes</b> simplex <b>virus</b> type- 1 UL 39 gene (sequence si-UL 39 - 1, si-UL 39 - 2, and si-UL 39 - 3) were used, which encode the large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase, an essential enzyme for DNA synthesis. <b>Herpes</b> simplex <b>virus</b> type- 1 was isolated from saliva samples and mucocutaneous lesions from infected patients. All mucocutaneous lesions’ samples were positive for <b>herpes</b> simplex <b>virus</b> type- 1 by real-time PCR and by <b>virus</b> isolation; all <b>herpes</b> simplex <b>virus</b> type- 1 from saliva samples were positive by real-time PCR and 50 % were positive by virus isolation.
