40|$|Background: In Sweden all limited {{companies}} have to submit themselves to an audit. Most member-countries in the European Union have chosen to exempt small companies from the statutory audit requirement. In 2003 the Ministry of Justice presented a memorandum that, among other things, suggested an extended regulation about auditor’s and agency’s conflict of interest. Some advisory bodies to the memorandum fear that this will either lead to increased costs for small companies or inferior quality if they do the accountancy themselves. This {{has led to a}} discussion about the statutory audit for small companies. Small owner-managed companies are {{a major part of the}} companies in Sweden. For these companies the annual report serves little purpose, both internally and externally. The <b>external</b> <b>interested</b> <b>party</b> that everyone thinks wants to keep the statutory audit is the Tax Authority. This thesis will try to find out what opinion the Tax Authority has about a possible removal of the statutory audit for small companies. Purpose: The purpose with this thesis is to find out whether the Tax Authority attaches a great importance to the statutory audit for small companies or not. Furthermore, the purpose is to find out if they look upon the audit as a quality guarantee for the company’s bookkeeping and if they see any alternatives to the statutory audit.

Most member-countries in the European Union have chosen to exempt small companies from the statutory audit requirement. In 2003 the Ministry of Justice presented a memorandum that, among other things, suggested an extended regulation about auditor’s and agency’s conflict of interest. Some advisory bodies to the memorandum fear that this will either lead to increased costs for small companies, {{when they have to}} engage two different agencies to do their accounting and auditing, or inferior quality if they do the accountancy themselves. This has lead to a discussion about the statutory audit for small companies. Small owner-managed companies are {{a major part of the}} companies in Sweden. For these companies the annual report serves little purpose, both internally and externally. The <b>external</b> <b>interested</b> <b>party</b> that everyone thinks wants to keep the statutory audit is the Tax Authority.

40|$|Alcohol fuels, ethanol or methanol, {{have low}} cetane number, 9 {{respectively}} 3, {{and are therefore}} not possible to use in diesel engines without engine modifications. Normal practice is to add an ignition improver to the alcohol fuel. Ignition improvers available on the market are rather expensive and are normally mixed directly into the alcohol fuel. An early concept was to inject {{a small amount of}} diesel fuel into the cylinders before injecting the alcohol. This gives satisfactory operation but requires two fuel injection systems which increase cost and maintenance. Dissolved ignition improvers of type polyethylene glycoI (PEG) are used in Scania and Volvo engines with good success but alternative additives are of interest to investigate. A prornising solution is to use an on-board reactor to generate ethers from the alcohol fuel. From ethanol (EtOH), diethyl ether (DEE) may be dehydrated and from methanol (MeOH), dimethylether (DME) may be dehydrated. Both these ethers have high cetane numbers, 90 respectively 60, and may be used as ignition improvers. This research program has been set up {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} ethers as ignition improvers and compare the results with the conventional PEG improvers. The project was approved by the Combustion Engine Research Center (CERC) at the board meeting 1996 - 0] - 30 and has been performed at the Department of Thermo and Fluid Dynamics. Within CERC, the partners Scania and Volvo LV have been co-sponsoring the project from the start and Aspen Petroleum.

40|$|The {{most common}} {{challenges}} and obstacles encountered by construction organizations {{during the process}} of implementing and using environmental management systems are related to the inherent peculiarities of the construction sector. Several studies have shown that one of the issues involving the greatest level of uncertainty is the identification and assessment of environmental impacts. In order to improve the identification of the significance of environmental impacts of construction projects and sites, which will lead to greater efficiency and robustness in environmental management systems, this paper extends the systematic approach for identifying and assessing potential adverse environmental impacts at the pre-construction stage presented in Gangolells et al. (2009) by introducing the assessment of the concerns of interested parties. By considering concerns amongst internal and <b>external</b> <b>interested</b> <b>parties,</b> one can assess the significance of environmental impacts taking into account not only the severity of the impacts but also local perceptions and international challenges, thereby ensuring that the determination of the impacts’ significance is appropriate to the particular socioeconomic and biophysical environments surrounding construction sites. In order to quantitatively measure concerns among internal and <b>external</b> <b>interested</b> <b>parties</b> for each of the 37 environmental impacts related to a construction project, we developed corresponding indicators and assessment scales {{with the help of a}} panel of experts. A series of χ 2 tests conducted over 76 new-start construction projects clearly revealed that the severity of environmental impacts is not correlated with the concerns of interested parties. The development of a formal quantitative method and the subsequent definition of a threshold make it possible to obtain advance knowledge of the significance – and, therefore, the acceptability – of each potential environmental impact for a particular construction project. A total score for each construction project alternative is also obtained, so the improved methodology provides a consistent basis for comparing construction companies and construction sites. Finally, two case studies are presented in order to demonstrate the benefits of the improved methodology. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|E

40|$|Developing {{administrative}} and financial mechanisms to achieve transparency and compliance with legal frameworks related to mine operation and closure {{is a major}} challenge. Ensuring the appropriate level of disclosure, transparency, and accountability of all compliant and non-compliant parties, and accessibility of this information to <b>external</b> <b>interested</b> <b>parties</b> is a cornerstone of achieving a well-governed minerals sector. This research investigates mining company voluntary environmental disclosures in Zambia {{as an indicator of}} how the EITI (Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative) may or may not achieve transparency and accountability. Our research findings drew on three sources: literature review, qualitative primary data with EITI and government officials and content analysis to compare public environmental reporting via company websites of a total of 27 mining companies operating in Zambia. Our analysis found that non-EITI and EITI selected companies disclose similar provisions for environmental liabilities at country, subsidiary, or multinational level. While EITI compliance may improve the environmental financial disclosure by mining companies, the detail and specificity of the voluntarily disclosed information is insufficiently transparent to third parties investigating whether governments and companies are compliant with the law in terms of environmental and governance considerations. We propose solutions to achieve transparency in practice by linking aggregated international voluntary initiatives (akin to the EITI) with mandatory jurisdiction-level reforms in mining financial securities and mine closure legislation accounted at the tenement level that is publicly available. Such reforms enable both independent accounting of financial transactions and improved national capacity for minerals sector governance that attracts international investment and incentivises an innovative, environmentally sustainable, and an economically beneficial mining industry...|$|E

40|$|This Working Paper {{analyses}} {{the institutional}} setting for regulatory reform. It {{is the first}} comprehensive analysis of regulatory oversight bodies. The analysis adopts a functional approach through four core functions: i) oversight of the rule-making process; ii) assisting rule makers in their evidence-based analysis; iii) challenging the quality of regulatory proposals; iv) advocating for quality/better regulation. The report analyses the key factors contributing to success, as well as elements for the credibility of regulatory oversight. The report also finds that regulatory quality oversight represents a tool for policy coherence for countries {{and needs to be}} articulated with other core policies, such as microeconomic and competition-oriented reforms, as well as overall reforms of the public administration. Forging of a political constituency requires active communications, political buy-in and support from a champion, and an <b>external</b> constituency of <b>interested</b> <b>parties</b> to support advocacy.

40|$|Organisational change {{stories are}} often {{constructed}} around a linear series of 2 ̆ 7 successful 2 ̆ 7 events that serve {{to show the}} company {{in a positive light}} to any <b>interested</b> <b>external</b> <b>party.</b> These stories of company success sanitize complex change processes and offer data for change experts to formulate neat linear prescriptions on how to best manage change. This article criticizes this position and argues that change is a far more dynamic political process consisting of competing histories and ongoing multiple change narratives which may vie for dominance in seeking to be the change story. A central aim is to identify and unpack narratives of change in order to highlight a number of theoretical and methodological implications for management research. It is argued that post-hoc rationalized stories should not be used as a knowledge base for prescriptive lessons or theoretical developments, nor should research data simply be presented as a single authentic story of change...|$|R
40|$|A {{task was}} {{identified}} within the fission-product-transport work package {{to develop a}} path forward for doing testing to determine behavior of volatile fission products behavior and to engage members of the NGNP community to advise and dissent on the approach. The following document is {{a summary of the}} discussions and the specific approaches suggested for components of the testing. Included in the summary isare the minutes of the conference call that was held with INL and <b>external</b> <b>interested</b> <b>parties</b> to elicit comments on the approaches brought forward by the INL participants. The conclusion was that an initial non-radioactive, single component test will be useful to establish the limits of currently available chemical detection methods, and to evaluated source-dispersion uniformity. In parallel, development of a real-time low-concentration monitoring method is believed to be useful in detecting rapid dispersion as well as desorption phenomena. Ultimately, the test cycle is expected to progress to the use of radio-traced species, simply because this method will allow the lowest possible detection limits. The consensus of the conference call was that {{there is no need for}} an in-core test because the duct and heat exchanger surfaces that will be the sorption target will be outside the main neutron flux and will not be affected by irradiation. Participants in the discussion and contributors to the INL approach were Jeffrey Berg, Pattrick Calderoni, Gary Groenewold, Paul Humrickhouse, Brad Merrill, and Phil Winston.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study the {{development}} of Quality Management System at Automotive Excellence Center due to the MS ISO 9001 : 2008 requirement. The objective of this thesis are: 1) to study and enhance the knowledge on implementation of MS ISO 9001 : 2008 in industry, 2) to analyses the requirement for implementation of a quality management system at the Automotive Excellence Center of Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and 3) to develop a quality manual and quality procedure based on the requirement of MS ISO 9001 : 2008. ISO is the International Organization of Standardization {{in which it is}} the world wide federation of national standard bodies (ISO member bodies). It promotes the adaption of the process approach when developing, implementing and improving the effectiveness of a quality management system. ISO 9001 : 2008 is the continuation of MS ISO 9001 : 2000 with some changes made in the clauses. There are eight section modeled on the sectional organization of the ISO 9001 : 2008 standard. Section are further divided into several subsections representing main quality system processes. Each subsection defines general policies and basic principles for the pertinent quality system process, summarizes responsibilities and methods and references relevant operational procedures and other documents. The purpose of the development of quality manual is to define and describe the quality system as well as to define the authorities and responsibilities of the management personnel involved in the operation of the system. Furthermore, it is to provide a general description of all processes comprising the quality system. Another purpose of the development of the quality manual is to present the quality system to customers, suppliers, regulators and other <b>external</b> <b>interested</b> <b>parties,</b> and to inform them what specific controls are implemented at Automotive Excellence Center to assure quality...|$|E
40|$|Since the Ok Tedi {{lawsuit in}} 1994 {{highlighted}} the environmental degradation issue, Multinational Corporations (MNCs) operating in Papua New Guniea (PNG) {{have come under}} scrutiny for causing environmental degradation. This scrutiny created animosity between resource owners and the developers (MNCs), {{to such an extent}} that the bitterness created anxiety about their future among the MN Cs. Various attempts have been made in PNG to minimise the adverse impacts caused by the MNC operations, however, environmental degradation continues to be adverse. The PNG government will not arbitrate in this issue because of its conflict of interests. The problem of environmental degradation caused by MNCs needs to be exposed to minimise the adverse impacts. Environmental disclosure to <b>external</b> <b>interested</b> <b>parties</b> is a possible source of exposure which has not been explored. This is because environmental accounting is a 2 ̆ 7 green 2 ̆ 7 area which many countries are just beginning to incorporate and enforce in their legislation. In addition, there is no law to enforce environmental reporting. It is currently provided voluntarily (Deegan, 1996). This study investigates the possibility of engaging environmental disclosure to address the environmental issue in PNG. The focus in this study is on Australian MNCs because their annual reports are accessible and Australian MNCs dominate PNG economy. The study seeks to establish whether Australian MNC in environmentally sensitive industries, currently provide adequate environmental reports within their financial statements. The disclosure requirement is based on the Legitimacy theory because the MNCs operate under a social contract with societies and are therefore obliged to legitimise both their presence and their activities. To achieve this goal, MNCs need to provide environmental reports within their financial statements. MNCs currently lodge environmental impact plans with every proposal. Despite this lodgement, environmental degradation persists, therefore they ought to report on the implementation of their environmental impact plans within their financial statements (Gray, 1990). This study is patterned after Patten (1992) who studied oil companies following the Valdez oil spill. Patten noted a sizeable increase in environmental reporting following the incident. Similarly, a content analysis of the annual reports of Australian MNCs found that environmental disclosure is higher among MNCs who operate in PNG than those which only operate in Australia. Increases are noticeable after 1994 which indicates that the Ok Tedi lawsuit influenced disclosure. It appears that MNCs will only increase their environmental disclosure when coming under scrutiny. It would be interesting and informative to analyse all MNCs in PNG because Australian MNCs are not the only ones operating in the sensitive industries in PNG. Future studies may undertake such an analysis. In order to maintain a constant surveillance on environmental degradation, MNCs ought to continually provide environmental information with their annual financial statements. When MNCs fully disclose their environmental degradation, it is expected that ethical investors will be powerful enough to exert pressure on MNCs to be more sustainable in their operations and minimise environmental degradation...|$|E

40|$|Accounting is {{frequently}} described and {{recognized as the}} language of business because the external financial reporting function is extensively used as a principal means of communicating results of corporate economic activity to <b>interested</b> <b>external</b> <b>parties.</b> However, deficiencies {{with respect to the}} usefulness of the traditional accounting-type information have been increasingly noted and commented on. A possible explanation for this is that generally accepted accounting principles and the conceptual frameworks for the external financial reporting function that have been developed so far in various accounting jurisdictions have promoted the dominance of investor/creditor interest groups. The operational models subsequently developed from these frameworks focus on often narrowly defined, easily quantifiable financial-type impacts, very often ignoring potentially important economic events that are not directly and immediately quantifiable in monetary terms. This case study of a Finnish chemical company, Kemira Oyj, critically examines one company’s recent attempts to address this problem via the medium of environmental reporting in response to the increasing demand for disclosures on the impact of corporate operations on the environment...|$|R
