Since death is pronounced after asystole and given that the <b>expectation</b> <b>is</b> for a rapid death in lethal injection, multiple drugs are required, specifically potassium chloride to stop the heart. In fact, in the case of Clarence Ray Allen, a second dose of potassium chloride was required to attain asystole. The position of most death-penalty supporters is that death should be attained in a reasonable amount of time.|$|E
25|$|Fairly {{straightforward}} statistics provide {{estimates of}} whether associations between genes on lists {{are greater than}} what one would expect by chance. These statistics are interesting, even if they represent a substantial oversimplification of {{what is really going}} on. Here is an example. Suppose there are 10,000 genes in an experiment, only 50 (0.5%) of which play a known role in making cholesterol. The experiment identifies 200 regulated genes. Of those, 40 (20%) turn out to be on a list of cholesterol genes as well. Based on the overall prevalence of the cholesterol genes (0.5%) one expects an average of 1 cholesterol gene for every 200 regulated genes, that is, 0.005 times 200. This <b>expectation</b> <b>is</b> an average, so one expects to see more than one some of the time. The question becomes how often we would see 40 instead of 1 due to pure chance.|$|E

25|$|Christian theologians {{agree that}} the New Testament has a single and {{consistent}} theological focus on the salvific nature of Christ, but the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament consists of several different theologies. Some of these complement each other, whilst others are contradictory, even within the same book. Despite {{the lack of a}} single unifying theology, common themes recur, including (although no list can be exhaustive) monotheism, the divine origins of human morality, God's election of a chosen people, the idea of the coming Messiah, and the concepts of sin, faithfulness, and redemption. The study of these is central to both Jewish and Christian theologies, even if they differ in their approaches (see Christianity and Judaism). For example, although both religions believe in the coming Messiah, the Jewish <b>expectation</b> <b>is</b> different from the Christian view. Within Christianity, themes such as the nature of God (trinitarianism and nontrinitarianism), nature of Jesus, views of the old covenant, original sin, predestination, ordination of women, hell, biblical prophecies, etc. have continued {{to be a matter of}} dispute among theologians and various denominations.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the larger}} {{societal}} context of Bedouin culture is changing, {{particularly in the}} Negev. For the past several decades, {{the policy of the}} Israeli government has been to move the Negev Bedouin from the desert to official settlements. This has had several significant effects on Negev Bedouin society. Significantly, the move from a nomadic lifestyle to a sedentary one has displaced the Bedouin women from their previously critical economic roles. Moreover, the shift to a sedentary lifestyle means that wage labor has largely replaced agriculture as the main economic structure for the Negev Bedouin. Traditionally, women in Negev Bedouin society were not allowed to work outside the home. This <b>expectation</b> <b>is</b> still in place today. As the Negev Bedouin have shifted away from agriculture, the productive responsibilities have shifted to the men. Meanwhile, the patriarchal system that developed around the traditional economic structure has been maintained. Ultimately, this has resulted in a loss of power within the household for Bedouin women. It is still considered culturally inappropriate for women to interact with strangers (especially strange men), and the men of the family still mediate their families' interactions with society as a whole. The loss of their economic capabilities has meant that Negev Bedouin women are increasingly excluded from decision-making within the household. As a result, the overwhelming majority of important household decisions are made by men.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Patient <b>expectations</b> have <b>been</b> {{identified}} as a factor that may account for individual differences in recovery after total hip replacement (THR) surgery. However, patient <b>expectations</b> have not <b>been</b> studied within a valid theoretical framework. This study employed the World Health Organization's model of health, the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), to classify the content of preoperative patient expectations of THR. METHODS: A European cohort of 1, 108 patients preoperatively reported 2 types of expectations. Patients reported what they anticipated surgery {{would enable them to}} do that they needed {{to be able to do}} ("need" expectation), and what they would like to be able to do ("desire" expectation) in a year's time. Free-text responses were independently classified by 2 researchers to 1 or more of the ICF constructs of impairment, activity limitation, and participation restriction. RESULTS: Interrater reliability was high (κ = ≥ 0. 87). All patient <b>expectations</b> <b>were</b> classified to the ICF constructs. Less than 5 % of patient <b>expectations</b> <b>were</b> {{identified as}} impairment, 58 % of "need" <b>expectations</b> <b>were</b> {{identified as a}}ctivity limitations, and 45 % of "desire" <b>expectations</b> <b>were</b> identified as activity limitations and participation restrictions combined. CONCLUSION: The ICF is a suitable theoretical framework to study patient expectations of THR. THR targets impairment; however, few patient <b>expectations</b> <b>were</b> classified to the ICF definition of impairment. The majority of patient <b>expectations</b> <b>were</b> classified as activity limitation or a combination of activity limitation and participation restriction.
