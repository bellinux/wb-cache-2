5|$|A {{few weeks}} after Morris {{announced}} his departure from the team, Martin announced that David Nedohin, the fourth player on his former provincial rival Randy Ferbey's team, would join Martin's team. Martin and team won their first event of the season at the Shoot-Out. They made the semifinals in their next event at the Point Optical Curling Classic, but Martin injured his back during the semifinal game. Jeff Sharp subbed in at lead, and Martin's team finished the event as runners-up to Jeff Stoughton. After winning {{the final of the}} Direct <b>Horizontal</b> <b>Drilling</b> Fall Classic over Brock Virtue and posting a semifinals finish at the Cactus Pheasant Classic, Martin played in the Masters Grand Slam, finishing the round robin with a 3–1 win-loss record. He proceeded to win his games over Kevin Koe and Liu Rui before reaching the final, where he played a close game with Glenn Howard until Howard pulled away with the win.|$|E

50|$|Directional {{drilling}} (or slant drilling) is {{the practice}} of drilling non-vertical wells. It {{can be broken down}} into four main groups: oilfield directional drilling, utility installation directional <b>drilling</b> (<b>horizontal</b> directional <b>drilling),</b> directional boring, and surface in seam (SIS), which horizontally intersects a vertical well target to extract coal bed methane.|$|R
25|$|The {{calculus}} for {{peak oil}} has {{changed with the}} introduction of unconventional production methods. In particular, the combination of <b>horizontal</b> <b>drilling</b> and hydraulic fracturing has resulted in a significant increase in production from previously uneconomic plays. Analysts expect that $150 billion will be spent on further developing North American tight oil fields in 2015. The large increase in tight oil production {{is one of the reasons}} behind the price drop in late 2014. Certain rock strata contain hydrocarbons but have low permeability and are not thick from a vertical perspective. Conventional vertical wells would be unable to economically retrieve these hydrocarbons. <b>Horizontal</b> <b>drilling,</b> extending horizontally through the strata, permits the well to access a much greater volume of the strata. Hydraulic fracturing creates greater permeability and increases hydrocarbon flow to the wellbore.|$|E
25|$|Turbine {{drilling}} is best {{used for}} drilling hard rocks at high bit RPM's with diamond impregnated bits, {{and can be}} used with an angled drive shaft for directional drilling and <b>horizontal</b> <b>drilling.</b> It competes though with moyno motors and increasingly with rotary steerable systems and is again out of favour.|$|E

25|$|Since {{parts of}} this region have been {{producing}} gas from wells drilled to the deeper Oriskany Formation sandstone, older wells that are no longer viable can be reused, either by fracturing the Marcellus layer in the existing well bore, or by refinishing the bore using <b>horizontal</b> <b>drilling</b> into the Marcellus.

25|$|Northern Michigan has {{significant}} natural gas reserves along the Antrim shale formation in northern Michigan. By some estimates {{it is the}} 15th largest gas field in the nation. Drilling activity peaked in the late 1980s and early 1990s, In 2014, Encana, the Canadian company who had been drilling in Northern Michigan, sold their mineral rights to Marathon Oil order to focus on more profitable operations elsewhere. For oil interest, Encana amassed rights for the Collingwood-Utica Shale (Michigan) between 2008 and 2010, mostly in Cheboygan, Kalkaska, Michigan and Missaukee counties. The Collingwood layer is two miles below the surface and would require <b>horizontal</b> <b>drilling.</b>|$|E
25|$|Conventional {{crude oil}} is {{normally}} {{extracted from the}} ground by drilling oil wells into a petroleum reservoir, allowing oil to flow into them under natural reservoir pressures, although artificial lift and techniques such as <b>horizontal</b> <b>drilling,</b> water flooding and gas injection are often required to maintain production. When primary production {{is used in the}} Venezuelan oil sands, where the extra-heavy oil is about 50 degrees Celsius, the typical oil recovery rates are about 8–12%. Canadian oil sands are much colder and more biodegraded, so bitumen recovery rates are usually only about 5–6%. Historically, primary recovery was used in the more fluid areas of Canadian oil sands. However, it recovered {{only a small fraction of}} the oil in place, so it not often used today.|$|E

Renewables in 2010 accounted for 16.7% of the world's energy, however Biomass energy accounted for 11.4% meaning that non-carbon dioxide producing renewables accounted for only 4.9% of the world's energy use with the vast majority of that renewable energy coming from hydroelectric production at 3.34% further leaving 1.56% of renewable energy derived from newer advanced technologies like ethanol, biodiesel, wind, solar, ocean power and geothermal (see graph to right).|$|E
25|$|In the 90's the U.S. {{initially}} {{started using}} more natural gas because new technology {{was able to}} lower its generation costs and pipeline expansion was able to increase its availability. Then under the Presidency of George W. Bush (2000-2008), {{a combination of factors}} led to a growth in the natural gas industry. Bush passed the Energy Policy Act in 2005, that exempted chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing from the Safe Water Drinking Act, which means more places were being fracked. Starting around the same time hydraulic fracturing and <b>horizontal</b> <b>drilling</b> became more widely used since they made shale energy reserves more accessible. The industry pushed to drill more natural gas in more places, because they believed that they had the technology, expertise, and need as well as the fact that tremendous energy and profit could be made from more sites. However, until this day 94% of the country’s offshore acreage has not been made available to energy development, despite requests from the natural gas industry.|$|E
500|$|The Larrys Creek {{watershed}} has two {{deposits of}} low volatile bituminous coal along Roaring Run and a small, deep natural gas field. A potentially large source {{of natural gas}} is the Marcellus Shale, which lies [...] below the surface here and stretches from New York through Pennsylvania to Ohio and West Virginia. Estimates of the total natural gas in the black shale from the Devonian era range from 168 to 516trillion cubic feet (4.76 to 14.6trillionm3), with at least 10 percent considered recoverable. In November 2007, drilling within the Larrys Creek watershed started in Mifflin Township, just west of Salladasburg, with a [...] deep well. A second well was drilled in Mifflin Township in December 2007, and by February 2008 every well drilled in Lycoming County was producing natural gas.
