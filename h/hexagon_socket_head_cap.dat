5000|$|Soon after SPS {{had begun}} {{producing}} the hex <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> set screw, Hallowell {{had the idea}} to make a hex <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> <b>cap</b> screw (SHCS). Hallowell said, [...] "Up to this moment {{none of us had}} ever seen a <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> <b>cap</b> screw, and what I am about to relate concerns what I believe was the first <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> <b>cap</b> screw ever made in this country U.S.." [...] SPS gave their line of screws the Unbrako brand name, chosen for its echoing of the word [...]|$|R

5000|$|A {{counterbore}} (symbol: ⌴) is a cylindrical flat-bottomed {{hole that}} enlarges another coaxial hole, or the tool {{used to create}} that feature. A counterbore hole is typically used when a fastener, such as a <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> <b>cap</b> screw, is required to sit flush with or {{below the level of}} a workpiece's surface.|$|R
5000|$|Concerning the {{dissemination}} of the screws and wrenches, Hallowell said that [...] "the transition from a square head set screw refers here to the then-ubiquitous external-wrenching square drive to a <b>hexagon</b> <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> hollow set screw, for {{which had to be}} developed special keys or wrenches for tightening or loosening the screw, was the cause of more profanity among the mechanics and machine manufacturers than any other single event that happened. … I am sure that the old-timers who read this book will remember this period vividly." [...] (These transitional growing pains echo those experienced many decades later with the adoption of the Torx drive).|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} type of joint between shell and arbor {{involves}} a fairly large cylindrical feature at center (to locate the shell concentric to the arbor) and two driving lugs or tangs that drive the shell with a positive engagement (like a dog clutch). Within the central cylindrical area, one or several <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> <b>cap</b> screws fasten the shell to the arbor.|$|R
5000|$|A socket is {{typically}} a cylinder {{which has a}} female six- or twelve-point recessed opening sized to fit over the common male hexagonal head of a bolt or nut fastener. The {{opposite end of the}} socket wrench has a standardized (ANSI B107, ISO, or other consensus standard) square recess to accept the socket wrench's drive size. Male drivers are also produced for use with <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> <b>cap</b> screws, and are often called Allen drivers (trademark) or the generic term male bit drivers ...|$|R
40|$|Torque tension {{testing of}} a newly {{designed}} Reusable Solid Rocket Motor nozzle bolted assembly was successfully completed. Test {{results showed that the}} 3 -sigma preload variation was as expected at the required input torque level and the preload relaxation were within the engineering limits. A shim installation technique was demonstrated as a simple process to fill a shear lip gap between nozzle housings in the joint region. A new automated torque system was successfully demonstrated in this test. This torque control tool was found to be very precise and accurate. The bolted assembly performance was further evaluated using the Nozzle Structural Test Bed. Both current <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> <b>cap</b> screw and proposed multiphase alloy bolt configurations were tested. Results indicated that joint skip and bolt bending were significantly reduced with the new multiphase alloy bolt design. This paper summarizes all the test results completed to date...|$|R
5000|$|The engine {{features}} four inline cylinders inclined {{at an angle}} of approximately 45 degrees (hence the name), and this is because Vauxhall had originally planned to develop a whole family of engines all built on the same production line. There was to be slant four and V8 versions in both petrol and diesel versions, designed {{under the guidance of}} Vauxhall's then chief engineer, John Alden. Although several diesel 4-cylinder and a V8 petrol engine prototypes were built only the 4-cylinder petrol made it to series production. There is a single overhead camshaft operating two valves per cylinder. An ingenious valve train design incorporating an inclined <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> <b>cap</b> screw, allowed valve clearances to be adjusted with a feeler gauge and an Allen key. The block and crossflow head are both of cast iron. The layout makes good use of the cylinder inclination to lower the overall height of the engine, which allowed for more aerodynamic designs of cars to be achieved by lowering the bonnet line. It also means most of the engine is very easy to access for maintenance, {{with the exception of the}} exhaust manifold and spark plugs, which are [...] "underneath" [...] the slanted cylinders.|$|R
5000|$|Male bit {{drivers are}} {{sometimes}} incorrectly {{referred to as}} [...] "sockets", but are in fact the opposite of a socket, in that bit drivers fit into a <b>socket</b> <b>head</b> <b>cap</b> screw or pipe plug, rather than fit over a male drive head on a nut or bolt as a socket does. A socket is a [...] "female" [...] recess or opening which receives another object, together as a fitting connection. A socket is not a protruding [...] "male" [...] connection. Common male bit drivers of this type include Allen hex wrenches (in both metric and fractional inch sizes), Torx (T-3 thru T-50) spline wrenches, 4-point (square), and 12-point (triple square) male bit drivers. Other specialized screw heads that are often installed or removed with screwdriver type handles and appropriate type tip have socket varieties that fit the various screw head types and a can be attached to a socket wrench. Conversely, for low torque situations, a [...] "socket spinner" [...] screwdriver handle with a socket wrench type fitting on one end can be attached to {{many different types of}} sockets, bit drivers and extensions.|$|R

40|$|The chronological {{formation}} {{and development of}} three rat spermatozoon head components - the nucleus, acrosomic system and perinuclear theca - were investigated by electron microscopy during spermiogenesis and transit through the epididymis. Chromatin condensation involves an intermediate step of coarse chromatin filament formation. Coarse filaments aggregate into coarse chromatin clumps which, in turn, fuse into a dense homogeneous mass late in spermiogenesis. The completely formed acrosomic system is composed of the acrosome and <b>head</b> <b>cap,</b> both enclosed in a continuous unit membrane, and a separated portion of the <b>head</b> <b>cap</b> called the ventral flap running on the antero-ventral part of the head. During spermiogenesis, the acrosome and <b>head</b> <b>cap</b> are formed as distinct morphological entities, and the ventral flap ls split off from the <b>head</b> <b>cap</b> during step 14 of spermiogenesis. Perinuclear material forms adjacent to the nucleus in three areas which eventually become connected. The material of this continuous layer condenses during the last steps 18 and 19 of spermiogenesis to form the perinuclear theca, a continuous layer over the nucleus except around the attachment site of the flagellum...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} 7 days of {{continuous}} capacitive electrical stimulation on bone growth around titanium implants {{placed in the}} tibiae of adult male rats, was evaluated in this study. The animals were 'hooked-up' to an external power supply, emitting a symmetrical sinusoidal wave form with an amplitude of 2. 0 volt p-p and a frequency of 60 kHz. The current values tested were 20 muA, 30 muA and 60 muA. In surgery I, a <b>head</b> <b>cap</b> was affixed to the animal's skull with stainless-steel screws and an acrylic resin. The <b>head</b> <b>cap</b> {{was connected to the}} external power supply by an electrical stimulation wire, encased in a stainless-steel spring. Two electrical leads were subcutaneously tunneled from the <b>head</b> <b>cap</b> to the future tibial implant site, and sutured to the soft tissues. After a one week acclimatization period, a second surgical procedure, surgery II, involved the placement of titanium implants proximal to the tibial tuberosity in each tibiae. Electrodes were then sutured one {{on either side of the}} implant, thus 'cuffing' the implant, and the current was then applied to one implant site with the other acting as a control. After seven days of continuous capacitive electrical stimulation, a biomechanical pull-out test was carried out to measure the force in Newtons (N) of implant extraction.

The victim's head would slowly be crushed, killing the victim, but not before the victim's jaw had been crushed, and their eyes may have possibly extruded from their sockets. To aggravate the pain, the torture master would sometimes amuse himself by tapping on the metal cap with a small hammer. The head crusher was used to extract information from criminals. It would scare them to the point of giving up knowledge that was crucial to solving serious criminal cases.|$|R
