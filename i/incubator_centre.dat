40|$|This {{research}} investigates entrepreneurs from {{a psychological}} perspective, {{with a focus}} on the strategies entrepreneurs use to manage or self-regulate their learning, an area which has largely been ignored in past research with regard to entrepreneurs. The sample consisted of 11 nascent entrepreneurs and new business owners who had started ventures in the sectors of business or consumer services in the last two years. Participants were recruited {{from a variety of sources}} throughout Ireland, including university <b>incubator</b> <b>centres,</b> entrepreneurial network groups, enterprise boards, and information and support services for entrepreneurs. The entrepreneur’s self-regulated learning strategies were assessed using an in-depth, focused interview. Analysis of the results unravelled the complex network of strategies employed by entrepreneurs to manage their learning and knowledge acquisition in the early stages of a new venture. As such, this research demonstrates that entrepreneurial learning is self-regulated, and can be viewed along the dual continuation of: • the level of intentionality of the learning • the level of interaction with other individuals or the environment. Although this research reports on an early-stage, preliminary investigation of a wider study, the examination of the self-regulation of learning and knowledge acquisition can provide valuable insights into the decision-making processes of entrepreneurs and of the process of venture creation more generally...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to identify some of the key issues encountered by tsunami-affected small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the process of rehabilitation and re-establishment in Sri Lanka. The second objective is to assess how far these affected industries have received various benefits and supports from bodies such as government agencies, private sector firms, donors and NGOs to help them get back into business. The final objective is to recommend policies and strategies to develop the tsunami-affected SMEs in a self-sustaining manner and within a certain time period. The main database of firms for this research has been obtained from the Industrial Development Board, which conducted a survey covering 4, 389 tsunami-affected micro- and SMEs. In addition to this, information from various state organizations and NGOs-based sources has been used. This paper identifies the main issues related to tsunami-affected SMEs ranging from basic infrastructure provision up to finance, marketing, machinery, technology, training, product identification and development and so forth. In fact, it is shown that there are no significant differences between issues faced by SMEs in general and tsunami-affected SMEs, apart of course from the effects of a sudden disaster (the tidal wave). Consequently, these issues can be generalized as issues relevant to SMEs in Sri Lanka as a whole. However, under the flood and rain of local and foreign assistance, there have been more pledges and promises than actual deliveries and, so, tsunami-affected SMEs have received comparatively little support and assistance in recovering and no records can be found as to where the colossal amount of foreign assistance received has actually gone. Finally, this paper recommends various types of business <b>incubator</b> <b>centres</b> and entrepreneurial enhancing skill programmes for the revamping of tsunami-affected SMEs in addition to the normal disaster risk management plan...|$|R

40|$|Innovative {{businesses}} {{are often the}} result of collective action of organisations involved in many-sided market structures, {{which can be found}} in and around business <b>incubators</b> or tech¬no¬logy <b>centres.</b> Within such frame environments, many group interests beyond those of single producers and their immediate clients exist and interfere. Rather generically, important economic outcomes of innovations are se¬quen¬ces of cost reduc¬¬tion events at the level of econo¬mic sectors, where the na¬ture of (sector-wise) technology is influencing the pace of these events. At the conceptual le¬vel, we describe the social learning and social innovation process which leads to sustainable in¬no¬¬va¬tion by means of the influence exerted by firms on each other within constrained envi¬ronments such as business incubators. These environments need not to be organized according to any sector logic. We propose that the influ¬ence exerted between firms is increasing in firm simila¬rity, in the degree of product com¬plementarity, and also to depend on (mutual) trust relations.|$|R
30|$|Finally, first practical, {{theoretical}} and empirical research into (i) the adaptation and hybridisation of traditional legal entities (for example, associations, foundations, corporations and other non-profit or for-profit entities) and (ii) the adaptability of novel hybrid legal entities (for example, community interest companies in the UK, benefit corporations in the USA and community contribution companies in Canada) for purposes of legally institutionalising stand-alone intermediary organisations and providing efficient governance solutions for real-world triple helix collaborations (for example, science, technology and innovation parks, research <b>incubators,</b> cooperative research <b>centres,</b> national technology institutes, and national technology and innovation centres). Given the vast variety and diversity of triple helix innovation and wealth maximisation endeavours across the globe {{as well as the}} unique legal organisational design and domicile of each such endeavour (across a similarly varied and diverse spectrum globally), the legal institutionalisation of triple helix organisations should be scrutinised and evaluated in more detail—in particular, as regards the efficiency of their respective decision-making and governance equilibria—in order to support the emergence over time of best practices in the intermediation of ‘innovation in innovation’ (Etzkowitz 2003 a) triple helix projects and to, thus, better understand and control the agency and social costs of such advanced triple helix collaborations.|$|R
40|$|Business Incubation has {{recently}} attracted increased attention {{as a model}} of start-up facilitation. Venture capitalists see incubators as a means to diversify risky investment portfolios, and would-be entrepreneurs approach incubators for start-up support. More than a thousand incubators have been established in the last few years, most of them as regional business incubators. But new types of incubators are emerging. These incubators pursue different strategic objectives, apply different skills and competencies, and serve different markets. As a consequence, they have developed a new understanding of their sources of competitive advantage and business models which are able to satisfy some of the needs of the entrepreneur. Based on the results from some interviews to some entrepreneurs under the Blekinge Business <b>Incubator</b> and the <b>Centre</b> for Advanced Technology Incubator, some of the problems/needs of the entrepreneur were identified. The study also revealed the various activities and support measures provided by the two incubators and further ascertain how effective some of these support has helped improved the businesses of some entrepreneurs in the early stages. The study concludes that though there is other support measures, governments could strengthen incubator and incubations processes as a way to promote entrepreneurial activity within an economy so as to bring economic development. + 452667278...|$|R
40|$|Startups play a {{vital role}} in {{economic}} development, however, have a high rate of failure, partly due to insufficient knowledge resources. A business incubator is an institution aimed to assist startups with services and resources in order to facilitate their development. There is, however, a gap in previous research regarding knowledge flows and acquisition in business incubators. Furthermore, few scholars have conducted research from the startup perspective in this context. This study, therefore, aims to explore how startups acquire knowledge in a business incubator from the perspective of a startup. This has been investigated through a qualitative study of the business <b>incubator</b> Uppsala Innovation <b>Centre</b> where a selection of startups has been interviewed regarding their participation and potential knowledge acquisition. The empirical findings reveal that startups acquire knowledge from several sources e. g. business coaches, other startups; however, the extent of knowledge acquisition and nature of knowledge differs. Most of the knowledge is explicit knowledge acquired through the process of vicarious learning. Overall, the business incubator is argued to fulfill its operations and help startups in their development. This study contributes with needed insights into the business incubator operations from the startup's perspective and expands previous business incubator research by adding a knowledge acquisition perspective...|$|R
40|$|Innovation of Polish {{economy as}} {{assessed}} by international institutions (OECD, EU) {{is below the}} average for EU- 27 although one must note the progress from the group of catching up countries to that of moderate innovators (2010).

Monitoring of innovation indexes for Polish economy does not give a clear-cut picture of the progress made as changes follow different directions. Dynamics of innovation outlays is one among positive symptoms. Businesses operating in Poland allocate more and more resources for innovation. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) constitute the core of Polish economy. They represent 99, 8 % of all economic operators, employ 70, 1 % of the working population, generate 47, 7 % of the GDP and become increasingly active in innovation.

30|$|During {{the process}} on “taking {{the role of}} the other”, {{organisational}} actors in the three sectors have respectively realised that engaging in others’ fields is a necessary but not sufficient condition for achieving the desired goals. In addition, the intra-organisational transformation also causes new challenges and demands within and across sectors. As a solution, they need even closer cooperation and interaction with each other (Etzkowitz 2008). Thus, the third step {{in the development of the}} Triple Helix is the evolution of trilateral interactions between the three sectors, characterised by increasing interdependency between the three spirals: One spiral has a significant influence on the other’s actions, and through the interactions, organisations in each spiral are able to find new ideas from the others to solve problems and meet new needs. For instance, a university’s knowledge production cannot be carried out by itself, but needs industry not only as a source of research problems but also as a strong partner in knowledge production. Meanwhile, university technology transfer is dependent on the conditions or environments created by the government. “The firm is thus transformed from a competitive unit related to other firms solely through the market to a Triple Helix entity increasingly based on relationships with other firms as well as academia and government” (Etzkowitz 2008, p. 58). The interactions also result in the creation of hybrid organisations, such as <b>incubators,</b> joint research <b>centres,</b> science parks, etc. With respect to the third stage, the key institutional logics in Western society are 1) legal protection of intellectual property (IP) and 2) civil society.|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decades, {{evaluation}} {{has become an}} essential tool for policymakers, because it provides unbiased estimates of a policy effect. The purpose of an evaluation is to explore the causal relationship between {{the implementation of a}} policy and its effects – the “impact”. In the programming period 2007 - 2013, the European Commission – and the member States of the EU – have focused their attention on the development of innovation policies within Regional Innovation Systems: for this reason, the innovation policies have been particularly involved in evaluation processes. Six Italian regions have created the Poli di innovazione (Innovation poles), networks of universities, services <b>centres,</b> <b>incubators,</b> public and private laboratories, and enterprises, whose goals are to foster the creation of networks and to stimulate firms’ economic performance through the support in R&D activities. Due to the novelty of the policy, this research is a first attempt to evaluate the Poles, using the Tuscan context as case study. Tuscany Region have supported the creation of twelve poles, facilitating the access to a call for tender for the purchase of R&D qualified services. Using matching and difference-in-differences methods, it has been estimated the Average Treatment on the Treated – in terms of Total Factor Productivity and Labor Productivity – for three possible cases: subsidized SME, SME members of the Poles, subsidized SME members of the Poles. In addition, it has been implemented a model that include network centrality measures to assess the effect of the Poles on the performance of the firms. It emerges that the subsidized firms which belong to the poles experience on average a productivity gain {{towards the end of the}} period of subsidization, and the centrality of their pole have a positive effect, which is particularly relevant for the top enterprises – in terms of productivity...|$|R

Between 2010 and 2012, technological parks were set up in the east, south and north Kazakhstan oblasts (administrative units) and in the capital, Astana. A Centre for Metallurgy was also established in the east Kazakhstan oblast, as well as a Centre for Oil and Gas Technologies which {{will be part of the}} planned Caspian Energy Hub. In addition, the Centre for Technology Commercialization has been set up in Kazakhstan as part of the Parasat National Scientific and Technological Holding, a joint stock company established in 2008 that is 100% state-owned. The centre supports research projects in technology marketing, intellectual property protection, technology licensing contracts and start-ups. The centre plans to conduct a technology audit in Kazakhstan and to review the legal framework regulating the commercialization of research results and technology.Countries are seeking to augment the efficiency of traditional extractive sectors but also to make greater use of information and communication technologies and other modern technologies, such as solar energy, to develop the business sector, education and research. In March 2013, two research institutes were created by presidential decree to foster the development of alternative energy sources in Uzbekistan, with funding from the Asian Development Bank and other institutions: the SPU Physical−Technical Institute (Physics Sun Institute) and the International Solar Energy Institute. Three universities have been set up since 2011 to foster competence in strategic economic areas: Nazarbayev University in Kazakhstan (first intake in 2011), an international research university, Inha University in Uzbekistan (first intake in 2014), specializing in information and communication technologies, and the International Oil and Gas University in Turkmenistan (founded in 2013). Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are both generalizing the teaching of foreign languages at school, in order to facilitate international ties. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have both adopted the three-tier bachelor’s, master’s and PhD degree system, in 2007 and 2012 respectively, which is gradually replacing the Soviet system of Candidates and Doctors of Science. In 2010, Kazakhstan became the only Central Asian member of the Bologna Process, which seeks to harmonize higher education systems in order to create a European Higher Education Area.|$|R
