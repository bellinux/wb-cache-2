The plan works and Tommy knocks out Kane in round seven. After the fight Marty plans to take everyone out for a celebratory dinner but Bob Silver (Paul Raci), a big-time promoter, <b>has</b> <b>watched</b> the fight and, impressed, invites them all out. Marty declines and goes home, but later that night is taken to the hospital. Tommy rushes {{to the hospital and}} finds Diane there. He asks if Marty is in the hospital because of what happened at the cabin. Diane tells him that when Marty was a fighter, people threatened to expose Marty's homosexuality, so he ended his career by putting his hand through a window and damaging it. He became a teacher and his influence led Diane to make herself a success. When Marty is released, Tommy moves in with him temporarily to help him recuperate.|$|E

This city district was founded by Quakers William Shipley and Thomas West in the early 18th century. The nearby Meeting House keeps Quaker Hill closely tied to its rich history.

Énée {{interpret}}s this {{as a sign of}} the goddess Athene's anger at the sacrilege. Against Cassandre's futile protests, Priam orders the horse to be brought within the city of Troy and placed next to the temple of Pallas Athene. There is a sound of what seems to be the clashing of arms from within the horse, but the Trojans, in their delusion, interpret it as a happy omen. Cassandre <b>has</b> <b>watched</b> the procession in despair, and as the act ends, resigns herself to death beneath the walls of Troy.|$|E
500|$|Degrassi: The Next Generation has {{received}} generally positive reviews.

Susanna tries to find love, but six of her seven husbands have a flaw which proves fatal. The killings (and her yearning for love) are {{explained}} by the loss of her mother at a young age. The story is told by a young forensic pathologist, Arun (Vivaan Shah), to his wife, Nandini (Konkona Sen Sharma). Arun <b>has</b> <b>watched</b> Susanna since their childhood, and has a secret crush on her. He owes his life to her; she funded his education, making him what he is today.

500|$|The {{series has}} {{attracted}} many celebrities. Robert Downey, Jr. telephoned the show production staff {{and asked if}} he could produce or assist in an episode's creation, as his son is a fan of the show; the producers subsequently created a character for Downey. Lauren Conrad met MacFarlane while recording a [...] clip for the episode [...] "Prick Up Your Ears" [...] (season 5, 2006). She <b>has</b> <b>watched</b> Family Guy for years and considers Stewie her favorite character. Commenting on his appearance in the episode [...] "Big Man on Hippocampus" [...] (season 8, 2010), actor Dwayne Johnson stated that he was a [...] "big fan" [...] of Family Guy. Johnson befriended MacFarlane after he had a minor role in Johnson's 2010 film Tooth Fairy. R singer Rihanna has admitted to being a fan of Family Guy, as has pop singer Britney Spears; she tries to imitate Stewie's English accent. Spears, who was mocked for her personal problems in the South Park episode [...] "Britney's New Look" [...] in 2008, offered to appear in a cameo to hit back at the similar animated show, but MacFarlane declined, stating {{that he did not want}} to start a feud with the series.|$|E
500|$|Nineteen months later, Jim is {{a famous}} actor playing {{the title role}} in Richard III at the theatre, using the same, now redecorated, {{dressing}} room. A paralysed Tony comes backstage to visit him and talks about how far Jim's career has come. Jim broke up with Laura and has not seen her since his run in Macbeth. After Tony leaves, Kirstie arrives to see Jim. She is now Tony's full-time carer. She <b>has</b> <b>watched</b> Jim's performance {{every day of the}} week, and says she knew that he just needed [...] "a little push" [...] to achieve greatness. She tells him that Laura committed suicide by slitting her wrists in the dressing room's shower. Jim did not know about this, because he was overseas filming a role in Game of Thrones at the time. He believes that Laura pushed Tony off the battlements and could not live with her guilt. Kirstie reveals that she herself is the one who pushed Tony, and spiked his juice with alcohol backstage. She also got Felicity sacked because Felicity would not let Jim perform as Macbeth. Kirstie is wearing the engagement ring that she took from Laura's corpse. She tells Jim that she is waiting for him [...] "in the wings ... like an understudy". She leaves, and as Jim prepares to go onstage, he sees bloody visions of Laura's death.|$|E
500|$|Don't Look Now {{has been}} much admired by and an {{influence}} on subsequent filmmakers. [...] Danny Boyle cites Nicolas Roeg as a key influence on his work and counts it amongst his favourite films. Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton, Reece Shearsmith, and Jeremy Dyson drew upon Don't Look Now considerably for their television series The League of Gentlemen; Pemberton ranks it among the top three British horror films of the 1960s and 1970s, and says that he wants things he has written to make audiences feel the way he felt when he watched The Wicker Man and Don't Look Now. Similarly, Ryan Murphy considers his TV series American Horror Story to be a throwback to '60s and '70s psychological horror, citing Don't Look Now, Rosemary's Baby and The Shining as particular examples. Thematic and narrative similarities with Lars von Trier's Antichrist have also been observed, with Antichrist's cinematographer, Anthony Dod Mantle, commenting that he <b>has</b> <b>watched</b> Don't Look Now more times than any other film. Fabrice Du Welz, whose film Vinyan has often been compared to Don't Look Now, has stated {{that it is a}} film he is [...] "obsessed with", and one of his favourites, while Lynne Ramsay cited it as an influence on We Need to Talk about Kevin, which incidentally is also produced by Roeg's son, Luc. Ami Canaan Mann has also acknowledged she was influenced by atmospheric thrillers such as Picnic at Hanging Rock and Don't Look Now while directing her debut feature, Texas Killing Fields.|$|E

500|$|An {{official}} {{synopsis of}} the film was published in The Moving Picture World states: [...] "Jack Thorne, a young artist, finds his efforts unappreciated, {{and he and his}} wife and little daughter {{are on the verge of}} starvation. The final blow comes when his last painting, on which he had built much hope, was rejected by a rich man, whom an artist chum kindly brought to the impoverished studio. Jack decides that he can struggle no longer. Unseen by his wife, he picks up his revolver, puts it in his pocket and goes out, intending to end everything. But his little daughter <b>has</b> <b>watched</b> him; she follows him and stays his hand. Her prayers and entreaties bring him to a realization of what his rash act would mean to the two helpless ones that would be left behind. Penitent and remorseful, he accompanies his child back to their poor home. There he confesses to his wife that it was only the child's timely interference that saved him from ending it all. The mother drops on her knees beside her child, and clasping her in her arms, raises grateful eyes to Heaven in a prayer of thankfulness. Jack, looking up suddenly, sees the beautiful group of mother and child, with a light as if from Heaven upon them. Realizing that [...] is the inspiration and subject for which he has sought in vain, he calls for them not to move, and at once begins his great painting of them, which brings him fame and wealth." ...|$|E
500|$|Other {{critics were}} less {{enthusiastic}} about the season, though. The Seattle Times Melanie McFarland was unsure whether the series' success in Canada would follow when it began airing in the US. [...] "As popular as Degrassi was, {{it was still a}} mere cult hit in the United States; the crowd that had access to it initially on PBS {{might not be able to}} tune into [...] Soft-pedaling through the issues might work for today's family of viewers, but what's gentle enough for Mom and Dad's peace of mind might not be enough to hook Junior or the original Degrassi's older fans". She was, however, [...] "happy [...] chose Degrassi students to navigate teen perils instead of digging up Screech and the gang for another nauseating go-round". Tony Atherton of the Ottawa Citizen had mixed feelings of the new incarnation, saying it [...] "has a cleaner, more polished look, has lost its edge [...] nothing new to viewers familiar with the groundbreaking preceding series, nor to anyone else who <b>has</b> <b>watched</b> the deluge of teen dramas since", adding that because there is [...] "little ground left to break in teen drama there is a sense of déjà vu with regards to the plots and characters". He did, however, praise the show for having [...] "the same simple narrative told from a kid's viewpoint, and the same regard for unvarnished reality [...] light years from far-fetched high-school melodramas like Boston Public and Dawson's Creek [...] is every bit as good as its beloved predecessor. In fact, in some respects it is even better". After watching nearly seventy hours of twenty-one Canadian-produced programs, the Simon Fraser University cited Degrassi: The Next Generation in their report as one of the Canadian television programmes that is [...] "too Caucasian".|$|E
500|$|Bridges' view of [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] {{was taken}} up by H. W. Garrod in his 1926 {{analysis}} of Keats's poems. As Albert Gerard would argue later in 1944, Garrod believed that the problem within Keats's poem was his emphasis on the rhythm and the language instead of the main ideas of the poem. When describing the fourth stanza of the poem, Maurice Ridley, in 1933, claimed, [...] "And so comes the stanza, with that remarkable piece of imagination at the end which feels the light as blown by the breezes, one of those characteristic sudden flashes with which Keats fires the most ordinary material." [...] He later declared of the seventh stanza: [...] "And now for the great stanza in which the imagination is fanned to yet whiter heat, the stanza that would, I suppose, by common consent be taken, along with Kubla Khan, as offering us the distilled sorceries of 'Romanticism'". He concluded on the stanza that [...] "I {{do not believe that}} any reader who <b>has</b> <b>watched</b> Keats at work on the more exquisitely finished of the stanzas in The Eve of St. Agnes, and seen this craftsman slowly elaborating and refining, will ever believe that this perfect stanza was achieved with the easy fluency with which, in the draft we have, it was obviously written down." [...] In 1936, F. R. Leavis wrote, [...] "One remembers the poem both as recording, and as being for the reader, an indulgence." [...] Following Leavis, Cleanth Brooks and Robert Penn Warren, in a 1938 essay, saw the poem as [...] "a very rich poem. It contains some complications which we must not gloss over if we are to appreciate the depth and significance of the issues engaged." [...] Brooks would later argue in The Well-Wrought Urn (1947) that the poem was thematically unified while contradicting many of the negative criticisms lodged against the poem.|$|E
