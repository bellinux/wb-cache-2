5|$|At the <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> {{the linear}} {{chromosomes}} are specialized regions of DNA called telomeres. The main function of these regions {{is to allow}} the cell to replicate chromosome ends using the enzyme telomerase, as the enzymes that normally replicate DNA cannot copy the extreme 3′ <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> chromosomes. These specialized chromosome caps also help protect the DNA ends, and stop the DNA repair systems in the cell from treating them as damage to be corrected. In human cells, telomeres are usually lengths of single-stranded DNA containing several thousand repeats of a simple TTAGGG sequence.|$|E

5|$|RNA-dependent DNA polymerases are a {{specialized}} class of polymerases that copy {{the sequence of}} an RNA strand into DNA. They include reverse transcriptase, which is a viral enzyme involved in the infection of cells by retroviruses, and telomerase, which {{is required for the}} replication of telomeres. For example, HIV reverse transcriptase is an enzyme for AIDS virus replication. Telomerase is an unusual polymerase because it contains its own RNA template as part of its structure. It synthesizes telomeres at the <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> chromosomes. Telomeres prevent fusion of the <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> neighboring chromosomes and protect chromosome ends from damage.|$|E
