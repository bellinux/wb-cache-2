5|$|Utilitarianism {{is a type}} of consequentialist ethical theory. According to such theories, {{only the}} outcome of an action <b>is</b> <b>morally</b> {{relevant}} (this contrasts with deontology, according to which moral actions flow from duties or motives). Utilitarianism is a combination of consequentialism and the philosophical position hedonism, which states that pleasure, or happiness, is the only good worth pursuing. Therefore, since only the consequences of an action matter, and only happiness matters, only happiness that is the consequence of an action <b>is</b> <b>morally</b> relevant. There are similarities with preference utilitarianism, where utility is defined as individual preference rather than pleasure.|$|E
5|$|Kant {{argued that}} {{rational}} beings {{can never be}} treated merely as means to ends; they must always also be treated as ends themselves, requiring that their own reasoned motives must be equally respected. This derives from Kant's claim that reason motivates morality: it demands that we respect reason as a motive in all beings, including other people. A rational being cannot rationally consent to being used merely {{as a means to}} an end, so they must always be treated as an end. Kant justified this by arguing that moral obligation is a rational necessity: that which is rationally willed <b>is</b> <b>morally</b> right. Because all rational agents rationally will themselves to be an end and never merely a means, it <b>is</b> <b>morally</b> obligatory that they are treated as such. This {{does not mean that we}} can never treat a human as a means to an end, but that when we do, we also treat him as an end in himself.|$|E
5|$|In Stage four (authority {{and social}} order {{obedience}} driven), {{it is important}} to obey laws, dictums, and social conventions because of their importance in maintaining a functioning society. Moral reasoning in stage four is thus beyond the need for individual approval exhibited in stage three. A central ideal or ideals often prescribe what is right and wrong. If one person violates a law, perhaps everyone would—thus there is an obligation and a duty to uphold laws and rules. When someone does violate a law, it <b>is</b> <b>morally</b> wrong; culpability is thus a significant factor in this stage as it separates the bad domains from the good ones. Most active members of society remain at stage four, where morality is still predominantly dictated by an outside force.|$|E

5|$|Since the 18th century, {{people have}} become {{increasingly}} concerned about the welfare of farm animals. Possible measures of welfare include longevity, behavior, physiology, reproduction, freedom from disease, and freedom from immunosuppression. Standards and laws for animal welfare have been created worldwide, broadly {{in line with the}} most widely held position in the western world, a form of utilitarianism: that it <b>is</b> <b>morally</b> acceptable for humans to use non-human animals, provided that no unnecessary suffering is caused, and that the benefits to humans outweigh the costs to the livestock. An opposing view is that animals have rights, should not be regarded as property, and should never be used by humans.|$|E
5|$|Various {{forms of}} divine command theory have been {{presented}} by philosophers including William of Ockham, St Augustine, Duns Scotus, and John Calvin. The theory generally teaches that moral truth does not exist independently of God and that morality is determined by divine commands. Stronger versions of the theory assert that God's command is {{the only reason that}} a good action is moral, while weaker variations cast divine command as a vital component within a greater reason. The theory asserts that good actions are morally good {{as a result of their}} being commanded by God, and many religious believers subscribe to some form of divine command theory. Because of these premises, adherents believe that moral obligation is obedience to God's commands; what <b>is</b> <b>morally</b> right is what God desires.|$|E

25|$|Thomist ethics {{hold that}} it is {{necessary}} to observe both circumstances and intention to determine an action's moral value, and therefore Aquinas cannot be said to be strictly either a deontologicalist or a consequentialist. Rather, he would say that an action <b>is</b> <b>morally</b> good if it fulfills God's antecedent will.|$|E

25|$|Some pacifists follow {{principles}} of nonviolence, believing that nonviolent action <b>is</b> <b>morally</b> superior and/or most effective. Some however, support physical violence for emergency defence of self or others.

25|$|The {{concept of}} {{forgiveness}} is inconsistently treated in extensive debates of Hindu literature. In some Hindu texts, certain sins and intentional acts are debated as naturally unforgivable; for example, murder and rape; these ancient scholars argue whether blanket forgiveness <b>is</b> <b>morally</b> justifiable in every circumstance, and whether forgiveness encourages crime, disrespect, social disorder and people not taking you seriously. Other ancient Hindu texts highlight that forgiveness is not same as reconciliation.|$|E
25|$|The {{indigenous}} population of New Zealand also have strong views regarding organ donation. Many Maori people believe organ donation <b>is</b> <b>morally</b> unacceptable {{due to the}} cultural need for a dead body to remain fully intact. However, because {{there is not a}} universally recognised cultural authority, no one view on organ donation is universally accepted in the Maori population. They are, however, less likely to accept a kidney transplant than other New Zealanders, despite being overrepresented in the population receiving dialysis.|$|E

25|$|Despard has atoned for his {{previous}} {{ten years of}} evil acts and has married Mad Margaret. The two of them now live a calm, dispassionate life of moderately-paid public service. They come to the castle and urge Robin to renounce his life of crime.

Realising the extent of his guilt, Robin resolves to defy his ancestors.|$|E
25|$|When Hermes {{discovers the}} Professor's fate, he shows Leela the Professor's video will, which shows Leela kicking {{him into the}} {{anteater}} pit. Leela kills Hermes {{to cover up the}} first murder. Later, Bender walks in on Leela while she is getting rid of Hermes' body parts in the sink disposal. He <b>is</b> <b>morally</b> unconcerned, but takes the opportunity to blackmail Leela. She kills Bender by exposing him to the radiation from an open microwave oven and turns his body into a toy car. Amy makes a derisive comment about her new Go-kart (Bender), and Leela promptly murders her as well.|$|E
25|$|He {{extensively}} discusses playwright Molière's work, {{and uses}} the play Le Misanthrope to exemplify a comedy in which the audience derives immoral pleasure. In the play, the main character, Alceste, is good and honest in his relationships with men and made to look ridiculous, whereas Philinte, a deceiver and manipulator, is shown as superior. Rousseau considers this play to be a work of genius, but it is, of course, morally backwards. He reasons that even if comedy writers write a play that <b>is</b> <b>morally</b> acceptable, the audience will not find it funny. Therefore, theatres are of little use.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I attempt answer the {{question}} why things matter, i. e. why things <b>are</b> <b>morally</b> significant. I argue that one answer would be that things <b>are</b> <b>morally</b> significant because they embody values and interests which enrol us into particular programmes of action (as argued by Winner and ANT theorists). I suggest {{that this is a}} good and important provisional answer but argue that we need to move beyond an anthropocentric view of things by asking why things <b>are</b> <b>morally</b> significant as such. I proceed to use the work of Heidegger to argue that things are significant because they ‘world’. I draw on this analysis to present some suggestions towards an ethics of things...|$|R
40|$|It is {{plausible}} {{to think that}} there exist acts of supererogation (acts that <b>are</b> <b>morally</b> optional and morally better than the minimum that morality demands). It also seems plausible that there is a close connection between what we <b>are</b> <b>morally</b> required to do and what it would <b>be</b> <b>morally</b> good to do. Despite being independently plausible these two claims are hard to reconcile. My aim in this paper will be to respond to a recent solution to this puzzle proposed by Dale Dorsey (2013). Dorsey’s solution to this problem is to posit a new account of supererogation. I will argue that Dorsey’s account fails to succeed in achieving what an account of supererogation is supposed to achieve...|$|R

25|$|Similarly, Emanuel {{argues that}} there are four major {{arguments}} presented by opponents of euthanasia: a) not all deaths are painful; b) alternatives, such as cessation of active treatment, combined {{with the use of}} effective pain relief, are available; c) the distinction between active and passive euthanasia <b>is</b> <b>morally</b> significant; and d) legalising euthanasia will place society on a slippery slope, which will lead to unacceptable consequences. In fact, in Oregon, in 2013, pain wasn't one of the top five reasons people sought euthanasia. Top reasons were a loss of dignity, and a fear of burdening others.|$|E
25|$|A {{more recent}} survey {{carried out in}} October 2008 by The Observer affirmed that a small {{majority}} of Britons – 55% – support gay marriage. A 2013 poll shows {{that the majority of}} the Irish public support gay marriage and gay adoption, 73% and 60% respectively. France has support for same sex marriage at 62%, and Russian at 14%. Italy has support for the 'Civil Partnership Law' between gays at 45% with 47% opposed. In 2009 58.9% of Italians supported civil unions, while a 40.4% minority supported same-sex marriage. In 2010, 63.9% of Greeks supported same-sex partnerships, while a 38.5% minority supported same-sex marriage. In 2012 a poll by MaltaToday showed that 41% of Maltese supported same sex marriage, with support increasing to 60% amongst the 18-35 age group. In a 2013 opinion poll conducted by CBOS, 65% of Poles were against same-sex civil unions, 72% of Poles were against same-sex marriage, 88% were against adoption by same-sex couples, and 68% were against gays and lesbians publicly showing their way of life. In Croatia, a poll from November 2013 revealed that 59% of Croats think that marriage should be constitutionally defined as a union between a man and a woman, while 31% do not agree with the idea. A CBOS opinion poll from February 2014 found that 70% of Poles believe same-sex sexual activity <b>is</b> <b>morally</b> unacceptable, while only 22% believed it <b>is</b> <b>morally</b> acceptable.|$|E
25|$|The Democratic Party opposes {{attempts}} {{to reverse the}} 1973 Supreme Court decision Roe v.

Casey, which lays out the legal framework in which government action alleged to violate that right is assessed by courts. As {{a matter of the}} right to privacy and of gender equality, many Democrats believe all women should have the ability to choose to abort without governmental interference. They believe that each woman, conferring with her conscience, has the right to choose for herself whether abortion <b>is</b> <b>morally</b> correct.|$|E
