40|$|<b>Ending</b> <b>stocks</b> play an {{important}} role in decision making by market participants and policy makers. The provision of accurate forecasts of <b>ending</b> <b>stocks</b> is critical as it can timely reflect the market situation and reduce the uncertainty faced by decision makers. Over the years, the USDA and private analysts have been providing <b>ending</b> <b>stocks</b> forecasts. However, few studies have addressed USDA forecasts, and researchers have not investigated analysts’ forecasts so far. This dissertation focuses on analyzing the <b>ending</b> <b>stocks</b> forecasts issued by these two sources. It contains three essays which gradually delve into the USDA and private analysts’ forecasting behaviors. The first essay advances existing models and analyze USDA forecasts. The proposed model focuses on forecast revisions and retains the link between forecasts and the <b>ending</b> <b>stocks.</b> The essay also introduces an error covariance structure specifically for <b>ending</b> <b>stocks</b> forecasts. The model is estimated using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Results show that USDA forecasts are inefficient. Given this finding, the model is applied to private analysts’ forecasts to find whether analysts can provide “better” forecasts. This part of analysis is performed in the second essay. Unlike USDA forecasts, analysts’ forecasts are often incomplete. Thus, Essay Two first investigates analysts’ forecasts as a group by combining them to create complete forecast data, and then proposes a method of integrating multiple imputation and MCMC estimations to analyze individual analysts’ forecasts. Results show that analysts, as a group, are inefficient in making <b>ending</b> <b>stocks</b> forecasts. Besides, forecasting behavior vary across individual analysts. Essay Two also finds that analysts and the USDA have similar behavior in forecasting corn and soybeans <b>ending</b> <b>stocks.</b> Thus, it is possible that their forecasts affect each other. Hence, essay three proposes a method to analyze the forecasts from these two sources together, utilizing the overlooked the information in previous studies. Results show that analysts actually forecast the USDA forecasts instead of the <b>ending</b> <b>stocks.</b> The proposed models and methods are designed for general purposes. Thus, they can be easily extended by including additional features, as well as can be applied to other fixed-events...|$|R

30|$|The {{firm level}} control {{variables}} include firm size, {{return on assets}} (ROA), MTB ratio, stock turnover and leverage. Firm size is measured using the logarithm of total assets. ROA is the return on assets calculated as earnings per share scaled by year <b>end</b> <b>stock</b> price. MTB is the market to book ratio calculated as market capitalization divided by book value of total assets. Leverage is total liabilities over total assets. Stock turnover is the yearly trading volume divided by market capitalization. Although stock turnover could {{be considered as a}} proxy for information asymmetry, it also includes other impacts in additional to liquidity. For example, information asymmetry impacts liquidity and turnover but turnover can also directly impact liquidity if investors have different expectations on information available. In any case, turnover is not a standard information asymmetry proxy used in past literature (Fu et al. 2012). As the firms come from very different industries such as oil & gas, basic materials, industrials, consumer goods, health care, consumer services, telecommunications, utilities, financials and technology etc., firm fixed effects are also incorporated into the results.|$|E

The results however, revealed {{that out of the}} four companies, only two companies’ stock prices were predicted by volatility in their stock prices, while past stock prices predicted current stock prices implying that the market does not follow a random walk. As a result of these, it is recommended that activities of corporate insiders should be properly checked, to reduce the predictability of stock prices, information should be known and made public to all investors. Also policy makers are advised to review their economic policies and should be careful in their use of the Nigerian bourse as a barometer to reflect performance in the general economy as our findings suggests that this could be misleading. <br /...|$|E

30|$|The {{numerical}} {{methods for}} solving the Black–Scholes equation {{have been presented}} in many scholarly studies. The binomial process and probability for formula valuation of option pricing are proposed by Cox et al. The {{rate of return on}} the stock over each period can have two possible values and the <b>end</b> <b>stock</b> price of maturity will be either us or ds (Cox et al. 1979). Moon and Kim use an adaptive averaging binomial method for option valuation (Moon and Kim 2013). The symmetrical lattice for real options valuation are presented by Bastian-Pinto (2015). Glazyrina and Melnikov presented an alternative derivation of the Black–Scholes formula from a binomial option pricing model (Glazyrina and Melnikov 2016). The finite difference method by Schwartz developed the numerical solution for valuing options on dividend-paying stocks. The boundary condition is enforced {{to take into account the}} fact that the stock price will drop by the amount of the dividend (Schwartz 1977). A numerical upwind scheme for solving the backward time parabolic partial differential equation is proffered by Vazquez (1998). A robust finite difference method for pricing European and American options is presented by Cen and Le (2010, 2011). Cen et al. introduced a central difference scheme with moving mesh in the spatial discretization for pricing Asian options (Cen et al. 2013). Lesmana and Wang purposed an upwind finite difference method for a nonlinear Black–Scholes equation (Lesmana and Wang 2013). The uniform cubic B-spline collocation method is implemented to find the numerical solution by a horizontal method of lines, to discretize the temporal variable and the spatial variable (Kadalbajoo et al. 2012).|$|E

40|$|Two very {{important}} benchmarks {{in the development}} of a marketing strategy are the variable and fixed costs of production. Every farmer has costs of production that are unique to their particular farm. Accurately identifying the costs of production or break even costs for the various crop enterprises is important. Also important is the analysis of revenues and costs across the spectrum of various acreage allocations, yields, and market prices. A computer program in an EXCEL spreadsheet format has been developed to facilitate the identification of the costs of production and the financial impact of various yields, market prices and acreage allocations. A second concern {{in the development of}} a marketing plan is the determination of reasonable price expectations given historical prices and current supply and demand estimates.
