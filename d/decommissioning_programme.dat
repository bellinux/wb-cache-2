40|$|<b>Decommissioning</b> <b>programmes</b> {{have been}} used in many {{countries}} in an attempt to reduce the level of overexploitation in fisheries. The extent to which human capital enhancement may offset capacity reductions, however, has not been previously examined. The study uses a stochastic production frontier model to estimate the impact of differing skipper, vessel and technology characteristics on the productivity of a set of UK trawlers operating in the English Channel. The results suggest that productivity improvements resulting from increased education and training could exceed those from increased technological adoption. Increased investment in human capital enhancement could potentially offset, at least to some degree, the effects of decommissioning in the fishery. The study highlights an apparent oversight in fisheries policy analysis. Considerable attention is paid to the potential problem of technological creep and input substitution. However, enhancing human capital may have a greater impact on stocks than technological adoption in established fisheries...|$|R

40|$|The {{decommissioning}} of {{installations in}} the North Sea {{is a relative}} new market that will be developed {{in the near future}} due to the amount of platforms built since 1970 ’s. The intent of this document is to review the different technical aspects of <b>decommissioning</b> <b>programmes</b> in several fields looking for their outcomes and recommendations to compile the challenges that these face. Smaller tasks performed during the decommissioning can be grouped in categories such as well plug and abandonment (P&A), subsea and pipeline decommissioning, topsides and structures decommissioning being steel or concrete the principal construction material; and finally disposal of the removed items (Tularak, et al., 2007). Therefore, the fact that all platforms face unique design conditions then challenges to overcome them may be different. Removing the completion, plugging permeable zones, and removing the wellhead have their challenges such as creating a seal that isolates permanently several zones on the reservoir. Pipeline decommissioning presents the challenge of develop a method to retrieve the material in a safe and economical way; but, the inherent uncertainty of pipeline’s structural integrity had played an important role on companies, making them choose an alternative option which is leave in place the buried pipelines. Topside and jacket removal has its biggest challenges in the engineering –economic balance,reuse possibilities, disassembly methods, onshore transport, and disposal. All of these make a big impact not only on risk and environmental aspects but also on the expenditure required. Furthermore, safety concerns under incomplete tasks during the decommissioning face the challenge of creating a sound cut with minimal environmental impact and without affecting future regional activities but more importantly without exposing personnel to perils. Management of drill cuttings during drilling activities has given good results when the option of leaving them on the sea bed for natural degradation is chosen, but the challenge of a more environmental friendly disposal is a constant in the industry...|$|R

40|$|With the ageing {{of nuclear}} {{facilities}} or the reduced {{interest in their}} further operation, {{a new set of}} problems, related to the decommissioning of these facilities, has come into forefront. In many cases {{it turns out that the}} preparations for decommissioning have come too late, and that financial resources for covering decommissioning activities have not been provided. To avoid such problems, future liailities should be thoroughly estimated in drawing up the decommissioning and waste management programme for each nuclear facility in time, and financial provisions for implementing such programme should be provided.

Further, there is potential for harvesting capacity to increase if remaining vessels improve their efficiency. <b>Decommissioning</b> Multi-Annual Guidance <b>Programme</b> Technical efficiency Capacity reduction...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear <b>Decommissioning</b> Projects and <b>Programmes</b> (NDPs) are jeopardized {{by several}} risks, long {{schedule}} and cost estimates that {{lay in the}} range of hundreds of billions of pounds. Moreover, in some countries, these estimates keep increasing and key stakeholders have a limited understanding of the determinants that engender this phenomena. Benchmarking refers to the process of comparing projects in order to identify best practices and generate ideas for improvement. However, even if it is the envisaged approach to tackle the decommissioning challenges (and due to the NDPs’ uniqueness), until now, benchmarking has been only partially used. This paper proposes an innovative methodology to benchmark decommissioning projects, both from the nuclear and non-nuclear industry, within the UK and worldwide. From this cross-sectorial and cross-country analysis, it is possible to gather a list of key NDPs’ characteristic and statistically test their correlation with the project performance. The ultimate aim of the research underpinning this paper is to investigate the possible causation between the NDPs’ characteristics and the NDPs’ performance and to develop guidelines to improve the selection, planning and delivery of future NDPs...|$|R
40|$|Project {{management}} literature has, until now, {{mainly focused}} on new build {{and only in}} the last decades the issues of decommissioning (mega) projects has arisen. To respond to this changing environment, project management will need to understand the challenges of decommissioning projects. Decommissioning projects within Oil & Gas, Chemical and Nuclear sectors are characterized by high costs, long schedules and uncertainty-based risks. The budget for Nuclear <b>Decommissioning</b> Projects and <b>Programmes</b> (NDPs) are subject to well publicized increases and, due to their relatively recent emergence, complexity and variety, key stakeholders lack a full understanding of the key factors influencing these increases. Benchmarking involves “comparing actual or planned practices [ [...] . ] to identify best practices, generate ideas for improvement” and offers significant potential to improve the performance of project selection, planning and delivery. However, even if benchmarking is the envisaged methodology to investigate the NDPs characteristics that impact on the NDPs performance, until now, it has only been partially used and there is a huge gap in the literature concerning benchmarking NDPs. This paper adapts a top-down benchmarking approach to highlight the NDPs characteristics that mostly impact on the NDPs performance. This is exemplified by a systematic quantitative and qualitative cross-comparison of two major “similar-but-different” NDPs: Rocky Flats (US) and Sellafield (UK). Main results concern the understanding of the alternatives of the owner and/or the contractors in relation to (1) the physical characteristics and the end state of the nuclear site, (2) the governance, funding & contracting schemes, and (3) the stakeholders’ engagement...|$|R
40|$|Synopsis Modern {{geological}} {{data have}} produced an evolving {{picture of the}} complexity of the Dounreay nuclear site and the impacts that past and ongoing environmental changes have on its safe restoration. Techniques ranging from the dating diatom assemblages in present-day salt marshes, to establish past sea-levels; correlating Devonian fish fossils and spore zones in the Caithness flagstones; identifying heavy mineral suites in sandstones, and even counting the number of Orcadian lake cycles preserved in borehole cores, all help bring the picture into focus. The BGS work is part of a much wider programme that makes the Dounreay site area perhaps the most intensively studied patch of ground in the Scottish Highlands. It has informed the plans for decommissioning past disposal facilities and the design and location of new long-term storage. The <b>decommissioning</b> <b>programme</b> is taking about 30 years; the new geological perspective is needed because successful decommissioning must restore the environment at Dounreay for the next 100 000 years. ...|$|E
40|$|Graphite {{has been}} used {{extensively}} in UK reactors since the 1950 s. The UK nuclear <b>decommissioning</b> <b>programme</b> will result in some 90, 000 tonnes of waste graphite being removed from Magnox, AGR, research reactors and plutonium production reactors. It is necessary to understand the radiological characteristics of reactor graphite as a prerequisite for decisions about its interim management as well as final disposition. There is in particular a need to improve confidence in the disposal inventory of the long-lived radionuclides carbon- 14 and chlorine- 36. Models {{have been developed to}} predict the distribution of principal radionuclides for Chapelcross reactor 1 and Wylfa reactor 1, and the calculated inventory compared with published experimental measurements on active samples. The models show good agreement with experimental values for carbon- 14 and cobalt- 60. However, for the highly mobile and volatile radionuclides chlorine- 36 and tritium agreement is poor. The models provide a crude upper limit on the inventory, but certain radionuclides may be released during irradiation. For Wylfa it is predicted that all graphite waste arisings will be ILW. For Chapelcross of the order of 16...|$|E
40|$|An {{intensive}} <b>decommissioning</b> <b>programme</b> at SCK•CEN {{was executed}} {{during the period}} 1989 to 1998. This programme included the decommissioning of the BR 3 reactor and heavy equipment in the BR 2 reactor {{as well as the}} clean up of several nuclear laboratories. The management of these Dismantling and Decontamination activities (D&D) along with the evaluation of the costs and the financing of the liability fund requires the use of a data processing system. SCK•CEN designed in 1994 a decommissioning management tool (DEMATO) to perform these assignments. The tool was successfully used in 1995 for the set-up of the decommissioning plan and in 1999, to perform its revision. The comparison between these two successive evaluations allows to observe the influence of changes in strategy and the evolution of waste prices on the costs of the D&D activities and this for the period 1995 - 1998. As a result of this exercise one notices that: 1. for the back end of the HEU BR 2 spent fuel, the processing of the spent fuel without recovery of the uranium, allows to reduce the costs by 25 %; 2. the dry storage of the LEU and MOX spent fuel is, up to now, performed within the dedicated budget; 3. the costs of the other D&D activities are roughly 5 % more expensive that the estimated budget, if the increase of the waste costs is disregarded and 15 % of the inflation of the waste costs is taken into account...|$|E
40|$|The 6. 5 MW {{heavy water}} moderated and cooled {{research}} reactor "RA" {{located at the}} Vinca Institute of Nuclear Sciences near Belgrade in Serbia, was in operation from 1959 until 1984. In 2002, the Serbian government decided to decommission the RA reactor and its ancillary facilities, and set up for that purpose the Vinca Institute Nuclear <b>Decommissioning</b> (VIND) <b>programme</b> / 1 /. According to the decommissioning plan for the RA reactor, the first activity was the removal of fresh and spent reactor fuel. The fresh fuel, containing 48 kg of highly enriched uranium in about 5000 fuel elements, was repatriated to the Russian Federation in 2002 {{as a result of}} a joint project between the Serbian government, the USA, the Russian Federation and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) / 2 /. The removal of about 2500 kg of spent fuel is currently ongoing and comprises a number of coherent actions starting from the removal of spent fuel from spent fuel storage facility and reactor core, the packaging into proper shielding and transport containers and the final repatriation to the Russian Federation. The second action within the VIND <b>programme</b> is the <b>decommissioning</b> of the RA reactor. Besides the development of the decommissioning plan and the full radiological characterisation of the facility, several experimental facilities and supporting equipment have been dismantled and processed as radioactive waste during the preparatory phase for spent fuel removal. Further decommissioning steps will include the decontamination of the empty spent fuel pool, the dismantling of the remaining reactor supporting systems, internals and core shielding with the subsequent decontamination and eventual dismantling of the reactor tank. The final decision of the Government of the Republic of Serbia on the decommissioning or future use of the reactor concrete vessel and the reactor building has not been done yet. The third principal action that is being implemented within VIND programme is establishing and equipping appropriate and modern facilities for processing the historical waste from former Yugoslavian nuclear programme that has been improperly stored at the site in unsafe conditions. The facility will be used for retrieving waste from old waste storage facilities and for processing of all kinds of radioactive waste, generated in decommissioning activities. As a part of this action, a new surface storage facility (storage building) for processed waste and disused sealed sources has been recently completed next to the waste processing facility and is expected to be ready in 2010 to accept the waste packages. In parallel, a radiation protection infrastructure is being set up and equipped to ensure the safety of all decommissioning and waste handling operations. As a result of the recent promulgation of a new Law on Ionizing Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety in Serbia in May 2009, two new organizations, playing a key-role in the implementation of the VIND programme, have been established: the Agency for Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety of Serbia (ARPNSS) and the Public Company "Nuclear Facilities in Serbia" (PC NFS). The latter will take the responsibility for management of entire VIND project and for the implementation of the Serbian part of all decommissioning activities at the Vinca site. It should be also underlined that without external aid from several countries (USA, UK) and international organisations (Nuclear Threat Initiative, IAEA and the European Commission), the VIND programme would have faced important problems of funding.

40|$|In {{the period}} of investigation, 1995 â€“ 2000, the Danish fishery for species meant for human {{consumption}} was managed by individual non-transferable vessel quotas, while the fishery for species meant for fishmeal and fish oil was subject to a total quota. The revenues of the fishermen targeting species for human consumption are therefore fixed {{on the assumption that}} they are price takers, and that they will maximize profits by minimizing their costs. To model the economic behaviour of the fishermen in terms of the optimal quota size per vessel and optimal fleet size, a dual cost-function approach is an appropriate choice. This method is applied using a generalized Leontief cost function to model the behaviour of the Danish fleet of trawlers below 50 GRT, targeting species for human consumption solely. The estimated cost function is used to determine the optimal quotas yielding: (i) minimum average cost and (ii) maximum profit. The results of the estimations show that the optimal quotas per vessel should be increased by more than 2. 5 times and consequently that the fleet should be reduced by more than 60 %. As this has not been the case, a probable explanation is that non-transferable quotas leave the fishermen with the option of quitting the fishery only if a <b>decommissioning</b> <b>programme</b> is in place. There is no option to transfer the quota to another vessel.
