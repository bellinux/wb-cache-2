500|$|Having {{attracted}} the attention of scouts from several clubs whilst playing for local youth team Scole Lads, O'Keefe was invited to train with Norwich City's under-nine team. However, he later signed a youth deal with their East Anglian rivals Ipswich Town, joining the club at the age of nine, playing alongside Jordan Rhodes and Ed Upson in the academy during his time at the club. However, he failed to make an appearance for the first team and was released {{at the end of the}} 2006–07 season after Ipswich decided against offering him a scholarship, believing that he would be unable to compete physically at under-18 level. O'Keefe later commented on his release [...] "It was disappointing to be released by Ipswich, especially since <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> from such a young age, but I always kept believing in myself".|$|E
500|$|Pilou Asbæk, who {{was cast}} to play Euron Greyjoy, spoke in an {{interview}} about the filming of the Kingsmoot saying [...] "We spent two days on the Kingsmoot itself, and then two days on the montage. We shot it chronologically, which helped. The water was freezing cold. We shot the drowning many, many times. I remember looking down the shore, after <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> {{for five or six}} hours, and I saw two smiling faces, in the form of Gemma Whelan and Alfie Allen. They were just smiling their asses off, because they weren't cold! They just had to run to the boat." [...] In regards to stunts, Asbæk continued, [...] "I {{got a little bit of}} help, but not much. I think 95 percent of it was me. I like to do all of it when I can, because then I can feel it with the character." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some of the {{features}} in the early releases of the game were criticized by reviewers. GameSpys Mike Sharkey {{did not believe that}} the new content added was good, pointing out that the game provides very {{little in the way of}} new content; and that the Elo rating system seems ineffective, having many players of various skill levels all playing at once throughout the early days of release. Evan Lahti from PC Gamer noted that the majority of new official maps in Global Offensive were only for Arms Race or Demolition game modes; while Classic maps were only given [...] "smart adjustments" [...] to minor details. Pinsof thought that in its release state, it would not be the final version of the game to be released. Paul Goodman said that long-time fans of the series, Global Offensive will start to show the game's age, saying that he [...] "couldn't help but feel that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> and done that a dozen times before." ...|$|E

Lisa returns to care for Louise after she is seriously injured, arriving at the hospital in the closing moments of the episode. McFadden will also return to the serial in the episodes following Lisa's return and a show insider commented, [...] "When that hospital door starts to open, [...] be on tenterhooks to see who has rushed to help Louise.

I loved every minute of it." ...|$|E
