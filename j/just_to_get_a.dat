500|$|From {{the mid-1960s}} on, Waldron {{spent a lot}} of time in Europe: Paris, Rome, Bologna, and Cologne, before moving {{permanently}} to Munich in 1967. Waldron originally moved to France when film director Marcel Carné asked him if he wanted to compose the score for Three Rooms in Manhattan in New York or Paris; Waldron's 1958 experience touring Europe with Holiday made the decision an easy one. Waldron's stated reasons for settling in Europe were his disgust with the [...] "fierce, cutthroat competition, <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> job" [...] and the fact that black musicians were paid less than their white counterparts in the U.S. The 1965 score for Three Rooms in Manhattan was followed by one for the American film Sweet Love, Bitter in 1967.

500|$|By {{at least}} July 1999, Monolith {{has decided to}} {{introduce}} many major changes to the game; the main reason being that the gaming press unexpectedly started comparing the game to James Bond games, like GoldenEye 007 (1997). Hubbard mentioned that their intention was to [...] "make a 60s spy game", and that they [...] "didn't {{want to make a}} 'Bond' style game, so when people were obviously drawing that comparison, we decided to rework things a bit. We wanted {{to get away from the}} Bond comparisons that people were making, so we've changed the main character and the back-story a fair amount." [...] As a result, the player controls a female protagonist in the final game, Cate Archer, who works for an organization called UNITY. Changing the main character to a woman not only helped the separation of the game from the Bond franchise, but also allowed for [...] "more interesting dramatic possibilities", and the [...] "list of gadgets got a lot more visually interesting". As Hubbard said, before switching to a female protagonist, he had been [...] "struggling with trying to distinguish him from all the other male superspies from the era—extraordinarily handsome, intelligent, knowledgeable, resourceful, and so on. But a woman with those same characteristics immediately stood out because of the social climate of the time.
