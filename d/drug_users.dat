Polidore was bound and partially nude. Washington, a prostitute and possibly a <b>drug</b> <b>user,</b> may have been bound and wrapped up in bedding. Vitela, a <b>drug</b> <b>user</b> and prostitute, was nude and wrapped in bedding. This was also true of Jacox. Massey, possibly a <b>drug</b> <b>user</b> and prostitute, was bound, nude, and wrapped in bedding. These common factors were interpreted by police to mean they were dealing with only one killer.|$|R

5|$|AIDS {{was first}} {{clinically}} observed in 1981 in the United States. The initial cases were {{a cluster of}} injection <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> and gay men with no known cause of impaired immunity who showed symptoms of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), a rare opportunistic infection that was known to occur in people with very compromised immune systems. Soon thereafter, additional gay men developed a previously rare skin cancer called Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Many more cases of PCP and KS emerged, alerting U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a CDC task force was formed to monitor the outbreak. The earliest retrospectively described case of AIDS {{is believed to have}} been in Norway beginning in 1966.|$|E

5|$|Antiretroviral {{treatment}} {{among people}} with HIV whose CD4 count ≤ 550 cells/µL is a very effective way to prevent HIV infection of their partner (a strategy known as treatment as prevention, or TASP). TASP {{is associated with a}} 10 to 20 fold reduction in transmission risk. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with a daily dose of the medications tenofovir, with or without emtricitabine, is effective in a number of groups including {{men who have sex with}} men, couples where one is HIV positive, and young heterosexuals in Africa. It may also be effective in intravenous <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> with a study finding a decrease in risk of 0.7 to 0.4 per 100personyears.|$|E

5|$|Drug use and overdoses {{increased}} {{significantly in the}} 1800s due to the commercialization and availability of certain drugs. For example, while opium and coca had been used for centuries, their active ingredients, morphine and the cocaine alkaloid, were not isolated until 1803 and 1855 respectively. Cocaine and various opiates were subsequently mass-produced and sold openly and legally in the Western world, resulting in widespread misuse and addiction. Drug use and addiction also {{increased significantly}} following {{the invention of the}} hypodermic syringe in 1853, with overdose being a leading cause of death among intravenous <b>drug</b> <b>users.</b>|$|E
5|$|From the mid-20th century, {{the tunnel}} fell into disuse.

The Yugoslav Government's lack of transparency regarding the tunnel led to the rise of a number of urban legends, including the purported existence of walled-off corridors leading towards the Croatian Parliament palace on St. Mark's Square (in the centre of Gornji Grad), and towards Zagreb Observatory (the northernmost point of the neighbourhood) and on to Gupčeva Zvijezda.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{typically}} transmitted through unprotected sex or intravenous drug use, {{and is often}} associated with groups such as promiscuous gay men, illicit <b>drug</b> <b>users,</b> and sex workers. For these reasons, and also because of fears of contagion, people living with HIV are frequently subjected to stigma and discrimination. Publicity campaigns around the world have aimed to counter HIV-related prejudices and misconceptions and to replace them with an accurate understanding that helps to prevent new infections. These efforts have been aided by various celebrities – including American basketball star Magic Johnson and South African judge Edwin Cameron – who have publicly announced that they are HIV-positive.|$|E

5|$|House {{was created}} by David Shore, who {{got the idea for}} the misanthropic title {{character}} from a doctor's visit. Initially, producer Bryan Singer wanted an American to play House, but British actor Hugh Laurie's audition convinced him that a foreign actor could play the role. Shore wrote House as a character with parallels to Sherlock Holmes—both are <b>drug</b> <b>users,</b> blunt, and close to being friendless. The show's producers wanted House handicapped in some way and gave the character a damaged leg arising from an improper diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Meth {{mouth is}} very {{difficult}} to treat unless the patient stops using methamphetamine; persistent drug use makes changes in hygiene or nutrition practices unlikely. Many <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> lack access to dental treatment, and few are willing to participate in such a course of action, often because of poverty. Those who are willing to seek dental treatment often resist discussing their drug use. Providing dental treatment to individuals who use methamphetamine can also be dangerous, because the potential combination of local anesthetic and methamphetamine can cause serious heart problems. There is also an increased risk of serious side effects if opioid medications are used in the patient's treatment.|$|E

In early life she had been a chain smoker, giving up the addiction cold turkey in the mid-1960s. In 1976 and 1987 she had cosmetic surgery on her neck to prevent it from broadening with age, but has stated that she has not had surgery to make her face look younger. During the 1990s, she began to suffer from arthritis, in May 1994 had hip replacement surgery, and in 2005 had knee replacement surgery.|$|E

5|$|The {{second most}} {{frequent}} mode of HIV transmission is via blood and blood products. Blood-borne transmission can be through needle-sharing during intravenous drug use, needle stick injury, transfusion of contaminated blood or blood product, or medical injections with unsterilized equipment. The risk from sharing a needle during drug injection is between 0.63 and 2.4% per act, {{with an average}} of 0.8%. The risk of acquiring HIV from a needle stick from an HIV-infected person is estimated as 0.3% (about 1 in 333) per act and the risk following mucous membrane exposure to infected blood as 0.09% (about 1 in 1000) per act. In the United States intravenous <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> made up 12% of all new cases of HIV in 2009, and in some areas more than 80% of people who inject drugs are HIV positive.|$|E
5|$|Methamphetamine (meth), {{a highly}} {{addictive}} drug {{that produces a}} dramatic increase in energy and euphoria, can have negative health effects that include serious dental problems. , it is the most discussed illegal drug in dental literature. The most notable effect of long-term use of methamphetamine on dental health is the development of caries (tooth decay); the teeth of some <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> appear to be dark and in the process of disintegrating. Caries often occur in the cervical regions of teeth, where the tooth surface narrows at the junction of the crown and the root. It is usually found on the buccal (cheek) side of the teeth and on tooth surfaces that are adjacent to incisors and canines; eventually, the coronal tooth area, near the crown, can be affected by the decay and erosion. The dental caries of meth mouth often progress slowly, perhaps because their advancement is hindered by intermittent hygienic practices. The decay can lead to tooth fractures and severe pain. In some cases, teeth are permanently damaged and must be removed. Along with malnutrition and weight loss, the dental effects of methamphetamine use contribute to the appearance of premature aging seen in some users. The effects of meth mouth {{are similar to those of}} Sjögren's syndrome, an autoimmune disease that causes a lack of saliva, which results in tooth decay.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the toxic effects information came from a study conducted between 1 April 2005 to 1 September 2005. The study recorded all presentations associated with party pill use at the Emergency Department of Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand by recording them on a prospective data collection form. The aim was to study the patterns of human toxicity related {{to the use of}} benzylpiperazine-based 'party pills'. 61 patients presented on 80 occasions. Patients with mild to moderate toxicity experienced symptoms such as insomnia, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, dystonia and urinary retention. Significantly, fourteen toxic seizures were recorded with two patients suffering life-threatening toxicity with status epilepticus and severe respiratory and metabolic acidosis. It was concluded that BZP appears to induce toxic seizures in neurologically normal subjects. The results of this study and others like it showed that BZP can cause unpredictable and serious toxicity in some individuals, but the data and dosage collection were reliant on self reporting by <b>drug</b> <b>users,</b> which may result in under-reporting (or over-reporting), and there were complicating factors like the frequent presence of alcohol and other drugs.|$|E
