5000|$|The Brundall {{shipyard}} had two partners, John Eastwood and John Elliot. Eastwood {{acted as}} the main boatbuilder and engineer. According to Eastwood, the Electron’s modifications were made {{in order to accommodate}} numerous technological and electronic inventions meant primarily for preventing the ship from capsizing in large seas. Because of its multi-hulled design, the trimaran is fast and fairly stable due to it’s weight dispersal over a large surface area. However, it cannot right itself if capsized like a mono-hulled ship would be able to. Crowhurst, anxious about the rough waters of the Roaring Forties and Cape Horn, attached a buoyancy bag to the mainmast, that would inflate when a main computer sensed the boat was falling and keep the boat at a rightable 90 degree angle. However, due to severe time and capital constraints, and a potential lack in technical ability, the main computer was never installed in the ship—even though the <b>electronic</b> <b>wiring</b> that ran underneath the decking and along the roof of the cabin was in place, they terminated in a tangle of unconnected wires.|$|E

Despite their widely varying backgrounds, these students thrived in spite of being away from home {{in an environment that}} was conducive to discussion, debate and friendship helping each other with their problems and frustrations associated with all their disabilities. Throughout the 1950s the college went from strength to strength. It had a close working relationship with the National Coal Board with efforts particular aimed at the mining communities. The college also became a vital link for disabled and handicapped school leavers supplying further education and the college commitments were extended to provide this along with vocational training. 1961 saw the first female students enrolled at the college. At this time new courses were introduced and these included shorthand and typing followed by course in <b>electronic</b> <b>wiring</b> and assembly, and industrial electronics.

40|$|International audienceSmall-amplitude oscillatory {{rheology}} is used {{to probe}} the microstructure present in aqueous composite electrode slurries for lithium batteries. The materials prepared with carboxymethyl cellulose as the thickener displays a solidlike behavior due to the buildup of a three-dimensional network of colloidal carbon black (CB) particles bridged by the polymeric chains. This network is able to support and inhibit the settling of the larger LiFePO 4 particles. Thus a homogeneous morphology is achieved in the dried composite electrode and good electrochemical performance is displayed both at low and high rates. Contrarily, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose is observed to create weaker bonds between the CB particles and the materials prepared with this thickener display a liquidlike behavior.

40|$|International {{audience}} Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning {{electron microscopy}}, and high-resolution {{transmission electron microscopy}} experiments indicate that molecular junctions can be achieved between non-carbon-coated LiFePO 4 (LFP) and multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) using a thiophene-based conjugated system {{which was designed to}} selectively functionalize these two different types of surfaces. The strategy enables the architecturing of the cathode electrode of lithium batteries, leading to a vast improvement in the component intermixing, which results in the individual MWCNT being nanocontacted at the surface of LFP grains. This advancement leads to much higher specific capacity, especially at high charge/discharge rates, for undensified electrodes of 2 mA h cm– 2, for which the <b>electronic</b> <b>wiring</b> of the electroactive material is a critical issue. Furthermore, thanks to molecular junctions, better capacity retention comparable to that of carbon-coated LiFePO 4 electrodes could be achieved.
