5|$|The SS90 was {{an early}} {{prototype}} round used only in the earliest examples of the P90. It used a lightweight 1.5-g (23grain) <b>full</b> <b>metal</b> <b>jacket</b> bullet with a polymer core, which it propelled at a muzzle velocity of roughly 850m/s (2,800ft/s).

5|$|Co-writer Theroux {{revealed}} that the initial script concept was to have actors go to a mock boot camp and return with posttraumatic stress disorder. The final script was developed to satirize Vietnam War films such as Apocalypse Now, Rambo, Missing in Action, Platoon, <b>Full</b> <b>Metal</b> <b>Jacket,</b> Hamburger Hill, and The Deer Hunter. Theroux pointed out that since viewers had an increased awareness of {{the inner workings of}} Hollywood due to celebrity websites and Hollywood news sources, the script was easier to write. Dialogue for unscripted portions of the storyboard was developed on set by the actors or was improvised.|$|E

After Chris is {{accepted}} to Morningwood Academy, he is asleep in his bed for the night, and is suddenly attacked by a group of classmates, who stuff wads of dollar bills into their socks, and quickly begin beating him with the weapons. This scene is a parody of that of the infamous sequence shown in director Stanley Kubrick's 1987 war film <b>Full</b> <b>Metal</b> <b>Jacket,</b> in which the Marine recruits take turns striking Private Pyle with bars of soap wrapped in towels as punishment for frequently getting them in trouble.|$|E
5|$|On December 18, 2006, a video {{which showed}} BackupHDDVD {{being used to}} decrypt and copy the film <b>Full</b> <b>Metal</b> <b>Jacket</b> to a hard drive was {{uploaded}} to YouTube.

5|$|The pre-credits {{sequence}} used {{a church}} in Stoke Poges as a cemetery, while the helicopter scenes were filmed at the abandoned Beckton Gas Works in London. The gas works were also the location for some of Stanley Kubrick's 1987 film, <b>Full</b> <b>Metal</b> <b>Jacket.</b> Director John Glen {{got the idea for}} the remote-controlled helicopter after seeing a child playing with an RC car. Since flying a helicopter through a warehouse was thought to be too dangerous, the scene was shot using forced perspective. A smaller mock-up was built by Derek Meddings' team closer to the camera that the stunt pilot Marc Wolff flew behind and this made it seem as if the helicopter was entering the warehouse. The footage inside the building was shot on location, though with a life-sized helicopter model which stood over a rail. Stuntman Martin Grace stood as Bond when the agent is dangling outside the flying helicopter, while Roger Moore himself was used in the scenes inside the model.|$|E

50|$|The use of <b>full</b> <b>metal</b> <b>jacketing</b> in {{military}} ammunition {{came about because}} of the need for improved feeding characteristics in small arms using internal mechanical manipulation of the cartridge to chamber rounds as opposed to externally hand-reloading single-shot firearms. The harder gilding was less prone to deformation than softer exposed lead, which improved feeding. It is often thought that military use of FMJ ammunition was the result of The Hague Convention of 1899, Declaration III, prohibiting the use in international warfare of bullets that easily expand or flatten in the body, but this only addresses that projectiles must not be designed to flatten or expand, not that they be jacketed. Jacketed bullets had been in use since at least 1882.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} application of natural rubber (NR) latex as a thin coating matrix on unidirectional (UD) fabrics for ballistic impact applications. Pre-vulcanised NR lattices were used to coat ballistic fabrics mainly by the single dip method and half dip method. It was found that NR latex changes the frictional aspects among the fibers attached with thin polyethylene film in the coated fabrics. The NR latex film was able to bind the polyethylene film, restrict mobility and share in resisting load applied to the fabric. In particular, an increase in friction was evident from the higher tensile, tearing and puncture resistance of the NR latex coated fabrics in comparison with neat fabrics. In the ballistic impact tests, utilizing several NR latex-coated fabrics in a fabric system increases the ballistic limit as high as 65 % in comparisons with all-neat fabric system. The single dip coating technique gave higher ballistic limit value than the all-neat {{and other types of}} coating technique which was fired by <b>Full</b> <b>Metal</b> <b>Jacketed</b> Round Nose bullet. Somehow, the half dip coating method has the potential for ballistic applications because of the slight increase in the ballistic limit of a 12 -layer fabric system. In subsequent tests, as high 23 % in blunt trauma reduction was achieved using 4 NR latexcoated layers in the fabric system. The main deformation modes were small deflection or ballistic punch and peeling off of the NR latex film at the impact point. Neat fabrics failed mainly through broken fibers, fiber delamination, fiber pull out and fiber stretching. Calcium carbonate dispersion as a filler in the NR latex compounding also contributed in increasing the ballistic limit of the fabric systems. However, when compared with the unfilled NR latex-coated fabrics, the filler did not show to give any significant differences. As a conclusion, {{it can be said that}} the NR latex-coated fabrics were effective in absorbing the impact energy and reducing blunt trauma and has the potential to be used as blunt trauma panel and positioned at the rear of a body armour fabric system...|$|R

At one point the soldiers enter a building to flush out a sniper. This building {{was one of several}} located between the central buildings of the old gasworks and about 200 yards from the river Thames. The final scene sees the soldiers marching off into the (London) sunset against the silhouettes of the burning gasworks' chimneys and buildings, singing the Mickey Mouse March from the US children's TV show. In the film a period of several days takes place in the protagonist's lives as they travel through the industrial quarters of Huế city; in reality the action took place within just one square mile.
