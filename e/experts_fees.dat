Murphy, 548 U.S. 291 (2006), was a United States Supreme Court {{case about}} <b>experts</b> <b>fees</b> in cases {{commenced}} under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Justice Samuel Alito, {{writing for the}} majority, ruled that IDEA does not authorize the payment of the <b>experts</b> <b>fees</b> of the prevailing parents.

5000|$|In 2006, {{however, the}} Supreme Court decided {{the case of}} Arlington Central School Dist. Bd. of Ed. v. Murphy. The Court ruled that because the {{statutory}} text of the IDEA did not explicitly state that <b>expert</b> witness <b>fees</b> were covered, parents could not recover them. The Court reasoned that because the IDEA was enacted under the Spending Clause of the Constitution, Article I, Section 8, the law must “unambiguously” give notice in its statutory text that parents could recover fees. This meant Congress had to declare {{in the body of}} the statute that parents could recover <b>expert</b> witness <b>fees.</b> [...] The IDEA Fairness Restoration Act will amend the statutory text of the IDEA to permit recovery of <b>expert</b> witness <b>fees.</b> Until Congress does, parents must pay their own <b>expert</b> witness <b>fee</b> expenses, even when they prevail.|$|R

Two different scenarios are distinguished. In the cure scenario, the client is uncertain whether he can be cured. A contingent fee now solves both incentive problems. In the prevention scenario, the client is uncertain whether he faces a future loss that needs prevention. If the client can commit himself to not renegotiating after the expert’s prescription, it is optimal to induce a lower effort than in the first-best effort, and to make the <b>expert’s</b> <b>fee</b> less contingent. However, this contract is not renegotiation proof. Legal restrictions on contingent fees may then serve as a device by which the client can commit himself to not renegotiating.

50|$|Held: <b>Expert</b> witness {{attendance}} <b>fees</b> {{that are}} available in cases brought under this Court’s original jurisdiction shall {{be the same as}} the <b>expert</b> witness attendance <b>fees</b> that would be available in a district court under §1821(b). Kansas contends that Congress has never attempted to regulate a prevailing party’s recovery of <b>expert</b> witness <b>fees</b> in a case brought under this Court’s original jurisdiction, that Article III of the Constitution would not permit Congress to impose such a restriction, and thus, that the holding in Crawford Fitting Co. v. J. T. Gibbons, Inc., 482 U. S. 437 - that district courts must adhere to §1821(b)’s witness attendance fee limitations—is not relevant here. Assuming that Kansas’ interpretation is correct and that this Court has discretion to determine the fees that are recoverable in original actions, it is nevertheless appropriate to follow §1821(b). Congress’ decision not to permit a prevailing party in the lower courts to recover its actual witness fee expenses departs only slightly from the “American Rule,” under which parties generally bear their own expenses. There is no good reason why the rule for recovering <b>expert</b> witness <b>fees</b> should differ markedly depending on whether a case is originally brought in district court or this Court. District-court cases may be no less complex than those brought originally in this Court. And while the parties in original cases may incur substantial expert costs, as happened here, the same is frequently true in lower court litigation. Thus, assuming that the matter is left entirely to this Court’s discretion, the best approach is to have a uniform rule that applies in all federal cases. Pp. 3-5.|$|R
