5|$|Like other abelisaurs where {{material}} from the forelimbs is available, the arms and hands of Limusaurus were considerably reduced, {{even more so than}} that of Ceratosaurus. The first <b>finger</b> was smaller than the other fingers and lacked digits entirely. As for the other fingers, the second <b>finger</b> was very robust and had three digits, the third <b>finger</b> only had three digits as opposed to four in other early theropods, and the preserved portions of the fourth <b>finger</b> indicate that it was comparatively long and slender, terminating in a single digit. The claws were short, stout, and expanded at their base.|$|E

40|$|Viscous <b>fingers</b> {{have been}} {{produced}} in the lifting Hele-Shaw cell (LHSC), with concentric circular grooves etched onto the lower plate. The invading fluid (air) enters the defending newtonian fluid-olive oil, as <b>fingers</b> proceeding radially inwards towards the centre. The <b>fingers</b> are interrupted at the circular groove, and reform as secondary <b>fingers.</b> The effect of the grooves is {{to speed up the}} <b>fingering</b> process considerably and the <b>fingers</b> now reach the centre much faster. We explain this by comparing the variation with time, in velocity of the <b>fingers</b> in the normal LHSC and the grooved cells. In the normal lifting HS cell the <b>fingers</b> move fastest on initial formation and slow down later. Since in case of the grooved plate, the <b>fingers</b> reform and receive a boost in their speed each time they encounter a groove, the <b>fingers</b> proceed to the centre faster.

5|$|The forelimbs were robustly {{built and}} {{proportionally}} long, measuring 70% {{of the length}} of the hind limbs. The radius of the forearm measured 70% {{of the length of}} the humerus (forearm bone). The hand was large, approaching the humerus in length, and possessed five fingers equipped for grasping. The second <b>finger</b> was the longest, followed by the third and the first <b>finger</b> (the thumb). The first three fingers ended in large and strong claws. The fourth and fifth fingers were strongly reduced, and possibly vestigial. The phalangeal formula, which states the number of <b>finger</b> bones in each <b>finger</b> starting from the first, was 2-3-4-3-2.|$|E
5|$|The gesture {{dates back}} to Ancient Greece {{and it was also}} used in Ancient Rome. Historically, it {{represented}} the phallus. In some modern cultures, it has gained increasing recognition as a sign of disrespect, and has been used by music artists (notably more common among hardcore punk bands and rappers), actors, celebrities, athletes, and politicians. Most still view the gesture as obscene. The index <b>finger</b> and ring <b>finger</b> besides the middle <b>finger</b> in more contemporary periods has been likened to represent the testicles.|$|E
5|$|The middle <b>finger</b> gesture {{was used}} in Ancient times {{as a symbol of}} sexual intercourse, in a manner meant to degrade, intimidate and {{threaten}} the individual receiving the gesture. It also represented the phallus, with the fingers next to the middle <b>finger</b> representing testicles; from its close association, the gesture may have assumed apotropaic potency. In the 1st-century Mediterranean world, extending the <b>finger</b> was one of many methods used to divert the ever-present threat of the evil eye.|$|E

An appellate court in Hartford, Connecticut ruled in 1976 that gesturing with the middle <b>finger</b> was offensive, but not obscene, after a police officer charged a 16-year-old with making an obscene gesture when the student gave the officer the middle <b>finger.</b> The case was appealed to the Connecticut Supreme Court, which upheld the decision. In March 2006, a federal lawsuit was filed regarding the free speech issue.|$|E
5|$|The nesting {{specimen}} {{was found}} in a stratigraphic area indicating that oviraptorids preferred nesting near streams that provided soft, sandy substrate and food in environments that were otherwise xeric (receiving a small amount of moisture). Many oviraptorids have been found in brooding positions, indicating they may have brooded for relatively long periods, similar to modern birds such as the ostrich, emu, and black-breasted buzzard, which brood for more than 40 days with a limited supply of sustenance. Nesting in desert environments can be harmful to adults that stay in the nest for large parts of the day, and for eggs and nestlings, due to heat stress. The choice of nesting area may therefore have been a mechanism for successful incubation in extreme heat. It has also been suggested that the evolution of tail-feathers in oviraptorosaurs was an adaptation for shading and protecting eggs in their nests. That the second <b>finger</b> of ingeniine oviraptorids was reduced in size compared to the robust first <b>finger</b> may be explained by a change in function; it {{may be related to the}} presence of long wing feathers that were attached to the second <b>finger.</b> These wing feathers were probably used to protect the eggs during nesting. When the second <b>finger</b> began functioning as a feather support, its ability to grasp was reduced, and this function was taken over by the first <b>finger,</b> which therefore became more robust. The third <b>finger</b> was reduced in size, too, probably because it was positioned behind the wing feathers in a way where it would not be effective for grasping.|$|E

5|$|Bowling {{for long}} periods caused McCool to {{continually}} tear a callus on his third <b>finger,</b> which he used to impart spin on the ball. As a result, Bradman felt compelled to leave {{him out of the}} Test matches, feeling that his <b>finger</b> {{would not be able to}} handle the necessarily long bowling spells. This decision was aided by England and Australia’s agreement to allow a new ball to be used every 55 overs, instead of the incumbent regulation of permitting a new ball for every 200 runs scored, which usually took longer than 55 overs. This meant the ball was in a shiny state more often, and therefore more conducive to fast and swing bowling, so Bradman relied heavily on his pacemen. For the rest of his career, McCool was troubled by the skin rubbing off his spinning <b>finger.</b>|$|E

40|$|Music <b>fingering</b> is a {{cognitive}} process whose {{goal is to}} map each note of a music score to a <b>fingering</b> on some instrument. A <b>fingering</b> specifies the <b>fingers</b> of the hands that the player should use to play the notes. This problem arises for many instruments {{and it can be}} quite different from instrument to instrument; guitar <b>fingering,</b> for example, is different from piano <b>fingering.</b> Previous work focuses on specific instruments, in particular the guitar, and evolutionary algorithms have been used. In this paper, we propose a differential evolution (DE) algorithm designed for general music <b>fingering</b> (any kind of music instruments). The algorithm uses an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) engine that learns the <b>fingering</b> from music already <b>fingered.</b> The algorithm follows the basic DE strategy but exploits also some customizations specific to the <b>fingering</b> problem. We have implemented the DE algorithm in Java and we have used the ANFIS network in Matlab. The two systems communicate by using the MatlabControl library. Several tests have been performed to evaluate its efficacy...|$|R
