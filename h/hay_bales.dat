Outside, Payne starts singing the opening lines, as others are seen playing guitars sitting on <b>hay</b> <b>bales</b> in a camp setting. Subsequent scenes inter cut {{featuring}} One Direction performing the song at the camp setting in a circle, on an open field, driving a car, and at a lake where {{members of the group}} play in plastic bubbles and boats. As it turns to nighttime, the camp is the main setting; they conduct a football match and afterwards a pool party. The video ends with One Direction looking at the camera, with Malik singing the last line. Throughout the video, teenage boys and girls are showing with the band.|$|E
5|$|Females {{are ready}} to breed at ten to eleven months of age {{although}} males sometimes wait till the following year. Barn owls are usually monogamous, sticking to one partner for life unless one of the pair dies. During the non-breeding season they may roost separately, but as the breeding season approaches they return to their established nesting site, showing considerable site fidelity. In colder climates, in harsh weather and where winter food supplies may be scarce, they may roost in farm buildings and in barns between <b>hay</b> <b>bales,</b> but they then run the risk that their selected nesting hole may {{be taken over by}} some other, earlier-nesting species. Single males may establish feeding territories, patrolling the hunting areas, occasionally stopping to hover, and perching on lofty eminences where they screech to attract a mate. Where a female has lost her mate but maintained her breeding site, she usually seems to manage to attract a new spouse.|$|E
5|$|In December 1979, Roberts {{made good}} on his threats when he, {{along with the other}} top world {{championship}} riders, released a letter to the press announcing their intention to break away from the FIM and create a rival race series called the World Series. When Roberts first arrived on the Grand Prix scene, motorcycle racers were competing for as little prize money as $200, at venues such as Imatra in Finland that featured railroad crossings and <b>hay</b> <b>bales</b> wrapped around telephone poles. In 1956, the reigning 500cc world champion, Geoff Duke and thirteen other riders were given six-month suspensions for merely threatening to strike. Roberts adopted a confrontational, sometimes belligerent stance with race promoters, challenging the previously accepted poor treatment that motorcycle racers of the day were accustomed to receiving. Although the competing series failed to take off due to difficulties in securing enough venues, it forced the FIM to take the riders' demands seriously and make changes regarding their safety. During the 1979 FIM Congress, new rules were passed increasing prize money substantially and in subsequent years, stricter safety regulations were imposed on race organizers.|$|E
50|$|Athletes {{ran around}} a 450-meter path {{outside of the}} stadium. In the stadium, there were five rows of <b>hay</b> <b>bale</b> walls. The athletes would enter the stadium and clean a sandbag up and toss it over the <b>hay</b> <b>bale</b> wall. They would then perform a burpee and then jump over the wall. The <b>hay</b> <b>bale</b> clean burpee would be {{performed}} seven times at the same <b>hay</b> <b>bale</b> wall before moving the sandbag to the next wall. After the sandbag is moved, the athletes {{ran back to the}} path to make another lap. The sandbags were 100 pounds for the men and 70 pounds for the women. The event was won by Ricky Garard for the men and Samantha Briggs for the women.|$|R

25|$|This slide led to {{the first}} {{fatality}} at the park, a head injury suffered in 1980 by an employee whose sled ran off the track; he then fell down a large embankment and hit his head on a rock, which killed him. <b>Hay</b> <b>bales</b> at the curves were meant to cushion the impact of those whose sleds jumped the track (a frequent occurrence), but did not always do so effectively. According to state records, in 1984 and 1985 the alpine slide produced 14 fractures and 26 head injuries. While park officials regularly asserted its safety, saying that 90-year-old grandmothers could and did ride it, {{in the early years}} of the park the slide was responsible for the bulk of the accidents, injuries, lawsuits, and state citations for safety violations.|$|E
25|$|The {{next year}} the Royal Automobile Club took a lease on the {{airfield}} and set out a more formal racing circuit. Their first two races were held on the runways themselves, with long straights separated by tight hairpin corners, the track demarcated by <b>hay</b> <b>bales.</b> However, for the 1949 International Trophy meeting, {{it was decided to}} switch to the perimeter track. This arrangement was used for the 1950 and 1951 Grands Prix. In 1952 the start line was moved from the Farm Straight to the straight linking Woodcote and Copse corners, and this layout remained largely unaltered for the following 38 years. For the 1975 meeting a chicane was introduced to try to tame speeds through the mighty Woodcote Corner (although MotoGP would still use the circuit without the chicane up until 1986), and Bridge Corner was subtly rerouted in 1987.|$|E

40|$|Hay {{that has}} been baled with {{incorrect}} moisture content or {{that has been}} {{under the influence of}} moisture has potential to generate heat and create a fire hazard.

Tests were conducted to determine the maximum amount of hay through which a 2. 4 GHz ZigBee module could transmit data and the resulting signal strength (RSSI).
