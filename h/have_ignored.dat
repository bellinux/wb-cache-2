5|$|This Joker's Card is a {{representation}} of the ghettos and the violence that occurs within them. It {{takes the form of a}} traveling carnival which releases the same brutality on those who <b>have</b> <b>ignored</b> the inner cities' cries for help. The Card issues a warning against the upper-class and government's negligence toward the lower classes. The cover of Carnival of Carnage was drawn by Joseph Utsler, who would later create artwork for the rest of the albums in the Joker's Cards series.|$|E
5|$|A superstition that is {{prevalent}} among many of today's NHL players {{is that no}} player should either touch or hoist the Wales (Eastern Conference champion) or Clarence S. Campbell (Western Conference champion) Trophies after they have won the conference playoffs; these players feel that the Stanley Cup is the true championship trophy and thus {{it should be the}} only trophy that they should be hoisting. Instead of touching the conference trophy, the captain of the winning team merely poses (usually looking solemn) with the trophy, and sometimes, the entire team poses as well. However, there have been other teams who <b>have</b> <b>ignored</b> the superstition and hoisted the conference trophies, sometimes going on to win the Cup anyway.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, maroons came to live in the Great Dismal Swamp. Most settled on mesic islands, the high and dry parts of the swamp. Inhabitants included slaves who had purchased their freedom as well as escaped slaves. Other escaped slaves used the swamp as a route on the Underground Railroad {{as they made their way}} further north. Some slaves lived there in semi-free conditions, but how much independence slaves actually enjoyed there has been a topic of much debate. Nearby whites often left enslaved maroons alone so long as they paid a quota in logs or shingles, and businesses may <b>have</b> <b>ignored</b> the fugitive nature of escaped slaves who provided work in exchange for trade goods.|$|E

5|$|John {{rebuilt the}} monastic church at Bath, {{which had been}} damaged during one of Robert de Mowbray's rebellions. As rebuilt, it was only surpassed in size by the cathedrals at Ely, Norwich and Winchester. The present Bath Cathedral is not the {{building}} that John built, and occupies {{only a fraction of}} the space that John's building encompassed. He also reformed the administration of his diocese, setting up archdeacons and organising a court for hearing ecclesiastical cases. His efforts to reform his diocese led to his cathedral chapter's complaining of their treatment, which John seems to <b>have</b> <b>ignored.</b> At Wells, he was accused of destroying the community of canons there, which had been created by his predecessor.|$|E
5|$|Osorkon IV is attested by Assyrian {{documents}} (as Shilkanni {{and other}} epithets) and probably {{also by the}} Books of Kings (as King So), while Manetho's epitomes seem to <b>have</b> <b>ignored</b> him. He is undoubtedly attested by the well-known Victory Stela of Piye on which he is depicted while prostrating {{in front of the}} owner of the stela along with other submitted rulers. Another finding almost certainly referring to him is the aforementioned aegis of Sekhmet, found at Bubastis and mentioning a King Osorkon son of queen Tadibast whoas the name does not coincide with those of any of the other Osorkon kings' motherscan only be Osorkon IV's mother.|$|E
5|$|As a term, neo {{soul was}} coined by Kedar Massenburg of Motown Records {{in the late}} 1990s as a {{marketing}} category following the commercial breakthroughs of artists such as D'Angelo, Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill, and Maxwell. The success of D'Angelo's 1995 debut album Brown Sugar has been regarded by several writers and music critics as inspiration behind the term's origin. While some artists <b>have</b> <b>ignored</b> the label, others have received the designation with controversy because it may seem contrived to music audiences and imply that soul music had ended {{at some point in}} time. In a 2002 interview for Billboard, Massenburg said that genre classifications are often unpopular because they may be suggestive of a short-lived trend. However, although he said neo soul is still essentially soul music, Massenburg felt there was a need to market artists of the genre for listeners to have an understanding of what they were buying.|$|E

They <b>had</b> <b>ignored</b> me, going into realms of muslin, {{questions}} of maid- servants, female rights, and cheap under-clothing; and I therefore <b>had</b> <b>ignored</b> them. My mind had gone back to Mr. Horne and his garments. While they spoke of their rights, I was thinking of his wrongs; when they mentioned the price of flannel, I thought of that of broadcloth.|$|R

25|$|Pseudoarchaeology is an {{umbrella}} term for all activities that falsely {{claim to be}} archaeological but in fact violate commonly accepted and scientific archaeological practices.

25|$|The first Joker's Card, Carnival of Carnage (1992), is a {{representation}} of the ghetto and the violence that occurs within.

The Card issues a warning against the upper-class and government's negligence toward the lower classes.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, former Azerbaijani {{football}} star Gurban Gurbanov was appointed {{as head coach}} after the unexpected departure of Rasim Kara to Khazar Lankaran one week {{before the start of}} the 2008–09 season. Led by Gurban Gurbanov, Qarabağ <b>have</b> <b>ignored</b> a common strategy in Azerbaijani football: eschewing foreign signings in favour of nurturing local talent. Gurbanov brought with him a tiki-taka style of play, characterised by short passes, long periods of build-up and players interchanging positions.|$|E

25|$|The {{conversation}} surrounding The Count propelled VIDA forward, and {{it continues}} to grow in membership and notoriety. Since 2010, VIDA has published a yearly version of The Count. The reactions of the magazines included in The Count are as varied as the comments section below The Count on VIDA's website. Some magazines <b>have</b> <b>ignored</b> the numbers, others have challenged the validity of the numbers, and some have actively tried to address the issue and change it.|$|E
25|$|The recommendation, which Transit could <b>have</b> <b>ignored</b> only at {{the risk}} of {{drawn-out}} legal fights at the Environment Court level (which would probably have delayed the project until after the 2011 Rugby World Cup), was based on the concerns of residents, who feared that the new interchange would increase and cement separation of their suburb from the Manukau Harbour. Partly due to this, Transit New Zealand decided in August 2007 to continue with building the new bridge without including a new interchange for the time being.|$|E
25|$|Having seen Schiller's play in Milan in an Italian translation, Donizetti {{approached}} the famed librettist Felice Romani, {{who had written}} a successful libretto in 1830 for Anna Bolena, the opera which secured the composer's place {{as one of the}} leaders of his day. Wanting a strong and powerful subject for his new work, the composer's idea was to have Romani prepare a libretto about Mary Stuart, but the librettist appears to <b>have</b> <b>ignored</b> him, perhaps because of his desire to get away from writing for the theatre, which he increasingly found to be distasteful.|$|E

25|$|The {{congress}} also criticized {{the armed forces}} for failing to conduct adequate antireligious education among its soldiers. The organization had set up cells {{in the armed forces}} in each unit beginning in 1927. In a study done on a unit in 1925, it was found that 60% of recruits were religious believers at the time of recruitment, while only 28% remained believers {{at the end of their}} service. This data may <b>have</b> <b>ignored</b> the phenomena of soldiers who hid their religious convictions during their service and thus have some inaccuracy. These experiences nevertheless played a role in the LMG's approach to combatting religion in the military in the following decade.|$|E
25|$|Brunelleschi's {{first major}} {{architectural}} commission {{was for the}} enormous brick dome which covers the central space of Florence's cathedral, designed by Arnolfo di Cambio in the 14th century but left unroofed. While often described as the first building of the Renaissance, Brunelleschi's daring design utilizes the pointed Gothic arch and Gothic ribs that were apparently planned by Arnolfio. It seems certain, however, that while stylistically Gothic, {{in keeping with the}} building it surmounts, the dome is in fact structurally influenced by the great dome of Ancient Rome, which Brunelleschi could hardly <b>have</b> <b>ignored</b> in seeking a solution. This is the dome of the Pantheon, a circular temple, now a church.|$|E
25|$|An early {{survey of}} Galveston Island, {{performed}} late Saturday, September13 and Sunday, September14, 2008, {{indicated that the}} entirety of the Island west of 11 Mile Road was entirely devastated, and that few structures on Galveston's western one-third had survived. This area of near-total destruction includes the communities of Bayou Vista and Jamaica Beach, as well as the Galveston Country Club and the Galveston Island State Park. The affected area previously included some 1,000 structures, including single-family dwellings, commercial enterprises, and hotels and resorts. It is unknown how many residents may <b>have</b> <b>ignored</b> repeated calls to evacuate, or what became of those who decided to remain in Galveston's vulnerable West End.|$|E
50|$|McDougall {{produced}} another work attacking materialism titled Materialism and Emergent Evolution (1929). In {{the book}} he had also criticised the theory of emergent evolution as he claimed it <b>had</b> <b>ignored</b> the evidence of Lamarckism and <b>had</b> <b>ignored</b> the evidence of mind guiding evolution. McDougall's last work on the subject titled The Riddle of Life (1938) criticised organicism as according to McDougall even though the theory of organicism had rejected materialism it had not gone far enough in advocating an active role for a nonphysical principle.|$|R
