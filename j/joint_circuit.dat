5000|$|Many of the {{earliest}} white rock and roll hits were covers or partial re-writes of earlier black rhythm and blues or blues songs. Through the late 1940s and early 1950s, R&B music had been gaining a stronger beat and a wilder style, with artists such as Fats Domino and Johnny Otis speeding up the tempos and increasing the backbeat to great popularity on the juke <b>joint</b> <b>circuit.</b> Before the efforts of Freed and others, black music was taboo on many white-owned radio outlets, but artists and producers quickly recognized the potential of rock and roll. Most of Presley's early hits were covers of black rhythm and blues or blues songs, like [...] "That's All Right" [...] (a countrified arrangement of a blues number), [...] "Baby Let's Play House", [...] "Lawdy Miss Clawdy" [...] and [...] "Hound Dog". The racial lines however are rather more clouded {{by the fact that}} some of these R&B songs originally recorded by black artists had been written by white songwriters, such as the team of Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. Songwriting credits were often unreliable; many publishers, record executives, and even managers (both white and black) would insert their name as composer in order to collect royalty checks.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The radar {{ambiguity}} function, {{described as}} an autocorrelation of shifts in time and frequency, is useful for determining a waveform’s accuracy at detecting targets in certain range-Doppler combinations. An algorithm is proposed which uses a generalized method of alternating projections to synthe-size waveforms with desired ambiguity function properties. In practice, it is often desirable to minimize {{the magnitude of the}} ambiguity function at range-Doppler combinations where targets other than the detection are likely to cause interference. The algorithm alternates between projections in the time, frequency, and range-Doppler domains until an optimal solution which fits desired ambiguity function properties is found.

40|$|Purpose: Computer {{vision has}} been widely used in the {{inspection}} of electronic components. This paper proposes a computer vision system for the automatic detection, localisation, and segmentation of solder <b>joints</b> on Printed <b>Circuit</b> Boards (PCBs) under different illumination conditions. Design/methodology/approach: An illumination normalization approach is applied to an image, which can effectively and efficiently eliminate the effect of uneven illumination while keeping {{the properties of the}} processed image the same as in the corresponding image under normal lighting conditions. Consequently special lighting and instrumental setup can be reduced in order to detect solder joints. These normalised images are insensitive to illumination variations and are used for the subsequent solder joint detection stages. In the segmentation approach, the PCB image is transformed from an RGB color space to a YIQ color space for the effective detection of solder joints from the background. Findings: The segmentation results show that the proposed approach improves the performance significantly for images under varying illumination conditions. Research limitations/implications: This paper proposes a front-end system for the automatic detection, localisation, and segmentation of solder joint defects. Further research is required to complete the full system including the classification of solder joint defects.

Addressing this {{challenge will be}} {{critical to the success}} of these missions. As a result, it is necessary to consider new approaches to spacecraft maintenance and repair that reduce the need for large replacement components. Currently, crew members on the International Space Station (ISS) recover from faults by removing and replacing, using backup systems, or living without the function of Orbital Replacement Units (ORUs). These ORUs are returned to a depot where the root cause of the failure is determined and the ORU is repaired. The crew has some limited repair capability with the Modulation/DeModulation (MDM) ORU, where circuit cards are removed and replace in faulty units. The next step to reducing the size of the items being replaced would be to implement component-level repair. This mode of repair has been implemented by the U. S. Navy in an operational environment and is now part of their standard approach for maintenance. It is appropriate to consider whether this approach can be adapted for future spaceflight operations.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{properties}} of Si 3 N 4 substrate material with AMB (active metal brazing) copper conductor. A recently developed type of tape casted, gas pressure sintered silicon nitride ceramic with a three times higher thermal conductivity than known from typical standard silicon nitride materials and with good flexural strength was applied. The increase of thermal conductivity {{is the result of}} using different species of sintering aids and the optimization of their ratio in the material. The high bending strength allows creating a thinner substrate compared to other standard ceramic materials for power electronics, e. g. aluminum nitride. This reduction in thickness leads to a decrease of the total thermal resistance of the substrate which improves heat dissipation. For the AMB process a silver based active brazing solder composition optimized for Silicon Nitride was used. This optimization could be obtained by an investigation of the physical and chemical interactions between the brazing and the base material. A void free <b>joint</b> without short <b>circuits</b> between adjacent structures could be formed. The copper surface can be coated on demand with Nickel or Nickel/Gold for improved solderability and wire bondability as well as for corrosion protection. The silicon nitride substrate with AMB copper conductor lines and fully covered back side ground shows a higher reliability than comparable substrates made out of common, well known ceramic materials. The heat dissipation is comparable with conventional AMB substrates made of high thermal conductive ceramic such as Aluminum Nitride, but thermal cycling behavior exceeds the limits well known from AlN-AMB or AlN-DCB...|$|R
40|$|As {{conventional}} lead solders {{are being}} replaced by Pb-free solders in electronic devices, the reliability of solder <b>joints</b> in integrated <b>circuits</b> (ICs) has become a high concern. Due to the miniaturization of ICs and consequently solder joints, the current density through the solder interconnects has increased causing electrical damage known as electromigration. Electromigration, atomic and mass migration due to high electron currents, {{is one of the}} most urgent reliability issues delaying the implementation of Pb-free solder materials in electronic devices. The research on Pb-free solders has mainly focused on the qualitative understanding of failure by electromigration. There has been little progress however, on the quantitative analysis of electromigration because of the lack of available material parameters, such as the effective charge, (z*), the driving force for electromigration. The research herein uses idealized interconnects to measure the z* of electromigration of Cu in Sn- 3. 0 Ag- 0. 5 Cu (SAC 305) alloy under different experimental conditions. Planar SAC 305 interconnects were sandwiched between two Cu pads and subject to uniaxial current. The crystallographic orientation of Sn in these samples were characterized with electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and wavelength dispersive spectroscopy (WDS) before and after electromigration testing. Results indicate that samples with the c-axis aligned perpendicular to current flow, polycrystalline, and those with a diffusion barrier on the cathode side all inhibit the growth of intermetallic compounds (IMC). The effective charge values of Cu in SAC 305 under the different conditions tested were quantified for the first time and included in this dissertation. The following research is expected to help verify and improve the electromigration model and identify the desirable conditions to inhibit damage by electromigration in Pb-free solder joints...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} {{structure}} of precision motion system built {{on the basis of}} a circular multi-coordinate synchronous segment motor and reconfigurable parallel kinematic mechanism. The multi-coordinate synchronous segment motor may have from two to six movable segments depending on the design, and number of the segments generally defines an internal mobility of the motor. A specific feature of the parallel kinematic mechanism consists in the possibility of its structure reconfiguration by serial connection of two neighboring rods with the help of free elements of their spherical <b>joints</b> into triangular <b>circuits</b> with one spherical hinge at the common vertex. As result of this, the controlled motion of motor movable segments is transformed into the complex spatial displacement of circular platform with number of degrees of freedom up to six inclusively. A mathematical model for solution of the kinematic problem in the investigated parallel mechanism has been offered in the paper. The model allows to calculate a position of movable segments of multi-coordinate synchronous motor depending on the desired position and orientation of the executive circular platform. The parametric definition of base point positions in the motor segments in time allows eventually to form algorithms of programmable motions. The paper substantiates ability to embed the developed motion system into projection unit of opto-mechanical equipment while preserving traditional configuration scheme. This provides the possibility of adaptive adjustment of optical elements during operation; it allows to adjust the optical elements when the geometry of projection system is changed due to deterioration. As result, main characteristics of projection system: resolution, depth of field and image contrast and distortion are maintained at the required level. The developed motion system can be used as a coordinate system of positioning, alignment and scanning in the assembly and other precision equipment.  </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to evaluate a 1600 -pound, six-legged, gasoline- powered, self-contained, man-carrying, hydraulically-actuated, walking ma-chine built by Sutherland, Sproull and Associates. We were interested in the task of programming the control computer, the problems of operator control, and the performance of the vehicle. The walking machine presents two technical problems. The first is how best to permit the operator to control it. A control stick and two foot pedals provide operator inputs, and we connected them in various ways to give the driver control of the machine's path, direction, and speed. In addition, we experimented with different algorithms to select the particular uses of particular legs. The second technical problem posed by the walking machine comes about be-cause of the topology of the hydraulic circuits that actuate it. Rather than using a separate servomechanism for each <b>joint,</b> the hydraulic <b>circuits</b> of this machine permit actuators from several of its joints to be made a part of a single hydraulic circuit. Parallel connections of actuators permit leg to share load equally; series connections force them to move synchronously.

40|$|The {{long-term}} {{goal of this}} research is to assist {{in the development of a}} fast, accurate, and low-cost nondestructive inspection prototype for solder <b>joints</b> in integrated <b>circuits</b> (IC). The goal of the work described in this thesis is to develop a fully automated system to maintain the signal strength of the vibrometer that would reduce the testing time while maintaining or improving the quality of the defect detection results. The ability to perform the inspections in an automated manner is very important in order to demonstrate the ability of the defect detection system to be used for online inspection without the need of an operator. The system was able to find the maximum signal strength (at a single point on the surface of a flip chip) nearly five times faster than Polytec's commercial system with a search time of approximately 2. 1 sec. When integrated into the nondestructive inspection prototype, the system described in this work was found to approximately reduce the data acquisition time per test location by four times, with a minimum data acquisition time of 8. 5 sec and an average time of 15. 4 sec, while maintaining the same level of quality of results obtained by a skilled operator when manually maintaining the signal strength of the vibrometer. Hardware was developed that retrofitted a vibrometer's focusing head at the end of a fiber optic cable to a motorized linear stage. This stage controlled the standoff distance between the focusing head and the IC's surface with a fixed focal length, which allowed the spot size of the laser to be adjusted while searching for a desired signal strength. Numerous tests were conducted to determine the search parameters, which led to a search time of approximately 2. 1 sec. This time was found to be dependent on the surface finish of the IC being inspected. It was also found that to achieve a desired signal intensity strength, not only does the standoff height of the focusing head, which determines the laser spot size, need to be controlled, but also the exact location on which the laser is reflecting off the IC.

40|$|Solder <b>joints</b> on printed <b>circuit</b> boards provide {{electrical}} and mechanical connections between electronic devices and metallized patterns on boards. These solder joints {{are often the}} cause of failure in electronic packages. Solders age under storage and operational life conditions, which can include temperature, mechanical loads, and electrical current. Aging occurring at a constant temperature is called isothermal aging. Isothermal aging leads to coarsening of the bulk microstructure and increased interfacial intermetallic compounds at the solder-pad interface. The coarsening of the solder bulk degrades the creep properties of solders, whereas the voiding and brittleness of interfacial intermetallic compounds leads to mechanical weakness of the solder joint. Industry guidelines on solder interconnect reliability test methods recommend preconditioning the solder assemblies by isothermal aging before conducting reliability tests. The guidelines assume that isothermal aging simulates a "reasonable use period," but do not relate the isothermal aging levels with specific use conditions. Studies {{on the effect of}} isothermal aging on the thermal cycling reliability of tin-lead and tin-silver-copper solders are limited in scope, and results have been contradictory. The effect of electrical current on solder joints has been has mostly focused on current densities above 104 A/cm 2 with high ambient temperature (&# 8805; 100 oC), where electromigration, thermomigration, and Joule heating are the dominant failure mechanisms. The effect of current density below 104 A/cm 2 on temperature cycling fatigue of solders has not been established. This research provides the relation between isothermal aging and the thermal cycling reliability of select Sn-based solders. The Sn-based solders with 3 %, 1 %, and 0 % silver content that have replaced tin-lead are studied and compared against tin-lead solder. The activation energy and growth exponents of the Arrhenius model for the intermetallic growth in the solders are provided. An aging metric to quantify the aging of solder joints, in terms of phase size in the solder bulk and interfacial intermetallic compound thickness at the solder-pad interface, is established. Based on the findings of thermal cycling tests on aged solder assemblies, recommendations are made for isothermal aging of solders before thermal cycling tests. Additionally, the effect of active electrical current at 103 A/cm 2 on thermal cycling reliability is reported...|$|R
