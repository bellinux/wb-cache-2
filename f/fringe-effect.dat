5000|$|Capacitance probe, or fringe {{capacitance}} sensor. Capacitance probes use capacitance {{to measure the}} dielectric permittivity of the soil. The volume {{of water in the}} total volume of soil most heavily influences the dielectric permittivity of the soil because the dielectric of water (80) is much greater than the other constituents of the soil (mineral soil: 4, organic matter: 4, air: 1). Thus, when the amount of water changes in the soil, the probe will measure a change in capacitance (from the change in dielectric permittivity) that can be directly correlated with a change in water content. Circuitry inside some commercial probes change the capacitance measurement into a proportional millivolt output. Other configuration are like the neutron probe where an access tube made of PVC is installed in the soil. The probe consists of sensing head at fixed depth. The sensing head consists of an oscillator circuit, the frequency is determined by an annular electrode, <b>fringe-effect</b> capacitor, and the dielectric constant of the soil.|$|E
50|$|Capacitance sensors (or Dielectric sensors) use {{capacitance}} {{to measure}} the dielectric permittivity of a surrounding medium. The configuration is like the neutron probe where an access tube made of PVC is installed in the soil; probes can also be modular (comb-like) and connected to a logger. The sensing head consists of an oscillator circuit, the frequency is determined by an annular electrode, <b>fringe-effect</b> capacitor, and the dielectric constant of the soil. Each capacitor sensor consists of two metal rings mounted on the circuit board at {{some distance from the}} top of the access tube. These rings are a pair of electrodes, which form the plates of the capacitor with the soil acting as the dielectric in between. The plates are connected to an oscillator, consisting of an inductor and a capacitor. The oscillating electrical field is generated between the two rings and extends into the soil medium through the wall of the access tube. The capacitor and the oscillator form a circuit, and changes in dielectric constant of surrounding media are detected by changes in the operating frequency. The capacitance sensors are designed to oscillate in excess of 100 MHz inside the access tube in free air. The output of the sensor is the frequency response of the soilâ€™s capacitance due to its soil moisture level.|$|E
40|$|Context. The first {{magnetic}} fields in O- and B-type stars {{that do not}} belong to the Bp-star class, have been discovered. The cyclic UV wind-line variability, which has been observed in a significant fraction of early-type stars, is likely to be related to such {{magnetic fields}}. Aims. We attempt to improve our understanding of massive-star magnetic fields, and observe twenty-five carefully-selected, OB-type stars. Methods. Of these stars we obtain 136 magnetic field strength measurements. We present the UV wind-line variability of all selected targets and summarise spectropolarimetric observations acquired using the MUSICOS spectropolarimeter, mounted at the TBL, Pic du Midi, between December 1998 and November 2004. From the average Stokes I and V line profiles, derived using the LSD method, we measure the magnetic field strengths, radial velocities, and first moment of the line profiles. Results. No significant magnetic field is detected in any OB-type star that we observed. Typical 1 sigma errors are between 15 and 200 G. A possible magnetic-field detection for the O 9 V star 10 Lac remains uncertain, because the field measurements depend critically on the <b>fringe-effect</b> correction in the Stokes V spectra. We find excess emission in UV-wind lines, centred about the rest wavelength, to be a new indirect indicator of the presence of a magnetic field in early B-type stars. The most promising candidates to host magnetic fields are the B-type stars delta Cet and 6 Cep, and a number of O stars. Conclusions. Although some O and B stars have strong dipolar field, which cause periodic variability in the UV wind-lines, such strong fields are not widespread. If the variability observed in the UV wind-lines of OB stars is generally caused by surface magnetic fields, these fields are either weak (less than or similar to few hundred G) or localised...|$|E
