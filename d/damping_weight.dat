40|$|A multi-objective optimal design {{methodology}} is developed for light-weight, low-cost composite structures of improved dynamic performance. The design objectives include minimization of resonance amplitudes (or maximization of modal <b>damping),</b> <b>weight,</b> and material cost. The design vector includes micromechanics, laminate, and structural shape parameters. Performance constraints are imposed on static displacements, dynamic amplitudes, and natural frequencies. The effects of damping on {{the dynamics of}} composite structures are incorporated. Preliminary applications on a cantilever composite beam illustrated that only the proposed multi-objective optimization, as opposed to single objective functions, simultaneously improved all objectives.

40|$|An {{optimization}} analysis study {{concerning the}} damping control of ship's cabin noise {{was carried out}} in order to improve the effect and reduce the weight of damping. Based on the Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) method, a theoretical deduction and numerical analysis of the first-order sensitivity analysis of the A-weighted sound pressure level concerning the damping loss factor of the subsystem were carried out. On this basis, a mathematical optimization model was proposed and an optimization program developed. Next, the secondary development of VA One software was implemented through the use of MATLAB, while the cabin noise damping control layout optimization system was established. Finally, the optimization model of the ship was constructed and numerical experiments of damping control optimization conducted. The damping installation region was divided into five parts with different damping thicknesses. The total weight of damping was set as an objective function and the A-weighted sound pressure level of the target cabin was set as a constraint condition. The best damping thickness was obtained through the optimization program, and the total <b>damping</b> <b>weight</b> was reduced by 60. 4 %. The results show that the damping noise reduction effect of unit weight is significantly improved through the optimization method.

40|$|Friction dampers {{have been}} used to reduce turbine blade {{vibration}} levels for a considerable period of time. However, optimal design of these dampers has been quite difficult due both to a lack of adequate theoretical predictions and to difficulties in conducting reliable experiments. One of the difficulties of <b>damper</b> <b>weight</b> optimisation via the experimental route has been the inevitable effects of mistuning. Also, conducting separate experiments for different <b>damper</b> <b>weights</b> involves excessive cost. Therefore, current practice in the turbomachinery industry has been to conduct so-called 'rainbow tests' where friction dampers with different weights are placed between blades with a predefined configuration.

The bell is hollow and the damper cable is fixed internally to the distal end, which permits relative motion between the cable and <b>damping</b> <b>weights.</b> To provide for greater freedom of motion, the weights may be partially slotted in the vertical plane, allowing the cable to travel outside {{the confines of}} the bell. In some installations, the weights are unequal, allowing damping over a greater frequency range.

The differences in weight was used to tally the humidity level. Other techniques were applied using mass to measure humidity such as when the air was dry, the bar of charcoal would be light while the air was humid, the bar of charcoal would be heavy. By hanging a lump of earth and a bar of charcoal on the two ends of a staff separately and adding a fixated lifting string on the middle point to make the staff horizontal in dry air, an ancient hygrometer was made.|$|R

40|$|Obstacle {{avoidance}} can {{be achieved}} as a secondary task by appropriate inverse kinematics (IK) resolution of redundant manipulators. Most prior literature requires the time-consuming determination of the closest point to the obstacle for every calculation step. Aiming at the relief of computational burden, this paper develops what is termed a backward quadratic search algorithm (BQSA) as another option for solving IK problems in obstacle avoidance. The BQSA detects possible collisions based on the root property of a category of quadratic functions, which are derived from ellipse-enveloped obstacles and the positions of each link’s end-points. The algorithm executes a backward search for possible obstacle collisions, from the end-effector to the base, and avoids obstacles by utilizing a hybrid IK scheme, incorporating the damped least-squares method, the weighted least-norm method and the gradient projection method. Some details of the hybrid IK scheme, such as values of the <b>damped</b> factor, <b>weights</b> and the clamping velocity, are discussed, along with a comparison of computational load between previous methods and BQSA.

40|$|In {{computing}} {{the dynamic}} response of a connected system with multiple components having dissimilar damping characteristics, {{which is often}} referred to as nonclassically damped system such as nuclear power plant piping systems supported by stiff structures, one needs to define the system-level damping based upon the damping information of components.

However, when the difference in damping among components is substantial, the composite modal damping may become inappropriate in the characterization of the damping behavior of such systems. In recent years, several new methods have emerged with the expectation that they could produce more exact system-level damping for a group of nonclassically damped structures which are comprised of components that possess classical modal damping. In this paper, an overview is presented to examine these methods in the light of their theoretical basis, the technical merits, and practical applications.

A simple model comparison suggests that the answer is 'not yet'. The effect of BDKs on both the pattern and the amplitude of mantle wavespeed perturbations appears to be smaller than that of practical (and subjective) considerations (such as the level of <b>damping,</b> the <b>weighting</b> of different data sets, and the choice of data fit) and does not exceed realistic estimates of image uncertainty due to, for instance, errors in the data. By itself, the fact that the better theory has not yet resulted in significant model improvements does not imply that models based on BDKs are incorrect.

Moving loads induced by two standard AASHTO trucks were developed through a specific load-time history, applied on 35 nodes on the superstructure. To study the dynamic behavior of the bridge under a moving load, a modal analysis followed by an implicit dynamic analysis was carried out. Acceptable agreement was found between the field measurements and FE simulation. Most concerned dynamic response was strains at different locations in bridge girders and columns, because it is the only critical parameter that can be measured with confidence during SHM at site. The range of strains determined in analysis was reasonably close to the measured strains {{at the site of the}} study bridge. Several parameters including <b>damping,</b> truck <b>weight</b> and speed, and material properties were studied.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} presented is to study effects extracted from biologically active peat substances on carbohydrate accumulation processes. The study was carried out on 5 -year-old Siberian stone pine seedlings grown in the nursery forest in the southern part of the Tomsk region. These seedlings were treated with a peat preparation, which was created in Tomsk. Four groups of experimental plants were organized on the analog principle.  Each group consisted of 30 seedlings of average size and half of these seedlings were control. At the beginning of the vegetative season, a single treatment was applied to experimental plants with water solution peat preparation.  The first group of plants was treated with a 0. 1 % solution; the dose was calculated by dry substance. For the second group, the dose was increased by 25 %. For the third and fourth groups, the dose was decreased by 25 % relative to the first group. Control plants were sprayed with water. Accumulation of carbohydrates and pigments as well as growth values in the 2 -year- old needles were studied by standard methods. Glucose levels in the experimental plants existed within the limits 117 - 120 %. On the whole, simple sugar quantity did not differs between experimental variants. Glucose synthesis was accompanied by changes in quantitative values of fructose.  This, connected with glucose being a more stable compound, and compulsory conversion from glucose to labile form fructose was necessary.  The amount of fructose in the experimental seedlings had a very wide range. This process was accompanied by shoot elongation in Siberian stone pine in the first year after treatment, with the fructose amount of 14 % exceeding control values in the first and fourth group. Shoot growth was accompanied by increased fructose amount to 20 % relative to control. A similar situation was observed after winter with respect to buds. Experimental plants dominated by number of buds. After the winter quiescent period, potential main bud realized as growth of shoot. Probably, fructose was used in the growth process of shoots and in the period when buds were laid. The fructose content in the seedling needle increased when the growth rate of above-ground shoots decreased. Sucrose is a universal source for synthesis of all organic compounds; it keeps it inert, and it is important when sucrose is transported through the plant vascular systems.  Sucrose is a reserve carbohydrate. In the first variant, significant sucrose decrease compensated for increased fructose amount. Possibly, sucrose was used intensively, namely for growth processes of above-ground shoots, or at least, none of the experimental variant sucrose amounts exceeded control values. Existence of a close connection was discovered between the content of chlorophyll and the amount of carbohydrate. Maximum amount of chlorophyll 'a' was displayed in the first group (529. 32  μg/g <b>damp</b> <b>weights</b> vs. control 467. 20 μg/g).  Pigment is responsive to changes in environmental conditions, therefore it substantially determines growth and development processes of plants. It is necessary to note that pigment  amounts did not exceed the upper limit of physiological norms in all experimental groups. Changes were observed in needle length. This is connected with leaf apparatus treated plants. Opportunity was taken for extra concentrated sugars and other photosynthesis products in the needle. Thus, the natural growth regulator that the plant possessed had a prolonged effect and influence on physiological parameters of leaves such as carbohydrate accumulation. Correlation between photosynthetic pigments, carbohydrate accumulation, dynamic and growth processes was discovered. </p...|$|R

As far as the performances of damping treatments are concerned, the optimal design of sandwich structures has become an important research field. In this work, an optimal design approach for choosing the most suitable material for high damping and low mass for a sandwich beam is investigated. Two frequency dependent visco-elastic materials (PVB and 3 M ISD 112) are considered. The damping characteristics (eigenfrequencies and damping ratios) of the sandwich beam are determined by solving a non-linear eigenvalue problem. A multi-objective optimization approach based on evolutionary algorithms is used to find the Pareto surface that minimizes the mass and maximizes the damping. The optimization variables are the thicknesses of the visco-elastic and elastic layers. The total beam thickness is kept constant and its maximal deflection under its own weight is limited to its thickness.

The theoretical analysis proposes two different methods to evaluate damping: classical and finite element method. In view of any discrepancy in results, experiments are conducted for different sets of mild steel specimens under different vibrating conditions. Time domain approach has been adopted to evaluate experimentally the damping capacity of the fixed-fixed beams. Both the numerical and experimental results are compared for authentication. Finally, useful conclusions have been drawn from both the numerical and experimental results. ...|$|R
