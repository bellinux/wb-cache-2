5|$|Amis drew upon {{a holiday}} <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> in the Greek islands {{to create a}} {{realistic}} Greek setting and characters. He emphasised political intrigue in the plot more than Fleming had done in the canonical Bond novels, also adding revenge to Bond's motivations by including M's kidnapping. Despite keeping a format and structure similar to Fleming's Bond novels, Colonel Sun was given mixed reviews.|$|E
5|$|Barnes lingered for {{a further}} ten minutes on 96 before {{reaching}} his century with a straight drive from Laker. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> 255 minutes and hit ten fours. After registering his century, Barnes became particularly aggressive. Barnes stepped out to attack Laker but missed; luckily for him, Evans failed to collect the ball as it turned down the leg side.|$|E

Up to that point, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> charge of two games in the qualifying competition, including Wales' home game against Spain the previous April. Although regarded highly enough by FIFA to be chosen for the 1984 Olympic Final, he {{had a reputation for}} being strict in his interpretation of the rules.|$|E
5|$|Leaving {{his family}} behind, {{he was allowed}} to pass into the Austrian-ruled Banat, before moving into self-exile in France while his wife and {{children}} were sent to Ottoman lands. In 1850–1851, several of his memoirs of the revolution, written in both Romanian and French, were published in Paris, the city where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> residence. He shared his exile with Tell and Magheru, as well as with Nicolae Rusu Locusteanu.|$|E

5|$|The {{belief of}} many {{followers}} that their founder was {{the incarnation of}} the Supreme God has also drawn criticism. According to Professor Raymond B. Williams, Swaminarayan was criticized because he received large gifts from his followers and dressed and traveled as a Maharaja even though <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> the vows of renunciation of the world. Swaminarayan responded that he accepts gifts for the emancipation of his followers.|$|E
5|$|The {{first meeting}} of local {{commercial}} and political interests to establish a bridge across Skarnsund was held in 1972. By 1983, it was formalized by {{the establishment of the}} company ASSkarnsundsbrua to finance construction. The Parliament of Norway passed the plans in 1986, and construction started two years later. The bridge cost NOK200 million, and was opened by King Harald V on 19 December 1991, after <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> the last ferry across the fjord.|$|E
5|$|Uribe began 2013 as {{a utility}} player. However, he made {{frequent}} starts at third base, and by June, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> over the position. On July 5, Uribe had seven RBIs {{and was a}} single short of hitting for the cycle in a 10–2 victory over the Giants.|$|E

5|$|After the {{publication}} of Go Quietly, Agnew largely disappeared from public view. In a rare TV interview in 1980, he advised young people not to go into politics because too much was expected of those in high public office. In 1983 a Maryland court ordered him to pay the state the sum of $268,000, including interest and penalties, {{the sum of the}} bribes <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> while a public employee. Agnew did not dispute the judgement, but seven years later applied unsuccessfully for this sum to be treated as tax-deductible. He was briefly in the news in 1987, when as the plaintiff in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, he gave the public some insight into his recent business activities.|$|E
5|$|Albrecht stated his {{original}} {{aim was to}} draw attention to the law, not to have Knut put down. In December 2006 <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> legal action against Leipzig Zoo to prevent them from killing a sloth bear cub rejected by its mother. His case was dismissed on the grounds that humans raising the animal would have been against the law of nature. In response to the criticism against him, Albrecht said that he was merely drawing parallels between the two cubs. The publicity from this coverage raised Knut's profile from national to international.|$|E
5|$|As Vizier <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> all powers {{under his}} control as {{the king was}} only a puppet, a figurehead, who was into enjoying life with wine, opium and women. But he {{overestimated}} and over exercised his powers {{with the result that}} the Emperor’s family called their Hindu Maratha confederacy to help them get rid of their Vizier. A civil strife ensued and eventually in 1753 Safdarjung was driven out of Delhi. He died soon thereafter in 1754. After his death his son Nawab Shujaud Daula pleaded with the Mughal Emperor to permit him to erect a tomb for his father in Delhi. He then built the tomb, which was designed by an Abyssininan architect.|$|E

5|$|Aston's {{return to}} England in late 1626, {{along with all}} the Catholic settlers, failed to deter Baltimore, who finally sailed for Newfoundland in 1627, {{arriving}} on 23 July and staying only two months before returning to England. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> both Protestant and Catholic settlers with him, as well as two secular priests, Thomas Longville and Anthony Pole (also known as Smith), the latter remaining behind in the colony when Baltimore departed for England. The land Baltimore had seen was by no means the paradise described by some early settlers, being only marginally productive; as the summer climate was deceptively mild, his brief visit gave Baltimore no reason to alter his plans for the colony.|$|E
5|$|Bone Sharps, Cowboys, and Thunder Lizards: A Tale of Edward Drinker Cope, Othniel Charles Marsh, and the Gilded Age of Paleontology (2005) is {{a graphic}} novel written by Jim Ottaviani and {{illustrated}} by the company Big Time Attic. The book tells a slightly fictionalized account of the Bone Wars, a period of intense excavation, speculation, and rivalry {{which led to a}} greater understanding of dinosaurs in the western United States. This novel is the first semi-fictional work written by Ottaviani; previously, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> no creative license with the characters he depicted, portraying them strictly according to historical sources.|$|E
5|$|By some accounts, Smith {{had been}} {{teaching}} a polygamy doctrine {{as early as}} 1831, and there is unconfirmed evidence that Smith was a polygamist by 1835. Although the church had publicly repudiated polygamy, in 1837 there was a rift between Smith and Oliver Cowdery over the issue. Cowdery suspected Smith had engaged {{in a relationship with}} his serving girl, Fanny Alger. Smith never denied a relationship, but insisted it was not adulterous, presumably because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> Alger as a plural wife.|$|E

5|$|Castles {{served a}} range of purposes, the most {{important}} of which were military, administrative, and domestic. As well as defensive structures, castles were also offensive tools which {{could be used as a}} base of operations in enemy territory. Castles were established by Norman invaders of England for both defensive purposes and to pacify the country's inhabitants. As William the Conqueror advanced through England, he fortified key positions to secure the land <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken.</b> Between 1066 and 1087, he established 36castles such as Warwick Castle, which he used to guard against rebellion in the English Midlands.|$|E
5|$|China has had {{an organ}} {{transplantation}} programme since the 1960s. It {{is one of the}} largest organ transplant programmes in the world, peaking at over 13,000 transplants a year in 2004. Involuntary organ harvesting is illegal under Chinese law, although under a 1984 regulation it became legal to remove organs from executed criminals with the prior consent of the criminal or permission of relatives. By the 1990s, growing concerns about possible ethical abuses arising from coerced consent and corruption led medical groups and human rights organizations to start condemning the practice. These concerns resurfaced in 2001, when The Washington Post reported claims by a Chinese asylum-seeking doctor that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> part in organ extraction operations.|$|E

Corral, Wyatt {{testified that he}} offered the US$3,600 in Wells Fargo reward money ($1,200 per robber) to Ike Clanton and Frank McLaury in return for {{information}} about the identities of the three robbers. Wyatt testified that he had other motives for his plan, as well; he hoped that arresting the murderers would boost his chances for election as Cochise County sheriff. Wyatt told the court that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> the extra step of obtaining a second copy of a telegram for Ike from Wells Fargo assuring that the reward for capturing the killers applied either dead or alive.|$|E
