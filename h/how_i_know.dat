500|$|Cinema Blend Amanda Krill said Stevens' wig {{looked like}} a [...] "Stepford Wives wig", adding: [...] "Everyone {{has a hard time}} not looking at it. She's still a cancer patient, but she knows that her job is on the line just like {{everyone}} else's. Everyone is working round the clock, showing up at every call, and the Chief is acting like a maniacal overlord." [...] Krill also enjoyed Oh's performance as Yang, writing: [...] "Cristina dealing with children is almost laughable – and actually provides a chuckle or two in this tense episode. Miss C thinks she is striking gold by moving to peds, because she {{will be able to do}} all types of surgery, and on little people, which makes the surgery harder, which is of course, better. Things don't turn out as planned, though, when she realizes kids are a little more resilient than their adult counterparts. And then Callie outs her to Arizona – in the she doesn’t really like kids sense of outing." [...] Krill enjoyed Wilson's performance as Bailey, in addition to Dane's, writing: [...] "He wins the best line of the show with 'That’s <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> my job is safe, Yang – I reattach babies arms.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Recording {{the album}} soon became an {{obsession}} to Parker, {{as he worked}} [...] "all day, every day," [...] growing increasingly isolated. He said, [...] "At some point, life outside the studio fades into the distance. That's <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that I'm into it." [...] He reasoned that any alternate approach would imply that the music was not powerful enough. Pitchfork writer Corban Goble described Parker's daily routine in an article shortly preceding the album's release: [...] "During the making of an album, the 29-year-old generally likes to rise around midday and then work, slowly and methodically, {{late into the night}} while drinking and smoking." [...] Parker contended this approach helped his writing, noting, [...] "Things flow easier — the flow {{is the most important thing}} for me for recording." [...] He also often went swimming during breaks, which he dubbed [...] "the ultimate purifier." [...] He followed a mantra of [...] "give the song what it deserves," [...] which entailed creating music without [...] "any sensible or logical decisions." [...] Parker recorded dozens of vocals takes; according to him, for one song, he performed over 1,056 partial vocal takes. For one week, he rented another house located four hours south of Perth—the same one where he recorded Innerspeaker—to brainstorm drum ideas for songs.|$|E

6000|$|Again: [...] "I fancy that God {{ought to}} be good. But <b>how</b> do <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that He really is good? I see the world full of injustice, and misery, and death. <b>How</b> do <b>I</b> <b>know</b> {{that this is not}} God's doing, God's fault in some way?" ...|$|R
