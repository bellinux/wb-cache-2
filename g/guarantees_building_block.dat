The main goal is to provide <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> that cooperate to sense the availability of and deploy distinct QoS capabilities {{in order to accomplish}} adaptive end-to-end service <b>guarantees.</b> The <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> needed in a heterogeneous IP network will be introduced and discussed with respect to safety from abuse of total networking bandwidth, CPU, and memory usage. In conjunction with a new safety hierarchy and a sandbox environment for active-code execution, security risks can be bounded to the level of traditional IP forwarding, control, and management. In particular, the problem of QoSparameter translation to provide end-to-end service guarantees is addressed, and an example using Diffserv, RSVP, and GPRS in a heterogeneous network is given...|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} {{complexity of}} metamaterials is limitless, although in practice, most designs comprise periodic architectures {{which lead to}} materials with spatially homogeneous features. More advanced tasks, arising in e. g. soft robotics, prosthetics and wearable tech, involve spatially textured mechanical functionality which require aperiodic architectures. However, a naïve implementation of such structural complexity invariably leads to frustration, which prevents coherent operation and impedes functionality. Here we introduce a combinatorial strategy {{for the design of}} aperiodic yet frustration-free mechanical metamaterials, whom we show to exhibit spatially textured functionalities. We implement this strategy using cubic <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> - voxels - which deform anisotropically, a local stacking rule which allows cooperative shape changes by <b>guaranteeing</b> that deformed <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> fit as in a 3 D jigsaw puzzle, and 3 D printing. We show that, first, these aperiodic metamaterials exhibit long-range holographic order, where the 2 D pixelated surface texture dictates the 3 D interior voxel arrangement. Second, they act as programmable shape shifters, morphing into spatially complex but predictable and designable shapes when uniaxially compressed. Third, their mechanical response to compression by a textured surface reveals their ability to perform sensing and pattern analysis. Combinatorial design thus opens a new avenue towards mechanical metamaterials with unusual order and machine-like functionalities. Comment: Main text: 5 p, 3 figs.

40|$|ABSTRACT We have {{previously}} presented a <b>building</b> <b>block</b> folding model. The model postulates that protein folding is a hierarchical top-down process. The basic unit {{from which a}} fold is constructed, {{referred to as a}} hydrophobic folding unit, is the outcome of combinatorial assembly of a set of “building blocks. ” Results obtained by the computational cutting procedure yield fragments that are in agreement with those obtained experimentally by limited proteolysis. Here we show that as expected, proteins from the same family give very similar <b>building</b> <b>blocks.</b> However, different proteins can also give <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> that are similar in structure. In such cases the <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> differ in sequence, stability, contacts with other <b>building</b> <b>blocks,</b> and in their 3 D locations in the protein structure. This result, which we have repeatedly observed in many cases, leads us to conclude that while a <b>building</b> <b>block</b> is influenced by its environment, nevertheless, it {{can be viewed as a}} standalone unit. For small-sized <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> existing in multiple conformations, interactions with sister <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> in the protein will increase the population time of the native conformer. With this conclusion in hand, it is possible to develop an algorithm that predicts the <b>building</b> <b>block</b> assignment of a protein sequence whose structure is unknown. Toward this goal, we have created sequentially nonredundant databases of <b>building</b> <b>block</b> sequences.

40|$|Abstract- The <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> {{are common}} {{structures}} of high-quality solutions. Genetic algorithms often assume the building-block hypothesis. It is {{hypothesized that the}} high-quality solutions are composed of <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> and the solution quality can be improved by composing <b>building</b> <b>blocks.</b> The studies of <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> are limited to some artificial optimization functions {{in which it is}} obvious that the <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> exist.

We test the building-block hypothesis with 15 -bit onemax, 5 × 3 -trap, parabola 1 − (x 2 / 10 10), and two-dimensional Euclidian traveling salesman problem (TSP). The building-block hypothesis holds for onemax, 5 × 3 -trap, and parabola. In the case of parabola, Gray coding gives a higher quantity of <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> than that of binary coding.
