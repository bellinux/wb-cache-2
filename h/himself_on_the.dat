Jones' return to the first XI, resulted in him finding <b>himself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> score sheet in a 2–0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers. Initial reports that his form had inclined manager, Russell Slade to open contract talks with him and the club in the final months of 2015 {{turned out to be}} untrue.|$|E

5|$|As {{a member}} of the Saint Petersburg music scene, Prokofiev {{developed}} a reputation as a musical rebel, while getting praise for his original compositions, which he performed <b>himself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> piano.

He continued at the Conservatory, studying piano under Anna Yesipova and continuing his conducting lessons under Tcherepnin.|$|E

5|$|Shaughnessy mentored {{middle linebacker}} Bill George as the {{defensive}} play-caller. Bears coach Abe Gibron likened George to having Shaughnessy <b>himself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> field.

He emphasized man-to-man coverage, dropped linebackers or defensive ends into pass coverage, and utilized blitzes from multiple directions—which had previously consisted mostly of just a middle linebacker.|$|E

5|$|After {{spending}} {{eight months}} {{without being able}} to play any football, Villa finally returned from his injury in the 73rd minute of Barcelona's 2–0 win over Dinamo Bucharest on 11 August 2012. Eight days later, he played his first competitive football match since December 2011 in Barcelona's first La Liga game of the season where he received a standing ovation while coming on as a substitute for Pedro. It only took seven minutes before Villa found <b>himself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> score-sheet while sealing a 5–1 victory for his team against Real Sociedad.

5|$|As Sayid and John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) {{discuss the}} attack on Sayid, Locke {{suggests}} that Sawyer is the culprit, since he is doing well for <b>himself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island, hoarding other people's possessions, and also seems to dislike Sayid. Meanwhile, Shannon begins to have trouble breathing due to her lack of medication and panic resulting from this problem. Jack tries beating answers out of Sawyer by punching him, but stops when he sees others' disapproval. Then with Jack's approval, Sayid ties Sawyer to a tree and tortures him for answers, revealing that he has tortured people before.|$|E
5|$|As {{the team}} {{advanced}} to the front, they were brought under heavy enemy rifle, grenade and mortar fire. Just as the three had reached the front lines, a Japanese grenade landed among them. It {{was less than a}} foot from the two Marines with PFC Gonsalves. Without a moment's hesitation, he flung <b>himself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grenade, taking the full explosion into his own body. He gallantly gave his life for his fellow Marines and his country. The other two were not even touched by grenade fragments and they successfully completed their mission.|$|E

5|$|Convinced of Barclay's claims, the Doctor {{prepares to}} destroy the ship when Chakotay (Robert Beltran) arrives and gives an {{alternative}} story: The Doctor is indeed the Voyager EMH, but his program is stuck in the malfunctioning holodeck. The crew is trying to extricate his program so he only needs to wait it out; if he destroys the ship as Barclay suggests, it will prematurely end {{the program and the}} Doctor will be lost. Even though Barclay introduces Kes (Jennifer Lien) as Zimmerman's wife, the Doctor finally opts to believe in his holographic existence. The simulation ends and the Doctor finds <b>himself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> holodeck; Chakotay's story was true and the Doctor is safely returned to sickbay.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey and Maud's oldest granddaughter, Joan, married Roger Mortimer in 1301, giving Mortimer {{control of}} Ludlow Castle. Around 1320, Roger built the Great Chamber block {{alongside}} the existing Great Hall and Solar complex, copying what {{was becoming a}} popular tripartite design for domestic castle buildings in the 14th century; an additional building was also constructed by Roger on {{the location of the}} later Tudor Lodgings, and the Guardrobe Tower was added to the curtain wall. Between 1321 and 1322 Mortimer found <b>himself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> losing side of the Despenser War and, after being imprisoned by Edward II, he escaped from the Tower of London in 1323 into exile.|$|E

On 6July he encamped at Burgh by Sands, {{just south of}} the Scottish border. When his servants came the next morning to lift him up so that he could eat, he died in their arms.|$|E

5|$|In early 1950, Saville {{served on}} the Guided Missiles Interdepartmental Operational Requirements Group (GMIORG), a {{military}} and civilian committee tasked with the coordination of research on guided missiles, {{as well as the}} development of tactics and overall strategy. In his role as USAF Deputy Chief of Staff for Development, Saville helped direct missile work, but soon replaced <b>himself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> GMIORG with Major General Robert M. Lee, commander of TAC. Saville was more interested in air-to-air guided missiles than in ground-based ballistic missiles, which became the focus of the committee.|$|E
5|$|Marshall {{was inaugurated}} as Governor of Indiana on January 11, 1909. Since his party {{had been out}} of power for many years, its initial {{objective}} was to appoint as many Democrats as possible to patronage positions. Marshall tried to avoid becoming directly involved in the patronage system. He allowed the party's different factions to have positions and appointed very few of his own choices. He allowed Taggart to manage the process and pick the candidates, but signed off <b>himself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> official appointments. Although his position on patronage kept peace in his party, it prevented him from building a strong political base.|$|E

On the July 20 episode of SmackDown, Edge was forced to vacate the World Heavyweight Championship {{as a result of}} his injury. The Great Khali went on to win a 20-man battle royal to become the new World Heavyweight Champion. At The Great American Bash, Khali defended the title successfully against Kane and Batista in a Triple Threat match.|$|E

McGinnis was subsequently killed in action when he deliberately threw <b>himself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grenade, saving the lives of at least four other soldiers in the vehicle.

5|$|Ruislip parish {{was owned}} by the Benedictine Bec Abbey of Normandy between 1096 and 1404 during which time the prior built a home for <b>himself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> site, {{surrounded}} by a moat. During the 16th century, {{the remains of the}} motte-and-bailey site were used as the gardens of the Manor Farm House when it was built. In 1888 the moat extension was filled in by Henry James Ewer, who farmed on the site. The moat's shape and the presence of traces of a fortified building have allowed this part of the site to be dated to the 11th century. However, the castle {{is believed to have been}} built around 1066 then either demolished or changed significantly as it does not appear as a castle in Domesday Book.|$|E

Explaining his theory that the emergence of various superhumans on Stephen's Earth {{is the result of the}} universe trying to save itself, the Watcher tells Strange that he will not be able to repeat what he has learned while he is alive.|$|E
