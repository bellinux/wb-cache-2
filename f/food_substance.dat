25|$|Food intolerances can be {{classified}} according to their mechanism. Intolerance can result from the absence of specific chemicals or enzymes needed to digest a <b>food</b> <b>substance,</b> as in hereditary fructose intolerance. It may {{be a result of}} an abnormality in the body's ability to absorb nutrients, as occurs in fructose malabsorption. Food intolerance reactions can occur to naturally occurring chemicals in foods, as in salicylate sensitivity. Drugs sourced from plants, such as aspirin, can also cause these kinds of reactions.|$|E
25|$|Honey is a sweet, viscous <b>food</b> <b>substance</b> {{produced}} by bees and some related insects. Bees produce honey from the sugary secretions of plants (floral nectar) or other insects (aphid honeydew) through regurgitation, enzymatic activity, and water evaporation, and store it in wax structures called honeycombs. The variety of honey {{produced by}} honey bees (the genus Apis) is the best-known, {{due to its}} worldwide commercial production and human consumption. Honey is collected from wild bee colonies, or from hives of domesticated bees, a practice known as beekeeping.|$|E
25|$|As {{a natural}} <b>food</b> <b>substance,</b> manna would produce waste products; but in {{classical}} rabbinical literature, as a supernatural substance, {{it was held}} that manna produced no waste, resulting in no defecation among the Israelites until several decades later, when the manna had ceased to fall. Modern medical science suggests the lack of defecation over such {{a long period of}} time would cause severe bowel problems, especially when other food later began to be consumed again. Classical rabbinical writers say that the Israelites complained about the lack of defecation, and were concerned about potential bowel problems.|$|E

Participants were asked to perform an emotion recognition task before and after eating either a piece of chocolate or a small amount of fish sauce – which we expected to induce happiness or disgust, respectively. Our results showed that being in a specific emotional state improves recognition of the corresponding emotional facial expression. Indeed, eating chocolate improved recognition of happy faces, while disgusted expressions were more readily recognized after eating fish sauce. In line with the embodied account of emotion understanding, we suggest that people are better at inferring the emotional state of others when their own emotional state resonates with the observed one...|$|R
