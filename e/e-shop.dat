This study reexamines the explanatory factors that are related to people’s <b>e-shopping</b> patterns through a study of the Columbus Metropolitan Area, OH. It focuses on the effect of accessibility to local shops and the residential context on the adoption of <b>e-shopping</b> and the frequency of buying online. Using an activity – Internet diary dataset, the results suggest that people with lower levels of accessibility to local shopping opportunities are {{more likely to engage in}} <b>e-shopping,</b> since the Internet enhances the efficiency of shopping by providing more product information and by eliminating the need of travel in the physical world.

40|$|Nowadays, the Internet {{permeates}} society: {{for many}} people, life without the Internet {{is hard to}} imagine. <b>E-shopping</b> (searching and/or buying products online) has rapidly gained popularity {{in the past few}} years, and could affect consumers’ visits to stores. The goal of this research is to show which consumers shop online and how this relates to their store visits. 	The findings show that people who frequently shop online do not visit stores less often. On the contrary; store visits seem to be stimulated by <b>e-shopping.</b> Additionally, <b>e-shopping</b> seems to be encouraged by visiting stores. For the present, it looks as if retailers need not worry about the closure of their stores through an increase in <b>e-shopping.</b> In the long term, however, this is not beyond the realms of possibility. 	Sociodemographics, Internet behaviour, and shopping attitudes are all associated with the adoption of <b>e-shopping.</b> Where you live and how many stores are close by are factors that also affect online shopping. 	<b>E-shopping</b> is unlikely to function as a means of reducing travel, although the results also show that <b>e-shopping</b> might substitute for shopping trips. Overall, more rather than less travel is likely to occur. More travel leads to more pollution, so policy makers have {{to be aware of the}} potential environmental effects of <b>e-shopping...</b>|$|R
40|$|Despite many {{previous}} empirical {{investigations in}} the area of <b>e-shopping,</b> it is not clear why the adoption of <b>e-shopping</b> in one country is faster than in another country. This study investigates the motivation of <b>e-shopping</b> between two different countries from a qualitative approach. In particular, this paper compares between consumer perception of <b>e-shopping</b> in the United Kingdom (UK), a developed country and Malaysia, a developing country. The study explores the differences of behavioural aspect between consumers in the UK and Malaysia in terms of motives and reasons in conducting <b>e-shopping.</b> Focus group discussions were conducted with consumers, who were residing in the UK and Malaysia; who have adopted <b>e-shopping</b> for at least a year. Focusing on the actual consumers’ shopping experience and not their shopping intention, this approach gives more advantage in identifying the actual motives and reasons of adopting <b>e-shopping.</b> The study found that most of the motives and reasons of adopting <b>e-shopping</b> are associated with some of the innovation attributes by Rogers (that is, relative advantages, complexity and compatibility). E-shoppers are price sensitive, while trust and strong brand name are influential to e-shoppers. The lack of the motives and reasons explained why the adoption of <b>e-shopping</b> is slower in Malaysia. The study confirms that the motives and reasons of adopting innovation are consistent with Rogers’ Diffusion Theory. The findings will help practitioners to recognise factors that drive consumers to buy online and facilitate business to develop successful e-marketing strategies...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to provide a better {{understanding}} of the relationships among quality, value, satisfaction, and loyalty when consumers choose to use technology-based retail formats such as online shopping. Three research objectives served to guide the development of an <b>e-shopping</b> loyalty model. The first objective was to investigate the extent to which the direct and indirect relationships among quality, value, satisfaction, and loyalty in technology-based retail environments parallel those that occur in traditional retail and service settings. The second research objective was to examine how the factors that predict quality-value perceptions for shopping online as compared to offline influence evaluations of <b>e-shopping</b> satisfaction and loyalty for an online merchant. The third objective was to investigate how a consumer's receptiveness to <b>e-shopping</b> technology influences evaluations of and loyalty to a merchant's website. There is a paucity of research regarding the interrelationships among these variables in technology-based consumption environments, therefore, the conceptual framework for the <b>e-shopping</b> model was drawn primarily from the relevant research in the retail and services literature. Data for the study was collected using a survey distributed by mail to the online apparel customers of a U. S. based company. The structural model employed to test the <b>e-shopping</b> loyalty model supported nine of the eleven hypothesized relationships. The links found in the causal model were reinterpreted as an Integrated Model of <b>e-Shopping</b> Loyalty. Findings suggest that online customer loyalty is less directly impacted by value-driven cognitions than by satisfactory shopping experiences. More specifically, perceptions of online shopping value impacted <b>e-shopping</b> loyalty only indirectly through the positive and direct effect of <b>e-shopping</b> satisfaction. Although cognitive assessments related to the merchandise offering played an important role in the evaluative process, shoppers' judgments of e-service quality were found to be more influential in affecting <b>e-shopping</b> loyalty. Additionally, shoppers appeared to be as concerned about the time and effort costs involved in online shopping as they were with the merchandise price. Finally, stronger feelings and beliefs about online shopping influenced consumers' evaluations of <b>e-shopping</b> primarily through their impact on perceptions of e-service quality...|$|R

Several categories were selected as qualitative units of analysis of communication between <b>e-shops</b> and fans, the frequencies of all the selected categories were measured and correlations between selected variables were calculated. Methodology/methods: The main research method was quantitative content analysis, which allows the gathering {{of large numbers of}} qualitative data and transforming them into data of quantitative nature that can then be the subject of further statistical analysis. In case of interesting quantitative findings, a qualitative explanation was used. Both communication from <b>e-shops</b> to fans and communication from fans to <b>e-shops</b> (and among fans) in the years 2011 - 2013 were analyzed. Scientific aim: The objective of the research presented in {{this article is based on}} content analysis to evaluate the level of the Facebook communication of selected Czech <b>e-shops</b> with consumer electronics within 2011 - 2013 using a quantitative content analysis method. Findings: The results show that the posting frequency of all the analysed <b>e-shops</b> is rather low, between 4 - 6 days. The <b>e-shops</b> vary in the most frequent types of posts. Posts that elicited the highest numbers of reactions were characteristic with their viral nature. A strong, statistically significant correlation between the number of fans of the fan page and the frequency of their reactions to the posts was found. Conclusions: All of the analysed <b>e-shops</b> should increase the frequency of contact with their fans through more frequent posting and modification in the content of the posts.

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of {{e-commerce}} is imposing profound impacts on modern society. On the supply side, the emergence of e-commerce is greatly changing the operation behavior of some retailers and is increasing product internationalization due to its geographically unlimited nature. On the demand side, the pervasiveness of e-commerce affects how, where, and when consumers shop, and indirectly influences {{the way in which}} we live our lives. However, the development of e-commerce is still in an early stage, and why consumers choose (or do not choose) online purchasing is far from being completely understood. To better evaluate and anticipate those profound impacts of e-commerce, therefore, it is important to further refine our understanding of consumers' <b>e-shopping</b> behavior. A number of studies have investigated <b>e-shopping</b> behavior, and reviewing them is valuable for further improving our understanding. This report aims to summarize previous <b>e-shopping</b> research in a systematic way. In this review, we are interested primarily in the potential benefits and costs that the internet offers for the business-to-consumer segment of e-commerce in the transaction (purchase) channel. An overview of the 65 empirical studies analyzed in this report is provided in the Appendix. Most previous studies fall into one or more of several theoretical frameworks, including the theory of reasoned action, the theory of planned behavior, the technology acceptance model, transaction cost theory, innovation diffusion theory, and others. Among them, social psychological theories (the theory of reasoned action, the theory of planned behavior, the technology acceptance model) were widely applied. As shown in the applications of different theories, <b>e-shopping</b> behavior is not a simple decision process, and thus an integration of various theories is necessary to deal with its complexities. We suggest synthesizing these theories through the development of a comprehensive list of benefits and costs, using each of the key constructs of the pertinent theories as a guide to identifying the nature of those benefits and costs. The dependent variables mainly include <b>e-shopping</b> intention and actual <b>e-shopping</b> behavior (a few studies used attitudes toward <b>e-shopping).</b> <b>E-shopping</b> intention was measured by various dimensions. Among them, the directly-stated intention to purchase online is the most frequently used measure. Although some studies used a unidimensional measure, most adopted a latent construct to assess consumers' <b>e-shopping</b> intentions. Actual <b>e-shopping</b> behavior mainly includes three dimensions: adoption, spending, and frequency. Most studies examined one or more of these three dimensions directly, while a few studies constructed a latent variable to measure actual <b>e-shopping</b> behavior. When both behavioral intention and actual behavior are included in model development, attention should be paid to the time precedence between intention and behavior. With respect to sampling, a choice-based sampling approach is probably preferable given that online shopping activity accounts for a minor proportion of all consumers, and a far smaller proportion of total retail sales. In previous studies, most chose internet/computer/email users or students as their subjects. Generally, a student sample is a natural choice for some particular products such as books. However, parameter estimates developed from a student sample lack generalizability to a larger population because of its homogeneity. By contrast, a more general sample of internet/computer/email users is more applicable for <b>e-shopping</b> behavior research. The suitability of the internet as a shopping medium depends to a large extent on the characteristics of the products. Mixing product categories in <b>e-shopping</b> behavior research tends to yield vague or inconsistent results. It is therefore necessary to explicitly consider product characteristics when exploring consumers' <b>e-shopping</b> behavior. However, relatively little effort has been invested into product classification in the context of <b>e-shopping.</b> Although Nelson's dichotomized system (search and experience goods) and Peterson et al. 's three-dimensional system (cost, tangibility, and differentiability) provide useful guides for product type classification, each has some shortcomings. Therefore, more research should focus on the construction of product classification systems. Different methodologies have been applied in previous research. Generally, descriptive analysis is used to describe consumers' <b>e-shopping</b> behavior; correlational analysis goes beyond descriptive analysis and attempts to analyze how two variables are related; and multivariate analysis is mainly used to explain consumers' behavior using many variables considered together. Therefore, although descriptive and correlational analyses are important steps in helping to construct multivariate analyses, multivariate studies provide more information than these other two types of analyses. Multivariate analysis is ideal to study <b>e-shopping</b> behavior in depth. Among multivariate analysis techniques, multiple regression, structural equations modeling, and discrete choice models were most frequently used. Previous studies have identified various determinants of consumers' <b>e-shopping</b> behavior. These determinants mainly cover three essential elements: characteristics of <b>e-shopping</b> as a shopping channel, consumer characteristics, and vendor and product characteristics. Among these characteristics, the former two have been examined extensively in previous research, confirming their importance in understanding <b>e-shopping</b> behavior. Specifically, the dimensions of channel characteristics of <b>e-shopping</b> include <b>e-shopping</b> service quality, relative advantages, perceived risk of and confidence in <b>e-shopping,</b> and trust. Consumer characteristics include their shopping orientations, personality, social and psychological characteristics, computer/internet experience, in-home shopping experience, and socio-demographics.

The main objective of this paper is to examine intention of the factors affecting electronic shopping (<b>e-shopping)</b> using the approach of expanded TAM. In this paper, in order to develop the TAM, security, consistency and normative beliefs have been used as extra aspects that have significant impact on the acceptance of <b>e-shopping.</b> In this survey based study, 280 student of the University of Isfahan have been selected using random stratified sampling method. Respondents have been asked to fill questionnaires of TAM developed by Teylor and Todd (1995), compatibility and normative beliefs developed by Vijayasarathy (2004) and security developed by Salisbury (2001). Findings indicate that security, ease of use, consistency and usefulness are significant predictors of attitudes toward intention to <b>e-shopping</b> and normative beliefs has a positive effect on intention to <b>e-shopping.</b> Therefore, based on the determined factors influencing <b>e-shopping,</b> such factors can be improved towards encouraging users to do more <b>e-shopping...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{growing number}} of Internet users and the {{increasing}} volume of online sales gives rise to speculation about how <b>e-shopping</b> will affect shopping centres as we know them.

To test this proposition, we examined how perceived attractiveness of city centres influences the relation between city centre shopping and <b>e-shopping</b> for 3, 200 Internet users in the Netherlands. Results showed that more than 20 per cent of the online buyers made fewer trips to the city centre and also made fewer purchases at city centre stores, due to <b>e-shopping.</b> However, the higher the perceived attractiveness of the city centre, both in terms of range and convenience of shopping and accessibility, the less Internet users are inclined to shop online and to replace city centre shopping with <b>e-shopping.</b> Copyright (c) 2007 by the Royal Dutch Geographical Society KNAG. ...|$|R
