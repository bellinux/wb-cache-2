5|$|In March 2015, Raj Television Network {{announced}} that they would release a digital 5.1 surround sound version of the film in collaboration with Sai Ganesh Films, on an unspecified date in April, though it was eventually released on 21 August 2015. Murali B. V., coordinator of Sai Ganesh Films, which helped in the restoration and <b>digitisation</b> of the film's original prints, told The New Indian Express that it took nine months to clean the film prints and completely restore them for <b>digitisation</b> from the original 35 mm film prints with mono sound. The digitised version collected 553,000 in its opening weekend from 39 shows in Chennai, and emerged a commercial success.|$|E
5|$|Two {{open-source}} designs {{based on}} Bembo are Cardo and ET Book. The Cardo fonts, developed by David J. Perry {{for use in}} classical scholarship and also including Greek and Hebrew, are freely available under the SIL Open Font License. Unimpressed by the first Bembo <b>digitisation,</b> statistician and designer Edward Tufte commissioned an alternative <b>digitisation</b> for his books in a limited range of styles and languages, sometimes called 'ET Bembo'. He released it publicly as an open-source font named 'ET Book' in September 2015.|$|E
5|$|Several digitisations {{have been}} made of both ATF's {{original}} Garamond and the Linotype adaptation, most notably a 2015 <b>digitisation</b> by van Bronkhorst with optical sizes and the original swash characters. A loose adaptation with sans-serif companion by Christian Schwartz is the corporate font of Deutsche Bahn.|$|E

5|$|While Bembo Book is {{considered}} the superior <b>digitisation,</b> the original continues to offer the advantages of two extra weights (semi- and extra-bold) and infant styles with simplified a and g characters resembling handwriting; its lighter appearance may also be of use on printing equipment with greater ink spread. Cross-licensing has meant that it is sold by a range of vendors, often at very low prices. As an example of this, Fontsite obtained the rights to resell a derivative of the original <b>digitisation,</b> using the alternative name Borgia and Bergamo, upgrading it by additional OpenType features such as small capitals and historical alternative characters. Neither version includes digitisations of the larger size versions of Bembo, which had a more delicate and elegant design.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} and growing {{proportion of the}} collection is now made available to readers as surrogate facsimiles, either on microfilm, or, more recently, in digitised form. In 2010 a ten-year programme of <b>digitisation</b> of the newspaper archives with commercial partner DC Thomson subsidiary Brightsolid began, and the British Newspaper Archive was launched in November 2011. A dedicated newspaper reading room opened at St Pancras in April 2014, including facilities for consulting microfilmed and digital materials, and, where no surrogate exists, hard-copy material retrieved from Boston Spa.|$|E
5|$|As of 2017, Monotype's current <b>digitisation</b> of Gill Sans is Gill Sans Nova, by George Ryan. Gill Sans Nova adds many {{additional}} variants, {{including some}} of the previously undigitised inline versions, stylistic alternates and an ultra-light weight (once an option in metal type) which had been digitised for Grazia. The fonts differ from Gill Sans MT in their adoption of the hooked 1 as default, while the regular weight is renamed 'Medium'. Monotype celebrated the release with a London exhibition on Gill's work, as they had in 1958 to mark the general release of Gill's serif design Joanna. One addition was italic swash caps, which had been considered by Gill but never released.|$|E

5|$|Monotype's 1922-3 design, {{based on}} Jannon's {{work in the}} Imprimerie Nationale, is bundled with many Microsoft products. Its italic, {{faithful}} to Jannon's, is extremely calligraphic, with a very variable angle of slant and flourishes on several lower-case letters. Its commercial release is more extensive than the basic Microsoft release, featuring additional features such as swash capitals and small capitals, although like many pre-digital fonts these are only included in the regular weight. Popular in the metal type era, its <b>digitisation</b> has been criticised for having too light a colour on the page for body text if printed with many common printing systems, a problem with several Monotype digitisations of the period. Monotype's 1933 guide to identifying their typefaces noted the asymmetrical T, the sharp triangular serif at top left of m, n, p and r, and a q unlike the p, with a point at top right rather than a full serif.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike earlier <b>digitisations,</b> Schwartz created two {{different}} optical sizes for body text and display sizes, which have different spacing metrics giving tighter spacing at display size and looser spacing to increase legibility in body text. The release includes {{a number of}} features not present on <b>digitisations</b> branded as Helvetica, including corrected-curve obliques, tabular figures and stylistic alternates such as separate punctuation sets for upper- and lower-case text.|$|R
25|$|By {{contrast}} to Europe, the flexible nature of US copyright law, {{and in particular}} fair use means that content mining in America, {{as well as other}} fair use countries such as Israel, Taiwan and South Korea is viewed as being legal. As content mining is transformative, that is it does not supplant the original work, it is viewed as being lawful under fair use. For example, as part of the Google Book settlement the presiding judge on the case ruled that Google's <b>digitisation</b> project of in-copyright books was lawful, {{in part because of the}} transformative uses that the <b>digitisation</b> project displayed - one being text and data mining.|$|E

50|$|Some {{releases}} of Palatino have had swash capitals in italic. These {{have not been}} found in <b>digitisations,</b> although <b>digitisations</b> of Zapf's Renaissance Antiqua design (discussed below) do include a different set. In addition, later versions alter the descenders on many letters; Zapf had originally kept these short to allow Palatino to fit on the German common line standard, optimised for blackletter typefaces but later versions escape this restriction.|$|R

This family include fonts in regular and bold weights, with fractions, ligatures, small caps (regular and regular italic only), swashes (regular italic weight only), and Central European characters. An notable feature is that like some hot metal releases of Caslon, two separate options for descenders are provided for all styles: long descenders (creating a more elegant designs) or short (allowing tighter linespacing).|$|E

50|$|Some fonts, {{especially}} <b>digitisations</b> {{of older}} metal type designs, often lack small caps in bold or italics. This {{is because they}} were normally only used in body text and cutting bold and italic small caps was thought unnecessary.|$|R
25|$|The Abbey {{library of}} Saint Gall is {{recognized}} as one of the richest medieval libraries in the world. It is home to one of the most comprehensive collections of early medieval books in the German-speaking part of Europe. , the library consists of over 160,000 books, of which 2100 are handwritten. Nearly half of the handwritten books are from the Middle Ages and 400 are over 1000 years old. Lately the Stiftsbibliothek has launched a project for the <b>digitisation</b> of the priceless manuscript collection, which currently (December 2009) contains 355 documents that are available on the Codices Electronici Sangallenses webpage.|$|E
25|$|Launched in 2003 under Nanakshahi Trust, the Punjab Digital Library was {{a result}} of the early phase of the digital {{revolution}} in Punjab. While most saw the Nanakshahi as a small <b>digitisation</b> organisation, or as an assemblage of some unknown youth working towards capturing some manuscripts on their digital cameras, its founders saw it as a cornerstone of a fundamentally new approach to preserving Punjab's heritage for future generations. In the shadow of search engines, a Semantic Web approach conceived in the early 2003 reached maturity in 2006. This was when the organisation planned to expand its operations from a mere three-employee organisation to one of the leading NGOs working in the field of digital preservation all over India.|$|E
