30|$|Modern {{agriculture}} {{production is}} a very energy-intensive industry. Fuel and fertilizers (N and P) account for the largest share (> 75 %) of all energy expenditures in a mixed cropping system (Hetz [1992]; Safa and Tabatabaeefar [2002]; Ahmad [1994]). In the past 50 years, crop yields have substantially increased, mainly resulting {{from the use of}} chemical fertilizers and pesticides, the development of new crop varieties, and the <b>improvement</b> <b>in</b> <b>cultivation</b> methods (Xie et al. [2011]). However, excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides raised pest resistance toward pesticides and increased the production costs (Paul et al. [2002]; Tilman et al. [2002]). What is more, their excessive use and misuse, their volatility, and long-distance transports eventually result in widespread environmental contamination (Kaushik et al. [2009]). In particular, many older, non-patented, more toxic, environmentally persistent, and inexpensive chemicals were extensively used in developing nations, creating serious acute health problems and local and global environmental impacts (Ecobichon [2001]). One way to optimize energy consumption in agriculture is to determine the efficiency of methods and techniques used (Bockari-Gevao et al. [2005]). Thus, improving the farmer's rice production model to reduce the agro-chemical application rate is of great importance to decrease pollution and guarantee the security of food quality.|$|E
40|$|The {{timing of}} flowering, and in {{particular}} the degree to which it is responsive to the environment, is a key factor in the adaptation of a given species to various eco-geographic locations and agricultural practices. Flowering time variation has been documented in many crop legumes, and selection for specific variants has permitted significant expansion and <b>improvement</b> <b>in</b> <b>cultivation,</b> from prehistoric times to the present day. Recent advances in legume genomics have accelerated the process of gene identification and functional analysis, and opened up new prospects for a molecular understanding of flowering time adaptation in this important crop group. Within the legumes, two species have been prominent in flowering time studies; the vernalization-responsive long-day species pea (Pisum sativum) and the warm-season short-day plant soybean (Glycine max). Analysis of flowering in these species is now being complemented by reverse genetics capabilities in the model legumes Medicago truncatula and Lotus japonicus, and the emergence of genome-scale resources in a range of other legumes. This review will outline the insights gained from detailed forward genetic analysis of flowering time in pea and soybean, highlighting the importance of light perception, the circadian clock and the FT family of flowering integrators. It discusses the current state of knowledge on genetic mechanisms for photoperiod and vernalization response, and concludes with a broader discussion of flowering time adaptation across legumes generally...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{dominant}} bacterial {{groups in the}} plant rhizosphere, e. g., those belonging to the phyla Acidobacteria and Verrucomicrobia, has, so far, not been elucidated, and this is mainly {{due to the lack}} of culturable representatives. This study aimed to isolate hitherto-uncultured bacteria from the potato rhizosphere by a combination of cultivation approaches. An agar medium low in carbon availability (oligotrophic agar medium) and either amended with potato root exudates or catalase or left unamended was used with the aim to improve the culturability of bacteria from the potato rhizosphere. The colony forming unit numbers based on colonies and microcolonies were compared with microscopically determined fluorescence-stained cell numbers. Taxonomical diversity of the colonies was compared with that of library clones made from rhizosphere DNA, on the basis of 16 S rRNA gene comparisons. The oligotrophic media amended or not with catalase or rhizosphere extract recovered up to 33. 6 % of the total bacterial numbers, at least seven times more than the recovery observed on R 2 A. Four hitherto-uncultured Verrucomicrobia subdivision 1 representatives were recovered on agar, but representatives of this group were not found in the clone library. The use of oligotrophic medium and its modifications enabled the growth of colony numbers, exceeding those on classical agar media. Also, it led to the isolation of hitherto-uncultured bacteria from the potato rhizosphere. Further <b>improvement</b> <b>in</b> <b>cultivation</b> will certainly result in the recovery of other as-yet-unexplored bacteria from the rhizosphere, making these groups accessible for further investigation, e. g., with respect to their possible interactions with plants.

50|$|Despite its {{military}} weakness, the Song dynasty {{is widely considered}} to be the high point of classical Chinese civilization. The Song economy, facilitated by technology advancement, had reached a level of sophistication probably unseen in world history before its time. The population soared to over 100 million and the living standards of common people improved tremendously due to <b>improvements</b> <b>in</b> rice <b>cultivation</b> and the wide availability of coal for production. The capital cities of Kaifeng and subsequently Hangzhou were both the most populous cities in the world for their time, and encouraged vibrant civil societies unmatched by previous Chinese dynasties. As land trading routes to far west were blocked by nomadic empires, there were extensive maritime trade with neighbouring states, which facilitated the use of Song coinage as the de facto currency of exchange. Giant wooden vessels equipped with compasses travelled throughout the China Seas and northern Indian Ocean. The concept of insurance was practised by merchants to hedge the risks of such long-haul maritime shipments. With prosperous economic activities, the historically first use of paper currency emerged in the western city of Chengdu, as a supplement to the existing copper coins.|$|R

Fermentation conditions such as concentration of initial glucose in the culture, concentration of lactic acid accumulated in the culture, types of pH control strategy, types of aeration mode and different agitation speed had influenced the cultivation performance of batch fermentation of Pediococcus acidilactici. The maximum viable cell concentration obtained in constant fed-batch fermentation at a feeding rate of 0.015 Â L/h was 6.1 times higher with 1.6 times reduction in lactic acid accumulation compared to batch fermentation. Anion exchange resin, IRA 67 {{was found to have}} the highest selectivity towards lactic acid compared to other components studied. Fed-batch fermentation of P. acidilactici coupled with lactic acid removal system using IRA 67 resin showed 55.5 and 9.1 times of <b>improvement</b> <b>in</b> maximum viable cell concentration compared to fermentation without resin for batch and fed-batch mode respectively. The improvement of the P. acidilactici growth in the constant fed-batch fermentation indicated the use of minimal and simple process control equipment is an effective approach for reducing by-product inhibition. Further <b>improvement</b> <b>in</b> the <b>cultivation</b> performance of P. acidilactici in fed-bath fermentation with in situ addition of anion-exchange resin significantly helped to enhance the growth of P. acidilactici by reducing the inhibitory effect of lactic acid and thus increasing probiotic production.|$|R
40|$|The {{maintenance}} of the differentiated hepatocyte phenotype and its specific physiological properties is known to depend on several factors, such as chemical signals, cell-cell and extracellular matrix molecular interactions, {{as well as the}} use of three-dimensional matrices. The entrapment of hepatocytes within Ca-alginate at high cell density and the culture under continuous flow favour the development of three-dimensional organization and promote expression of the differentiated hepatic phenotype. This system could represent an <b>improvement</b> <b>in</b> hepatocyte <b>cultivation</b> for basic studies of liver physiology and metabolism; it could also be applicable in toxicology, hepatocyte transplantation or development of bioartificial organs. This report describes the effect of alginate entrapment and culture in a bioreactor on hepatocyte aggregate formation, with particular attention to the reestablishment of cell polarity, cell junctions and three-dimensional re-organization of the cytoskeleton. Oxygen supply and cell oxygen consumption rate were monitored in order to evaluate possible changes in hepatocyte energy requirement. Our data show that after only 6 h of perfusion in the bioreactor, actin and cytokeratin localize along the adhesion areas of the plasma membrane, in which reconstituted bile canaliculi were also observed. Moreover, the presence of connexin at the level of joined membranes of neighbouring cells suggests the establishment of gap junctions between hepatocytes.

40|$|Large changes {{introduced}} in the sugar beet production technology in the Vojvodina Province over last 40 years resulted in changes in the etiology and harmfulness of different agents of sugar beet root diseases. <b>Improvements</b> <b>in</b> <b>cultivation</b> practices reduced the harmfulness of some diseases while increased the harmfulness of others. Some disease agents became obsolete, but others gained importance. New agents of root diseases were found. The most frequent damages, persisting {{over long periods of}} time were caused by seedling damping-off, Fusarium root rot, charcoal root rot, parasitic (Rhizomania) and non-parasitic root bearding. The parasitic damping-off caused by several fungal species but most frequently by Phoma betae occurred at the time when multigerm seeds were used in combination with extensive cultural practices. The agents of seedling diseases completely lost their significance as the consequence of switching to fungicide - treated monogerm seeds, earlier planting and improved soil tillage. In the period of intensive use of agricultural chemicals, seedling damping-off occurred frequently due to the phytotoxic action of chemicals (insecticides, herbicides and mineral fertilizers). In some years, frosts caused damping- off of sugar beet seedlings on a large scale in the Vojvodina Province. Poor sugar beet germination and emergence were frequently due to spring droughts. Sometimes they were due to strong winds. The occurrence of Fusarium root rot and charcoal root rot intensified on poor soils. Fusariosis symptoms were exhibited as plant wilting and different forms of root rot. In recent years root tip rot has occurred frequently in the first part of the growing season causing necrosis and dying of plants. Lateral roots tended to proliferate from the healthy tissue, giving the root a bearded appearance similar to Rhizomania. Fusarium oxysporum was the most frequent agent of this fusariosis. F. graminearum, F. equiseti, F. solani have also been identified in recent years as the agent of root rot, but its importance was much lower. Charcoal root rot and plant wilting (Macrophomina phaseolina) have caused extensive damages in sugar beets, especially under the conditions of severe drought and high temperatures in summer. In some years, it was the dominant agent of root rot. Mixed infections caused by fungi from the genera Fusarium and M. phaseolina were encountered frequently. The extent of damage caused by these diseases was reduced by improved pro- duction technology. Rhizomania of sugar beet (caused by beet necrotic yellow vein virus) was identified in Serbia in the 1970 s. Results of recent investigations have shown that BNYVV is widespread in Vojvodina, since the virus was found on 36, 7 % (24, 674 ha) of acreages from 67, 213 ha of total sugar beet acreages inspected on incidence of BNYVV in the period from 1997 to 2004 year.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of using photosynthetic microorganisms, such as cyanobacteria and microalgae, for converting light {{and carbon dioxide}} into valuable biochemical products has raised {{the need for new}} cost-efficient processes ensuring a constant product quality. Food, feed, biofuels, cosmetics and pharmaceutics are among the sectors that can profit from the application of photosynthetic microorganisms. Biomass growth in a photobioreactor is a complex process influenced by multiple parameters, such as photosynthetic light capture and attenuation, nutrient uptake, photobioreactor hydrodynamics and gas-liquid mass transfer. In order to optimize productivity while keeping a standard product quality, a permanent control of the main cultivation parameters is necessary, where the continuous cultivation has shown to be the best option. However it is of utmost importance to recognize the singularity of continuous cultivation of cyanobacteria and microalgae due to their dependence on light availability and intensity. In this sense, this review provides comprehensive information on recent breakthroughs and possible future trends regarding technological and process <b>improvements</b> <b>in</b> continuous <b>cultivation</b> systems of microalgae and cyanobacteria, that will directly affect cost-effectiveness and product quality standardization.
