50|$|The NR-413 is a Belgian {{trip wire}} {{activated}} anti-personnel stake mine. The {{main body of}} the mine is wine bottle shaped, with an NR 410 tripwire fuse screwed into a <b>fuse</b> <b>well</b> {{on the top of the}} mine. Under the <b>fuse</b> <b>well</b> is a detonator and a row of booster pellets. Wrapped around the detonator and booster pellets is the main charge. An internally square cross-sectioned steel wire is coiled around the outside of the mine, which give a fragmentation effect. The mine produces 600 fragments with a velocity of approximately 1,660 metres per second. It has an effective range of around 15 metres. A variant is produced with a cast steel fragmentation jacket.|$|E

50|$|The P2 Mk2 and P3 Mk2 are Pakistani plastic cased minimum metal {{anti-tank}} blast mines. The P2 Mk2 has {{a square}} {{case with a}} central circular ribbed pressure plate, the P3 is circular with a central circular pressure plate. Both mines use anti-personnel mines as the fuse, typically the either the P4 Mk1 or P2 Mk2 anti-personnel mines. The anti-personnel mine sits in a cavity below the pressure plate, when enough pressure is place on the pressure plate of the mine, it collapses onto the anti-personnel mine triggering it and the main charge which sits below it. A yellow canvas carrying strap is normally fitted {{to the side of}} the mine. The mines have a secondary <b>fuse</b> <b>well</b> on the bottom which can be used with anti-handling devices. A GLM-2 electronic booby trap can be fitted to the cavity under the pressure plate. The mine is supplied with a steel disc which makes the mine more easily detectable, although this is seldom used. Since 1997 only a detectable version of the mine has been produced, and to comply with the Convention on Conventional Weapons amended protocol II, Pakistani stocks of the mine are being retrofitted with steel detection discs. The mines are found in Afghanistan, Angola, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Pakistan, Somalia, and Tajikistan.|$|E

40|$|Dialect {{recognition}} is a challenging and multifaceted problem. Distinguishing between dialects can rely upon many tiers of interpretation of speech dataâ€”e. g., prosodic, phonetic, spectral, and word. High-accuracy automatic methods for dialect recognition typically rely upon either phonetic or spectral {{characteristics of the}} input. A challenge with spectral system, such as those based on shifted-delta cepstral coefficients, is that they achieve good performance but do not provide insight into distinctive dialect features. In this work, a novel method based upon discriminative training and phone N-grams is proposed. This approach achieves excellent classification performance, <b>fuses</b> <b>well</b> with other systems, and has interpretable dialect characteristics in the phonetic tier.

40|$|LNTs {{are unique}} 3 D {{structures}} made only of safe and abundant biomaterials by self-assembly. The current bottleneck for developing applications using LNTs {{is the lack}} of an easy technique to pattern them on substrates. We report a method to free-draw single lipid nanotube (LNT) patterns in any shape on surfaces with 1, 2 -dioleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) that takes an inverted hexagonal (HII) phase. We used pre-self-assembled LNTs or HII lipid blocks as a lipid reservoir from which new LNTs were pulled by applying a point load with a micromanipulator. The extreme simplicity of our technique originates from the fundamental nature of DOPE lipids that prefer a HII phase, while all the conventional approaches use PC lipids that form a lamellar phase. By adjusting the surface properties with polyelectrolyte multilayers, the created single LNT objects are able to remain adhered to the surface for over a week. Importantly, it could be shown that two vesicles loaded with caged fluorescent molecules were able to <b>fuse</b> <b>well</b> with a LNT, enabling diffusive transport of uncaged fluorescent molecules from one vesicle to the other...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The processing characteristics of PVC compounds {{play a major role}} on the ability of the equipment to control the final properties of the product. Therefore, information on the effect of processing conditions on such characteristics. and its influence on the final properties can lead to an optimization of the extrusion process. In this work. a statistically based experimental design was used in order to investigate the role of the operating conditions on the extrusion of a simple lead based PVC formulation. Both a single and a twin screw extruder were used - they were instrumented, and data collected by computer. A die was designed for the formulation used. with both shear and extensional flows being taken into account. These experiments produced both core samples along the screw(s) and final products with varying states of fusion. The fusion mechanism on processing was monitored with the help of electron and light microscopy techniques. thermal analysis and density measurements. In both types of extruders the primary particles were found to <b>fuse</b> <b>well</b> before the grains, but the overall mechanism differs for each type of machine. An experimental technique was developed {{for the study of the}} Residence Time (RT) and Residence Time Distribution (RTD) of the material in the processing equipment. These functions were related to the operating conditions and compared with the available models for extrusion. The degree of fusion of the processed products was assessed by rheology and thermal analysis. A range of mechanical properties, relevant to the general end - use of rigid PVC formulations. was analysed: flexural. tensile and impact properties were found to be directly related with fusion level. Hardness, measured using a newly developed apparatus. proved to be a potential technique for the degree of gelation of PVC formulations...|$|E
40|$|Like humans, {{birds that}} exhibit vocal {{learning}} have relatively delayed telencephalon maturation, {{resulting in a}} disproportionately smaller brain prenatally but enlarged telencephalon in adulthood relative to vocal non-learning birds. To determine if this size difference results from evolutionary changes in cell-autonomous or cell-interdependent developmental processes, we transplanted telencephala from zebra finch donors (a vocal-learning species) into Japanese quail hosts (a vocal non-learning species) during the early neural tube stage (day 2 of incubation), and harvested the chimeras at later embryonic stages (between 9 â€“ 12 days of incubation). The donor and host tissues <b>fused</b> <b>well</b> with each other, with known major fiber pathways connecting the zebra finch and quail parts of the brain. However, the overall sizes of chimeric finch telencephala were larger than non-transplanted finch telencephala at the same developmental stages, even though the proportional sizes of telencephalic subregions and fiber tracts were similar to normal finches. There were no {{significant changes in the}} size of chimeric quail host midbrains, even though they were innervated by the physically smaller zebra finch brain, including the smaller retinae of the finch eyes. Chimeric zebra finch telencephala had a decreased cell density relative to normal finches. However, cell nucleus size differences between each species were maintained as in normal birds. These results suggest that telencephalic size development is partially cell-interdependent, and that th...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{examine the}} {{application}} of bioabsorbable screws for anterior cervical decompression and bone grafting fixation and to study their clinical effects {{in the treatment of}} cervical spondylosis. METHODS: From March 2007 to September 2012, 56 patients, 36 males and 20 females (38 - 79 years old, average 58. 3 Â± 9. 47 years), underwent a novel operation. Grafts were fixed by bioabsorbable screws (PLLA, 2. 7 mm in diameter) after anterior decompression. The bioabsorbable screws were inserted from the midline of the graft bone to the bone surface of the upper and lower vertebrae at 45 degree angles. Patients were evaluated post-operatively to observe the improvement of symptoms and evaluate the fusion of the bone. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score was used to evaluate the recovery of neurological functions. RESULTS: All screws were successfully inserted, with no broken screws. The rate of symptom improvement was 87. 5 %. All of the grafts <b>fused</b> <b>well</b> with no extrusion. The average time for graft fusion was 3. 8 Â± 0. 55 months (range 3 - 5 months). Three-dimensional reconstruction of CT scans demonstrated that the grafts fused with adjacent vertebrae well and that the screws were absorbed as predicted. The MRI findings showed that the cerebrospinal fluid was unobstructed. No obvious complications appeared in any of the follow-up evaluations. CONCLUSIONS: Cervical spondylosis with one- or two-level involvement can be effectively treated by anterior decompression and bone grafting with bioabsorbable screw fixation. This operative method is safe and can avoid the complications induced by metal implants...|$|R
