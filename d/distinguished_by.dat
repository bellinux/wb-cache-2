5|$|As {{each region}} {{has its own}} {{traditional}} pattern, batiks are commonly <b>distinguished</b> <b>by</b> the region they originated in, such as batik Solo, batik Pekalongan, and batik Madura. Batiks from Java can be <b>distinguished</b> <b>by</b> their general pattern and colours into batik pedalaman (inland batik) or batik pesisir (coastal batik). Batiks which do not fall neatly {{into one of these}} two categories are only referred to by their region. A mapping of batik designs from all places in Indonesia depicts the similarities and reflects cultural assimilation within batik designs.|$|E

5|$|Inocybe maculata {{is similar}} to the {{variable}} Inocybe lacera, the split fibrecap, but it can be differentiated by the darker colouration of the cap, and the white remains of the veil in the centre of the cap. The species is also similar in appearance to Inocybe lanatodisca, but can be readily <b>distinguished</b> <b>by</b> odour (I.lanatodisca has a characteristic sweet, green-corn smell) and the colour of the cap (I.lanatodisca has a fulvous cap). It is closely related to Inocybe fastigiata, but can again be <b>distinguished</b> <b>by</b> colour; I.fastigiata has lighter coloured fibrils.|$|E

5|$|The related Banksia caleyi {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} but can be <b>distinguished</b> <b>by</b> its recurved (downward curving) leaf margins, and smaller follicles and perianths. Its flowers appear from October to December.|$|E
5|$|The species Pholiota squarrosoides has {{a similar}} outward appearance, {{but it may be}} <b>distinguished</b> <b>by</b> its brown spores and sticky cap surface {{underneath}} the scales. In the hedgehog pholiota (Phaeomarasmius erinaceellus), the overall size is smaller—cap diameter —and the spores are cinnamon-brown. Some species in the genus Cystoderma also appear similar, but can be <b>distinguished</b> <b>by</b> microscopic features, like the presence of spherical (rather than club-shaped) cells in the cuticle of the cap, and also their habitat—Cystoderma usually grows on soil, rather than wood.|$|E

50|$|Scarlet badis {{are among}} the {{smallest}} percoid fish species. Males usually do not exceed 2 cm, with the females being even smaller around 1.3 cm. Apart from the size difference, the sexes are easy to <b>distinguish</b> <b>by</b> the vibrant colors and prominent fins of the male.|$|R
5|$|The {{subspecies}} of {{this bird}} {{can usually be}} <b>distinguished</b> <b>by</b> their difference in size and plumage. The subspecies Phaethon aethereus mesonauta can be differentiated by its slightly rosy tinge when its plumage is fresh, the bolder look of the black barring on the upperwing, and the more solid look of the black on the outer wing. The subspecies P. a. indicus can be <b>distinguished</b> <b>by</b> its smaller size, its smaller mask on the face, which often does not extend far behind the eye, and its more orange bill with black cutting edge.|$|E

5|$|Thelephora anthocephala is {{somewhat}} similar in appearance, {{but can be}} <b>distinguished</b> <b>by</b> branches that taper upward, branch tips that are flattened (instead of spoon-like), {{and the lack of}} a fetid odor. The North American species T.vialis has smaller spores and a more variable color.

5|$|Although the {{relatively}} large fruiting bodies of R.pulcherrimus are distinctive, {{they might be}} confused with superficially similar species, such as Rubroboletus eastwoodiae; the latter species has a much thicker stalk. Another similar species is R.haematinus, which may be <b>distinguished</b> <b>by</b> its yellower stem and cap colors that are various shades of brown. Its darker cap and lack of reticulation on the stipe differentiate it from R. satanas.|$|E

5|$|Around 120,000 {{species of}} fungi have been {{described}} by taxonomists, but the global biodiversity of the fungus kingdom is not fully understood. A 2017 estimate suggests there may be between 2.2 and 3.8 million species. In mycology, species have historically been <b>distinguished</b> <b>by</b> {{a variety of methods}} and concepts. Classification based on morphological characteristics, such as {{the size and shape of}} spores or fruiting structures, has traditionally dominated fungal taxonomy. Species may also be <b>distinguished</b> <b>by</b> their biochemical and physiological characteristics, such as their ability to metabolize certain biochemicals, or their reaction to chemical tests. The biological species concept discriminates species based on their ability to mate. The application of molecular tools, such as DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, to study diversity has greatly enhanced the resolution and added robustness to estimates of genetic diversity within various taxonomic groups.|$|E
