5|$|Prior to the cup final, Napoli were {{in third}} place in Serie A and {{therefore}} in the last position {{to qualify for the}} Champions League, eight points ahead of Fiorentina with nine points left to play for. Fiorentina manager Vincenzo Montella said before the game that his priority was to finish fourth and win the Coppa Italia. His Napoli counterpart, Rafael Benítez, warned his players not to <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> solely based on their league position.|$|E

25|$|Wallace did not <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the {{election}} – his {{strategy was to}} prevent either major party candidate from winning a preliminary majority in the Electoral College. He had his electors pledge to vote not necessarily for him but rather for whomever he directed them to support – his objective was not to move {{the election}} into the U.S. House of Representatives, but rather to give himself the bargaining power to determine the winner. Wallace's running mate was retired U.S. Air Force General Curtis LeMay.|$|E

50|$|The leading {{candidate}} was incumbent president Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, running {{for his first}} term after the 2011 constitutional referendum. He ran as the candidate of the Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea, a coalition of ten parties, and was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>win.</b> At {{the time of the}} election, Obiang was the longest serving African president, having been in power since 1979.

25|$|After the Democrats {{nominated}} Governor Woodrow Wilson of New Jersey, Roosevelt did not <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> {{the general}} election, as Wilson had compiled a record attractive to many progressive Democrats {{who might have}} otherwise considered voting for Roosevelt. Roosevelt still campaigned vigorously, and the election developed into a two-person contest between Wilson and Roosevelt despite Taft's presence in the race. Roosevelt respected Wilson, but the two differed on various issues; Wilson opposed any federal intervention regarding women's suffrage or child labor (he viewed these as state issues), and attacked Roosevelt's tolerance of large businesses.|$|E
25|$|In West Germany, {{the battle}} becomes {{a war of}} {{attrition}} that the Soviets <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> through slow and sustained advances. The Soviets refuse to acknowledge NATO air superiority, and many West German towns are completely destroyed by artillery fire during the advance. A NATO air attack on the Soviet lines kills CINC-West (a Moscow favourite); Alekseyev's superior is assigned to replace him. Alekseyev becomes second-in-command of the attacking Soviet army group based in Stendal, and is angered to see the Soviet Army's failure to achieve a rapid victory, witnessing a failed advance towards the village of Bieben. He temporarily takes over command of a decapitated tank division and leads a successful attack on the town of Alfeld, finally giving the Red Army the breakthrough it needs. Eventually, Sergetov, after a meeting with his father, presents Alekseyev with documents that suggest that West Germany has been negotiating with the Soviets for a ceasefire under relatively favourable terms in neutral India, although he suspects {{it to be a}} trap. Alekseyev is promoted to CINC-West himself. As the Operational Manoeuvre Group forces start to deploy, NATO looks likely to lose all of Germany east of the Weser River.|$|E

The ceremony took place on February 27, 2002, with Tool winning the award for their song [...] "Schism".|$|E

500|$|In 1996, while {{appearing}} in The Rover at the Salisbury Playhouse, Bathurst got an audition for the Granada Television comedy pilot Cold Feet. He arrived for the audition [...] "bearded and shaggy", {{on account of}} his role in the play and did not <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the role of upper-middle class management consultant David Marsden. The role in the pilot was only minor and created at the last minute to support characters played by James Nesbitt and Helen Baxendale; the only character note in the script about David related to his high salary. Bathurst identified the character as merely a [...] "post-Thatcherite whipping boy".|$|E
500|$|Fitzgerald was {{nominated}} for the [...] "Best Young Actor" [...] at the 2010 Inside Soap Awards for her portrayal of Abi [...] though lost out to Coronation Streets, Alex Bain, who plays Simon Barlow. Fitzgerald won the award for Best Dramatic Performance from a Young Actor or Actress at the 2012 British Soap Awards an award which Tony Stewart from the Daily Mirror said was [...] "well deserved". Fitzgerald {{said she did not}} <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the award. In January 2012, Kate White of Inside Soap praised both Fitzgerald and her character, saying [...] "In Fitzgerald, EastEnders has the brightest young star in soap. The rest of her family are getting all the juicy stuff right now, but Abi's destined for great dramatic things. Mark our words". Her colleague, Steven Murphy, said Inside Soap had [...] "long admired" [...] Fitzgerald.|$|E
500|$|The {{event was}} {{organised}} as a round-robin tournament {{in which each}} of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July. [...] Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were Austria, Czechoslovakia, India, Poland and the USSR; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing {{as a result of the}} boycott, having failed to qualify initially. All of the matches were played at Dynamo Minor Arena in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start, and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams. The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had ever seen it before", Chick recalled—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit. They considered themselves serious underdogs and did not <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> a medal.|$|E

500|$|Robert Bathurst was {{appearing}} in The Rover during casting {{and arrived at}} his audition [...] "bearded and shaggy". He did not <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the part of David, the [...] "smooth" [...] management consultant, assuming someone [...] "a lot shinier and flashier" [...] than him would be cast. Langan had seen him in Joking Apart and some other sitcom pilots and was attracted to his [...] "disciplined comic energy". Hermione Norris first read for Rachel but Lowney asked her to read for Karen because her social class matched that of the character, {{and she had a}} good rapport with Bathurst. Other actors appearing are Mark Andrews as Howard, Mark Crowshaw as the waiter, John Griffin as Andrew, David Harewood as the Police Sergeant, Kathryn Hunt as Pru, Pauline Jefferson as the Old Lady, Jeremy Turner-Welch as the Neighbour, and Lewis Hancock as the Evangelist. Mike Bullen makes a cameo appearance as the actor. Bullen insisted on having a line as when he visited the set of The Perfect Match he [...] "felt like a spare part".|$|E
500|$|On September 9, Feldman threw {{seven innings}} of shutout ball against the Cleveland Indians, leading Texas to a 10–0 win. [...] He struck out five, while giving up five singles, raising his record to 16–4, and tying Sabathia and Verlander for the AL lead in victories. [...] He {{became the first}} Rangers pitcher to win 16 games since Kevin Millwood in 2006. [...] It was his seventh win in a row, eighth {{straight}} road victory (a new Texas record), and 12th road win overall in 2009 (another new club record, and tops in the AL). [...] "I'm not doing anything different on the road than I am at home", said Feldman, who had allowed only one run in the last 26.1 innings. [...] "The preparation is the same. [...] I think it's a pretty humbling game, so you can't get too high or too low." [...] He became the first Rangers right-hander to allow just one run over four consecutive starts. [...] Outfielder Marlon Byrd said: [...] "When you have your ace on the mound, you <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>win.</b> You {{get a couple of}} runs early, and you feel you have a 'W' in hand. [...] He has been unbelievable this year when he steps on the mound.... He just keeps getting better." ...|$|E

He noted that the MCB had joined forces with right-wing Christian fundamentalists to oppose every gay law reform from 1997 to 2006. In January 2006, the MCB Chairman Iqbal Sacranie said that homosexuals are immoral, harmful and diseased on BBC Radio 4.|$|E

With the Watergate scandal fresh in the minds of voters, AuCoin became the first Democrat ever elected to the 1st district, winning 56% of the vote to O'Scannlain's 44%.
