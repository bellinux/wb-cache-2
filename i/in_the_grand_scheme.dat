25|$|Hoveyda's plan {{to crack}} down on {{corruption}} became an example of the entrenched ineptitude of many in power. Many important members of the government were corrupt, and the Shah was consistently flattered and schmoozed by them and {{turned a blind eye to}} the problem. The Shah began receiving an increasingly distorted picture of Iranian society, while becoming completely blind to increasing frustration to this rule by regular Iranians, as well as the shortcomings of his own government. Hoveyda's inability to move forward with his personal mandate eventually turned the overtly optimistic prime minister into a cynic. After years of political maneuvering, most of his proposed initiatives were stonewalled by bureaucratic obstacles. During the 1970s, the now veteran Prime Minister became nonchalant when it came to following through with his own convictions. His earlier aggression towards the dysfunctions of an obtrusive system slowly turned into feigned support. Publicly, Hoveyda assumed the notion that the regime in its current state would eventually reform on its own, and that political liberalization was only a small issue <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>scheme</b> of modernization. In private, Hoveyda often lamented over Iran's conditions, admitting to insufficiencies of the state and his own political impotence. The powerlessness of the premier's office was coupled with intricate internal rivalries. Hoveyda had an intensely rough relationship with the likes of Asadollah Alam and Ardeshir Zahedi, son of the famed participant in the 1953 coup against Mossadegh, General Fazlollah Zahedi.|$|E

50|$|Towards {{the end of}} the novel, Ross {{introduces}} the relatively minor character, Miss Hap (196), who plays the role of the hired cook/caretaker of Oreo's father's family. While Miss Hap is only present for a few chapters, her role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grander</b> <b>scheme</b> and themes presented within the novel is potentially significant. <b>In</b> light of <b>the</b> novel's relation to the Post-Soul Aesthetic, Miss Hap is the only character that fully exhibits the one-dimensional and stereotypical qualities of the literary Mammy figure. This is especially evident in her speech, small mannerisms (197, 198), and dialogue directed towards a relatively antiquated, southern slave narrative. She is positioned in direct opposition {{to the rest of the}} characters Oreo encounters within the warped world of the novel, who all, in some way or another, muddy the waters of black and white dichotomies. She serves, in a way, as a dialogue between the new and the old, and while she is viewed as a slightly comical character, especially in her literal naming, it is she who serves as a final tool and solution for the end of Oreo's quest (203).|$|R
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Keith DeCandido {{reviewed}} the episode for Tor.com in June 2011. He summed it up by saying [...] "What a dreadful episode. While it's important <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>scheme</b> of things in what it establishes about Data's background, the episode itself is horrendously bad, from the clumsy script to the embarrassingly inept body-double work." [...] He thought the ending was anticlimactic, and that the characters all acted [...] "as dumb as posts" [...] in the episode. The most positive thing he said of the episode was that [...] "Spiner's teeth marks are all over the scenery when he's onscreen as Lore". DeCandido gave [...] "Datalore" [...] a score of four out of ten. Cast member Wil Wheaton watched the episode for AOL TV in December 2007. While he credited the art direction of the episode, he criticised the story, saying that [...] "it comes down to lazy writing that has things happen because they're supposed to happen, rather than having them happen organically. The characters are credulous when they should be skeptical, the audience isn't surprised by anything after the second act, and there are story problems that should have never gotten past the first draft." [...] He remembered really enjoying the episode as a child, but felt that it didn't hold up on repeat watchings as an adult, and stated that Spiner's [...] "fantastic job creating distinctly different characters in Data and Lore" [...] wasn't enough to remedy the other faults in the episode. He gave it a D grade.|$|E

He complimented Robert Carlock for [...] " [...] in on the narcissistic worldview" [...] of the Dennis character as it [...] "cranked those qualities up to appropriately absurd 30 Rock proportions." [...] In addition, Sepinwall wrote that all of the elements featured in the episode [...] "all came together". Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad was similarly laudatory, writing that it was [...] "one of the most explosively hysterical and imaginative half hours of TV this season, and one of this show's best episodes ever". Time contributor James Poniewozik was favorable to the episode, observing that it was [...] "asily the funniest 30 Rock in months, and probably the whole season." [...] Poniewozik said it [...] "nailed it, from the too-many-good-jokes... to the sweet heart at the center of each character." [...] The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin enjoyed Adam West's cameo, but noted that Tracy's plot [...] "felt awfully shticky and sitcommy to me." [...] He opined that [...] "Apollo, Apollo" [...] was [...] "pretty great" [...] for Jane Krakowski's Jenna, and in conclusion, Rabin said [...] "I had initially pegged this episode as good but not great and essentially minor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>scheme</b> of things but while writing this post I came to realize just how much of it I loved. 30 Rock is pretty great even when it's not that great."

[...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone states [...] "Shot with a poet's eye, Malick's film is a groundbreaker, a personal vision that dares {{to reach for the}} stars." [...] A. O. Scott of The New York Times gave the film much praise and stated, [...] "The sheer beauty of this film is almost overwhelming, but as with other works of religiously minded art, its aesthetic glories are tethered to a humble and exalted purpose, which is to shine the light of the sacred on secular reality". Total Film gave the film a five-star review (denoting 'outstanding'): [...] "The Tree of Life is beautiful. Ridiculously, rapturously beautiful.

[...] Guy Strachan praised the band for [...] "capturing...the raw aggression of the band's delivery" [...] but also suggested that [...] "while it does {{do a very good}} job at capturing a good Maiden show for posterity, by default it contains six songs that have not been issued in a live context before but many of the other ten have featured on damn near every other live album.

40|$|Computational {{audition}} {{has always}} been a subject of multiple theories. Unfortunately very few place audition <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grander</b> <b>scheme</b> of perception, and even fewer facilitate formal and robust definitions as well as efficient implementations. In our work we set forth to address these issues. We present mathematical principles that unify the objectives of lower level listening functions, in an attempt to formulate a global and plausible theory of computational audition. Using tools to perform redundancy reduction, and adhering to theories of its incorporation in a perceptual framework, we pursue results that support our approach. Our experiments focus on three major auditory functions, preprocessing, grouping and scene analysis. For auditory preprocessing, we prove {{that it is possible to}} evolve cochlear-like filters by adaptation to natural sounds. Following that and using the same principles as in preprocessing, we present a treatment that collapses the heuristic set of the gestalt auditory grouping rules, down to one efficient and formal rule. We successfully apply the same elements once again to form an auditory scene analysis foundation, capable of detection, autonomous feature extraction, and separation of sources in real-world complex scenes. Our treatment was designed in such a manner so as to be independent of parameter estimations and data representations specific to the auditory domain. Some of our experiments have been replicated in other domains of perception, providing equally satisfying results, and a potential for defining global ground rules for computational perception, even outside the realm of our five senses.

40|$|Contemporary global {{nomadism}} is {{an emerging}} phenomenon enabled by the far-reaching forces of globalization, whereby people voluntarily chose to embrace lifestyles of continuous mobility be- tween different countries and cultures. This research examines how do nomadic cosmopolitan consumers navigate through diverse constellations of sociocultural environments, marketplace offerings, possessions, experiences and brands while transitioning from one location to another. Following the theoretical paradigms of practice theory, this study advances {{the notion that}} cosmo- politan nomadism is a complex social practice – consisting of material artifacts, skills, routines, teleoaffective structures, and cultural understandings – which attracts and “recruits” individuals, and which becomes a foundational building block of their social life. Based on insight {{from a series of}} phenomenological interviews with nomadic cosmopolitans, it is suggested that consumption emerges through {{and for the sake of}} migrants’ participation as practitioners <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nomadic cos- mopolitan practice. Within this operational context, meanings, doings and material artifacts are orchestrated through three primary dispersed practices of anchoring, immersion and divestment. Consumption varies within each of those practices as they influence the kinds of brands, products and possessions consumers orient themselves towards, or detach from, throughout the temporal phases that segment the length of time one spends in a certain location – namely, phases of arri- val, settling <b>in</b> and departure. <b>The</b> perspective offered by this study illuminates a new theoretical angle through which we can begin to better understand the trajectory of possessions, brands, experiences and beliefs in condi- tions of continuous transnational mobility. It shows that nomadic cosmopolitanism is dynamic and individually differentiated – hence, it is the fact of one’s unique way of engagement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> practice that explains individuated processes of consumption. This research suggests that percep- tions of value and utility, as well as symbolic meaning of objects and activities, pivot around com- plex cognitive structures and subject positions, and evolve continuously as one changes as a practi- tioner, not only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grander</b> <b>scheme</b> of his/her life, but also within the temporal frame of a single residency...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. <b>The</b> <b>GRAND</b> Canal <b>scheme,</b> {{which by}} the {{construction}} of a dike across James Bay would divert 61 % of Hudson Bay’s freshwater budget south, has ecological implications for the North. The formation of ice in Hudson Bay could increase as its pycnocline develops earlier <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spring and deepens <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer and ice breakup is delayed because of the removal of the warm James Bay outflow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spring. A reduction in primary productivity could result because of changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pycnocline’s development, the removal of nutrients normally associated with spring’s melting ice and a decrease in stable stratification periods as the dike removes the dampening action of James Bay on tidal and wind-generated disturbances. Changes in nuuient content and freshwater circulation out of Hudson Bay could potentially affect productivity downstream on the Labrador Shelf, and changes in productivity and ice pack within Hudson Bay would detrimentally affect fishes and marine mammals. Changes to coastal staging areas in both bays would most likely destroy a major portion of the North American migratory bird population. A resurgence of interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>GRAND</b> Canal <b>scheme</b> necessitates further research to provide data for the many unanswered questions concerning the potential ecological impacts of the diversion...|$|R
