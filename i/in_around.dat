5|$|The barony of Aberdour was {{acquired}} in 1126, by Sir Alan de Mortimer, on {{his marriage to}} Anicea, daughter of Sir John de Vipont. Sir Alan built St Fillan's Church, which still stands, next to the castle, <b>in</b> <b>around</b> 1140, and his family probably built the original hall house <b>in</b> <b>around</b> 1200, or possibly even earlier. In 1216, another Alan de Mortimer is recorded granting land to the monks of Inchcolm Abbey. There is no record {{of what happened to}} the de Mortimers, but in the early 14th century, King Robert the Bruce granted Aberdour to his kinsman, Thomas Randolph, Earl of Moray (d. 1332).

Later versions of the Life reveal the high quality of written Old English produced in East Anglia during Ælfwald's reign.
