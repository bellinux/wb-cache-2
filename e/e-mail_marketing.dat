The primary research problem covered in the study is “how can <b>e-mail</b> direct <b>marketing</b> results be measured by using Club Sony Ericsson existing campaign response and customer data? ” In order to gain understanding of the role of <b>e-mail</b> direct <b>marketing</b> campaigns in a loyalty program, a framework is created around the concept of customer relationship.

This work proposes a new method for classifying e-mails into spam and non-spam. First, several e-mail content features are extracted and then those features are used for classifying each e-mail individually. The classification results of three different classifiers (i. e.

40|$|Junk {{e-mail or}} spam is rapidly choking off e-mail as a {{reliable}} and efficient means of communication over the Internet. Although the demand for human attention increases rapidly with the volume of information and communication, the supply of attention hardly changes. Markets are a social institution for efficiently allocating supply and demand of scarce resources. Charging a price for sending messages may help discipline senders from demanding more attention than {{they are willing to}} pay for. Price may also credibly inform recipients about the value of a message to the sender before they read it. This article examines economic approaches to the problem of spam and the results of two laboratory experiments to explore the consequences of a pricing system for electronic mail. Charging postage for e-mail causes senders to be more selective and to send fewer messages. However, recipients did not interpret the postage paid by senders as a signal {{of the importance of the}} messages. These results suggest that markets for attention have the potential for addressing the problem of spam but their design needs further development and testing. spam, Junk, pricing <b>e-mail,</b> <b>market</b> for attention...|$|R
40|$|Since {{communication}} {{plays an}} important role in the work of managers they are likely to be significant users of e-mail in their daily work. Managers are also influential in technology acceptance and in policy formation. Thus investigating e-mail use by managers is particularly relevant to advance the understanding of organisational efforts to maximize benefits and to minimize problems with e-mail communication. This paper reports on the findings of a survey of managerial use of e-mail within Australian and Hong Kong. The results suggest that while the primary use of e-mail is currently for inter-organisational communication and that e-mail is consuming large amounts of managerial time, particularly for more senior managers. A significant proportion of e-mail received did not appear to contribute to productivity, with both personal <b>e-mails</b> and <b>marketing</b> <b>e-mails</b> constituting a significant proportion of received e-mails. The study suggests that e-mail use will grow as individual and organisational experience increases. We suggest that managers need to consider the time demands caused by the growing use of e-mail. 15 page(s...|$|R

The WorldTalk Corporation estimates that over 60 million business people use e-mail [6]. Many more use e-mail purely on a personal basis and the pool of e-mail users is growing daily. And yet, automated techniques for learning to filter e-mail have yet to significantly affect the <b>e-mail</b> <b>market.</b> Here, I attack problems that plague practical e-mail filtering and suggest solutions that will bring us closer to the acceptance of using automated classification techniques to filter personal e-mail.

Results are presented from a number of experiments and show that a system such as ifile could become a useful and valuable part of any e-mail client. 1. INTRODUCTION E-mail clients generally allow users to organize their mail into folders. Netscape Messenger, Pine, Microsoft Outlook, Eudora and EXMH are all examples of this fact. Folders allow the user to organize her mail by meaningful topic. This facilitates more efficient searching when the user is looking for a previously sent or received e-mail. As it becomes easier to store and manipulate documents electronically, the e-mail folder system may become a store for a wide array of documents. Being able to efficiently maintain and search such a collection is an important aspect of any document management system. Mail folders can also serve the purpose of a prioritization system.
