I have not completed my inspection yet, but I am almost certain as to the kind of a report I will make; and I am sure you will be satisfied with it." ...|$|E

[...] <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> to (Herman) Long, the last man caught, and let him know by signs I could hear him stealing." [...] Appearing in 11 games for the 1900 Giants, Taylor compiled a 4–3 record with a 2.45 earned run average (ERA).|$|E

6000|$|... "How could <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>OVER</b> {{the water}} on the BOTTOM of the river? If you were transparent, anyone could see YOUR brains were not working. But I'm sure you could never find the place alone. It has always been hidden from the Oz people." ...|$|R

Then I arise, and {{climbing}} Heaven's blue dome, <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> {{the mountains and}} the waves, Leaving my robe upon the ocean foam; My footsteps pave the clouds with fire; the caves [...] 10 Are filled with my bright presence, and the air Leaves the green Earth to my embraces bare.|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> to the box, and at {{the window}} learned that the next train would not start for two hours and a half.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a bright}} morning in May when <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> from Saint Just with Captain Jan to pay my first {{underground}} visit to Botallack.|$|E
60|$|HIGGINS [with {{professional}} exquisiteness of modulation] <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> everybody! My dear Mrs. Pearce, my dear Pickering, I {{never had}} the slightest intention of walking over anyone. All I propose {{is that we should}} be kind to this poor girl. We must help her to prepare and fit herself for her new station in life. If I did not express myself clearly it was because I did not wish to hurt her delicacy, or yours.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was arranged," [...] Dane {{answered}} ambiguously. [...] "You see, {{he was a}} countryman; and {{the poor}} fellow died soon afterward, anyway. I think <b>I</b> shall <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> to Culmeny." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{reminds me}} that I {{intended}} to have stewed polar bears for supper," [...] continued the giant; [...] "so I think <b>I</b> will <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> into Alaska and catch some." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have not}} been special constable myself to-day--thinking there was rather an {{epidemic}} in that wise abroad. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> {{and looked at the}} preparations, without any baggage of staff, warrant, or affidavit.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> to a {{table where}} I had left my cane and gloves. I heard the whirr of the alarm in the cab below and I turned quickly. Van Sweller was gone.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But as <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> {{the smoking}} ashes under the bright morning sky, I made a discovery. In my trouser pocket were still some loose matches. The box must have leaked {{before it was}} lost.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good evening, Miss Foster. I {{thought that}} <b>I</b> would <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> {{as the weather}} was so beautiful, but I {{did not expect to}} have the good fortune to meet you in the fields." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you in, mate?" [...] he asked, outside. [...] "Seeing {{you were}} not at work {{for the last two}} days, I thought <b>I</b> would <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> and ask you if {{anything}} was the matter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank {{you very}} much," [...] he replied, [...] "but I {{must be in}} my office this evening. I think I shall be obliged to borrow your gig. <b>I</b> will <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> to the field--" ...|$|R
60|$|I heard a snore. I looked around. Tom {{was asleep}} again. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> and punched {{him on the}} jaw. He {{looked at me as}} {{pleasant}} and ungrudging as an idiot. I chewed my pipe and gave it to him hard.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Uncle Eben, I'm so {{glad you}} found Me! <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over,</b> and it's raining, and I don't feel well. Let me go with you, can't I?" [...] asked Billy, casting himself and all his woes upon the strong arm that had laid hold of him.|$|E
6000|$|I felt rather indignant {{at having}} two {{characters}} whom I had admired treated in this cavalier style. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> to the window, and stood looking {{out into the}} busy street.

6000|$|... "Indeed," [...] he pursued, pronouncing {{each word}} carefully, [...] "what is his death to me? If he were lying {{here on the}} floor <b>I</b> could <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> his breast.... The fellow is a mere phantom...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{much good}} ground as <b>I</b> can <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> in two nights {{from the east}} to the west, and from the north to the south as much as <b>I</b> can <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> in three nights, the Jungle took. We let in the Jungle upon five villages; and in those villages, and in their lands, the grazing-ground and the soft crop-grounds, {{there is not one}} man to-day who takes his food from the ground. That was the Sack of the Fields of Bhurtpore, which I and my three sons did; and now I ask, Man-cub, how the news of it came to thee?" [...] said Hathi.|$|R
6000|$|I have [...] "talked" [...] a {{good deal}} with Mr. Shelmardine these past four days. He is {{to be at the}} beach for some weeks longer. This morning he signalled across from the rocks: [...] "I mean to see you at last. Tomorrow <b>I</b> will <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> and pass you." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> to the bedside, {{and leaned}} reverently over the still figure. Suddenly I {{felt as though}} I were turned to stone. The blood in my veins ran cold, I {{staggered}} back. My gaze had been met with an upturned glassy stare {{from a pair of}} wide-opened, deep-set eyes! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, a hotel. I {{suspected}} it all along. I {{picked up a}} tennis racket on the beach the first day; and after that <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> the ridge and through the jungle and I could see {{the roof of the}} hotel. Only," [...] he added rather shamefacedly, [...] "I didn't like to tell her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{deserved}} it, monsieur," [...] said she, {{with a note}} almost of fierceness in her voice. And of such poor mettle are we {{that her}} resentment against that groaning mass of fopperies and wheals sent a thrill of pleasure through me. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> {{to the spot where}} his sword had fallen, and picked it up.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I shan't {{want you}} at all, George. I {{told you so}} yesterday. However, after breakfast <b>I</b> will <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> to the farm with you.

6000|$|... "But {{he may be}} able to give us some information," [...] Louise asserted; [...] "so <b>I</b> propose we <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> to {{the town}} {{tomorrow}} morning and interview him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you see, {{you have}} no {{occasion}} to walk, as you always have your horses. Besides, the weather here is very hot. But in England it is colder, and walking is a pleasure. <b>I</b> have <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> twenty miles a day, many times, not because I had to do it, but as a day's pleasure with a friend." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I artfully managed so that George and <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> {{the lawn}} to {{a bench in}} the shade of a big tree where there was {{something}} or other--I entirely forget what it was--which I said I would show him. Mr. and Mrs. Cheston and Bernard were on the piazza, but I did not ask them to join us.|$|E
60|$|I made {{no great}} {{secret of the}} {{interest}} and attraction I found in Rachel, and the Mores made none of their entire approval of me. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> on the second occasion, and Ridinghanger opened out, a great flower of genial appreciation that I came alone, hiding nothing of its dawning perception that it was Rachel in particular I came to see.|$|E
60|$|George {{was very}} anxious to receive me at his home. The Ram had as yet only a six days licence, so on Sunday {{afternoon}} <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> to tea. It was very warm and still and sunny as I came through Greymede. A few sweethearts were sauntering under the horse-chestnut trees, or crossing the road {{to go into the}} fields that lay smoothly carpeted after the hay-harvest.|$|E
6000|$|If you do {{not answer}} this in four pages, I shall stop the {{enclosed}} fiver at the bank, a step which will lead to your incarceration for life.

6000|$|... "You don't know me, of course," [...] she said, with {{a feeble}} attempt at dignity. [...] "I am Mrs. Baxter. I--I {{used to live}} here long ago. <b>I</b> thought I'd <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> today and see my old home." ...|$|R
