5|$|Both UCLA and Texas {{would lose}} their {{respective}} games; also, Nebraska, which had entered the Big Ten Championship Game at No. 12 in the BCS, was blown out 70–31 by a Wisconsin team that entered the game at 7–5. All of this {{opened the door for}} the winner of the MAC game to enter the top 16. Northern Illinois won and vaulted to #15 in the BCS Standings, earning a spot in the 2013 Orange Bowl. The berth was the first <b>ever</b> <b>for</b> a MAC team in a BCS game, and was also the first BCS berth <b>ever</b> <b>for</b> a one-loss non-AQ team.|$|E
5|$|For the 2012 presidential election, {{opinion polls}} showed Marine Le Pen {{as a serious}} challenger, with a few polls even {{suggesting}} that she could win {{the first round of}} the election. In the event, Le Pen came third in the first round, scoring 17.9% – the best showing <b>ever</b> <b>for</b> the FN.|$|E

5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{it broke}} {{the record for}} the largest first day <b>ever</b> <b>for</b> an {{animated}} feature in sales revenue, on both DVD and Blu-ray. Additionally, {{on the first day of}} its iTunes release, it immediately became the most downloaded Disney film ever.|$|E
5|$|On December 12, 2009, {{the global}} sports network ESPN aired a {{documentary}} on the UM football program, The U, which drew 2.3 million viewers, the most <b>ever</b> <b>for</b> {{a documentary on}} the sports cable network. As of the 2011 National Football League season, UM had the most players active in the NFL of any university in the nation, with 42.|$|E

The film broke records in Switzerland, Finland, United Arab Emirates, Nigeria, Romania and Slovenia. Its Chinese and Indian openings were the second largest <b>ever</b> <b>for</b> foreign-language films.|$|E

5|$|A partial cranial endocast for RAM 14000 was reconstructed from CT scan data, {{the first}} <b>ever</b> <b>for</b> a Parasaurolophus of any ontogenetic stage. The endocast was reconstructed in two sections, {{one on the}} portion of the braincase {{articulated}} with the left half of the skull and the remainder on the disarticulated portion of the braincase. Their relative position was then approximated based on cranial landmarks and comparison with other hadrosaurids. Because of weathering, many of the smaller neural canals and foramina could not be identified for certain.|$|E
5|$|A similar outcome {{followed}} in the 200m World finals. In the semi-final, Gatlin outpaced Bolt – the Jamaican at 19.95 and the American at 19.87. Despite such slow times prior to Beijing, Bolt delivered in the final with his fifth fastest run <b>ever</b> <b>for</b> the 200m at 19.55 seconds. Gatlin failed to reach his early season form and finished almost two-tenths of a second behind Bolt. Bolt's four consecutive wins over 200m at the World Championships was unprecedented and established him clearly as the best ever sprinter at the competition.|$|E
5|$|Academic {{dress is}} {{required}} for examinations, matriculation, disciplinary hearings, and when visiting university officers. A referendum held amongst the Oxford student body in 2015 showed 76% against making it voluntary in examinations – 8,671 students voted, with the 40.2% turnout the highest <b>ever</b> <b>for</b> a UK student union referendum. This was widely interpreted by students as being a vote on not so much making subfusc voluntary, but rather, in effect, abolishing it by default, in that if a minority of people came to exams without subfusc, the rest would soon follow. In July 2012 the regulations regarding academic dress were modified to be more inclusive to transgender people.|$|E

5|$|After the season, Kershaw and the Dodgers {{agreed on}} a seven-year, $215 million, {{contract}} extension. The deal was the richest in MLB history for a pitcher, eclipsing the seven-year, $180 million, contract signed by Justin Verlander the previous year. The average annual value of $30.7 million was also the largest <b>ever</b> <b>for</b> a baseball player, beating the $28 million Roger Clemens received in 2007 and the 10-year, $275 million contract that Alex Rodriguez signed that same year.|$|E

Brisingr sold 45,000copies {{on its first}} day in the United Kingdom and was the fastest-selling children's book {{in the country in}} 2008.

5|$|During {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, the {{relationship}} between Glenn and Metzenbaum was strained. There was a thaw in 1983 (when Metzenbaum endorsed Glenn for president) and in 1988 when Metzenbaum was opposed for reelection by Cleveland mayor George Voinovich. Metzenbaum won, 57 to 41 percent. In his 1980 reelection campaign, Glenn won by the largest margin <b>ever</b> <b>for</b> an Ohio Senator, defeating U.S. Representative Tom Kindness in 1986.|$|E

5|$|Greinke {{agreed to}} a six-year free agent {{contract}} with the Los Angeles Dodgers worth $147 million, on December 8, 2012. The deal, which was finalized on December 10, was the largest <b>ever</b> <b>for</b> a right-handed pitcher {{at the time it}} was signed. It was surpassed a year later by Félix Hernández's seven-year $175 million contract extension with the Seattle Mariners. Greinke later claimed that he chose the Dodgers over the Texas Rangers, who also were pursuing him, primarily because they offered more money.|$|E
5|$|In September 2007, Gilchrist {{played in}} the inaugural World Twenty20. He scored 169 runs at 33.80 as Australia were knocked out by India in the semifinals. Gilchrist then scored 208 runs at 34.66 as Australia took an away ODI series against India 4–2. In November, Gilchrist's peers voted him the {{greatest}} Australian ODI cricketer <b>ever,</b> <b>for</b> which he was awarded an honour at an ACA function before Australia's second Test against Sri Lanka. He was only required to bat once in the Tests, and made 67 not out as Australia swept Sri Lanka aside 2–0.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to directing {{many of his}} own star vehicles, Eastwood has also directed films in {{which he did not}} appear, such as the mystery drama Mystic River (2003) and the war film Letters from Iwo Jima (2006), for which he received Academy Award nominations, the drama Changeling (2008), and the South African biographical political sports drama Invictus (2009).

5|$|In early April 1970, {{the diamond}} was rated {{one of the}} thirty great stones {{of the world and}} placed on display at Parke-Bernet Galleries in New York City. On 16 April 1970, the diamond was sold at auction for $500,000 (allowing for inflation, this would now be $) to Edward J. Hand, a then 48-year-old {{trucking}} firm executive from Greenwich, Connecticut. This was the second highest auction price <b>ever</b> <b>for</b> a diamond at that time, the first being circa $1.1 million for the Taylor-Burton Diamond several years earlier. Six years later, the diamond was placed on display in November 1976 at a charity benefit as a means to attract donors to that benefit.|$|E
5|$|Kung Fu Hustle began {{a limited}} two-week {{theatrical}} run in New York City and Los Angeles on 8 April 2005 before being widely released across North America on 22 April. In its {{first week of}} limited release in seven cinemas, it grossed US$269,225 (US$38,461 per screen). When it was expanded to a wide release in 2,503 cinemas, {{the largest number of}} cinemas <b>ever</b> <b>for</b> a foreign language film, it made a modest US$6,749,572 (US$2,696 per screen), eventually grossing a total of US$17,108,591 in 129 days.

In 2012, The MDNA Tour became the second highest-grossing tour among female artists, only behind the Sticky & Sweet Tour, grossing over US $305 million.
