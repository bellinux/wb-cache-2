5000|$|Levi and Zanetti {{extended}} the Knorr synthesis in 1894 {{to the use}} of acetylacetone (2,4-pentanedione) in reaction with ethyl 2-oximinoacetoacetate. The result was ethyl 4-acetyl-3,5-dimethylpyrrole-2-carboxylate, where [...] "OEt" [...] = R1 = R3 = Me, and R2 = COOEt. The 4-acetyl group could easily be converted to a 4-ethyl group by Wolff-Kishner reduction (hydrazine and alkali, heated); hydrogenolysis, or the use of diborane. Benzyl or tert-butyl acetoacetates also work well in this system, and with close temperature control, the tert-butyl system gives a very high yield (close to 80%). N,N-dialkyl pyrrole-2- and/or 4-carboxamides may be prepared by the use of N,N-dialkyl acetoacetamides in the synthesis. Even thioesters have been successfully prepared, using the method. As for the nitrosation of &beta;-ketoesters, despite the numerous literature specifications of tight temperature control on the nitrosation, the reaction behaves almost like a titration, and the mixture can be allowed to reach even 40 °C without significantly impacting the <b>final</b> <b>yield.</b>|$|E

50|$|Even though corn {{wet-milling}} {{has been}} used for years to produce food products, animal feed and fuel, research in this field is still going on to make the process more and more efficient. Studies have shown that the steeping time can be decreased from 40 hours to 6-8 hours if enzymes like protease are added and the milling is modified to a two-stage procedure. This even eliminates the need of sulphur dioxide. The yield were found to be equivalent to the conventional process.In a similar study, it was shown that adding phytic acid degrading enzyme reduced the steeping time. Phytic acid is present in the corn which largely ends up in corn steep liquor. Adding phytic acid degrading enzymes along with cellulose can decrease the steeping time.Effect of drying was tested on the <b>final</b> <b>yield</b> of corn wet-milling and it was found that decreasing the initial moisture content of corn and increasing the drying air temperature decreased the yield. This is because low water content made protein and starch separation difficult.|$|E
50|$|Naturally {{regenerated}} {{trees in}} an understorey prior to harvesting constitute {{a classic case}} of good news and bad news. Understorey white spruce is of particular importance in mixedwoods dominated by aspen, as in the B15, B18a, and B19a Sections of Manitoba, and elsewhere. Until {{the latter part of the}} last century, white spruce understorey was mostly viewed as money in the bank on a long-term, low interest deposit, with <b>final</b> <b>yield</b> to be realized after slow natural succession, but the resource became increasingly threatened with the intensification of harvesting of aspen. White spruce plantations on mixedwood sites proved expensive, risky, and generally unsuccessful. This prompted efforts to see what might be done about growing aspen and white spruce on the same landbase by protecting existing white spruce advance growth, leaving a range of viable crop trees during the first cut, then harvesting both hardwoods and spruce in the final cut. Information about the understorey component is critical to spruce management planning. The ability of then current harvesting technology and crews employed to provide adequate protection for white spruce understories was questioned by Brace and Bella. Specialized equipment and training, perhaps with financial incentives, may be needed to develop procedures that would confer the degree of protection needed for the system to be feasible. Effective understorey management planning requires more than improved mixedwood inventory.|$|E

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{equation of}} self-thinning, which was {{proposed in the}} logistic theory of plant growth for describing the density effect in self-thinning populations, {{is based on the}} following two fundamental assumptions: one is that the growth of mean phytomass w follows a general logistic equation; the other is that the <b>final</b> <b>yield</b> Y(t), which is pre scribed as the product of the asymptote of mean phytomass W(t) and density P, becomes constant irrespective of P, i. e. the law of constant <b>final</b> <b>yield</b> is assumed. In the light of the basic principle of self-thinning that the relative growth rate of mean phytomass (l/u>) (dw/dt) is given by the sum of the relative growth rate of yield (1 /y) (dy/dt) and the relative mortality (- 1 /P) (dP/dt), the first assumption brings {{to the conclusion that the}} <b>final</b> <b>yield</b> Y(t) is not prescribed by W{t) P, but is prescribed by(l-tn/A (t)) W(t) P (ro, relative mortality; A (f), coefficient of growth), whose value depends on density P except for the special case where both Wit) P and m are independent of P. This inevitable consequence is in conflict with the prescription referring to the <b>final</b> <b>yield</b> Y(t) in the second assumption of the logistic theory of plant growth. As a result, it is suggested that an alternative theory for the density effect in self-thinning populations should be newly constructed to harmonize the assumption referring to the growth of mean phytomass with the assumption referring to the law of constant <b>final</b> <b>yield...</b>|$|E

This strong dependency of the heat of wood pyrolysis on the <b>final</b> char <b>yield,</b> that is in turn highly sensitive to the experimental conditions, can explain the uncertainty of the data for the heat of wood pyrolysis reported in the literature.
