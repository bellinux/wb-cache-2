5|$|<b>Hunting</b> hare with beagles {{became popular}} again in Britain in {{the mid-19th century}} and {{continued}} until it was made illegal in Scotland by the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002 and in England and Wales by the <b>Hunting</b> Act 2004. Under this legislation beagles may still pursue rabbits with the landowner's permission. Drag <b>hunting</b> is popular where <b>hunting</b> is no longer permitted or for those owners who {{do not wish to}} participate in <b>hunting</b> a live animal, but still wish to exercise their dog's innate skills.|$|E

5|$|Beagles were {{developed}} primarily for <b>hunting</b> hare, an activity known as beagling. They {{were seen as}} ideal <b>hunting</b> companions for the elderly who could follow on horseback without exerting themselves, for young hunters who could keep up with them on ponies, and for the poorer hunters who {{could not afford to}} maintain a stable of good <b>hunting</b> horses. Before the advent of the fashion for foxhunting in the 19th century, <b>hunting</b> was an all day event where the enjoyment was derived from the chase rather than the kill. In this setting the tiny beagle was well matched to the hare, as unlike Harriers they would not quickly finish the hunt, but because of their excellent scent-tracking skills and stamina they were almost guaranteed to eventually catch the hare. The beagle packs would run closely together ("so close that they might be covered with a sheet") which was useful in a long hunt, as it prevented stray dogs from obscuring the trail. In thick undergrowth they were also preferred to spaniels when <b>hunting</b> pheasant.|$|E
5|$|Bliege Bird et al. {{observed}} turtle <b>hunting</b> and spear fishing {{patterns in}} a Meriam {{community in the}} Torres Strait of Australia, publishing their findings in 2001. Here, only some Meriam men were able to accumulate high caloric gains {{for the amount of}} time spent turtle <b>hunting</b> or spear fishing (reaching a threshold measured in kcal/h). Since a daily catch of fish is carried home by hand and turtles are frequently served at large feasts, members of the community know which men most reliably brought them turtle meat and fish. Thus, turtle <b>hunting</b> qualifies as a costly signal. Furthermore, turtle <b>hunting</b> and spear fishing are actually less productive (in kcal/h) than foraging for shellfish, where success depends only on the amount of time dedicated to searching, so shellfish foraging is a poor signal of skill or strength. This suggests that energetic gains are not the primary reason men take part in turtle <b>hunting</b> and spear fishing. A follow-up study found that successful Meriam hunters do experience greater social benefits and reproductive success than less skilled hunters.|$|E
5|$|Bred {{primarily}} as <b>hunting</b> dogs, {{their goal is}} to find the bird, send it into the air and then to retrieve it on command after the hunter has shot the quarry. The Russian Spaniel is suited for <b>hunting</b> in marshland, fields, woodland, for birds as well as rabbits and other small game. The breed is also popular in their native Russia as their small size makes them suitable to be kept in busy cities, and easily transported to <b>hunting</b> sites.|$|E

5|$|Fishing and <b>hunting</b> {{are popular}} outdoor {{activities}} in South Dakota. Fishing contributes over $224million to South Dakota's economy, and <b>hunting</b> contributes over $303million. In 2007, over 275,000 <b>hunting</b> licences and 175,000 fishing licences {{were sold in}} the state; around half of the <b>hunting</b> licences and over two-thirds of the fishing licences were purchased by South Dakotans. Popular species of game include pheasants, white-tailed deer, mule deer, and turkeys, as well as waterfowl such as Canada geese, snow geese, and mallards. Targets of anglers include walleye in the eastern glacial lakes and Missouri River reservoirs, Chinook salmon in Lake Oahe, and trout in the Black Hills.|$|E
5|$|Grand Teton National Park is {{the only}} U.S. National Park that permits <b>hunting,</b> but only of elk {{in an effort to}} keep the populations of that species regulated. This {{provision}} was included in the legislation that combined Jackson Hole National Monument and Grand Teton National Park in 1950. While some National Parks in Alaska permit subsistence <b>hunting</b> by indigenous natives and a few other National Park Service managed areas allow <b>hunting</b> under highly regulated circumstances, <b>hunting</b> in U.S. National Parks is not generally allowed. In Grand Teton National Park, hunters are required to obtain Wyoming <b>hunting</b> licenses and be deputized as park rangers. <b>Hunting</b> is restricted to areas east of the Snake River and north of Moran, Wyoming, the hunt is permitted only east of U.S. Route 89. Proponents of continuing the elk hunt, which occurs in the fall, argue that the elk herd would become overpopulated without it, leading to vegetation degradation from overgrazing elk herds. Opponents cite that there has been an increase of predators such as the wolf and grizzly bear in Grand Teton National Park, rendering the annual hunt unnecessary and exposing hunters to attacks by grizzly bears as they become accustomed to feeding on remains left behind from the hunt.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hunt</b> and {{his wife}} Jane had five children: artist Jane Maria <b>Hunt,</b> {{physician}} Jonathan <b>Hunt,</b> painter William Morris <b>Hunt,</b> architect Richard Morris <b>Hunt</b> and early photographer and New York attorney Leavitt <b>Hunt.</b> Following <b>Hunt's</b> death, his wife took their children to Geneva, Paris and Rome for an extended Grand Tour that stretched into a dozen years. The <b>Hunt</b> children were able to study the arts in European academies and become part of an American expatriate community in Europe. Four of <b>Hunt's</b> children returned to America. The fifth, his namesake son Jonathan, remained in Paris, where he studied medicine at the University of Paris and subsequently practiced medicine until his early death, a suicide in 1874. (Jonathan <b>Hunt's</b> son William Morris <b>Hunt</b> also committed suicide, at the Isles of Shoals in New Hampshire.) <b>Hunt's</b> nephew was Chicago architect Jarvis <b>Hunt.</b>|$|R

5|$|<b>Hunting</b> {{is often}} {{performed}} alone, but L. colubrina may also {{do so in}} large numbers {{in the company of}} <b>hunting</b> parties of giant trevally and goatfish. This cooperative <b>hunting</b> technique {{is similar to that of}} the moray eel, with the banded sea kraits flushing out prey from narrow crevices and holes, and the trevally and goatfish feeding on fleeing prey.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hunting</b> is {{permitted}} {{in most of}} Black Moshannon State Park. It helps to prevent an overpopulation of animals and the resulting overbrowsing of the understory. The most common game species are ruffed grouse, eastern gray squirrel, wild turkey, and white-tailed deer. However, the <b>hunting</b> of groundhogs is prohibited.|$|E
5|$|In {{recent years}} only villages in South Malaita Island have {{continued}} to hunt dolphin. In 2010, the villages of Fanalei, Walende, and Bitamae signed a MoU with the non-governmental organization, Earth Island Institute, to stop <b>hunting</b> dolphin. However, in early 2013 the agreement broke down and some men in Fanalei resumed <b>hunting.</b> The <b>hunting</b> of dolphin continued in early 2014.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hunt</b> Petroleum Corporation was an {{oil and gas}} {{exploration}} and production company formed in 1950.

5|$|In the 1970s, {{the price}} of raccoon pelts rose again {{to a high of}} 25 to 30 dollars each, and some people made their entire income from coon <b>hunting.</b> It was {{possible}} to catch ten raccoons per night in well-populated areas, with good dogs. One outdoors writer estimated that in 1985 there were 30 to 40 thousand coon hunters in Michigan alone. This market <b>hunting</b> largely died out by the late 1980s, and it is estimated that during the fur boom trapping took more raccoons than <b>hunting</b> with dogs.|$|E
5|$|Inadvertent <b>hunting</b> {{or running}} of deer by coonhounds is {{particularly}} problematic for hunters, as <b>hunting</b> deer with dogs is illegal in most states.|$|E
5|$|Mallards {{are one of}} {{the most}} common {{varieties}} of ducks hunted as a sport. The ideal location for <b>hunting</b> mallards is considered to be where the water level is somewhat shallow. <b>Hunting</b> mallards might cause the population to decline in some places, at some times, and with some populations. In certain countries, the mallard may be legally shot but is protected under national acts and policies. For example, in the United Kingdom, the mallard is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which restricts certain <b>hunting</b> methods or taking or killing mallards.|$|E
