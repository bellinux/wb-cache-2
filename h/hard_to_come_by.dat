5|$|Some solid {{performances}} in the early 1930s led to rumours {{that he would be}} brought into the Australian team in order to retaliate against England's Bodyline tactics during the 193233 Ashes series. However, this never eventuated and thereafter Halcombe increasingly found state selection <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by.</b> In retirement he became a well known sports commentator for the Australian Broadcasting Commission, providing description of cricket and Australian rules football matches until his retirement from the media in 1968.|$|E
5|$|There {{continued}} to be rebellions and resistance to William's rule, but Hastings effectively marked the culmination of William's conquest of England. Casualty figures are <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by,</b> but some historians estimate that 2,000 invaders died along with about twice that number of Englishmen. William founded a monastery {{at the site of}} the battle, the high altar of the abbey church supposedly placed at the spot where Harold died.|$|E
5|$|After a poor debut {{season for}} Victoria, Harvey did not gain {{first-class}} selection in 1948–49 and vacancies were <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by</b> {{as the season}} was purely domestic with no touring Test team, so all of Australia's international representatives were available for the whole season. Harvey was selected for a Second XI match against New South Wales but failed to make an impact, scoring two runs in each innings as the Victorians completed a 195-run win. Harvey took the wicket of H Hinman in the first innings, ending with 1/24 from four overs.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{his initial}} success, playing time was <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by</b> in 1963 and Jiménez found himself {{splitting}} time between Triple-A {{and the big}} leagues {{for the remainder of}} the decade.|$|R
50|$|Birch {{stayed at}} Wolves {{for five years}} as the club (unsuccessfully) tried {{to break into the}} Premier League. He was almost an ever-present under Turner, but found regular {{appearances}} <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by</b> after Wolves appointed another former manager of his, Graham Taylor.|$|R
50|$|The sizes {{vary from}} narrow hall carpets to large room designs, often up to 4 m × 5 m. The larger rugs {{tend to be}} very rare and <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by.</b> Similarly, older rugs, often coveted by collectors, can be {{extremely}} costly.|$|R
5|$|From 1929 to 1934 {{she studied}} at Columbia University, where Edward Kasner stoked an {{interest}} in mathematics, and co-authored Way's first published academic paper. She graduated with her BS in 1932. She next went to the University of North Carolina, where John Wheeler stimulated {{an interest in}} nuclear physics, and she became his first PhD student. Because jobs were <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by</b> during the Great Depression, she stayed on {{as a graduate student}} after completing the requirements of her PhD.|$|E
5|$|Beardmore was {{sufficiently}} impressed with Shackleton to offer financial support, but other donations proved <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by.</b> Nevertheless, in February 1907, Shackleton {{presented to the}} Royal Geographical Society his plans for an Antarctic expedition, the details of which, under the name British Antarctic Expedition, {{were published in the}} Royal Society's newsletter, Geographic Journal. The aim was the conquest of both the geographical South Pole and the South Magnetic Pole. Shackleton then worked hard to persuade others of his wealthy friends and acquaintances to contribute, including Sir Philip Lee Brocklehurst, who subscribed £2,000 (2011 equivalent £157,000) to secure a place on the expedition; author Campbell Mackellar; and Guinness baron Lord Iveagh, whose contribution was secured less than two weeks before the departure of the expedition ship Nimrod. On 4 August 1907, Shackleton was appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order, 4th Class (MVO; the present-day grade of Lieutenant).|$|E
5|$|On 31 August, Smith joined Queens Park Rangers on {{an initial}} three-month loan deal. His move was made {{permanent}} in January 2011, with Smith having agreed a three-year deal {{for a fee}} of around £1.5 million. Smith provided the assist for Heiðar Helguson in a 2–1 win against Crystal Palace on 2 October and has since made many positive contributions to the QPR team but found starts <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by</b> {{in the early days}} of his Rangers career. He scored his first goal for the club against Reading on 6 November, and also netted a late equaliser in a 1–1 draw with former club Portsmouth three days later, scoring a last-minute penalty to earn QPR a point and keep their unbeaten start to the season intact. On 20 August 2011, he scored his and QPR's first goal of the 2011–12 Premier League season, in a 1–0 away win against Everton.|$|E
5000|$|... {{national}} titles, however, were <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by.</b> In 1956, HSV {{reached the}} DFB-Pokal final but were beaten by Karlsruher SC. This {{was followed by}} losses in the finals of the national championship to Borussia Dortmund in 1957 and Schalke 04 in 1958.|$|R
50|$|Opportunities at provincial level proved <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by</b> {{and he only}} managed 2 {{appearances}} for Western Province, both {{of which}} came during the 2013 Vodacom Cup. This limitation in game time saw him move to Australia to link up with the Perth based Western Force.|$|R
5000|$|ZooMumba {{revolves}} around two currencies, PetPennies and ZooDollars. PetPennies is the currency {{that is more}} readily available as numerous jobs and concession stands can produce zoo pennies. ZooDollars are a bit <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by</b> and {{they are used to}} purchase special/rare animals and exquisite decorations for the zoo.|$|R
5|$|Poulton came to {{prominence}} in youth cricket by captaining New South Wales to the Under-17 national championships in 2000. In 2002–03, {{she made her}} senior debut for New South Wales in the Women's National Cricket League (WNCL). She found runs <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by</b> in her first three seasons and {{was in and out}} of the team frequently, aggregating only 24 runs in her second and third seasons combined. Despite this, she regularly captained Australia's Under-19 and Under-23 teams during this time, leading the latter on a successful tour of Sri Lanka in 2004. In 2005–06, made a substantial impact on the WNCL for the first time, scoring 325 runs, more than twice her previous best season's total, playing in the first of five consecutive WNCL triumphs for New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of John's reign {{there was a sudden}} change in prices, as bad harvests and high demand for food {{resulted}} in much higher prices for grain and animals. This inflationary pressure was to continue {{for the rest of the}} 13th century and had long-term economic consequences for England. The resulting social pressures were complicated by bursts of deflation that resulted from John's military campaigns. It was usual at the time for the king to collect taxes in silver, which was then re-minted into new coins; these coins would then be put in barrels and sent to royal castles around the country, to be used to hire mercenaries or to meet other costs. At those times when John was preparing for campaigns in Normandy, for example, huge quantities of silver had to be withdrawn from the economy and stored for months, which unintentionally resulted in periods during which silver coins were simply <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by,</b> commercial credit difficult to acquire and deflationary pressure placed on the economy. The result was political unrest across the country. John attempted to address some of the problems with the English currency in 1204 and 1205 by carrying out a radical overhaul of the coinage, improving its quality and consistency.|$|E
5|$|While {{food was}} {{extremely}} <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by,</b> {{an even more}} pressing need was obtaining drinking water. Thirst {{and the search for}} water are mentioned in most of the Robinsons' memoirs. The most common sources originally included toilet cisterns, boilers, and standing water found inside bathtubs. As these ran out, those in hiding were forced to risk sneaking access to wells, which were often guarded by German soldiers. Some memoirs describe long periods observing a particular well and waiting for a chance to obtain a quick drink. Another method involved obtaining polluted sewer water from the canals, and then filtering it through coals wrapped in rags. Generally, records indicate that whatever scant water supplies existed were shared fairly among individuals hiding as a group. In at least one instance, one person was unable to withstand the thirst and drank the whole group's water supply. As a result, Jakub Wiśnia, a former Gęsiówka inmate and after its liberation, a Home Army soldier, was court-martialed by his fellow group members and sentenced to death. The execution was to be postponed until after liberation, but when that occurred, the Robinsons were so overwhelmed with joy, the crime was forgiven and the sentence was never mentioned again.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} season, under Jacques Santini {{and then}} Martin Jol, he found appearances <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by</b> {{and had two}} loan spells, first at Coventry City, and then Wolverhampton Wanderers, linking up with his former manager, Glenn Hoddle. He scored once for Wolves, in a 2-1 win over Reading on 30 April 2005.|$|R
2500|$|As {{the season}} progressed, though, Irish found runs <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by</b> and he passed 50 only {{once more in}} an innings, making an unbeaten 75 in the return match with Sussex at Worthing. He was injured soon after this innings and, {{according}} to Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, [...] "after missing many matches he decided to give up full-time cricket".|$|R
50|$|Baker {{found his}} chances <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by</b> when manager Mike Walker brought in {{experienced}} former Arsenal player Colin Hill. He played his last game for Colchester on 2 January 1988 in a 2-0 defeat to Peterborough at London Road. Having made 55 appearances for the U's, Baker was released {{and returned to}} his former club Billericay Town.|$|R

There are further improvements planned for the stadium, including measures to ease crowd congestion, use of new technology and improved corporate facilities.|$|E
25|$|In recent scholarship, Bart Ehrman has {{championed the}} view that in general, it is {{impossible}} to either prove or disprove supernatural events such as miracles using the historical method, for proving them would require belief in a supernatural world not amenable to historical analysis, and disproving them would require historical evidence that is usually <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most march composers {{come from}} the United States or Europe, and {{have some type of}} musical background. The most popular march composers existed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, mainly because modern march dedicators are <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by.</b> The {{following}} is a list of march music composers whose marches are frequently performed in the United States.|$|E

He subsequently found goals <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by,</b> scoring a total of 18 in 43 league appearances {{up to the end}} of the 1947-48 season when he was transferred to Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic in September.|$|R
50|$|They were league runners-up in 1998-99, {{and after}} the Chiltonian League merged to form the Hellenic Football League, Peppard were placed in Division One East. Success then was <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by,</b> and by 2002 the club's future was in grave danger and they had quit the Hellenic Football League {{at the end of}} the 2002-03 season.|$|R
25|$|Johanson's career rose rapidly {{since her}} first {{classroom}} {{teaching in the}} North York schools. Later some other districts of the country noticed her performances and began to invite her in schools and universities all over the country. Johanson's humour and frankness make her a popular speaker at Canadian universities. She frequently packs auditoriums to capacity, making even standing room <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by.</b>|$|E
25|$|Recycling {{has been}} a common {{practice}} for most of human history, with recorded advocates {{as far back as}} Plato in the fourth century BC. During periods when resources were scarce and <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by,</b> archaeological studies of ancient waste dumps show less household waste (such as ash, broken tools, and pottery)—implying more waste was being recycled in the absence of new material.|$|E
25|$|The Christianization of the Rus' {{people is}} {{supposed}} to have begun in the 860s and was the first stage in the process of Christianization of the East Slavs which continued well into the 11th century. Despite its historical and cultural significance, records detailing the event are frustratingly <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by,</b> and it seems to have been forgotten by the time of Vladimir's Baptism of Kiev in the 980s.|$|E
50|$|Stead found {{first team}} starts <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by</b> the {{following}} season {{as he fell}} behind James Beattie and Billy Sharp in the pecking order but still managed to make over thirty appearances and score six goals. During the subsequent transfer window Stead signed on loan for Championship rivals Ipswich Town {{with a view to}} a permanent move.|$|R
5000|$|In the UK, [...] "Ring of Ice" [...] {{was chosen}} as the {{follow-up}} single, where it became a top 20 hit. Further hits proved <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by</b> however as another UK release, [...] "Madonnas Eyes" [...] failed to reach the top 75, (it did however reach No. 5 in France and No. 12 in South Africa).|$|R
50|$|Date palm jaggery is {{becoming}} <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by</b> due <b>to</b> {{the decrease in}} the number of date palms in West Bengal and the shift of members of the Shiuli community, traditional producers of nolen gur from date palm juice, to other professions. Similarly, kanakchur rice is a local variant which grows only in winter and through traditional fertiliser-free techniques only.|$|R
25|$|In 1979, a 1,500 square {{kilometer}} {{area in the}} Negev {{was declared}} a protected nature reserve, rendering it out of bounds for Bedouin herders. In conjunction with this move the Green Patrol, a law compliance unit was established that disbanded 900 Bedouin encampments and cut goat herds {{by more than a}} third. With the black goat nearly extinct, black goat hair to weave tents is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by.</b>|$|E
25|$|Olympus Mons is an {{unlikely}} landing location for automated space probes {{in the near}} future. The high elevations preclude parachute-assisted landings because of insufficient atmospheric thickness to slow the spacecraft down. Moreover, Olympus Mons stands {{in one of the}} dustiest regions of Mars. A mantle of fine dust covers much of the terrain, obscuring the underlying bedrock and possibly making rock samples <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by.</b> The dust layer would also likely cause severe maneuvering problems for rovers.|$|E
25|$|Automobile {{parking is}} {{at a premium}} in Lakeview, {{especially}} during special events such as Chicago Cubs home games at Wrigley Field. Special residential parking permits are required for parking on some Lakeview streets; in commercial areas, limited metered parking is available. High-priced public parking lots are available for visitors and baseball fans but are <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by.</b> Lakeview residents on blocks with parking restrictions may purchase temporary parking permit slips, available at aldermanic constituent offices, for guests invited to private residences.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} {{opportunity}} finance has gained increased traction in recent years, both from political movements and economic necessity. The current economic climate in the United States {{has raised the}} demand for creative financing even for established businesses, as traditional bank loans for nonprofits and small businesses became <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>by</b> after the market crashed {{in the autumn of}} 2008.|$|R
