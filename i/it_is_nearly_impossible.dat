5|$|The {{three main}} {{industries}} on Svalbard are coal mining, tourism, and research. In 2007, there were 484 {{people working in}} the mining sector, 211 people working in the tourism sector and 111 people working in the education sector. The same year, the mining gave a revenue of NOK2.008 billion (227,791,078 USD), tourism NOK317 million (35,967,202 USD) and research NOK142 million (16,098,404 USD) In 2006, the average income for economically active people was NOK494,700; 23% higher than on the mainland. Almost all housing {{is owned by the}} various employers and institutions and rented to their employees; {{there are only a few}} privately owned houses, most of which are recreational cabins. Because of this, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> to live on Svalbard without working for an established institution.|$|E
25|$|With modern {{synthetic}} dyes, {{nearly every}} colour and shade {{can be obtained}} so that without chemical analysis <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> to identify, in a finished carpet, whether natural or artificial dyes were used. Modern carpets can be woven with carefully selected synthetic colours, and provide artistic and utilitarian value.|$|E
25|$|A {{blood clot}} or other solid mass, {{as well as}} an air bubble, can be {{delivered}} into the circulation through an IV and end up blocking a vessel; this is called embolism. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> to inject air through a peripheral IV at a dangerous rate. The risk is greater with a central IV.|$|E
50|$|Wazir Khan was {{the chief}} {{musician}} or nayak at the court of Nawab Hamid Ali Khan of Rampur. Without the blessings and patronage of Wazir Khan, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> for a musician to find employment in the durbar.|$|R
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> deemed that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> {{to protect}} every {{critical}} asset at every location, therefore {{the focus was}} directed on protecting the critical Defense Infrastructure. The critical Defense Infrastructure is the critical assets essential to providing mission assurance.|$|R
50|$|Without {{this basic}} education, the report found <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> {{to go on}} to high school or college. African {{children}} are missing this link that allows them to have a chance in trade or to go beyond their villages.|$|R
25|$|The anthropic {{principle}} states that fundamental {{laws of the}} universe work specifically {{in a way that}} life would be possible. The {{anthropic principle}} supports the Rare Earth Hypothesis by arguing the overall elements that are needed to support life on Earth are so fine-tuned that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> for another just like it to exist by random chance.|$|E
25|$|To {{weigh the}} {{advantages}} between centrifugal compressors {{it is important}} to compare 8 parameters classic to turbomachinery. Specifically, pressure rise (p), flow (Q), angular speed (N), power (P), density (ρ), diameter (D), viscosity (μ) and elasticity (e). This creates a practical problem when trying to experimentally determine the effect of any one parameter. This is because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> to change one of these parameters independently.|$|E
25|$|Far {{ultraviolet}} light is absorbed effectively by the neutral {{components of the}} ISM. For example, a typical absorption wavelength of atomic hydrogen lies at about 121.5 nanometers, the Lyman-alpha transition. Therefore, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> to see light emitted at that wavelength from a star farther than a few hundred light years from Earth, because {{most of it is}} absorbed during the trip to Earth by intervening neutral hydrogen.|$|E
50|$|As a child, she was {{attracted}} to the work done by stonemasons near her home {{and she wanted to}} become an artist. However, in 1940s Mexico <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> for a woman to become a professional sculptor. She began by teaching herself.|$|R
50|$|To {{make matters}} worse, the urban {{hospital}} {{was left in}} ruins, so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> to treat the wounded. A great many people {{were able to take}} refuge in the emergency military hospital, or a converted mental hospital located in nearby Weinsberg.|$|R
50|$|Lea {{noted that}} the world-wide {{depression}} affected the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan in 1931. The value of cotton, gum arabic, hides and animals fell. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> for the administration to collect herd taxes. This led {{to a reduction in}} government oversight of various regions.|$|R
25|$|These {{findings}} {{may be useful}} for aligning Schwann cells in a nervous system injury to promote the formation of bands of Bungner, which are crucial for maintaining the endoneurial tube that guides the regrowing axons back to their targets. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> to align Schwann cells by external physical techniques; thus, the discovery of an alternative technique for alignment is significant. However, the technique developed still has its disadvantages, namely {{that it takes a}} considerable amount of energy to sustain the magnetic field for extended periods.|$|E
25|$|Floaters {{are able}} to catch and refract light in ways that {{somewhat}} blur vision temporarily until the floater moves to a different area. Often they trick persons who are troubled by floaters into thinking they see {{something out of the}} corner of their eye that really is not there. Most persons come to terms with the problem, after a time, and learn to ignore their floaters. For persons with severe floaters <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> to completely ignore the large masses that constantly stay within almost direct view.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the ozone}} layer absorbs UVB {{ultraviolet}} light from the sun, ozone layer depletion increases surface UVB levels (all else equal), {{which could lead to}} damage, including increase in skin cancer. This was the reason for the Montreal Protocol. Although decreases in stratospheric ozone are well-tied to CFCs and to increases in surface UVB, there is no direct observational evidence linking ozone depletion to higher incidence of skin cancer and eye damage in human beings. This is partly because UVA, which has also been implicated in some forms of skin cancer, is not absorbed by ozone, and because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> to control statistics for lifestyle changes over time.|$|E
50|$|During World War II, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> for {{the meat}} {{processing}} plants operating {{in the area to}} purchase new equipment. Because the company was located near several {{meat processing plants}}, Bettcher Dieweld was called upon to keep the old machinery running through repairs and maintenance.|$|R
5000|$|Because of its {{controversial}} {{nature and}} content, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> for Levine {{to find a}} publisher—one prospective publisher even called it [...] "radioactive." [...] University of Minnesota Press eventually agreed to publish the book, despite cries of outrage from {{the right wing of}} Minnesota's political establishment.|$|R
25|$|Also {{important}} {{is the quality of}} the material: the earliest tinfoil recordings wore out fast. Once the tinfoil was removed from the cylinder <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> to re-align in playable condition. The earliest soft wax recordings also wore out quite fast, although they have better fidelity than the early rubber discs.|$|R
25|$|Supporters of ITER {{emphasize}} {{that the only way}} to test ideas for withstanding the intense neutron flux is to experimentally subject materials to that flux, which is one of the primary missions of ITER and the IFMIF, and both facilities will be vitally important to that effort. The purpose of ITER is to explore the scientific and engineering questions that surround potential fusion power stations. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> to acquire satisfactory data for the properties of materials expected to be subject to an intense neutron flux, and burning plasmas are expected to have quite different properties from externally heated plasmas. Supporters contend that the answer to these questions requires the ITER experiment, especially in the light of the monumental potential benefits.|$|E
25|$|Grouper {{are often}} found around reefs. They have stout bodies and large mouths. They are not built for long-distance or fast swimming. They {{can be quite}} large, and lengths over a meter and weights up to 100kg are not uncommon. They swallow prey rather than biting pieces off it. They do not have many teeth {{on the edges of}} their jaws, but they have heavy {{crushing}} tooth plates inside the pharynx. They lie in wait, rather than chasing in open water. They are found in areas of hard or consolidated substrate, and use structural features such as ledges, rocks, and coral reefs (as well as artificial reefs like wrecks and sunken barges) as their habitat. Their mouth and gills form a powerful sucking system that sucks their prey in from a distance. They also use their mouth to dig into sand to form their shelters under big rocks, jetting it out through their gills. Their gill muscles are so powerful that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> to pull them out of their cave if they feel attacked and extend those muscles to lock themselves in. There is some research indicating that roving coral groupers (Plectropomus pessuliferus) sometimes cooperate with giant morays in hunting.|$|E
25|$|Swahili {{is used in}} {{parliamentary}} debate, in {{the lower}} courts, and as a medium of instruction in primary school. English is used in foreign trade, in diplomacy, in higher courts, and as a medium of instruction in secondary and higher education, The Tanzanian government, however, has plans to discontinue English as a language of instruction. In connection with his Ujamaa social policies, President Nyerere encouraged the use of Swahili to help unify the country's many ethnic groups. Approximately 10 percent of Tanzanians speak Swahili as a first language, and up to 90 percent speak it as a second language. Many educated Tanzanians are trilingual, also speaking English. The widespread use and promotion of Swahili is contributing to the decline of smaller languages in the country. Young children increasingly speak Swahili as a first language, particularly in urban areas. Ethnic community languages (ECL) other than Kiswahili are not allowed as a language of instruction. Nor are they taught as a subject, though they might be used unofficially (illegally) in some cases in initial education. Television and radio programmes in an ECL are prohibited, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> to get permission to publish a newspaper in an ECL. There is no department of local or regional African Languages and Literatures at the University of Dar es Salaam.|$|E
50|$|As <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> {{to succeed}} in {{motorsport}} without some activities in Formula 2, 3 or Formula Ford, most of the well-known racing drivers in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s owe their careers to Ford Kent to some extent, and the current historic motor racing depends heavily on the Kent-based engines.|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{the legends}} of hauntings also come by {{stories of the}} {{mausoleum}} doors collapsing to the ground revealing no caskets interred inside. This has been {{explained by the fact}} the building was only a receiving tomb for winter months. During cold months of the year <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> to prepare a gravesite.|$|R
5000|$|Near {{the end of}} the 1990s, IBM {{shut down}} SOMobjects {{download}} sites and never put them back online. SOM 3.0 DTK for WinNT can't be found on IBM FTP, despite lots of other legacy stuff lying around freely. Despite general availability of SOM 3.0 for WinNT, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> to locate until the end of 2012.|$|R
500|$|The {{shells of}} {{juvenile}} queen conches are strikingly different in appearance {{from those of}} the adults. Noticeable is the complete absence of a flared outer lip; juvenile shells have a simple sharp lip, which gives the shell a conical or biconic outline. In Florida, juvenile queen conches are known as [...] "rollers", because wave action very easily rolls their shells, whereas <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> to roll an adult specimen, due to its shell's weight and asymmetric profile. Subadult shells have a thin flared lip that continues to increase in thickness until death.|$|E
500|$|Conservationists {{disagree}} on {{when is the}} proper time {{to give up on}} a population that is becoming a hybrid swarm, or to try and save the still existing pure individuals. Once a population becomes a complete mixture, the goal becomes to conserve those hybrids to avoid their loss. Conservationists treat each case on its merits, depending on detecting hybrids within the population. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> to formulate a uniform hybridization policy, because hybridization can occur beneficially when it occurs [...] "naturally", and when hybrid swarms are the only remaining evidence of prior species, they need to be conserved as well.|$|E
500|$|The North Korean troops {{suffered}} {{heavily in}} the fight for Masan, and most became casualties in the attack. By mid-September, the NK 7th Division was reduced to just 4,000 men, a loss of 6,000 from when it was committed to the perimeter. Only 2,000 from the NK 6th Division returned to North Korea, a loss of 80 percent of its strength. [...] Up to 3,000 troops were captured as they attempted to return to North Korea. The attacking force of over 20,000 had been reduced to only 6,000 {{by the end of the}} fights around Masan. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible,</b> however, to calculate how many were lost in each individual engagement.|$|E
50|$|In 1989 Evergreen was {{chartered}} in Arizona but in 1995 redomesticated to Vermont. Evergreen <b>was</b> started because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> for campgrounds, RV {{parks and}} resorts to find insurance {{in the mid}} to late 1980s because of the hard insurance market that companies were in as part of the insurance cycle. Richard Hartford began Evergreen USA to help the camping industry.|$|R
50|$|As {{they went}} on their way, Wongang Ami found that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> to {{continue}} the harsh journey because of her pregnancy. Finally, she pleaded with Sara Doryeong to sell herself and her unborn child as a slave. Sara Doryeong accepted the plea, and tried to sell Wongang Ami for 300 coins and the fetus for 100 coins to a wealthy man named Cheonnyeon Jangja.|$|R
50|$|The boom in rail {{transport}} in Britain during the 1840s meant {{that people were}} able to travel further and with less inconvenience than they ever had before. Inter-school sporting competitions became possible. While local rules for athletics could be easily understood by visiting schools, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> for schools to play each other at football, as each school played by its own rules.|$|R
500|$|The main {{argument}} {{represented in}} the collection is that, rather than economics and wealth, modern-style poverty is described by a [...] "wildly dysfunctional set of values". A number of chapters discuss the [...] "ferocious young egoist" [...] that is meant to represent male youths who are violent and obsessive toward their significant others. Dalrymple also writes about his views on the [...] "destruction of...family ties", arguing that without family ties <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> to rise out of the underclass. These issues, among others, are described as resulting from the [...] "intellectual foundation... makes a permanent underclass possible". This {{is meant to be}} directed against intellectuals and liberals that form the many ideas absorbed into the mentality of the underclass.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{isotopes}} are theoretically {{expected to}} double beta decay. [...] In most cases, the double beta decay is so rare that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> to observe against the background. However, the double beta decay of [...] (also an alpha emitter) has been measured radiochemically. [...] Two of the nuclides ( [...] and [...] ) from the table below can also theoretically single beta decay but this is extremely suppressed {{and has never been}} observed.|$|E
2500|$|Reform's {{emergence}} fragmented {{the conservative}} vote into two parts– Reform and the weakened PC Party. [...] Reform was generally seen as too extreme for the liking of {{urban and suburban}} voters east of Manitoba. [...] Conflicts with the federal PCs resulted in wasted resources, donor frustration, {{the lack of a}} coherent provincial political machine for either party, and vote splitting during elections. [...] Reform was never able to gain footing in Atlantic Canada or Quebec; it was not only hampered by Manning's inability to speak French, but its uncompromising stances on federalism and official bilingualism. [...] As <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> to form a government without substantial support in both Ontario and Quebec, the Liberal Party was seen as having a secure hold on power.|$|E
50|$|Unless the {{listener}} was in Cherokee County, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> {{to receive the}} AM broadcast, due to its low power 1,000 watt daytime only transmitter. WZZQ transmits from the original WAGI studio on Providence Road in Gaffney and broadcast in the daytime only until August 23, 2009, when the translator W282AX was added at 104.3 to add nighttime programming and a wider signal range.|$|R
50|$|To {{strengthen}} {{the defense of}} Changchun and Jilin City, Chen Cheng ordered part of the nationalist force to be airlifted to Changchun from Shenyang, and the Newly Organized 1st Army also turned to Changchun to reinforce {{the defense of the}} city. Knowing that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> to take the fortified strongholds with huge defending forces, the communist wisely concluded the autumn offensive on November 5, 1947.|$|R
