40|$|We studied two InAs/InP {{quantum wire}} samples with {{different}} growth conditions. The photoluminescence {{of the first}} sample reveals up to six distinct peaks, while the second has only two pronounced photoluminescence peaks that are attributed to <b>flat</b> <b>wires</b> with heights that differ by exactly one monolayer. Despite the large band offsets in this system, the photoluminescence energy shift of these peaks with a magnetic field applied in {{the plane of the}} wires shows that the extent of the exciton wave function in the growth direction is much larger than the wire height, i. e. the wave function spills over into the InP. Moreover, the exciton wave function shrinks for increasing wire height. The wave function spill-over is qualitatively confirmed in the first quantum wire sample. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V.

50|$|For round wires {{it can be}} seen, that {{an order}} within the winding (approx. densest package of the round wire cross {{sectional}} areas) results in fewer air gaps, {{which leads to a}} higher fill factor. This on the other hand increases the efficiency of the electrical device and an improved heat conductivity of the winding.An optimal manufactured winding is defined, where the wires in the upper layer are in the grooves of the lower layer for at least 300 degrees of the coil circumference. The wires occupy a dense package which is called “orthocyclic winding”. The opposite of this would be a random wire structure within the winding space, which is called “wild winding.” Due to the fact that a round wire will create air gaps that aren’t electrically used, the fill factor is always smaller than one. In order to achieve higher fill factors, rectangular or <b>flat</b> <b>wire</b> can be used. This can be wound on flat or upright.|$|E
50|$|In production, it was {{expected}} that the wires could be scaled down to around 50 nm. There were two arrangements considered for racetrack memory. The simplest was a series of <b>flat</b> <b>wires</b> arranged in a grid with read and write heads arranged nearby. A more widely studied arrangement used U-shaped wires arranged vertically over a grid of read/write heads on an underlying substrate. This would allow the wires to be much longer without increasing its 2D area, although the need to move individual domains further along the wires before they reach the read/write heads results in slower random access times. Both arrangements offered about the same throughput performance. The primary concern in terms of construction was practical; whether or not the three dimensional vertical arrangement would be feasible to mass-produce.|$|R

The rear contact is formed by screen-printing a metal paste, typically aluminium. Usually this contact covers the entire rear, though some designs employ a grid pattern. The paste is then fired at several hundred degrees Celsius to form metal electrodes in ohmic contact with the silicon. Some companies use an additional electro-plating step to increase efficiency.

50|$|On 11 August actual {{construction}} began; on 16 August Tritton {{decided to}} fit a wheeled tail to assist in steering. On 9 September the Number 1 Lincoln Machine, as the prototype was then known, made its first test run in the yard of the Wellington Foundry. It {{soon became clear that}} the track profiles were so flat that ground resistance during a turn was excessive. To solve this, the suspension was changed so that the bottom profile was more curved. Then the next problem showed up: when crossing a trench the track sagged and then would not fit the wheels again and jammed. The tracks were also not up to carrying the weight of the vehicle (about 16 tons). Tritton and Lieutenant Walter Gordon Wilson tried several types of alternative track design, including balatá belting and <b>flat</b> <b>wire</b> ropes. Tritton, on 22 September, devised a robust but outwardly crude system using pressed steel plates riveted to cast links and incorporated guides to engage {{on the inside of the}} track frame. The track frames as a whole were connected to the main body by large spindles. This system was unsprung, as the tracks were held firmly in place, able to move in only one plane. This was a successful design and was used on all First World War British tanks up to the Mark VIII, although it limited speed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—By closely {{examining}} the resonant phenomena of a suspended, <b>flat</b> <b>wire</b> resonator, this paper speculates {{the existence of}} the fast-wave mode causing the anomalous resonance that cannot possibly be explained by the well-known bound mode. Followed by proposing a guiding structure model that allows the assessment of the effects of ground plane and sidewalls (external objects) on the guiding properties, the numerical accuracy of the full-wave spectral-domain approach method for the electrically large model is validated by performing the rigorous convergence study. A series of measurements on the resonator are conducted for the same guiding structure of various lengths, confirming that the anomalous resonance is indeed caused by a fast-wave {{in the form of a}} space-wave type leaky mode which also exhibits almost identical modal currents to those of the bound mode.

The extra computational cost of including the end cap effect is small.
