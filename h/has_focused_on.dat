5|$|Efforts {{to better}} {{understand}} the mechanisms of sebum production are underway. The aim of this research is to develop medications that target and interfere with the hormones that are known to increase sebum production (e.g., IGF-1 and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone). Additional sebum-lowering medications being researched include topical antiandrogens and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor modulators. Another avenue of early-stage research <b>has</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> how to best use laser and light therapy to selectively destroy sebum-producing glands in the skin's hair follicles in order to reduce sebum production and improve acne appearance.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{economists have}} also {{highlighted}} power and inequality issues within families and households. For example, Randy Albelda shows that responsibility for care work influences the time poverty experienced by single {{mothers in the}} United States.

The work of the Equality Studies Department at University College Dublin {{such as that of}} Sara Cantillon <b>has</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> inequalities of domestic arrangements within even affluent households.|$|E

5|$|Media {{coverage}} of the movement <b>has</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> popular leaders, such as Hensley, and the deaths of ministers by snakebite have received particular attention. Practitioners of snake handling continue to view Hensley as a great man. Kimbrough recorded a discussion with an advocate of snake handling who dismissed Hensley's personal failings as slanderous fabrications. His advocacy, leadership, and– in particular– his personal charisma were important factors in the advancement of the movement.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} {{feminism}} in India {{can be divided}} into three phases: the first phase, beginning in the mid-eighteenth century, initiated when male European colonists began to speak out against the social evils of Sati; the second phase, from 1915 to Indian independence, when Gandhi incorporated women's movements into the Quit India movement and independent women's organisations began to emerge; and finally, the third phase, post-independence, which <b>has</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> fair treatment of women at home after marriage, in the work force and right to political parity.|$|E

A widespread and potentially lethal human infectious disease, at its peak malaria infested every continent, except Antarctica.

5|$|The {{shortcomings}} {{noted above}} limit {{the usefulness of}} the Nazarov cyclization reaction in its canonical form. However, modifications to the reaction focused on remedying its issues continue to be an active area of academic research. In particular, the research <b>has</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> a few key areas: rendering the reaction catalytic in the promoter, effecting the reaction with more mild promoters to improve functional group tolerance, directing the regioselectivity of the elimination step, and improving the overall stereoselectivity. These have been successful to varying degrees.|$|E
