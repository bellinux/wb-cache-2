5000|$|The {{involvement}} of Turkey {{in the operation}} has considerably strained its relations with Iraq. Turkey has 1,500 to 2,000 soldiers in Iraq, including 500 Turkish soldiers deployed to a base near Bashiqa, where they trained 1,500 Iraqi Sunni volunteers, mainly Turkmens, and Arabs to recapture Mosul from ISIL. Turkey's participation is against {{the wishes of the}} Iraqi government, which has said the Turks are violating Iraq's sovereignty. Turkey has refused to withdraw its forces. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told the Turkish parliament on 1 October, [...] "We will {{play a role in the}} Mosul liberation operation and no one can prevent us from participating," [...] and said their presence was to ensure that Mosul did not fall to Kurdish or Shia control and become a threat to Turkey. Turkey's presence was criticized by Kurds in northern Iraq, and thousands of protestors demonstrated at the Turkish Embassy in Baghdad on 18 October, demanding Turkish forces withdraw from Iraq. The United States has reportedly attempted to persuade Iraq to cooperate with Turkey on the Mosul offensive. Al-Abadi declined the offer of Turkish assistance, saying, [...] "I know that the Turks want to participate. We tell them thank you, this is something the <b>Iraqis</b> <b>will</b> handle and the <b>Iraqis</b> <b>will</b> liberate Mosul and the rest of the territories." [...] However, on 23 October, Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım announced Turkish troops had fired on ISIL positions near Mosul after requests for assistance from the Peshmerga.|$|E
5000|$|By late November 2007, with {{still more}} {{evidence}} that the surge and other tactics and developments had led to a significant lessening of the civil violence in Iraq, Clinton acknowledged the successes but said that the underlying equation had not changed: [...] "Our troops are {{the best in the}} world; if you increase their numbers they are going to make a difference. The fundamental point here is {{that the purpose of the}} surge was to create space for political reconciliation and that has not happened, and there is no indication that it is going to happen, or that the <b>Iraqis</b> <b>will</b> meet the political benchmarks. We need to stop refereeing their civil war and start getting out of it." ...|$|E
5000|$|On November 27, 2008, the Iraqi Parliament {{ratified}} a Status of Forces Agreement {{with the}} United States, establishing that U.S. combat forces {{will withdraw from}} Iraqi cities by June 30, 2009, and all U.S. forces will be completely out of Iraq by December 31, 2011, but allowing for further negotiation if the Iraqi Prime Minister believes Iraq is not stable enough. The pact requires criminal charges for holding prisoners over 24 hours, and requires a warrant for searches of homes and buildings that {{are not related to}} combat. U.S. contractors will be subject to Iraqi criminal law. If U.S. forces commit still undecided [...] "major premeditated felonies" [...] while off-duty and off-base, they will be subject to the still undecided procedures laid out by a joint U.S.-Iraq committee if the U.S. certifies the forces were off-duty. A referendum of <b>Iraqis</b> <b>will</b> be held in mid-2009 on the pact, which may require Coalition forces to leave by the middle of 2010. Parliament also passed another U.S.-Iraqi bilateral pact called the Strategic Framework Agreement, aimed at ensuring minority Sunni interests and constitutional rights.|$|E

40|$|In October 2012, I began a monthlong {{visit to}} Iraq to begin {{developing}} a database that documents {{the destruction of}} heritage in the country over a crucial nine-year period (2003 – 2009). This database will enable researchers to more fully understand {{the extent of the}} destruction and will help the Iraqi government and international community to prioritize the heritage sites in Iraq that most urgently need protection and restoration. The primary purpose of the database, however, is to examine the extent {{of the relationship between the}} recorded destruction of heritage sites and spikes of violence, as documented in existing and reliable measures such as the Iraq Body Count database.

40|$|This article {{appeared}} in Strategic Insights (May 2003), v. 2 no. 5 As the military conflict for Iraq concluded, a new battle began over {{the best way}} to rebuild the Iraqi economy. On the one side are those who believe that, by establishing proper institutions and rules, the <b>Iraqis</b> <b>will</b> be able to rebuild their own economy without an extended period of outside oversight and massive financial assistance. Another side sees the necessity of substantial infusions of foreign assistance and technical support {{over an extended period of}} time. A possible third group primarily led by the French and Russians feels that a new Iraqi government should set a high priority on paying back the tens of billions of dollars in loans taken by Saddam's government (Rahn 2003). While differing somewhat on ends and means, no doubt all sides would agree that any recovery of the Iraqi economy will entail successfully addressing a daunting set of tasks: (a) what rules should be used by an Iraqi Central Bank in issuing new dinars? and (b) how should the exchange rate be set with regard to other currencies? This document focuses on these issues in an attempt to identify the best monetary system for facilitating Iraq's reconstruction, restructuring, and future economic growth...|$|E

50|$|By late 2007, {{violent and}} {{indiscriminate}} attacks directed by AQI against Iraqi civilians had severely damaged their image and caused {{the loss of}} support among the population, isolating the group. In a major blow to AQI, thousands of former Sunni militants that previously fought along with the group started to actively fight AQI and also work with the American and Iraqi forces, starting {{with the creation of}} the Anbar Awakening Council, so called because of its Anbar origins. The group spread to all Sunni cities and communities and some Shiite areas and adopted the broader name Sons of Iraq. The Sons of Iraq was instrumental in giving tips to coalition forces about weapons caches and militants resulting in the destruction of over 2,500 weapons caches and over 800 militants being killed or captured. In addition, the 30,000 strong U.S. troop surge supplied military planners with more manpower for operations targeting al-Qaeda in Iraq, The Mujahadeen Shura Council, Ansar Al-Sunnah and other terrorist groups. The resulting events led to dozens of high-level AQI leaders being captured or killed. Al-Qaeda seemed to have lost its foothold in Iraq and appeared to be severely crippled due to its lack of vast weapons caches, leaders, safe havens, and <b>Iraqis</b> <b>willing</b> to support them. Accordingly, the bounty issued for Abu Ayyub-al-Masri AKA Abu Hamza al-Muhajer was eventually cut from $5 million down to a mere $100,000 in April 2008.|$|R
