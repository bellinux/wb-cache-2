25|$|Temporarily {{buoyed by}} an inheritance, Nancarrow {{traveled}} to New York City in 1947 {{and bought a}} custom-built manual punching machine to enable him to punch the piano rolls. The machine was an adaptation of one used in the commercial production of rolls, and using <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> work and very slow. He also adapted the player pianos, increasing their dynamic range by tinkering with their mechanism and covering the hammers with leather (in one player piano) and metal (in the other) so as to produce a more percussive sound. On this trip to New York, he met Cowell and heard a performance of John Cage's Sonatas and Interludes for prepared piano (also influenced by Cowell's aesthetics), which would later lead to Nancarrow's modestly experimenting with prepared piano in his Study No. 30.|$|E
25|$|With silver cloth {{covering}} the entire painting, {{except for the}} face and hands, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> for art historians to determine in what period the painting was created. In 1927, the silver cover was removed {{for the first time}} in decades. The painting was analyzed and restored. Based on the new data gathered during the restoration, Mieczysław Skrudlik came to a conclusion that the painting was completed around 1630–50 and linked it with another painting in the Corpus Christi Church in Kraków, created by artist Luke in 1624. Mary Kałamajska Saeed in her 1990 thesis argued that Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn was a work of a local artist and was inspired by contemporary Flemish mannerist painter Marten de Vos through an engraving of Thomas de Leu. In 1993, on the occasion of pope's visit, the painting was restored and one of its planks was dated based on its tree-rings. The scientists concluded that the oak grew in 1434–1620.|$|E
25|$|However, it is {{also clear}} from the law tracts that the {{practice}} of Sick Maintenance was being discarded. Thus, while Críth Gablach mentions some of what each individual is entitled to while being nursed according to his rank, it also mentions that the practice was no longer in use, and instead an additional fine encompassed the same provisions the injurer would have had to pay for under sick maintenance. Bretha Crólige does not mention anything about the practice being obsolete. However, it does mention that certain types of person could not be maintained because of the difficulty in doing so. Thus <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to provision those of the highest rank and obviously impossible to find a substitute to do their work. Certain professionals could similarly be difficult. On the other hand, a number of persons could cause difficulty to the people maintaining the victim. Such troublesome individuals included the insane and women likely to cause trouble for those nursing them.|$|E

25|$|Arkan {{became an}} {{untouchable}} criminal figure in Belgrade {{and all of}} the former Yugoslavia. He was really so powerful, so strong financially that no one could do anything about him.... In 1993, I learned that Željko Ražnatović, Arkan, had in Belgrade kidnapped and taken to Erdut and there killed Isa Lero... also a man from the criminal underground who had come into conflict with Arkan. I even found a witness to the murder. I publicly accused Arkan. I submitted a report to the police. The police inspectors came to see me. We talked about it. I gave them all the information I had, but then the police inspector told me that they were aware of it but that they were unable to prove it because of the fear among the potential witnesses. So the police were quite well-informed about his criminal activities, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to prove anything or to bring charges because his support network was so widespread, and this can be shown through various newspaper articles and so on. In one television statement, I told him when we were debating on TV, that he had pulled a sock over his head more often than I had pulled one on my feet.|$|E
500|$|Kirchherr {{described}} {{how difficult it}} was to be accepted as a female photographer in the 1960s: [...] "Every magazine and newspaper wanted me to photograph the Beatles again. Or they wanted my old stuff, even if it was out of focus, whether they were nice or not. They wouldn't look at my other work. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> for a girl photographer in the 60s to be accepted. In the end I gave up. I've hardly taken a photo since 1967." [...] Kirchherr was quoted as saying that When We Was Fab (Genesis Publications 2007), would be her last book of photographs: [...] "I have decided it is time to create one book in which I am totally involved so that it contains the pictures I like most, printed the way I would print them, even down to the text and design.... This book is me and that is why it will be the last one. The very last one." ...|$|E

Mrs. Kennedy liked the design, but resistance began in Cambridge, the {{first proposed}} site for the building, {{as soon as the}} project was announced. Many community members worried that the library would become a tourist attraction, causing particular problems with traffic congestion. Others worried that the design would clash with the architectural feel of nearby Harvard Square. By the mid-70s, Pei tried proposing a new design, but the library's opponents resisted every effort. These events pained Pei, who had sent all three of his sons to Harvard, and although he rarely discussed his frustration, it was evident to his wife. [...] "I could tell how tired he was by the way he opened the door {{at the end of the}} day," [...] she said.

500|$|Idol briefly responded {{once more}} to the {{negative}} reception the album received on two occasions. In 1996, Idol gave an interview for his website {{in which he was}} asked if he'd pursue the style of Cyberpunk for a future album. Idol addressed the question by first explaining his interpretation of the failure of the album. [...] "You see the thing about Cyberpunk is that {{it was supposed to be}} like a homemade record, much like these rap bands are doing, all made really on home equipment. But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to make people understand that I was sort of making an alternative record. They don't allow you to make an alternative record..." [...] He then stated that he would not be pursuing the same style with any future album. In a 2005 interview, Idol simply stated [...] "...the idea that I was trying to do an overground-underground record just wasn't understood at the time." [...] Tony Dimitriades, a prominent music industry producer and manager, interpreted Idol's response at the time. [...] "He realized at that point, 'Well, if that's what people think, maybe I lost touch with my public.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Barlow {{decided to}} leave the role of Mavis in 1997, having played it for 26 years. It was {{reported}} that she had quit following the axing of Peter Baldwin, who played her screen husband Derek Wilton. At the time Coronation Street was undergoing off-screen changes following the introduction of a new executive producer, Brian Park, dubbed [...] "the axeman" [...] in the press after he culled many characters from the regular cast. The actress Jean Alexander, who played the character of Hilda Ogden in the serial, went to the press in protest at the news. She wrote: [...] "Peter Baldwin and Thelma Barlow were a wonderfully funny couple, but they've killed off Derek and now Mavis is about to leave. Even all the humour has been taken out of scenes between Mavis and Rita." [...] Park suggested that when he took over as head producer there was a general feeling among the programme-makers that [...] "Derek and Mavis had had their day". Barlow has stated her belief that the producers killed off Derek {{as a result of her}} own desire to leave. She said: [...] "It was sort of cruel, really; I mean, they could have killed Mavis off. It was a new director and a new producer, and they wanted to make a big news splash. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> for Peter [...]" [...] The village of Cartmel, near Grange-over-Sands, enjoyed a boost in tourism attributed to the exposure given to it by Mavis's storyline.|$|E

[...] Since most of these singles had long gone out of print, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to get these legally, so in 2000, Kent released the 2CD B-side collection B-sidor 95–00 (B-Sides 95–00). It featured 21 b-sides, re-recorded versions of two of these and two totally new songs. [...] One of them, [...] "Chans" [...] (Chance), was also released as a single. [...] A hidden bonus track, featuring Finnish vocals performed by drummer Markus Mustonen, was also featured.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1920s, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> for a {{musician}} playing a pickup-equipped guitar {{to find an}} amplifier and speaker to make their instrument louder as the only speakers that could be bought were [...] "radio horns of limited frequency range and low acoustic output". The cone speaker, widely used in 2000s-era amp cabinets, was not offered for sale until 1925. The first amplifiers and speakers could only be powered with large batteries, which made them heavy and hard to carry around. When engineers developed the first AC mains-powered amplifiers, they were soon used to make musical instruments louder.|$|E
2500|$|Buttigieg {{began the}} 1989–90 season in an {{unfamiliar}} right back role and gradually {{fell out of the}} first team picture. The departure of Perryman as manager and his replacement Phil Holder's tactical change to a long ball game saw Buttigieg further frozen out and after being transfer-listed in November 1990, he was released in May 1991. Buttigieg made 47 appearances during his time at Griffin Park and the 22 caps he won for Malta during that period make him Brentford's most capped international. In 2001, Buttigieg remarked that he [...] "felt an outsider at the club for a while. Joyce Neate at the club was lovely to me and some of the players too, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> for me I remember".|$|E

Disillusioned with the car's unreliability, Ford pulled out of the project, with Michael Kranefuss {{going so far as to}} say that [...] "it was the worst project I've ever been involved in." [...] Even if the Mustang GTP had been reliable, the car had questionable aerodynamics, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to drive when the fuel loads were low.

The man was ordered to lie on the pavement before being handcuffed and arrested, about 20metres from Downing Street. [...] He was also ordered to open his jacket and shirt before being taken by the police, presumably to allow police to see any hidden explosives {{that may have been}} on his person. He {{did not appear to be}} carrying any bags, and did not seem to be wearing a belt, although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> for the reporter to see.

2500|$|Ethan Mordden writes, [...] "It was {{a flawed}} voice. But then Callas sought to capture in her singing not just beauty but a whole humanity, and within her system, the flaws feed the feeling, the sour plangency and the strident {{defiance}} becoming {{aspects of the}} canto. They were literally defects of her voice; she bent them into advantages of her singing." [...] Giulini believes, [...] "If melodrama is the ideal unity of the trilogy of words, music, and action, {{it is impossible to}} imagine an artist in whom these three elements were more together than Callas." [...] He recalls that during Callas's performances of La traviata, [...] "reality was onstage. What stood behind me, the audience, auditorium, La Scala itself, seemed artifice. Only that which transpired on stage was truth, life itself." [...] Sir Rudolf Bing expressed similar sentiments:Once one heard and saw Maria Callas—one can't really distinguish it—in a part, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to enjoy any other artist, no matter how great, afterwards, because she imbued every part she sang and acted with such incredible personality and life. One move of her hand was more than another artist could do in a whole act.|$|E
2500|$|In {{promoting}} the album, frontman and lead vocalist Stephan Jenkins recounted a pleasant experience in recording the album, referring {{to it as}} [...] "too much fun and feeling like...a complete recording group for the first time...We had these jam sessions that were fun". He also commented {{that it had been}} more collaborative than their prior album; bassist Arion Salazar became more involved in the writing and production, while drummer Brad Hargreaves was involved in the creative process for the first time, as he had joined the band late into their sessions for the first album. However, in retrospect, Jenkins painted a much more grim picture, citing time constraints, label pressure from Elektra Records, and isolation between members, stating: [...] "We did the last album in six months, we just whipped it out, and there's some things on that album, on the second album, that I'm so proud of...but the second album suffered from a kind of coldness almost. That's done in part because we were never in the studio at the same time, never rehearsed the songs together, never played them together. I did my best to, to produce that record and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to do. Then we succumbed to the time pressures from Elektra to get the album out in six months which we did." ...|$|E

2500|$|One {{chapter of}} SBVT's Unfit for Command {{questioned}} Kerry's statements {{that he was}} in Cambodia during the war. [...] Kerry did not claim to have been sent on a covert mission to Cambodia on Christmas Eve, 1968. [...] Rather, he believed at the time he had crossed the border while on a patrol near the border, during which the boats were ambushed and later came under friendly fire from South Vietnamese soldiers. [...] None of Kerry's crewmates confirmed being sent to Cambodia. One of Kerry's crewmen, SBVT member Steven Gardner, asserted that it was physically impossible to cross the Cambodian border, as it was blocked and patrolled by PBRs (a type of patrol boat); however, Kerry's boat was evidently patrolling with PBRs during the mission in question. [...] Some crewmembers have, moreover, stated that they may at some point have entered Cambodia without knowing it. [...] James Wasser, who was on PCF-44 on that December mission, while saying that he believed they were [...] "very, very close" [...] to Cambodia, did not recall actually crossing over; he also stated that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to tell their exact position in the border area. Kerry's own journal entry on this, written the night of the mission, does not specifically say they entered Cambodia. However, it does state that PCF-44 was somewhere [...] "toward Cambodia" [...] to provide cover for two smaller patrol boats, and in sarcasm, that he considered messaging Christmas greetings to his commanders [...] "from the most inland Market Time unit" [...] and that a court martial for the incident [...] "would make sense" [...] In addition, George [...] Elliott noted in Kerry's fitness report that he had been in an ambush during the 24-hour Christmas truce, which began on Christmas Eve.|$|E
