40|$|International audienceWhen {{a subject}} is walking blindfolded {{straight}} ahead towards a previously seen target, the brain must update an internal representation {{with respect to}} the environment. This study examines whether the information given by the vestibular system is necessary for this simple path integration task and gives a quantitative description of locomotor behaviour during the walk by comparing ten normal and seven bilateral labyrinthine-defective (LD) subjects. Each subject performed 20 blindfolded walks (EC) and ten walks with eyes open (EO) towards a target attached to the floor 4 m in front of them; these walks were made at different velocities. The positions of head, trunk and feet were recorded using a 3 D motion analysis system. No significant difference was found between normal and LD groups in terms of the distance error of reaching the target, while LD subjects showed a larger lateral error. Path curvature, expressed as the standard deviation of the angle between the direction of one step and straight ahead, was found to be significantly larger for LD subjects in the EC condition, demonstrating their instability when walking without vision. Mean walking velocity was lower for LD subjects than for normal subjects in both EC and EO conditions. Both groups walked faster with eyes open; LD subjects increased their velocity by increasing step length, normal subjects by increasing step <b>frequency.</b> Head <b>stabilisation</b> in the frontal plane during locomotion was not significantly different between LD and normal subjects, whereas both head and trunk rotation were slightly larger in LD subjects during blindfolded walking.

40|$|Stabilisation of sawteeth due to #alpha#-particles or ion {{cyclotron}} resonance heating (ICRH) is well-established experimentally and understood theoretically: it arises from third adiabatic invariant conservation for trapped fast ions processing around the torus in a time shorter than the m 1 internal kink mode period. This mode has frequency #omega# #approx# #omega#_*_i, the bulk ion diamagnetic <b>frequency,</b> and so <b>stabilisation</b> requires #omega#_D_h > or #approx# #omega#_*_i, where #omega#_D_h is the fast ion precession frequency. In JET this condition is easily satisfied by ICRH ions with energies #epsilon# #approx# MeV; for NBI ions with #epsilon# < or #approx# 100 keV it is generally only marginally satisfied. Clear evidence for NBI stabilisation of sawteeth has nevertheless been found, for example in TEXTOR. In recent JET discharges, with beam injection energies of up to 140 keV, sawtooth periods #tau#_s_a_w #approx# 500 ms have been observed. To investigate the processes determining #tau#_s_a_w in these discharges we have used a transport code (PRETOR) to implement a model that was developed to predict the sawtooth period in ITER and has been applied successfully to TCV.

40|$|Pedestrians {{walking on}} a {{laterally}} oscillating structure are known to impose ground reaction forces that contain frequency components at the structural oscillation frequency. These forces arise due to {{the interaction between the}} balancing pedestrian and oscillating structure on which they walk. They are therefore often termed self-excited (SE) forces. The dynamic influence of these SE forces is to alter the apparent modal mass and damping of the structure. However, in order to gain {{a deeper understanding of the}} root cause of these forces, it is necessary to consider the biomechanical response to base motion, as it is this that ultimately generates the ground reaction force (GRF). This paper presents observations from a test campaign in which subjects walked on a laterally oscillating treadmill. A 3 -dimensional motion capture camera system was used to track the position of 31 active markers, placed on each subject during walking tests. A range of frequencies and amplitudes were tested. The initial objective was to employ inverse dynamics to reproduce the GRF. This was successfully validated against the directly measured GRF. Marker data was then used to investigate subject’s balance response to base motion. Data relating to a single subject is presented in detail here. Various observations have been made, the most significant of which are that the underlying cause of the SE GRF was confirmed as resulting from a periodic variation of lateral foot placement position. The frequency of variation was found to be equal to the modulus of the difference between the lateral forcing and oscillation frequencies. The subject’s tendency to alter their gait was induced by a sinusoidally varying inertia force imposed due to the base oscillation. Periodic gait width alteration ceased when the pedestrian’s lateral forcing frequency was matched to the base oscillation <b>frequency,</b> explained by <b>stabilisation</b> of the phase relationship between the forcing and oscillation frequencies. Finally, amplitude modulation was found to be a qualitatively suitable mathematical analogue for the biomechanical behaviour observed...|$|R

The lasers for ESAs ADM-Aeolus and EarthCARE missions require frequency stabilities of 4 and 10 MHz rms at a wavelength of 355 nm and a line width below 50 MHz at 30 ns pulse duration[1]. Transferred to the fundamental wavelength of the laser systems the stability requirement is 1. 3 and 3. 3 MHz, respectively.

The transmission {{spectrum of the}} Fabry-Perot cavity was used {{as opposed to the}} traditionally used reflected spectrum.

The phase sensitive system made use of the optical heterodyne technique to detect changes in the phase of the system. A lock-in amplifier was used to filter and mix the input signals to generate the error signal. This error signal may then be used to generate a control signal via a PID controller. An error signal was realised at a wavelength of 1556 nm which correlates to an optical frequency of 1. 926 THz.

Instead of requiring, for example, bulky multi-wavelengths lasers, additional opto-electronic components or very-largebandwidth detectors, the compact LDA presented here uses three semiconductor lasers whose difference frequencies are controlled very accurately by a microcontroller <b>frequency</b> <b>stabilisation</b> system. In this way, the difference frequencies, which act as carrier frequencies for the measuring information, can be tailored very easily to the measuring task. Thus the signal to noise ratio can be optimised and the required bandwidth of the detection system may be kept small.

Thus two LDA signals are obtained in the base band.

40|$|As an {{alternative}} to state-of-the-art laser <b>frequency</b> <b>stabilisation</b> using ultra-stable cavities, it has been proposed to exploit the non-linear effects from coupling of atoms with a narrow transition to an optical cavity. Here we have constructed such a system and observed non-linear phase shifts of a narrow optical line by strong coupling of a sample of strontium- 88 atoms to an optical cavity. The sample temperature of a few mK provides a domain where the Doppler energy scale is several orders of magnitude larger than the narrow linewidth of the optical transition. This makes the system sensitive to velocity dependent multi-photon scattering events (Dopplerons) that affect the cavity field transmission and phase. By varying the number of atoms and the intra-cavity power we systematically study this non-linear phase signature which displays roughly the same features as for much lower temperature samples. This demonstration in a relatively simple system opens new possibilities for alternative routes to laser stabilization at the sub 100 mHz level and superradiant laser sources involving narrow line atoms.
