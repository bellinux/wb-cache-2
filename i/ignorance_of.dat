40|$|Ignorance has {{tremendous}} impact on political stability, distribution of rights, andtheorization of social justice, yet it remains undertheorized. Focusing on the Anglo-American political scene, I ask how contemporary ignorance differs from past renditions {{with respect to}} the parameters of what it can be used for in different political orders, the particular ways of challenging its operation, and the problems around it. To expand the understanding <b>of</b> <b>ignorance,</b> I apply the genealogical method Michel Foucault employed to expose that knowledge is a historical practice or a continuous struggle of imposing power that (re) produces itself. I argue that ignorance is not a pejorative condition, but a historical practice—practice <b>of</b> <b>ignorance</b> regardless <b>of</b> intention and not just narrowly the opposite of not knowing—affecting political order, and various strategies for contesting how it works become viable and impossible with changes in <b>ignorance’s</b> framework. Combininganalysis <b>of</b> historical and visual materials with textual analysis of the conception ofignorance in the writings of King James I, Thomas Hobbes, Adam Smith, and John Rawls, I find three significant historical shifts in ignorance’s framework: (1) the shift from ignorance’s unequal distribution that revolves around the royal prerogative to the equalization of the distribution under the rule of law; (2) the secularization <b>of</b> <b>ignorance</b> that disassociates it from sin; and (3) the shift from metaphysical framing <b>of</b> <b>ignorance</b> to economic framing with time or lack thereof at the core. The investigation contributes to the scholarship on each of the thinkers in focus by establishing the role that understanding <b>of</b> <b>ignorance</b> plays in their political theories. Just as importantly, the genealogical route enables me to lay out the contemporary alternative approaches to the operation <b>of</b> <b>ignorance</b> and call for more vigorous contestation of its operation for instance with respectto how practices <b>of</b> <b>ignorance</b> play into institutional treatment of various parties or how governments practice ignorance towards actors’ financial activities...|$|R

40|$|In {{knowledge-based}} economies, {{how can the}} epistemic {{dynamics of}} academic research be understood {{in the context of}} collaborative research networks where knowledge production and use increasingly merge? My starting point is a potential epistemic blind spot in knowledge mobilization research on merging production and use dynamics: ignorance. I propose a new concept, ignorance mobilization, defined as the use <b>of</b> <b>ignorance</b> towards the achievement of goals. From the role <b>of</b> <b>ignorance</b> in research and innovation, to an understanding <b>of</b> epistemic (<b>ignorance</b> and knowledge) mobilization, I develop an interactive model of network epistemic mobilization. The model frames epistemic dynamics in collaborative research networks with production and use contexts. My main argument is that symmetrical social epistemology research can help understand the distinct and dynamic role <b>of</b> <b>ignorance</b> alongside knowledge in research and innovation. I draw from scholarship on the integration of academic research in knowledge-based economies, knowledge mobilization concepts and theory, sociology of knowledge and sociology <b>of</b> <b>ignorance</b> epistemic categories <b>of</b> <b>ignorance</b> and knowledge and their dynamics in research and innovation, and Simmelian and Weberian theories of action.
