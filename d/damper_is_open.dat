5000|$|In one design, {{the motor}} {{is often a}} small {{shaded-pole}} synchronous motor combined with a rotary switch that can disconnect the motor at {{either of the two}} stopping points ("damper open" [...] or [...] "damper closed"). In this way, applying power to the [...] "open damper" [...] terminal causes the motor to run until the <b>damper</b> <b>is</b> <b>open</b> while applying power at the [...] "close damper" [...] terminal causes the motor to run until the damper is closed. The motor is commonly powered from the same 24 volt AC power source that is used {{for the rest of the}} control system. This allows the zone dampers to be directly controlled by low-voltage thermostats and wired with low-voltage wiring. Because simultaneous closure of all dampers might harm the furnace or air handler, this style of damper is often designed to only obstruct a portion of the air duct, for example, 75%.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} a two step Computational Model Updating method is investigated. In the first step, {{physical}} mass and stiffness parameters are updated. In the second step, the modal damping parameters {{as well as}} physical damping parameters (allowing to update global non-proportional <b>damping)</b> <b>are</b> <b>open</b> for updating. The updating techniques are based on the inverse sensitivity approach and use frequency response data only at the resonance peaks. The optimization process is solved by minimizing an objective function containing two residuals. The first represents the differences between the analytical and the experimental resonance peaks utilizing the fact, that the analytical and the experimental FRF peaks occur at different resonace frequencies. The decision on what test/analysis FRF peak differences to include in the objective function is based on the Frequency Domain Assurance Criterion (FDAC). The resonances must not necessarily be identical with the eigenfrequencies since they are determined by more or less rough estimates of the eigenfrequencies using a mode indicator function...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{style of}} {{electrically}} powered damper uses a spring-return mechanism and a shaded-pole synchronous motor. In this case, the <b>damper</b> <b>is</b> normally <b>opened</b> {{by the force}} of the spring but can be closed {{by the force of}} the motor. Removal of electrical power re-opens the damper. This style of <b>damper</b> <b>is</b> advantageous because it is [...] "fail safe"; if the control to the damper fails, the damper opens and allows air to flow. However, in most applications [...] "fail safe" [...] indicates the damper will close upon loss of power thus preventing the spread of smoke and fire to other areas. These dampers also may allow adjustment of the [...] "closed" [...] position so that they only obstruct, for example, 75% of the air flow when closed.|$|R

40|$|An air {{conditioning}} system economizer, investigated in this thesis, consisted of three dampers, an outdoor air, a recirculation, and a discharge damper. The purpose of an economizer is to control {{the ratio of the}} outdoor air flow rate to the recirculation air flow rate. The dampers were opposed blade type and had equal sizes. They were coupled through a control system. Two control strategies were investigated. In the first strategy, the three economizer dampers were coupled so that the outdoor air and discharge damper open as the recirculation damper closes. In a second strategy, the discharge <b>damper</b> <b>was</b> always <b>open</b> during operation and the outdoor air and recirculation dampers were coupled so that the outdoor air damper opens as the recirculation damper closes. The two coupled dampers control strategy will require slightly less power than three coupled damper strategy. The study showed that the linearization of throat area versus control signal is the most important factor for reducing power, whether the three coupled it is or two coupled dampers control strategy is used. linearization provides good control of the air flow rates, from 0 % to 95 %.

40|$|In this study, the {{accuracy}} of CSD (Comprehensive Structural Dynamics) analysis on the evaluation of blade aeroelastic responses and structural loads of HART(Higher harmonic Aeroacoustic Rotor Test) II baseline rotor is assessed using a comprehensive rotorcraft dynamics code, CAMRAD II, and a nonlinear flexible multi-body dynamics analysis code, DYMORE. Considering insufficient measurement data for HART II rotor, prescribed airloads computed by a three-dimensional compressible flow solver KFLOW are used to replace the lifting-line airloads and thereby enhance the prediction capability of the comprehensive analyses. The CSD results on blade elastic deflections using the prescribed airloads indicate more oscillatory behavior than those by lifting-line based approaches, but the wave pattern becomes improved by including artificial damping into the rotor system. It is demonstrated that the structural load predictions are improved significantly by the prescribed airloads approach against the measured data, as compared with an isolated CSD analysis Key words: HART II rotor, comprehensive code, prescribed airloads, artificial <b>damping</b> This <b>is</b> an <b>Open</b> Access article distributed {{under the terms of}} the Creative Com...|$|R
