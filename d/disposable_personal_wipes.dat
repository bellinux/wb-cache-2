A simple “Bread and Peace ” model {{shows that}} {{aggregate}} votes for President in postwar elections were determined entirely by weighted-average growth of real <b>disposable</b> <b>personal</b> income per capita during the incumbent party’s term and the cumulative numbers of American military personnel {{killed in action}} {{as a result of}} U.

Not one of these variations adds value to the Bread and Peace model or significantly perturbs its coefficients. 1. The Bread and Peace model Postwar American presidential elections should for the most part be viewed as a sequence of referendums on the White House party’s economic record. In fact, aside from the 1952 and 1968 contests when U. S. military involvement in the Korean and Vietnamese civil wars, respectively, most likely deprived the Democrats of victory, growth of real <b>disposable</b> <b>personal</b> income per capita during the presidential term accounts, all by itself, for over 90 % of th...|$|R
40|$|Private {{consumption}} {{represents an}} important component of aggregate demand, i. e. private consumption becomes a significant aspect of GDP determination. The objective {{of this paper is to}} examine private consumption in terms of a potential short-run influence of advertising on private consumption as one of the factors that determine consumption. GDP (<b>disposable</b> <b>personal</b> income), interest rates, but also advertising may be considered as important factors that can accelerate the development or change the direction of development of private consumption. A debate on effects of these factors is carried on in the paper. Determinants of advertising expenses as well as potential influence of advertising on private consumption will be studied. This general theme will be specified under conditions of American economy and examined during a period of almost 80 years (1929 – 2008). The GLS method of estimation with application of Cochrane-Orcutt regression is used. Despite of lower statistical significance the model indicates that advertising expenses variable is not an important variable of private consumption at aggregate level on the contrary to <b>disposable</b> <b>personal</b> income and private savings...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} US <b>disposable</b> <b>personal</b> income (DPI) and house price index (HPI) during {{the last twenty years}} applying fractional integration and long-range dependence techniques to monthly data from January 1991 to July 2010. The empirical findings indicate that the stochastic properties of the two series are such that cointegration cannot hold between them, as mean reversion occurs in the case of DPI but not of HPI. Also, recursive analysis shows that the estimated fractional parameter is relatively stable over time for DPI whilst it increases throughout the sample for HPI. Interestingly, the estimates tend to converge toward the unit root case after 2008 once the bubble had burst. The implications for explaining the recent financial crisis and choosing appropriate policy actions are discussed. <b>personal</b> <b>disposable</b> income, house price index, fractional integration...|$|R

Through 2015, NEI has awarded 259 grants worth $ 96. 2 million to more than a dozen grantee organizations that are primarily focused on fostering entrepreneurship and early stage business in Southeast Michigan. These grantees provide a variety of services to local businesses and the entrepreneurial community, including access to capital, idea competitions, entrepreneurial networking, training programs and identification of best practices, and investments in neighborhoods and buildings that facilitate entrepreneurship. Overall, Southeast Michigan companies that benefited from NEI support generated $ 2. 9 billion in inflation-adjusted (or "real") output, $ 1. 9 billion in Detroit-area real gross domestic product (GDP), $ 1. 1 billion in real wages and salaries, and $ 1. 1 billion in <b>disposable</b> <b>personal</b> income over the period 2008 to 2015.

50|$|Although {{national}} income per capita {{rose in the}} first third of the 1950s, {{the standard of living}} fell. Huge income deductions to finance industrial investment reduced <b>disposable</b> <b>personal</b> income; mismanagement created chronic shortages in basic foodstuffs resulting in rationing of bread, sugar, flour, and meat. Compulsory subscriptions to state bonds further reduced personal income. The net result was that disposable real income of workers and employees in 1952 was only two-thirds of what it had been in 1938, whereas in 1949, the proportion had been 90%. These policies had a cumulative negative effect and fueled discontent as foreign debt grew and the population experienced shortages of goods.|$|R
