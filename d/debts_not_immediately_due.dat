50|$|Abubakar III (1996-1998) was {{appointed}} in 1996, but engaged throughout his term in legal battles with his predecessor. After his death, {{the office was}} again <b>not</b> filled <b>immediately</b> <b>due</b> to the ongoing legal challenges by Etsu Muhammadu Attahiru.|$|R
50|$|The broad arrow {{statutes}} were <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> enforced, <b>due</b> to England {{having access}} to other sources of timber in the Baltic. However, when this source diminished, additional broad arrow policies acts were passed and enforcement increased in North America.|$|R
50|$|In 1962, {{the design}} {{phase of the}} {{building}} started, supported by the Gdańsk University of Technology. The investment was planned in two steps, the first one from 1966 to 1971, the second stage after 1972. Contrary to expectations, construction did <b>not</b> start <b>immediately,</b> <b>due</b> to the delaying design work.|$|R

50|$|British Rail class D3/12 was a {{class of}} three {{experimental}} diesel-electric shunting locomotives designed by Richard Maunsell of the Southern Railway in 1937.

500|$|Washington's loss at Philadelphia {{prompted}} {{some members}} of Congress to consider removing Washington from command. This movement termed the Conway Cabal, failed after Washington's supporters rallied behind him. Biographer Alden relates, [...] "it was inevitable that the defeats of Washington's forces and the concurrent victory of the forces in upper New York should be compared." [...] The zealous admiration of Washington indeed inevitably waned. John Adams was never {{a fan of the}} southern delegation to the Continental Congress, and he wrote that [...] "Congress will appoint a thanksgiving; and one cause of it ought to be that the glory of turning the tide of arms is <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> <b>due</b> to the commander-in-chief nor to southern troops. If it had been, idolatry and adulation would have been unbounded.... Now we can allow a certain citizen to be wise, virtuous, and good, without thinking him a deity or a savior." ...|$|R
50|$|The MRT-3 {{consortium}} {{composed of}} Fil-Estate Holdings and Ayala Land {{decided to make}} the depot underground rather than a regular depot similar to LRT-1 due to its commercial viability as a shopping mall. When the MRT-3 began operations on December 1999, the construction of the mall was <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> undertaken <b>due</b> to lack of funding. The North Triangle Depot Commercial Corporation was incorporated in 2001 with Fil-Estate spearheading the development and Ayala Land as minority stockholder.|$|R
50|$|In September 1944 it was {{announced}} that the club would reopen under the lease of Harold Jacobs and Julius Yablok; in December 1944, Café Society nightclub owner Barney Josephson was said to be interested in assuming the lease. In March 1945, theatrical producer George H.

By 1946, the Riobamba had been replaced by the Embassy Club.|$|R
50|$|The {{community}} initially {{approached the}} Apostolic Nuncio to petition for the Canonical Coronation of the image. The canonical coronation was <b>not</b> granted <b>immediately</b> <b>due</b> {{to lack of}} background research and testimonies about the miracles attributed to Our Lady.

50|$|Greaux {{and several}} other investors formed Windward Islands Airways in 1961, which offered service to Saba. Regular air service to Saba did <b>not</b> begin <b>immediately</b> <b>due</b> {{to the need for}} a short takeoff and landing (STOL) {{aircraft}} and the small number of people who could afford a ticket. In 1965 the airport went unused for six months. For a while the island was serviced by a 6-passenger Dornier aircraft (possibly a Dornier Do 28), but service picked up when Windward Islands Airways began flying de Havilland Twin Otters in 1965.|$|R

50|$|Prior to the 1980s, most {{recording}} studios used analog multitrack recorders, typically {{based on}} reel-to-reel tape. The first commercial recording system was the Sample-to-Disk 16-bit, 50 kHz digital recording {{option for the}} New England Digital Synclavier II in 1982. The high cost and limited capacity of these solutions limited their use to large professional audio recording studios, and even then, they were usually reserved for specific applications such as film post-production. Stereo audio was <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> available <b>due</b> to data input and output limitations on hard drives of that time.|$|R

State Route 62, which crosses the Banning and Mission Creek Faults, was <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> reopened <b>due</b> to buckled pavement. The California Aqueduct was damaged at several locations and water had to be diverted into a lake bed, and up to 80,000 people lost power {{for a portion of}} the day.

50|$|As Russia’s war losses {{increased}} so did anti-German hysteria. They {{were made}} {{responsible for the}} disastrous {{course of the war}} and were accused of being spies and saboteurs betraying Russia. Anti-German measures reached a nadir with the government’s so-called Liquidation Laws, of February 1915, to expropriate German properties in the Western border provinces, especially in Volhynia. Compensation was envisaged in the form of 25 year government obligations. The laws were <b>not</b> enforced <b>immediately</b> <b>due</b> to the concern over economic disruption. The presence of the decrees, however, caused great anxiety in many German villages, particularly in the province of Volhynia, resulting in panic sales or neglect of the land expected to be expropriated at any moment.|$|R
40|$|The Maskin's theorem on Nash {{implementation}} is {{a fundamental}} work {{in the theory of}} mechanism design. A recent work [Wu, Quantum mechanism helps agents combat ``bad'' social choice rules. Intl.

Although quantum mechanisms are theoretically feasible, they are <b>not</b> applicable <b>immediately</b> <b>due</b> to the restriction of current experimental technologies. In this paper, we will go beyond the obstacle of how to realize quantum mechanisms, and propose an algorithmic mechanism which amends the sufficient conditions of the Maskin's theorem immediately just in the macro world (i. e., computer or Internet world). ...|$|R

50|$|Turbocharging {{allows for}} more {{efficient}} engine operation {{because it is}} driven by exhaust pressure {{that would otherwise be}} (mostly) wasted, but there is a design limitation known as turbo lag. The increased engine power is <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> available <b>due</b> to the need to sharply increase engine RPM, to build up pressure and to spin up the turbo, before the turbo starts to do any useful air compression. The increased intake volume causes increased exhaust and spins the turbo faster, and so forth until steady high power operation is reached. Another difficulty is that the higher exhaust pressure causes the exhaust gas to transfer more of its heat to the mechanical parts of the engine.|$|R

30|$|As we know now, {{history has}} proven otherwise. The demise of Lehman has pushed {{the world economy}} in a deep recession, {{of which it is}} still trying to recover. The {{subsequent}} euro-crisis has reinforced the problems. Many European countries are now struggling to get their economy growing and their deficit under control. However, there are striking differences within Europe. The GIPSI countries with limited access to financial markets face massive losses in GDP. The Netherlands does not have problems to finance its sovereign debt. Nevertheless, its economy lost 6 % output relative to Germany between 2008 and 2014. This paper offers an explanation for this phenomenon, which provides broader lessons for the mechanisms at work in economies hit by a financial crisis. Since financing its public <b>debt</b> was <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> at risk, the Netherlands is an ideal laboratory for these mechanisms. These lessons might then be helpful in avoiding financial stress {{in the first place and}} for the proper design of the European framework for budgetary oversight in the second place.|$|R

It was <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> replaced <b>due</b> to strong sentiments on campus against the Vietnam War. Eventually, {{after the end of the}} war in 1977, students lobbied for its return.
