50|$|Each {{paralleling}} station bus {{is connected}} to both north and south track catenary and feeder lines via <b>automatic</b> <b>circuit</b> breakers. The autotransformer {{is connected to}} the bus bars by an additional circuit breaker. The track breakers at the paralleling stations trip on sensing no-voltage. Thus when a line fault causes the supplying substation breakers to trip, the paralleling stations also trip. This action separates the two tracks from one another electrically and allows the substation to automatically restore one of the tracks (the non-faulted one). After a variable time delay (to reduce simultaneous inrush current), over-voltage relays will re-shut the track circuit breakers on the non-faulted track.|$|R
