50|$|The thalamocortical loop {{starts with}} oscillatory thalamic cells. These cells receive both sensory {{input from the}} body as well as input from {{feedback}} pathways in the brain. In a sense, these cells serve to integrate these multiple inputs by changing their inherent oscillatory properties in response to depolarization by these many different inputs. TC neurons exhibit <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillation</b> when depolarized to greater than -45 mV, {{and the frequency of}} oscillation is related to the degree of depolarization. This oscillation is caused by the activation of leaky P/Q-type calcium channels found in the dendrites of the cells. Because of the leaky channel properties, spontaneous, inherent oscillation can also occur independent of any rhythmic input as well, though the ramifications of this capability are not entirely known and may add nothing but background noise to the thalamocortical loop.|$|E
40|$|<b>Gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> of the {{electromagnetic}} field of the brain {{are known to be}} involved in a variety of cognitive processes, and are believed to be fundamental for information processing within the brain. While <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> {{have been shown to be}} correlated with brain rhythms at different frequencies, to date no empirical evidence has been presented that supports a causal influence of <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> on other brain rhythms. In this work, we study the relation of <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> and the sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) in healthy human subjects using electroencephalography. We first demonstrate that modulation of the SMR, induced by motor imagery of either the left or right hand, is positively correlated with the power of frontal and occipital <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations,</b> and negatively correlated with the power of centro-parietal <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations.</b> We then demonstrate that the most simple causal structure, capable of explaining the observed correlation of <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> and the SMR, entails a causal influence of <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> on the SMR. This finding supports the fundamental role attributed to <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> for information processing within the brain, and is of particular importance for brain–computer interfaces (BCIs). As modulation of the SMR is typically used in BCIs to infer a subject's intention, our findings entail that <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> have a causal influence on a subject's capability to utilize a BCI for means of communication...|$|R

Adenosine receptor modulation has been shown to alter cognitive function in animals and humans. In this thesis the effects of adenosine receptor modulation on in vitro and in vivo hippocampal <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> were investigated as well as the underlying mechanisms. A_ 1 -receptor activation selectively decreased <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> while blocking A_ 1 -receptors and activating A_ 2 A-receptors increased <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations.</b> Increasing endogenous adenosine levels suppressed <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> while decreasing endogenous adenosine levels facilitated <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> in vitro. Sharp electrode current clamp and whole-cell voltage clamp experiments showed that A_ 1 -receptor activation hyperpolarised resting membrane potential, reduced firing rate and EPSP amplitude and shifted the IPSC reversal potential to more negative potentials. Blocking A_ 1 -receptors increased pyramidal cell excitability and increased excitatory synaptic transmission. The results in vivo were more ambiguous but A_ 1 -receptor activation decreased power in all frequency bands indicating that adenosine receptors can modulate hippocampal <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> in vivo. A_ 1 -receptor blockage had no consistent effect on in vivo hippocampal <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations.</b> Adenosine receptors modulate <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> in rodent hippocampal slices but are difficult targets for developing treatments that have cognitive benefits because of their ambiguous effects in vivo.

40|$|<b>Gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> (30 - 100 Hz) {{reflect a}} fast brain rhythm that {{provides}} a fundamental mechanism of complex neuronal information processing in the hippocampus and in the neocortex in vivo. <b>Gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> have been implicated in higher brain functions, such as sensory perception, motor activity, and memory formation. Experimental studies on synaptic transmission and bioenergetics underlying <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> have primarily used acute slices of the hippocampus. This study tests whether organotypic hippocampal slice cultures of the rat provide an alternative model for cortical <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> in vitro. Our findings are that 1) slice cultures feature well-preserved laminated architecture and neuronal morphology; 2) slice cultures of different maturation stages (7 - 28 days in vitro) reliably express <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> at about 40 Hz as induced by cholinergic (acetylcholine) or glutamatergic (kainate) receptor agonists; 3) the peak frequency of <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> depends on the temperature, with an increase of ∼ 3. 5 Hz per degree Celsius for the range of 28 - 36 °C; 4) most slice cultures show persistent <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> for ∼ 1 hr during electrophysiological local field potential recordings, and later alterations may occur; and 5) in slice cultures, glucose at a concentration of 5 mM in the recording solution is sufficient to power <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations,</b> and additional energy substrate supply with monocarboxylate metabolite lactate (2 mM) exclusively increases the peak frequency by ∼ 4 Hz.

Here, we examine the generation of <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillation</b> currents in the hippocampus, using two-dimensional, 96 -site silicon probes. Two gamma generators were identified, one in the dentate gyrus and another in the CA 3 -CA 1 regions. The coupling strength between the two oscillators varied during both theta and nontheta states. Both pyramidal cells and interneurons were phase-locked to gamma waves. Anatomical connectivity, rather than physical distance, determined the coupling strength of the oscillating neurons. CA 3 pyramidal neurons discharged CA 3 and CA 1 interneurons at latencies indicative of monosynaptic connections.

40|$|In {{this present}} work {{stimulation}} paradigms, {{that are known}} to induce long term potentiation, were used to induce sharp wave ripple complexes (SPW-R), {{which are based on}} successive discharge of hippocampal neurons. Those SPW-R complexes are similar in their characteristics to spontaneously occurring SPW-R: they primarily originate in the subregion CA 3 and propagate via CA 1 to the subiculum. The induction is essentially dependant on the activation of NMDA receptors, while AMPA/kainate receptors are crucial for their maintenance. Once induced the blockage of NMDA receptors no longer lead to an interruption of SPW-R; the excitation through AMPA/kainate receptors is sufficient for their maintenance. In contrast to high-frequency stimulation a series of low-frequency stimulation leads to long-term depression and to the collapse of SPW-R complexes. On an intracellular level the SPW-R complexes are characterized by a dynamic reorganization of neuronal networks, which can recruit or exclude cells into the network. Under the influence of the GABA A receptor antagonist bicuculline previously induced SPW-R complexes are transformed into a prolonged discharge with considerably higher amplitude. The frequency content of the ripples corresponds to about 300 Hz. During a SPW-R complex intracellular recordings of pyramidal cells show a substantially stronger and prolonged depolarisation with up to 40 spikes as an expression of lack of inhibition. Overall those characteristics resemble of recurrent epiletiform discharges (RED), which have already been shown in humans and rats. In further experiments the influence of serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine on tetanically as well as on carbachol or kainate induced <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillation</b> was examined. The pharmacological induced <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillation</b> was suppressed dose dependently in all tested monoamines and the frequency content was shifted to slightly higher frequencies. This effect is simulated by isoprotenerol in tetanically and pharmacologically induced <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillation</b> likewise, a finding that hints to a mechanistic correlation with intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate. However tetantically induced oscillations are augmented under the influence of monoamines. These results indicate the participation of other types of cells during tetanically induced <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillation</b> compared to pharmacological induction...|$|E

In the present study, we analyzed <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> of pulvinar neurons in the monkeys during a delayed non-matching to sample task, in which monkeys were required to discriminate 4 categories of visual stimuli (snakes, monkey faces, monkey hands and simple geometrical patterns). <b>Gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> of pulvinar neuronal activity were analyzed in three phases around the stimulus onset (Pre-stimulus: 500 [*]ms before stimulus onset; Early: 0 – 200 [*]ms after stimulus onset; and Late: 300 – 500 [*]ms after stimulus onset). The results showed significant increases in mean strength of <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> in the Early phase for snakes and the Late phase for monkey faces, but no significant differences in ratios and frequencies of <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> among the 3 phases.

40|$|We {{studied the}} existence, {{localization}} and attentional modulation of gamma-band oscillatory activity (30 [...] 130 Hz) {{in the human}} intracranial region. Two areas known to {{play a key role}} in visual object processing: the lateral occipital (LO) cortex and the fusiform gyrus. These areas consistently displayed large <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> during visual stimulus encoding, while other extrastriate areas remained systematically silent, across 14 patients and 291 recording sites scattered throughout extrastriate visual cortex. The lateral extent of the responsive regions was small, in the range of 5 mm. Induced <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> and evoked potentials were not systematically co-localized. LO and the fusiform gyrus displayed markedly different patterns of attentional modulation. In the fusiform gyrus, attention enhanced stimulus-driven <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations.</b> In LO, attention increased the baseline level of <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> during the expectation period preceding the stimulus. Subsequent <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> produced by attended stimuli were smaller than those produced by unattended, irrelevant stimuli. Attentional modulations of <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> in LO and the fusiform gyrus were thus very different, both in their time-course (preparatory period and/or stimulus processing) and direction of modulation (increase or decrease).

Evidence suggests that interneurons known as basket cells are responsible for the generation of <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations.</b> However, current models of <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> lack the dynamic short term synaptic plasticity seen at basket cell-basket cell synapses as well as the large autaptic synapses basket cells are known to express. Hence, I sought to extend the Wang-Buzsáki model of <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> to include these features. I found that autapses increased the synchrony of basket cell membrane potentials across the network during neocortical <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> as well as allowed the network to oscillate over a broader range of depolarizing drive. I also found that including realistic synaptic depression filtered the output of the network.

We show that the initiation of kainate-evoked gamma oscillations induces mitochondrial depolarization, indicating a metabolic response. Aging had an opposite effect on these parameters: while depressing the <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillation</b> strength, it increases mitochondrial depolarization. Also, in the aged neurons, kainate induced significantly larger Ca 2 + signals.

Among other events {{involved in the}} addiction cycle, the study of a single exposure to cocaine, and {{the contribution of the}} effects of that event to the continuous and further use of drugs of abuse are fundamental. Gamma oscillations are thought to be important neural correlates of cognitive processing in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) which include decision making, set shifting and working memory. It follows that cocaine exposure might modulate gamma oscillations, which could result in reduced cognitive ability. Parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking interneurons play an orchestrating role in <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillation</b> induction and it has been shown recently that gamma oscillations can be induced in an anesthetized animal using optogenetic techniques. We use a knock-in mouse model together with optogenetics and in vivo electrophysiology to study the effects of acute cocaine on PFC <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillation</b> as a step toward understanding the cortical changes that may underlie continuous use of stimulants. Our results show that acute cocaine administration increases entrainment of the <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillation</b> to the optogentically induced driving frequency.

40|$|Although {{intracranial}} electroencephalography (iEEG) {{has been}} widely used to localize epileptogenic zones in epilepsy, visual inspection of iEEG recordings does not always result in a favorable surgical outcome, especially in secondary generalized epilepsy such as Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (LGS).

In this study, we investigated whether the iEEG-based frequency domain source imaging of high <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillation</b> (60 – 100 Hz) would be a useful supplementary tool for identifying epileptogenic zones in patients with secondary generalized epilepsy. The method was applied to three successfully operated on LGS patients, whose iEEG contained some ictal events with distinct high gamma oscillations before seizure onset. The resultant cortical source distributions were compared with surgical resection areas and with high gamma spectral power distributions on the intracranial sensor plane. While the results of the sensor-level analyses contained many spurious activities, the results of frequency domain source imaging coincided better with the surgical resection areas, suggesting that the frequency domain source imaging of iEEG high gamma oscillations might help enhance the accuracy of pre-surgical evaluations of patients with secondary generalized epilepsy...|$|E

40|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} olfactory bulb (OB) dynamics is {{the expression of}} characteristic local field potential (LFP) rhythms, including a slow respiration-related rhythm and two fast alternating oscillatory rhythms, beta (15 - 30 Hz) and gamma (40 - 90 Hz). All of these rhythms are implicated in olfactory coding. Fast oscillatory rhythms are known to involve the mitral-granule cell loops. Although the underlying mechanisms of <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillation</b> have been studied, the origin of beta oscillation remains poorly understood. Whether these two different rhythms share the same underlying mechanism is unknown. This study uses a quantitative and detailed current-source density analysis combined with multi-unit activity recordings {{to shed light on}} this question in freely breathing anesthetized rats. In particular, we show that <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillation</b> generation involves mainly upper half of the external plexiform layer (EPL) and superficial areas of granule cell layer. In contrast, the generation of beta oscillation involves {{the lower part of the}} EPL and deep granule cells.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{mystery in}} neuroscience is how cellular components endow a particular anatomical region {{with a specific}} function. In the hippocampus, this function appears to be episodic memory. Here we examine how networks of pyramidal cells in the CA 3 region, when regulated by cholinergic neuromodulation, theta- and gamma-frequency oscillations, and different classes of inhibitory interneurons can support memory function analogous to that of artificial attractor neural networks. This is a computational investigation of highly detailed, biophysical-level models of pyramidal cells and interneurons {{with a wide variety}} of intrinsic ion channels (Na, CaL, CaN, CaT, KDR, KM, KA, KAHP and KC), connected in networks by AMPA-, NMDA- and GABAA-mediated synapses consistent with specific anatomy, physiology and pharmacology of CA 3. At the level of single cells, the major findings are that the modulation of ion channels by increasing concentrations of acetylcholine (ACh) promotes a striking transition from bursting to regular spiking, increases the amplitude and speed of backpropagating action potentials, and decreases intracellular free calcium in the dendritic arbor. At the network level, we find that ACh regulates the frequency of the <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillation</b> in a concentration-dependent manner while its ability to alter the balance of AMPA- and NMDA-mediated synaptic currents can tune the network for optimal memory performance. The CA 3 model is capable of robust autoassociative memory function and suggests putative roles for cholinergic neuromodulation, oscillations and interneurons in memory function. Cholinergic input is proposed to regulate the behavioral state of the network (bursting vs. spiking, learning vs. recall), the theta oscillation clocks inputs from entorhinal cortex, the <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillation</b> maintains rapid and temporally-precise coding of information, and different classes of interneurons generate gamma-band oscillations and balance the excitation of the pyramidal cell recurrent collaterals. Finally, simulations of cholinergic denervation and/or modulation by the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) have implications for the cognitive decline that accompanies Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease. Specifically, the observed slowing of the <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillation</b> is a novel and experimentally testable effect that his a significant impact on memory performance; the modulation of potassium channels by Aβ prevents the transition from a regular spiking to a bursting regime interfering with the switch between learning and recall. ...|$|E

40|$|Cortical <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> are {{associated}} with cognitive processes and are altered in several neuropsychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s disease. Since dopamine D 3 receptors are possible targets in treatment of these conditions, it is of great importance to understand their role in modulation of <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations.</b> The effect of D 3 receptors on <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> and the underlying cellular mechanisms were investigated by extracellular local field potential and simultaneous intracellular sharp micro-electrode recordings in the CA 3 region of the hippocampus in vitro. D 3 receptors decreased the power and broadened the bandwidth of <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> induced by acetylcholine or kainate. Blockade of the D 3 receptors resulted in faster synchronization of the oscillations, suggesting that endogenous dopamine in the hippocampus slows down the dynamics of <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> by activation of D 3 receptors. Investigating the underlying cellular mechanisms for these effects showed that D 3 receptor activation decreased the rate of action potentials during <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> and reduced the precision of the action potential phase coupling to the gamma cycle in CA 3 pyramidal cells. The results may offer an explanation how selective activation of D 3 receptors may impair cognition and how, in converse, D 3 antagonists may exert pro-cognitive and antipsychotic effects...|$|R
40|$|<b>Gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> are a {{prominent}} feature of hippocampal network activity, but their functional role remains debated, ranging from mere epiphenomena to being crucial for information processing. Similarly, persistent <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> sometimes appear prior to epileptic discharges {{in patients with}} mesial temporal sclerosis. However, {{the significance of this}} activity in hippocampal excitotoxicity is unclear. We assessed the relationship between kainic acid (KA) -induced <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> and excitotoxicity in genetically engineered mice in which N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor deletion was confined to CA 3 pyramidal cells. Mutants showed reduced CA 3 pyramidal cell firing and augmented sharp wave–ripple activity, resulting in higher susceptibility to KA-induced seizures, and leading to strikingly selective neurodegeneration in the CA 1 subfield. Interestingly, the increase in KA-induced γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels, and the persistent 30 – 50 -Hz <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations,</b> both of which were observed in control mice prior to the first seizure discharge, were abolished in the mutants. Consequently, on subsequent days, mutants manifested prolonged epileptiform activity and massive neurodegeneration of CA 1 cells, including local GABAergic neurons. Remarkably, pretreatment with the potassium channel blocker α-dendrotoxin increased GABA levels, restored <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations,</b> and prevented CA 1 degeneration in the mutants. These results demonstrate that the emergence of low-frequency <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> predicts increased resistance to KA-induced excitotoxicity, raising the possibility that <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> may have potential prognostic value in the treatment of epilepsy.

40|$|Functional imaging of {{the human}} brain is an {{increasingly}} important technique for clinical and cognitive neuroscience research, with functional MRI (fMRI) of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response and electroencephalography or magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings of neural oscillations being 2 of the most popular approaches. However, the neural and physiological mechanisms that generate these responses are only partially understood and sources of interparticipant variability in these measures are rarely investigated. Here, we test the hypothesis that the properties of these neuroimaging metrics are related to individual levels of cortical inhibition by combining magnetic resonance spectroscopy to quantify resting GABA concentration in the visual cortex, MEG to measure stimulus-induced visual gamma oscillations and fMRI to measure the BOLD response to a simple visual grating stimulus. Our results demonstrate that across individuals <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillation</b> frequency is positively correlated with resting GABA concentration in visual cortex (R = 0. 68; P < 0. 02), BOLD magnitude is inversely correlated with resting GABA (R = - 0. 64; P < 0. 05) and that <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillation</b> frequency is strongly inversely correlated with the magnitude of the BOLD response (R = - 0. 88; P < 0. 001). Our results are therefore supportive of recent theories suggesting that these functional neuroimaging metrics are dependent on the excitation/inhibition balance in an individual's cortex and have important implications for the interpretation of functional imaging results, particularly when making between-group comparisons in clinical research...|$|E
40|$|Local field {{potential}} (LFP) oscillations are {{often accompanied by}} synchronization of activity within a widespread cerebral area. Thus, the LFP and neuronal coherence {{appear to be the}} result of a common mechanism that underlies neuronal assembly formation. We used the olfactory bulb as a model to investigate: (1) the extent to which unitary dynamics and LFP oscillations can be correlated and (2) the precision with which a model of the hypothesized underlying mechanisms can accurately explain the experimental data. For this purpose, we analyzed simultaneous recordings of mitral cell (MC) activity and LFPs in anesthetized and freely breathing rats in response to odorant stimulation. Spike trains were found to be phase-locked to the <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillation</b> at specific firing rates and to form odor-specific temporal patterns. The use of a conductance-based MC model driven by an approximately balanced excitatory-inhibitory input conductance and a relatively small inhibitory conductance that oscillated at the gamma frequency allowed us to provide one explanation of the experimental data via a mode-locking mechanism. This work sheds light on the way network and intrinsic MC properties participate in the locking of MCs to the <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillation</b> in a realistic physiological context and may result in a particular time-locked assembly. Finally, we discuss how a self-synchronization process with such entrainment properties can explain, under experimental conditions: (1) why the gamma bursts emerge transiently with a maximal amplitude position relative to the stimulus time course; (2) why the oscillations are prominent at a specific gamma frequency; and (3) why the oscillatio...|$|E
40|$|Gamma {{oscillations}} {{are thought}} to be critical for a number of behavioural functions, they occur in many regions of the brain and through a variety of mechanisms. Fast repetitive bursting (FRB) neurons in layer 2 of the cortex are able to drive gamma oscillations over long periods of time. Even though the oscillation is driven by FRB neurons, strong feedback within the rest of the cortex must modulate properties of the oscillation such as frequency and power. We used a highly detailed model of the cortex to determine how a cohort of 33 parameters controlling synaptic drive might modulate <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillation</b> properties. We were interested in determining not just the effects of parameters individually, but we also wanted to reveal interactions between parameters beyond additive effects. To prevent a combinatorial explosion in parameter combinations that might need to be simulated, we used a fractional factorial design that estimated the effects of individual parameters and two parameter interactions. This experiment required only 4096 model runs. We found that the largest effects on both gamma power and frequency came from a complex interaction between efficacy of synaptic connections from layer 2 inhibitory neurons to layer 2 excitatory neurons and the parameter for the reciprocal connection. As well as the effect of the individual parameters determining synaptic efficacy, there was multiplicative an interaction between these parameters beyond the additive effects of the parameters alone. The magnitude of this effect was {{similar to that of the}} individual parameters, predicting that it is physiologically important in setting <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillation</b> properties...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Phase-locked <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> {{have so far}} mainly been {{described}} in relation to perceptual processes such as sensation, attention or memory matching. Due to its very short latency (≈ 90 ms) such oscillations are a plausible candidate for very rapid integration of sensory and motor processes. Results We measured EEG in 13 healthy participants in a speeded reaction task. Participants had to press a button {{as fast as possible}} whenever a visual stimulus was presented. The stimulus was always identical and {{did not have to be}} discriminated from other possible stimuli. In trials in which the participants showed a fast response, a slow negative potential over central electrodes starting approximately 800 ms before the response and highly phase-locked <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> over central and posterior electrodes between 90 and 140 ms after the stimulus were observed. In trials in which the participants showed a slow response, no slow negative potential was observed and phase-locked <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> were significantly reduced. Furthermore, for slow response trials the phase-locked <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> were significantly delayed with respect to fast response trials. Conclusion These results indicate the relevance of phase-locked <b>gamma</b> <b>oscillations</b> for very fast (not necessarily detailed) integration processes. </p...|$|R
