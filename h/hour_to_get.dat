500|$|Miami Vice {{received}} particular criticism at {{the difficulty}} of manoeuvring the car. Edward Drury of Computer Gamer, though finding the game to be enjoyable at times, stated that his only dislike was the manoeuvrability of the car, remarking that the game [...] "gets boring" [...] due {{to the amount of}} collisions. Bourne was highly critical of the mechanics of the car, finding it to be [...] "ludicrous" [...] and taking [...] "at least half an <b>hour</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> used to".

The third attack came after [...] and ended up forming the day's main breakaway. De Marchi was joined by Salvatore Puccio (Sky), José Joaquín Rojas (Movistar), Mikaël Cherel (AG2R La Mondiale) and Carlos Quintero (...) [...] Cherel was the best-placed rider on the general classification; he was, however, over an hour down, {{so there was no}} urgent need for the peloton to chase. At the top of the first climb, the five riders had a lead of over eight minutes. This extended to nearly ten minutes following the descent and was still over nine minutes {{at the base of the}} day's final climb. Cherel was the first to attack and Puccio was the first of the riders to be dropped, though he quickly came back to the group. De Marchi pulled the other three riders back to Cherel, whereupon attacks came from Puccio and Rojas. De Marchi dropped Cherel and Quintero, then caught Rojas. With [...] remaining, he passed Puccio and went on to take the stage victory. Puccio finished 21 seconds further back in second place, with Rojas another 11 seconds behind in third.|$|E

2500|$|In January 1800 Galatea escorted {{a convoy}} from Cork through the Channel to the Downs.

At 21:39, the Reich Air Defence Leadership issued an enemy aircraft warning for Dresden, although, at that point, it was thought Leipzig might be the target. At 21:59, the Local Air Raid Leadership confirmed that the bombers were {{in the area of}} Dresden-Pirna. Taylor writes the city was largely undefended; a night fighter force of ten Messerschmitt 110s at Klotzsche airfield was scrambled, but it took them half an <b>hour</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into an attack position.
