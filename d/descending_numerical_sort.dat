In Experiment 2 A, the 2 monkeys who learned the ascending numerical rule ordered pairs of the novel numerosities 5 - 9 on unreintorced trials. The monkey who learned the <b>descending</b> <b>numerical</b> rule failed to extrapolate the descending rule to new numerosities. In Experiment 2 B all 3 monkeys ordered novel exemplars of pairs of the numerosities 5 - 9.

Collectively these studies show that monkeys represent the numerosities 1 - 9 on at least an ordinal scale. It is often assumed that numerical thought is beyond the reach of animals because all human numerical systems use arbitrary symbols, (e. g., Hurford, 1987).

Air pressure passing through the holes of the punch cards triggered an acoustic tone in pipes, strings or bells associated with the holes. Hollerith not only replaced musical notes by numbers. He also combined his punch cards with an electric reading device replacing air pressure: spring-mounted needles made an electrical connection when passing through the holes.

40|$|Multiple {{criteria}} {{decision analysis}} (MCDA) techniques are developed to address challenging classification problems arising in engineering management and elsewhere. MCDA {{consists of a}} set of principles and tools to assist a decision maker (DM) to solve a decision problem with a finite set of alternatives compared according to two or more criteria, which are usually conflicting. The three types of classification problems to which original research contributions are made are Screening: Reduce a large set of alternatives to a smaller set that most likely contains the best choice. Sorting: Arrange the alternatives into a few groups in preference order, so that the DM can manage them more effectively. Nominal classification: Assign alternatives to nominal groups structured by the DM, so that the number of groups, and the characteristics of each group, seem appropriate to the DM. Research on screening is divided into two parts: the design of a sequential screening procedure that is then applied to water resource planning in the Region of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada; {{and the development of a}} case-based distance method for screening that is then demonstrated using a <b>numerical</b> example. <b>Sorting</b> problems are studied extensively under three headings. Case-based distance sorting is carried out with Model I, which is optimized for use with cardinal criteria only, and Model II, which is designed for both cardinal and ordinal criteria; both sorting approaches are applied to a case study in Canadian municipal water usage analysis. Sorting in inventory management is studied using a case-based distance method designed for multiple criteria ABC analysis, and then applied to a case study involving hospital inventory management. Finally sorting is applied to bilateral negotiation using a case-based distance model to assist negotiators that is then demonstrated on a negotiation regarding the supply of bicycle components. A new kind of decision analysis problem, called multiple criteria nominal classification (MCNC), is addressed. Traditional classification methods in MCDA focus on sorting alternatives into groups ordered by preference. MCNC is the classification of alternatives into nominal groups, structured by the DM, who specifies multiple characteristics for each group. The features, definitions and structures of MCNC are presented, emphasizing criterion and alternative flexibility.

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} a computational model, a programming notation, {{and a set}} of programming principles to further and to demonstrate the practicality of programming fine grain concurrent computers. Programs are expressed in the computational model as a collection of definitions of autonomous computing agents called objects. In the execution of a program, the objects communicate data and synchronize their actions exclusively by message-passing. An object executes its definition only in response to receiving a message, and its actions may include sending messages, creating new objects, and modifying its own internal state. The number of actions that occur in response to a message is finite; Turing computability is achieved not within a single object, but through the interaction of objects. A new concurrent programming notation Cantor is used to demonstrate the cognitive process of writing programs using the object model. Programs for <b>numerical</b> sieves, <b>sorting,</b> the eight queens problem, and Gaussian elimination are fully described. Each of these programs involve up to thousands of objects in their exectuion. The general programming strategy is to first partition objects by their overall behavior and then to program the behaviors to be self-organizing. The semantics of Cantor are made precise through the definition of a formal semantics for Cantor and the object model. Objects are modelled as finite automata. The formal semantics is useful for proving program properties and for building frameworks to capture specific properties of object programs. The mathematical frameworks are constructed for building object graphs independently of program execution and for systematically removing objects that are irrelevant to program execution (garbage collection). The formal semantics are complemented by experiments that allow one to study the dynamics of the execution of Cantor programs on fine grain concurrent computers. The clean semantics of Cantor suggests simple metrics for evaluating the execution of concurrent programs for an ideal, abstract implementation. Program performance is also evaluated for environments where computing resources are limited. From the results of these experiments, hardware and software architectures for organizing fine grain message- passing computations is proposed, including support for fault tolerance and for garbage collection...|$|R
40|$|I. Introduction The {{subject of}} {{research}} in this work {{is a process of}} thread unrolling from a bobbin. The mathematical model of this process considering motion of thread peace on a bobbin and unrolled peace is proposed. The dimension of system of differential equations for this model is constant during deploying. The relevance to simulate this process for design of Heliogyro-like solar sails (Heliogyro [1], BMSTU-Sail [2]) is proved. The paper briefly characterizes a blade for such solar sail as a simulation object. It proves the possibility for using a flexible thread model for a long blade because of very small blade thickness (less than 10 μm [3]) relative to blade width and the phenomena of Koriolis forces [4] that lead to buckling failure of blade flatness. The major features of the proposed model are: [...] simulated as a motion of the thread piece both being on a bobbin and its unrolled peace; [...] splitting a thread length into nodes does not depend on the demand to ensure a sufficient number of nodes on a single thread turn on the coil; [...] because of avoiding a problem of contact between the thread and bobbin a stable integration of motion equations is provided by the conventional Runge-Kutta method of fourth order with a constant step [5]; [...] in the course of solution the number of freedom degrees (number of motion equation) is constant, thereby simplifying a calculation algorithm. The closest mathematical model is proposed in [6]. The scientific novelty of this research is the approach to solving the problem of unrolling thread from a bobbin using a constant number of motion equations while preserving real kinematics coiling process. II. Problem formulation In this section the problem of unrolling thread with length L from a bobbin of radius r is posed while any kind of forces are acting on the unrolled peace of thread. Moreover, the law of bobbin rotation φ(t) assumed to be known with the proviso that the model can be modified if φ(t) is the result of solving of ordinary differential equation. III. Mathematical model In this section the detailed description of proposed mathematical model based on conventional spring-mass model is given. The major feature of this model is that on the every integration step all nodes divided into three groups:  nodes on the bobbin (linked) – their motion is completely determined by the bobbin rotation;  free nodes – descended from the bobbin and not neighboring nodes on the bobbin;  boundary nodes - descended from the bobbin neighboring nodes on the bobbin. For each nodes group the right parts of equations of motions are different. In these equations the additional corrections are included that result in reducing the impact of discretization on simulation results. These corrections are:  equations of motion for boundary nodes eliminate unphysical reaction components, resulting from discretization;  when a node descends from the bobbin its velocity vector turns following motion of already descended nodes, thus simulating the thread bending of very small radius at the point of thread <b>descending.</b> IV. <b>Numerical</b> experiment The developed mathematical model is tested using the simplified problem of two-blades rotary solar sail deploying from the «BMSTU-Sail» project [2]. The calculations demonstrated that the proposed mathematical model satisfies the law of conservation of angular momentum. It is also shown that calculation results are almost independent on the utility parameters of mathematical model (e. g. damping coefficient of nodes relative oscillations). V. Conclusion Major conclusions in this paper are:  proposed mathematical model satisfies the law of conservation of angular momentum that indirectly confirms its correctness;  the transverse thread motion is almost independent on the damping and stiffness coefficients, therefore they can be adjusted for calculation stability without accuracy loss;  based on proposed mathematical model of unrolling a thread from a bobbin the improved model of unrolling from a bobbin ought to be developed for more accurate calculations of solar sail deploying. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{study is}} based on 18 months {{intensive}} field-work during which 212 Australasian harriers were trapped, retrapped, measured, sexed, aged, individually marked and observed. Fortnightly observations of the individually marked population were made over a further seven months. The Australasian harrier and European marsh harrier {{are considered to be}} conspecific. Evidence is presented showing that there is no valid reason for considering Circus aeruginosus of the Pacific Islands to be a different subspecies from C. aeruginosus of Australia and New Zealand. During the breeding season ten territories in the 12 km 2 study area averaged 31 ha, nest sites averaged 910 m apart, pairs' overlapping home ranges averaged 9 km. 2 and favourite hunting areas 3 km, 2. A high population density of one bird per 50 ha was calculated. A low fledging success rate of 1. 8 young per successful pair and 1. 1 young per nest site, and two cases of polygyny were recorded during two breeding seasons. Territorial and courtship behaviour, nest parameters and the parental division of labour is described. Seasonal movements and the dispersion of all age and sex classes from the study area {{at the end of the}} breeding season are described. Most (66. 7 %) individually marked adults returned after the autumn dispersal phase and established winter home ranges averaging 9 km. 2. The home range of an adult female in open farmland was calculated to be 14 km 2 using radio-telemetry techniques. A non-breeding season population density of one bird per 80 ha was calculated. Communal roosting, which occurred throughout the year, is discussed. Four hundred and seventy food items were identified in the diet from pellets, prey remains, stomach contents and field observations. In <b>descending</b> order of <b>numerical</b> importance in the diet were mammals (46. 4 %), introduced passerines (29. 0 %), insects (7. 6 %), game birds (6. 7 %), birds' eggs (4. 8 %) and aquatic prey (4. 6 %). Australasian harriers ate significantly greater numbers of live prey than carrion annually. Adults took significantly greater numbers of agile food items than juveniles. Females ate significantly more large (> 200 g) and fewer agile food items than did males. Seven search techniques and five attack techniques, including some buteonine techniques, are identified and described in the Australasian harriers' wide range of hunting techniques. Ninety five attacks on prey are recorded and 15. 8 % of these were successful. Adults were significantly more successful hunters than juveniles. Co-operative hunting, hunting in the daily cycle, feeding behaviour at carrion, interspecific competition for carrion, interspecific disruption of hunting and prey escape tactics are described. From a computer analysis of hunting behaviour data it is concluded that adult males are more manoeuverable and less conspicuous than adult females and juveniles because they flew significantly lower and faster. Adult males also hunted, to a significantly greater degree, those habitats where there were greater numbers of agile prey. The hunting inexperience of juveniles was quantified. The Australasian harrier is moderately sexually dimorphic. Current hypotheses proposed to explain the degree of sexual dimorphism in raptors and why the females of most raptor species are larger than males are critically reviewed...|$|R
