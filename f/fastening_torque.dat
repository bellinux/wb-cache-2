50|$|The term {{is usually}} a misnomer, {{introduced}} mostly by Fender whose guitars traditionally had what is called bolt-on necks. Real bolted joints (i.e., using bolt coupled with a nut) exist—particularly in acoustic guitars—but are less common in electric guitars.

The maker claims this permits a higher <b>fastening</b> <b>torque</b> than ordinary wood screws, and hence a better coupling between neck and body.|$|E

40|$|The {{behaviors}} {{of production and}} relaxation of fastening force in bolted joint for wood construction were experimentally investigated. In the fastening stage, the axial force in bolt and the <b>fastening</b> <b>torque</b> become larger with increasingly fastening the bolt until <b>fastening</b> <b>torque</b> reached at some level. However, the axial force in bolt was hard to increase when fastening the bolt at higher level than that, because of immediate relaxation of axial force in wood members. And in this stage, the compressive strain in wood member was increased at the portion near the washer first, {{and then it was}} distributed {{in the shape of a}} coniform or a fusiform having the tops in both washer sides. The relaxation of axial force in bolt was extremely large in a few minutes after fastening, and the axial force was reduced to about half until 1000 minutes after fastening. Then, the change of axial force in bolt was subjected to the change of relative humidity of circumstance. The relaxation of axial force in bolt developed extremely in the case of initial axial force of above 600 to 800 kgf. Although the axial force in bolt was reduced over 50 percent of initial force, more than 80 percent of compressive strain in wood member was remained even after 1000 minutes after fastening. 木質部材のボルト接合部に関し, ボルト締結時におけるボルト軸カおよび木質部材内のひずみの発現, およびそれらの緩和について実験的にその挙動を明らかにした. (1) ボルト締結時において, ボルトの締付けに伴いボルト軸力および締付けトルクは増大するが, 木質部材では軸力の瞬間的な緩和が大きく, ある一定トルク以上では, 軸力の増加の割合が減少した. (2) ボルト締結時における部材内のひずみは, 座金近傍でのひずみの増大が先行し, その後, 軸力の増加に伴い締付け両端座金を頂点とするような円錐形ないしは紡錘形状に分布し増加する傾向を示した. (3) ボルト軸力は, 締付け直後数分間に大きく減少し, その後, 約 1000 分までの間は周囲の湿度変化の影響が現れず, ほぼ 50 %程度が緩和した. それ以降は, 周囲の湿度変化を受け緩和傾向が乱された. また, 初期軸力のボルト軸力が大きなものほど緩和の程度が大きく, とくに初期軸力 1000 kgfの場合には著しい緩和を示した. 本研究における実験条件の範囲内では, 初期ボルト軸カを 600 ～ 800 kgf に設定するのが最も効果的であると言える. (4) ボルト締結後の部材内のひずみ分布は, ボルトに近い部分での緩和が大きく, ボルトから遠くの位置でのひずみの緩和は小さかった. 周囲湿度の変化による影響は, ひずみの大きいところではそれほど大きくなく, ひずみの小さいところほど影響を受け易かった.

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a study on}} development of a practical and quantitative technique for assessment of the structural health condition by piezoelectric impedance-based technique associated with longitudinal wave propagation method. A truss structure constructed by aluminum beams and piezoelectric patches is investigated experimentally for estimation of the fastening condition of bolts {{which is supposed to}} be a kind of infancy damage. The bolt fastening condition is adjusted by torque wrench. In order to estimate the damage condition numerically, three damage indices, impedance peak frequency shift ΔF, peak amplitude ratio δ and quality factor ratio γ, are proposed in this paper. Furthermore, an assessment method is described for estimation of the damage by using these three damage indices. As an example, estimation of <b>fastening</b> <b>torques</b> on the bolt is illustrated. With a plenty of experiment results, the damage indices proposed in this work are validated useful for assessment not only of the looseness of bolts and also for any other structural infancy damage, such as the concentrated stress, small crack and so on...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aims: In {{response}} to esthetic demand of patients, ceramic abutments have been developed. Despite esthetic of zirconia abutments, machining accuracy of these abutments {{has always been}} a question. Any misfit in the abutment-implant interface connection can lead to detorque and screw loosening. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare torque loss value of manually aided design/manually aided manufacture (MAD/MAM) zirconia abutments with prefabricated titanium abutments. Materials and Methods: Seven titanium abutments (Branemark RP, Easy abutment) and seven copy milled abutments which were duplicated from the prefabricated Zirkonzhan (ZirkonZahn, Sand in Taufers, Italy) were prepared. After sintering process of zirconia abutment, all abutments were <b>fastened</b> with a <b>torque</b> screw under 35 Ncm. Detorque measurements were performed per group pushing the reverse button of the Torque controller soon after screw tightening with values registered. The mean torque loss were calculated and compared using Student's t test. Results: The mean of torque loss was 12. 71 Ncm with standard deviation of 1. 70 for prefabricated titanium abutments and 15. 50 Ncm with standard deviation of 4. 67 for MAD-MAM abutments. The difference between the two groups was not statistically significant (P= 0. 23). Conclusion: Within the limitation of this study, MAD-MAM ceramic abutments could maintain the applied torque comparing to the prefabricated abutments...|$|R
40|$|The screw <b>fastening</b> <b>torque</b> applied during bone {{fracture}} fixation has a decisive influence on subsequent bone healing. Insufficient screw tightness {{can result in}} device/construct instability; conversely, excessive torques risk damaging the bone causing premature fixation failure. This effect is even more prominent in osteoporotic bone, a condition associated annually with almost 9 million fractures worldwide. During fracture fixation, screw tightening torque is applied using subjective feel. This approach may not be optimal for patient"s recovery, increasing risk of fixation failure, particularly in osteoporotic bone, and potentially require revision surgical interventions. Besides bone density, various factors influence the performance of screw fixation. These factors include bone geometry, cortical thickness and time-dependant relaxation behaviour of the bone. If the influence of screw <b>fastening</b> <b>torque</b> on the bone and relationships between these factors was better understood, the surgical technique could be optimised {{to reduce the risk}} of complications. Within this study, we developed an axisymmetric finite element (FE) model of bone screw tightening incorporating viscoelastic behaviour of the cortical bone such as creep and stress relaxation. The model anticipated time-dependent behaviour of the bone for different bone thickness and density after a typical bone fixation screw had been inserted. The idealised model has been developed based on CT scans of bones with varying densities and inserted screws. The model was validated through a series of experiments involving bovine tibiae (4 - 5 months) to evaluate the evolution of surface strains with time (Ncorr v 1. 2). Stress distribution was assessed in photoelastic experiments using acrylic analogues. Relaxation tests have been performed in aqueous environment for up to 48 hours to ensure the relaxation would be complete. The creep behaviour (maximum principal strain) was compared against computational predictions. Our early simulations predicted relaxation strains on the surface of the bone to be 1. 1 % within 24 hours comparing favourably to 1. 3 % measured experimentally. Stress distribution patterns were in agreement with photoelastic results. Using experimentally derived viscoelastic properties, the model has the potential to predict creep and stress relaxation patterns after screw insertion with different fastening torques for bones with varying density and geometry. We aim to develop this into a planning tool providing guidance to surgeons for optimal tightening when using screw fixation, particularly in reduced quality bone...|$|E
30|$|The {{limitation}} {{of the present study}} was the number of samples. We believed the sample number (seven in each group) was sufficient to obtain the trends of microleakage, but it may be better to investigate using large number of samples to analyze the nature of microleakage at the implant–abutment interface in detail. Another limitation was that the <b>fastening</b> <b>torque</b> applied to screw was not necessarily accurate. To mimic clinical situation, we used dedicated beam-type toque wrench delivered from manufacturer. According to the previous studies, the wrench of Nobel Biocare only reportedly demonstrated the target torque value falling within the 95 % confidence interval for the true population mean among four kinds of wrenches [17]. In addition, significantly lower deviations of torque values for beam-type wrenches were reported than for coil and toggle-style wrenches [18]. But toque wrench still has an inaccuracy because the scale printed on the wrench is not fine and it seems to be inappropriate to apply precise torque value. In the present study, we used new torque wrench, but in the clinical settings, variability of toque value may expand because torque wrench is repeatedly used, with sterilization procedure, which decrease the accuracy [19].|$|E
40|$|Surgeons {{generally}} use subjective feel {{to tighten}} bone screws {{as much as}} possible without stripping the threads; however, subsequent fixation failures are common, particularly in osteoporotic bone. We hypothesise that if the preload generated in reduced bone quality and it’s dissipation over time was better understood, then some of these failures could be avoided through the use of more appropriate fastening torques or a different number of screws. This ongoing study aims to develop a validated finite element model capable of predicting the preload generated for different bone densities and cortical thicknesses. To date, experimental tests (n= 10) were conducted using bovine tibiae (4 - 5 months) to evaluate the bone-implant pressure (LLW Prescale Fuji Film) and surface strains (Ncorr v 1. 2, G. I. T.) for a range of tightening torques. The bone density (assessed using CT-images) and cortical thickness of each specimen were recorded. An axisymmetric finite element model was developed based on the experimental tests (Ansys 15. 0). Our early simulations predicted the equivalent strain {{at the edge of the}} implant-bone contact region to be 0. 062 %, which was within the range of the experimentally observed values (0. 04 - 0. 07 %). The predicted bone-implant pressure also compared favorably with a pressure varying between 2. 5 and 0 MPa. Using an experimentally derived relationship between <b>fastening</b> <b>torque</b> and bone-implant pressure, the model has the potential to predict preload for any bone quality. Our intention is to develop this model, in combination with established formulas to calculate stripping torque, into a patient-specific tool providing surgeons with guidance regarding appropriate screw fastening torques for different bone qualities...|$|E
30|$|The occlusal force {{does not}} load {{only on the}} screw. The {{internal}} conical connection interface also helps to transfer and distribute the loading force to the implant [13]. The axial compressive component of occlusal force during oral function causes axial displacement of the abutment to the implant connection, increasing the frictional resistance and screw joint stability of the dental implant [7, 8]. Three factors {{that may lead to}} the axial displacement of the implant-abutment connection are machining tolerance, the wedge effect, and the settling effect. Firstly, machining tolerance is a dimensional variation characteristic of machined components. The precision of every implant component varies during manufacturing due to machining tolerance [14]. Secondly, the wedge effect occurs when tightening torque or loading force is applied to the abutment [15]. The abutment acts as a wedge transferring the axial force directly to the implant. Lastly, the settling effect occurs when rough spots on the contacting surfaces of the connection are flattened under load [16]. It causes the two surfaces to come closer together and leads to axial displacement. This axial displacement causes the length of the abutment screw to shorten, diminishing the screw preload [17]. The settling effect is the main cause of screw loosening. When the abutment is fastened to the implant body with the abutment screw, a settling phenomenon occurs in which the implant body and the abutment are deformed. Even if fastened at 30 [*]N[*]cm, depending on the implant system, the loosening torque becomes smaller than the 7 to 10 % <b>fastening</b> <b>torque.</b> After 5 [*]min from this point, it is necessary to loosen it twice [18]. The degree of settling depends on the surface roughness, surface hardness, and magnitude of the tightening torque and of the occlusal loading force [16]. On the one hand, the settling effect [17] causes the axial displacement leading to the decrease of the screw preload. On the other hand, the axial displacement causes the cone connection surface adaptation providing frictional resistance and screw-joint stability [7, 8].|$|E
40|$|Introduction Osteoporosis is {{the most}} common bone disease, {{contributing}} to over 3. 5 million fragility fractures each year in the EU [1]. Managing these fractures costs € 37 billion each year with a 25 % increase predicted by 2025. Fracture fixation in reduced density osteoporotic bone is a surgical challenge and failures are common, occurring in 15 - 40 % of cases [2]. It is hypothesised that the torque used to fasten bone screws during fracture fixation significantly influences the holding strength of screws and thus the likelihood of fixation failure. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a validated finite element model capable of predicting the effect of different insertion torques on the holding strength of cortical bone screws for a range of bone densities and cortical thicknesses. Methods Experimental tests (n= 100) were conducted to evaluate cortical screw pull-out strength using bovine tibiae (4 - 5 months). The bone density (assessed using CT-images) and cortical thickness of each specimen were recorded. Screws were inserted using a range of insertion torques, and the pullout strength was measured for each (Instron 5967, High Widcomb, UK). Additionally, the effect of stress-relaxation was investigated by imaging the surface of the bone surrounding the screw immediately after screw fastening at logarithmic intervals up till 17 hours post-fixation. Strains were evaluated using digital image correlation (Ncorr v 1. 2, G. I. T., USA). An axisymmetric finite element (FE) model was developed based on the experimental tests. An idealized screw geometry incorporating screw threads was based on CT-images (Simpleware ScanIP, Exeter, UK). Using a maximum tensile strain failure criteria, (considering the tensile yield strain of cortical bone to be 1. 0 %), the FE model was used to predict the pull-out strength for the variables considered (Ansys 15. 0, USA). Results Significant stress relaxation was found to occur post-fixation, with the strain distribution appearing to be related to the proximity of the thread to the surface. There was good agreement in predicted and measured pullout force versus mean cortical thickness. Discussion Although relatively simple, the developed validated model is capable of predicting cortical bone screw pullout strength for a range of bone densities and cortical thicknesses. This study found that significant stress-relaxation occurs post-fixation, in line with previous literature [3]. Currently, the effect of screw insertion and stress-relaxation is not included in the models. The relationship between <b>fastening</b> <b>torque</b> and axial screw preload is well defined [4], thus screw insertion torque can be reasonably approximated in this way. We aim to incorporate both of these effects to understand the post-fixation screw mechanics and further improve our modelling predictions. Our intention is to develop this model into a patient-specific tool providing surgeons with guidance regarding appropriate screw fastening torques for different bone qualities. This tool has the potential to enhance construct stability and reduce the incidence of failures. The developed model could also be used as a design tool for screws. References 1.
