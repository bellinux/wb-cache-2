It transfers fluid by means of the progress, through the pump, of a sequence of small, fixed shape, discrete cavities, as its rotor is turned. This leads to the volumetric flow rate being proportional to the rotation rate (bidirectionally) and to low levels of shearing being applied to the pumped fluid. Hence these pumps have application in <b>fluid</b> <b>metering</b> and pumping of viscous or shear-sensitive materials.

Orifice meters are a type of differential meter, all of which infer the rate of gas flow by measuring the pressure difference across a deliberately designed and installed flow disturbance. The gas static pressure, density, viscosity, and temperature must be measured or known {{in addition to the}} differential pressure for the meter to accurately measure the <b>fluid.</b> Orifice <b>meters</b> often do not handle a large range of flow rates.

For this reason, they are often used to measure the flow of hydraulic fluids. Compared with orifice-type meters, PD meters require very little straight upstream piping since they are not sensitive to uneven flow distribution across the area of the pipe. Positive displacement flow meters can provide better relative accuracy at low flows than orifice-type flow meters. However, a positive displacement meter can be considerably heavier and more costly than non-positive-displacement types such as orifice plates, magnetic or vortex flow meters.|$|R

For such experiments to be feasible, continuous cultures are utilized to ensure consistent conditions. However, since medium must be replenished every cell doubling time, costs can be prohibitive in large reactors. An integrated microscale bioreactor with built-in <b>fluid</b> <b>metering</b> and environmental control will enable programmed experiments capable of generating reproducible data routinely. This work develops an instrument capable of supporting automated microscale continuous culture experiments. The instrument consists of a plastic-PDMS device capable of continuous flow reactions without volume drift. A novel bonding process is invented to fabricate devices with chemically stable interfaces against water, acids, and bases. We introduce a direct CNC machining and chemical bonding fabrication process for production of fluidic devices with a 1 mL working volume, high oxygen transfer rate (kLa ~ 0. 025 s- 1), fast mixing (2 s), accurate flow control (± 18 nL), and closed loop control over temperature, cell density, oxygen, and pH. Providing control over environmental parameters allows the system to perform different types of cell culture on a single device, such as batch, fed-batch, chemostat, and turbidostat continuous culture. Validation experiments demonstrate that cells can be grown to high optical densities (OD = 50) and production of commercially relevant chemicals such as DNA vaccines are comparable to large scale bench fermentations. Continuous cultures are also demonstrated without contamination for 3 weeks in a single device and both steady state and dynamically controlled conditions are possible, allowing observations of cell metabolic dynamics. by Kevin Shao-Kwan Lee.

It is therefore {{important to understand the}} causes of such undesirable characteristics in control system especially in the automobile fuel gauges. This is because without accurate fuel gauges in automobile systems, it will be difficult if not impossible to embark on a journey whether during odd hours of the day or where fuel is difficult to obtain. To this end, this work studied the impacts of fuel tank rust and faulty component of fuel gauge system (voltage stabilizer) on the chaotic characteristics of fuel gauges. The results obtained were analyzed using Graph iSOFT package. Over the range of experiments conducted, the results obtained showed that rust effect of the fuel tank would alter the flow density, consequently the fluid pressure and ultimately the flow velocity of the fuel. The responses of the fuel gauge pointer to the faulty voltage stabilizer were erratic causing noticeable instability of gauge measurands indicated. The experiment also showed that the fuel gauge performed optimally by indicating the highest degree of accuracy when combined the effect of rust free tank and non-faulty voltage stabilizer conditions (± 6. 75 % measurand error) as compared to only the rust free tank situation (± 15 % measurand error) and only the non-faulty voltage stabilizer condition (± 40 % measurand error). The study concludes that both the fuel tank rust and the faulty voltage stabilizer gauge component {{have a significant effect on}} the sensitivity of fuel gauge and its accuracy ultimately.

5000|$|Conventional {{cell culture}} {{technology}} {{is unable to}} efficiently allow combinatorial testing of drug candidates, growth factors, neuropeptides, genes, and retroviruses in cell culture medium. Due {{to the need for}} cells to be fed periodically with fresh medium and passaged, even testing a few conditions requires a large number of cells and supplies, expensive and bulky incubators, large fluid volumes (~0.1 - 2 mL per sample), and tedious human labour. The requirement of human labour also limits the number and length between time points for experiments. Microfluidic cell cultures are potentially a vast improvement because they can be automated, as well as yield lower overall cost, higher throughput, and more quantitative descriptions of single-cell behaviour variability. By including gas exchange and temperature control systems on chip, microfluidic cell culturing can eliminate the need for incubators and tissue culture hoods. [...] However, this type of continuous microfluidic cell culture operation presents its own unique challenges as well. Flow control is important when seeding cells into microchannels because flow needs to be stopped after the initial injection of cell suspension for cells to attach or become trapped in microwells, dielectrophoretic traps, micromagnetic traps, or hydrodynamic traps. Subsequently, flow needs to be resumed {{in a way that does}} not produce large forces that shear the cells off the substrate. Dispensing fluids by manual or robotic pipetting can be replaced with micropumps and microvalves, where <b>fluid</b> <b>metering</b> is straightforward to determine as opposed to continuous flow systems by micromixers. A fully automated microfluidic cell culture system has been developed to study osteogenic differentiation of human embryonic stem cells. A handheld microfluidic cell culture incubator capable of heating and pumping cell culture solutions has also been developed. Due to the volume reduction in microfluidic cultures, the collected concentrations are higher for better signal-to-noise ratio measurements, but collection and detection is correspondingly more difficult. In situ microscopy assays with microfluidic cell cultures may help in this regard, but have inherently lower throughput due to the microscope probe having only a small field of view. Micropatterned co-cultures have also contributed to bio-MEMS for tissue engineering to recapitulate in vivo conditions and 3D natural structure. Specifically, hepatocytes have been patterned to co-culture at specific cell densities with fibroblasts to maintain liver-specific functions such as albumin secretion, urea synthesis, and p450 detoxification. Similarly, integrating microfluidics with micropatterned co-cultures has enabled modelling of organs where multiple vascularized tissues interface, such as the blood-brain barrier and the lungs. Organ-level lung functions have been reconstituted on lung-on-a-chip devices where a porous membrane and the seeded epithelial cell layer are cyclically stretched by applied vacuum on adjacent microchannels to mimic inhalation.|$|R

50|$|An oval gear meter is a {{positive}} displacement meter that uses two or more oblong gears configured to rotate {{at right angles to}} one another, forming a T shape. Such a meter has two sides, which can be called A and B. No fluid passes {{through the center of the}} meter, where the teeth of the two gears always mesh. On one side of the meter (A), the teeth of the gears close off the fluid flow because the elongated gear on side A is protruding into the measurement chamber, while on the other side of the meter (B), a cavity holds a fixed volume of fluid in a measurement chamber. As the fluid pushes the gears, it rotates them, allowing the fluid in the measurement chamber on side B to be released into the outlet port. Meanwhile, fluid entering the inlet port will be driven into the measurement chamber of side A, which is now open. The teeth on side B will now close off the fluid from entering side B. This cycle continues as the gears rotate and <b>fluid</b> is <b>metered</b> through alternating measurement chambers.

Initial demonstrations of real-time spectroscopic measurements on cold-stream simulants were conducted using plutonium (Pu) /uranium (U) (PUREX) solvent extraction process conditions. The specific test case examined the extraction of neodymium nitrate (Nd(NO 3) 3) from an aqueous nitric acid (HNO 3) feed into a tri-n-butyl phosphate (TBP) / n-dodecane solvent. Demonstration testing of this system included diverting a sample from the aqueous feed meanwhile monitoring the process in every phase using the on-line spectroscopic process monitoring system. The purpose of this demonstration was to test whether spectroscopic monitoring is capable of determining the mass balance of metal nitrate species involved in a cross-current solvent extraction scheme while also diverting a sample from the system. The diversion scenario involved diverting {{a portion of the}} feed from a counter-current extraction system while a continuous extraction experiment was underway. A successful test would demonstrate the ability of the process monitoring system to detect and quantify the diversion of material from the system during a real-time continuous solvent extraction experiment. The system was designed to mimic a PUREX-type extraction process with a bank of four centrifugal contactors. The aqueous feed contained Nd(NO 3) 3 in HNO 3, and the organic phase was composed of TBP/n-dodecane. The amount of sample observed to be diverted by on-line spectroscopic process monitoring was measured to be 3 mmol (3 x 10 - 3 mol) Nd 3 +. This value was in excellent agreement with the 2. 9 mmol Nd 3 + value based on the known mass of sample taken (i. e., diverted) directly from the system feed solution...|$|R
