25|$|A {{number of}} blood {{substitutes}} have been explored (and still are), but thus far they all suffer from many challenges. Most {{attempts to find}} a suitable alternative to blood thus far have concentrated on cell-free hemoglobin solutions. Blood substitutes could make transfusions more readily available in emergency medicine and in pre-hospital EMS care. If successful, such a blood substitute could save many lives, particularly in trauma where massive blood loss results. <b>Hemopure,</b> a hemoglobin-based therapy, is approved for use in South Africa.|$|E

50|$|With such a {{promising}} technology, Biopure {{was faced with}} many issues {{that have led to}} the company’s current condition. By 1999, the US FDA and European Commission had approved Oxyglobin for the treatment for anemic dogs. By April 2001, South Africa’s Medicine Control Council approved <b>Hemopure</b> for treatment of surgical patients who are acutely anemic, to help generate revenue for the company. However, Biopure’s global commercialization strategy of marketing <b>Hemopure</b> in the US and European countries was still in its infant stages. During this time, <b>Hemopure</b> was still in Phase III and the company faced many challenges over this period of time. With the IPO of stock in 2001, Biopure was prepared to revolutionize the oxygen therapeutic industry with <b>Hemopure.</b> The company was ready to scale up manufacturing with the impending approval of <b>Hemopure.</b> In December 2002, the company was also looking to add a large scale manufacturing facility that would produce 500,000 <b>Hemopure</b> units a year (2003 Biopure 10-K). Majority of the employees of the company were in the manufacturing department {{and was one of the}} biggest costs to the company. By 2003, the company had to reduce the workforce to cut cost since <b>Hemopure</b> status was in a standstill in Phase III.|$|E
50|$|Two {{additional}} cross-linked polymers of bovine (<b>Hemopure,</b> Biopure, Cambridge, MA) {{and human}} (PolyHeme, Northfield Laboratories, Inc.) origin {{have been used}} in trials during cardiac and abdominal surgery as well as in trauma patients. The intravascular half-life of <b>Hemopure</b> (polymerised form of bovine haemoglobin with a P-50 of 30 mm Hg) is approximately 24 hours, and the excretion is non-renal. Administration of <b>Hemopure</b> leads to vasoconstrictive effects that may increase systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance with resultant decreases in cardiac index. The authors did emphasize that the product served as a bridge over days, until blood became available, or the patient's own red cells were regenerated. <b>Hemopure</b> is undergoing phase III clinical trials as a perioperative alternative to red blood cell transfusion in orthopedic surgery in the United States, the European Union, Canada, and South Africa.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hemopure,</b> as {{with any}} oxygen {{carrying}} therapeutic, carries a risk of being used improperly as a performance enhancement in sports. According to VeloNews, on July 20, 2007, Tour de France leader Michael Rasmussen was accused by mountain bike racer Whitney Richards of attempted <b>Hemopure</b> smuggling for potential later use in a doping program.|$|E
50|$|The U.S. Naval Medical Research Center, {{which had}} been collaborating with Biopure {{in the study of}} <b>Hemopure,</b> was granted $4 million in {{additional}} Congressional funding for the United States Navy to continue research and development of <b>Hemopure.</b> This was through the FY 2006 Defense Appropriations Bill signed by President George W. Bush on December 30, 2005.|$|E

50|$|In <b>Hemopure,</b> {{the average}} oxygen content is maximized {{due to the}} reduced size of the {{stabilized}} HBOC molecules in comparison to red blood cells (RBCs). Oxyglobin primarily differs from <b>Hemopure</b> in molecule size of the stabilized HBOC. Oxyglobin is approved for oxygen fluid therapy and an alternative to RBC transfusion in dogs, and is administered intravenously as well. The stabilized HBOC then flows through the blood plasma in the body, where oxygen transport takes place. Due to the reduced size of the HBOC in <b>Hemopure,</b> oxygen can be transported to restricted areas where normal RBCs fail to reach. Another advantage of this patented oxygen technology is the increased shelf life of 36 months through storage conditions at room temperature, while RBCs must be refrigerated and must be discarded after six weeks. However, these products are only indicated for temporary oxygen replenishment through the oxygen bridge, with an average half-life of 19 hours (specifically <b>Hemopure),</b> therefore long term oxygen support requires RBC blood transfusion.|$|E
50|$|Similar to <b>Hemopure,</b> Oxyglobin is also {{developed}} by OPK Biotech LLC {{and is an}} oxygen-therapeutic based on chemically stabilized bovine hemoglobin. However, unlike <b>Hemopure,</b> which is for human use, Oxyglobin is intended for the veterinary market, and is used to treat anemia in dogs. According to OPK Biotech's corporate website, approximately 173,000 units of Oxyglobin have been sold to date, treating nearly 90,000 animals.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the last}} {{completed}} human trial of <b>Hemopure</b> in the United States, <b>Hemopure</b> {{was not found}} to be inferior to blood. However, safety concerns did arise which led the FDA to impose a ban on further clinical testing of the product on human test subjects in the United States. FDA spokeswoman Karen Riley said in a statement [...] "There have been significant safety concerns raised about this class of products." [...] Conversely, the US Navy criticized the FDA. According to the Navy the FDA's review of <b>Hemopure</b> was flawed: [...] "The reviews had consistent patterns of erroneous, misleading, and anecdotal statements, reporting bias, changing requirements, no 'sense of urgency,' [...] " [...] as well as conflicts of interest.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hemopure</b> was {{approved}} for human use and commercial sale in South Africa April 2001, a {{first and only}} for this product class.|$|E
5000|$|Biopure Corporation was a {{biopharmaceutical}} {{company that}} specialized in oxygen therapeutics (blood substitutes) for {{both human and}} veterinary use. The company developed, manufactured, and marketed oxygen therapeutics, designed to transport oxygen to the body's tissues. The oxygen technology uses hemoglobin-based oxygen carrying molecules in solution (HBOCs) to increase oxygen transfer to the tissues. The competing companies with Biopure were Allied Pharmaceutical, Northfield Laboratories, Baxter International and Hemosol of Toronto. The company developed two products: <b>Hemopure</b> (HBOC-1) [...] for human use, and Oxyglobin (HBOC-301) [...] for veterinary use. [...] As of April 2001, <b>Hemopure</b> was approved for commercial sale in South Africa for treatment of acute anemia in general surgery. However, <b>Hemopure</b> {{has not been able}} to gain approval in the U.K. or the U.S. because of safety and reliability concerns of the European Commission and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) respectively. The company formed an agreement with the U.S. Navy to aid in preclinical testing of <b>Hemopure</b> for out-of-hospital treatment of trauma patients in hemorrhagic shock. Oxyglobin is the only oxygen therapeutic approved for treatment of canine anemia in both Europe and the U.S. and has treated thousands of cases. [...] Unable to obtain FDA approval for <b>Hemopure</b> to date, Biopure ceased operations in 2009 and its assets were purchased by OPK Biotech LLC in September 2009. [...] On July 16, 2009 Biopure announced it had filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code and entered into an agreement with OPK Biotech LLC for the sale of substantially all of its assets [...]|$|E
50|$|<b>Hemopure</b> {{has also}} been {{requested}} and used in compassionate use cases. A recent case was for a 33-year-old Australian woman who was severely injured in a car crash.|$|E
50|$|The main {{categories}} of 'oxygen-carrying' blood substitutes being pursued are hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOC) and perfluorocarbon-based oxygen carriers (PFBOC). Oxygen therapeutics are {{in clinical trials}} in the U.S. and Europe, and <b>Hemopure</b> is available in South Africa.|$|E
50|$|Biopure, the {{original}} developers and producers of <b>Hemopure</b> and Oxyglobin, {{filed for bankruptcy}} protection under Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code in 2009 Its assets were subsequently purchased by OPK Biotech, a privately held firm headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts.|$|E
50|$|According to the company, <b>Hemopure</b> {{is stable}} for 36 months at room temperature, {{compatible}} with all blood types (no requirement for blood typing, testing or cross-matching, it is purified to remove or inactivate potential contaminants, including infectious agents (e.g. viruses, bacteria and TSE agents).|$|E
50|$|Biopure {{was forced}} into a {{position}} to continue raising money to fund the clinical trials {{in a variety of}} indications in hopes of getting <b>Hemopure</b> onto the market. Many of the clinical trials results were being revealed and in April 2003, the FDA put on a hold of a proposed clinical trial on <b>Hemopure</b> for the use in trauma patients in the hospital setting. The company did not disclose that their clinical trial was on hold to the public and tried to go for an in-hospital trauma trial designation as a separate investigational new drug application(INDA) from the pending biologic license application (BLA) for orthopedic surgery indication. In July 2003, the FDA did not approve <b>Hemopure</b> for orthopedic surgery and had major concerns about the materials submitted to support the BLA and safety issues. In August 2003, Biopure announced to the street through public statements that the FDA was favorable and caused the stock to go up 20%. The company continued with its misleading statements and was able to raise $35 million by December 2003 from the sales of common stock. Information was leaked about the incomplete and misleading documents between late October and end of December 2003, which led to the stock dropping by 66% from the August 1, 2003 stock price.|$|E

50|$|For <b>Hemopure,</b> Biopure took a {{long time}} to {{establish}} which medical indication upon which to focus the majority of its attention. This can be seen through its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as the company changed Hemopure’s marketing and approval strategies over the seven years that the company was publicly traded.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hemopure,</b> {{developed}} and produced by OPK Biotech, is a hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier based on chemically stabilized bovine hemoglobin. It {{has been developed}} for potential use in humans as an oxygen delivering bridge in cases when blood is not available or is not an option. The product, Hemoglobin-glutamer 250 (Bovine) approved for human use and sale in South Africa for several years.|$|E
50|$|In the 1990s, {{because of}} the risk of undetected blood bank {{contamination}} from HIV, hepatitis C, and other emergent diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, there was additional motivation to pursue oxygen therapeutics. Significant progress was achieved, and a haemoglobin-based oxygen therapeutic called <b>Hemopure</b> was approved for Phase III trial (in elective orthopedic surgery) in the U.S., and more widely approved for human use in South Africa.|$|E
50|$|The FDA and Biopure {{reached an}} {{agreement}} to conduct a series of animal tests designed to study those safety concerns and determine whether {{a new round of}} human testing could safely be initiated. Most, if not all, of these tests have been completed and their findings submitted and studied by the FDA. Outside the United States, human testing of <b>Hemopure</b> is allowed in South Africa and in Europe.|$|E
50|$|Out of the second-generation PCFs that {{advanced}} onto phase III trials, Oxygent got {{the closest}} to getting regulatory approval, but the results led {{to the end of}} these trials. Development on PolyHeme and <b>Hemopure,</b> has continued in order to pass these trials. Further development on Oxygent may have been terminated as a result of expenses or doubt about the product’s future success but it's a lot clinical potential for oxygen delivery despite this.|$|E

50|$|According to {{clinical}} trials with <b>Hemopure,</b> the following adverse events occurred at {{greater than or}} equal to 5%: transient yellow skin discoloration, nausea, mild to moderate increase in blood pressure (10 to 20 mm/Hg), vomiting, low urine output, difficulty swallowing, flatulence, and low red blood cell count. The use of Oxyglobin has shown the following common side effects: discoloration of the skin, mucous membranes and urine. Adverse events such as vomiting and melena (dark color feces) can also occur. Dogs with impaired cardiac function and other conditions that are prediposed to circulatory overload can have adverse events after Oxyglobin administration. Repeat administration requires careful monitoring.|$|E
50|$|Oxygent is a {{human blood}} {{substitute}} designed for surgical applications by the Alliance Pharmaceutical Corp for moderate anemia. Oxygent is a lecithin-stabilized emulsion of a perfluorocarbon (PCF). It {{is one of several}} second generation PCF that has been further improved upon throughout the years to prevent retention of PFC in organs, others HemAssist, PolyHeme, <b>Hemopure.</b> Oxygent acts as an oxygen delivery method from which the oxygen carried can be easily extracted by the surrounded tissues for later consumption. The substance had not been approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as there are questions about its safety. Phase 2 trials were announced in 2007 but phase 3 trials have been halted. Oxygent performed well in a phase 2 clinical trial in Europe when applied in general surgeries, but Oxygent failed in the final study in this phase. During the study, there was an increase in incidences of strokes among the Oxygent-treated patients, and the study was stopped.|$|E

40|$|The {{complications}} {{associated with}} acquiring and storing whole blood for transfusions have launched substantial {{efforts to develop}} a blood substitute. The history of these efforts involves a complicated mixture of science, ethics, and business. This review focuses on clinical trials of the three hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOC) that have progressed to Phase II or III clinical trials: HemAssist (Baxter; Deerfield, IL, US), PolyHeme (Northfield; Evanston, IL, US), and <b>Hemopure</b> (Biopure; Cambridge, MA, US). Published animal studies and clinical trials carried out in a perioperative setting have demonstrated that these products successfully transport and deliver oxygen, but all may induce hypertension and lead to unexpectedly low cardiac outputs. Overall, these studies suggest that HBOCs resulted in only modest blood saving during and after surgery, no improvement in mortality and an increased incidence of adverse reactions. To date, the results from these perioperative studies have not led to regulatory approval. All three companies instead chose to focus their efforts on large trials of trauma patients in the pre-hospital setting. Baxter abandoned the development of HemAssist after a trial in the U. S. was prematurely halted when the first 100 patients showed significantly increased mortality rates as compared to patients treated with blood products. Northfield's PolyHeme trial demonstrated a non-significant trend towards increased mortality and a very modest reduction in the subsequent need for blood. The testing of Biopure's <b>Hemopure</b> for trauma patients has been halted for several years because of FDA concerns over trial design and study justification. Ethical concerns have also been raised regarding the design and implementation of all HBOC clinical trials. Thus, the available evidence suggests that HemAssist, Polyheme, and <b>Hemopure</b> {{are associated with a}} significant level of cardiovascular dysfunction. The next generation of HBOCs remains under development...|$|E
40|$|A specific, {{sensitive}} and rapid analytical procedure based on capillary electrophoresis with UV/Vis detection at 405 and 415 nm {{was developed and}} validated to detect human haemoglobin and haemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (<b>Hemopure</b> (R), Oxyglobin (R) and Polyheme (R)) in blood samples collected for doping control. The electrophoretic separation, based on capillary dynamic coating, was achieved in less than 10 min. The effects of capillary temperature, injection conditions and initial ramping were investigated. The optimum separation voltage was 25 kV with a capillary temperature of 20 degrees C, initial ramping of 1 kV/s and an injection pressure of 0. 5 psi for 10 s. The removal of haptoglobin using anti-human haptoglobin antibody prior to the analysis was mandatory to increase the specificity of the analysis. Sufficient resolution between endogenous haemoglobin variants and the three haemoglobin-based oxygen carriers here investigated was obtained, thus allowing discrimination between a normal haemolysed sample and a sample in which Oxyglobin (R), <b>Hemopure</b> (R) or Polyheme (R) is present. Good repeatability of migration times (CV% less than 1), peak resolution and adequate sensitivity (limit of detection: 2. 5 mg/mL) was obtained...|$|E

40|$|Under normal conditions, only 20 - 30 % of the {{delivered}} oxygen is metabolised. In normovolaemic anaemia, {{the organism}} reacts with increases in cardiac output and oxygen extraction.

40|$|Top-loading This study {{compared}} {{the effects on}} oxygen (O 2) transport of four fluids: 5. 9 % human serum albumin (HSA) a non-O 2 carrying iso-oncotic solution (volume control);HBOC- 201 (<b>Hemopure,</b> Biopure Corp., Cambridge, MA); MP 50, HBOC- 201 with a P 50 of 18 mmHg; and lastly LP 50, an HBOC- 201 with P 50 of 17 mmHg and higher viscosity (4 cP). It has been proposed that HBOC with a higher O 2 affinity and a viscosity closer to that of whole blood will cause less vasoconstriction and thus a lower MAP than <b>Hemopure</b> (P 50 = 40 mmHg and 2. 2 cP). Intravital microscopic measurements were made on the spinotrapezius muscle of anesthetized, male Sprague-Dawley rats. Interstitial PO 2 was measured using phosphorescence quenching microscopy at baseline and following four top-loading infusions, in which increasing concentrations of HBOC- 201 were infused to reach target plasma concentrations of 1, 10, 100 and 300 μM. Both HBOC- 201 and MP 50 increased PO 2 by about 10 %, but PO 2 was unchanged with LP 50. LP 50 was more hypertensive (160 ± 5 mmHg) than HBOC- 201 (144 ± 5) and MP 50 (141 ± 6). Arteriolar diameters {{were not significantly different}} among the three HBOCs. The lower P 50 HBOCs did not lead to higher PO 2 compared with HBOC- 201 and the higher viscosity HBOC led to higher MAP. Hemorrhage and Resuscitation This study {{compared the}} efficacy of three resuscitation fluids in a model of hemorrhage and resuscitation: HBOC- 201, a hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier ([Hb] = 13 ± 1 g/dl; Biopure Corp.), HBOC- 201 with 92 μg/ml nitroglycerin (NTG), and 5. 9 % human serum albumin, a non-oxygen carrying colloid solution. Intravital microscopic measurements were made on the spinotrapezius muscle of anesthetized, male Sprague-Dawley rats. Interstitial fluid (ISF) oxygen tension (PO 2) was measured using phosphorescence quenching microscopy at baseline, post-hemorrhage and three post-resuscitation time points. Following 40 % blood volume withdrawal, animals were maintained in this condition for 30 minutes before resuscitation was begun. Baseline ISF PO 2 (65 ± 2 mmHg) decreased during hemorrhage (3. 6 ± 0. 4 mmHg) and all resuscitation fluids increased ISF PO 2 towards baseline. HBOC- 201 with nitroglycerin produced the highest PO 2 throughout the experimental time course, and the findings are consistent with the NO scavenging theory because adding NO alleviated known side effects such as increased vascular resistance and hypertension that are associated with HBOC- 201 infusions...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Logistic {{constraints}} on combat casualty care preclude traditional resuscitation strategies which can require volumes and weights 3 fold {{or greater than}} hemorrhaged volume. We present a review of quantitative analyses of clinical and animal data on small volume strategies using 1) hypertonic-hyperosmotic solutions (HHS); 2) hemoglobin based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) and 3) closed-loop infusion regimens. Methods and Results: Literature searches and recent queries to industry and academic researchers have allowed us to evaluate the record of 81 human HHS studies (12 trauma trials), 19 human HBOCs studies (3 trauma trials) and two clinical studies of closed-loop resuscitation. There are several hundreds animal studies and at least 82 clinical trials and reports evaluating small volume 7. 2 %- 7. 5 % hypertonic saline (HS) most often combined with colloids, e. g., dextran (HSD) or hetastarch(HSS). HSD and HSS data has been published for 1, 108 and 392 patients, respectively. Human studies have documented volume sparing and hemodynamic improvements. Meta-analyses suggest improved survival for hypotensive trauma patients treated with HSD with significant reductions in mortality found for patients with blood pressure < 70 mmHg, head trauma, and penetrating injury requiring surgery. HSD and HSS have received regulatory approval in 14 and 3 countries, respectively, with 81, 000 + units sold. The primary reported use was head injury and trauma resuscitation. Complications and reported adverse events are surprisingly rare and {{not significantly different from}} other solutions. HBOCs are potent volume expanders in addition to oxygen carriers with volume expansion greater than standard colloids. Several investigators have evaluated small volume hyperoncotic HBOCs or HS-HBOC formulations for hypotensive and normotensive resuscitation in animals. A consistent finding in resuscitation with HBOCs is depressed cardiac output. There is some evidence that HBOCs more efficiently unload oxygen from plasma hemoglobin as well as facilitate RBC unloading. We analyzed one volunteer study, 15 intraoperative trials, and 3 trauma studies using HBOCs. Perioperative studies generally suggest ability to deliver oxygen, but one trauma trial using HBOCs (HemAssist) for treatment of trauma resulted in a dramatic increase in mortality, while an intraoperative trauma study using Polyheme demonstrated reductions in blood use and lower mortality compared to historic controls of patients refusing blood. Transfusion reductions with HBOC use have been modest. Two HBOCs (<b>Hemopure</b> and Polyheme) are now in new or planned large-scale multicenter prehospital trials of trauma treatment. A new implementation of small volume resuscitation is closed-loop resuscitation (CLR), which employs microprocessors to titrate just enough fluid to reach a physiologic target. Animal studies suggest less risk of rebleeding in uncontrolled hemorrhage and a reduction in fluid needs with CLR. The first clinical application of CLR was treatment of burn shock and the US Army. Conclusions: Independently sponsored civilian trauma trials and clinical evaluations in operational combat conditions of different small volume strategies are warranted...|$|E
