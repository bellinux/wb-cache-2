30|$|As {{regards the}} {{qualitative}} {{dimension of the}} study, 12 key informants who had in-depth knowledge about the immigrants’ trading activities were purposively selected and interviewed. These comprised one interviewee each of Ghana Immigration Service [GIS], Ghana Union of Traders Association [GUTA], and Ghana Investment Promotion Centre [GIPC]. The other interviewees were nine leaders of the immigrant traders (one from each study community) who {{were responsible for the}} coordination of their <b>itinerant</b> <b>trading</b> activities in the study sites. Interview schedule (researcher-administered questionnaire) and in-depth interview guide [IDI] were used to collect the data for the study. The interview schedule helped because the questions were worded in the English Language as most West African immigrants in <b>itinerant</b> petty <b>trading</b> in Ghana are either illiterates or not well educated enough to read and understand the English Language (GSS, 2013), particularly those who originated from Francophone countries. The instruments were administered by the researcher and four trained field assistants in the local languages (Asante Twi and Ga), English, French and Hausa which are the dominant languages spoken among the immigrant traders. The instrument comprised both open-ended and closed ended questions.|$|R
30|$|According to Skinner (2008) and Peberdy (2016), a {{major factor}} that swells the number of {{itinerant}} street traders in sub-Saharan Africa is international migration. As Landau (2007) points out, international migration is an inexorable response to regional economic inequalities. <b>Itinerant</b> <b>trading</b> is thus what many foreign immigrants opt to do at their destinations. Lonreco-Lindell (2004) for example cites {{the case of the}} Dyulas-itinerant traders who have been active in West Africa for centuries, moving goods across borders. For many villages, itinerant migrant traders are the primary source of supplies (Skinner, 2008). Peberdy’s (2016) study, one of the few surveys on cross border traders in Southern Africa, suggested that itinerant migrant traders either supply domestic street traders or sell their wares directly.|$|R
30|$|The {{interview}} schedule and the IDI guide were structured in three main parts. The first part elicited {{responses on the}} socio-demographic characteristics of the immigrants (e.g. sex, country of origin, age, education, marital status, duration in trade, previous occupation at origin, religious affiliation & household size) while the second part covered their main <b>itinerant</b> <b>trading</b> activities at the destination. The last aspect of the instruments assessed their livelihood status using seven main livelihood indicators namely: permanency of their occupation [improved job security], ability to afford adequate food {{for themselves and their}} families [improved food security], ability to afford their health care needs, ability to withstand occasional price shocks on basic necessities of life [improved vulnerability], acquisition of household assets and formation of relevant social capital to depend on during difficult times (improved social networks).|$|R

30|$|Adepoju (2005), Olsen (2011) and International Organization for Migration [IOM] (2013) {{observed}} that migrants in West Africa have historically considered the sub-region as one big economic unit within which {{trade in goods}} and services typically flow, and that <b>itinerant</b> <b>trade</b> had been an important feature of the phenomenon. Rouch (1956), {{one of the pioneers}} who highlighted the significance of itinerant migrant trading in the twentieth-century West Africa, noted that most of the immigrants to Ghana were self-employed itinerant retailers from Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger and Togo rather than wage labourers. The pervasiveness of itinerant trading of migrants has also been corroborated by Peil (1974), Eades (1994), Anarfi et al. (1997), Aniegye (2012) and GSS (2014), who indicated that itinerant migrant traders have played significant roles in the economy of Ghana by guaranteeing access to essential commodities and services. GSS (2013) and Ajavon (2014) argued that the recent increases in informal trading activities in Ghana is largely attributed to the influx of undocumented immigrants from neighbouring West African countries and immigrant entrepreneurs from outside the African continent namely Lebanon and China.|$|E

King Charles III took on a more progressive attitude to Gitano assimilation, proclaiming their equal rights as Spanish citizens and ending official denigration based on their race. While he prohibited the nomadic lifestyle, the use of the Calo language, Romani clothing, their trade in horses and other <b>itinerant</b> <b>trades,</b> he also forbade any form of discrimination against them or barring them from the guilds. The use of the word gitano was also forbidden to further assimilation, substituted for [...] "New Castilian", which was also applied to former Jews and Muslims.|$|R
30|$|The {{study was}} {{cross-sectional}} {{in nature and}} used the quantitative dominant concurrent nested (QUANT+qual) design for this study. Accordingly, in terms of status and integration, the study was largely quantitative dominant both at the data collection and the analysis stages with the qualitative dimension playing a supportive role. Data for the study were mainly derived from a survey and in-depth interviews from a much wider study conducted in 2017 in the Accra Metropolis. The data covered the socio-demographic characteristics of the immigrants, their main trading activities, and issues on their overall livelihood status. The target population comprised West African migrants who were engaged in any form of <b>itinerant</b> petty <b>trading</b> in the AMA. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study involved two issues 1) the immigrant must have engaged in <b>itinerant</b> <b>trading</b> {{for at least one}} year and 2) must not be a dual national, naturalized or a national by marriage. The one-year benchmark was adopted in selecting the immigrants because the UN classifies people who reside in countries of destinations for 1 year or more as permanent migrants and describes those who stay below 1 year as temporary migrants or visitors. The 2010 PHC reports also reveal that the longest duration of stay of most foreign migrants in the AMA is between 1 and 4 [*]years (GSS, 2014). The unit of analysis was the individual itinerant immigrant trader and the data obtained from the field were analysed at the individual immigrant level.|$|R
30|$|Contrarily, it was {{noticed that}} {{immigrant}} traders who {{were less than}} 20 [*]years were about 0.478 times less likely to reduce vulnerabilities to occasional price shocks on basic necessities as {{compared to those who}} were older (40 – 49 [*]years) (Table 3). The current finding could be attributed to the fact that these group of immigrants (those aged <[*] 20) might have been inexperienced in the business as compared to those who were older to overcome occasional prices shocks. As regards assets acquisition, Table 3 revealed that immigrants who were young (<[*] 20 – 29 [*]years) were less likely to have improved asset-holding status as compared to those who were older (40 – 49 [*]years). This revelation again could be {{due to the fact that}} those immigrant traders who were elderly might have been involved in their <b>itinerant</b> <b>trading</b> activities for longer periods and are, therefore, more likely to accumulate sufficient assets. In general, age indicated a statistically significant effect on the overall livelihood status of the immigrant traders and those who were much younger (<[*] 20 [*]years) were less likely to better their lots as compared to those who were older (40 – 45 [*]years) (Table 3).|$|R
30|$|In {{spite of}} {{advances}} in modern retailing, {{a greater number}} of people throughout the world still earn their livelihood partly or exclusively through itinerant trading of goods on the streets (Skinner, 2008; Ghana Statistical Service [GSS], 2012; Koroma et al., 2017). In stressing this view, Little (1999) and Turner and Oswin (2015) stated that itinerant trading of wares is a common livelihood activity, particularly in the global south and that it is widely undertaken in urban settings with a significant customer base. The term <b>itinerant</b> <b>trade</b> is defined as a livelihood activity that takes place outside the shop environment or formal norms of economic transactions established by the state and formal business practice (American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists [AAPS], n.d.; Hart, 1973; Skinner, 2008; Ghana Statistical Service [GSS], 2012). This covers costermongers selling food products on the streets of major cities; hawkers and peddlers with trays or barrows of wares selling along the streets or selling door to door (Thorsen, 2012). In this study, itinerant traders have been conceptualized as mobile retailers who sell wares using different instruments to aid mobility (e.g. bicycles, hand cart, trolley-pushers, barrows) or who moved {{from one place to another}} by foot.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} Kathiawad Vaghri, a {{depressed}} community of itinerant traders who hail from Gujarat and engage in various forms of trade all over India. It explores the history of the caste, examining their social marginalisation and ambiguity from the 1700 s. As forest hunters and itinerant traders who maintained patron-client relationships with local Rajputs, worshipped goddesses and held origin myths connecting them to the Middle East, the Vaghri did not fit easily into the category of caste or tribe as these categories became more rigidly codified during the colonial era. At the same time, their ambiguous marginality is picked up by a regime that articulated a fantasy of occult criminality in the nineteenth century figure of the thugg. This resulted in the Criminal Tribes Act (CTA) (1871) through which the social marginalisation of the Vaghri was greatly extended and a stigma attached that persists into the present day. The second section of the thesis considers the adaptive responses of the Vaghri to this history of alterity, stigma and persecution. It traces their departure from Gujarat {{in the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth centuries, the nature of their migration, their emergence as hawkers and petty traders on the streets of Mumbai and their continuing connections with their original villages in Gujarat. These new practices made control under the CTA more possible as the Vaghri are increasingly identified as petty thieves who use trade as a cover for theft. De-notification of the criminal tribes occurs in 1952. However, the stigma of criminality persists and is reproduced in the development agenda, which the Vaghri largely reject. Their response was to create a caste for themselves, the Vaghri Sarvodaya Samaj through which a new Vaghri identity was imagined through a partial internalisation of the colonial surveillance apparatus as a moralistic and welfare-oriented control apparatus that articulates the Vaghri with the national project. The removal of the Act also sees the Vaghri return to forms of mobility and trade not seen since the beginning of the century, through which an earlier Vaghri pattern of <b>itinerant</b> <b>trade</b> with a fairly strong sense of community is reproduced. Trade in embroidered Gujarati textiles and antiques emerges in the 1970 s as a response to the presence of a new and comparatively wealthy client base in the form of international tourists whom Vaghri call “the Hippies”. Bolstered by the careful arrangement of marriages within the caste and the role of the Vaghri Samaj as a trade guild, extensive familial and caste-based trade networks continue to develop and by the 1980 s an increasing number of families are moving into handicrafts and travelling to tourist centres throughout India. However, the perils and ambiguity of <b>itinerant</b> <b>trade</b> continue. This is explored through a case study of a small tourist centre in Kerala, dominated politically and economically by members of the Ezhava community—a depressed caste with a history of exp loitation and oppression who, unlike Vaghri, chose the affirmative action path. The thesis shows that social change in contemporary India continues to reflect the problems and difficulties of bureaucratic ‘capture’. The story of the Vaghri is one of struggle, prejudice and victimisation. It is also a story of adaptation and resilience that provides an ethnographic account of the history and contemporary practices of a depressed community...|$|E

Peddling {{from the}} province of Västergötland 1790 1864 Author: Pia Lundqvist Language: Swedish, with an English summary Department: Department of History, Göteborg University, Box 200, SE- 405 30 Göteborg Series: Avhandlingar från Historiska institutionen i Göteborg, 52 ISSN 1100 - 6781 ISBN 91 88614 68 9 This thesis studies the <b>itinerant</b> <b>trade</b> from a small geographical area in southern Sweden, Sjuhäradsbygden in {{the province of}} Västergötland. During the studied period, 1790 1864, pedlars from this region distributed goods to practically all of Sweden and also to its neighbouring countries. This study shows the huge extent and the wide geographical scope of peddling and above all its importance for the spreading of goods, for the increase in demand and in the prolongation also for the growth of a consumer society and industrialization. The main purpose of the investigation is to explain the strong position the pedlars from this region had in the Swedish textile market during the transition period between feudally-influenced privileged society and market society. The investigation has shown some factors to have been especially important in explaining the strong position of the peddling from Västergötland in pre-industrial Sweden: lack of competition, access to capital, flexibility, specialization and knowledge. 	In a greater historical context this study leads to a reconsideration of the earlier view of peddling. Perhaps the most important results of the study show how fluid the limits are between various forms of trade and between urban and rural economy. Peddling, with its connections to proto-industry, factory production, textile processing industry and town merchants all over the country, {{is a good example of}} the interaction between various regions and forms of production in the pre-industrial society. The dichotomies between country and town and interior and foreign trade, that the previous commercial historical research used, appear in other words far too simplified. This study has also shown that peddling has had the same importance in Sweden for early consumption changes and increase as well as in the rest of Western Europe.

30|$|The study {{analysed}} the livelihood {{activities of}} itinerant West African migrant traders who were {{permanent residents in}} the AMA of Ghana. Based on the major findings, the following conclusions and implications are drawn. The immigrants were generally young unmarried males from Niger {{and the majority of}} them were without formal education (Table 1). The dominant trading activity undertaken among the immigrants was itinerant vending of foot wears/leather belts/bags. Significant variations were found between the immigrants’ background characteristics and their livelihood status (Table 3). Nevertheless, male itinerant immigrant traders and those who were older including those involved in the sale of electronics and accessories {{were more likely to have}} improved livelihood status. The study concludes that although <b>itinerant</b> <b>trading</b> in the AMA offered an opportunity for many itinerant immigrant traders to earn a living and reduce their socio-economic vulnerabilities, it was found that young females and those who were engaged in the sale of food-related items were less likely to achieve improved livelihood status (Table 3) perhaps due to excessive and unfair competition from their male counterparts and the risk usually associated with the marketing of food items.|$|R
30|$|Again, age had {{significant}} impact on the livelihood status of the immigrant traders (Table 3). Immigrants who were aged between 20 and 29 [*]years were about seven {{times more likely to have}} improved job security as compared to those who were older (40 – 49 [*]years). This finding was not surprising because given the strenuous nature of <b>itinerant</b> <b>trading</b> (which largely involves moving from one location to the other), it is only natural that migrants who are youthful are more likely to be energetic and agile enough to undertake this form of business transactions with ease and make sufficient profits to guarantee the security of their businesses. As indicated by the human capital model proposed by Sjaastad (1962), Tanle (2010) and Ghana Statistical Service [GSS] (2012), the quality of human capital of a migrant would, to a greater extent, influence his/her livelihood status. The study as well revealed that immigrant traders who were younger (<[*] 20 [*]years) were about three times more likely to achieve improved food security as compared to those who were older (40 – 49 [*]years). This could be based on the fact that migrants who are relatively younger are more likely to be unmarried and thus has no responsibility of providing the food needs of their households or families.|$|R
40|$|Since the 16 th Century, {{there has}} been Travelling {{families}} in Sweden, earning their living by <b>itinerant</b> <b>trades</b> such as horse-trading, scrap-metal-dealing and tinplating. The authorities often labelled these families “tattare”. They suffered from severe discrimination, and authorities as well as scientists claimed {{that they were a}} threat against society. These claims were often made with a racialized rhetoric. In the period ca 1880 - 1955, there was a heated debate on what kind of political measures should be taken against these families. This debate, which {{is the subject of this}} thesis, was sometimes referred to as the ‘tattare question’. Three main political strategies were proposed or adopted in the ‘tattare’ question. In the countryside, small rural districts invented a variety of techniques in order to exclude Travelling families, such as imposing fines on persons who accommodated them. Government authorities and philanthropist saw assimilation as a goal rather than exclusion. They proposed various types of programs, e. g. establishing orphanages in which children labelled as ‘tattare’ should be detained and transformed into “decent” and “hard-working” citizens. Especially in the 1930 ’s and 1940 ’s, there were also proposals for a policy of more or less complete extinction of the whole group. In these proposals, persons labelled as ‘tattare’ were to be systematically sterilized. Although none of these extreme proposals were carried out, the debate did without a doubt influence the implementation of the general sterilization and childcare acts. Many persons whom the authorities labelled as ‘tattare’ were sterilized or detained at closed institutions for children and juveniles in the 20 th century...|$|R

The majority of Chinese in Nagasaki are a group from the Foochow district in the north of Hokkien Province, China (Table 1, 2). They immigrated just after 1899 when the residential restriction system for foreigners was abolished (Table 3). They came to Nagasaki relying upon their relations or upon former immigrants from the same Hokkien province. They concentrated in and around the China-town area of Shinchi-cho and had been living together at least until 1961 (Fig. 2). At first, they used to engage in <b>itinerant</b> <b>trade.</b> Then, those who earned sufficient changed their business into traders, restaurant owners, merchants of various kinds, barbers and so on. During World War II, the Chinese in Japan suffered various forms of discrimination and persecution since they were regarded as the enemy. Therefore, some of them returned to their own country. After the War, their occupation became concentrated as restaurant owners and merchants of various kinds. They obtained raw materials for their business through the courtesy of the GHQ and some even made a large profit. However, few Chinese extended their business to manufacturing, except to produce Chinese confectioneries and noodles. It was difficult for Chinese to extend their business because banking facilities tended to reject financing to Chinese companies. The opportunities to enter professional occupations for the second generation were restricted in spite of their high educational background. Most of them were obliged to succeed to their family occupations (Table 4). The conclusion of the Sino-Japanese treaty in 1972 and the following China boom in Japan enabled them to extend their business, however. Recently, as most Japanese companies have opened the doors to Chinese and banking facilities have not discriminated against Chinese companies, they have succeeded economically more than ever. Social classes among three generation, therefore, have become diversified (Table 6). The change of socio-economic status among three generations of Chinese influenced their residential pattern. After the 1960 s, the Chinese residential area extended to the whole of Nagasaki City (Fig. 3). Such residential dispersion was mainly caused by the expansion in business opportunities for the second generation. Moreover, some of the third generation migrate from Nagasaki to other metropolitan areas, such as Tokyo and Osaka, in order {{to go to college and}} to obtain more profitable jobs...|$|E
5000|$|Research {{has shown}} that the first known Muslim to arrive in Barbados was over one hundred years ago when in 1913 Abdul Rohul Amin, a silk {{merchant}} from West Bengal came to Barbados. Soon after, some more Bengalis arrived and they shared a house in Wellington Street, in the City. Some of them also lived in Milk Market and Tudor Street (upstairs Bata Shoe Shop) in Bridgetown. Most of these Bengalis married local Barbadian women and started families in Bridgetown. Today many well-known Barbadians are the grandchildren of these unions. These Muslims started the <b>itinerant</b> <b>trading</b> process, which continues up to this day. In the early stages most of the trading was with poor Barbadians living in the country areas who found it difficult to get to Bridgetown to do their shopping. The traders would take the bus to get their wares {{to the people in the}} country. If there were no buses available they would walk long distances just to accommodate the customers. Over the years, these traders built up a relationship with Barbadians, which still remains of mutual benefit. [...] Following the Bengalis, Muslims from villages in Gujarat, West India arrived. It is reported that the first of the Gujarati Muslims came in 1929. These Muslims had set out for Brazil to cut timber but ended up in Guyana and stayed there for a while. In Guyana they learnt that there was money in coal trading with Barbados. They visited Bridgetown a couple of times by boat and then decided to make Barbados their home.|$|R
30|$|In the framework, {{livelihood}} strategy {{consists of}} various livelihood activities undertaken by individuals and households {{to make a}} living. In this study, the main livelihood strategy adopted among the immigrants is migration for <b>itinerant</b> retail <b>trade.</b> According to the framework for migration and livelihood studies (Tanle, 2015), the types of livelihood strategies migrants undertake are a function of their background characteristics (e.g. sex, age, education, place of origin). In line with this view, Tanle (2014) and Awumbila (2017) maintained that migrants tend to engage in livelihood activities which in their view afford them the greatest or optimal livelihood status (measured by their earnings and savings, access to essential goods and services and general socio-economic wellbeing). Based on the above observations in the conceptual framework (Fig. 1), it was hypothesised in the study that the socio-demographic characteristics of the immigrant traders {{and the types of}} trading activities they undertake at the destination had significant influence on their livelihood status (i.e. whether it has improved or deteriorated).|$|R
3000|$|While {{acknowledging}} {{that a number}} of studies have documented the presence and trading activities of immigrants in Ghana (Akyeampong, 2006; Debrah, 2007; Obeng, 2015; Antwi-Bosiakoh, 2009; Aniegye, 2012; Ajavon, 2014; Fadayomi et al., 2014; Ohene-Marfo, 2014), studies concerning the characteristics and livelihood activities of itinerant West African migrant traders have not attracted much research attention in contemporary times (Ghana Statistical Service [GSS], 2012; GSS, 2013; Bello-Bravo, 2015; Antwi-Bosiakoh 2016). Meanwhile, Ghana as one of the main economic hubs of West Africa hosts a significant number of these immigrants who predominantly subsist in <b>itinerant</b> petty <b>trading</b> across the country (Bakewell & Jόnsson, 2011; GSS 2013). Many of these itinerant immigrant traders have become somewhat integrated into the country and have taken advantage of the Economic Community of West African States [ECOWAS] protocol on free movement and establishment to create their own itinerant retail businesses and commutes between Ghana and their home countries (Awumbila et al., 2009; Aniegye, 2012; GSS, 2013). Based on the above gap in research, the study advances the following research questions: who are these itinerant immigrant traders? What specific livelihood activities do they undertake? And has their livelihood status improved or otherwise? [...]...|$|R
50|$|A {{limiting}} factor of the Māori fortifications {{that were not}} built as set pieces, however, was {{the need for the}} people inhabiting them to leave frequently to cultivate areas for food, or to gather it from the wilderness. Consequently, pā would often be seasonally abandoned for 4 to 6 months of each year. In Māori tradition a pā would also be abandoned if a chief was killed or if some calamity took place that a tohunga (witch doctor/shaman) had attributed to an evil spirit (atua). In the 1860s, Māori, though nominally Christian, still followed aspects of their tikanga at the same time. Normally, once the kūmara had been harvested in March-April and placed in storage the inhabitants could lead a more <b>itinerant</b> lifestyle, <b>trading,</b> or harvesting gathering other foodstuffs needed for winter but this did not stop war taking place outside this time frame if the desire for utu or payback was great. To Māori, summer was the normal fighting season and this put them at a huge disadvantage when fighting the British Army with its well-organized logistics train which could fight efficiently year round.|$|R
30|$|Results {{from the}} binary {{logistic}} regression models (Table 3) showed that background {{characteristics of the}} immigrant traders (sex, age, country of origin, duration in business, type of wares traded) were significant predictors of their livelihood status which accentuate the basic assumptions of the conceptual framework for the study (framework for migration and <b>itinerant</b> migrant <b>trade)</b> and the framework for migration and livelihood studies by Tanle (2015) that personal characteristics of migrants have significant influence on the livelihood outcome of their trading activities such as their income earnings and general livelihood status. The current revelations as typified in Table 3 similarly corroborate earlier studies by Waddington (2003), International Labour Organization [ILO] (2002) and Rigg et al. (2014) that the socio-demographic characteristics of migrants have the tendency to affect their livelihood strategies and overall livelihood status. Specifically, male itinerant traders were about {{three times more likely}} to have improved job security as compared to their female counterparts due to their migration (Table 3). This finding as shown in Table 3 supports the observation made by Ghana Statistical Service [GSS], (2012) that female entrepreneurs are generally vulnerable in the market environment and thus most likely to have insecure livelihoods due to excessive and unfair competition from their male counterparts.|$|R
30|$|In West Africa, {{studies on}} {{migration}} and livelihoods are mostly limited to internal migrants. This study analyzed the livelihood activities of itinerant West African migrant traders in the Accra Metropolitan Area, using mixed methods approach. The study which {{was guided by}} the framework for migration and <b>itinerant</b> migrant <b>trade</b> surveyed 779 <b>itinerant</b> immigrant traders and interviewed 12 key informants. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression were the main analytical techniques used. The results showed {{that most of the}} immigrant traders were young, unmarried males with no formal education and their main <b>trading</b> activity was <b>itinerant</b> retailing of foot wears/leather belts/bags and herbal medicines. As regards their livelihood status, female immigrant traders and those who were younger (<[*] 20 [*]years) were less likely to have improved livelihood status. Moreover, while immigrant traders of food products {{were more likely to have}} a deteriorated livelihood status, those engaged in the sale of durable products (electronics and accessories) were most likely to achieve improved livelihood status. The study recommends that itinerant West African migrant traders should invest more of their resources in the sale of electronics and accessories as it has the highest potential of guaranteeing secured and improved livelihoods. Any form of business support aim at improving the livelihood status of itinerant immigrant traders should be focused on young and female itinerant traders and those engaged in the sale of food-related items because they were less likely to maintain improved livelihood status.|$|R

Traditionally major {{developments}} in retailing have been seen as taking place after 1850 with shops and shopping remaining traditionally organised, and probably of less importance than markets or even hawkers, during the early stages of industrialisation in Britain. Such assumptions have rarely been based on very much evidence and it is hoped that by presenting some of the evidence relating to retailing immediately before and during the early Industrial revolution a clearer picture will emerge. Thus it has been necessary to consider the extent to which shops existed in the eighteenth century, how widespread they were and how important they were in relation to non-shop retailing. The context in which retailing is examined in the thesis is that of three contrasting towns. A local approach is taken because much of the evidence relating to retailing is essentially local and because by looking in depth at a small area retailing can be seen in relation to the general economic development of the area. Two of the towns, Macclesfield and Stockport, grew rapidly from the late eighteenth century as their textile industries developed and they thus provide good examples of towns where the demand for foodstuffs could have been in danger of outstripping the institutions for their supply. Chester by contrast grew much more slowly and had long been a commercial centre serving the needs of a wide area. Thus there was no reason to look for a crisis of retail provision there, but rather to examine how far new retailing institutions were emerging to cater for growing demand for consumer goods and how far the organisation of shops was changing. Furthermore the local approach made possible an examination of the regional pattern of retail provision. The pattern of market towns and their links with one another could be examined and an attempt made to describe the functional roles of the towns in the region, This involved making some tentative suggestions about the geography of shopping centres and trying to construct a hierarchy of service centres. Although it was by no means possible to answer all the questions about retailing that could have been posed, and many questions relating to retailing economics in the eighteenth century will probably always reuain unanswered, the study of markets and shops is of considerable importance. Distribution has too frequently been ignored when economic development and town growth have been under consideration, yet without adequate provision for the distribution of food and consumer goods, urban society can hardly be sustained. The classic period of the industrial revolution is a key period for the growth of towns and for the growth of home demand, and whatever the deficiencies of the data, increased information on these matters is of value. Only by examining distribution and the general growth of services can a fuller picture emerge of the great changes taking place in the economy and society in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. The thesis begins by suggesting some of the theoretical linkage a between industrial growth and the development of retailing and then suggesting the impact of different levels of deraand and changes of levels of demand on the organisation of retailing. The local background is then considered, both in terms of the network of trade links fron the three towns chiefly examined and changes in these consequent on industrial developments in the towns, and in terms of local resources for food supply. Trading Institutions such as fairs, and particularly the fairs at Chester, are examined in Chapter 2 and in Chapter 3 Cheshire agriculture, the urban demand for food, including questions of diet, and the mechanism linking supply and demand are considered. A brief survey of the role of middlemen, of private marketing and of the consequences for food supply of improved communications leads on to an examination of the market towns of Cheshire in their role as the traditional distribution points for local surpluses and for the exchange of rural and urban products. The pattern of market towns is considered in Chapter 4 with mention being made of the periodicity of markets, the shape and size of market areas and the extent to which prices imply that there was a relatively perfect market operating in the county. The history of the markets in Macclesfield, Stockport and Chester is examined in Chapter 5 and the extent to which markets were losing wholesale functions while retaining retail functions for the sale of perishable goods is considered. Also discussed is the ability of the markets to cope with rapidly growing demand particularly in years of scarcity, and the occasional market riots are described. Finally, before turning to shops, Chapter 6 attempts to suggest the importance of <b>itinerant</b> <b>trading</b> both in the countryside and the towns in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. The examination of the importance of fixed shops begins with a study of the county pattern of service centres and a discussion of the expected shape of shopping catchment areas and their size. Some suggestions are then made about the extent of retail provision in the county as a whole and particularly about the penetration of fixed shops into villages. It is further suggested that Chester had an overwhelmingly dominant position as a shopping centre with Stockport and Macslesfield next in importance in the county. Chapters 8, 9, and 10 turn to Macclesfield, Stockport and Chester for a more detailed examination of the shops in those towns. Firstly the numbers of shops are suggested, together with the chronology of growth in shop numbers, changes in the relative importance of different types of shop and the location pattern of shops. In Chapter 9 some of the general characteristics of shop retailing are analysed and the institutional context of urban and gild regulations in which shops, particularly in Chester, operated is described. The final section of the chapter looks at the risk of bankruptcy facing shopkeepers and by contrast the opportunities of making money from shops. Detailed examination of the different shop trades, including description of stocks held, of the nature of the business done and of the degree of integration or separation between producing and retailing is the subject of Chapter 10. Much of the information for this had to be based on very miscellaneous evidence, only occasionally confirmed by the business records of retailers, but an overall picture of shop retailing nevertheless emerged. The thesis demonstrates firstly the possibility of providing at least some quantitative information on shop numbers from the late eighteenth century, and to a very limited extent from the early eighteenth century. This makes possible comparison of shop provision between towns and over time and can demonstrate the specific role of certain towns as shopping centres in the eighteenth century as well as suggesting rapid growth in shop numbers from about 1780, and even more rapid growth after the first decade or two of the nineteenth century. Although the figures produced have to be treated with caution, they imply that at least initially shop provision may not have kept up with growing demand in the most rapidly growing towns. However, it is equally clear that shops were widespread In the eighteenth century and that general provisions shops wore to be found in substantial numbers in towns before 1800. Secondly a pattern of service centres can be described, including not only market towns but also many villages in which shops were to be found. While market towns and their open markets remained of importance and indeed were probably expanding their facilities for the supply of perishable foods, the essential role of markets was complementary to that of shops and this complementarity was able to last well into the nineteenth century without hindering the development of fixed shop retailing. Although many of the major developments in retail organization almost certainly did take place in the period after that considered by this thesis, a final conclusion nust be that many changes were foreshadowed by 1815. In Chester at least there were by then a substantial number of specialist town centre shops, where commercial rather than manufacturing skills were the main attributes of the proprietor, where display and advertising were of considerable importance and perhaps even where the new ideas about ready money and fixed prices were beginning to be found. Both in terns of numbers and organization, the traditional chronology of shop development has almost certainly to be put back about fifty years in time, and probably much more than that with regard to the widespread existence of shops. It seems clear, at least from the evidence used for this thesis, that some innovations in retailing parallelled innovations in industry and that by 1815 retailing was already moving from a traditional to a modern structure. </p...|$|R
