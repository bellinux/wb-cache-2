50|$|Induction {{generators}} {{are often}} used in wind turbines and some micro hydro installations due {{to their ability to}} produce useful power at varying rotor speeds. Induction generators are mechanically and electrically simpler than other <b>generator</b> <b>types.</b> They are also more rugged, requiring no brushes or commutators.|$|R
50|$|Wind turbine {{manufacturers}} design, test, manufacture, {{and assist}} with the operation and maintenance of wind turbines. Important choices facing them include turbine design (<b>generator</b> <b>type,</b> gearbox vs. gear-less, materials) and how much control to maintain over component supplies (internal vs. external). They must be concerned with maintaining their extensive fleets of operating turbines {{while at the same}} time developing newer and ever-larger models. The largest wind turbine manufacturers are based in Denmark, Germany, Spain, India, and USA.|$|E
5000|$|Safe Harbor Dam, PA - The Safe Harbor Dam has two 28 MW, single phase, {{turbines}} {{dedicated to}} 25 Hz power generation. A 25 MW bi-directional motor <b>generator</b> <b>type</b> frequency converter is also installed. The total 25 Hz {{capacity of the}} dam is 81 MW.

5000|$|Buchla's instruments, {{such as the}} Music Easel (pictured), use a {{different}} method of timbre generation than Moog synthesizers. Moog units use oscillators with basic function <b>generator</b> <b>type</b> waveshapes and rely heavily on filtering with 24 dB resonant low-pass filters, while Buchlas are geared toward complex oscillators using frequency modulation, amplitude modulation, and dynamic waveshaping to produce other forms of timbre modulation. Many of Don Buchla's designs, including the Low-Pass Gates (later called Dynamic Managers) contain vactrols (photoresistive opto-isolators used as voltage-controlled potentiometers) that contributed to a very [...] "natural" [...] perception of Buchla sound.|$|E

Elution yields, chemical as well as radionuclidic and radiochemical purities, elution profiles along six months, were evaluated. Broad elution profile, high efficiency, with tandem alumina column added, ionic exchange column needed for increase of radionuclidic concentration were characteristics of <b>type</b> I <b>generators.</b> Easy handling with slightly lower yields and high concentrations of activity were observed in <b>type</b> II <b>generators.</b> Similar radionuclidic impurities namely 192 Ir, 191 Os, 188 W, 110 mAg, 54 Mn, 134 Cs and 60 Co as well as similar radiochemical yields obtained in the labelling of 188 Re-HEDP were observed with eluates of both <b>generator</b> <b>types.</b> Absorbed doses to radiopharmacy staff were less important in <b>type</b> II <b>generators.</b> Both <b>generator</b> <b>types</b> are adequate and useful considering their main product but reproducibility has to be improved to achieve clinical proficiency...|$|R

50|$|The second method uses {{computational}} algorithms {{that can}} produce long sequences of apparently random results, which are in fact completely determined by a shorter initial value, known as a seed value or key. As a result, the entire seemingly random sequence can be reproduced if the seed value is known. This type of random number generator is often called a pseudorandom number generator. This type of generator typically does not rely on sources of naturally occurring entropy, {{though it may be}} periodically seeded by natural sources. This <b>generator</b> <b>type</b> is non-blocking, so they are not rate-limited by an external event, making large bulk reads a possibility.|$|E
5000|$|The BTH <b>generator,</b> <b>type</b> RTB 15656, {{was rated}} as , 750/545 V, 1090/1500 A at 750 rpm, only {{slightly}} {{different from that}} used in the earlier Class 24s. (Note all Class 25 locomotives used a generator designated as BTH RTB 15656 but its rating and characteristics changed over time). The generator supplied four BTH 137BX traction motors connected in parallel and rated , 545 V, 375 A at 560 rpm with a gear ratio of 18:79 (to give a 90 mph maximum speed). Maximum tractive effort was 39000 lbf kN and continuous tractive effort was [...] at 17.1 mi/h km/h, the latter standard for all Class 25s. Power at rail was , now available between 9.3 and 77.6 mi/h km/h. For the first fifteen locomotives fuel capacity was 520 imp gal (design type 25 AV) and the final ten had larger 620 imp gal fuel tanks installed (design type 25 BV).|$|E
5000|$|In 82% of {{epilepsy}} {{patients the}} heart rate increases quickly and suddenly upon a seizure This is known as ictal tachycardia. Ictal tachycardia is so characteristic {{that it can be}} distinguished from the slow gradual increase of heart rate that occurs during physical activity. This way in the majority of epilepsy patients seizures can be detected in the ECG. In addition to classical VNS, some new VNS generators continuously monitor heart rate and identify fast and sudden heart rate increases associated with seizures with intelligent software. Then an automatic additional stimulation can be triggered to interrupt, prevent or alleviate the seizure. This new <b>generator</b> <b>type</b> was shown to detect and treat at least four out of five seizures and 60% of seizures were shown to be interrupted with this heart-rate triggered stimulation. The earlier {{in the course of the}} seizure the stimulation occurred the quicker the seizure ended generally seizures were shown to be reduced by around 35% by stimulation ...|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes an {{absorption}} {{refrigeration cycle}} device using a plate <b>type</b> <b>generator</b> {{in order to}} improve the start-up process to reduce the time to reach the steady state condition. A conventional absorption refrigeration cycle device using a shell&tube generator places a rectifier above the generator to remove absorbent from generated refrigerant vapor and to raise concentration of refrigerant vapor. However the replacement of a shell&tube <b>type</b> <b>generator</b> by a plate <b>type</b> <b>generator</b> makes it difficult to include the rectifier within an absorption refrigeration system. Therefore, the cycle proposed in the present study introduced a partial condenser instead of a rectifier. Refrigerant vapor in the partial condenser is cooled by coolant so that only absorbent within the generated vapor condenses by utilizing the difference of boiling temperature. Then, the analytical model was formulated in order to investigate the effectiveness of the plate <b>type</b> <b>generator.</b> The analytical results show that the start-up time is reduced with the plate <b>type</b> <b>generator...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} load factor, facility and <b>generator</b> <b>types</b> on the productivity of Korean electric power plants. In order to capture important differences in the effect of load policy on power output, we use a semiparametric smooth coefficient (SPSC) model {{that allows us to}} model heterogeneous performances across power plants and over time by allowing underlying technologies to be heterogeneous. The SPSC model accommodates both continuous and discrete covariates. Various specification tests are conducted to assess the performance of the SPSC model. Using a unique generator level panel dataset spanning the period 1995 - 2006, we find that the impact of load factor, <b>generator</b> and facility <b>types</b> on power generation varies substantially in terms of magnitude and significance across different plant characteristics. The results have strong implications for generation policy in Korea as outlined in this study...|$|R
