25|$|On 14 October 2006, Railway Minister Lalu Prasad waved off {{the flag}} for a 1962 WP 7200 model steam {{locomotive}} Ruby Queen {{and the seven}} carriages as part of SCR's ruby jubilee celebrations. On its inaugural run to Falaknuma, the <b>heritage</b> <b>train</b> had only one stop — Kachiguda. The 'queen' was enthusiastically received by people who gathered at the station on that day.To run 120km, the awesome beauty consumes just 15,000kg of coal and 25,000 litres of water. The highlight of that train was the 33-seater vice-regal coach RA 29, built in 1921, for the Prince of Wales on a State visit to India.|$|E

Corris No. 5 visited the Talyllyn Railway in 1983 and 1990, and No. 7 in October 2011.
