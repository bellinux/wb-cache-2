40|$|Humans {{experience}} {{the self as}} localized within their body. This aspect of bodily self-consciousness can be experimentally manipulated by exposing individuals to conflicting multisensory input, or can be abnormal following focal brain injury. Recent technological developments helped to unravel some of the mechanisms underlying multisensory integration and self-location, but the neural underpinnings are still under investigation, and the manual application of stimuli resulted in large variability difficult to control. This paper presents the development and evaluation of an MR-compatible <b>stroking</b> <b>device</b> capable of presenting moving tactile stimuli to both legs {{and the back of}} participants lying on a scanner bed while acquiring functional neuroimaging data. The platform consists of four independent <b>stroking</b> <b>devices</b> with a travel of 16 - 20 cm and a maximum stroking velocity of 15 cm/s, actuated over non-magnetic ultrasonic motors. Complemented with virtual reality, this setup provides a unique research platform allowing to investigate multisensory integration and its effects on self-location under well-controlled experimental conditions. The MR-compatibility of the system was evaluated in both a 3 and a 7 Tesla scanner and showed negligible interference with brain imaging. In a preliminary study using a prototype device with only one tactile stimulator, fMRI data acquired on 12 healthy participants showed visuo-tactile synchrony-related and body-specific modulations of the brain activity in bilateral temporoparietal cortex...|$|R
40|$|Acute ischemic strokes {{arising from}} {{blockages}} {{of the major}} brain-supplying arteries put patients at risk for extensive brain injury. Left untreated, these major strokes produce significant disability and death. Fortunately, recent advances in <b>stroke</b> <b>devices</b> have improved clinical outcomes in such patients, provided that they are treated early enough after their stroke onset. Using minimally invasive techniques, these devices are delivered through the arteries using catheters in order to remove the thrombus, or blood clot, that is blocking {{blood flow to the}} brain. However, further progress is needed, as approximately half of the major stroke patients who are treated in this way remain dependent or dead at 3 months after their stroke. In particular, a better understanding of which patients are likely to benefit from intervention is crucial. This thesis investigates the role of brain imaging to improve patient selection. Part I examines the use of various imaging approaches to identify those stroke patients who have already suffered large areas of brain injury, and as a result are unlikely to do well after treatment. Excluding such patients will improve the risk-benefit profile of stroke intervention and make treatment more cost effective. Part II explores the emerging field of thrombus imaging and the impact of thrombus characteristics on outcomes after intervention. Through this work, advances in <b>stroke</b> <b>devices</b> and procedural techniques can be targeted to the most difficult to treat thrombi. The thesis concludes with a discussion of the key research questions on the horizon...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Approximately 900, 000 {{people in}} England {{live with the}} effects of stroke (NICE 2010). Health {{behaviour}} modification can be crucial in stroke rehabilitation. Local stakeholders identified a problem of increased numbers of patients experiencing long term weight <b>gain</b> following a <b>stroke.</b> Method: Mixed method study incorporating i) survey of South Yorkshire Health Cohort participants (n= 87); ii) interviews with staff (n= 18) and stroke patients (n= 10). Data analysed using framework analysis. Results: Weight <b>gain</b> post <b>stroke</b> is not monitored routinely and prevalence is therefore unknown. Findings from this study indicate that post-stroke weight gain is a problem for some people. Contributing factors identified include social isolation, depression and loss of control in cognition and communication affecting ability to manage diet and weight. Ambiguity was seen to arise because weight <b>gain</b> following <b>stroke</b> can be both a sign of progress and of a problem. Results indicate fragmented communication between health care professionals across care pathways limits opportunities to address weight gain. Additional limiting factors include limited availability of specialist support and funding cuts to community based services. Conclusion: Health care professionals need to be mindful of the risk of long term weight <b>gain</b> following <b>stroke.</b> Whether in acute, intermediate, rehabilitation or primary care settings, systems should be in place to identify opportunities for advice and support regarding diet and physical activity by, for example, embracing initiatives such as Making Every Contact Count (MECC). A large cohort study would provide population based data on prevalence and causes of weight <b>gain</b> following a <b>stroke...</b>|$|R

Results indicate that seat attenuators vastly reduce occupant lumbar loads in crash scenarios. Moreover, analysis has shown that the introduction of forward sliding seats coupled with seat attenuators improved occupant safety by translating crash loads to the forward axis, reducing vertical loads. Finally, the introduction of airbags was found to increase the available space for <b>stroking</b> <b>devices,</b> improving energy absorption of the safety system and acted to reduce the potential for hard contact between the occupant and instrument panel...|$|R

40|$|Stroke is {{the leading}} cause of long term {{disability}} and third leading cause of death (Curioni et al, 2009). Survival rates are increasing. Approximately 900, 000 people in England live with the effects of a stroke (NICE 2010). Health behaviour modification can be crucial in stroke rehabilitation and in avoiding long term impairment. Consultation with stakeholders identified increased numbers of patients experiencing long term weight <b>gain</b> following a <b>stroke.</b> This study aims to explore i) the existence of weight <b>gain</b> following a <b>stroke</b> ii) factors contributing to weight gain and iii) implications for the stroke rehabilitation pathway. A mixed method study incorporating i) a survey of South Yorkshire Health Cohort participants (n= 87); ii) interviews with staff (n= 18) and stroke patients (n= 10). Data were analysed using framework analysis methods. Across the care pathway inconsistencies exist in the recognition that weight gain is an issue for patients post stroke. The findings draw on components of the Theory of Integrated Care (Kodner & Spreeuwenberg, 2002). Applying the theory to the findings provides a means to explain how patients may become lost across the different aspects of the stroke care pathway. Fragmented communication between health care professionals across the pathway limits opportunities to address the risks and realities of weight gain. Ambiguity arises for patients because weight <b>gain</b> following a <b>stroke</b> can be both a sign of progress and of a problem. Individualising care and integration of weight management advice across the whole pathway (acute, community and primary care settings) may prevent weight <b>gain</b> in <b>stroke</b> survivors. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} design methodologies {{for construction}} of an actuator that uses smart materials to provide hydraulic fluid power. In the class of actuators described, hydraulic fluid decouples the operating frequency of the output cylinder from the drive frequency of the piezoelectric or other smart material. This decoupling allows the piezoelectric to be driven at high frequency, to extract {{the maximum amount of}} energy from the material, and the hydraulic cylinder to be driven at low frequencies to provide long stroke. However, due to fluid compressibility and structural compliance, the fundamental impedance match between the fluid and the piezoelectric make it difficult to convert energy from the piezoelectric into pressurized hydraulic fluid flow. The basic design tradeoffs and major technical issues are discussed in the areas of materials, mechanical design, and fluid-mechanical interface. Prototype devices and component measurements are presented. Test methods are described, and test results quantifying pump pressure and flow, and actuator force and velocity are summarized. The series of tests show the potential of these devices for high force long <b>stroke</b> <b>devices</b> powered by smart materials...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Reducing {{the burden}} of stroke is a {{priority}} for the Veterans Affairs Health System, reflected by {{the creation of the}} Veterans Affairs Stroke Quality Enhancement Research Initiative. To inform the initiative's strategic planning, we estimated the relative population-level impact and efficiency of distinct approaches to improving stroke care in the US Veteran population to inform policy and practice. METHODS: A System Dynamics stroke model of the Veteran population was constructed to evaluate the relative impact of 15 intervention scenarios including both broad and targeted primary and secondary prevention and acute care/rehabilitation on cumulative (20 years) outcomes including quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) <b>gained,</b> <b>strokes</b> prevented, stroke fatalities prevented, and the number-needed-to-treat per QALY gained. RESULTS: At the population level, a broad hypertension control effort yielded the largest increase in QALYs (35, 517), followed by targeted prevention addressing hypertension and anticoagulation among Veterans with prior cardiovascular disease (27, 856) and hypertension control among diabetics (23, 100). Adjusting QALYs gained by the number of Veterans needed to treat, thrombolytic therapy with tissue-type plasminogen activator was most efficient, needing 3. 1 Veterans to be treated per QALY gained. This was followed by rehabilitation (3. 9) and targeted prevention addressing hypertension and anticoagulation among those with prior cardiovascular disease (5. 1). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the ranking of interventions was robust to uncertainty in input parameter values. CONCLUSIONS: Prevention strategies tend to have larger population impacts, though interventions targeting specific high-risk groups tend to be more efficient in terms of number-needed-to-treat per QALY gained...|$|R

40|$|Background: Transcatheter {{closure of}} secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) is {{nowadays}} the main treatment option in many centers worldwide. In symptomatic infants or {{in those with}} certain comorbidities, {{there is a need}} for early intervention. Limited data are available about the procedural safety in infants below 15 kg of weight. Methods: Retrospective review of all patients referred to our center for ASD closure by device between January 1998 and November 2014. Major complications included death, cardiac or respiratory arrest, <b>stroke,</b> <b>device</b> embolization and erosion, need for emergency surgery or recatheterisation due to other procedure-related complications, significant pleural/pericardial effusion requiring intervention, persistent arrhythmia or intraprocedural arrhythmia requiring cardioversion/ resuscitation, postprocedural significant valvular insufficiency or pulmonary vein obstruction, need for transfusion due to significant bleeding, and permanent vein thrombosis. Minor complications included transient arrhythmia, significant access site hematoma, transient vein thrombosis, transient limb paresthesis, and development of postprocedural infection occurring within 48 hours. Data were retrieved from the hospital's database and from the Swedish Registry for Congenital Heart Disease (Swedcon). Results: In total, 244 cases with age 15 kg, there were 6 major (one death related to device erosion in a 17 -year female with 26 mm ASD and absent retroaortic rim, surgical removal of device, arrhythmia requiring conversion in 2 patients, and need of transfusion) and 4 minor complications (transient arrhythmia).

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThis study {{investigated}} whether patients with patent foramen ovale (PFO) {{have an increased}} risk of stroke due to permanent pacemaker (PPM) /implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation. BackgroundData are lacking on the risk of stroke in patients with PFO and implantable intracardiac devices, either a PPM or an ICD. We investigated whether patients with PFO have increased risk of stroke due to PPM/ICD implantation. MethodsBetween 2001 and 2008, 2, 921 consecutive patients with PFO (67. 5 Â± 16. 4 years of age, 52. 2 % male) were identified from our echocardiography database. These patients were divided into a device group (patients had PPM/ICD implantation for any reason after receiving a diagnosis of PFO) and a no device group (patients did not have PPM or ICD implantation). Patients who had PFO closure during follow-up were excluded. Both groups were matched for baseline characteristics and medications. The incidence of ischemic stroke was assessed in each group after propensity score matching (case:control ratio of 1 : 1 yielding 231 pairs). All patients completed at least 4 years of follow-up until MayÂ  2012. ResultsThere were 2, 690 patients in the n device group (67. 3 Â± 16. 4 years of age, 51. 6 % male) and 231 patients in the device group (75. 4 Â± 14. 6 years of age, 59. 3 % male). Six patients (2. 6 %) in the no device group and 6 (2. 6 %) in the device group had a stroke during the follow-up period. No difference in the rate of stroke, transient ischemic stroke, or stroke/transient ischemic stroke was observed between the 2 groups. ConclusionsThe risk of stroke in patients with PFO and an implantable intracardiac device is similar to those without an intracardiac device. In patients with PFO, without a history of <b>stroke,</b> <b>device</b> implantation might not be considered aÂ risk factor for future stroke occurrence...|$|R
