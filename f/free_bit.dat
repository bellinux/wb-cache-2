Every escape route devised by the crew leads to {{dangerous}} battles with the Hazari.

Janeway seems pleased with the solution, until she is informed by Kurros that they would also like Seven as part of their payment.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a cost efficient technique to protect embedded processors register file against multiple bit faults. The proposed technique provides {{high level of}} protection for register file against MBUs incurring low amount of area and power overheads. The proposed technique is motivated {{by the fact that}} not all data stored in the register file occupy full register width. The key idea behind the proposed technique is to exploit these unused bits for fault detection/correction purposes. In fact, in the proposed technique, based on the available <b>free</b> <b>bits</b> in a register, an appropriate error detection/correction code is employed. To achieve the goal, three bits have been added to each register showing the register data width or available <b>free</b> <b>bits</b> in the register. To correct the errors, parity bit and hamming code is used in the proposed technique. The proposed technique is extensively evaluated on an ARM embedded processor IP core using fault injection experiments. The fault injection results show that the proposed technique can detect 99 % of errors in which 22 % of errors can also be corrected in the presence of up to 16 bit errors. The proposed technique imposes about 7 % area and 1 % power overheads. However, the remarkable fault detection/correction provided by the proposed technique a viable solution to cope with multiple bit faults in spite of its rather high power consumption and area overheads.

40|$|Adaptive routing {{algorithm}} {{has been}} employed in multichip interconnection networks {{in order to}} improve network performance. Does a algorithm use local or global network state? This is the key question in adaptive routing. In many traffic patterns, the ignorance of global network state, leading to routing selection based only on local congestion information, tends to violate global load balance. To attack the load balance issue in adapting routing, some global adaptive routing algorithms introduce a congestion propagation network to obtain global network status information, such as Regional Congestion Awareness (RCA) and Destination Based Adaptive Routing (DBAR). However, the congestion propagation network leads to additional power and area consumption which cannot be ignored. From another view, if we just increase the bandwidth between neighbor nodes with the wires used to build the congestion propagation network, the network performance could be improved as well. In this paper, we propose a global adaptive routing algorithm without employing the additional congestion propagation network. Our algorithm obtains the global network state in a novel way, and can offer significant improvement than the base-line local adaptive routing algorithm (xy-adaptive algorithm which selects routing based on local congestion information in each hop) for both medium and high injection rates. In wormhole flow control, all the routing information (flit id, source node id, destination node id, vc id and address) is contained in head flit, and data is carried in body flits. As a result, there are always many <b>free</b> <b>bits</b> in the head flit, especially when the bandwidth is 128 -bits which is normal in interconnection network design. Then, we can use these <b>free</b> <b>bits</b> in the head flit to propagate global congestion information but not increase the number of flits...|$|R

For such a case, we replace the pixel p_k in F by some ways, p_k+ 1 or p_k- 1 or p_k+ 3 or p_k - 3 {{so that in}} the new vector V_F the new LSB v_k of p_k is flipped. In the case V_F is not changed, we can remain F or change any pixel p_k by the new p_k+ 2 or p_k- 2 so that V_F is not changed. By this ways, any given 3 -bit string d can be embedded in F(new) since from V_F we can extract d by the method given above. The complicated situation of choosing which changes, p_k by p_k+ 1 or p_k- 1, p_k+ 3, p_k - 3, p_k+ 2, p_k- 2, is taken carefully so that we can embed one more bit d_ 4 in F, for any <b>free</b> <b>bit</b> d_ 4.

40|$|The {{register}} file is {{a critical}} component in a modern superscalar processor. It must {{be large enough to}} accommodate the results of all in-flight instructions. It must also have enough ports to allow simultaneous issue and writeback of many values each cycle. However, this makes {{it one of the most}} energy-consuming structures within the processor with a high access latency.

This increases the pipeline depth, lowering performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel use of compiler analysis to aid register caching. Adding a register cache allows us to preserve single-cycle register accesses, maintaining performance and reducing energy consumption.

40|$|Being able {{to predict}} or {{anticipate}} instructions that will be executed can help increase processor performance. For instance, static or dynamic branch prediction techniques— which respectively have limited efficiency and require silicon area—can be used to reach this goal. The principle of our approach {{is based on the}} sharing of tasks both at the compilation time by the assembler and dynamically at the hardware level. The main idea is to extract, at the compilation time from the assembly source code, relevant information from a hardware viewpoint and transmit it to the hardware through common but tuned Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs) for various purposes, such as selecting the more suitable branch predictor, saving silicon area or even reducing critical timing paths identified by the microarchitects. This approach implies a symbiosis between the assembler for the encoding of the information within the instruction and the hardware which needs appropriate logic to take advantage of that information.

In this paper, a divide-and-conquer strategy is introduced with an optimal scheme of grouping the 64 steps of operation into five stages of independent condition fulfillment, and a feasible collision differential propagation is optimally characterized as a guide to select those 1 - 3 -bit weak input differences, with their computational costs estimated. As a result, hundreds of thousands of weak input differences have been found, quite a number of which are superior to Wang et al’s. For example, a new differential collision attack with only 1 -MSB input difference is developed with a time complexity of 2 20. 96 MD 5 compressions, two weak input differences are able to find a collision within 2 10 MD 5 compressions. In particular, a 2 -bit weak input difference is found to be able to construct a practical 1 -block collision attack on MD 5.
