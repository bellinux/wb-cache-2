5|$|The {{utility of}} Feynman {{diagrams}} {{is that other}} types of physical phenomena {{that are part of}} the <b>general</b> <b>picture</b> of fundamental interactions but are conceptually separate from forces can also be described using the same rules. For example, a Feynman diagram can describe in succinct detail how a neutron decays into an electron, proton, and neutrino, an interaction mediated by the same gauge boson that is responsible for the weak nuclear force.|$|E
5|$|In a {{study of}} Ottoman {{registers}} of the early Ottoman rule of Palestine, Bernard Lewis reports:he first half century of Ottoman rule brought {{a sharp increase in}} population. The towns grew rapidly, villages became larger and more numerous, and there was an extensive development of agriculture, industry, and trade. The two last were certamly helped to no small extent by the influx of Spanish and other Western Jews. From the mass of detail in the registers, it is possible to extract something like a <b>general</b> <b>picture</b> of the economic life of the country in that period. Out of a total population of about 300,000 souls, between a fifth and a quarter lived in the six towns of Jerusalem, Gaza, Safed, Nablus, Ramle, and Hebron. The remainder consisted mainly of peasants, living in villages of varying size, and engaged in agriculture. Their main food-crops were wheat and barley in that order, supplemented by leguminous pulses, olives, fruit, and vegetables. In and around most of the towns there was a considerable number of vineyards, orchards, and vegetable gardens.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{the authors}} of the New Testament showed little {{interest}} in an absolute chronology of Jesus or in synchronizing the episodes of his life with the secular history of the age. As stated in , the gospels do not claim to provide an exhaustive list of the events in the life of Jesus. The accounts were primarily written as theological documents in the context of early Christianity, with timelines as a secondary consideration. In this respect, it is noteworthy that the Gospels devote about one third of their text to the last week of the life of Jesus in Jerusalem, referred to as the Passion. Although the gospels do not provide enough details to satisfy the demands of modern historians regarding exact dates, it is possible to draw from them a <b>general</b> <b>picture</b> of the life story of Jesus.|$|E

5|$|It {{has also}} been {{suggested}} that the atrocities that Las Casas described were exaggerated or even invented, {{but this is not}} generally considered likely as Las Casas was far from the only person to be deeply worried about abuse and mistreatment of the Indians. The Dominican friars Antonio de Montesinos and Pedro de Córdoba had reported extensive violence already {{in the first decade of}} the conquest of the Indies, and throughout the conquest of the Americas there were reports of abuse of the natives by friars and priests and ordinary citizens, and many massacres of indigenous people were reported in full by those who perpetrated them. Even some of Las Casas's enemies, such as Toribio de Benavente Motolinia, reported many gruesome atrocities committed against the Indians by the colonizers. All in all, modern historians tend to disregard the numerical figures given by Las Casas, but maintain that the <b>general</b> <b>picture</b> he presented of an intensely violent and abusive conquest did represent reality.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of grey jays live {{where there is a}} strong presence of black spruce (Picea mariana), white spruce (P. glauca), Engelmann spruce (P. engelmanni), jack pine (Pinus banksiana), or lodgepole pine (P. contorta). Grey jays do not inhabit the snowy, coniferous, and therefore seemingly appropriate Sierra Nevada of California where no spruce occur. Nor do grey jays live in lower elevations of coastal Alaska or British Columbia dominated by Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis). The key habitat requirements may be sufficiently cold temperatures to ensure successful storage of perishable food and tree bark with sufficiently pliable scales arranged in a shingle-like configuration that allows grey jays to wedge food items easily up into dry, concealed storage locations. Storage may also be assisted by the antibacterial properties of the bark and foliage of boreal tree species. An exception to this <b>general</b> <b>picture</b> may be the well-marked subspecies P. c. obscurus. It lives right down to the coast from Washington to northern California in the absence of cold temperatures or the putatively necessary tree species.|$|E

25|$|In the {{discussion}} of special relativity, forces played {{no more than a}} background role. Special relativity assumes the ability to define inertial frames that fill all of spacetime, all of whose clocks run {{at the same rate as}} the clock at the origin. Is this really possible? In a nonuniform gravitational field, experiment dictates that the answer is no. Gravitational fields make it impossible to construct a global inertial frame. In small enough regions of spacetime, local inertial frames are still possible. General relativity involves the systematic stitching together of these local frames into a more <b>general</b> <b>picture</b> of spacetime.|$|E

25|$|Cleckley draws {{important}} {{distinctions between}} the psychopath and non-psychopathic criminal. He states that the psychopath very seldom takes much advantage of any gain, has an obscure or inconsistent purpose, usually puts himself unnecessarily in a shameful position as much as causing trouble for others; and usually does not commit the most serious or violent crimes, but usually does end up harming himself. However, despite the <b>general</b> <b>picture</b> of weak-willed and inconsistent antisocial behavior, he also states, at least in later editions, that some may develop drives towards the most serious or sadistic crimes. He suggests this is a somewhat separate additional pathology but does not explain why or how.|$|E

25|$|The Luftwaffe's <b>general</b> <b>picture</b> of the VVS {{was entirely}} correct in many aspects in the {{military}} field; this was later confirmed {{in the early stages}} of Barbarossa and in post-war British and American studies, and also in the Eastern Bloc. Soviet sources confirm that the VVS was in a state of reorganisation before the attack, and were retraining on modern machines which made it unready for a major conflict. The deductions about Soviet tactical-operational limitations were to a large degree, accurate. In aircraft types, equipment and training, ground organisation, supply system at the operational level, the dispersal of effort and the operational commands immobility, gave the impression of an air force with limited striking power.|$|E

500|$|Historians {{are divided}} {{over whether the}} {{deception}} {{played a major role}} in the German response. Most, such as historian Ben McIntyre, agree that Ironside added to the <b>general</b> <b>picture</b> of confusion for the German commanders.

500|$|In Scotland, the Celtic Iron Age way of life, often troubled {{but never}} {{extinguished}} by Rome, re-asserted itself when the legions abandoned any permanent occupation in 211 AD. Hanson (2003) writes: [...] "For many {{years it has}} been almost axiomatic in studies of the period that the Roman conquest must have had some major medium or long-term impact on Scotland. On present evidence that cannot be substantiated either in terms of environment, economy, or, indeed, society. The impact {{appears to have been}} very limited. The <b>general</b> <b>picture</b> remains one of broad continuity, not of disruption... The Roman presence in Scotland {{was little more than a}} series of brief interludes within a longer continuum of indigenous development." [...] The Romans' direct impact on the Highlands and Islands was scant and there is no evidence that they ever actually landed in the Outer Hebrides.|$|E

In {{regard to}} Final Fantasy VIII, Uematsu did not {{prefer to use}} multiple sources to find MIDI instruments—"I could be {{coming up with a}} great melody in the very moment"—instead using a Roland SC-88 synthesizer for the entire score.

He could not express a character's emotions solely with plot, instead using images of appearance and attire—"It's important to know when their emotions are at their height, but it usually takes until a month before release for them to finish the ending dialog...!" [...] In response to a question by IGN music stating that the music of Final Fantasy VIII was very dark and perhaps influenced by the plot of the game, Uematsu stated [...] "the atmosphere of music varies depending on story line, of course, but it's also my intention to put various types of music into one game".|$|E

500|$|The Canadian {{historian}} Elliot Rose {{suggested that}} the reason that Murray's theory gained such support was partly because of her [...] "imposing credentials" [...] {{as a member of}} staff at UCL, a position that lent her theory greater legitimacy {{in the eyes of many}} readers. He further {{suggested that the}} Murrayite view was attractive to many as it confirmed [...] "the <b>general</b> <b>picture</b> of pre-Christian Europe a reader of Frazer or [...] Graves would be familiar with". Similarly, Hutton suggested that the cause of the Murrayite theory's popularity was because it [...] "appealed to so many of the emotional impulses of the age", including [...] "the notion of the English countryside as a timeless place full of ancient secrets", the literary popularity of Pan, the widespread belief that the majority of British had remained pagan long after the process of Christianisation, and the idea that folk customs represented pagan survivals. At the same time, Hutton suggested, it seemed more plausible to many than the previously dominant rationalist idea that the witch trials were the result of mass delusion. Related to this, the folklorist Jacqueline Simpson suggested that part of the Murrayite theory's appeal was that it appeared to give a [...] "sensible, demystifying, liberating approach to a longstanding but sterile argument" [...] between the rationalists who denied that there had been any witches and those, like Montague Summers, who insisted that there had been a real Satanic conspiracy against Christendom in the Early Modern period replete with witches with supernatural powers. [...] "How refreshing", noted the historian Hilda Ellis Davidson, [...] "and exciting her first book was at that period. A new approach, and such a surprising one." ...|$|E
