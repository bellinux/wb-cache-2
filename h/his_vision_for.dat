While there, he met a young Scottish actress, Susan Couper Black, who used the stage name Helen Lenoir. She became fascinated by <b>his</b> <b>vision</b> <b>for</b> {{establishing}} a company to promote English comic opera and gave up her next engagement to join his theatrical organisation as his secretary. Well-educated, with an organisational ability, business acumen, focus on detail and diplomatic skills that surpassed even Carte's, Lenoir gradually became intensely involved {{in all of his}} business affairs. Carte and Lenoir married in 1888, three years {{after the death of his}} first wife.|$|E

5|$|The {{final years}} of Bahá'u'lláh's life (1879–1892) were spent in the Mansion of Bahjí, just outside Acre, {{even though he was}} still {{formally}} a prisoner of the Ottoman Empire. During his years in Acre and Bahjí, since `Abdu'l-Bahá, his eldest son, had taken care of the organizational work, Bahá'u'lláh was able to devote his time to writing, and he produced many volumes of work including the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, his book of laws. His other works included letters outlining <b>his</b> <b>vision</b> <b>for</b> a united world, as well as the need for ethical action; he also composed many prayers.|$|E

The four producers felt it was best to pattern the film's development after that of Superman (1978). Uslan, Melniker and Guber pitched Batman to Universal Pictures, but the studio turned it down. The project was publicly announced with a budget of $15 million in July 1980 at the Comic Art Convention in New York. Casablanca FilmWorks was absorbed into PolyGram Pictures in 1980. Guber and Peters left PolyGram Pictures in 1982 and took the Batman film rights with them, although PolyGram would retain at least 7.5% of the profits of said rights due to a contractual agreement. Guber and Peters immediately set up shop at Warner Bros., which finally decided to accept Batman.|$|E

5|$|Bruce {{pushed for}} greater {{consultation}} and {{voice for the}} dominions, and succeeded in having Richard Casey appointed as a permanent political liaison in London who would have access to British government decisions and act as a conduit between Westminster and Melbourne. He also successfully lobbied {{for the creation of}} a Dominion Office separated out from the Colonial Office to acknowledge the different state of affairs that now existed in the Empire. However, while fellow dominions generally agreed that the imperial system should be modified, not all shared <b>his</b> <b>vision</b> <b>for</b> closer collaboration and strong ties. Canada and the Union of South Africa were instead seeking greater independence from London, and there was little enthusiasm for many of Bruce's more ambitious plans for inter-empire trade and policy cooperation.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the film}} was {{announced}} on 20 December 2008, although writer Alex Garland had begun working on the script in 2006. British studio DNA Films produced the film, and partnered with sales agency IM Global to sell the worldwide distribution rights. By May 2010, this partnership saw IM Global and its owner Reliance Big Pictures agree to co-finance the 3-D project with a $45 million production budget, and a schedule to begin filming in Johannesburg, South Africa in late 2010. Pete Travis was named as the film's director and Garland, Andrew Macdonald and Allon Reich would produce it. Duncan Jones had previously been offered the role of director. In a 2010 interview, Jones said that <b>his</b> <b>vision</b> <b>for</b> the film was unconventional—describing it as weird, dark, and funny—and it did not mesh well with Garland's script. In September 2010, {{it was reported that}} the film would be titled Dredd.|$|E
5|$|In April, Sakanaction {{had already}} started making songs for Shin-shiro, despite having just {{finished}} their tour in March for the band's second album Night Fishing, which had been released in January of the same year. The album's production took {{a different approach to}} how Go to the Future and Night Fishing were produced. In their previous albums Yamaguchi produced the song demos, then took them to the studio and explained <b>his</b> <b>vision</b> <b>for</b> each song; creating them in sessions with all of the band members. For Shin-shiro, Yamaguchi created the songs, and then assigned each member of the band to create a demo based on their two-person vision. This was a conscious move by Yamaguchi to create a new sound for the album, figuring that if all of members were concurrently working on the songs, it was inevitable that one person would take charge of each song.|$|E

5|$|Braid was {{originally}} {{developed as a}} Windows title with possible console versions, though Blow was not committed to releasing either a PC or console version first. Blow signed up with Microsoft to release the game on Xbox Live in mid-2007, with that version officially announced at the 2007 Tokyo Game Show. Blow was critical of the Xbox Live certification process, as he believed the effort to meet all the requirements could have been better spent on polishing the game. At the same time, the certification team allowed him to retain certain aspects of <b>his</b> <b>vision</b> <b>for</b> the game that were otherwise contrary to the process, including giving the player immediate control of the game instead of requiring a start-up title screen. Microsoft also requested that Blow include some additional hints to the player based on results of playtesting, but Blow held his ground, refusing to release the game if {{he was forced to}} add these. He said he would likely not release a game again on the Xbox Live service under the same business model. Blow later released a Braid theme for Xbox Live; though he wanted to release this theme for free, Microsoft required the theme to be priced at a nominal level.|$|E
5|$|In November 2008, after Sakurai {{was given}} the go-ahead to develop Uprising, he rented out an office in Takadanobaba, a {{district}} of Tokyo. At this stage, due to the game's platform still being in early development, there were no development tools available for Sakurai to use. Between November and March 2009, Sakurai finalized <b>his</b> <b>vision</b> <b>for</b> the game. During this period, to help design the game's settings and characters, Sakurai hired several outside illustrators to work on concept art: these artists were Toshio Noguchi, Akifumi Yamamoto and Masaki Hirooka. The art style was inspired by manga. In January 2009, development studio Project Sora was established for Uprisings development. At its inception, it had a staff of 30. With the start of active recruitment in March 2009, the game officially entered development: at the time, {{it was the very}} first game to be in development for the new platform. During this early stage, {{due to the lack of}} platform specific development tools, the team were developing the game on Wii hardware and personal computers. The changing specifications of the developing hardware resulted in multiple features undergoing major revisions. This hardware instability led to a protracted development cycle: in the event, the team managed to fully utilize the platform's capabilities, doing detailed work on how many enemies they could show on the screen at any one time. Debugging also took a long time due to the size and variability of gameplay built into Uprising.|$|E
