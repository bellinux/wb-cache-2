5|$|<b>Endocrine</b> {{conditions}} often {{present with}} cutaneous findings as the skin {{interacts with the}} <b>endocrine</b> system in many ways.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} <b>endocrine</b> {{diseases}} involve dysfunctions of the adrenal gland. Overproduction of cortisol leads to Cushing's syndrome, whereas insufficient production {{is associated with}} Addison's disease. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a genetic disease produced by dysregulation of <b>endocrine</b> control mechanisms. A variety of tumors can arise from adrenal tissue and are commonly found in medical imaging when searching for other diseases.|$|E
5|$|For {{those with}} <b>endocrine</b> issues (low levels of thyrotopin , {{follicle}} stimulating hormone) drug therapy is recommended.|$|E
5|$|A 2004 {{statement}} by the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology and the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric <b>Endocrine</b> Society (for children) uses slightly different cutoffs, where mild DKA is defined by pH7.20–7.30 (bicarbonate 10–15mmol/l), moderate DKA by pH7.1–7.2 (bicarbonate 5–10) and severe DKA by pH<7.1 (bicarbonate below 5).|$|E
5|$|Non-reproductive health {{remains an}} {{important}} predictor of maternal health. In the United States, the {{leading causes of}} maternal death are cardiovascular disease (15% of deaths), <b>endocrine,</b> respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders, infection, hemorrhage and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (Gronowski and Schindler, Table II).|$|E
5|$|Physiology is {{the study}} the {{interaction}} of how, for example, the nervous, immune, <b>endocrine,</b> respiratory, and circulatory systems, function and interact. The study of these systems is shared with such medically oriented disciplines as neurology and immunology.|$|E
5|$|Selenium deficiency, {{defined by}} low (<60% of normal) {{selenoenzyme}} activity levels in brain and <b>endocrine</b> tissues, occurs {{only when a}} low selenium level is linked with an additional stress, such as high exposures to mercury or increased oxidant stress from vitamin E deficiency.|$|E
5|$|While the {{mutagenic}} and genotoxic {{effects of}} TCDD are sometimes disputed and sometimes confirmed it does foster {{the development of}} cancer. Its main action in causing cancer is cancer promotion; it promotes the carcinogenicity initiated by other compounds. Very high doses may, in addition, cause cancer indirectly; one of the proposed mechanisms is oxidative stress and the subsequent oxygen damage to DNA. There are other explanations such as <b>endocrine</b> disruption or altered signal transduction. The <b>endocrine</b> disrupting activities seem {{to be dependent on}} life stage, being anti-estrogenic when estrogen is present (or in high concentration) in the body, and estrogenic in the absence of estrogen.|$|E
5|$|Human {{activities}} have affected stocks of {{many species of}} teleost, through overfishing, pollution and global warming. Among many recorded instances, overfishing caused the complete collapse of the Atlantic cod population off Newfoundland in 1992, leading to Canada's indefinite closure of the fishery. Pollution, especially in rivers and along coasts, has harmed teleosts as sewage, pesticides and herbicides have entered the water. Many pollutants, such as heavy metals, organochlorines, and carbamates interfere with teleost reproduction, often by disrupting their <b>endocrine</b> systems. In the roach, river pollution has caused the intersex condition, in which an individual's gonads contain both cells that can make male gametes (such as spermatogonia) and cells that can make female gametes (such as oogonia). Since <b>endocrine</b> disruption also affects humans, teleosts are used to indicate the presence of such chemicals in water. Water pollution caused local extinction of teleost populations in many northern European lakes {{in the second half}} of the twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|Hypothyroidism, {{also called}} underactive thyroid or low thyroid, {{is a common}} {{disorder}} of the <b>endocrine</b> {{system in which the}} thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone. It can cause a number of symptoms, such as poor ability to tolerate cold, a feeling of tiredness, constipation, depression, and weight gain. Occasionally there may be swelling of the front part of the neck due to goitre. Untreated hypothyroidism during pregnancy can lead to delays in growth and intellectual development in the baby, which is called cretinism.|$|E
5|$|In larval lampreys, {{the thyroid}} {{originates}} as an exocrine gland, secreting its hormones into the gut, and {{associated with the}} larva's filter-feeding apparatus. In the adult lamprey, the gland separates from the gut, and becomes <b>endocrine,</b> but this path of development may reflect the evolutionary origin of the thyroid. For instance, the closest living relatives of vertebrates, the tunicates and Amphioxus, have a structure {{very similar to that}} of larval lampreys (the endostyle), and this also secretes iodine-containing compounds (albeit not thyroxine).|$|E
5|$|Obesity is most {{commonly}} {{caused by a}} combination of excessive food intake, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility. A few cases are caused primarily by genes, <b>endocrine</b> disorders, medications, or mental disorder. The view that obese people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow metabolism is not generally supported. On average, obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their normal counterparts due to the energy required to maintain an increased body mass.|$|E
5|$|Other {{heavy metals}} noted for their {{potentially}} hazardous nature, usually as toxic environmental pollutants, include manganese (central nervous system damage); cobalt and nickel (carcinogens); copper, zinc, selenium and silver (<b>endocrine</b> disruption, congenital disorders, or general toxic effects in fish, plants, birds, or other aquatic organisms); tin, as organotin (central nervous system damage); antimony (a suspected carcinogen); and thallium (central nervous system damage).|$|E
5|$|Parathyroid glands {{are small}} <b>endocrine</b> glands {{in the neck}} of humans and other {{tetrapods}} that produce parathyroid hormone. Humans usually have four parathyroid glands, variably located {{on the back of}} the thyroid gland. Parathyroid hormone and calcitonin (one of the hormones made by the thyroid gland) have key roles in regulating the amount of calcium in the blood and within the bones.|$|E
5|$|Postovulatory follicles are {{structures}} formed after oocyte release; they do {{not have}} <b>endocrine</b> function, present a wide irregular lumen, and are rapidly reabsorbed in a process involving the apoptosis of follicular cells. A degenerative process called follicular atresia reabsorbs vitellogenic oocytes not spawned. This process can also occur, but less frequently, in oocytes in other development stages.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} (also known as suprarenal glands) are <b>endocrine</b> glands that produce {{a variety of}} hormones {{including}} adrenaline and the steroids aldosterone and cortisol. They are found above the kidneys. Each gland has an outer cortex which produces steroid hormones and an inner medulla. The adrenal cortex itself {{is divided into three}} zones: zona glomerulosa, the zona fasciculata and the zona reticularis.|$|E
5|$|The genes {{often found}} mutated in PanNETs are {{different}} from those in exocrine pancreatic cancer. For example, KRAS mutation is normally absent. Instead, hereditary MEN1 gene mutations give rise to MEN1 syndrome, in which primary tumors occur in two or more <b>endocrine</b> glands. About 40–70% of people born with a MEN1 mutation eventually develop a PanNet. Other genes that are frequently mutated include DAXX, mTOR and ATRX.|$|E
5|$|The {{next most}} common type, acinar cell {{carcinoma}} of the pancreas, arises in the clusters of cells that produce these enzymes, and represents 5% of exocrine pancreas cancers. Like the 'functioning' <b>endocrine</b> cancers described below, acinar cell carcinomas may cause over-production of certain molecules, in this case digestive enzymes, which may cause symptoms such as skin rashes and joint pain.|$|E
5|$|The {{pancreatic}} islets {{make up the}} <b>endocrine</b> part of the pancreas, and synthesize and secrete hormones including insulin {{into the}} bloodstream. There {{is evidence that the}} beta cells in the islets that synthesize insulin contain dopamine receptors, and that dopamine acts {{to reduce the amount of}} insulin they release. The source of their dopamine input is not clearly established—it may come from dopamine that circulates in the bloodstream and derives from the sympathetic nervous system, or it may be synthesized locally by other types of pancreatic cells.|$|E
5|$|Though fibrofolliculomas {{are unique}} to Birt–Hogg–Dubé, they may present with an {{ambiguous}} appearance and must be confirmed histologically. Other diseases can mimic the dermatologic manifestations of BHD, including tuberous sclerosis complex, Cowden syndrome, familial trichoepitheliomas, and multiple <b>endocrine</b> neoplasia type 1. Tuberous sclerosis must be distinguished because both disorders can present with angiofibromas on the face, though they are more common in tuberous sclerosis.|$|E
5|$|Traditional {{classification}} of endometrial carcinomas is based either on clinical and <b>endocrine</b> features (Type I and Type II), or histopathological characteristics (endometroid, serous, and clear-cell). Some tumours {{are difficult to}} classify and have features overlapping more than one category. High grade endometroid tumours in particular tend to have both type I and type II features.|$|E
5|$|A natural bobtail can {{be found}} in some members of the breed, which is not a {{mutation}} of the T-box gene, and so is allowed under conformation show rules. Health-related research on the breed has been limited, with no major studies conducted in Britain. However, it has been included in studies outside the UK, including by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) in the United States. The King Charles Spaniel has a number of eye and respiratory system disorders common to brachycephalic dogs, and <b>endocrine</b> and metabolic diseases common to small breeds, as well as specific breed-associated health conditions. The average lifespan is 10 to 12 years, and the breed should be able to reproduce naturally.|$|E
5|$|Contaminants {{that are}} {{discharged}} into {{the marine environment}} accumulate in the bodies of marine mammals when they are stored unintentionally in their blubber along with energy. Contaminants that {{are found in the}} tissues of marine mammals include heavy metals, such as mercury and lead, but also organochlorides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. For example, these can cause disruptive effects on <b>endocrine</b> systems; impair the reproductive system, and lower the immune system of individuals, leading to a higher number of deaths. Other pollutants such as oil, plastic debris and sewage threaten the livelihood of marine mammals.|$|E
5|$|In the tropics, many {{amphibians}} breed continuously or at {{any time}} of year. In temperate regions, breeding is mostly seasonal, usually in the spring, and is triggered by increasing day length, rising temperatures or rainfall. Experiments have shown the importance of temperature, but the trigger event, especially in arid regions, is often a storm. In anurans, males usually arrive at the breeding sites before females and the vocal chorus they produce may stimulate ovulation in females and the <b>endocrine</b> activity of males that are not yet reproductively active.|$|E
5|$|Increased dietary {{selenium}} {{reduces the}} effects of mercury toxicity, although it is effective only at low to modest doses of mercury. Evidence suggests that the molecular mechanisms of mercury toxicity includes the irreversible inhibition of selenoenzymes that are required to prevent and reverse oxidative damage in brain and <b>endocrine</b> tissues. An antioxidant, selenoneine, which is derived from selenium and {{has been found to}} be present in the blood of bluefin tuna, is the subject of scientific research regarding its possible roles in inflammatory and chronic diseases, methylmercury detoxification, and oxidative damages.|$|E
5|$|Phenolics, {{sometimes}} called phenols, consist of an aromatic 6-carbon ring bonded to a hydroxy group. Some phenols have antiseptic properties, while others disrupt <b>endocrine</b> activity. Phenolics range from simple tannins {{to the more}} complex flavonoids that give plants much of their red, blue, yellow, and white pigments. Complex phenolics called polyphenols are capable of producing {{many different types of}} effects on humans, including antioxidant properties. Some examples of phenolics used for defense in plants are: lignin, silymarin and cannabinoids. Condensed tannins, polymers composed of 2 to 50 (or more) flavonoid molecules, inhibit herbivore digestion by binding to consumed plant proteins and making them more difficult for animals to digest, and by interfering with protein absorption and digestive enzymes.|$|E
5|$|The cytosol is {{a complex}} mixture of {{substances}} dissolved in water. Although water forms {{the large majority of}} the cytosol, its structure and properties within cells is not well understood. The concentrations of ions such as sodium and potassium are different in the cytosol than in the extracellular fluid; these differences in ion levels are important in processes such as osmoregulation, cell signaling, and the generation of action potentials in excitable cells such as <b>endocrine,</b> nerve and muscle cells. The cytosol also contains large amounts of macromolecules, which can alter how molecules behave, through macromolecular crowding.|$|E
5|$|The thyroid gland, {{or simply}} the thyroid, is an <b>endocrine</b> gland in the neck, {{consisting}} of two lobes connected by an isthmus. It is found {{at the front of}} the neck, below the Adam's apple. The thyroid gland secretes thyroid hormones, which primarily influence the metabolic rate and protein synthesis. The hormones also have many other effects including those on development. The thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) are created from iodine and tyrosine. The thyroid also produces the hormone calcitonin, which plays a role in calcium homeostasis.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{evidence}} that gender differences in attachment patterns of adaptive significance begin to emerge in middle childhood. Insecure attachment and early psychosocial stress indicate the presence of environmental risk (for example poverty, mental illness, instability, minority status, violence). Environmental risk can cause insecure attachment, while also favouring the development of strategies for earlier reproduction. Different reproductive strategies have different adaptive values for males and females: Insecure males tend to adopt avoidant strategies, whereas insecure females tend to adopt anxious/ambivalent strategies, unless they are in a very high risk environment. Adrenarche is proposed as the <b>endocrine</b> mechanism underlying the reorganization of insecure attachment in middle childhood.|$|E
25|$|<b>Endocrine</b> signals target distant cells. <b>Endocrine</b> cells produce {{hormones that}} {{travel through the}} blood to reach {{all parts of the}} body.|$|E
25|$|The kidney {{participates in}} whole-body homeostasis, {{regulating}} acid-base balance, electrolyte concentrations, extracellular fluid volume, and blood pressure. The kidney accomplishes these homeostatic functions both independently and {{in concert with}} other organs, particularly those of the <b>endocrine</b> system. Various <b>endocrine</b> hormones coordinate these <b>endocrine</b> functions; these include renin, angiotensin II, aldosterone, antidiuretic hormone, and atrial natriuretic peptide, among others.|$|E
25|$|During development, {{definitive}} endoderm and ectoderm differentiates {{into several}} gastrointestinal epithelial lineages, including <b>endocrine</b> cells. Many {{studies have indicated}} that Notch signaling has a major role in <b>endocrine</b> development.|$|E
25|$|<b>Endocrine</b> disrupting {{chemicals}} {{can interfere}} with the <b>endocrine</b> system {{in a number of}} ways including hormone synthesis, storage/release, transport and clearance, receptor recognition and binding, and postreceptor activation.|$|E
25|$|It happens rarely, {{but it is}} {{possible}} for a pancreatitis attack to activate the <b>endocrine</b> portion of the organ back into being capable of producing insulin once again in dogs. It {{is possible}} for acute pancreatitis to cause a temporary, or transient diabetes, most likely due to damage to the <b>endocrine</b> portion's beta cells. Insulin resistance that can follow a pancreatitis attack may last for some time thereafter. Pancreatitis can damage the <b>endocrine</b> pancreas {{to the point where the}} diabetes is permanent.|$|E
25|$|<b>Endocrine</b> {{insufficiency}} of {{the pancreas}} occurs with JBS, {{though it is}} sometimes less common and less pronounced than the more prominent effects on exocrine function. The islets of Langerhans are ducts in the pancreas where <b>endocrine</b> activity such as the release of hormones glucagon, somatostatin and insulin takes place. Pancreatic <b>endocrine</b> insufficiency in JBS {{can be associated with}} either a buildup of connective tissue in the islet regions, congenital replacement of the islets with fatty tissue, or improper nerve signalling to the islets. <b>Endocrine</b> dysfunction of the pancreas often results in diabetes mellitus. Both insulin resistance and diabetes have been observed with JBS, and it is suggested that diabetes should be considered as a complication of JBS and its course.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Endocrine</b> Society {{does not}} {{recommend}} <b>endocrine</b> treatment of prepubertal children because clinical experience suggests that GID can be reliably assessed {{only after the}} first signs of puberty. It recommends treating transsexual adolescents by suppressing puberty with puberty blockers until age 16 years old, after which cross-sex hormones may be given.|$|E
