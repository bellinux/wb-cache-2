5000|$|The {{optic axis}} {{figure of a}} biaxial mineral is more complex. One or two curved isogyres (sometimes called [...] "brushes") will be visible, one of which will have its point of maximum {{curvature}} perfectly centred. (The figure shows an example with a single <b>isogyre</b> visible.) If two isogyres are visible, they will be positioned back-to-back. Rotating the stage will cause the isogyres to move and change shape strikingly - moving from a position where the isogyres curve smoothly and are widely separated at their closest point, then gradually becoming more tightly curved/squarer at their midpoints as they approach each other (a second <b>isogyre</b> appearing {{from out of the}} field of view if it was absent before), then merging to form a maltese cross pattern very much like that of a uniaxial mineral. Continuing to rotate the stage will cause the isogyres to separate again - but into the opposite quadrants to where they were previously - then meet again, then separate again into their original quadrants, and so on. The isogyres will touch each other four times in one 360 degree revolution, with each time corresponding to one of the extinction positions seen in normal cross polarised light.|$|E

The curved shape of the <b>isogyre</b> is characteristic of biaxial minerals - though the degree of curvature will change as the microscope stage is rotated, and at some orientations the pattern will resemble the [...] "maltese cross" [...] pattern of a uniaxial mineral. The left hand image illustrates the figure alone; the grey patch at the centre indicates the low first order (grey) birefringence colours seen here (the order of the colours seen would in reality increase away from the center, but these colours are not shown). The two right hand figures show {{the effect of adding}} a sensitive tint plate to the setup, replacing the grey at the centre with second order blue and first yellow birefringence colours. The polarity of the yellow and blue reveals whether the mineral being viewed is optically [...] "biaxial positive" [...] (top) or [...] "biaxial negative" [...] (bottom), which can be a key property in identifying the mineral (or investigating its composition).|$|E
5000|$|The maximum {{separation}} between <b>isogyres</b> {{occurs when the}} slide is rotated exactly 45 degrees {{from one of the}} orientations where the <b>isogyres</b> come together. The point where the <b>isogyres</b> is most tightly curved represents the position of each of the two optic axes present for a biaxial mineral, and thus the maximum {{separation between}} the two curves is diagnostic of the angle between the two optic axes for the mineral. This angle is called the optic angle and often notated as [...] "2V". In some cases, knowing the optic angle can be a useful diagnostic tool to discriminate between two minerals which otherwise look very similar. In other cases, 2V varies with chemical composition in a known way for a given mineral, and its measured value can be used to estimate ratios between elements in the crystal structure - for example, Fe/Mg in olivines. However, in these cases it becomes important to also be sure of the optic sign of the mineral (essentially, this tells you how the optic angle is orientated with respect to the whole optical indicatrix describing the refractive indices of the mineral in 3D). The optic sign and optic angle can be determined together by combining interference pattern microscopy with use of a sensitive tint plate.|$|R
5000|$|On {{either side}} of the [...] "saddle" [...] formed by the <b>isogyres,</b> {{birefringent}} rings of colour run concentrically around two eye like shapes called melanotopes. The closest bands are circles, but further out they become pear shaped with the narrow part pointing to the saddle. The larger bands surrounding the saddle and both melanotopes are figure 8 shaped.|$|R
40|$|The {{cross pattern}} (<b>isogyres)</b> formed by certain {{crystals}} when ihey are placed between crossed polarizers and illuminated with convergent light results from birefringent properties ofthe medium. A similar image {{is seen in}} refracting structures which exhibit little or no birefringence, such as the eye lens. This paper provides a mathematical explanation {{of the formation of}} <b>isogyres</b> by refraction. Illumination by polarized light is very useful for eliciting information about the internal organization of a solid and is often used to determine the structural properties of crystals. Many crystals exhibit the property of bire-fringence, the extent and type of which depends on their internal structure. For crystals in which the lattice has cubic symmetry, the refractive index is isotropic and such crystals do not exhibit birefringence. In biaxial crystals., the indices are different in three orthogonal planes. In between these extremes are the uniaxia! crys-tals in which two of the three directional indices ar...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{new method}} of {{measuring}} the Faraday rotation angle directly in optical current transducer (OCT) is proposed based on conoscopic interference pattern. The concept of conoscopic interference and isogyres is illustrated. The {{relationship between the}} isogyres angle Φ and the polarized plane rotation angle θcaused by the polarizer rotation is deduced to 2 θ= Φ. This rule {{can be used to}} measure the Faraday rotation angle in OCT according to the Faraday magneto-optic effect when a linear polarized light beam passing through a crystal and current magnetic field acting on it at the same time, the polarized plane will be rotated and the angle of <b>isogyre</b> will be changed. An experiment is designed to demonstrate the relationship between the coil current and the <b>isogyre</b> angle. CCD camera are used to capture the conoscopic interference pattern to measure the current of coils, the angle of <b>isogyre</b> is calculated by image processing technology. The measuring range is 18 times of traditional OCT. This experiment proves the relationship between the isogyres angle Φ and the polarized plane rotation angle θ, and the linear relationship between the current and the <b>isogyre</b> angle is realized...|$|E
40|$|A {{rotating}} polarimetric 90 °-cross linear-filter interferometry {{system was}} used to detect the morphological characteristics and features of interference patterns produced in in-vivo corneal stroma in healthy human corneas of 23 subjects. The characteristic corneal isogyres presenting with an evident cross-shaped pattern, grossly aligned with the fixation axis, were observed in all patients with centers within the pupillary dark area, impeding the exact determination of the center point. During the rotational scan in 78. 3 % of the eyes the cross-shaped pattern of the <b>isogyre</b> gradually separated to form two distinct hyperbolic arcs in opposite quadrants, reaching their maximal separation at 45 degrees with respect to angle of cross-shaped pattern formation. The corneal cross and hyperbolic-pattern repeated every 90 ° throughout the 360 ° rotational scan. While {{the interpretation of the}} isogyres presents particular difficulties, two summary parameters can be extracted for each cornea: the presence/orientation of a single or two dark areas in post-processed images and isochromes. However, the development of dedicated software for semi-quantitative analysis of these parameters and enantiomorphism may become available in the near future. The possible application of polarimetric interferometry in the field of both corneal pathologies and corneal surgery may be of great interest for clinical purposes...|$|E
5000|$|An {{interference}} figure produced looking straight down {{or close to}} the optic axis of a uniaxial mineral will show a characteristic [...] "Maltese" [...] cross shape to its <b>isogyres.</b> If you are looking perfectly down the optic axis, the pattern will remain completely unchanging as the stage is rotated. However, if the viewing angle is slightly away from the optic axis, {{the centre of the}} cross will revolve/orbit around the central point as the stage is rotated. The form of the cross will stay constant as it moves.|$|R
40|$|Restricted Access. The {{results of}} a recent {{investigation}} of the nematic biaxiality in a bent-core mesogen (A 131) are in apparent disagreement with earlier claims. Samples of mesogen A 131 used in the two studies were investigated with polarized optical microscopy, conoscopy, carbon- 13 NMR, and crossover frequency measurements. The results demonstrate that textural changes associated {{with the growth of}} biaxial nematic order appear at ∼ 149 [*]°C. The Maltese cross observed in the conoscopic figure gradually splits into two <b>isogyres</b> at lower temperatures indicating phase biaxiality. Presence of the uniaxial to biaxial nematic phase transition is further confirmed by temperature trends of local order parameters based on 13 C chemical shifts in NMR experiments. Frequency switching measurements also clearly reveal a transition at 149 [*]°C. Differences between the two reports appear {{to be related to the}} presence of solvent, impurities, and/or adsorbed gases in samples of A 131 used in the study of Van Le et al. [Phys. Rev. E 79 030701 (2009) ]...|$|R
5000|$|A conoscopic {{interference}} pattern or interference figure {{is a pattern}} of birefringent colours crossed by dark bands (or <b>isogyres),</b> which can be produced using a geological petrographic microscope {{for the purposes of}} mineral identification and investigation of mineral optical and chemical properties. The figures are produced by optical interference when diverging light rays travel through an optically non-isotropic substance - that is, one in which the substance's refractive index varies in different directions within it. The figure {{can be thought of as}} a [...] "map" [...] of how the birefringence of a mineral would vary with viewing angle away from perpendicular to the slide, where the central colour is the birefringence seen looking straight down, and the colours further from the centre equivalent to viewing the mineral at ever increasing angles from perpendicular. The dark bands correspond to positions where optical extinction (apparent isotropy) would be seen. In other words, the interference figure presents all possible birefringence colours for the mineral at once.|$|R
