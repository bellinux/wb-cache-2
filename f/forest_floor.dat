5|$|The lowest {{elevations}} of Pinkham Notch are {{occupied by}} a northern hardwood forest. This forest type is primarily deciduous and consists mostly of sugar maple, American beech, and yellow birch. There is also a proliferation of understory and <b>forest</b> <b>floor</b> plants; common examples include wild sarsaparilla, painted trillium, hobblebush, and Indian cucumber-root.|$|E
5|$|Between touring with Magnapop, bassist Scott Rowe also {{performed}} in Luigi from 2003 through 2008 with former Magnapop drummer Brian Fletcher {{as well as}} Bad Magic Number with current drummer Williams. The former has released two albums—2003's Vamonos and Found on the <b>Forest</b> <b>Floor</b> in 2005. Williams began drumming for Dead Register in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Like other bleeding-hearts, the Sulu bleeding-heart is {{primarily}} a sedentary bird, feeding on the <b>forest</b> <b>floor</b> and flying only for short distances. It only perches in trees in order to roost or mate. When alarmed, bleeding-hearts run quickly into nearby undergrowth. It is very elusive in its forested habitat, and nothing else is known about its behavior.|$|E
50|$|The diet of the Cordillera ground warbler is {{primarily}} invertebrates, {{it has been}} sighted scouring <b>forest</b> <b>floors</b> for prey hidden under leaves.|$|R
50|$|Ariolimax columbianus is {{native to}} the <b>forest</b> <b>floors</b> along North America's Pacific coastal {{coniferous}} rainforest belt (including redwood forests) which stretches from Southeastern Alaska to Santa Cruz, California.|$|R
50|$|There is a well-preserved 320 m wide crater at the volcano's summit. The crater is {{breached}} {{by three}} gorges {{and has a}} 120 m deep, densely <b>forested</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{animals that}} eat the figs {{disperse}} the seeds, which then germinate and grow on other plants (epiphytes) or on rocks (lithophytes). As the new plants develop, they send roots to the <b>forest</b> <b>floor.</b> Figs growing on other plants grow {{larger and larger}} until they strangle their hosts. Ficus obliqua is long-lived, and trees are thought to live in excess of 500 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{avifauna}} {{consists of}} various types of laughing thrushes, which live in shrubs and on the <b>forest</b> <b>floor.</b> The blue whistling-thrush, redstarts, and forktails are found near waterfalls and hill-streams. The mixed hunting species present in the region include warblers, tit-babblers, treecreepers, white-eyes, wrens, and rose finches. Raptors such as black eagle, black-winged kite and kestrels; and pheasants such as monals and blood pheasant are also found.|$|E
5|$|At Paramount, {{the crew}} filmed all the scenes {{that would take}} place on soundstages, {{including}} the Enterprise and Bird-of-Prey sets, the Paradise City interiors, and the campfire location. Production was smoother on set, and the crew shot scenes ahead of schedule. The crew fabricated a stand-in set for the God planet location, where additional scenes were filmed to combine with the location footage. Spock's catching of Kirk as the captain falls off El Capitan was filmed against a set that replicated the <b>forest</b> <b>floor</b> and was rotated ninety degrees.|$|E
5000|$|Hepatica nobilis, {{a synonym}} for Anemone hepatica, the kidneywort, liverwort, pennywort or common hepatica, an {{herbaceous}} plant species native to the <b>forest</b> <b>floors</b> of temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere ...|$|R
50|$|Described as semi-arboreal, {{they are}} largely nocturnal, {{climbing}} {{trees and shrubs}} as well as crossing open areas such as rock faces, <b>forest</b> <b>floors</b> and even roads. However, basking behaviour is commonly observed.|$|R
50|$|His {{still lifes}} include outdoor {{settings}} with dead game and <b>forest</b> <b>floors</b> and indoor compositions with {{a profusion of}} small objects, fruits, single blossoms, nuts and other objects scattered across a surface.|$|R
5|$|The {{seeds of}} conifers, {{the largest group}} of gymnosperms, are {{enclosed}} in a cone and most species have seeds that are light and papery that can be blown considerable distances once free from the cone. Sometimes the seed remains in the cone for years waiting for a trigger event to liberate it. Fire stimulates release and germination of seeds of the jack pine, and also enriches the <b>forest</b> <b>floor</b> with wood ash and removes competing vegetation. Similarly, a number of angiosperms including Acacia cyclops and Acacia mangium have seeds that germinate better after exposure to high temperatures.|$|E
5|$|The {{silver birch}} has an open canopy which allows plenty {{of light to}} reach the ground. This allows a variety of mosses, grasses and {{flowering}} plants to grow beneath which in turn attract insects. Flowering plants often found in birch woods include primrose (Primula vulgaris), violet (Viola riviniana), bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa) and wood sorrel (Oxalis acetosella). Small shrubs that grow on the <b>forest</b> <b>floor</b> include blaeberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and cowberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea).|$|E
5|$|Xeromphalina setulipes is {{only known}} from the type {{locality}} {{in the province of}} Ciudad Real, Spain. Members of the Mycenaceae are saprotrophic, and X.setulipes was found in woodland made up of cork oak (Quercus suber) and Portuguese oak (Quercus faginea), with undergrowth consisting of gum rockrose (Cistus ladanifer), prickly juniper (Juniperus oxycedrus), and various heathers (Erica species). The mushrooms were growing in clusters on the <b>forest</b> <b>floor</b> from acid soil, surrounded by dead plant matter. The species's ecological patterns may be useful identifying characteristics, distinct from other, similar species. The mushrooms were found in autumn, and collected in November.|$|E
5|$|Pittas are {{medium-sized}} stocky passerines with fairly long, strong legs, short {{tails and}} stout bills. Many are brightly coloured. They spend {{the majority of}} their time on wet <b>forest</b> <b>floors,</b> eating snails, insects and similar invertebrate prey.|$|R
50|$|Xeromphalina cirris is {{a species}} of agaric fungus in the family Mycenaceae. Described as new to science in 1988, it is known from montane or boreal {{coniferous}} <b>forests</b> <b>floors</b> in British Columbia, Ontario, Colorado, Idaho, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.|$|R
25|$|There are {{numerous}} forests in New South Wales, with such tree species as Red Gum Eucalyptus and Crow Ash (Flindersia australis), being represented. <b>Forest</b> <b>floors</b> have a diverse set of understory shrubs and fungi. One of the widespread fungi is Witch's Butter (Tremella mesenterica).|$|R
5|$|Although fishers are {{competent}} tree climbers, {{they spend}} most of their time on the <b>forest</b> <b>floor</b> and prefer continuous forest to other habitats. Fishers have been found in extensive conifer forests typical of the boreal forest but are also common in mixed hardwood and conifer forests. Fishers prefer areas with continuous overhead cover with greater than 80% coverage and will avoid areas with less than 50% coverage. Fishers are more likely to be found in old-growth forests. Since female fishers require moderately large trees for denning, forests that have been heavily logged and have extensive second growth appears to be unsuitable for their needs.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{occupy a}} wide range of {{ecological}} positions. While some birds are generalists, others are highly specialised in their habitat or food requirements. Even within a single habitat, such as a forest, the niches occupied by different species of birds vary, with some species feeding in the forest canopy, others beneath the canopy, and still others on the <b>forest</b> <b>floor.</b> Forest birds may be insectivores, frugivores, and nectarivores. Aquatic birds generally feed by fishing, plant eating, and piracy or kleptoparasitism. Birds of prey specialise in hunting mammals or other birds, while vultures are specialised scavengers. Avivores are animals that are specialised at preying on birds.|$|E
5|$|Birds roam {{from the}} <b>forest</b> <b>floor</b> to the canopy, but {{particularly}} favour the middle story. They mostly operate alone, in pairs {{or groups of}} three, and {{can also be found}} mixing with long-billed bernierias. Larger flocks do not occur. The nelicourvi weaver is an agile, active species that generally makes a lot of noise. It searches for insects on leaves, and branches, while hanging from vines and twigs. It looks for animals in rolled leaves such as wild ginger Aframomum and along leaf litter, probing crevices, and opening dead stems. It also dismembers flowers to reach the nectar. Mostly, arthropods (beetles, bugs, butterflies, caterpillars, dragonflies, flies, grasshoppers, leafhoppers, stick insects, millipedes and spiders) are consumed, sometimes small vertebrates (lizards and chameleons), next to some nectar, fruit and probably seeds.|$|E
30|$|Distribution and Habitat. Currently 61 species, two varieties, and one {{natural hybrid}} {{distributed}} in the caves, fissures and <b>forest</b> <b>floors</b> of limestone karsts in southern China (Guangxi, southern Guizhou, and southeastern Yunnan provinces) and northern Vietnam, at elevations between ca. 100 and 1, 300  m.|$|R
50|$|Dicranoloma is a genus of mosses in {{the family}} Dicranaceae. Species within this genus are dioicous. Another genus in this family is Campylopus. Example occurrences of the genus Dicranoloma {{is in the form}} of mats on beech/podocarp <b>forest</b> <b>floors</b> of New Zealand's {{northern}} South Island.|$|R
50|$|The twist-necked turtle inhabits a {{large area}} {{throughout}} northern and central South America, from the southern Orinoco drainage in Venezuela to the Amazon basin in Brazil. However, P. platycephala does not inhabit large rivers, but instead is found in shallow creeks and on <b>forest</b> <b>floors.</b>|$|R
5|$|In cool {{temperate}} regions, conifers often predominate; {{a widely}} distributed climax {{community in the}} far north of the northern hemisphere is moist taiga or northern coniferous forest (also called boreal forest). Taiga is the world's largest land biome, forming 29% of the world's forest cover. The long cold winter of the far north is unsuitable for plant growth and trees must grow rapidly in the short summer season when the temperature rises and the days are long. Light is very limited under their dense cover {{and there may be}} little plant life on the <b>forest</b> <b>floor,</b> although fungi may abound. Similar woodland is found on mountains where the altitude causes the average temperature to be lower thus reducing the length of the growing season.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius vietus (commonly {{known as}} the grey milkcap) is a species of fungus in the family Russulaceae, first {{described}} by Elias Magnus Fries. It produces moderately sized and brittle mushrooms, which grow on the <b>forest</b> <b>floor</b> or on rotting wood. The flattened-convex cap can vary in shape, sometimes forming {{the shape of a}} wide funnel. It is typically grey, but the colour varies. The species has crowded, light-coloured gills, which produce white milk. The spore print is typically whitish, but also varies considerably. The mushrooms typically have a strong, acrid taste and have been described as inedible, but other authors have described them as consumable after boiling. L.vietus feeds by forming an ectomycorrhizal relationship with surrounding trees, and it favours birch. It grows in autumn months and is fairly common in Europe, North America and eastern Asia.|$|E
5|$|Lactifluus piperatus (synonym Lactarius piperatus), {{commonly}} known as the peppery milk-cap, is a semi-edible basidiomycete fungus of the genus Lactifluus. Despite being edible, it is not recommended by some because of its poor taste, though can be used as seasoning when dried. The fruiting body is a creamy-white mushroom which is funnel-shaped when mature, with exceptionally crowded gills. It bleeds a whitish peppery-tasting milk when cut. Widely distributed across Europe and eastern North America, Lactifluus piperatus has been accidentally introduced to Australia. Mycorrhizal, it forms a symbiotic relationship with various species of deciduous tree, including beech, and hazel, and fruiting bodies are found on the <b>forest</b> <b>floor</b> in deciduous woodland.|$|E
50|$|The link rat is nocturnal and crepuscular. It prefers {{seasonally}} flooded <b>forest</b> <b>floors</b> between Cameroon and the Victoria Nile. It has {{a widespread}} but scattered distribution and is seldom common. It feeds mainly on insects, crustaceans, slugs and some fallen fruits, notably palm-nut husks.|$|R
50|$|There are {{numerous}} forests in New South Wales, with such tree species as Red Gum Eucalyptus and Crow Ash (Flindersia australis), being represented. <b>Forest</b> <b>floors</b> have a diverse set of understory shrubs and fungi. One of the widespread fungi is Witch's Butter (Tremella mesenterica).|$|R
25|$|The {{vegetation}} is heterogeneous and storeyed due to {{the prevalence}} of hilly and mountainous relief. In Cluj County can be met {{a wide range of}} plant formations. Sub-alpine floor, present in Vlădeasa Massif and Muntele Mare, is characterized by lawns with midget grasses and juniper bushes. The spruce <b>forests</b> <b>floor,</b> expanded on mountain slopes between 1,000–1,600 m, consists predominantly of spruce mixed with fir, and the deciduous <b>forests</b> <b>floor</b> develops on all forms of relief, ranging from 400–1,000 m, and consists of sessile forests mixed with beech, hornbeam or elm. On slopes with northern exposure of Luna and Lujerdiu valleys develop compact clusters of sessile, hornbeam, ash and elm forests. In the Hilly Plain of Transylvania appear islands of steppe, alternating with patches of forests.|$|R
5|$|Like other bleeding-hearts, the Sulu bleeding-heart is {{primarily}} a sedentary bird, feeding on the <b>forest</b> <b>floor</b> and flying only for short distances. Little is known about its behavior due to the paucity of sightings. Searches of Tawi-Tawi in 1971 and 1991 did not discover any evidence of the species' continued existence. Most of the bird's habitat was logged on Tawi-Tawi by 1994. However, an ethnobiological survey in 1995 revealed that the bleeding-heart was common until the 1970s and still survives on small islets near Tawi-Tawi. While another survey in 2009 failed to find the species, there is some hope that it may still persist. For this reason, it is currently listed as critically endangered by the IUCN. Any surviving population would be very small, likely numbering fewer than 50 individuals, and would be threatened by habitat destruction and uncontrolled hunting.|$|E
5|$|Millipedes {{occur on}} all continents except Antarctica, and occupy almost all {{terrestrial}} habitats, ranging {{as far north}} as the Arctic Circle in Iceland, Norway, and Central Russia, and as far south as Santa Cruz Province, Argentina. Typically <b>forest</b> <b>floor</b> dwellers, they live in leaf litter, dead wood, or soil, with a preference for humid conditions. In temperate zones, millipedes are most abundant in moist deciduous forests, and may reach densities of over 1,000 individuals per square metre. Other habitats include coniferous forests, deserts, caves, and alpine ecosystems. Some species can survive freshwater floods and live submerged underwater for up to 11 months. A few species occur near the seashore and can survive in somewhat salty conditions.|$|E
5|$|Over 40 {{species of}} mammals have been documented, {{including}} the black bear, coyote, cougar, bobcat, beaver, river otter, black-tailed deer, and elk. Along the coastline, California sea lions, Steller sea lions and harbor seals {{live near the}} shore and on seastacks, rocky outcroppings forming small islands just off the coast. Dolphins and Pacific gray whales are occasionally seen offshore. Roosevelt elk are the most readily observed of the large mammals in the park. Successful herds, brought back from the verge of extinction in the region, are now a common site in park areas south of the Klamath River. Many smaller mammals live in the high forest canopy. Different species of bats, such as the big brown bat, and other smaller mammals including the red squirrel and northern flying squirrel {{spend most of their}} lives well above the <b>forest</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
50|$|Salamanders mostly feed {{on small}} {{invertebrates}} found on <b>forest</b> <b>floors.</b> Diet {{is influenced by}} size and micro-habitat of the salamander. Bolitoglossa rufescens are small and strictly arboreal, research shows that their diet is comprised significantly of ants followed by beetles and weevils (Coleoptera), collembolans, and arachnids.|$|R
50|$|Warming {{spring and}} summer {{temperatures}} increase flammability of materials {{that make up the}} <b>forest</b> <b>floors.</b> Warmer temperatures cause dehydration of these materials, which prevents rain from soaking up and dampening fires. Furthermore, pollution from wildfires can exacerbate climate change by releasing atmospheric aerosols, which modify cloud and precipitation patterns.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} found on coastal prairie, grasslands and some open <b>forest</b> <b>floors.</b> Its range is along the coastal ranges from region to the {{northern}} Santa Barbara County Channel Islands and mainland, Northwestern California, the Sacramento Valley, and the Sierra Nevada foothills {{from there to the}} Tehachapi Mountains.|$|R
