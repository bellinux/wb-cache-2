5|$|In 2007, Airbus {{introduced}} a new enhanced comfort cabin for the A320. Airbus says it offers better luggage storage and a quieter cabin, packaged with a more modern look and feel. Additionally, improved cabin efficiency from a new galley concept, reduced weight, improved <b>ergonomics</b> and food hygiene, and recycling requirements. LED ambiance lighting is optionally available. Anytime LEDs are used for the Passenger Service Unit (PSU) and passengers can get information with touchscreen displays. Older A320 series aircraft can be updated.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} Merchant Navy class, {{electric}} lighting was provided on both locomotive and footplate, {{powered by a}} steam-powered generator below the footplate. The gauges were lit by ultra-violet light. This enabled clearer night-time vision of the boiler steam pressure gauge and the brake pipe vacuum pressure gauge whilst eliminating dazzle, {{making it easier for}} the crew to see signals along the track. Close attention was paid to the <b>ergonomics</b> of the cab, which was designed with the controls required for operation grouped according to the needs of both driver and fireman, thus promoting safe operation. As an aid to the fireman, a treadle used steam pressure to open the firehole doors, where the coal is shovelled into the firebox. The footplate was entirely enclosed, improving crew working conditions in winter. Other refinements and innovations used on the Merchant Navy class included steam-powered clasp brakes and the unusual 6ft 2 in (1.88 m) Bulleid Firth Brown (BFB) wheels.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} years, companies applied {{the principles of}} corporate identity and corporate design to increase awareness and recognition by consumers and differentiation from competitors. Olivetti became famous for its attention to design through their corporate design activities. In 1936 Olivetti hired Giovanni Pintori in their publicity department and promoted Marcello Nizzoli from the product design department to develop design in a comprehensive corporate philosophy. In 1956, inspired by the compelling brand character of Olivetti, Thomas Watson, Jr., CEO of IBM, retained American architect and industrial designer Eliot Noyes to develop a corporate-wide IBM Design Program consisting of coherent brand-design strategy together with a design management system to guide and oversee the comprehensive brand identity elements of: products, graphics, exhibits, architecture, interiors and fine art. This seminal effort by Noyes, with his inclusion of Paul Rand and Charles Eames as consultants, {{is considered to be}} the first comprehensive corporate design program in America. Up to and during the 1960s, debates in the design community were focused on <b>ergonomics,</b> functionalism, and corporate design, while debates in management addressed Just in time, Total quality management, and product specification. The main proponents of design management at that time were AEG, Bauhaus, HfG Ulm, the British Design Council, Deutscher Werkbund, Olivetti, IBM, Peter Behrens, and Walter Paepcke.|$|E
25|$|Some {{applications}} of ergonomic simulation in include analysis {{of solid waste}} collection, disaster management tasks, interactive gaming, automotive assembly line, virtual prototyping of rehabilitation aids, and aerospace product design. Ford engineers use <b>ergonomics</b> simulation software to perform virtual product design reviews. Using engineering data, the simulations assist evaluation of assembly <b>ergonomics.</b> The company uses Siemen's Jack and Jill <b>ergonomics</b> simulation software in improving worker safety and efficiency, without the need to build expensive prototypes.|$|E

25|$|Modeling and {{simulation}} of a task {{can be performed}} by manually manipulating the virtual human in the simulated environment. Some <b>ergonomics</b> simulation software permits interactive, real-time simulation and evaluation through actual human input via motion capture technologies. However, motion capture for <b>ergonomics</b> requires expensive equipment {{and the creation of}} props to represent the environment or product.|$|E
25|$|Ergonomic {{simulation}} {{involves the}} analysis of virtual products or manual tasks within a virtual environment. In the engineering process, the aim of <b>ergonomics</b> is to develop and to improve the design of products and work environments. Ergonomic simulation utilizes an anthropometric virtual representation of the human, commonly referenced as a mannequin or Digital Human Models (DHMs), to mimic the postures, mechanical loads, and performance of a human operator in a simulated environment such as an airplane, automobile, or manufacturing facility. DHMs are recognized as evolving and valuable tool for performing proactive <b>ergonomics</b> analysis and design. The simulations employ 3D-graphics and physics-based models to animate the virtual humans. <b>Ergonomics</b> software uses inverse kinematics (IK) capability for posing the DHMs. Several ergonomic simulation tools have been developed including Jack, SAFEWORK, RAMSIS, and SAMMIE.|$|E
25|$|In 1979 Professor Bob Audley became Head of Department. His {{interests}} lay {{in human}} experimental psychology, both in basic {{processes such as}} decision making, and in applications like medical diagnosis. In the same year the <b>Ergonomics</b> Unit, responsible for the organisation of the University Intercollegiate MSc in <b>Ergonomics,</b> became associated with the Department {{under the direction of}} Professor John Long. The <b>Ergonomics</b> Unit closed in 2001 on Professor Long’s retirement and was replaced by the UCL Interaction Centre (UCLIC), a joint venture with Computer Science, under the direction of Professor Harold Thimbleby. In October 1982 a new Medical Research Council Cognitive Development Unit, under the direction of Professor John Morton, was set up to strengthen existing work in the Department and provide new teaching and research opportunities for both undergraduate and post graduate students. The CDU closed in October 1998 on Professor Morton’s retirement.|$|E

25|$|Those in {{the field}} of {{occupational}} health come {{from a wide range of}} disciplines and professions including medicine, psychology, epidemiology, physiotherapy and rehabilitation, occupational therapy, occupational medicine, human factors and <b>ergonomics,</b> and many others. Professionals advise on a broad range of occupational health matters. These include how to avoid particular pre-existing conditions causing a problem in the occupation, correct posture for the work, frequency of rest breaks, preventative action that can be undertaken, and so forth.|$|E
25|$|Occupational {{therapists}} {{work with}} clients {{who have had}} an injury and are returning to work. OTs perform assessments to simulate work tasks {{in order to determine}} best matches for work, accommodations needed at work, or the level of disability. Work conditioning and work hardening are interventions used to restore job skills that may have changed due to an illness or injury. Occupational therapists can also prevent work related injuries through <b>ergonomics</b> and on site work evaluations.|$|E
25|$|Biosafety {{cabinets}} {{are used}} {{on a daily basis}} for hours. Besides protection of user and sample material, the human design factors (<b>ergonomics)</b> of the work become more and more important. This includes reduction of the noise level (for a more convenient working atmosphere), a height adjustable stand or stool (for optimized sitting position), panorama side windows (more light within cabinet), 10°angled front sash (enables better sitting position) as well as strong light sources (better view within cabinet) to improve the working conditions.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency {{launched}} Energy Star, {{a voluntary}} labeling {{program that is}} designed to promote and recognize energy efficiency in monitors, climate control equipment, and other technologies. This resulted in the widespread adoption of sleep mode among consumer electronics. Concurrently, the Swedish organization TCO Development launched the TCO Certification program to promote low magnetic and electrical emissions from CRT-based computer displays; this program was later expanded to include criteria on energy consumption, <b>ergonomics,</b> and the use of hazardous materials in construction.|$|E
25|$|Since GNOME 2, {{productivity}} {{has been}} a key focus for GNOME. To this end, the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) were created. All GNOME programs share a coherent style of graphical user interface (GUI) {{but are not limited}} to the employment of the same GUI widgets. Rather, the design of the GNOME GUI is guided by concepts described in the GNOME HIG, itself relying on insights from cognitive <b>ergonomics.</b> Following the HIG, developers can create high-quality, consistent, and usable GUI programs, as it addresses everything from GUI design to recommended pixel-based layout of widgets.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} arrangements of alphabetic, numeric, and punctuation symbols on keys. These different keyboard layouts arise mainly because different people need easy access to different symbols, either because they are inputting text in different languages, or because they need a specialized layout for mathematics, accounting, computer programming, or other purposes. The United States keyboard layout is used as default in the currently most popular operating systems: Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. The common QWERTY-based layout was designed early in the era of mechanical typewriters, so its <b>ergonomics</b> were compromised to allow for the mechanical limitations of the typewriter.|$|E
25|$|By 1971, TVR {{wanted to}} {{introduce}} a more luxurious GT car, and they ultimately began {{to work on a}} prototype sports estate model. The styling was done by Harris Mann (who would later become known for the Triumph TR7 and Leyland Princess designs), and the engineering by Mike Bigland. The prototype body was built by Specialised Mouldings Ltd. of Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire on a TVR 2500 chassis. The car was given the development name 'SM' and was intended chiefly as a styling exercise with essentially no thought given to fitment of mechanical components or to driver <b>ergonomics.</b> The car appeared at the 1972 British Motor Show as an engineless show car.|$|E
25|$|In January 2008, French-based Thales Group won a US$2.9billion (€2billion) 20-year {{contract}} to supply avionics and navigation {{equipment for the}} A350 XWB, beating Honeywell and Rockwell Collins. US-based Rockwell Collins and Moog Inc were chosen to supply the horizontal stabiliser actuator and primary flight control actuation, respectively. The flight management system incorporated several new safety features. Regarding cabin <b>ergonomics</b> and entertainment, in 2006 Airbus signed a firm contract with BMW for development of an interior concept for the original A350. On 4 February 2010, Airbus {{signed a contract with}} Panasonic Avionics Corporation to deliver in-flight entertainment and communication (IFEC) systems for the Airbus A350 XWB.|$|E
25|$|The Ninja 300 {{is based}} on the Ninja 250R, a {{lightweight}} and inexpensive sport bike in production for over three decades. Like the Ninja 250R, it has a full fairing, but a wider rear tire, 140/70, than the instead of 130/70 on the 250R. The Ninja 300 also has a LED tail lamp, 5 spoke wheels, neutral finder, and optional ABS.By comparison with the 250R, the Ninja 300 also has a slightly smaller fuel tank, taller gearing, and a back-torque-limiting slipper clutch with an assist mechanism that decreases clutch lever effort. Despite being a sport bike, it has comfortable <b>ergonomics</b> (such as windscreen effectively protecting from wind blast) which promotes commuting.|$|E
25|$|The Prevé has {{received}} generally favourable reviews from critics in its domestic market. Malaysian automotive journalist Danny Tan from paultan.org commended the Prevé's looks, practicality, <b>ergonomics</b> and NVH attributes. The ride comfort and handling characteristics were exceptionally praised, in which Danny claimed was “unrivaled in the Asian C-segment sedan class”. However, the CamPro IAFM+ variants of the Prevé {{were not as}} well received {{in comparison with the}} turbocharged CamPro CFE model. The lack of power and torque from the IAFM+ engine was held responsible for poor acceleration and overall performance, but nonetheless competent in normal driving conditions. Danny also criticized some design flaws on the interior, such as the poorly designed head unit and instrument panel.|$|E
25|$|After the show, the car {{was renamed}} to 'Zante' (after the Greek island) and test driven by both Martin Lilley and Gerry Sagerman in the US. They agreed that the car's <b>ergonomics</b> and {{visibility}} were not suitable for a road car, and Sagerman further pointed out that it would need a V8 engine {{to be successful in}} the US market. Also considering the anticipated development costs for the pop-up headlamps, it was decided the project was not financially viable and the prototype remained the only Zante ever built. The body was removed from the chassis at Sagerman's facility and shipped back to Blackpool, where it was stored outside and left to deteriorate.|$|E
