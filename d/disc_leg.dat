Results. Seventy-three patients (55 %) were men, and 59 (45 %) were women. The mean age was 40 years, and 99 % of all herniated discs appeared at L 4 -L 5 (n = 60) or L 5 -S 1 (n = 71).

In subgroups of patients with larger leg length discrepancies, similar results were found but because of smaller sample sizes, these findings did not reach statistical significance. In 32 of the 57 men (56. 1 %), the pain radiated to the shorter leg (P = 0. 43); this was observed in 33 of the 47 women (70. 2 %; P = 0. 01). Conclusion.

40|$|AbstractThe {{imaginal discs}} of Drosophila are the larval {{primordia}} for the adult cuticular {{structures of the}} adult fly. Fate maps of different discs have been generated that show the localization of prospective adult structures. Even though the three legs differ in their morphology, only the fate map for the T 1 (prothoracic) <b>leg</b> <b>disc</b> has been generated. Here we present fate maps for the T 2 (meso-) and T 3 (metathoracic) <b>leg</b> <b>discs.</b> We show {{that there are many}} similarities to the map of the T 1 <b>leg</b> <b>disc.</b> However, there are also significant differences in the contributions of each disc to the thorax, in the morphology of joints connecting the legs to the thorax, in bristle patterns, and in the positioning of some sensory organs. We also tested the developmental potential of disc fragments and observed that T 2 and T 3 <b>leg</b> <b>discs</b> have more limited plasticity and are unable to transdetermine. The differences in the cuticle patterns between legs are robust and conserved in many species of dipterans. While most previous analyses of imaginal disc development have not distinguished between the different <b>leg</b> <b>discs,</b> we believe that the underlying differences of the three <b>leg</b> <b>discs</b> demonstrated here cannot be ignored when studying <b>leg</b> <b>disc</b> development...|$|R

40|$|SummaryOver 6, 000 {{fragments}} {{from the}} genome of Drosophila melanogaster were analyzed {{for their ability}} to drive expression of GAL 4 reporter genes in the third-instar larval imaginal discs. About 1, 200 reporter genes drove expression in the eye, antenna, leg, wing, haltere, or genital imaginal discs. The patterns ranged from large regions to individual cells. About 75 % of the active fragments drove expression in multiple discs; 20 % were expressed in ventral, but not dorsal, <b>discs</b> (<b>legs,</b> genital, and antenna), whereas ∼ 23 % were expressed in dorsal but not ventral discs (wing, haltere, and eye). Several patterns, for example, within the leg chordotonal organ, appeared a surprisingly large number of times.

40|$|AbstractWe {{have used}} the GAL 4 -UAS {{expression}} system to increase the level of expression of theDrosophilagenedecapentaplegic(dpp) in a pattern approximating its normal pattern in leg and wing imaginal discs. Intermediate increases ofdppexpression have little effect in wing discs but high levels ofdppoverexpression lead to reduction of the scutellum and duplication of posterior wing structures. In <b>leg</b> <b>discs</b> intermediate increases cause supernumerary outgrowths of ventral leg structures in the anterior–ventral region. Greater increases ofdppexpression cause the loss of ventral leg structures with the concomitant fusion of left and right dorsal forelegs. The defects observed in both legs and wings appear to arise through dose-dependent effects ofdpponwingless(wg) expression. A high level ofdppoverexpression in the wing disc causes reduction ofwgexpression in the presumptive scutellar region, consistent with the subsequent reduction of the scutellum. An intermediate increase ofdppexpression in <b>leg</b> <b>discs</b> induces the expansion ofwgexpression into the ventral outgrowths. At higherdppexpression levels, ventralwgexpression in <b>leg</b> <b>discs</b> is eliminated, consistent {{with the loss of}} ventral leg cuticle. In the <b>leg</b> <b>disc</b> end knob and in the wing margin primordium, wherewganddppcooperate in producing distal outgrowth,dppoverexpression has no detectable effect either on patterning or onwgexpression. We propose that a critical role fordppin other regions of the <b>leg</b> and wing <b>discs</b> is to reduce or block the expression ofwg. This role ofdppis supported by the observation that ectopicwgexpression is detected in imaginal discs wheredppsignaling is compromised by lowering the activity of one of its receptors,tkv. This antagonism betweendppandwgexpression may be critical to assigning only one disc region as the distal organizer...|$|R

40|$|AbstractImaginal discs of Drosophila {{have the}} {{remarkable}} ability to regenerate. After fragmentation wound healing occurs, ectopic wg is induced and a blastema is formed. In some, {{but not all}} fragments, the blastema will replace missing structures and a few cells can become more plastic and transdetermine to structures of other discs. A series of systematic cuts through the first <b>leg</b> <b>disc</b> revealed that a cut must transect the dorsal-proximal disc area and that the fragment must also include wg-competent cells. Fragments that fail to both transdetermine and regenerate missing structures will do both when provided with exogenous Wg, demonstrating the necessity of Wg in regenerative processes. In intact <b>leg</b> <b>discs</b> ubiquitously expressed low levels of Wg also leads to blastema formation, regeneration and transdetermination. Two days after exogenous wg induction the endogenous gene is activated, leading to elevated levels of Wg in the dorsal aspect of the <b>leg</b> <b>disc.</b> We identified a wg enhancer that regulates ectopic wg expression. Deletion of this enhancer increases transdetermination, but lowers the amount of ectopic Wg. We speculate that this lessens repression of dpp dorsally, and thus creates a permissive condition under which the balance of ectopic Wg and Dpp is favorable for transdetermination...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAntennapedia {{is one of}} the {{homeotic}} selector genes {{required for}} specification of segment identity in Drosophila. Dominant mutations that ectopically express Antennapedia cause transformation of antenna to leg. Loss-of-function mutations cause partial transformation of leg to antenna. Here we examine the role of Antennapedia in the establishment of leg identity in light of recent advances in our understanding of antennal development. In Antennapedia mutant clones in the <b>leg</b> <b>disc,</b> Homothorax and Distal-less are coexpressed and act via spineless to transform proximal femur to antenna. Antennapedia is negatively regulated during leg development by Distal-less, spineless, and dachshund and this reduced Antennapedia expression is needed for the proper development of distal leg elements.

In this report we demonstrate that reducing the gene copy number of Sp 1 significantly increases both the frequency and the area of transdetermination in regenerating <b>leg</b> <b>discs.</b> By examining the expression of known Sp 1 target genes, we also show that the proximo-distal patterning gene dachshund is downregulated dorsally, leading to a break in its normal ring-shaped expression pattern.

Combined, these studies establish a role for Sp 1 in leg-to-wing transdetermination...|$|R
40|$|The DC 2 gene was {{isolated}} previously {{on the basis}} of sequence similarity to DCO, the major Drosophila protein kinase A (PKA) catalytic subunit gene. We show here that the 67 -kD Drosophila DC 2 protein behaves as a PKA catalytic subunit in vitro. DC 2 is transcribed in mesodermal anlagen of early embryos. This expression depends on dorsal but on neither twist nor snail activity. DC 2 transcriptional fusions mimic this embryonic expression and are also expressed in subsets of cells in the optic lamina, wing <b>disc</b> and <b>leg</b> <b>discs</b> of third instar larvae. A saturation screen of a small deficiency interval containing DC 2 for recessive lethal mutations yielded no DC 2 alleles. We therefore isolated new deficiencies to generate deficiency trans-heterozygotes that lacked DC 2 activity. These animals were viable and fertile. The absence of DC 2 did not affect the viability or phenotype of imaginal disc cells lacking DC 0 activity or embryonic hatching of animals with reduced DC 0 activity. Furthermore, transgenes expressing DC 2 from a DC 0 promoter did not efficiently rescue a variety of DC 0 mutant phenotypes. These observations indicate that DC 2 is not an essential gene and is unlikely to be functionally redundant with DC 0, which has multiple unique functions during development...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{investigated}} {{the expression of}} segment polarity genes during the development of overgrowing and duplicating imaginal discs in the lethal overgrowth mutant lethal (2) giant discs (l(2) gd) of Drosophila in order to explore the molecular basis of hyperplasia and axis establishment in imaginal discs. The expression of wingless (wg), detected using an enhancer trap, is initially restricted to a ventral sector of the <b>leg</b> <b>disc,</b> as in wild type, but expands toward {{the opposite end of}} the disc during overgrowth. In the third <b>leg</b> <b>disc,</b> the expanding wg expression stripe evolves to a new center of wg expression at the site where a duplicate leg is subsequently formed. Expression of decapentaplegic (dpp) also begins normally in l(2) gd discs, but the dpp expression domain expands into the posterior region of the disc where it enlarges to eventually become the center of dpp expression in the duplicate. In l(2) gd 1 homozygotes that are simultaneously homozygous for wg or dpp mutations the <b>leg</b> <b>discs</b> overgrow but do not duplicate. Thus ectopic wg and dpp expression is associated with and appears to be required for disc duplication. The wing discs of l(3) gd 1 homozygotes also show expansion of the wg and dpp expression domains, but in this disc wg and dpp mutations inhibit overgrowth as well as pattern duplication. Our results raise the possibility that hyperplasia in other mutants and in other systems may be caused by the misexpression of genes involved in the generation of positional information...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackground: The {{appendages}} of insects, {{like the}} limbs of vertebrates, {{grow out of}} the body wall after {{the establishment of a}} proximo-distal axis among a group of primordial cells. In Drosophila, the wing develops in the limbless larva from one of the imaginal discs of the thorax, which give rise to the adult epidermis. The earliest identified requirement in wing development is for the induction of vestigial (vg) gene expression at the interface between ventral cells and dorsal cells of the wing disc. It has been proposed that this event requires two reciprocal signals — one from the dorsal to the ventral cells and the other from the ventral to the dorsal cells — which trigger vg expression at the presumptive wing margin and hence initiate the development of the wing tissue. Results We have identified four genes — Serrate (Ser), wingless (wg), Notch and Suppressor of Hairless (Su(H)) — whose activity is required during the second and early third larval instars for the expression of vg. Analysis of the functions and patterns of expression of these genes {{at the time of the}} inductive event indicates that the Ser protein acts as a dorsal signal, and the Wg protein as a ventral signal for the induction of vg expression. Furthermore, the expression of both Ser and Wg is sufficient to trigger ectopic wing development in the wing <b>disc</b> and <b>leg</b> <b>discs.</b> The product of the Notch gene, which encodes a receptor, is also required for this event and we suggest that its role is to integrate the inputs of Ser and Wg. Conclusion We show that the induction of vg, which initiates wing development in Drosophila, requires the combined activities of Ser, wg and Notch. Based on the patterns of expression and requirements for Ser and wg in this process, we propose that Ser is a dorsal signal and that Wg is a ventral signal, and that their combination at the dorso-ventral interface activates the Notch receptor and leads to vg expression...|$|R
40|$|Legs are {{locomotor}} appendages used by {{a variety}} of evolutionarily distant vertebrates and invertebrates. The primary biological leg function, locomotion, requires the formation of a specialised appendicular musculature. Here we report evidence that ladybird, an orthologue of the Lbx 1 gene recognised as a hallmark of appendicular myogenesis in vertebrates, is expressed in leg myoblasts, and regulates the shape, ultrastructure and functional properties of leg muscles in Drosophila. ladybird expression is progressively activated in myoblasts associated with the imaginal <b>leg</b> <b>disc</b> and precedes that of the founder cell marker dumbfounded. The RNAi-mediated attenuation of ladybird expression alters properties of developing myotubes, impairing their ability to grow and interact with the internal tendons and epithelial attachment sites. It also affects sarcomeric ultrastructure, resulting in reduced leg muscle performance and impaired mobility in surviving flies. The overexpression of ladybird also results in an abnormal pattern of dorsally located leg muscles, indicating different requirements for ladybird in dorsal versus ventral muscles. This differential effect is consistent with the higher level of Ladybird in ventrally located myoblasts and with positive ladybird regulation by extrinsic Wingless signalling from the ventral epithelium. In addition, ladybird expression correlates with that of FGF receptor Heartless and the read-out of FGF signalling downstream of FGF. FGF signals regulate the number of <b>leg</b> <b>disc</b> associated myoblasts and are able to accelerate myogenic differentiation by activating ladybird, leading to ectopic muscle fibre formation. A key role for ladybird in leg myogenesis is further supported by its capacity to repress vestigial and to down-regulate the vestigial-governed flight muscle developmental programme. Thus i...|$|R
40|$|Localized {{expression}} of the homeotic gene Antennapedia (Antp) in Drosophila melanogaster is required for normal development of the thoracic segments. When the Antp gene is expressed ectopically in the larval primordium of the antenna, the antennal imaginal disc, the developmental fate of the disc is switched and the adult antenna is transformed to a mesothoracic leg. We screened approximately 550 different fly strains carrying single copies of an enhancer-detector transposon to identify regulatory elements and corresponding genes that are either activated or repressed in antennal discs {{in response to this}} transformation. Several regulatory elements that are either direct or indirect targets of Antp were found. One transposant that expresses the reporter gene (lacZ) in the antennal disc, but not in the <b>leg</b> <b>disc,</b> was studied in more detail. The enhancer detector in this strain is located near a similarly regulated gene at the spalt (sal) locus, which encodes a homeotic function involved in embryonic head and tail development. The {{expression of}} this newly discovered gene, spalt major (salm) is strongly repressed in gain-of-function mutants that express Antp in the antennal disc. Recessive loss-of-function mutations (Antp-) have the opposite developmental effect; they cause the differentiation of antennal structures in the second <b>leg</b> <b>disc.</b> Accordingly, salm is derepressed in clones of homozygous Antp- cells. Therefore, we conclude that Antp negatively regulates salm. The time course of the interaction and reporter gene fusion experiments suggests (but does not prove) a direct interaction between Antp and cis-regulatory elements of salm.

To test this model we identified and characterized a dac cis-regulatory element (dac RE) that recapitulates dac's medial expression domain during leg development. Counter to the gradient model, we find that Wg and Dpp do not act in a graded manner to activate RE. Instead, dac RE is activated directly by Dll and repressed distally by a combination of factors, including the homeodomain protein Bar. Thus, medial leg fates are established via a regulatory cascade in which Wg+Dpp activate Dll and then Dll directly activates dac, with Wg+Dpp as less critical, permissive inputs...|$|R

Sp has both a recessive loss-of-function component and a gain-of-function component. The loss-of-function component reflects a reduction of wg activity in the notum and in the antenna. The gain-of-function component apparently leads to ectopic wg activity in the dorsal first and second <b>leg</b> <b>disc</b> and thereby generates the dominant Sp phenotype. Sp and other wg alleles show a complex pattern of complementation. We present evidence that these genetic properties are due to transvection. These results have implications for the genetic definition of a null allele at loci subject to transvection...|$|R
40|$|The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} distribution of RNA and protein encoded by the homeotic Sex combs reduced (Scr) gene were examined during Drosophila development. The gene products {{are present in the}} epidermis of both the labial and first thoracic segments as would be predicted from prior genetic studies. However, the pattern in the central nervous system (CNS) and mesoderm is further restricted; the major expression located in the labial neuromere of the CNS and the mesoderm of the first thoracic segment. The spatial restriction within the CNS is correlated with and may be due to a differential timing of expression in the labial and first thoracic ectoderm. The labial ectoderm accumulates the Scr RNA prior to segregation of the neuroblasts while expression in the first thoracic ectoderm occurs after neuroblast segregation. The protein is also observed in the subesophageal ganglia of both larvae and adults, {{as well as in the}} labial and first thoracic imaginal discs. Surprisingly, the protein is also present to a lesser extent in second and third thoracic <b>leg</b> <b>discs...</b>|$|R
40|$|Guanylyl cyclases (GCs), kind of {{enzyme-linked}} receptor proteins, play important physiological functions, including metamorphosis, olfactory {{organ and}} memory, in insects. The BdmGC- 1, a receptor form membrane guanylyl cyclase of Bactrocera dosalis (Hendel), {{has been proved}} its relationship with eclosion hormone. In this study, we furtherfound that the BdmGC- 1 was expressed in the B. dorsalis imaginal <b>discs</b> of wings, <b>legs</b> and compound eyes. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that new (1 -day-old) puparium exhibited higher expression level during metamorphosis. Moreover, immunofloruscent staining showed that the BdmGC- 1 signals were located in whole imaginal discs. Furthermore, recent studies have showed that p- 21 activated protein (PAK) can regulate the mammalian GC activity. Hence, we used a 280 -bp BdPAK, cloned from B. dorsalis based on PAK conserved regions, to analyze its expression and location. The results of both real-time PCR analysis and immunofloruscent staining showed that BdPAK has similar expression profiles with BdmGC- 1, implying that there some kind of relationships are existed between these two proteins. In summary, BdmGC- 1 is indeed expressed in the B. dorsalis wing, compound eye and <b>leg</b> <b>discs</b> and the newly pupated purarium have the higher expression level of BdmGC- 1. However, functional interaction of BdmGC- 1 with BdPAK {{has not yet been}} understood. 鳥苷酸環化酶（guanylyl cyclase, GC）為昆蟲體內一重要受器蛋白（receptor protein），許多生理功能都與其相關，例如變態、嗅覺和記憶等。東方果實蠅（Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) ）鳥苷酸環化酶，BdmGC- 1 ，已被證實為羽化激素（eclosion hormone）之受器蛋白，並發現其可能與昆蟲蛻皮行為有關。本研究更進一步發現BdmGC- 1 亦存在東方果實蠅幼蟲體內的翅成蟲盤（wing disc）、眼成蟲盤（eye disc）和足成蟲盤（leg disc）上。以real-time PCR 分析發現，蛹期第一天之翅、眼和足成蟲盤均有較高的BdmGC- 1 表現量；以免疫螢光染色（immunofluorescent stain）分析BdmGC- 1 在翅、眼和足成蟲盤表現位置，結果顯示其分布位於整個成蟲盤上。另外，從前人研究已知p- 21 activated protein（PAK）在哺乳動物上可調節GC 活性。因此，以PAK 保守區域選殖得到一長度 280 bp 的東方果實蠅部分PAK 序列，且命名為BdPAK。偵測其基因表現量和BdPAK螢光染色之結果顯示，BdPAK 之表現與位置與BdmGC- 1 皆類似，表示BdPAK 與BdmGC- 1 可能有某種關聯。綜合上述結果可知，BdmGC- 1 表現在翅、眼和足成蟲盤上並於蛹期第一天有較高表現，且可能與BdPAK 有某種關聯。中文摘要 [...] - i ABSTRACT [...] - ii 目錄 [...] -iii 圖表目次 [...] - v 前言 [...] - 1 前人研究 [...] - 2 一、	鳥苷酸環化酶之結構 [...] 2 二、	哺乳動物穿膜型GC [...] - 2 三、	Rac/PAK/GC/cGMP [...] - 3 四、	東方果實蠅鳥苷酸環化酶 [...] 4 五、	成蟲盤之結構與分化 [...] 5 六、	成蟲盤分化之機制 [...] - 6 七、	成蟲盤細胞增生調控 [...] 7 材料與方法 [...] 8 一、	試驗蟲體 [...] - 8 二、	RNA萃取 [...] - 8 三、	反轉錄作用連鎖聚合酶反應 [...] - 9 四、	PAK簡併引子之設計 [...] 10 五、	cDNA膠體電泳 [...] - 10 六、	cDNA回收 [...] 10 七、	cDNA選殖與定序 [...] - 11 八、	即時定量連鎖聚合酶反應 [...] - 12 九、	西方墨點法 [...] - 13 十、	組織免疫螢光染色 [...] 14 結果 [...] - 16 一、	翅、眼和足成蟲盤BdmGC- 1 mRNA與蛋白之偵測 [...] - 16 二、	翅、眼和足成蟲盤BdmGC- 1 於化蛹初期之表現 [...] - 16 三、	東方果實蠅BdPAK基因之選殖與表現 [...] 17 四、	翅、眼和足成蟲盤之BdmGC- 1 和BdPAK的蛋白質分布 [...] 17 討論 [...] - 19 一、	BdmGC- 1 於成蟲盤內的分布及各時期表現 [...] 19 二、	BdPAK於成蟲盤內的分布及各時期表現 [...] - 20 參考文獻 [...] - 23 表 [...] 26 圖 [...] 2...|$|R
40|$|Sex Combs Reduced (SCR) {{activity}} is proposed {{to be required}} cell nonautonomously for determination of tarsus identity, and Extradenticle (EXD) {{activity is}} required cell autonomously for determination of arista identity. Using the ability of Proboscipedia to inhibit the SCR activity required for determination of tarsus identity, we found that loss-of-EXD activity is epistatic to loss-of-SCR activity in tarsus vs. arista determination. This suggests that in the sequence leading to arista determination SCR activity is OFF while EXD activity is ON, and in the sequence leading to tarsus determination SCR activity is ON, which turns EXD activity OFF. Immunolocalization of EXD in early third-instar larval imaginal discs reveals that EXD is localized in the nuclei of antennal imaginal disc cells and localized in the cytoplasm of distal imaginal <b>leg</b> <b>disc</b> cells. We propose that EXD localized to the nucleus suppresses tarsus determination and activates arista determination. We further propose that in the mesodermal adepithelial cells of the <b>leg</b> imaginal <b>discs,</b> SCR {{is required for the}} synthesis of a tarsus-inducer that when secreted acts on the ectoderm cells inhibiting nuclear accumulation of EXD, such that tarsus determination is no longer suppressed and arista determination is no longer activated...|$|R
