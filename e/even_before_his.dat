5|$|<b>Even</b> <b>before</b> <b>his</b> {{accession}} {{to the throne}} of Belgium in 1865, the future king Leopold II began lobbying leading Belgian politicians to create a colonial empire in the Far East or Africa, which would expand and enhance Belgian prestige. Politically, however, colonisation was unpopular in Belgium as it was perceived as a risky and expensive gamble with no obvious benefit {{to the country and}} his many attempts to persuade politicians met with little success.|$|E
5|$|He {{supported}} {{the development of}} the sciences, particularly cartography; he hired a personal cartographer (Karol de Perthees) <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>his</b> election as king. A plan he initiated to map the entire territory of the Commonwealth, however, was never finished. At the Royal Castle in Warsaw, he organized an astronomical observatory and supported astronomers Jan Śniadecki and Marcin Odlanicki Poczobutt. He also sponsored historical studies, including the collection, cataloging and copying of historical manuscripts. He encouraged publications of biographies of famous Polish historical figures, and sponsored their paintings and sculptures.|$|E
5|$|The {{environment}} of the German Reeds' intimate theatre allowed Gilbert quickly to develop a personal style and freedom to control all aspects of production, including set, costumes, direction and stage management. These works were a success, with Gilbert's first big hit at the Gallery of Illustration, Ages Ago, opening in 1869. Ages Ago was also {{the beginning of a}} collaboration with the composer Frederic Clay that would last seven years and produce four works. It was at a rehearsal for Ages Ago that Clay formally introduced Gilbert to his friend, Arthur Sullivan. The Bab Ballads and Gilbert's many early musical works gave him much practice as a lyricist <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>his</b> collaboration with Sullivan.|$|E

5|$|Andrew II of Hungary was {{extremely}} favorably disposed towards the Templars. During {{his participation in}} the Fifth Crusade, he appointed Pontius de Cruce, Master of the Order in the Hungarian Kingdom, as a regent in Croatia and Dalmatia. After his return in 1219, {{in recognition of the}} great logistical and financial support which the Order had given him during the campaign, he granted the Order the estate of Gacka. <b>Even</b> <b>before</b> <b>his</b> departure from the city of Split in 1217, he had made over to the Templars the castle of Klis (Clissa), a strategic point in the hinterland of Split (Spalato), which controlled the approaches to the town. The king Andrew was reluctant to entrust the castle of Klis to any of the local magnates, knowing what great harm could come from that castle. It was the king's will that Split receive the castle of Klis for the defense of their city. The city of Split showed little interest in the royal favors, so the king entrusted Klis into Templars hands. Shortly after this, the Templars lost Klis, and, in exchange, the king gave them the coastal town of Šibenik (Sebenico).|$|E

25|$|The Iranian {{government}} {{claims that}} Bahá'ís are {{enemies of the}} state, were supporters of the former Shah's government and spies employed by imperialist governments of the West.

25|$|One of {{the oldest}} {{perceived}} literary examples of albino bias was H. G. Wells's depiction of the main character in his 1897 science-fiction novel The Invisible Man, {{who was able to}} become invisible using his scientific discoveries only because he already lacked natural pigmentation; aberrant <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>his</b> experimentation, he subsequently became completely deranged.|$|E

25|$|Blonger's health, poor <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>his</b> arrest, grew {{increasingly}} worse {{during the long}} trial.

Rocked by the revelation, he reconciled with his wife, transferring his property to her in anticipation of his incarceration.|$|E
25|$|For Lancashire and England, Briggs {{shouldered}} {{an incredible}} burden.

He toured Australia five times and went to South Africa, experiencing very high temperatures. Professional cricketers were expected to play through injuries, if they didn’t play, they would not be paid. His health suffered <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>his</b> infamous injury and last illness.|$|E

25|$|<b>Even</b> <b>before</b> <b>his</b> {{retirement}} from the NFL, Simpson {{embarked on a}} film career with parts in films such as the television mini-series Roots (1977), and the dramatic motion pictures The Klansman (1974), The Towering Inferno (1974), The Cassandra Crossing (1976), Capricorn One (1978), and the comedic Back to the Beach (1987) and The Naked Gun trilogy (1988, 1991, 1994). In 1979, he started his own film production company, Orenthal Productions, which dealt mostly in made-for-TV fare such as the family-oriented Goldie and the Boxer films with Melissa Michaelsen (1979 and 1981), and Cocaine and Blue Eyes (1983), the pilot for a proposed detective series on NBC.|$|E
25|$|Tsjalling Halbertsma's oeuvre {{was fairly}} limited, and {{consisted}} {{for a large}} part of rhymes written for the occasion of Shrove Tuesday and New Year, weigh-house notes, accompanying texts for prints, and fortune-telling notes, partly in West Frisian, but to a considerable degree, especially in the early years, in Dutch. Furthermore, it is known that, <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>his</b> brothers Justus and Eeltsje published their De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar in 1822, Tsjalling Halbertsma also wrote small tales and poems for a society in Grou. It is unclear what sort of society this was, but it seems very likely it was a remnant of a so-called 'people's society' from the French period, such as were established all over Friesland from 1795 on.|$|E
25|$|Despite Ling {{announcing that}} the team were looking for another {{promotion}} season, they were stuck in mid-table {{during the first half}} of the 2012–13 campaign, before Ling was taken ill in mid-January. A disastrous run of losses under assistant manager Shaun Taylor followed, with the club dropping to just above the relegation zone. That led to Alan Knill being appointed as interim manager for the remainder of the season. Results picked up after this, and a run of three games unbeaten at the end of the season ultimately secured their Football League status with a 19th-place finish. Ling was dismissed at the end of the season, the board noting that results had been unacceptable <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>his</b> illness, and Knill's role was made permanent.|$|E

25|$|In Cassius Dio’s account Caesar, who was {{governor}} in Hispania in 60 BC, considered his governorship as stepping-stone to the consulship. He left Hispania in a hurry, <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>his</b> successor arrived, {{to get to}} Rome {{in time for the}} elections. He sought the office before holding his triumph as {{it was too late to}} celebrate this before the elections. He was refused the triumph though Cato’s opposition. Caesar gave up the triumph, thinking that he could celebrate greater exploits if he was elected consul. He entered the city to canvass for office. He courted Crassus and Pompey so skilfully that he won them over, even though they were still hostile to each other, had their political clubs and ‘each opposed everything that he saw the other wished’.|$|E
25|$|He had {{difficulty}} adjusting to a vastly changed peacetime Army. In addition, Thompson's marriage had been troubled <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>his</b> captivity, {{and his wife}} Alyce, believing him dead, was living with another man {{at the time he}} was repatriated. He and his wife divorced in 1975. Alyce told author Tom Philpott that she believed prison had affected her husband's mind. She said he suffered from nightmares and was abusive towards both her and the children. Thompson later remarried but divorced soon afterwards. Thompson never formed any kind of a relationship with his children. His daughters were 6, 5 and 4 when he left, and his son was born the day of his capture. Only his eldest child barely remembered him. He eventually became completely estranged from all of them.|$|E
25|$|Noguchi {{left for}} Paris in April 1930, {{and two months}} later {{received}} his visa to ride the Trans-Siberian Railway. He opted to visit Japan first rather than India, but after learning that his father Yone did not want his son to visit using his surname, a shaken Noguchi instead departed for Beijing. In China, he studied brush painting with Qi Baishi, staying for six months before finally sailing for Japan. <b>Even</b> <b>before</b> <b>his</b> arrival in Kobe, Japanese newspapers had picked up on Noguchi's supposed reunion with his father; though he denied {{that this was the}} reason for his visit, the two did meet in Tokyo. He later arrived in Kyoto to study pottery with Uno Jinmatsu. Here he took note of local Zen gardens and haniwa, clay funerary figures of the Kofun period which inspired his terracotta The Queen.|$|E

He could not know it, but they were surprisingly graceful on his wiry, firm, white body.|$|R
