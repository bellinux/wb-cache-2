Even though implementation of such <b>E-Certificate</b> have been implemented around the globe, it has not been implemented for workshops in UiTM. User who owes an <b>E-Certificate</b> is able to retrieve from a web page and can be printed out. In order to handle the integrity issue, each certificate must be digitally signed by a signatory, and equivalent to hand signature. Digital Signature was encrypted by RSA Algorithm, a very powerful asymmetrical encryption. The system consist of a central database and organized into web page application which can be accessed by system admin, certificate user, and employer. In order to maintain the integrity of the <b>E-Certificate,</b> employers are allowed to verify the certificate in a specially made webpage to authenticate it. Web page application was programmed by Java Enterprise Edition (J 2 EE). Signatory however use a special Digital Signature Application which store the secret private key. The application was programmed by JAVA FX. The system was developed stage by stage as it is consist of many small components to form a large system. Therefore tests can be conducted as you develop the system. From tests, it was observed that all functions perfectly, accurately, and swiftly, indicating the advantages of an <b>E-Certificate</b> system...|$|E
40|$|E-Portfolios {{are being}} {{explored}} as {{an improvement over}} paper-based portfolios in the job and course application process. To be a true replacement for physical portfolios, e-Portfolios need to include an on-line version of certificates of the applicant's attainment. However, these “e-Certificates” present a number of practical challenges, so the validation of certificates of attainment which the students are presenting has not been addressed until now. This paper addresses the issues at stake, explores the gap between current e-Portfolio tools and an <b>e-Certificate</b> system, and presents an approach which solves the related problems. The recommendations from this research provide a reference from which <b>e-Certificate</b> implementations can be developed facilitating up take of e-Portfolio tools...|$|E
40|$|We all receive paper based {{certificates}} {{during our}} study journey, {{but they are}} hard to manage to avoid damage or loss. The field of e-learning provides technological developments, such as e-portfolios, which enable greater power and flexibility in displaying achievements. These may include on-line versions of certificates of the applicant's attainment which overcome the limitations of paper-based versions. However, these "e-certificates" present a number of practical challenges, which so far have not been addressed, such as the validation of claimed e-qualification certificates. This paper addresses the issues, and explores the gap between current e-portfolio tools and the desired e-qualification certificate system. Through analysis of the existing systems and <b>e-certificate</b> use cases, we have identified existing services that can be reused and the services that require further development, thereby presenting an approach which solves the above problems. Preliminary {{results indicate that the}} recommendation from this research meets the design requirements, and could form the foundation of future <b>e-certificate</b> implementations...|$|E
40|$|This work envisages {{minimizing}} many shortcomings including associated {{delays in}} the cargo clearance process when the import and export certificate which is legally known as license/permit become applicable. Preliminary survey conducted revealed that there is undue delay. The work then systematically identifies the factors that hamper efficient and effective enforcement of such regulations in the import and export of goods in the Sri Lankan context. A questionnaire was circulated among a sample of 100 importers and exporters or their representatives in order to gather information on ground level practical problems faced by them. Existing laws and regulations as well as regulatory processes at several agencies were examined to identify the correct legal position and any existing automated solutions. Various authorities were interviewed {{in order to identify}} their requirements as well as the problems they face. It was found that in almost all the instances manual procedures are in use in the issuance of certificates (licenses/permits) and in subsequent debit/write-off steps introducing delays, duplications and poor control effects. The study shows that certain commodities require certificates from more than one regulatory agency for identical purpose. It is recommended that Automated Certificate Processing System be put into use integrated with the existing Customs Automated System. It is also recommended that the simplification and standardizing of procedures at regulatory agencies as well as at Customs need to be carried out before introducing an automated system. Proposed <b>e-Certificate</b> system will not only expedite the clearance process but also will prevent the certificates being misused. Much superior controls could be implemented as online information will be available for all regulatory agencies. Main goal of the proposal is to eliminate paper requirement and pave the way for paperless trade in Sri Lanka...|$|E
