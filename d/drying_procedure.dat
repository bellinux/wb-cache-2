40|$|We have {{increased}} the efficiency for containing and transferring pollen during chemical <b>drying</b> <b>procedures</b> for conventional scanning electron microscope (CSEM) viewing by replacing standard laboratory containers (glass test tubes, pipettes, etc.) in the final drying stage with smoothed and polished metallic conical wells. The wells, formed by drilling into one end of aluminum CSEM specimen holders, are approximately 4 mm deep, 8 mm in top diameter, and 1 mm in bottom diameter. The large surface area allows rapid elimination of dehydrant. Unlike standard containers, to which dry pollen sticks after evaporation or sublimation of dehydrant, the wells allow pollen to be easily collected, concentrated, and transferred to CSEM specimen holders with minimal loss of sample. The conical wells have been used with alcohol, Peldri-II, and hexamethyldisilazane <b>drying</b> <b>procedures</b> and therefore, universal application seems likely...|$|R
40|$|Shrinkage of dentine and the {{decrease}} in its weight after drying were measured. Three <b>drying</b> <b>procedures</b> were used, freeze-drying and drying in nitrogen at 60 and 100 degrees C. The dentine was subsequently rehydrated while measuring its dimensions. Rehydrated dentine was weighed. Dentine weight decreased by 10. 2, 9. 0 and 10. 5 % with the three different <b>drying</b> <b>procedures.</b> Shrinkage was about equal with all three methods. Linear dimensional changes were 1. 7 - 2. 0 % in the plane perpendicular to the tubules and 1. 4 - 1. 7 % {{in the direction of}} the tubules. During rehydration, freeze-dried dentine and dentine dried at 60 degrees C regained its original wet dimensions and weight. Dentine dried at 100 degrees C showed some permanent shrinkage and weight loss...|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{have been}} {{conducted}} to validate the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) <b>drying</b> <b>procedures</b> for preparation of corroded aluminum plate fuel for dry storage in an existing vented (and filtered) fuel storage facility. A mixture of hydrated aluminum oxide bound with a clay was used to model the aluminum corrosion product and sediment expected in these Department of Energy (DOE) owned fuel types. Previous studies demonstrated that the current <b>drying</b> <b>procedures</b> are adequate for removal of free water inside the storage canister and for transfer of this fuel to a vented dry storage facility. However, using these same <b>drying</b> <b>procedures,</b> the simulated corrosion product {{was found to be}} difficult to dry completely from between the aluminum clad plates of the fuel. Another related set of experiments was designed to ensure that the fuel would not be damaged during the drying process. Aluminum plate fuels are susceptible to pitting damage on the cladding that can result in a portion of UAl{sub x} fuel meat being disgorged. This would leave a water-filled void beneath the pit in the cladding. The question was whether bursting would occur when water in the void flashes to steam, causing separation of the cladding from the fuel, and/or possible rupture. Aluminum coupons were fabricated to model damaged fuel plates. These coupons do not rupture or sustain any visible damage during credible drying scenarios...|$|R
50|$|If {{equipment}} is reused within a process, the minimum cycle-time becomes {{more dependent on}} particular process details. For example, if the <b>drying</b> <b>procedure</b> in the current example is replaced with another reaction in the reactor, the minimum cycle time depends on the operating policy and on the relative durations of other procedures. In the cases below, {{an increase in the}} hold time in the tote can decrease the average minimum cycle time.|$|E
50|$|Some {{additional}} form {{of chemical}} preservative, such as sodium nitrite, {{is often used}} in conjunction with the historical salted <b>drying</b> <b>procedure</b> to prepare jerky. Smoking is the most traditional method, as it preserves, flavors, and dries the meat simultaneously. Salting is the most common method used today, as it both provides seasoning to improve the flavor as well as preserve the meat. While some methods involve applying the seasonings with a marinade, this can increase the drying time by adding moisture to the meat.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} work, authors {{produced}} tablets of anhydrous sodium naproxen by wet granulation using a high-shear mixer-granulator. Drug hydrated to the tetrahydrated form, as observed by X-ray powder diffractometry. After wet granulation, authors then performed two different <b>drying</b> <b>procedures,</b> obtaining granules of different water content and crystallographic characteristics. The first <b>procedure</b> <b>dried</b> granules in the high-shear mixer-granulator by applying vacuum {{at room temperature}} (batch A), while the second employed the same apparatus and time, under vacuum at 408 C (batch B). X-ray powder diffractometry revealed that the sodium naproxen (SN) contained in batch A granules {{was a mixture of}} dihydrated and tetrahydrated forms (as demonstrated by the coexistence of peaks typical of both hydrated forms), while that of batch B granules was a mixture of monohydrated and tetrahydrated forms. This means that differences in <b>drying</b> <b>procedures</b> could lead to products of different crystallographic properties. The behavior under compression was evaluated, revealing that batch A offered the best tabletability and compressibility. These results make it possible to conclude that differences in the crystallographic properties and water content of SN are such that different hydration/drying processes can alter the drug crystal form and thus the tabletability of the resulting granules...|$|R
50|$|Electronic {{functionality}} and printability {{can interfere}} with each other, mandating careful optimization. For example, a higher molecular weight in polymers enhances conductivity, but diminishes solubility. For printing, viscosity, surface tension and solid content must be tightly controlled. Cross-layer interactions such as wetting, adhesion, and solubility as well as post-deposition <b>drying</b> <b>procedures</b> affect the outcome. Additives often used in conventional printing inks are unavailable, because they often defeat electronic functionality.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} peracetic acid-based (PAA) {{disinfectant}} with, and without, additional drying on Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, isolated from contaminated flexible endoscopes, in single-and dual-species biofilms were studied. Biofilms were prepared in sterile tissue culture polystyrene 96 -well microtitre plates and were quantified using the tetrazolium salt (MTT) reduction assay and by counting colony-forming yeasts and bacteria from 10 -fold serial biofilm dilutions on agar plates. An in vitro biofilm model {{was applied to}} mimic the biofilm formation inside the endoscope channels and to imitate the disinfection and drying procedures used for reprocessing of flexible endoscopes. The PAA-based disinfectant was effective against bacteria and yeasts in the planktonic and biofilm states directly after treatment, but allowed regrowth of all biofilms if the <b>drying</b> <b>procedure</b> was skipped. No biofilm regrowth occurred in wells after a <b>drying</b> <b>procedure</b> in all single-and dual-species biofilms. Routine cleaning procedures do not remove biofilm reliably from endoscope channels if the accurate <b>drying</b> <b>procedure</b> is not applied. This may explain the failure of decontamination during endoscope reprocessing. (C) 2010 The Hospital Infection Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Soil-water {{retention}} curves (SWRCs) can {{be determined}} using high-suction tensiometers (HSTs) following two different procedures that involve either continuous or discrete measurement of suction. In the former case, suction measurements are taken while the sample is permanently exposed to the atmosphere and the soil is continuously drying. In the latter case, the drying or wetting process is halted at different stages to ensure equalization within the sample before measuring suction. Continuous drying {{has the advantage of}} being faster; however, it has the disadvantage that the accuracy of mass measurements (necessary for the determination of water content) is affected by the weight and stiffness of the cable connecting the HST to the logger. To overcome this problem, an alternative continuous <b>drying</b> <b>procedure</b> is presented in this paper in which two separate but nominally identical samples are used to obtain a single SWRC; one sample is used for the mass measurements, while a second sample is used for suction measurements.

40|$|Model {{membrane}} {{approaches have}} {{attracted much attention}} in biomedical sciences to investigate and simulate biological processes. The application of model membrane systems for biosensor measurements is partly restricted {{by the fact that}} the integrity of membranes critically depends on the maintenance of an aqueous surrounding, while various biosensors require a preconditioning of dry sensors. This is for example true for the well-established surface acoustic wave (SAW) biosensor SAM® 5 blue. Here, a simple <b>drying</b> <b>procedure</b> of sensor-supported model membranes is introduced using the protective disaccharide trehalose. Highly reproducible model membranes were prepared by the Langmuir-Blodgett technique, transferred to SAW sensors and supplemented with a trehalose solution. Membrane rehydration after dry incorporation into the SAW device becomes immediately evident by phase changes. Reconstituted model membranes maintain their full functionality, as indicated by biotin/avidin binding experiments. Atomic force microscopy confirmed the morphological invariability of dried and rehydrated membranes. Approximating to more physiological recognition phenomena, the site-directed immobilization of the integrin VLA- 4 into the reconstituted model membrane and subsequent VCAM- 1 ligand binding with nanomolar affinity were illustrated. This simple <b>drying</b> <b>procedure</b> is a novel way to combine the model membrane generation by Langmuir-Blodgett technique with SAW biosensor measurements, which extends the applicability of SAM® 5 blue in biomedical sciences...|$|E
