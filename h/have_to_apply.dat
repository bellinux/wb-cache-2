5|$|Since 2008, the zoo {{has been}} {{lobbying}} for {{a permit to}} build an eagle sanctuary {{in order to be}} able to distribute the animals' feathers to tribal members for ceremonial purposes in accordance with federal law. Since the species are listed as endangered, any remains of dead animals are confiscated by the federal government and transported to a central repository in Colorado; members of Native American Indian nations then <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> individually to receive parts, such as feathers, in a lengthy process with wait-times that can exceed several years. Since a tribally operated eagle sanctuary constitutes an exception to the process, it would be instrumental in strengthening Navajo cultural sovereignty; currently, only the Iowa and Zuni nations operate eagle sanctuaries for this purpose.|$|E

25|$|The Schutzstaffel (SS) used a more {{stringent}} standard: In order to join, a candidate {{had to prove}} (presumably through baptismal records) that all direct ancestors born since 1750 were not Jewish, or they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> for a German Blood Certificate instead. Later, when the stresses of the war made it implausible to confirm the ancestry of officer candidates, the extended proof of ancestry regulation was diminished to the standard laws requiring certified evidence of non-Judaism within two generations.|$|E
25|$|For {{the gravity}} {{below the surface}} we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> the free-air {{correction}} {{as well as a}} double Bouguer correction. With the infinite slab model this is because moving the point of observation below the slab changes the gravity due to it to its opposite. Alternatively, we can consider a spherically symmetrical Earth and subtract from the mass of the Earth that of the shell outside the point of observation, because that does not cause gravity inside. This gives the same result.|$|E

25|$|Some BBSes, called elite, WaReZ or pirate boards, were {{exclusively}} {{used for}} distributing cracked software, phreaking, and other questionable or unlawful content. These BBSes often had multiple modems and phone lines, allowing several users to {{upload and download}} files at once. Most elite BBSes used some form of new user verification, where new users would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> for membership and attempt {{to prove that they}} were not a law enforcement officer or a lamer. The largest elite boards accepted users by invitation only. Elite boards also spawned their own subculture and gave rise to the slang known today as leetspeak.|$|E
25|$|The East German {{government}} eventually {{sought to}} defuse the situation by relaxing the country's border controls. The intention was to allow emigration to West Germany but only after an application had been approved, and similarly to allow thirty-day visas for travel to the West, again on application. Only four million GDR citizens had a passport, so only that number could take immediate advantage of such a change; the remaining 13million would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> for a passport and then wait at least four weeks for approval. The new regime would go into effect from 10November 1989.|$|E
25|$|The Asia Minor Expedition and Catastrophe, {{as well as}} the {{uprooting}} of {{the ethnic}} Greek population from Anatolia after three thousand years of presence, had an enormous impact on the Greek psyche. The Smyrna Catastrophe has been considered as the worst incident of modern Greek history, and as an incident of the same magnitude as the Fall of Constantinople for the Greeks. The matters related to the refugees halted the Greco-Turkish relations for many decades. The issues concerning the missing Greeks were soon raised in the International Red Cross, without any success and cooperation from the Turkish side. To this day, the Greek citizens who were born in Asia Minor <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> for a visa in order to enter Turkey (something that does not apply to Greek citizens born in Greece).|$|E

25|$|On 23 June 2016, the British {{electorate}} {{voted to}} leave the European Union in a nationwide referendum in England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Gibraltar. The UK sent notification of their intention {{to leave the}} EU to the European Council through Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. After notifying the European Council, the UK has two years to negotiate with other member states until it leaves, and British citizens will only then cease to be citizens of the European Union. British citizens will still have the right of freedom of movement until the UK formally leaves. It has since been suggested that British citizens wishing to travel to EU countries may <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> for a visa or apply online for an American style ESTA visa waiver and pay a fee in order to enter the country of destination.|$|E
25|$|Proponents of the RMA {{argue that}} it ensures the {{sustainable}} use of resources for the foreseeable needs of {{the present and future}} generation, and also recognises the importance of indigenous rights in the mitigation process. In this respect, the RMA is a pioneering act in the area of sustainable development. Other advantages cited are the umbrella function, which (at least in theory) allows all consent decisions about a project to be considered in one process, freeing applicants from the need to research and apply for all the various permits they would otherwise <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> for their development. It is also noted that the RMA is 'effects-based'. In other words, instead of a proposal needing to be on a list of approved or permitted developments or activities, if the applicant can prove that the 'effects' of the development on the environment are unproblematic, then he or she is allowed to go ahead. In practice however, this proof is often elusive, especially with new or contested activities or developments.|$|E
25|$|The Communist Party came {{to power}} in the late 1940s and instituted a command economy. In 1958, Mao Zedong, the Chairman of the Communist Party of China, created a {{residency}} permit system defining where people could work, and classified workers as rural or urban. In this system, a worker seeking to move from the country to an urban area to take up non-agricultural work would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> through the relevant bureaucratic institutions. There is uncertainty, however, over how strictly the system has been enforced. People who worked outside the region in which they were registered would not qualify for grain rations, employer-provided housing, or health care. There were controls over education, employment, marriage and other areas of life. One reason cited for instituting this system was to prevent the possible chaos caused by predictable large-scale urbanization. As a part of the one country, two systems policy proposed by Deng Xiaoping and accepted by the British and Portuguese governments, the special administrative regions (SARs) of Hong Kong and Macau retained separate border control and immigration policies {{with the rest of the}} PRC. Chinese nationals had to gain permission from the government before travelling to Hong Kong or Macau, but this requirement was officially abolished for each SAR after its respective handover. Since then, restrictions imposed by the SAR governments have been the limiting factor on travel.|$|E

25|$|Foreign (non-US citizen) {{students}} applying {{from another}} country form a large and growing percentage of applicants (including accepted applicants) to American universities. According to Andover counseling director Sean Logan, applications to American universities from foreign students have increased dramatically in the past decade. International applications are typically similar to domestic ones but with additional complications. Most international applicants do not receive a GPA score or transcript from their school. Most will not normally take SAT or ACT exams, so these must be arranged. Most American universities are happy to accept international and foreign qualifications such as the International Baccalaureate or IB, or British A Levels, although it is often up to the applicant to elaborate {{on the meaning of}} these qualifications. Non-native English speakers may be asked to provide English language qualifications. If a university requires or offers an interview, these can normally be conducted over the phone or with alumni residing in the applicant's country, according to Uni in the USA, a guide book catering to the growing number of British students seeking to study in the United States. International applicants often must cope with higher tuition fees and less available financial aid, although this varies significantly by college. Further, international applicants also <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> for a student visa, which can be a complex and time-consuming process.|$|E
500|$|Although the Workington {{team was}} close {{to the bottom of the}} Third Division North, Shankly saw it as a {{challenge}} and [...] "he attacked the job with all the enthusiasm and relish he always showed at whatever he did".

In 1954–55, the team finished a creditable eighth and saw a rise in attendances from 6,000 to 8,000.|$|E
500|$|Star Trek was the series' biggest {{grossing}} film at {{the domestic}} box-office in the United States, {{resulting in a}} sequel being greenlit by the studio and Kurtzman and Orci being asked to write it. The studio set aside a larger budget for the sequel, which was revealed by Orci {{in an interview with}} TrekMovie.com. Orci ruled out the [...] "hero quitting" [...] staple of a second movie, which had featured in the Transformers sequel, saying that the crew of the Enterprise were committed and that type of story does not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> to all sequels. During the buildup to the film, called Star Trek Into Darkness, Orci was one of the production team who didn't give much away about the villain in the film and denied that Benedict Cumberbatch was to play Khan Noonian Singh.|$|E

500|$|For instance, while {{traveling}} in a moving vehicle at a [...] velocity, {{the laws of}} physics do not change {{as a result of its}} motion. If a person riding within the vehicle throws a ball straight up, that person will observe it rise vertically and fall vertically and not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> a force in the direction the vehicle is moving. Another person, observing the moving vehicle pass by, would observe the ball follow a curving parabolic path in the same direction as the motion of the vehicle. It is the inertia of the ball associated with its constant velocity in the direction of the vehicle's motion that ensures the ball continues to move forward even as it is thrown up and falls back down. From the perspective of the person in the car, the vehicle and everything inside of it is at rest: It is the outside world that is moving with a constant speed in the opposite direction of the vehicle. Since there is no experiment that can distinguish whether it is the vehicle that is at rest or the outside world that is at rest, the two situations are considered to be physically indistinguishable. Inertia therefore applies equally well to constant velocity motion as it does to rest.|$|E
500|$|Lady Hale {{was also}} {{concerned}} about the ramifications of the decision. [...] She asked if a doctor treating a patient after an accident and giving evidence about what happened as well as his opinions as to what would happen would be covered or not, or whether only in part. She noted that the ruling in the case would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> to experts dealing with cases before tribunals as well as courts, thus including claims for unfair dismissal before employment tribunals and disputes between landlord and tenants about service charges and rent assessments. [...] She queried whether it ought to extend to psychiatrists assessing patients for tribunal proceedings under the Mental Health Act 1983, or educational psychologists giving evidence about children with special educational needs in tribunal proceedings about their future education. In her view, these are [...] "sensitive and often highly fraught cases in which performing the expert's duty to the tribunal may well be perceived by the client patient or parent as a breach of her duty towards him." [...] In family law cases, she said, there would now be some professional witnesses who had immunity from negligence claims for their evidence and others who did not, with some of the distinctions between the two groups appearing to be [...] "arbitrary". She thought that the decision might make experts more likely to confirm their previous views rather than change them, and could lead to higher insurance premiums for experts, increased fees and the use of exemption clauses in contracts – [...] "in which case we shall be back where we started", she said. Overall, she called the decision to change the law [...] "irresponsible" [...] and, like Lord Hope, considered that the topic was best left to Parliament and the Law Commission.|$|E
