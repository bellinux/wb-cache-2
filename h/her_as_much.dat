5|$|In 1937 Reich {{began an}} affair with a female patient, an actress who had been married to a {{colleague}} of his. According to Sigurd Hoel, the analysis would stop because of the relationship, then the relationship would end and the analysis would start up again. The patient eventually threatened to go to the press, but was persuaded that it would harm <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as it would Reich. Around the same time, Reich also had {{an affair with}} Gerd Bergersen, a 25-year-old Norwegian textile designer.|$|E
5|$|Dickinson started {{school at}} Manton Primary in Worksop while his parents moved away to Sheffield. Soon afterwards, {{when he was}} six, he was also {{despatched}} to Sheffield, where he attended a primary school in Manor Top. After six months, his parents decided to move him to a small private school called Sharrow Vale Junior. Due to constant moving, Dickinson states that this period of his life taught him to be self-reliant as {{he was unable to}} make close friends. Dickinson has a younger sister, professional showjumper , who was born in 1963. He tried to isolate himself from <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as he could when he was young, supposedly out of spite because she, unlike him, was a planned pregnancy and birth.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} the spirits, the Ghost of Christmas Past, takes Scrooge to Christmas scenes of Scrooge's boyhood and youth, {{reminding}} him {{of a time when}} he was more innocent. The boyhood scenes portray Scrooge's lonely childhood, his relationship with his beloved sister Fan, and a Christmas party hosted by his first employer, Mr. Fezziwig, who treated Scrooge like a son. They also portray Scrooge's neglected fiancée Belle, who ends their relationship after she realises that Scrooge will never love <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as he loves money. Finally, they visit a now-married Belle with her large, happy family on a recent Christmas Eve.|$|E

5|$|Her {{mother told}} Copeland {{that she would}} have to give up ballet, but Bradley wanted Copeland to {{continue}} and offered to host her. DelaCerna agreed to this, and Copeland moved in with Bradley and her family. Eventually, Copeland and DelaCerna signed a management contract and a life-story contract with Bradley. Copeland spent the weekdays with the Bradleys near the coast and the weekends at home with her mother, a two-hour bus ride away. Copeland would spend most of her next three years with the Bradleys. By the age of fourteen, Copeland was the winner of a national ballet contest and won her first solo role. The Bradleys introduced Copeland to books and videos about ballet. When she saw Paloma Herrera, a principal ballerina with ABT, perform at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Copeland began to idolize <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as she did Mariah Carey. The media first noticed her when she drew 2,000 patrons per show as she performed as Clara in The Nutcracker at the San Pedro High School after only eight months of study. A larger role as Kitri in Don Quixote at the San Pedro Dance Center and a featured role in The Chocolate Nutcracker, an African American version of the tale, narrated by Debbie Allen, soon followed. The latter was presented at UCLA's Royce Hall. Copeland's role was modified especially for her, and included ethnic dances.|$|E
25|$|Hillary Clinton managed {{an upset}} win over Barack Obama in New Hampshire, despite polls showing <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as 13 points {{behind in the}} run-up to the vote. The win helped Clinton get back some of the {{momentum}} she lost the week before when Obama carried the Iowa caucuses—though Obama did eventually win the Democratic nomination. John McCain won the Republican primary, sparking an unexpected comeback for the senator whose long-shot campaign had been written off as a lost cause months before. He went on to win the GOP nomination.|$|E
25|$|La Fayette, one of {{the former}} {{military}} leaders in the American War of Independence (1775–83), served as the warden {{of the royal family}} in his position as commander-in-chief of the Garde nationale. Despite his dislike of the queen—he detested <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as she detested him and at one time had even threatened to send her to a convent—he was persuaded by the mayor of Paris, Jean Sylvain Bailly, to work collaborate with her, and allowed her to see Fersen a number of times. He even went as far as exiling the Duke of Orléans, who was accused by the queen of fomenting trouble. His relationship with the king was more cordial. As a liberal aristocrat he did not want the fall of the monarchy but rather the establishment of a liberal one, {{similar to that of the}} United Kingdom, based on cooperation between the king and the people, as was to be defined in the Constitution of 1791.|$|E

25|$|In 1884, {{she began}} work on Little Lord Fauntleroy with the {{serialization}} beginning in 1885 in St. Nicholas, and the publication in book form in 1886. Little Lord Fauntleroy received good reviews, became a best-seller in the United States and England, was translated into 12 languages, and secured Burnett's reputation as a writer. The story features a boy who dresses in elaborate velvet suits and wears his long hair in curls. The central character, Cedric, was modeled on Burnett's younger son Vivian, and the autobiographical aspects of Little Lord Fauntleroy occasionally led to disparaging remarks from the press. After the publication of Little Lord Fauntleroy, Burnett's reputation as a writer of children's books was fully established. In 1888 she won a lawsuit in England over the dramatic rights to Little Lord Fauntleroy, establishing a precedent that was incorporated into British copyright law in 1911. In response to a second incident of pirating her material into a dramatic piece, she wrote The Real Little Lord Fauntleroy, which was produced on stage in London and on Broadway. The play went on to make <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> money as the book.|$|E

500|$|The {{painting}} {{known as}} Queen Elizabeth going in procession to Blackfriars in 1601, or simply The Procession Picture [...] (see illustration), is now often accepted {{as the work}} of Peake. The attribution was made by Roy Strong, who called it [...] "one of the great visual mysteries of the Elizabethan age". It {{is an example of the}} convention, prevalent in the later part of her reign, of painting Elizabeth as an icon, portraying <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> younger and more triumphant than she was. As Strong puts it, [...] "his is Gloriana in her sunset glory, the mistress of the set piece, of the calculated spectacular presentation of herself to her adoring subjects". George Vertue, the eighteenth-century antiquarian, called the painting [...] "not well nor ill done".|$|E

500|$|In {{the opening}} scene of the episode, {{instead of the usual}} theme song, a {{sequence}} {{similar to that of the}} 1977 CBS series The Incredible Hulk is played, with Stewie portraying Bruce Banner, Tom Tucker portraying Mr. McGee, and Peter portraying Hulk. After Lois meets Joyce Kinney at the local supermarket, the two decide to meet up at the news studio later that evening. Admitting her enjoyment of their friendship, Lois continually praises Joyce for her celebrity status, calling <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> of a bigshot as The Muppets character Miss Piggy. The scene then cuts to Kermit the Frog, who has been badly beaten, with Fozzie Bear approaching him about a proposed [...] "Bears in Space" [...] number. Kermit then reveals that the skit has been changed to [...] "Pigs in Space" [...] instead.|$|E
500|$|With the {{emergence}} of feminist criticism in academia in the 1960s and 1970s, Wollstonecraft's works returned to prominence. Their fortunes reflected that of the second wave of the North American feminist movement itself; for example, in the early 1970s, six major biographies of Wollstonecraft were published that presented her [...] "passionate life in [...] to [...] radical and rationalist agenda". The feminist artwork The Dinner Party, first exhibited in 1979, features a place setting for Wollstonecraft. In the 1980s and 1990s, yet another image of Wollstonecraft emerged, one which described <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> more a creature of her time; scholars such as Claudia Johnson, Gary Kelly, and Virginia Sapiro demonstrated the continuity between Wollstonecraft's thought and other important eighteenth-century ideas regarding topics such as sensibility, economics, and political theory.|$|E
500|$|When Windsor {{took over}} the role in 1994, she was unhappy with the way Peggy was being scripted. She has commented, [...] "a few things weren't quite right about Peggy at the beginning. On a purely {{superficial}} level, the wig didn't fit right. And the clothes weren't right either. They appeared too downmarket. I was particularly worried about how the character was viewed by the producer and writers. I saw <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> ballsier than they did. I think they envisioned Peggy as this rather sad, vulnerable lady who spent all her time worrying about her children." [...] However, early in 1995, EastEnders acquired a new executive producer, Corinne Hollingworth, who shared Windsor's vision of Peggy. It was Hollingworth who decided that Peggy would be a central character, the new landlady of The Queen Victoria public house, one of the soap's main focal points. Hollingworth stated that Peggy was [...] "not {{going to be allowed}} to just sit in some flat polishing her nails". Windsor has said: [...] "It was like a dream. [...] let me go out with the costume designer and choose Peggy's wardrobe, which needed {{to be a lot more}} flash and upmarket. Corinne and I worked on getting Peggy right and I finally began to believe...".|$|E

500|$|Romano {{described}} Kim as a [...] "very ambitious, very skilled, very smart" [...] character, {{and attempted}} to make <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> of a role model as possible. The actress also described the character as [...] "a really confident, sweet girl who everybody loves. And she is a heroine who little girls look up to. ... She is a typical role model, perfect in every way. How could you not like Kim?" [...] Romano initially doubted that the show would be successful, but eventually admitted that [...] "the animation was great and the writing was amazing. It's done so that kids and adults can enjoy it; families can share an amazing experience together." [...] Additionally, Romano's character greatly influenced her own career, and considers Kim {{to be a positive}} role model for young girls. Romano identified the season one episode [...] "Mind Games" [...] in which Kim and Ron switch bodies as her favorite. By the end of the series, Romano was 21 years old and attending Columbia University for political science. Kim's final line in the series is [...] "uuhhh...huh?", which Romano recorded tearfully due to the series ending. Writing for 7M Pictures, Kevin Carr considered the fact that Kim is only a voice-acted role beneficial to the series because [...] "they could always get someone else to mimic her original voice" [...] should Romano depart, unlike Lizzie McGuires Hilary Duff.|$|E

2500|$|When {{production}} of the show ended in 1963, Billingsley had become typecast as saccharine sweet and had trouble obtaining acting jobs for years. She traveled extensively abroad until the late 1970s. After an absence of 17 years from the public eye (other than appearing in two episodes of The F.B.I. in 1971), Billingsley spoofed her wholesome image with a brief appearance in the comedy Airplane! (1980), as a passenger who could [...] "speak jive." [...] She stated that the role gave <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> publicity as Beaver, and revived her career.|$|E

Daniel was invited to lunch with the Willis family and he tried his best to impress Terese, but soon realised that it was Imogen's father, Brad (Kip Gamblin), that he needed approval from. Daniel's efforts to impress Brad went wrong when he caused [...] "an unsettling incident" [...] that suddenly ended the lunch.|$|E
2500|$|The Guardians Mikki Kendall wrote, [...] "In 'Flawless' (a {{track that}} leaked as 'Bow Down' over the summer), Beyonce quotes from author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's TedX talk 'We {{should all be}} feminists', adroitly {{addressing}} {{the idea that she}} is somehow anti-feminist for not fitting into the boxes others project onto her. It's clear that like a lot of black American women, the mainstream middle class white feminist narratives with which we are so familiar aren't necessarily compatible with Beyonce's view of herself. This album makes it clear that her feminism isn't academic; isn't about waves, or labels. It simply is a part of <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as anything else in her life. She's pro-woman without being anti-man, and she wants the world to know that you can be feminist on a personal level without sacrificing emotions, friendships or fun." ...|$|E
