50|$|Players {{can also}} block attacks {{in order to}} reduce damage. If the attack is blocked at the same time an attack connects, that hit in the attack is nullified, the SP and extra meters are {{significantly}} filled, and the next attack will be a guaranteed critical hit. This is known as a <b>flash</b> <b>guard.</b> Getting the timing wrong in a <b>flash</b> <b>guard</b> attempt will result in the player taking more damage than if the player does not attempt to block.|$|E
50|$|A flash suppressor, {{also known}} as a <b>flash</b> <b>guard,</b> flash eliminator, flash hider, or flash cone, is a device {{attached}} to the muzzle of a rifle that reduces its visible signature while firing by cooling or dispersing the burning gases that exit the muzzle, a phenomenon typical of carbine-length weapons. Its primary intent is to reduce the chances that the shooter will be blinded in low-light shooting conditions. Contrary to popular belief, it is only a minor secondary benefit if a flash suppressor reduces the intensity of the flash visible to the enemy.|$|E
50|$|Ys Seven reintroduces {{the ability}} to {{actively}} block, introduces skills, introduces stun meters for enemies, introduces weapon types, introduces super combos known as EXTRA skills, and introduces {{the ability to}} parry hits from attacks with a <b>flash</b> <b>guard</b> system. Failed flash guards result in the player character taking extra damage compared to failing to defend at all. Memories of Celceta introduces a flash dodge where a player character dodges just before a hit. A successful flash dodge results in time slowing down for the enemy whose attack was just avoided.|$|E

The vow that manacled my rage is loosed; Even {{heaven is}} wearied with {{repeated}} crimes, Till lightning <b>flashes</b> round, to <b>guard</b> the throne, And the curbed thunder grumbles to be gone.|$|R
5000|$|Key game system {{improvements}} {{include an}} easier [...] "step" [...] and [...] "avoid" [...] systems, arena walls (rather than ring-out ability on all sides) and wall-specific moves, a three-step Soul Charge system, a clash {{system that is}} used when two attacks would hit each other resulting in a white <b>flash,</b> <b>Guard</b> Break attacks which put a blocking player into a post guard-impact state, just frame moves awarding additional hits to players who could time their command inputs well, and a revised Guard Impact system that removed height-based Impact moves and instead used a more unified system (high and mid attacks are countered using Repels, mid and low attacks are countered using Parries).|$|E
40|$|Purely {{hydrodynamic}} numerical experiments {{into the}} evolution of astrophysical discs typically include some sort of viscosity in order to cause accretion. In this paper, we demonstrate an alternative method of implementing viscous forces, with extremely good angular momentum conservation properties. The method is based on altering the cell fluxes, rather than incorporating a viscous force. We test this method on the classical `ring spreading' problem, and demonstrate angular momentum conservation at the $ 10 ^{- 8 }$ level.

After being subdued by the Flashmen, Mag is reprogramed to assist them. He upgrades the prisms in their helmets {{to give them}} stronger prism weapons when the Mess officers power up, Mag can also pilot the Star Condor as seen in an episode where Jin Needs parts for his Flash Hawk.|$|R

Uniforms <b>flash</b> upon the <b>guards,</b> for no campaign is complete without the military. Here are brave companies of the Douglas Guards, the Hickory Sprouts, and the Little Giants to do honor to the person of their hero. Cannon are booming as he steps into his open carriage that evening on the levee, where the piles of river freight are covered with people. Transparencies are dodging in the darkness. A fresh band strikes up [...] "Hail Columbia," [...] and the four horses prance away, followed closely by the [...] "Independent Broom Rangers." [...] "The shouts for Douglas," [...] remarked a keen observer who was present, [...] "must have penetrated Abraham's bosom at Springfield." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the DVD version, a {{new device}} is shown. To {{the control room}} elevator's right is a {{telescope}} with two wooden crates holding lenses underneath. Placing the right amount and sequence of lenses in the scope reveals a watchtower in Matia's harbor flashing a bulb under {{it in a way}} reminiscent of Morse code. All this forms one of two puzzles, required to have the <b>guard</b> <b>flashing</b> the bulb to raise a docking ring and let the Living Ship extend its main tentacle so that Matia's Zone is reachable. Back inside the control room, after this event, a separate control panel there is now usable. Zooming in reveals a circular ring-similar to those used to enter coordinates-with a small knob lever that turns to indicate the number of light flashes, twelve tiny knobs to indicate either [...] "-" [...] or [...] ".", and a button to play your Morse feedback signal, as flashes of neon green light. This is reminiscent of the Navy Signal lamp, in an automated design. However, attempting to repeat the code does nothing. At this point, an Argilan woman appears to explain what your task is, in her own native tongue, and fails. Angela Davies then ports in, explaining that your code must be in its [...] "negative" [...] form, both type and order. (from [...] "-" [...] to [...] "." [...] and vice versa) Finishing that results in access to Matia.|$|R
