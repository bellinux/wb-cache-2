50|$|Hide glue {{is used in}} woodworking. It may be {{supplied}} as granules, flakes, or flat sheets, which have an indefinite shelf life if kept dry. It is dissolved in water, heated and applied warm, typically around 60°C (140°F). Warmer temperatures quickly destroy the strength of hide <b>glue.</b> Commercial <b>glue</b> <b>pots,</b> simple water baths or double boilers {{may be used to}} keep the glue hot while in use. As hide glue cools, it gels quickly. At room temperature, prepared hide glue has the consistency of stiff gelatin, which is in fact a similar composition. Gelled hide glue does not have significant strength, so it is vital to apply the glue, fit the pieces, and hold them steady before the glue temperature drops much below 50°C (120°F). All glues have an open time, the amount of time the glue remains liquid and workable. Joining parts after the open time is expired results in a weak bond. Hide glue's open time is usually a minute or less. In practice, this often means having to heat the pieces to be glued, and gluing in a very warm room, though these steps can be dispensed with if the glue and clamp operation can be carried out quickly.|$|R

50|$|It {{has several}} {{advantages}} and disadvantages compared to other glues. The glue is applied hot, typically with a brush or spatula. Glue is kept hot in a <b>glue</b> <b>pot,</b> which may be an electric unit built for the purpose, a double boiler, or simply a saucepan or crock pot to provide a warm water bath for the container of glue.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Great Fire" [...] of 9 June 1846 in St. Johns {{started at}} the shop of a cabinetmaker named Hamlin, located on George Street off Queen Street, when a <b>glue</b> <b>pot</b> boiled over. The fire killed one artilleryman and two civilians, and burned large {{portions}} of the town, including burning all but one mercantile warehouse in the River area.|$|E
50|$|Seattle's first {{buildings}} were wooden. On June 6, 1889 at 2:39 in the afternoon, a cabinetmaker (Jonathan Edward Back), accidentally overturned and ignited a <b>glue</b> <b>pot.</b> An attempt to extinguish {{it with water}} spread the burning grease-based glue. The fire chief was out of town, and although the volunteer fire department responded they {{made the mistake of}} trying to use too many hoses at once. With the subsequent drop in water pressure none of the hoses were effective and the Great Seattle Fire destroyed 31 blocks.|$|E
50|$|The early Seattle era {{came to a}} {{stunning}} halt with the Great Seattle Fire of June 6, 1889. Started by a <b>glue</b> <b>pot,</b> the fire burned 29 city blocks (almost entirely wooden buildings; about 10 brick buildings also burned). It destroyed nearly the entire business district, all of the railroad terminals, and all but four of the wharves. Major fires like this were common in Washington that summer: the center of Ellensburg was destroyed by fire on July 4 and downtown Spokane burned on August 4.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 17th century, the King's Head began taking {{delivery}} of mail, which was dropped by horsemen through a hatch behind the mirrors. The room {{is called the}} 'Glue Pot' as mail was once sorted and stamped here. Beneath a range of meat hooks is a square patch where the hole for the post would have been dropped into the <b>Glue</b> <b>Pot.</b> It is just the right height for a mail delivery on horseback. The cobbled passage leads into the courtyard {{that dates back to}} the early 14th century when it was the original market square. There are three layers of cobblestones.|$|E
5000|$|The Great Fire of 1846 {{occurred}} in St. John's, Newfoundland, {{a colony of}} the United Kingdom on 9 June 1846. The fire started at the shop of a cabinetmaker named Hamlin, located on George Street off Queen Street, when a <b>glue</b> <b>pot</b> boiled over. The fire spread along Water and Duckworth Streets destroying all of the buildings in its path aided by the large quantities of seal oil that were stored in the merchants' premises. The fire was also aided by an attempt {{to blow up a}} house on Water Street which scattered burning embers across the city.|$|E
5000|$|A Victorian socialite, Lady Filmer {{produced}} several albums {{consisting of}} watercolour scenes decorated with photomontages. One of her works (from the so-called Filmer Album) depicts a drawing room, painted in watercolour, {{in which she}} has added photographic cut-outs from albumen silver prints. She positions herself next to a large figure of the Prince of Wales, with whom she was known to flirt. Her albums and <b>glue</b> <b>pot</b> are {{set out on a}} large table beside her. Much smaller, Sir Edmund Filmer, her husband, is seated next to a pet dog. In 2010, the work was included in an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art titled [...] "Playing With Pictures: The Art of Victorian Photocollage".|$|E
40|$|The {{recent review}} of the Lopingian (upper Permian) stratigraphic {{framework}} of the Galilee Basin, prompted a reconsideration of the paleo-environments of deposition. This study interpreted the distribution of sedimentary facies from geophysical logs across the basin complemented by detailed logging from four key wells (GSQ Tambo 1 - 1 A, OEC <b>Glue</b> <b>Pot</b> Creek 1, CRD Montani 1 and GSQ Muttaburra 1). Seven facies associations were identified: terrestrial fluvial, floodplain, lacustrine and mire; and paralic to marine estuarine shoreline, delta and restricted marine. Coal measures (mire facies) are best developed in the northeastern margin of the basin, whereas the southern Springsure Shelf was dominated by marine conditions throughout the Lopingian, only developing terrestrial facies towards the very uppermost Lopingian. The ‘Colinlea Sandstone equivalent’ was deposited in a fluvial system, with tidal influence exhibited {{in the southern part}} of the basin, which decreases further north as lacustrine environments become common. The regional transgression represented by the Black Alley Shale can be mapped into the central part of the basin, but based on new exploration data its northern extent is more limited than previously thought. The ‘Burngrove Formation equivalent’ and Bandanna Formation represent a southerly prograding fluvial-deltaic system during the regional regression in the upper part of the Lopingian...|$|E
