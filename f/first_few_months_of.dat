5|$|Carl Hans Lody, alias Charles A. Inglis (20 January 1877 – 6 November 1914; name {{occasionally}} {{given as}} Karl Hans Lody), was a reserve {{officer of the}} Imperial German Navy who spied in the United Kingdom in the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> the First World War.|$|E
5|$|This {{action was}} {{one of a series of}} skirmishes known as the Forage War that persisted in {{northern}} New Jersey through the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> 1777, and it demonstrated that militia companies were capable of putting up a significant fight.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> the First English Civil War {{although}} Worcester {{changed hands}} three times, only one musket shot was fired, so until {{the start of}} the short unsuccessful siege of May 1643 the medieval walls were not subjected to bombardment by an early modern artillery train.|$|E

5|$|Factors that {{increase}} the risk of polio infection or affect the severity of the disease include immune deficiency, malnutrition, physical activity immediately following the onset of paralysis, skeletal muscle injury due to injection of vaccines or therapeutic agents, and pregnancy. Although the virus can cross the maternal-fetal barrier during pregnancy, the fetus {{does not appear to be}} affected by either maternal infection or polio vaccination. Maternal antibodies also cross the placenta, providing passive immunity that protects the infant from polio infection during the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> life.|$|E
5|$|Minority Report {{was one of}} {{the best}} {{reviewed}} films of 2002 and was nominated for several awards. It received an Academy Award nomination for Best Sound Editing, and eleven Saturn Award nominations, including Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, and Saturn Award for Best Music, winning Best Science Fiction Film, Best Direction, Best Writing, and Best Supporting Actress. The film was a commercial success, earning over $358 million worldwide against an overall budget of $142 million (including advertising). Over four million DVDs were sold in its <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> home release.|$|E
5|$|Ridership {{initially}} {{fell short}} of forecasts, but grew from fewer than 40,000 passengers per day in the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> operation to over 129,000 passengers per day in June 2013. Daily passenger traffic reached 130,000 in 2014, well below the forecast of 240,000 daily passengers for 2008. The system carried its first 100 million passengers by August 2010 and over 200 million passengers had taken the system by December 2012., followed by 400 million by December 2016.|$|E
50|$|The Rancho Los Amigos Scale is {{a complex}} scale that has eight {{separate}} levels, and is often used in the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> weeks or <b>months</b> <b>of</b> coma while the patient is under closer observation, and when shifts between levels are more frequent.|$|R
5000|$|Very severe SMA (type 0/1) can be {{sometimes}} evident {{before birth}} - reduction in fetal {{movement in the}} final <b>months</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy. Otherwise SMA1 manifests within the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> weeks or <b>months</b> <b>of</b> life when abnormally low muscle tone is observed in the infant (the [...] "floppy baby syndrome").|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{effect of}} vitamin A supplementation on the {{survival}} of infants aged < 6 mo is unclear. Because most infant deaths occur in the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>month</b> <b>of</b> life, maternal supplemen-tation may improve infant survival. Objectives: The objective {{was to assess the}} effect of maternal vitamin A or b-carotene supplementation on fetal loss and sur-vival of infants < 6 mo of age. Design: Married women of reproductive age in 270 wards of Sarlahi district, Nepal, were eligible to participate. Wards were randomly assigned to have women receive weekly doses of 7000 mg retinol equivalents as retinyl palmitate (vitamin A), 42 mg all-trans-b-carotene, or placebo. Pregnancies were followed until miscarriage, stillbirth, maternal death, or live birth of one or more infants, who were followed through 24 wk of age. Results: A total of 43559 women were enrolled; 15832 con-tributed 17373 pregnancies and 15987 live born infants to the trial. The rate of fetal loss was 92. 0 / 1000 pregnancies in the placebo group, comparable with rates in the vitamin A and b-carotene groups, which had relative risks of 1. 06 (95 % CI: 0. 91, 1. 25) and 1. 03 (95 % CI: 0. 87, 1. 19), respectively. The 24 -wk mortal-ity rate was 70. 8 / 1000 live births in the placebo group, compa-rable with rates in the vitamin A and b-carotene groups, whic...|$|R
5|$|Robson met Elsie Gray on a {{trip back}} to his parents' home in Langley Park. She was a student nurse, and later a teacher. They were married in June 1955 and Fulham {{teammate}} Tom Wilson was Robson's best man. After 1991, Robson was repeatedly diagnosed as suffering from cancer. He had several operations and, in 2006, was operated on for a brain tumour. This, on occasion, affected his work; while at Porto, for example, Robson suffered from malignant melanoma, which resulted in his missing the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> the 1995–96 season.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> the 2009 {{season the}} Mets and Phillies {{looked as though}} they would make this year into another close playoff race. By the end of May the Mets had won three out of the four games they played against each other; however, the Phillies {{retained}} a half game lead. Both clubs struggled in June as the Phillies slumped and the New York became plagued with injuries. By the end of June the Phillies had increased their division lead, but only to {{two and a half}} games.|$|E
5|$|After Romania {{joined the}} war {{on the side of}} the Triple Entente in August and was quickly overrun by the Central Powers, the Russian efforts in the Black Sea in the second half of 1916 were focused in the west. Because German {{submarines}} never really accomplished all that much in the Black Sea, the February 1917 resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare led the Germans to temporarily abandon the Black Sea in lieu of the more target-rich Mediterranean. UB-14s whereabouts and activities during the latter half of 1916 and the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> 1917 are unreported in sources.|$|E

The role is not mentioned after the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> weeks or <b>months</b> <b>of</b> the run. Jessie Bond in her autobiography mentions her spoonerism [...] "The missus is having such a cow with the rabman", which comes from this piece.|$|R
5|$|The {{acute phase}} lasts for the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> weeks or <b>months</b> <b>of</b> infection. It usually occurs unnoticed {{because it is}} symptom-free or {{exhibits}} only mild symptoms that are not unique to Chagas disease. These can include fever, fatigue, body aches, muscle pain, headache, rash, loss of appetite, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. The signs on physical examination can include mild enlargement of the liver or spleen, swollen glands, and local swelling (a chagoma) where the parasite entered the body.|$|R
50|$|For {{allergic}} disease, {{the most}} important times for exposure are: early in development; later during pregnancy; and the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> days or <b>months</b> <b>of</b> infancy. Exposure needs to be maintained over a significant period. This fits with evidence that delivery by Caesarean section {{may be associated with}} increased allergies, whilst breastfeeding can be protective. The extent to which exposures need to be maintained after infancy and whether these conditions could be managed by on-going exposure is as yet unknown.|$|R
5|$|After an {{educational}} trip to Rome, {{undertaken in the}} <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> 1859, he spent the summer of that year studying at the University of Edinburgh under, among others, the chemist Lyon Playfair. In October, he matriculated as an undergraduate at Christ Church, Oxford. Now released from the educational strictures imposed by his parents, he enjoyed studying {{for the first time}} and performed satisfactorily in examinations. In 1861, he transferred to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was tutored in history by Charles Kingsley, Regius Professor of Modern History. Kingsley's efforts brought forth the best academic performances of Edward's life, and Edward actually looked forward to his lectures.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} ruminants, the infant can stand within 30 minutes of birth. Although {{generally}} similar to adults, newborn calves have false eyelashes, a long dorsal mane and long white hairs in the stripes. These features gradually disappear and {{give way to}} the general appearance within a year. The juveniles are kept in hiding, and nursing takes place infrequently. The growth rate of calves is appreciably high in the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> birth, after which it gradually declines. Juveniles start taking solid food from three months, and weaning takes place at six months. Horn development in males takes one year after birth. The okapi's average lifespan is 20 to 30 years.|$|E
5|$|HMS Hero was an H-class {{destroyer}} {{built for}} the Royal Navy in the mid-1930s. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939 the ship enforced the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides {{as part of the}} Mediterranean Fleet. During the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> World War II, Hero searched for German commerce raiders in the Atlantic Ocean and participated in the Second Battle of Narvik during the Norwegian Campaign of April–June 1940 before she was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in May where she escorted a number of convoys to Malta. The ship took part in the Battle of Cape Spada in July 1940, Operation Abstention in February 1941, and the evacuations of Greece and Crete in April–May 1941.|$|E

5000|$|In July 1943 Paul Marion, the Vichy Propaganda Minister, began a {{nationwide}} recruitment for the Waffen-SS in France. The Comité des Amis de la Waffen S.S. (Committee of the Friends of the Waffen-SS) {{was established by}} the minister and proceeded to actively recruit men who were {{between the ages of}} 20-25, [...] "free of Jewish blood," [...] and physically fit. Roughly 3000 applied to the assorted offices in the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months,</b> many <b>of</b> them college students. The organization also spent much time trying to recruit experienced French officers, like Fenet, to the organization. In October 1943, Fenet volunteered for the Waffen-SS and was sent to the SS school at Bad Tölz. In March 1944 he received the rank of Obersturmführer (senior assault leader, equivalent of first lieutenant) in the Waffen-SS and was given command of a company of the newly formed 8th SS Assault Brigade Frankreich.|$|R
50|$|A poorly {{functioning}} {{pituitary gland}} may also cause {{a lack of}} thyroid hormone, leading to central hypothyroidism. Thyroid hormone is critical for growth and brain development, especially during the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> weeks to <b>months</b> <b>of</b> life. Children with untreated hypothyroidism {{are at high risk}} of mental retardation; thus, early detection is crucial. Central hypothyroidism can be diagnosed by a low or normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) {{in the presence of a}} low level of free T4. Free T-4 should be checked annually for at least four years.|$|R
5|$|HMS Hunter was a H-class {{destroyer}} {{built for}} the Royal Navy in the mid-1930s. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939 the ship enforced the arms blockade imposed on both sides by Britain and France, until she struck a mine in May 1937. She was under repair {{for the next year}} and a half, after which she rejoined the Mediterranean Fleet. During the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> World War II, Hunter searched for German commerce raiders in the Atlantic Ocean until she was transferred back to Britain in February 1940. Returning to action in the Norwegian Campaign, she was sunk by German destroyers during the First Battle of Narvik in April 1940.|$|E
5|$|Maxinquaye was {{released}} on 20 February 1995 and sold over 100,000 copies in its <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> release in the UK, despite no significant radio airplay. The record charted for 35 weeks on the British albums chart, peaking at number three. After it {{was released}} in the US on April 18, Tricky toured {{the country as a}} supporting act for fellow English recording artist PJ Harvey. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the album had sold 222,000 copies in the US by 2003. By 2012, it had sold over 500,000 copies worldwide. That same year, Tricky performed the entire album with Topley-Bird on April 27 at the Sundance London festival, which was their first onstage appearance together in 15 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{intention}} for the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> {{development was}} for the game to be an on-rails shooter similar to Sega's light gun game Virtua Cop; GoldenEyes gas plant location was modelled by Karl Hilton with a predetermined path in mind. Although GoldenEye is controlled with a pad rather than a light gun, Hollis credited Virtua Cop as an influence on the developers' adoption of features such as gun reloading, position-dependent hit reaction animations, penalties for killing innocent characters, and an alternative aiming system that is activated upon pressing the R button of the Nintendo 64 controller.|$|E
50|$|Infantile hemangiomas {{typically}} {{develop in}} the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> weeks or <b>months</b> <b>of</b> life. They are more common in Caucasians, in premature children whose birth weight is less than 3 lb, in females, and in twin births. Early lesions may resemble a red scratch or patch, a white patch, or a bruise. The majority of hemangiomas occur {{on the head and}} neck, but they can occur almost anywhere. The appearance and color of the hemangioma depends on its location and depth within the level of the skin.|$|R
5000|$|Released {{independently}} in February 1995, River Songs {{was originally}} rejected by several major record companies, But after selling over 10,000 copies in its <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months,</b> some <b>of</b> these same companies began pursuing the Badlees. One {{of these companies}} was A&M Records, who expressed interest in signing the band after a Philadelphia-based executive noticed the inordinate amount of airplay this independent band was getting on Pennsylvania radio stations. The songs primarily receiving airplay were [...] "Angeline Is Coming Home", a song by Mike Naydock about a heroin addict returning from rehab, and Bret Alexander's [...] "Fear of Falling", which would eventually be used by NBC during coverage of the 1996 Olympics. The Badlees were ultimately signed to the A&M subsidiary label, Polydor/Atlas. The deal was for two albums, a future album and River Songs, which was accepted by the company [...] "as is", with no further production required for the national release. The record went on to sell 250,000 copies.|$|R
25|$|The {{lifespan}} {{of patients}} with NPC is usually related {{to the age of}} onset. Children with antenatal or infantile onset usually succumb in the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> or years <b>of</b> life, whereas adolescent and adult onset forms of Niemann–Pick type C have a more insidious onset and slower progression, and affected individuals may survive to the seventh decade. Adult cases of NPC are being recognized with increasing frequency. It is suspected that many patients affected by NPC are undiagnosed, owing to lack of awareness of the disease and the absence of readily available screening or diagnostic tests. For the same reasons the diagnosis is often delayed by many years.|$|R
5|$|During Victoria's first {{pregnancy}} in 1840, in the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> the marriage, 18-year-old Edward Oxford {{attempted to}} assassinate {{her while she}} was riding in a carriage with Prince Albert {{on her way to}} visit her mother. Oxford fired twice, but either both bullets missed or, as he later claimed, the guns had no shot. He was tried for high treason, found not guilty on the grounds of insanity, and committed to an insane asylum indefinitely. In {{the immediate aftermath of the}} attack, Victoria's popularity soared, mitigating residual discontent over the Hastings affair and the bedchamber crisis. Her daughter, also named Victoria, was born on 21 November 1840. The Queen hated being pregnant, viewed breast-feeding with disgust, and thought newborn babies were ugly. Nevertheless, over the following seventeen years, she and Albert had a further eight children: Albert Edward, Prince of Wales (b. 1841), Alice (b. 1843), Alfred (b. 1844), Helena (b. 1846), Louise (b. 1848), Arthur (b. 1850), Leopold (b. 1853) and Beatrice (b. 1857).|$|E
5|$|During the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> 1967, the Viet Cong absorbed {{heavy losses}} {{as a result}} of {{large-scale}} search and destroy missions conducted by the United States Army, and it prompted North Vietnamese leaders to review their war strategy in South Vietnam. In light of the setbacks which North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces had experienced early in 1967, North Vietnamese General Trần Văn Trà suggested that North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces could still be victorious if they inflicted as many casualties as possible on U.S. military units, hoping that the Americans would conclude that the war was too costly and withdraw from Vietnam. Thus, towards mid-1967, the Viet Cong 7th and 9th Divisions returned to the battlefield again, with the objective of inflicting casualties on U.S. military formations in III Corps Tactical Zone. On June 12, the U.S. 1st Infantry Division launched Operation Billings to destroy elements of the Viet Cong 9th Division, which had built-up strength around northern Phuoc Vinh.|$|E
5|$|Falling {{electricity}} production may be boosted through drilling additional supply boreholes, as at Poihipi and Ohaaki. The Wairakei power station {{has been running}} much longer, with its first unit commissioned in November 1958, and it attained its peak generation of 173MW in 1965, but already the supply of high-pressure steam was faltering, in 1982 being derated to intermediate pressure and the station managing 157MW. Around {{the start of the}} 21st century it was managing about 150MW, then in 2005 two 8MW isopentane systems were added, boosting the station's output by about 14MW. Detailed data are unavailable, being lost due to re-organisations. One such re-organisation in 1996 causes the absence of early data for Poihipi (started 1996), and the gap in 1996/7 for Wairakei and Ohaaki; half-hourly data for Ohaaki's <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> operation are also missing, as well as for most of Wairakei's history.|$|E

30|$|Morquio A syndrome, or {{mucopolysaccharidosis}} IVA (MPS IVA), is an {{autosomal recessive}} lysosomal storage disorder caused by defective activity of N-acetyl-galactosamine- 6 -sulfatase (GALNS), an enzyme that catabolizes the glycosaminoglycans keratan sulfate and chondroitin- 6 -sulfate. Symptoms typically become apparent during the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> or years <b>of</b> life, as intracellular glycosaminoglycan accumulation progressively affects skeletal structure, connective tissues and organs. Over 275 mutations in the GALNS gene {{have been identified}} to date, resulting in wide phenotypic variability [1, 2, 3, 4]. The condition is rare, with estimates of incidence ranging from one in 76, 000 live births in Northern Ireland [5] to one in 640, 000 live births in Western Australia [6].|$|R
