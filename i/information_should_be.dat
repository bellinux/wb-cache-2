25|$|This {{has caused}} an ongoing debate and {{struggle}} over how UFC sensitive <b>information</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> handled, {{and who may}} view it.

25|$|The {{threat model}} for OFFICIAL data {{is similar to}} typical large private-sector organisations; it anticipates that {{individual}} hackers, pressure groups, criminals, and investigative journalists might attempt to get information. The threat model does not guarantee protection against very persistent and skilled attacks, for instance by organised crime groups or by foreign governments; these are possible, but normal controls would make them more difficult, and much stronger controls would be disproportionate. People with routine access to OFFICIAL <b>information</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> subject to BPSS screening.|$|E
25|$|Third, the Articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights {{were to be}} used as much as {{possible}} as a guideline for all aspects of camp life. This meant that no one was to be removed by force from an UNBRO camp for any reason; free thought, free speech and free access to education and <b>information</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> guaranteed for all; the camps should be free of political or any other kind of coercion; and protection and justice for camp residents should be provided by the Khmer Police and an internal justice system.|$|E

25|$|The Nixon {{administration}} {{struggled to}} decide what materials to release. All parties involved agreed that all pertinent <b>information</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> released. Whether to release unedited profanity and vulgarity divided his advisers. His legal team favored releasing the tapes unedited, while Press Secretary Ron Ziegler preferred using an edited version where “expletive deleted” would replace the raw material. After several weeks of debate, they decided to release an edited version. Nixon announced {{the release of the}} transcripts {{in a speech to the}} nation on April 29, 1974. Nixon noted that any audio pertinent to national security information could be redacted from the released tapes.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the commercially}} {{available}} prescription diabetes foods {{are high in}} fiber, complex carbohydrates, and have proven therapeutic results. Of primary concern is getting or keeping the animal eating, as use of the prescribed amount of insulin is dependent on eating full meals. When no meal is eaten, {{there is still a}} need for a basal dosage of insulin, which supplies the body's needs without taking food into consideration. Eating a partial meal means a reduction in insulin dose. Basal and reduced insulin dose <b>information</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> part of initial doctorclient diabetes discussions in case of need.|$|E
25|$|The {{results on}} the inquiry were {{released}} on 25 November 2014 three months later. Ms Gwyn found that the SIS gave information to John Key's office from where his {{deputy chief of staff}} Phil de Joux passed it on to another John Key employee, Jason Ede. Mr Ede contacted Cameron Slater and they then discussed how an Official Information Act request for the <b>information</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> worded. Slater emailed the request while they were still talking on the phone and also provided Slater with draft blog posts attacking Mr Goff. Cameron Slater subsequently used the information to attack former Labour leader, Phil Goff, on his blog.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{entities}} {{in possession}} of medical records are required to maintain those records for a given period. In the United Kingdom, medical records are required for the lifetime of a patient and legally {{for as long as}} that complaint action can be brought. Generally in the UK, any recorded <b>information</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> kept legally for 7 years, but for medical records additional time must be allowed for any child to reach the age of responsibility (20 years). Medical records are required many years after a patient’s death to investigate illnesses within a community (e.g., industrial or environmental disease or even deaths at the hands of doctors committing murders, as in the Harold Shipman case).|$|E

Calibrated dates can also be expressed as BP instead of using BC and AD. The curve used to calibrate the results should be the latest available INTCAL curve. Calibrated dates should also identify any programs, such as OxCal, used to perform the calibration. [...] In addition, an article in Radiocarbon in 2014 about radiocarbon date reporting conventions recommends that <b>information</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> provided about sample treatment, including the sample material, pretreatment methods, and quality control measurements; that the citation to the software used for calibration should specify the version number and any options or models used; and that the calibrated date should be given with the associated probabilities for each range.|$|E

After all, access to <b>information</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> free and total, right? Or at least that's how the mythology goes." [...] An update to Branwyn's Beyond Cyberpunk! hyper-card stack included a new introduction, which referred to the Cyberpunk controversy, frankly stating [...] "The release of Billy Idol's album Cyberpunk was met with a hailstorm of controversy on the Net, as young cyber-Turks whined about how he had ripped them off and destroyed their secret club." ...|$|E

500|$|Hastert was {{initially}} {{represented in the}} civil case by his son, attorney Ethan Hastert, and then by Christian Poland, a Bryan Cave partner in Chicago. U.S. District Judge Charles Kocoras twice dismissed the suit, but allowed John's attorneys to redraft the complaint. In July 2015, Kocoras reinstated the suit, finding that John's second amended complaint was sufficient to allow the suit to go forward and proceed to discovery. John claimed in court filings to {{have had at least}} three conversations with an FBI agent about Hastert's use of the post-speakership office. In September 2015, Hastert's attorneys issued subpoenas for records of conversations between John and FBI agents. John's attorneys moved to quash the subpoenas, arguing that they were overly broad and sought information [...] "unrelated to the present case or Hastert." [...] In October 2015, Judge Kocoras said that he would review the records in camera (privately) before deciding what <b>information</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> turned over, saying: [...] "This case has {{more than its share of}} sensitivity and unusual aspects." ...|$|E

2500|$|Accountability is {{preserved}} {{by a number}} of procedural and substantive requirements that must be satisfied before a court may accept an assertion of the state secrets privilege.

[...] The Court noted that the privilege was absolute, even if the need in the plaintiff was compelling.
