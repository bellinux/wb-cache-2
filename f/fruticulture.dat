40|$|This {{paper is}} based on case studies done among 2008 - 2011, on rural labor in {{concentrated}} investments. Economic sectors studied were <b>fruticulture</b> in Rio Negro Upper Valley, forestry in Misiones NW, and transgenic corn seeds in Buenos Aires North. Methodology was multisited ethnography searching on different actors’ point of view. Techniques applied were in field deep interviews and participant observation. Secondary analysis by comparative method shown in this paper allows us to point out three continuity issues:Enterprises strategy to discern between “production and “services", reduces classic employment positions. The environmentalization of labor relationship happens by means of quality management and total quality proceedings. This relationship link work (understood as “well done job") with productivity growth. There are different territories one related with production, the other with work and workers dwelling...|$|E
40|$|The Moscamed Program began {{activities}} in 1997, {{as a consequence}} of detecting this plague, it is considered {{as one of the most}} devastating plague in the world of <b>fruticulture.</b> In the operation of this program we can distinguish two periods: first, it is characterized by the control and eradication of this plague in 1977 - 1982; second characterized by the presence of the program to control this plague in the Mexico-Guatemala’s boundary. The goal of this research was to describe the main characteristics of the Moscamed Program, its explaining variables as well as regional <b>fruticulture</b> implications. This type of research was historical-descriptive, selective key informers trough random survey was used, structure surveys were applied to 27 producers. In the period of study results showed that: there was a continuing presence of cases of this plague, finding between 1992 to 1995 many cases; a decreasing assignment of economical resources to the program activities, In the first period the program had an allocation of US 11. 86 million of dollars, in the second US 5. 25. Negative attitudes to the program were found in 26 % of the producers, 93. 3 % of producers said that they did not know the objective and profits of the program and 33 % of them do not know its activities. This explains why producers did not participate and did not show interest in the program. Items which could explain the staying of the program in the analyzed period are: the presence of the plague in Guatemala, the plantation production system in the area, the migration of workers from Guatemala coming from infested regions as well as the decreasing resources allocation. The low presence or not of the plague in the region has not effects in the land planted with fruit plants as well as there is not influence in fruit plants species comsuption. According to the results, we recommend to implement a campaign in order to know the objectives, activities and profits of this program, we recommend a campaign to eliminate this plague in Guatemala and Central America as well as to increase the program’s budget...|$|E
40|$|Lulo is {{a species}} of great {{importance}} to the <b>fruticulture</b> of Colombia, but has significant phytosanitary problems that require an aggressive breeding program oriented toward the production of genotypes with tolerance to phytopathogens. These programs need to establish highly efficient mass plant propagation protocols, such as somatic embryogenesis. This study focused on research on the somatic embryogenesis of lulo using kinetin, naphthalene acetic acid-NAA (Plant Growth Regulators, PGRs), and different sucrose concentrations in a MS medium. Two lulo varieties, Solanum quitoense var. septentrionale and S. quitoense var. quitoense, and two explant types (hypocotyl and cotyledon) were used, incubated in dark conditions at 25 ± 2 °C. The highest production percentage of the embryos was obtained when 50 muM of NAA {{were added to the}} medium with sucrose (50. 0 and 263. 1 muM) for the two explant types used. In lulo with spines, the highest percentage of embryonic structures (50 %) was observed with cotyledonary leaf explants and 50 muM of NAA; while in the spineless lulo, the embryonic structures were observed in the same type of explant with 50 muM of NAA + 263. 1 muM of sucrose (32 %) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the potential use of <b>fruticulture</b> waste as an additive in elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum) cultivar Napier silage at different densities, defining the effect of fermentative quality, microbiological characteristics and bromatological composition. The experimental design was completely randomized with four replications in a 4 x 3 factorial scheme, comprising a control, banana waste (BW), mango waste (MW), and passion fruit waste (PFW) at three densities (400, 500 and 600 kg green matter [GM] m- 3). The effect of ensiling density was greatest in the exclusively elephant grass silage, where a compaction of 600 kg GM m- 3 contributed to improvements in fermentation and microbiological processes. The addition of banana waste to the elephant grass silage promoted improvements only in bromatological composition, raising the dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), and non-fiber carbohydrate (NFC) content and reducing fiber components (neutral detergent fiber [NDFap] and acid detergent fiber [ADFap] corrected for ash and protein), but the addition of banana waste did not favor the fermentative or microbiological processes. The addition of passion fruit and mango by-products promoted increased DM and favored the fermentative, microbiological, and bromatological silage processes, regardless of density...|$|E
40|$|Pedotransfer {{functions}} (PTFs) are equations used {{to estimate}} soil characteristics difficult to determine from other easily obtained ones. Water retention in soil is used in several agronomic and environmental applications, but its direct determination is time consuming and onerous, therefore PTFs are alternatives to obtaining this information more quickly and economically. The aims {{of this study were}} to generate a database and develop PTFs for water retention at potentials of - 33 kPa (field capacity) and - 1500 kPa (permanent wilting point) for Yellow Argisol and Yellow Latosol from the Brazilian Coastal Plains region. The Coastal Plains soils are mostly developed from Barreiras formation (pre-weathered sediments) and their main uses are sugarcane, livestock, forestry and <b>fruticulture.</b> The database to generate the PTFs was composed from the selection of information derived from scientific works and soil survey reports of the region. Specific PTFs were generated for each soil class, in their respective A and B horizons and for solum, through multiple regression by stepwise package of R language programming. Due to the small pedological variability (small number of soil classes containing great geographical expression) and mineralogical uniformity, usually observed in this environment, non-stratification of soil classes to create general PTFs presented similar or superior results compared to equations for each soil class. The adjustment of data demonstrated that water retention values at - 33 kPa and - 1500 kPa potentials can be estimated with adequate accuracy for the main soils of the Brazilian Coastal Plains through PTFs mainly from particle size distribution and secondarily from organic matter data...|$|E
40|$|International {{competition}} and the pressing request of the consumers oblige italian <b>fruticulture</b> {{to be at the}} forefront of innovation. Thanks to the most recent advances on apple “omics” approaches, a wealth of in‐field experience, interaction with nutritionists and experts of human health, modern tools for apple orchard management and fruit conservation, six Italian institutions joined in 2010 to implement Italian apple cultivation: A) By developing fundamental technological genetic/genomics tools for apple breeding and technologies and tools for non‐invasive fruit quality assessment; B) by elucidating the main structure of the apple fruit metabolome and its relationship with standard fruit quality parameters to improve the knowledge about the molecular bases of fruit quality with emphasis on nutritional and health‐related properties. C) By applying the above powerful molecular genetics tools and knowledge to molecular breeding and to the production chain in order to 1) improve apple resistance to pathogens, 2) enhance fruit quality (mainly in terms of nutritional aspects), 3) reduce environmental impacts and increase sustainability, and 4) optimize the production chain. This proposal has therefore set the following specific objectives: 1. Production of genomic, transcriptomic and metabolomic tools and knowledge to lay the foundation of efficient marker‐assisted breeding for varietal innovation and better comprehension, in molecular terms, of the key quality traits of apple fruit. 2. Creation of genetic lines and selections aimed to improve fruit quality and disease resistance. 3. Improvement of the key steps of the pre‐harvest production phase, achieved by means of the following actions: ‐Development of new thinning strategies based on environment‐friendly chemicals and mechanical methods. ‐Development of new self‐thinning cultivars. ‐Water management improvement to control fruit quality. ‐Real time management of crop load. ‐Innovative measuring tools for monitoring the onset and evolution of fruit ripening. 4. Optimization of the production chain, its traceability, and fruit quality assessment, pursued by: ‐New methods to enhance fruit homogeneity. ‐Advanced traceability system. ‐Comparison between instrumental and sensorial fruit quality assessment. 5. Characterization of the key nutraceutical profile and allergenic properties of apple fruit by: A) Identification of bioactive molecules and analysis of their roles as modulators of risk factors for dismetabolic diseases and their anti‐neoplastic activity; B) Identification of the master determinants of apple allergenicity and search for hypoallergenic apple cultivar...|$|E
