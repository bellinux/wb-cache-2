500|$|At the University of Michigan, Kaczynski {{specialized}} in complex analysis, specifically geometric function theory. His intellect and drive impressed his professors. [...] "He {{was an unusual}} person. He was not like the other graduate students. He was much more focused about his work. He had a drive to discover mathematical truth," [...] said professor Peter Duren. [...] "It {{is not enough to}} say he was smart," [...] said George Piranian, another of his Michigan math professors. During his time at Michigan, Kaczynski earned 5 B's and 12 A's in his 18 courses. However in 2006, he said his [...] "memories of the University of Michigan are NOT pleasant... the fact that I not only passed my courses (except one physics course) but <b>got</b> <b>quite</b> a few A's, shows how wretchedly low the standards were at Michigan." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the same}} interview, Sapochnik was also asked {{about how he}} went about {{creating}} a sense of emotion in the 'King in the North' scene, saying [...] "It wasn't hard. I think as fans we'd been waiting for it for so long. That said, {{it was a very}} difficult scene to shoot. Mainly because it was unusually hot over the two days we shot it, everyone was wearing heavy furs and armor, Kit was actually pretty ill and everyone was crammed into this space full of plates of sheep's tongues and chicken carcasses so it <b>got</b> <b>quite</b> smelly and sticky. It's also quite a long scene and yet Bella did it probably more than a hundred times, only forgetting a line once in the entire time. When we finished the scene she got a standing ovation from all the cast and crew." ...|$|E

500|$|LeMond {{broke his}} {{collarbone}} on April 11, 1982, while racing the cycling classic Liège–Bastogne–Liège. The injury forced LeMond {{to ride a}} reduced schedule before entering the World Championships, which were in Goodwood, England that year. In the men's road race competition LeMond broke for the line but was out-sprinted by Italian Giuseppe Saronni. Following the race LeMond's American teammate Jacques Boyer accused LeMond of chasing him down in the final 800 meters. Saronni was very strong {{at the end of}} the race and flew past Boyer and LeMond, winning by 5 seconds over LeMond, with another 5 seconds back to Kelly. Boyer placed tenth. Bronze medalist Sean Kelly, a favorite to win the race, was with Saronni when he caught LeMond with about 200 meters to go, but he could not hold his wheel. Said Kelly: [...] "I don't think that Boyer was fading...He <b>got</b> <b>quite</b> a good gap. Nobody wanted to go after him...Yes, LeMond chased down Boyer. Boyer was the only man up the road." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{began work}} on her first novel, An Ordinary Lunacy, {{relatively}} late in life: she started writing in her late thirties, and it was published only in 1963, by which time she was aged 47. Although it began life as a radio play, Anderson quickly found that An Ordinary Lunacy was [...] "interesting enough for a novel, so I went off, and it <b>got</b> <b>quite</b> out of hand." [...] The novel detailed the romance between thirty-five-year-old Sydney barrister, David Byfield, and Isobel Purdy, a woman accused of murdering her husband. Acclaimed for its adept portrayal of the protean nature of romantic love, An Ordinary Lunacy foregrounds the different perspectives of three women: Isobel, Daisy Byfield (David's mother), and Myra Magaskill, David's ex-lover. Pam Gilbert writes that [...] "Anderson's construction of the tensions existing between three women such as Daisy, Isobel and Myra offers an interesting platform for an exposition of romance and passion from a woman's perspective." ...|$|E
500|$|Actor James Anderson {{was cast}} as Oliver. Before {{assuming}} the role, he shadowed a real F1 doctor on ward rounds – an experience he found difficult. [...] "We were approaching beds {{in which people}} were waking up from heart attacks and coming around quite distressed sometimes. It was really difficult {{to be there with}} a patient. It's harder than you think and I <b>got</b> <b>quite</b> emotional." [...] Anderson underwent such extensive training with the programme's medical advisors that he jested in June2009, [...] "If I started medical training now, I could probably graduate as a doctor coming out of the show!" [...] The actor experienced [...] "an extended period of anxiety" [...] upon joining the series, and recalls: [...] "It took me about six months to have any sense {{of what was going on}} and then the second six months to feel comfortable [...] but only because it's such a well-oiled machine. You're coming in as a little cog, so you have to discover how to work in that and that takes a while." ...|$|E

500|$|It was in Socha Na Tha (2004) that Kukunoor noticed Ayesha Takia {{and until}} then he assumed {{her to be}} a glamor doll. After getting {{convinced}} about her acting skills, she was roped in for the character of Meera. Takia said that though her character emotionally drained her, it was not tough to portray and that she could learn a lot about life. She further said that, [...] "Dor was indeed an exciting challenge for the actor in me. I am happy that it was also a very exciting role, which not many actors get to portray at such a young age." [...] She said that with Dor, she was not only in the film industry for glamor, but also for her acting prowess. While filming, Kukunoor bonded so well with Takia that he requested her to be his sister. Since she did not have a brother in real life, she <b>got</b> <b>quite</b> emotional with Kukunoor's brotherly proposal. This affection eventually solemnized {{in the form of a}} rakhi symbolically.|$|E

Prior to Jones' casting, Alice Eve was the subject of what Variety called [...] "widespread Internet reports" [...] that Eve [...] "was set to play Emma Frost, although no deal was in place." [...] Jones accepted the role to get something different from her job in the TV series Mad Men. While discovering that like the show First Class was set in the 1960s, the actress considered that: [...] "'s so, so far from Betty and from Mad Men, and it takes place in that time but it doesn’t feel like a period movie." [...] The actress described the revealing costumes of the character as [...] "insane," [...] saying, [...] "She's <b>got</b> <b>quite</b> the bod, which is very intimidating". The actress stated that she did only a limited exercise routine to keep in shape, as [...] "I'm a petite person, so I didn't want to go into a strict workout and eating regime." ...|$|E
500|$|In a May 7, 1918 {{letter from}} Tobolsk {{to her sister}} Maria in Yekaterinburg, Anastasia {{described}} a moment of joy despite her sadness and loneliness and worry for the sick Alexei: [...] "We played on the swing, that was when I roared with laughter, the fall was so wonderful! Indeed! I told the sisters about {{it so many times}} yesterday that they <b>got</b> <b>quite</b> fed up, but I could go on telling it masses of times... What weather we've had! One could simply shout with joy." [...] In his memoirs, one of the guards at the Ipatiev House, Alexander Strekotin, remembered Anastasia as [...] "very friendly and full of fun", while another guard said Anastasia was [...] "a very charming devil! She was mischievous and, I think, rarely tired. She was lively, and was fond of performing comic mimes with the dogs, as though they were performing in a circus." [...] Yet another of the guards, however, called the youngest grand duchess [...] "offensive and a terrorist" [...] and complained that her occasionally provocative comments sometimes caused tension in the ranks. Anastasia and her sisters helped their maid darn stockings and assisted the cook in making bread and other kitchen chores while they were in captivity at the Ipatiev House.|$|E

500|$|Edler {{was largely}} unknown during his NHL Draft year, unranked by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau the entire season. He {{was brought to}} the {{attention}} of the Vancouver Canucks by the team's head scout in Sweden, Thomas Gradin, who saw Edler playing with Jämtlands HF. Although Gradin would refer to the team's level of play as little more than beer-league-calibre, he was impressed with Edler and encouraged Canucks management to draft him (Edler's number 23 with the Canucks would later be chosen by team trainers in honour of Gradin). The Canucks traded up in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft to acquire the Dallas Stars' third-round draft pick in exchange for their own third-round pick in the 2005 Draft, and used the pick to select Edler 91st overall. The deal was made with the Stars in lieu of speculation that the Detroit Red Wings had a high interest in Edler and wanted to draft him in the third round as well. Detroit had discovered Edler in Sweden through their European scout Håkan Andersson, who was responsible for such previous Red Wings late-round picks as Henrik Zetterberg and Pavel Datsyuk. At the time of his draft, Canucks General Manager Dave Nonis described Edler as a [...] "smooth skater [...] big guy." [...] Nonis added that, [...] "He needs some time , but in terms of raw skill, he's <b>got</b> <b>quite</b> a bit of it." ...|$|E

He was directed by Mike Reiss, and his father Ken Griffey, Sr. was also present, trying to coach his son. Roger Clemens, who made his own chicken noises, was directed by Jeff Martin, as was Wade Boggs. Mike Reiss directed {{most of the other}} players. Mike Scioscia accepted his guest spot in [...] "half a second," [...] while Ozzie Smith has stated {{that he would like to}} guest star again [...] "so [...] can get out [...]" [...] Don Mattingly, who was forced to shave off his [...] "sideburns" [...] by Mr. Burns during the episode, would later have an actual [...] "haircut controversy", while he was playing for the New York Yankees. The coaching staff forced him to cut his long hair, and was briefly dropped from the team line-up for not doing so. Many people believed the joke in the episode to be a reference to the incident, but [...] "Homer at the Bat" [...] was recorded a year before it happened.
