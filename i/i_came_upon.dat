25|$|We {{left the}} town, fleeing this living picture of Sodom, with incessant fear lest the raging {{waters of the}} lake {{overtake}} us, which were at the moment invading {{the main part of}} the town, sweeping away everything they encountered. On the outskirts of the town, <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>upon</b> a woman who was so exhausted by her burden of two little children and a bundle of clothing that she could proceed no farther. Moved by pity, I took one of the toddlers from her and carried him, and the little indio who has been wailing while in the arms of his mother, stopped short when I took him into mine and never uttered a sound while I was carrying him a good piece of the way.|$|E
500|$|Edward said of {{the fort}} that [...] "By the time <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>upon</b> it, {{it had become a}} pseudo-Gothic hodge-podge. A profusion of yew trees kept one side of the house in {{perpetual}} shadow, staining the wall with green acidulous mould. But the half-buried beauty of the place leaped to my eye." ...|$|E
2500|$|Richthofen {{took the}} {{flamboyant}} step of having his Albatros painted red {{when he became}} a squadron commander. His autobiography states, [...] "For whatever reasons, one fine day <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>upon</b> the idea of having my crate painted glaring red. The result was that absolutely everyone could not help but notice my red bird. In fact, my opponents also seemed to be not entirely unaware [...] ". Thereafter he usually flew in red-painted aircraft, although not all of them were entirely red, nor was the [...] "red" [...] necessarily the brilliant scarlet beloved of model- and replica-builders.|$|E

6000|$|... ‘O let me lie!’ he pleaded. ‘I’ll no’ {{get better}} anyway.’ And then, with a moan {{that went to}} my heart, ‘O why did <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>upon</b> this miserable journey?’ ...|$|R
6000|$|Now, had <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>upon</b> {{a hopeless}} incompatibility? Was this the reductio ad absurdum of my vision, and must it even as I sat there fade, dissolve, and vanish before my eyes? ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{intention}} was to give Murphy's character Marcus Graham a cool, yet sophisticated style. [...] "So typically {{when it comes to}} black characters, either {{you have to be a}} successful, smart business person, or you're hip, but you're never both," [...] said Hudlin. [...] "And one of the reasons why the movie has had such enduring popularity is because the character is both. He's much more in the Cary Grant mode of business person." [...] While working on the characterization of the main character, Hudlin came up with the foot gag, which was used as a plot device to show the arc of the character's growth. It originated from a joke between the director and his friends about a man who's so picky about women that he even looks at their back teeth. [...] "So it's like, how do we define that Eddie's a back teeth kind of guy? So <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>upon</b> the idea of showing feet. That no matter how beautiful this woman is, if she has messed up feet, he's out of there." [...] Also, Hudlin said that [...] "we know he's evolved into a higher level of consciousness when he doesn't even notice what Halle Berry's feet look like." [...] The character Angela's art class was an idea the filmmakers had to put Murphy in a context where he could interact with kids, which he hadn't done prior to this film.|$|E
2500|$|... "The days soon arrived when, on forced marches {{after the}} enemy, all {{discharges}} of firearms {{except at the}} enemy were strictly prohibited under severe penalty. [...] Being out on the right flank one day, just {{out of sight of}} the troops, <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>upon</b> a beautiful covey of grouse. [...] They were so tame I could almost knock them over with rocks, but while the contact thus established made me increasingly anxious for grouse for dinner that night, I could not hit them. [...] So finally, in spite of those orders and with growing appetite, I shot two of them and quickly secreted the evidence of my disobedience by rolling them up in the rain coat I carried on my saddle. [...] The right wing of the command was wildly excited by the shots. [...] The skirmishers thrown out on that side soon discovered my lonely presence and hustled me to Colonel Chambers with the news that no Indians were visible. [...] He very sternly asked. [...] ‘Mr. Strahorn, did you do that firing?" [...] Upon my answering, [...] "Yes sir," [...] he still more gruffly asked, [...] "At Indians, or what?" [...] "Not at Indians, Colonel, but at grouse," [...] I answered. [...] "I was so hungry for grouse that I just couldn’t help it, so I’m ready to pay the penalty. [...] What is it?’ [...] Be it remembered that I was in the Colonel’s mess, and he replied quietly on the side, ‘Well, it will make a damn sight of difference whether you got a grouse.’" ...|$|E
60|$|Once, {{under the}} weather cloth, <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>upon</b> him talking to himself. It was more a prayer.|$|E
6000|$|... "And when <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>upon</b> it, <b>I</b> shall {{find that}} I have bought a {{crumbling}} pile of ruined masonry, unfit to house {{a family of}} foxes," [...] replied the old woman peevishly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I will {{remember}} that, mynheer, and {{will act as}} promptly as may be; but the malefactors have twenty-four hours start of me. I may have to journey far ere <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>upon</b> their track." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O let me lie!" [...] he pleaded. [...] "I'll no' {{get better}} anyway." [...] And {{then with a}} moan that went to my heart, [...] "O why did <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>upon</b> this miserable journey?" ...|$|R
60|$|I said it {{certainly}} was not business that <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>upon,</b> {{but it was not}} quite a pleasant matter.|$|E
60|$|It was {{not until}} our work was nearly done that <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>upon</b> my father and he {{received}} me as if expecting I would come.|$|E
6000|$|Returning up the platform, <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>upon</b> Sylvie alone. [...] "Well, child," [...] I said, [...] "where's {{your little}} news-boy? Couldn't he get you an evening-paper?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, then, you've got {{a sort of}} a {{relation}} of mine here, ma'am,' said the traveller; 'a young man of the name of Tapley. What! Mark, my boy!' apostrophizing the premises, 'have <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>upon</b> you at last, old buck!' ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{have not}} {{described}} her clothes. ‘That’s a mistake,’ says my mother. ‘When <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>upon</b> {{a woman in}} a book, the first thing I want to know about her is whether she was good-looking, and the second, how she was put on.’ ...|$|R

60|$|Outside of the ladies' tent <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>upon</b> Miss Thorn, stowing a large basket. I {{told her}} that we had taken that {{precaution}} the night before.|$|E
6000|$|On my road home <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>upon</b> Satan, and reproached {{him with}} deceiving {{me with that}} lie. He was not embarrassed, but said, quite simply and composedly: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hardly your liege subjects, Your Majesty, if I may {{venture to}} say so; for, assuredly, {{they were not}} engaged in lawful proceedings, when <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>upon</b> them." ...|$|E
60|$|But <b>I</b> <b>came</b> {{yesterday}} <b>upon</b> a {{yet more}} crude and startling example.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; the {{zest for}} nearly {{everything}} goes. I don't {{care so much}} for Tourguenief as I used.

60|$|One day in {{returning}} from this spring by a circuitous path, <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>upon</b> a scene which {{reminded me of}} Stonehenge and the architectural labours of the Druid.|$|E
60|$|I promised, and escaped. On {{the veranda}} <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>upon</b> Miss Thorn {{surrounded}} {{by some of}} her uncle's guests. I imagine that she was bored, for she looked it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'BEEN to the Study, my dear!' she {{returned}} emphatically. 'Indeed I have! <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>upon</b> the amiable creature--if you'll imagine my feelings, Miss Trotwood and David--in {{the act of}} making his will.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Russ, I feel {{as though}} I couldn't. I can't make head or tail of life out here. My father seems so strange. Though, of course, I've only seen him twice a year since I was a little girl. He has two sides to him. When <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>upon</b> that strange side, the one I never knew, he's like a man I never saw.|$|R
60|$|NOT as yet {{directly}} {{aiming at}} how it <b>came</b> to pass, <b>I</b> will <b>come</b> <b>upon</b> it by degrees. The natural manner, after all, for God knows {{that is how}} it <b>came</b> <b>upon</b> me.|$|R
6000|$|... "To get any, daddy, I {{may have}} to go way back to the wagon, for <b>I</b> haven't <b>come</b> <b>upon</b> a single {{watercourse}} since leaving camp this morning." ...|$|R
60|$|I rose, {{opened the}} door, and {{slipped out of}} it, and I must have made a strange, hatless figure as <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>upon</b> the fiddler and his {{children}} from across the street.|$|E
60|$|At length, upon {{emerging}} from Butchers' Row, <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>upon</b> some stocks {{standing in the}} street, and beheld ahead of me a great gateway stretching across the Strand from house to house.|$|E
6000|$|A {{few days}} ago during a pause {{in one of my}} college lectures (my class being asleep) I sat reading Draper's [...] "Intellectual Development of Europe". Quite {{suddenly}} <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>upon</b> the following sentence: ...|$|E
6000|$|Turning {{over that}} leaf, <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>upon</b> some half-effaced {{miscellaneous}} memoranda in pencil, {{characteristic of a}} methodical mind, and therefore indubitably my father's, which he must have made at various times during his stay in Liverpool. These are full of a strange, subdued, old, midsummer interest to me: and though, from the numerous effacements, it is much like cross-reading to make them out; yet, I must here copy a few at random:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We {{are very}} {{pleasant}} here; so very pleasant, Dennis, that but for my lord's particular desire that I should sup with him, {{and the time}} being very near at hand, I should be inclined to stay, until it would be hardly safe to go homeward. <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>upon</b> a little business--yes, I do--as you supposed.
