40|$|Changes of cell {{morphology}} {{and the state}} of differentiation are known to play important roles in embryogenesis as well as in carcinogenesis. Examples of particularly profound changes are the conversions of epithelial to mesenchymal cells; i. e., the dissociation of some or all polygonal, polar epithelial cells and their transformation into elongate, fibroblastoid cells of high motility. As an in vitro model system for such changes in {{cell morphology}}, we have used cell cultures of the rat bladder carcinoma-derived cell line NBT-II which, on exposure to <b>inducing</b> <b>medium</b> containing a commercial serum substitute (Ultroser G), show an extensive change in their organization (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) : the junctions between the epithelial cells are split, the epithelial cell organization is lost, and the resulting individual cells become motile and assume a spindle- like fibroblastoid appearance. Using immunofluorescence microscopy and biochemical protein characterization techniques, we show that this change is accompanied by a redistribution of desmosomal plaque proteins (desmoplakins, desmoglein, plakoglobin) and by a reorganization of the cytokeratin and the actin-fodrin filament systems. Moreover, intermediate-sized filaments of the vimentin type are formed in the fibroblastoid cells. We demonstrate that the modulation of desmosomal proteins, specifically an increase in soluble desmoplakins, is a relatively early event in cell dissociation and in epithelial- mesenchymal transition. In this process, a latent period of 5 h upon addition of <b>inducing</b> <b>medium</b> precedes the removal of these desmosomal components from the plasma membrane. The transition, which is reversible, is dependent on continued protein synthesis and phosphorylation but not on the presence of the <b>inducing</b> <b>medium</b> beyond the initial 2 -h period. We discuss the value of this experimental system as a physiologically relevant approach for studying the regulation of the assembly and disassembly of desmosomes and other intercellular adhesion structures, and as a model of the conversion of cells from one state of differentiation into another...|$|R

Medium effects in highly aqueous solutions ([H 2 O] > 50 M) of ethanol, 1 -propanol, 2 -propanol, 1 -butanol and 2 -methyl- 2 -propanol have also been determined.

40|$|An {{adventitious}} shoot regeneration {{system was}} developed for Populus deltoides Bartr. ex Marsh. using internodal stem explants. Both the genotype of the explant tissue and the type and concentration of cytokinin used for shoot regeneration significantly influenced the regeneration response. The cytokinin zeatin consistently stimulated regeneration of {{the greatest number of}} shoots compared to 2 -isopentyladenine and 6 -benzyladenine. Six of 16 genotypes were highly recalcitrant and failed to regenerate shoots. ^ Stabilized shoot cultures were established from adventitious shoots of four genotypes and were maintained for over one year. The shoot cultures were used to determine the effect of zeatin concentration and genotype on axillary shoot production and growth. Genotypic differences were significant for axillary shoot production and growth. Zeatin concentration also significantly affected shoot production and growth with 1. 0 mgL- 1 zeatin stimulating the greatest number of shoots while growth was best at 0. 25 mgL- 1 zeatin. ^ The in vitro developmental stage of shoot regeneration competence was determined for 15 genotypes. Two genotypes were highly competent and regenerated the greatest number of shoots when cultured directly onto shoot <b>inducing</b> <b>medium.</b> Competence was stimulated in seven genotypes as determined by a significant increase in shoot regeneration when explants were cultured for eight days or less on callus <b>inducing</b> <b>medium</b> before transfer to shoot <b>inducing</b> <b>medium.</b> Six genotypes were found to be recalcitrant and competence could not be induced. The ability to manipulate the competence response by stock plant hedging was demonstrated. ^ Protein differences associated with competence and shoot regeneration were studied for one genotype. Two proteins (51 kD and 26 kD) were associated with the acquisition of shoot regeneration competence. Three proteins (34 kD, 31 kD and 25. 5 kD) were associated with callus determination. A 31. 5 kD protein was found to be associated with shoot organogenesis while a 35 kD protein was associated with callus proliferation. ...|$|R

40|$|Jet {{quenching}} {{in heavy}} ion collisions {{is expected to}} be accompanied by recoil effects, but unambiguous signals for the <b>induced</b> <b>medium</b> response have been difficult to identify so far. Here, we argue that modern jet substructure measurements can improve this situation qualitatively since they are sensitive to the momentum distribution inside the jet. We show that the groomed subjet shared momentum fraction z_g, and the girth of leading and subleading subjets signal recoil effects with dependencies that are absent in a recoilless baseline. We find that recoil effects can explain most of the medium modifications to the z_g distribution observed in data. Furthermore, for jets passing the Soft Drop Condition, recoil effects induce in the differential distribution of subjet separation Δ R_ 12 a characteristic increase with Δ R_ 12, and they introduce a characteristic enhancement of the girth of the subleading subjet with decreasing z_g. We explain why these qualitatively novel features, that we establish in Jewel+Pythia simulations, reflect generic physical properties of recoil effects that should therefore be searched for as telltale signatures of jet-induced medium response.

40|$|Systemin-mediated defense {{signaling}} in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) {{plants is}} analogous to the cytokine-mediated inflammatory response in animals. Herein, we report that the initiation of defense signaling in suspension-cultured cells of Lycopersicon peruvianum by the peptide systemin, as well as by chitosan and β-glucan elicitor from Phytophtora megasperma, is inhibited by the polysulfonated naphtylurea compound suramin, a known inhibitor of cytokine and growth factor receptor interactions in animal cells. Using a radioreceptor assay, we show that suramin interfered with the binding of the systemin analog 125 I-Tyr- 2,Ala- 15 -systemin to the systemin receptor with an IC 50 of 160 μM. Additionally, labeling of the systemin receptor with a photoaffinity analog of systemin was inhibited in the presence of suramin. Receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of a 48 -kDa mitogen-activated protein kinase and alkalinization of the medium of suspension-cultured cells in response to systemin and carbohydrate elicitors were also inhibited by suramin. The inhibition of medium alkalinization by suramin was reversible in the presence of high concentrations of systemin and carbohydrate elicitors. Calyculin A and erythrosin B, intracellular inhibitors of phosphatases and plasma membrane proton ATPases, respectively, both induce medium alkalinization, but neither response was inhibited by suramin. The polysulfonated compound heparin did not inhibit systemin-induced medium alkalinization.

40|$|The main {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} is the understanding of how microtubers are formed out of auxiliary buds in induced conditions. In the induced buds, meristematical cells with high cytoplasmic and nuclear stain ability expand deeper into the inner sections of the buds, comparing with non-induced buds, which the area is restricted to the apical regions. The first sign of microtuberization is the increase in size of cortical parenchyma cells in lower section and also increase in mitosis divisions in inner sections of the meristems. Most of the growth rates occur in the <b>induced</b> <b>medium</b> along the length and {{the width of the}} cells. It is also considered that the diametric growth of the tubers and the base of the leaves on the tubers begin their radial growth. The cortical parenchyma cells begin forming amidon grains during their vacuolar extension at extending the internodes much earlier than pith parenchyma cells. The extension of cells in sub-apical region {{plays an important role in}} the longitudinal growth of tubers. In the first stages, the growth of tubers results from the change in the dimensions of cortical and pith parenchyma cells, due to the reproduction of apical meristem and later, mainly from the growth of the productive tissue in the pith parenchyma. Longitudinal growth is initially grater than the growth in diameter; however with shift in the position of vacuoles and their arrangement across rather than along the tubers, the growth pattern begins to change and lateral growth catches on and exceeds longitudinal growth. In fully grown tubers, pith parenchyma cells are larger than the cells in cortical parenchyma...|$|E

40|$|Caulogenesis and rhizogenesis {{were studied}} in cultured explants of Begonia erythrophylla. The {{patterns}} of development {{were compared to}} each other and to explants cultured on non-organogenic media. Initially morphological and histological observations were carried out using both light and scanning electron microscopy. Shoots and roots were formed from cells of epidermal origin and were often associated with glandular hairs. Deposition of starch was correlated to organogenesis, with starch grains localized in the superficial layers of the explant, prior to the formation of meristematic regions. Once formed, meristematic regions showed high levels of enzymatic activity compared to the surrounding tissues. Media transfer experiments were conducted between root <b>inducing</b> <b>medium</b> (RIM) and shoot <b>inducing</b> <b>medium</b> (SIM), shoot <b>inducing</b> <b>medium</b> and a basal medium containing no growth regulators (BM), and RIM and BM. It was found that explants became determined for shoot production after 7 days, while they were determined for root production after 3 days on RIM before transfer to BM. Explants were found to be weakly canalized for rhizogenesis for the first 2 days after determination, thereafter they became strongly canalized. Explants were strongly canalized for caulogenesis once determined. Culture on BM prior to exposure to an organogenic medium resulted in the gradual loss of competence with time, but exposure for 2 days to either SIM or RIM resulted in explants becoming competent to respond to opposite inductive medium. Using one and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, both unlabelled protein and protein labelled in vivo with [35 S]-methionine were extracted from organogenic and non-organogenic explants. Silver-stained gels and fluorographs were analyzed to identify different sets of polypeptides associated with development in vitro. Overall the levels of 59 silver-stained and 29 labelled polypeptides were altered. It was shown that rhizogenesis and caulogenesis in petiole sections of B. erythrophylla are associated with both quantitative and qualitative changes in the expression of polypeptides. Most of these changes occur at, or after, the point of organ determination. Some of those associated with caulogenesis were also observed when leaf discs were cultured on SIM. Tissues of mature plants were examined for the presence of these polypeptides. The process of caulogenesis in petiole explants can be further divided by the use of chemical inhibitors of shoot formation. Additions of sorbitol, ribose, acetylsalicylic acid or tri-iodobenzoic acid to SIM, respectively, inhibits shoot formation without killing the explants. These inhibitors are only effective if explants are exposed prior to certain stages of development, after which they fail to inhibit shoot formation. The effects of these inhibitors on the pattern polypeptide changes associated with culture on SIM was determined...|$|R

Secondary bone healing requires strong internal fixation, intramedullary pressure reduction and early functional exercise. Objective: To compare bone healing of femoral neck fractures treated with hollow-bone-graft dynamic hip screws (Hb-DHS) and standard dynamic hip screws (DHS) in an animal model. Design: Testing of specifically designed fixation devices in a pig animal model. Interventions/Methods: We designed Hb-DHS and DHS devices {{appropriate to the}} femoral neck and head of experimental animals and used them in eight pigs (4 -month-old, male or female, 30 - 40 kg/each). Under anesthesia, we <b>induced</b> <b>medium</b> neck type, Garden III type femoral neck fractures in each pig with fracture gaps of 0. 5 mm and then fixed each left femur with Hb-DHS and each right femur with DHS. We assessed the animals radiographically and by postmortem visual appraisal of evidence of bone healing 8 and 16 weeks postoperatively. Results: There were significant differences in radiographic and general findings between the Hb-DHS and DHS groups at weeks 8 and 16 postoperatively. We found {{statistically significant differences between}} the Hb-DHS and DHS groups in bone healing scores, trabecular bone volume percentage and bone mineral density as assessed on plain radiographs and computed tomography images (P < 0. 05). There were also significant differences between the Hb-DHS and DHS groups in postmortem visually assessed indicators of bone healing at both 8 and 16 weeks postoperatively. Conclusions: The Hb-DHS device promotes femoral neck bone union, stimulates trabecular bone formation, increases BMD and has advantages over DHS for internal fixation of femoral neck fractures. This animal experiment will contribute to developing optimal treatment for femoral neck fractures in young adults...|$|E

This is of particular benefit to the NASA Laser Atmospheric Wind Sounder (LAWS) project. A benefit of the completed code is that although developed specifically for the pulsed CO 2 laser much of the code can be modified to model other laser systems of interest to the lidar community. A Boltzmann equation solver has been developed which enables the electron excitation rates for the vibrational levels of CO 2 and N 2, together with the electron ionization and attachment coefficients to be determined for any CO 2 laser gas mixture consisting of a combination of CO 2, N 2, CO, He and CO.

In order to investigate the role of distinct environmental cues associated with {{the effect of the}} agonist during exposure to the primer, rats bearing 15 -day-old unilateral 6 -OHDA lesions were primed in their home cage with L-dopa or with saline. L-Dopa but not saline <b>induced</b> <b>medium</b> to low but steady contralateral turning. Three days later, challenge with the D 1 agonist SKF 38393 in the home cage also resulted in contralateral turning in the rats previously primed with L-dopa, but not in those primed with saline. In a second experiment rats lesioned with 6 -OHDA were primed in two different contexts (hemispheres versus cylinders) with a single administration of the D 2 /D 3 agonist quinpirole (LY 171555 : 0. 2 mg/kg s. c.) or saline. Three days later the rats were placed in hemispheres and tested for contraversive turning in response to saline or to SKF 38393. SKF 38393 elicited high rate contraversive turning independently of the environment where priming with quinpirole took place; on the other hand no conditioned contraversive turning was observed after saline. In a third experiment, the possibility of priming SKF 38393 -induced turning by stimulation of nigral or striatal DA receptors was investigated. Rats lesioned unilaterally with 6 -OHDA were locally infused on the lesioned side in the substantia nigra with SKF 38393 or in the striatum with quinpirole. Both these treatments elicited contralateral turning, the intranigral injection of SKF 38393 eliciting a stronger and longer lasting contraversive turning than intrastriatal quinpirole. Challenge with SKF 38393 (3 mg/kg s. c.) 3 days later induced contralateral turning only in rats previously primed with intrastriatal quinpirole. The results of these studies are consistent with the idea that ''priming'' is an example of non-associative sensitization induced by stimulation of denervated striatal DA receptors and expressed as an increased efficiency of post-synaptic dopaminergic transduction in the striatum...|$|E

These binary mixtures are structured on two distinct length scales: one associated with the self-assembled n-alkanol aggregates {{and the other with}} the underlying liquid nanostructure. This suggests that EA(+) and PA(+) enable n-alkanol aggregation by acting as cosurfactants, which EtA(+) cannot do because its terminating hydroxyl renders the cation nonamphiphilic. The primary determining factor for miscibility and self-assembly is the ratio of alkyl chain lengths of the alkanol and PIL cation, modulated by the anion type. These results show how ILs can support the self-assembly of nontraditional amphiphiles and enable the creation of new forms of soft matter...|$|R
30|$|To {{investigate}} {{the extent of}} L-malic acid conversion of the wild-type and the recombinant L. plantarum strain, both strains were incubated in a solution containing L-malic acid {{as well as in}} a modified white wine. Since the results shown above indicated that the initial pH affects the expression, cells were grown and <b>induced</b> in <b>medium</b> at pH 6.0 before the malic acid conversion experiments were conducted.|$|R

The validity of this effective theory is verified by the close agreement between the theoretical results and the experimental data...|$|R
40|$|A nano-layer {{of silicon}} oxide mask with {{inducing}} windows was prepared on a-Si. The inducing windows pre-defined the crystalline nucleation positions. The morphology of the resulted MMIC poly-Si {{depends on the}} width of the inducing windows, the thickness of silicon oxide outside the inducing windows, and the area density of the nickel <b>inducing</b> <b>medium.</b> Poly-Si composed of continuous zonal domain (CZD) in the same width was obtained under optimal conditions. In this case, metal induced nucleation took place in some isolated sites inside the inducing windows, the crystallization of a-Si proceeded around those isolated nuclei along radial direction inside the inducing windows, and then along radial or lateral direction outside the inducing windows. P-channel CZD poly-Si TFTs exhibited a field effect mobility (μ FE) of ∼ 65 cm 2 /V•s, a subthreshold swing (S) of 0. 56 V/dec, a threshold voltage (Vth) of - 3. 5 V, and a ratio of on-state to off-state drain currents of 2. 6 × 10 7. © 2010 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

40|$|Nitrate reductase {{utilizing}} NADH {{or reduced}} flavin mononucleotide (FMNH 2) as electron donor was {{extracted from the}} leaves, stems and petioles, and roots of apple seedlings. Successful extraction {{was made possible by}} the use of insoluble polyvinylpyrrolidone (Polyclar AT) which forms insoluble complexes with polyphenols and tannins. The level of nitrate reductase per gram fresh weight was highest in the leaf tissue although the nitrate content of the roots was much higher than that of the leaves. Nitrite reductase activity was detected only in leaf extracts and was 4 times higher than nitrate reductase activity. Nitrate was found in all parts of young apple trees and trace amounts were also detected in mature leaves from mature trees. Nitrate reductase was induced in young leaves of apple seedlings and in mature leaves from 3 fruit-bearing varieties. An inhibitor of polyphenoloxidase, 2 -mercaptobenzothiazole was used in both the <b>inducing</b> <b>medium</b> and the extracting medium in concentrations from 10 − 3 to 10 − 5 m with no effect upon nitrate reductase activity...|$|R
40|$|Seeds {{of three}} indica rice {{varieties}} B- 370, B- 2000 and Super basmati were sterilized and incubated on callus <b>inducing</b> <b>medium</b> (MS-Medium with 2 mgl - 1 2, 4 -D) for 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks and calli were obtained after somatic embryogenesis. After the incubation periods, calli {{were transferred to}} the regeneration medium. Regeneration efficiencies decreased from 98. 5, 98 and 95 % after two weeks incubation to 30, 34 and 24 % after eight weeks incubation for B- 370, Super basmati and B- 2000 respectively. Some interesting patterns for adventitious root formation were also observed. Significant variation was observed within and among different cultivars and incubation periods for average number of tillers, average plant height, number of panicles per plant, panicle length and average yield per plant. Seven interesting somaclones were marked and scored for agronomic and physiochemical analysis. Physiochemical studies did not reveal any significant variation. Present studies clearly indicated that somaclonal variation can successfully be used for creating genetic variation for varietal improvement...|$|R
