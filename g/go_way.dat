500|$|After Warner Bros. {{abandoned}} Lucas's early {{version of}} Apocalypse Now (1979) (during the post-production of THX 1138), the filmmaker decided to continue developing Another Quiet Night in Modesto, eventually changing its title to American Graffiti. To co-write a fifteen-page film treatment, Lucas hired Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz, who also added semi-autobiographical material to the story. [...] Lucas and producer Gary Kurtz began pitching the American Graffiti treatment to various Hollywood studios and production companies {{in an attempt to}} secure the financing needed to expand it into a screenplay, but they were unsuccessful. The potential financiers were concerned that music licensing costs would cause the film to <b>go</b> <b>way</b> over budget. Along with [...] Easy Rider (1969), American Graffiti {{was one of the first}} films to eschew a traditional film score and successfully rely instead on synchronizing a series of popular hit songs with individual scenes.|$|E
500|$|Lady Gaga {{collaborated with}} RedOne and Space Cowboy {{in writing and}} {{producing}} [...] "So Happy I Could Die". All {{three of them were}} the main instrumentalists behind the song and recorded it at Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles. Other personnel who worked on the song includes Johny Severin for vocal editing and audio engineering, Dave Russell for audio engineering and Mike Orton for mixing the song at Sarm West Studios. An occasional drinker, the song represents Gaga's fear of what she describes as the [...] "Alcohol Monster", as evident of several lyrics in the song, such as the chorus; [...] "Happy in the club with a bottle of red wine, stars in our eyes and we're having a good time." [...] In an interview with MTV, Gaga professed that the song is about the euphoric effects of alcohol—the so-called [...] "happy place"—and explained that her fear is split between two songs. [...] "My fear of alcohol. My fear of drugs... fear of addiction. [...] But alcohol is funny because it takes you down to this very happy place and just like forgetting all your problems and for just a minute you're so happy, {{and then all of a}} sudden, [...] stomach turns and <b>go</b> <b>way</b> down... And that's my relationship with consumption and abuse." [...] Other meaning behind the song was given by a writer for Elle magazine, which described it as [...] "about masturbating while thinking about a woman". The singer also acknowledged on her Twitter account that while writing the song she was inspired by English singer Lily Allen.|$|E

So, if you consider it all as beginning with that aid and from that moment, yes- we were the ones to start it.” ...|$|E

[...] Seminal American jazz poet Gil Scott-Heron was hired to perform the voice who says the slogan at the end because of [...] "his deep, charismatic voice;" [...] Scott-Heron {{was the first person to}} see the final advert, and, much to the relief of a fearful Robinson, he loved it.|$|E
2500|$|In 1994, Keys met {{long-term}} manager Jeff Robinson {{after she}} enrolled in his brother's after-school program. The following year Robinson introduced Keys to her future A at Arista Records, Peter Edge, who later described his first impressions to HitQuarters: [...] "I {{had never met}} a young R artist with that level of musicianship. So many people were just singing on top of loops and tracks, but she had the ability, not only {{to be part of}} hip-hop, but also to <b>go</b> <b>way</b> beyond that." [...] Edge helped Robinson create a showcase for Keys and also got involved in developing her demo material. He was keen to sign Keys himself but was unable to do so at that time due to being on the verge of leaving his present record company. Keys signed to Columbia Records soon after. At the same time as signing a recording contract with Columbia Records, Keys was accepted at Columbia University. At first, Keys attempted to manage both, but after a month, she dropped out of college to pursue her musical career full-time.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the age of}} 40, DeLorean {{had broken}} the record for {{youngest}} division head at GM, and was determined to continue his string of successes. Adapting to the frustrations that he perceived in the executive offices was, however, a difficult transition for him. DeLorean believed there was an undue amount of infighting at GM between divisional heads, and several of Pontiac's advertising campaign themes met with internal resistance, such as the [...] "Tiger" [...] campaign used to promote the GTO and other Pontiac models in 1965 and 1966. One of the biggest disappointments for Pontiac was the GM's fourteenth floor's Ed Cole's decision to ban multiple carburetion. Multiple carburetion had been with Pontiac since 1956 starting with 2X4 bbls. and Pontiac's famous Tri-Power (3X2bbls.) since 1957. Ironically the only GM cars to escape this ban was Ed Cole's beloved Corvair and Corvette. There are scores of this conflict with Ed Cole that <b>go</b> <b>way</b> back to Bunkie Knudsen. The most memorable would be the 1964 GTO {{was supposed to be}} equipped with disc brakes which were even tooled for free by Kelsey Hayes, and radial tires were supposed to be offered but were killed by Cole as well.|$|E
2500|$|GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann {{was less}} impressed, scoring the PC version 6 out of 10, the PS2 version 6.4 out of 10 and the Xbox version 6.6 out of 10, and calling the game [...] "a foul-mouthed and bloody {{adventure}} that does {{next to nothing}} with the characters [...] The whole experience feels flat and often self-conscious." [...] Of the PC version, he wrote [...] "even on machines that <b>go</b> <b>way</b> beyond the game's recommended system requirements, we noticed plenty of frame rate trouble and slowdown. The textures aren't pretty, and overall, the game looks like a quick and dirty console port." [...] He concluded [...] "Overall, Scarface: The World Is Yours is more a victim of some poor design choices than any glaring technical issues. [...] by taking the focus off of the gameplay elements that you'd want in an open-city game and putting it more on the game's bland mission design and all the dull side tasks you'll {{have to do to}} earn a reputation, Scarface doesn't play to its potential strengths. The end result is a functional game that presents an interesting premise, but underneath you'll find a wholly uninteresting game." [...] He was even more critical of the Wii version, scoring it 5.8 out of 10, writing [...] "the gamepad-to-Wii Remote transition has made this lackluster game play even worse." [...] He was extremely critical of the controls; [...] "while it's somewhat impressive on some level that the developer managed to cram a standard gamepad-controlled game onto the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, it's never fun to play, and you'll feel like you're fighting the controls from start to finish." ...|$|E
