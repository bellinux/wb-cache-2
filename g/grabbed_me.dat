I've had lots of friends who've gone through 'Battlefield' situations in their relationships, so when I was singing the song I put myself in their position and {{tried to imagine what}} they were going through. I got so, so into it and I think you can tell.|$|E

Tom Kessenich, in {{his book}} Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files gave the episode a more {{positive}} review, writing [...] "Perhaps I am alone in sensing the off-beat love story I found {{to be at the}} heart of 'Alpha'. But it reached out and <b>grabbed</b> <b>me</b> and I found it to be touching, interesting and worthy of analysis." ...|$|E

[...] According to Gholston, [...] "It was between periods and I was going to my next class. ...He thought I was actually somebody’s father walking down the hall. He asked me whom was I looking for. I was like, 'Nobody. I go here.' He really couldn't believe it. He kind of <b>grabbed</b> <b>me</b> at that point and put me on the team." ...|$|E

500|$|People's {{reactions}} varied: some {{described themselves}} as [...] "shocked"; others admitted to being [...] "shaky" [...] or nervous {{for the rest of}} the day. Harold Kittinger, a worker at the Suntone Factory, said, [...] "I do not care to tell anyone I was frightened. But I was not shaking in my shoes. My shoes were moving." [...] One woman hypothesized that the shaking was a [...] "bomb". Grace Standerfer suggested the earthquake was sudden, saying, [...] "I was just scared to death. My husband and I were in the house. The Venetian shades began to shake one way, then another. When that awful blast came, he <b>grabbed</b> <b>me</b> and we ran outside. Things were falling and breaking in the house. I said to him, 'This is it.' I thought the world had come to an end. Outside, wires were moving. There was no wind. The ground was quivering under our feet. I was so scared. I did not know I was scared." [...] People in the community of Mount Vernon, Illinois, were frightened by the shaking. However, some did not notice the earthquake; Jane Bessen said her party was [...] "in a car... to Evansville and didn't know about it until we got there".|$|E
2500|$|Hole formed after Eric Erlandson {{responded to}} an {{advertisement}} placed by Courtney Love in Recycler {{in the summer}} of 1989. [...] The advertisement simply read: [...] "I want to start a band. My influences are Big Black, Sonic Youth, and Fleetwood Mac." [...] "She called me up and talked my ear off," [...] said Erlandson. [...] "We met at this coffee shop, and I saw her and I thought [...] "Oh, God. Oh, no, What am I getting myself into?" [...] She <b>grabbed</b> <b>me</b> and started talking, and she's like [...] "I know you're the right one", and I hadn't even opened my mouth yet." [...] In retrospect, Love said that Erlandson [...] "had a Thurston [...] quality about him" [...] and was an [...] "intensely weird, good guitarist." [...] In his 2012 book, Letters to Kurt, Erlandson revealed that he and Love had a sexual relationship during their first year together in the band, which Love also confirmed.|$|E
2500|$|... a very {{considerable}} {{gathering of}} gold braid. The British ships, of course, were very popular {{because they were}} wet and the Americans' were dry, {{and so they were}} all having a marvellous time when the captain grabbed hold of me. I had one talent in those days, in the amusement line, and that was to give a convincing imitation of the Führer and of Winston Churchill. And the captain <b>grabbed</b> <b>me</b> and said he wanted me to address them as Hitler. And so somebody got a burnt cork and produced the moustache and a comb on the hair, and there they were assembled before me, all this mass of gold braid. And I gave them several minutes of harangue in mock-German, and eventually I finished and a great roar went up with a mass of hands going up at forty-five degrees baying [...] "Sieg, heil!, Sieg, heil!" [...] over and over again, and it's the mass of gold braid on these arms that lives in my memory.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, he can't grab but {{one at a}} time, and I'll go first. As soon as he <b>grabs</b> <b>me</b> {{the rest}} of you can slip past him, out of his reach, and he will soon let me go because I am not fit to eat." ...|$|R
2500|$|Ražnatović {{grew up in}} Belgrade {{with three}} older sisters in a strict, militaristic {{household}} with regular beatings administered by his father. In a 1991 interview he recalled: [...] "He didn't really hit me in a classical sense, he'd basically <b>grab</b> <b>me</b> and slam me against the floor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's always {{worrying}} me--when you're not around. I {{never told}} 'cause I knew you'd fight.... But now he's done it. He <b>grabbed</b> <b>me</b> and kissed me! Before all the boys!" ...|$|E

5000|$|In January 2014, Wilson {{clarified}} {{that he did}} {{not write}} any material with Beck, and that Beck would only be a guest performer. The next month, Beck intimated on the project's status: [...] "I’m not sure. As far as I know, they made a mistake by <b>grabbing</b> <b>me</b> for a tour and opening up the floodgates for a tour prematurely instead of finishing the tracks. And so we left the studio with half-finished tracks-three, four tracks I was supposed to be on and they’re still unfinished. And to me it was a bit stupid because they should have done the album, had a killer album, and then gone out on the road. But I think they wanted to <b>grab</b> <b>me</b> while I was still available. That’s about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; I've {{found that}} {{human nature is}} much the same the world over," [...] replied the detective. [...] "Of course I {{suspected}} you would undertake to give Mershone his chance by <b>grabbing</b> <b>me,</b> and that is exactly what you have done. But, my lads, what do you suppose I have done in the meantime?" ...|$|R
60|$|I'm {{bound to}} say the old boy was clay in my hands. People call me a chump, but Harold was a super-chump, and I did what I liked with him. The second morning of my visit, after breakfast, he <b>grabbed</b> <b>me</b> by the arm.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{was what}} made me so furious," [...] she admitted, shyly. [...] "I was {{surprised}} when you <b>grabbed</b> <b>me</b> off Wildfire.

6000|$|... "Oh--please don't punish him, Mr. Smith," [...] {{she burst}} out poignantly. [...] "It was all my fault. I--I stuck up my nose at Dick. He said things that--that weren't nice....

5000|$|The detectives exited {{their vehicle}} and {{approached}} Legere {{from both sides}} of his mother's car. Legere somehow obtained Parker's 9 mm Glock and shot both officers four times each, mortally wounding them. Legere would later tell police: [...] "When they tried to <b>grab</b> <b>me,</b> I wouldn't let them. I grabbed their gun and I shot them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well. It {{will help}} me home, for I feel the chilly fog from the meadows of Cardinal as if death-claws were <b>grabbing</b> <b>me</b> through and through.

5000|$|Dalila Puzzovio (born 1945) is an Argentine {{conceptual}} {{artist and}} fashion designer.

60|$|By jings, I most slumped {{through the}} floor!

5000|$|Michael Adams from 411mania {{gave the}} episode 7/10 {{saying that it}} was not a strong episode to come back from a hiatus but not bad either. [...] "Career Day itself had very little to do with this episode, even though what {{happened}} there between Phil and Gil, and Claire's breakdown, was very funny. ... the Pritchetts didn't <b>grab</b> <b>me</b> at all this week, and the Dads were funny, but nothing special." ...|$|R
5000|$|Of {{this period}} of his {{creativity}} he wrote: [...] "The saddest things {{hit me in the}} stomach.

5000|$|... "I {{just kind}} of reacted like I always did. I wasn't trying to hit a home run. Sometimes when you react to a high fastball it works out that way. Then, when I was running around the bases, fans were coming at <b>me</b> from everywhere, <b>grabbing</b> <b>me,</b> {{pounding}} me on the back. I {{was just trying to}} get around the bases and into the dugout---I ran at least one guy over---but I never made it to home plate. Later, after I got to the clubhouse, Graig Nettles said I should return to the field and touch home plate, just to make it official. But when we got back out there, home plate and all the other bases were gone, stripped from their moorings and confiscated by the delirious Yankee fans." ...|$|R
6000|$|Well, I see I was up a stump--and up it good. Providence {{had stood}} by me this fur all right, but I {{was hard and}} tight aground now.

6000|$|She <b>grabbed</b> <b>me</b> {{and hugged}} me tight; and then gripped me by {{both hands and}} shook and shook; and the tears come in her eyes, and run down over; and she couldn't seem to hug and shake enough, and kept saying, [...] "You don't look as much like your mother as I {{reckoned}} you would; but law sakes, I don't care for that, I'm {{so glad to see}} you! Dear, dear, it does seem like I could eat you up! Children, it's your cousin Tom!--tell him howdy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Couldn't he? That's all {{you know}} about him. You know I--I promised to kiss him if he beat Hartford that day. So when he came I--I did. Then the big savage began to rave and he <b>grabbed</b> <b>me</b> up in his arms. He smothered me; almost crushed {{the life out of}} me. He frightened me terribly. When I got away from him--the monster stood there and coolly said I belonged to him. I ran {{out of the room and}} wouldn't see him any more. At first I might have forgiven him if he had apologized--said he was sorry, but never a word. Now I never will forgive him." ...|$|E
