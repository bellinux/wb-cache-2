40|$|Based on {{the author}} 2 ̆ 7 s {{in-depth}} research with children diagnosed with behavioural difficulties, this book provides a thorough critique of today 2 ̆ 7 s practices, examining: * the traditional analyses of behavioural disorders {{and the making}} of disorderly children; * the influence of the 2 ̆ 7 expert knowledge 2 ̆ 7 on behavioural disorders and its influence on schools, communities and new generations of teachers; * the effect of discourses of mental disorder on children and young people; and * the increasing medicalisation of young children with drugs such as Ritalin.

Māori doctoral thesis work takes place in the intersections between the Māori (tribal) world of identifications and obligations, the organisational and epistemological configurations of academia, and the bureaucratic requirements of funding or employing bureaucracies. To explore how students accommodate cultural, academic and bureaucratic demands, we develop analytical tools combining three intellectual traditions: Māori <b>educational</b> theory, Bernstein’s <b>sociology</b> of the academy, and Lefebvre’s conceptual trilogy of perceived, conceived, and lived space...|$|R

40|$|In the 21 st {{century the}} {{majority}} of people live in urban settings and studies show a trend to the increase of this phenomenon. Globalisation and the concentration of multinational and clusters of firms in certain places are attracting people who seek employment and a better living. Many of those agglomerations are situated in developing countries, representing serious challenges both for public and private sectors. Programmes and initiatives in different countries are taking place and best practices are being exchanged globally. The objective is to transform these urban places into sustainable learning cities/regions where citizens can live with quality. The complexity of urban places, sometimes megacities, opened a new field of research. This paper argues that {{in order to understand the}} dynamics of such a complex phenomenon, a multidisciplinary, systemic approach is needed and the creation of learning cities and regions calls for the contribution of a multitude of fields of knowledge, ranging from economy to urbanism, <b>educational</b> science, <b>sociology,</b> environmental psychology and others.
