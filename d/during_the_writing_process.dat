5|$|The {{episode was}} written by {{consulting}} producer Jane Espenson and directed by Milan Cheylov. It featured the first appearance of de Ravin, who was cast as Belle in November 2011 after being approached by series co-creators Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz. Espenson created a love-themed episode; initially its main theme was to focus on Rumpelstiltskin choosing power over love, but <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> <b>process</b> Espenson decided to make him instead {{believe that he was}} not worthy of love at all.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{script was}} written by Naotaka Hayashi, a staff writer at 5pb. whose most notable work {{at the time was}} visual novel Steins;Gate. After playing through Steins;Gate on the {{recommendation}} of another staff member, Asano decided that Hayashi would be able to create the appealing characters and surprising scenario needed for the story, and asked 5pb. if Hayashi could work on Bravely Default. Another reason Asano wanted Hayashi was due to the plot's heavy use of parallel worlds. Hayashi's work on the game involved creating the plot and character settings. While he wrote the majority of the game's dialogue, more detailed work was given to writers at Square Enix and Silicon Studio. One of the supplementary writers was Silicon Studio's Keiichi Ajiro, who wrote the contents of D's Notebook. Ajiro also created the initial story outline with Asano. The initial story concept was kept deliberately simple, but its complexity increased <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> <b>process.</b> During his work, Hayashi was given guidelines by Square Enix about the characters and story: for instance, Asano wanted the heroes and villains to be equally compelling, along with raising the game's targeted age group. Something that Hayashi needed to remember <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> <b>process</b> was the need to limit the length of dialogue segments. While visual novels had a high leeway for dialogue quantity, Asano would make requests such as a sentence being within a 22-character limit, and to not overrun into multiple dialogue boxes.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s and 2000s, Alasdair Cochrane studied {{politics}} at the University of Sheffield and the London School of Economics (LSE). His doctoral thesis, supervised by Cécile Fabre with Paul Kelly acting as an adviser, was entitled Moral obligations to non-humans. He subsequently became a fellow and lecturer at the LSE. During this time, Cochrane published articles in Res Publica, Utilitas and Political Studies presenting aspects of his interest-based theory of animal rights, which is defended in the final chapter of An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory. The book was Cochrane's first, and the political theorist Robert Garner acted as an important discussant <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
25|$|The author died in 2007 {{while working}} on what was planned to be the twelfth and final volume in the series.

25|$|Martin {{originally}} {{planned for the}} fourth book to be called A Dance with Dragons with the story picking up {{five years after the}} events of A Storm of Swords (primarily to advance the ages of the younger characters). However, <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> <b>process</b> it was discovered that this was leading to an overreliance on flashbacks to fill in the gap. After twelve months or so of working on the book, Martin decided to abandon much of what had previously been written and start again, this time picking up immediately after the end of A Storm of Swords. He announced this decision, along with the new title A Feast for Crows, at Worldcon in Philadelphia on September 1, 2001. He also announced that A Dance with Dragons would now be the fifth book in the sequence.|$|E
50|$|Being {{a serial}} technology, SPL is {{inherently}} slower than e.g. photolithography or nanoimprint lithography, while parallelization as required for mass-fabrication {{is considered a}} large systems engineering effort (see also Millipede memory). As for resolution, SPL methods bypass the optical diffraction limit due to their use of scanning probes compared with photolithographic methods. Some probes have integrated in-situ metrology capabilities, allowing for feedback control <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>write</b> <b>process.</b> SPL works under ambient atmospheric conditions, {{without the need for}} ultra high vacuum (UHV), unlike e-beam or EUV lithography.|$|R

25|$|In 1959, Alan Jay Lerner and Moss Hart {{decided to}} adapt T. H. White's The Once and Future King as their next project. As {{discussed}} in Lerner's 1978 book, The Street Where I Live, Frederick Loewe, who initially {{had no interest}} in the project, agreed to write music, with the understanding that if things went badly, it would be his last score. After the tremendous success of My Fair Lady, expectations were high for a new Lerner and Loewe musical. However, the show's production met several obstacles. Lerner's wife left him <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> <b>process,</b> causing him to seek medical attention and delaying the production. When Camelot began rehearsals, it still needed considerable work. However, the producers were able to secure a strong cast, including Julie Andrews, Richard Burton, and Roddy McDowall, as well as Robert Goulet in his first Broadway role. John Cullum also made his Broadway debut as Sir Dinadan; Bruce Yarnell was Sir Lionel. Cullum later replaced McDowall, and William Squire replaced Burton. Other replacements included Patricia Bredin, Kathryn Grayson and Janet Pavek for Andrews.|$|E

500|$|During {{the period}} in which he wrote Cryptonomicon, Stephenson read George Dyson's Darwin Amongst the Machines, which led him to Gottfried Leibniz's {{interest}} in a computing machine, the Leibniz–Newton feud, and Newton's work at the Royal Treasury.

Originally intended to be included in Cryptonomicon, Stephenson instead used the material as the foundation for Quicksilver, the first volume of the Baroque Cycle.
