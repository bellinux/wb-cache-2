30|$|Lost {{circulation}} {{has been}} a serious problem while drilling {{that may lead to}} heavy financial costs in the form of lost rig time and lost mud fluid. In severe cases, it can lead to well blowout with serious environmental hazards and safety consequences. Despite extensive advances {{in the last couple of}} decades, lost circulation materials used today still have disadvantages such as damaging production zones, failing to seal large fractures or plugging drilling tools. Here, we propose a new class of smart expandable lost circulation material (LCM) to remotely control the <b>expanding</b> <b>force</b> and functionality of the injected LCM. Our smart LCM is made out of shape memory polymers that become activated by formation’s natural heat. Once activated, these particles can effectively seal fractures’ width without damaging pores in the production zone or plugging drilling tools. The activation temperature of the proposed LCM can be adjusted based on the formation’s temperature. We conducted a series of experiments to measure the sealing efficiency of these smart LCMs as a proof of concept study. Various slot disk sizes were used to mimic different size fractures in the formation. The API RP 13 B- 1 and 13 B- 2 have been followed as standard testing methods to evaluate this product.|$|E
40|$|Extraction and {{reconstruction}} of rectal wall structures from an ultrasound image is helpful for surgeons in rectal clinical diagnosis and 3 -D reconstruction of rectal structures from ultrasound images. The primary {{task is to}} extract the boundary of the muscular layers on the rectal wall. However, due to the low SNR from ultrasound imaging and the thin muscular layer structure of the rectum, this boundary detection task remains a challenge. An active contour model is an effective high-level model, which has been used successfully to aid the tasks of object representation and recognition in many image-processing applications. We present a novel multigradient field active contour algorithm with an extended ability for multiple-object detection, which overcomes some limitations of ordinary active contour models—"snakes. " The core part in the algorithm is the proposal of multigradient vector fields, which are used to replace image forces in kinetic function for alternative constraints on the deformation of active contour, thereby partially solving the initialization limitation of active contour for rectal wall boundary detection. An adaptive <b>expanding</b> <b>force</b> is also added to the model to help the active contour go through the homogenous region in the image. The efficacy of the model is explained and tested on the boundary detection of a ring-shaped image, a synthetic image, and an ultrasound image.

40|$|The nitinol stent is a self-expandable spiral stent made of nickel-titanium alloy. We {{performed}} {{a pilot study}} to evaluate the method of stent insertion and stent efficacy. Twenty-eight patients with irresectable malignancy had nitinol stents inserted for obstructive jaundice due to distal biliary strictures. They were followed prospectively for a median of ten weeks (range 1 - 48) until stent occlusion or death. All patients underwent sphincterotomy prior to stent insertion. Stent deployment was assisted by subsequent balloon dilation of the stent in two patients. Plastic stent insertion was used to temporarily brace the nitinol stent in another three patients. Short-term relief of jaundice was achieved in 20 of the 28 patients (71 %). The remaining eight patients had persistent jaundice due to failure of stent insertion (three patients) or early stent dysfunction (five patients). Long-term success was achieved in 12 of 28 patients (43 %). Ten of the 12 patients died without complications after a median of 13. 5 weeks (range 3 - 48). One of the 12 patients is still alive with the stent in place for 40 weeks, and one patient underwent elective bypass surgery, and the stent was removed surgically. Eight of the 28 patients had recurrent symptoms due to late stent dysfunction after a median of 19 weeks (range 6 - 32). Nitinol stents are technically difficult to insert.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the feasibility of}} percutaneous aortic valve replacement without cardiac arrest in animal experiments. Methods: A self expanding nitinol stent, containing pulmonary valves from pigs in its proximal part, was implanted in six pigs (94 - 118 kg) {{by means of a}} 25 French catheter through the left subclavian artery under guidance of fluoroscopy and transoesophageal echocardiography. During stent deployment the original aortic valve was pushed against the aortic wall by the self <b>expanding</b> <b>force</b> of the stent while the new valve was expanded. Results: It was possible to replace the aortic valve in the beating heart in four pigs (67 %) with no complication or relevant drop in blood pressure. The procedure failed in two pigs (33 %) due to dysfunction of the catheter device in one case and to problems with correct positioning in the left ventricular outflow tract in the other. After successful stent valve implantation, dopamine was infused in doses of 5 µg/kg/min, 10 µg/kg/min, and 15 µg/kg/min. Cardiac output increased from 4. 4 to 8. 8 l/min and the mean arterial pressure rose from 79 to 105 mm Hg. The maximum peak to peak pressure gradient across the valve carrying stent reached a maximum of 8 mm Hg under dopamine infusion. All pigs were killed six hours after transvascular aortic valve replacement. The chest was opened, and the left ventricle and the ascending aorta were carefully inspected. There were no signs of malfunction of the implant, of damage of the aortic vessel wall, or of obstruction of the coronary ostia. Conclusions: Percutaneous aortic valve replacement with a self expanding nitinol stent in the beating heart is possible. The device was safe under pharmacological stress test. After successful chronic animal experiments, this concept may become a feasible option for treating patients with relevant aortic valve disease but where open heart surgery would be risky...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This report {{describes}} a possible product {{design in the}} field of medical engineering, clarifying the constructive design performance of minute medical parts. It is known as a stent, and is a mesh-shaped tube made of a shape memory alloy of nickel and titanium (Nitinol), 2 mm in diameter, 30 - 40 mm long, wire width 0. 15 mm and wire thickness 0. 15 - 0. 2 mm. Watching X-ray pictures, a doctor pushes out a stent which is built into a catheter (2 mm in diameter), into the lesion where flow through a blood vessel or ureter is blocked. The stent self-expands its diameter from 2 mm to 6 - 12 mm (3 - 6 times). As a result, the diameter of vessel expands and is maintained. The stent must satisfy the following design demands. When bent 180 degrees, its cylindrical shape must be maintained. The mesh-shaped tube must flexibly follow the bending vessel without injuring the arterial wall. When it expands 3 - 6 times, the mechanical strength must be kept and it must not lose its <b>expanding</b> <b>force.</b> If built in a catheter (2 mm in diameter), it must also bend. We researched the deformation mechanism and the relation between the construction and shape of the wire. After many of experimental designs and trial productions over 4 years, an original product model was obtained that has conspicuous flexibility, expansion properties and bending properties compared with other overseas stents. From several mechanical testing experiments, it was found that an organic design using a free curved line and a low angle of inclination provides flexibility and expansion properties, and eases stress. We believe that the role of design {{in the field of}} medical engineering is important...|$|E
