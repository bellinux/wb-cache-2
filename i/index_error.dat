6000|$|And now, {{in simple}} language. I shall {{describe}} how I taught myself navigation. One whole afternoon I {{sat in the}} cockpit, steering {{with one hand and}} studying logarithms with the other. Two afternoons, two hours each, I studied the general theory of navigation and the particular process of taking a meridian altitude. Then I took the sextant, worked out the <b>index</b> <b>error,</b> and shot the sun. The figuring from the data of this observation was child's play. In the [...] "Epitome" [...] and the [...] "Nautical Almanac" [...] were scores of cunning tables, all worked out by mathematicians and astronomers. It was like using interest tables and lightning-calculator tables such as you all know. The mystery was mystery no longer. I put my finger on the chart and announced that that was where we were. I was right too, or at least I was as right as Roscoe, who selected a spot {{a quarter of a mile}} away from mine. Even he was willing to split the distance with me. I had exploded the mystery, and yet, such was the miracle of it, I was conscious of new power in me, and I felt the thrill and tickle of pride. And when Martin asked me, in the same humble and respectful way I had previously asked Roscoe, as to where we were, it was with exaltation and spiritual chest-throwing that I answered in the cipher-code of the higher priesthood and heard Martin's self- abasing and worshipful [...] "Oh." [...] As for Charmian, I felt that in a new way I had proved my right to her; and I was aware of another feeling, namely, that she was a most fortunate woman to have a man like me.|$|E
60|$|I couldn't help it. I tell it as a {{vindication of}} Roscoe {{and all the}} other navigators. The poison of power was working in me. I was not as other men--most other men; I knew what they did not know,-- the mystery of the heavens, that pointed out the way across the deep. And the taste of power I had {{received}} drove me on. I steered at the wheel long hours with one hand, and studied mystery with the other. By the end of the week, teaching myself, I was able to do divers things. For instance, I shot the North Star, at night, of course; got its altitude, corrected for <b>index</b> <b>error,</b> dip, etc., and found our latitude. And this latitude agreed with the latitude of the previous noon corrected by dead reckoning up to that moment. Proud? Well, I was even prouder with my next miracle. I was going to turn in at nine o'clock. I worked out the problem, self- instructed, and learned what star of the first magnitude would be passing the meridian around half-past eight. This star proved to be Alpha Crucis. I had never heard of the star before. I looked it up on the star map. It was {{one of the stars of}} the Southern Cross. What! thought I; have we been sailing with the Southern Cross in the sky of nights and never known it? Dolts that we are! Gudgeons and moles! I couldn't believe it. I went over the problem again, and verified it. Charmian had the wheel from eight till ten that evening. I told her to keep her eyes open and look due south for the Southern Cross. And when the stars came out, there shone the Southern Cross low on the horizon. Proud? No medicine man nor high priest was ever prouder. Furthermore, with the prayer-wheel I shot Alpha Crucis and from its altitude worked out our latitude. And still furthermore, I shot the North Star, too, and it agreed with what had been told me by the Southern Cross. Proud? Why, the language of the stars was mine, and I listened and heard them telling me my way over the deep.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{evaluate}} the influences of optical property assumptions on near-infrared diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) flow index measurements. The optical properties, absorption coefficient (µa) and reduced scattering coefficient (µs′), are independently varied using liquid phantoms and measured concurrently with the flow index using a hybrid optical system combining a dual-wavelength DCS flow device with a commercial frequency-domain tissue-oximeter. DCS flow indices are calculated at two wavelengths (785 and 830 nm) using measured µa and µs′ or assumed constant µa and µs′. Inaccurate µs′ assumptions resulted in much greater flow <b>index</b> <b>errors</b> than inaccurate µa. Underestimated/overestimated µs′ from − 35 %/+ 175 % lead to flow <b>index</b> <b>errors</b> of + 110 %/− 80 %, whereas underestimated/overestimated µa from − 40 %/+ 150 % lead to − 20 %/+ 40 %, regardless of the wavelengths used.

40|$|Retrieval of size {{distributions}} from multispectral {{optical depth}} measurements requires solution of an illposed inverse problem. The illposedness causes {{problems such as}} solution ambiguity. Size distribution retrieval becomes more complicated {{in the presence of}} nonspherical particles and/or refractive <b>index</b> <b>errors.</b> A new retrieval algorithm is first developed that allows for both smoothing and nonnegativity constraint along with the Lcurve method for choosing the Lagrange multiplier that controls the degree of the imposed smoothing. This new algorithm is compared with an iterative algorithm and the method of truncated singular value decomposition, demonstrating that the new algorithm outperforms the other two. With the new algorithm to perform the size distribution retrieval and with the T-matrix method to calculate optical depth for a given cloud consisting of randomly oriented finite circular cylinders, the influence of particle nonsphericity on the size distribution retrieval is investigated by use of the Mie theory for spheres as well as the anomalous diffraction theory for cylinders. The results show that spurious particles and even spurious particle modes occur for both approximations. The effect of refractive <b>index</b> <b>errors</b> are also investigated, showing that even a small perturbation of refractive indices can cause serious distortions of retrieved size distributions. A further examination reveals that either applying an approximate light scattering theory (Mie theory or anomalous diffraction theory) to nonspherical particles or using incorrect refractive indices results in systematic errors in the model which in turn conspire with the illposedness inherent in the retrieval to cause the distortions of retrieved size distributions. The retrieval process essentially t [...] ...|$|R

Our previous {{work on a}} manual SST showed that subjects ’ readiness {{to respond to the}} go signal {{and the extent to which}} subjects monitor their errors need to be considered in order to attribute impaired performance to deficits in response inhi-bition. Here we examine whether these same task-related variables similarly influence oculomotor SST and anti-saccade performance. Thirty-six and sixty healthy, adult subjects participated in an oculomotor SST and anti-saccade task, respec-tively, in which the fore-period (FP) of imperative stimulus varied randomly from trial to trial. We computed a FP effect to index response readiness to the imperative stimulus and a post-error slowing (PES) effect to <b>index</b> <b>error</b> monitoring.

40|$|The {{ensemble}} size in sequential atmospheric ensemble based data assimilation {{using the}} Heikes and Randall (1995 a,b) global shallow-water model {{is reduced by}} projecting the ensemble on {{a limited number of}} its leading EOFs. The ensemble size is determined by retaining the modes containg the main directions of variability of the system (most energetic modes of the flow). The efficiency of this approach for adaptively updating the ensemble size in the Maximum Likehood Ensemble Filter (MLEF) by Zupanski (2005), Zupanski et al. (2005) used for ensemble data assimilation is assessed for different fractions of variability conserved and compared in terms of rms and similarity <b>index</b> <b>error</b> indicators with the full ensemble run. An illustration of the feasibility and effectiveness of the method is presented in framework of twin experiments for the above shallow water model. A reduction of up to a factor of four in the number of members of the ensemble was obtained, yielding comparable ensemble data assimilation (ENSDA) results with the full ensemble run. This novel approach results in sizable computational resource economy for general ensemble data assimilation methods. ...|$|E
40|$|In most {{algorithms}} {{of global}} illumination, light–surface interaction terminates declaring that result {{at some point}} is close enough to some reference ground truth data. The underlying principle of such criterion is to minimize the processing time without compromising the (subjective) visual perception of the resulting image. We introduce an objective-driven condition for stopping the simulation of light transport. It is inspired by the physical meaning of light propagation. Besides, it takes into account that computations are performed in finite precision. Its main feature {{is the definition of}} the threshold establishing the maximum number of pixels that are completed in finite precision. Its value is computed at run time depending on the brightness of the image.

40|$|This work {{describes}} a non-linear dynamic {{model for the}} study of the vibration signals generated by gear transmissions. The developed model considers both the parametric excitations due to the variable compliance of bearings and gears, can handle changes in the transmitted torque and allows the integration of the dynamic equations quickly and accurately. This model has been developed previously by the authors to assess the profile deviations on the dynamic behavior of gear transmissions and its influence on the transmitted torque. It also includes the presence of gear defects as cracks and pitting during the calculation of meshing forces. In this paper, the model has been enhanced in order to include two common defects such as <b>index</b> <b>errors</b> and run out or eccentricity <b>errors.</b> <b>Index</b> <b>errors</b> occur as a result of a non-uniform angular distribution of the tooth profiles along the pitch circle. Run out appears due to the displacement of the geometric center of the gear with respect to the center of rotation of the shaft on which it is mounted. Although both errors are caused by different reasons, sometimes they have been confused because of their similitudes. The procedure for including both kinds of errors in the model is described and simulations under several transmitted torques are presented. The results are assessed and compared focusing the attention on certain transmission parameters and magnitudes as transmission error, load forces in the tooth flanks and demodulation techniques on the resulting vibratory signals.
