60|$|Reader, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>blame</b> me if I said yes? I was young, ardent, ambitious, full {{of bright}} hopes and boyish enthusiasm.|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>blame</b> me for {{not telling}} before?" [...] She made an {{involuntary}} movement toward him, a pathetic gesture which both entreated and compassionated.|$|E
6000|$|CAIN [rising] You did well: I, too, do {{not want}} to live for ever. But if you invented death, why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>blame</b> me, who am a {{minister}} of death? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lady Eustace is not <b>blaming</b> <b>you,</b> and <b>do</b> not <b>you</b> <b>blame</b> anybody else," [...] said Lord George. [...] "Let {{the police}} do what is right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can {{say that}} with most perfect truth. I <b>do</b> not <b>blame</b> <b>you.</b> It has been most unfortunate; but I <b>do</b> not <b>blame</b> <b>you.</b> I am {{sure that you have}} {{struggled}} to do the best that you could." ...|$|R
60|$|ANNA--[Wearily.] Sure I <b>do.</b> <b>You</b> ain't to <b>blame.</b> You're yust--what <b>you</b> are--like me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your own fault," [...] said Uncle John. [...] "You {{wanted me}} {{to play a game}} with you, and I agreed, providin' you behaved yourself. And you didn't. Now, look here. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>blame</b> me any?" ...|$|E
6000|$|CONJURER. You {{have already}} {{told me what}} he did. He {{destroyed}} a fairy tale, for he created a fairy tale that he was bound to destroy. [Swinging round suddenly on the table.] But <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>blame</b> a man very much, Miss Carleon, if he enjoyed the only fairy tale he had had in his life? Suppose he said the silly circles he was drawing for practice were really magic circles? Suppose he said the bosh he was talking was {{the language of the}} elves? Remember, he has read fairy tales as much as you have. Fairy tales are the only democratic institutions. All the classes have heard all the fairy tales. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>blame</b> him very much if he, too, tried to have a holiday in fairyland? ...|$|E
6000|$|After that concession, she was amiability itself. [...] "Oh, yes," [...] {{she assured}} me, [...] "that's easily done." [...] And {{she went on}} accordingly: [...] "Philip having {{informed}} me {{of the state of}} his affections, I naturally followed his example. In fact, we exchanged confessions. Our marriage engagement followed as a matter of course. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>blame</b> me?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Avoid <b>doing</b> what <b>you</b> would <b>blame</b> {{others for}} doing." [...] - Thales (c. 624-546 BC) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I {{was in a}} fix--an infernal fix. And he made me wild too--hunting {{me about}} the house, fooling about with his revolver, locking and {{unlocking}} doors. He was simply exasperating. <b>You</b> don't <b>blame</b> me, <b>do</b> <b>you?</b> <b>You</b> don't <b>blame</b> me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Is {{it not for}} {{the best}} that affairs should have taken the course they have <b>done?</b> But <b>you</b> must <b>blame</b> Kate as well as me; dear Kate!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No! How could I refuse, {{in so many}} words? And I {{was frightened}} and confused, any way. He asked {{if we were going}} to the music in the Giardini Pubblici; and I said No, that Miss Mayhew was not going into society in Venice, but was merely here for her health. That's all there is of it. Now <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>blame</b> me, Owen?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>blame</b> me, too? What if {{the thing}} I'm doing now {{should make it}} a winter resort? Nothing could save you, then, but a fire. I believe that's Jeff's ambition. Only {{he would want to}} put another hotel in place of this; {{something}} that would be more popular. Then the ruin I began would be complete, and I shouldn't come any more; I couldn't bear the sight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You grant me a liberty {{which you}} would not concede to another girl." [...] That was how she viewed it. [...] "We are getting on better already. To return to what I was saying. When Philip first saw me--I have it from himself, mind--he felt that I should have been his choice, if he had met with me before he met with my sister. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>blame</b> him?" ...|$|E
60|$|ADAM. I <b>do</b> not <b>blame</b> <b>you.</b> Go in peace. Leave {{me to my}} digging, {{and your}} mother to her spinning.|$|R
60|$|GILBEY. Thats enough: I dont {{want any}} excuses. I <b>dont</b> <b>blame</b> <b>you.</b> You can go downstairs now, if youve {{nothing else to}} trouble me about.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{want you}} to know that I <b>do</b> not <b>blame</b> <b>you</b> in the least for {{anything}} <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> No action of yours can ever lessen my affection for you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gentlemen of the jury," [...] said Alf Copper, {{hitching}} up what war {{had left}} to him of trousers--"you've 'eard what 'e's been fed up with. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>blame</b> the beggar? 'Cause I don't! ... Leave 'im alone, McBride. He's my first and only cap-ture, an' I'm goin' to walk 'ome with 'im, ain't I, Ducky? ... Fall in, Burjer. It's Bermuda, or Umballa, or Ceylon for you--and I'd give a month's pay {{to be in your}} little shoes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am glad of that," [...] {{returned}} Florida, [...] "for I {{have thought}} it all over many times, and I know that I was not to blame, though at first I blamed myself. I never intended him anything but good. That is my consolation, Mr. Ferris. But you," [...] she added, [...] "you seem to make yourself my judge. Well, and what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>blame</b> me for? I {{have a right to}} know what is in your mind." ...|$|E
60|$|Yes, my {{very dear}} friend, I {{could not bear}} to let that frigid, rigid exercise, called a version and called mine, cold as Caucasus, and flat as the {{neighbouring}} plain, stand as my work. A palinodia, a recantation was necessary to me, and I have achieved it. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>blame</b> me or not? Perhaps I may print it in a magazine, but this is not decided. How delighted I am to think of your being well. It makes me very happy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not much, Captain 'Oshspur--not at fust starting. I'm a {{going to}} have my money, you know, Captain 'Oshspur. And if I see my vay to my money one vay, and if I don't see no vay the other vay, vy, vhat's a man to <b>do?</b> <b>You</b> can't <b>blame</b> me, Captain 'Oshspur. I've been very indulgent with you; I have, Captain 'Oshspur." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am almost glad <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>blame</b> me,' said John cheerfully, 'since, {{if you had}} not, {{the letter}} would not have come. I have read it fifty times a day.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{ought to}} have told me at first, Walter. I <b>do</b> not <b>blame</b> <b>you,</b> but <b>you</b> should not <b>do</b> things on your own responsibility." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{answered}} 'No: in one case, he is ignorant; in the other, he is right. On {{leaving his}} house, I found myself {{followed in the}} street by the man to whom I owe the shame and misery of my past life. My horror of him {{is not to be}} described in words. The one way of escaping was offered by an empty cab that passed me. I reached the railway station safely, and went back to my home in the country. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>blame</b> me?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Watcher-by-Night," [...] he said, [...] "why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>blame</b> me {{for these}} events, {{when you know}} that I am nobody in my own House? I say that I am a dead man, whose sons fight for his inheritance. I cannot tell you for certain who it was that drove away your oxen. Still, I am glad that they are gone, since I {{believe that if you}} had {{attempted}} to trek to Natal just now you would have been killed on the road by the Usutu, who believe you to be a councillor of Umbelazi." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You know why, Arranmore," [...] she said, quietly. [...] "If {{you were}} the man I {{remember}} many years ago, the man I have wasted many hours of my life thinking about, I would not hesitate for a moment. I loved that man, and I have always loved him. But, Arranmore, I cannot recognize him in you. If these terrible things which you have suffered, these follies which you have committed, have withered you up so that there remains {{no trace of the}} man I once cared for, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>blame</b> me for refusing you? I will not marry a stranger, Arranmore, and I not only don't know you, but I am a little afraid of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not <b>blame</b> me?" [...] asked Campbell, with a subdued, almost deprecatory voice, such as Thurnall {{had never}} heard in him before.|$|R
6000|$|<b>You</b> <b>did</b> late review my lays, [...] Crusty Christopher; [...] <b>You</b> <b>did</b> mingle <b>blame</b> and praise, [...] Rusty Christopher. [...] When I learnt {{from whom}} it came, [...] I forgave <b>you</b> all the <b>blame,</b> [...] Musty Christopher; [...] I could not forgive the praise, [...] Fusty Christopher.|$|R
6000|$|Finally I ran {{up against}} him {{carrying}} an armful of tools out of a shed, and he dropped them at sight of me. [...] "Hallo! Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> spring from? <b>Blamed</b> hard luck, isn't it?" [...] said he.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{you have}} not done anything; I take it back. It is all right. But when I came here this morning--encouraged--hoping--that you had the same feeling as myself, and you seem to forget {{everything}} but a ceremonious acquaintanceship--why, it is all right, of course. I {{have no reason to}} complain; but I must say that I can't help being surprised." [...] He saw her lips quiver and her bosom heave. [...] "Marcia, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>blame</b> me for feeling hurt at your coldness when I came here to tell you--to tell you I--I love you?" [...] With his nerves all unstrung, and his hunger for sympathy, he really believed that he had come to tell her this. [...] "Yes," [...] he added, bitterly, I will tell you, though {{it seems to be the}} last word I shall speak to you. I'll go, now." ...|$|E
60|$|WHEN WILL THE CIRCLE JOIN? How {{long before}} the whole of your prophecy will be {{fulfilled}} I cannot say, but {{under the shadow of}} so much fulfillment in so short a time, and with such threats from a man {{who is one of the}} most prominent exponents of the San Francisco mining-ring staring me and this whole community defiantly in the face and pointing to a completion of your augury, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>blame</b> me for feeling that this communication is the last I shall ever write for the Press, especially when a sense alike of personal self-respect, of duty to this money-oppressed and fear-ridden community, and of American fealty to the spirit of true Liberty all command me, and each more loudly than love of life itself, to declare the name of that prominent man to be JOHN B. WINTERS, President of the Yellow Jacket Company, a political aspirant and a military General? The name of his partially duped accomplice and abettor in this last marvelous assault, is no other than PHILIP LYNCH, Editor and Proprietor of the Gold Hill News.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] Amelius proceeded, [...] "now let us get on. Suppose we take {{a glance}} (we {{have no time to}} do more) at the present state of our {{religious}} system, first. What is the public aspect of the thing called Christianity, in the England of our day? A hundred different sects all at variance with each other. An established church, rent in every direction by incessant wrangling--disputes about black gowns or white; about having candlesticks on tables, or off tables; about bowing to the east or bowing to the west; about which doctrine collects the most respectable support and possesses the largest sum of money, the doctrine in my church, or the doctrine in your church, or the doctrine in the church over the way. Look up, if you like, from this multitudinous and incessant squabbling among the rank and file, to the high regions in which the right reverend representatives of state religion sit apart. Are they Christians? If they are, show me the Bishop who dare assert his Christianity in the House of Lords, when the ministry of the day happens to see its advantage in engaging in a war! Where is that Bishop, and how many supporters does he count among his own order? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>blame</b> me for using intemperate language--language which I cannot justify? Take a fair test, and try me by that. The result of the Christianity of the New Testament is to make men true, humane, gentle, modest, strictly scrupulous and strictly considerate in their dealings with their neighbours. Does the Christianity of the churches and the sects produce these results among us? Look at the staple of the country, at the occupation which employs the largest number of Englishmen of all degrees--Look at our Commerce. What is its social aspect, judged by the morality which is in this book in my hand? Let those organised systems of imposture, masquerading under the disguise of banks and companies, answer the question--there is no need for me to answer it. You know what respectable names are associated, year after year, with the shameless falsification of accounts, and the merciless ruin of thousands on thousands of victims. You know how our poor Indian customer finds his cotton-print dress a sham that falls to pieces; how the savage who deals honestly with us for his weapon finds his gun a delusion that bursts; how the half-starved needlewoman who buys her reel of thread finds printed on the label a false statement of the number of yards that she buys; you know that, in the markets of Europe, foreign goods are fast taking the place of English goods, because the foreigner is the most honest manufacturer of the two--and, lastly, you know, what is worse than all, that these cruel and wicked deceptions, and many more like them, are regarded, on the highest commercial authority, as 'forms of competition' and justifiable proceedings in trade. Do you believe in the honourable accumulation of wealth by men who hold such opinions and perpetrate such impostures as these? I don't! Do you find any brighter and purer prospect when you look down from the man who deceives you and me on the great scale, to the man who deceives us on the small? I don't! Everything we eat, drink, and wear is a more or less adulterated commodity; and that very adulteration is sold to us by the tradesmen at such outrageous prices, that we are obliged to protect ourselves on the Socialist principle, by setting up cooperative shops of our own. Wait! and hear me out, before you applaud. Don't mistake the plain purpose of what I am saying to you; and don't suppose that I am blind to the brighter side of the dark picture that I have drawn. Look within the limits of private life, and you will find true Christians, thank God, among clergymen and laymen alike; you will find men and women who deserve to be called, in the highest sense of the word, disciples of Christ. But my business is not with private life--my business is with the present public aspect of the religion, morals, and politics of this country; and again I say it, that aspect presents one wide field of corruption and abuse, and reveals a callous and shocking insensibility {{on the part of the}} nation at large to the spectacle of its own demoralisation and disgrace." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Stop, Mr. Dewes!" [...] he said firmly. [...] "I <b>do</b> not <b>blame</b> <b>you</b> for {{assuming}} what <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> but <b>you</b> are mistaken. I am not guilty.
