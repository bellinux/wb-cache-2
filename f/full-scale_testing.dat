Computers are used to perform the calculations required to simulate the interaction of liquids and gases with surfaces defined by boundary conditions.

Ongoing research yields software that improves the accuracy and speed of complex simulation scenarios such as transonic or turbulent flows.

25|$|Project Wing is {{a project}} that aims to rapidly deliver {{products}} across a city by using flying vehicles, similar to the Amazon Prime Air concept.

The flying vehicles take off vertically, then rotate to a horizontal position for flying around. For delivery, it hovers and winches packages down to the ground. At the end of the tether is a small bundle of electronics which detects that the package has hit the ground, detaches from the delivery, and is pulled back up into the body of the vehicle. Dropping the cargo or landing were found to be unfeasible, as users compromised the safety.|$|E

[...] Each company delivered 22 vehicles and six trailers to Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, and Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona. [...] Previous testing had already put the vehicles through more than 400 ballistic and blast tests on armor testing samples, underbody blast testing, and more than 1,000 miles in shakedown testing. [...] Soldiers from the Army Test and Evaluation Command and personnel from the Defense Department's Office of Test and Evaluation would put the vehicles through realistic and rigorous field testing during 14 months of government performance testing. [...] Testing was {{to be completed by}} FY 2015, with a production contract to be awarded to a single vendor for nearly 55,000 vehicles, with each vehicle coming off the assembly line not exceeding $250,000. [...] The Army is to begin receiving JLTVs by FY 2018, and have all their vehicles planned to be delivered in the 2030s. On 3 September 2013, full-pace, full-scope JLTV testing began at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Yuma Proving Ground, and Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. [...] The program is on track despite sequestration, but if budget issues are not worked out the schedule could slip. [...] One vendor will be selected by July 2015, and produce 2,000 vehicles for three years of additional testing to fine-tune the assembly line and full-up the system.|$|E
40|$|Safety is an {{important}} aspect when designing bridges and roads. One aspect among others to consider is the road restraint systems. The focus {{of this study was}} centered to safety barriers which are the vehicle parapets/guardrails. The parapet must meet certain requirements specified in European Standard in order to obtain a CE-marking, indicating the acceptance of use. <b>Full-scale</b> <b>test</b> must be performed for a proposed parapet to evaluate the performance. Often several <b>full-scale</b> <b>tests</b> are performed in order to achieve CE-marking, making it an expensive process. The primary objective of this master thesis was to investigate if Abaqus/Explicit could be used as the finite element software for simulation of crashes. Secondary objective was to investigate how well a performed full-scale crash could be simulated in Abaqus/Explicit. A <b>full-scale</b> <b>test</b> was conducted and the parapet installation and vehicle used was modeled. Same conditions as in the full-scale were used in the simulation. The results indicated {{that it is possible to}} simulate the full-scale crash using Abaqus/Explicit. However, the behavior of the <b>full-scale</b> <b>test</b> was not completely captured. The maximum dynamic and permanent horizontal deflection of the tabular thrie beam in the <b>full-scale</b> <b>test</b> was 582 mm and 515 mm, corresponding value from the simulation was 703 mm and 643 mm. The conclusion from the results is that Abaqus/Explicit is a suitable finite element software for simulating crashes. The differences between the <b>full-scale</b> <b>test</b> and the simulations in this master thesis were due to the simplifications and assumptions used when modeling the parapet, bridge deck and the vehicle. The overall global behavior of the <b>full-scale</b> <b>test</b> was not captured, however the simulation results were not far from the <b>full-scale</b> <b>test</b> even though rough simplifications and assumptions were used in the modeling. We believe that with more care to details in modeling, it should be possible to have better convergence between simulation and the <b>full-scale</b> <b>test...</b>|$|R
40|$|Load-carrying in two {{directions}} in lattice girder slab systems by complementing with lapped reinforcement across the joints at the construction site was studied. A detailing of load-carrying joints without any reinforcement across the cast joint was considered. The behaviour of the cast joint between the precast concrete and the in situ cast concrete is very important. Two different surface treatments were tested in two types of detail tests of the cast joint: one type in which the cast joint was loaded in shear, and one in tension. Furthermore, the detailing of the joint between two precast concrete panels was tested in bending in <b>full-scale</b> <b>tests.</b> The detail tests were used to calibrate a friction model of the cast joint, which was then used in finite-element analyses (FEAs) of the <b>full-scale</b> <b>tests.</b> In the <b>full-scale</b> <b>tests,</b> the joints were strong enough to carry the applied load; thus, the failure mode was rupture of the reinforcement in all <b>full-scale</b> <b>tests,</b> and only one crack occurred—in the in situ cast concrete above the joint between the precast elements.

40|$|This paper summarises {{the results}} of a study in which the maximum {{vertical}} contact stresses of the 1 / 3 rd scale test tyres of the Model Mobile Load Simulator (MMLS 3) were compared with those measured for three types of <b>full-scale</b> <b>test</b> tyres of the Heavy Vehicle Simulator (HVS). The comparative tests were done using the Stress-In-Motion (SIM) device designed to capture three-dimensional (3 D) tyre-pavement contact stresses on a relatively rough-textured test surface. As it is generally accepted that these stress conditions within the moving tyre contact patch are quite complex, a single parameter of the vertical stresses measured for the different test tyres was selected for the comparison. This parameter, referred to as the Maximum Vertical Contact Stress (MVCS) indicated, on average, that it increased linearly with tyre inflation pressure for both types of the 1 / 3 rd scale MMLS 3 <b>test</b> tyres and <b>full-scale</b> <b>test</b> tyres. However, {{it was found that the}} MVCSs for the Diamond patterned square profile 1 / 3 rd scale tyres of the MMLS 3 were, on average, much lower than those of the <b>full-scale</b> <b>test</b> tyres as they represented, at most, only 52. 5 per cent of those measured for the 11 R 22. 5 (<b>full-scale</b> HVS) <b>test</b> tyre, 37. 5 per cent for the single 315 / 80 R 22. 5 (<b>full-scale</b> HVS) <b>test</b> tyre, and 12. 5 per cent and 20 per cent respectively respectively for the smooth and rough-texture tests on the 12 R 22. 5 (<b>full-scale</b> HVS) <b>test</b> tyre.
