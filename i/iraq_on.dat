The group had already unsuccessfully attacked the Trebil checkpoint along the Jordanian border with Anbar Province in December 2004. In August, two US warships in Aqaba, the USS Kearsarge and the USS Ashland, were attacked with rockets; the cell which carried out the attacks then fled into <b>Iraq.</b> <b>On</b> 9 November, three Iraqis from Anbar carried out suicide bombings in Amman, killing 60.

5|$|In 1273, Isa led raids against Ilkhanid-held Anbar {{in western}} <b>Iraq</b> <b>on</b> orders from Baybars, {{possibly}} to divert Ilkhanid forces from an expedition against Syria.

Months later, in March 1274, Isa's forces confronted {{a group of}} Khafaja Bedouin in Anbar, {{though there was no}} conclusive victory after a daylong battle. Isa commanded a contingent of Baybars' army in the 1277 campaign against the Mongols at the Battle of Elbistan.

Turkey {{was reported to have}} used F-4 jets to attack PKK separatists and the ISIS capital on 19 September 2015. The Turkish Air Force has reportedly used the F-4E 2020s against the more recent Third Phase of the PKK conflict on heavy bombardment missions into <b>Iraq</b> <b>on</b> 15 November 2015, 12 January 2016, and 12 March 2016.|$|E
5|$|The New York Times {{supported}} the 2003 invasion of <b>Iraq.</b> <b>On</b> May 26, 2004, {{a year after}} the war started, the newspaper asserted that some of its articles had not been as rigorous as they should have been, and were insufficiently qualified, frequently overly dependent upon information from Iraqi exiles desiring regime change. Reporter Judith Miller retired after criticisms that her reporting of the lead-up to the Iraq War was factually inaccurate and overly favorable to the Bush administration's position, for which The New York Times later apologized. One of Miller's prime sources was Ahmed Chalabi, an Iraqi expatriate who returned to Iraq after the U.S. invasion and held a number of governmental positions culminating in acting oil minister and deputy prime minister from May 2005 until May 2006.|$|E

5|$|The United States {{military}} in Anbar Province {{had a series}} of reorganizations in late 2009 and early 2010. The last non-American foreign forces left <b>Iraq</b> <b>on</b> 31 July 2009 and Multi-National Forces West became United States Force– West. On 23 January 2010, the Marines formally left both Anbar Province and Iraq, transferring American military commitments over to the United States Army's 1st Armored Division. The Army promptly merged United States Division West with United States Division– Baghdad, creating United States Division– Center to advise Iraqi forces in both Anbar and Baghdad. In December 2010, the 25th Infantry Division assumed responsibility for Anbar Province. On 7 December, the United States transferred its last base in Anbar Province, Al Asad, to the Iraqi Government. One week later, hundreds of Fallujah residents celebrated the pullout by burning American flags in the city.|$|E
5|$|During a {{match with}} Mr. Kennedy on the October 1, 2007 episode of Raw, Cena {{suffered}} a legitimate torn pectoral muscle while executing a hip toss. Though finishing the match and {{taking part in}} the scripted attack by Orton after the match, surgery the following day found that his pectoralis major muscle was torn completely from the bone, estimating at the time to require seven months to a year of rehabilitation. As a result, Cena was stripped of the title by Mr. McMahon on the next night's episode of ECW, ending what was the longest WWE Championship reign in over 19 years. Cena's surgery was performed by orthopedic surgeon James Andrews at St. Vincent's Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama. Two weeks later in a video update on WWE.com, Dr. Andrews and Cena's physical trainer both said that he was several weeks ahead of where he was expected to be in his rehabilitation at that time. Despite his injury, Cena attended the annual WWE's Tribute to the Troops show filmed at Camp Speicher in Tikrit, <b>Iraq</b> <b>on</b> December 7, and aired on December 24.|$|E
5|$|In {{support of}} Operation Iraqi Freedom I, the 18th Military Police Brigade crossed into <b>Iraq</b> <b>on</b> 22 March 2003. During its year of deployment, the brigade {{established}} Prisoner of War holding areas for over 3,600 Iraqi prisoners and conducted main supply route patrolling over 2,500 kilometers in southern Iraq. The Brigade entered Baghdad in April 2003 and began establishing the new Iraqi Police Service and rebuilding Iraqi police stations. From {{the beginning of}} Operation Iraqi Freedom until February 2004 the Brigade provided command and control for seven Military Police battalions, one Mechanized Infantry battalion, 30 Military Police companies, and two Law and Order detachments. The Brigade’s MPs conducted over 24,000 combat patrols, apprehended over 2,400 criminals, confiscated 7,500 illegal weapons, and trained over 10,000 Iraqi police officers. During their deployment, the Brigade recovered several precious artifacts, such as the Mask of Warka, which was recovered on 23 September 2003. The brigade returned to Sandhofen in 2004 only to return to Iraq in 2007.|$|E

5|$|On 14September 2014, the Federal {{government}} {{committed to}} deploying {{up to eight}} Super Hornets of No.1 Squadron to Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates, {{as part of the}} Australian Air Task Group joining the coalition against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) forces in Iraq. Aircraft from the squadron conducted their first mission over <b>Iraq</b> <b>on</b> 5October, and their first strike four days later. According to the Department of Defence, as of 20December 2014 the Super Hornets had flown over 180 sorties, dropped 113 weapons, and destroyed 36 ISIL targets, damaging another six. In March 2015, having flown almost 3,000 hours in over 400 missions, the detachment was replaced by six F/A-18As from No.75 Squadron. A detachment of No.1 Squadron was again to deployed to Al Minhad as part of the Australian Air Task Group in May 2017, replacing the six legacy Hornets deployed prior.|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} {{received its}} fifth KC-30 on 3December 2012, and achieved {{initial operating capability}} in February 2013. It expected to reach final operating capability, with both boom and probe-and-drogue delivery systems, in 2014. On 14September that year, the Federal government committed to deploying one of the squadron's KC-30s to Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates, {{as part of a}} coalition to combat Islamic State forces in Iraq. The aircraft was only cleared for operations with the probe-and-drogue system, as by this stage the boom system was not ready. The KC-30 began flying missions in <b>Iraq</b> <b>on</b> 1October 2014. The first successful contact using the boom system (in concert with another RAAF KC-30) took place near Amberley on 13May 2015. In July, the Federal government announced the purchase of two more KC-30s for delivery in 2018, taking No.33 Squadron's fleet to seven aircraft; the airframes were to be ex-Qantas A330-200 passenger liners, converted by Airbus Defence and Space at Getafe, near Madrid. The KC-30 deployed to Iraq undertook the first operational use of the boom system in late October 2015, refuelling an RAAF E-7 Wedgetail. In March 2016, No.33 Squadron was awarded the Duke of Gloucester Cup as the RAAF's most proficient squadron of the previous year, as well as the RAAF Maintenance Trophy.|$|E
5|$|On 21 July 1933, {{more than}} 600 Assyrians, led by Malik Yaqu, {{crossed the border}} into Syria in hope of {{receiving}} asylum from the French Mandate of Syria. They were, however, disarmed and refused asylum, and were subsequently given light arms and sent back to <b>Iraq</b> <b>on</b> 4 August. They then decided to surrender themselves to the Iraqi Army. While crossing the Tigris in the Assyrian village of Dirabun, a clash erupted between the Assyrians and an Iraqi Army brigade. Despite the advantage of heavy artillery, the Iraqis were driven back to their military base in Dirabun. The Assyrians, convinced that the army had targeted them deliberately, attacked an army barracks with little success. They were driven back to Syria upon the arrival of Iraqi aeroplanes. The Iraqi Army lost 33 soldiers during the fighting while the Assyrian irregulars took fewer casualties. Historians do not agree on who started the clashes at the border. The British Administrative Inspector for Mosul, Lieutenant Colonel R. R. Stafford, wrote that the Assyrians {{had no intention of}} clashing with the Iraqis, while the Iraqi historian Khaldun Husry (son of the prominent Arab nationalist Sati' al-Husri) claims that it was Yaqu's men who provoked the army at Dirabun. Husry supported the propaganda rumours, which circulated in the Iraqi nationalist newspapers, of the Assyrians mutilating the bodies of the killed Iraqi soldiers. This further enraged the Iraqi public against the Assyrians.|$|E
