5|$|The {{game was}} the first to be {{released}} under the Octane Games brand. It received average reviews from critics upon release, with IGN's Gord Goble writing that his main issue with the game was that it was very short and lacked any lasting appeal. Shortly after the game's release, an update was made available that added support for dual-monitors, support for <b>editable</b> key configurations, and more destructible objects to the game.|$|E
25|$|Each element {{added to}} a My Map has an <b>editable</b> tag. This tag can contain text, rich text or HTML. Embeddable video and other content can be {{included}} within the HTML tag.|$|E
25|$|Under Germany's Standards and Architectures for eGovernment Applications 4.0 (SAGA 4.0), ODF {{recommended}} for <b>editable</b> text documents, a multi-stakeholder initiative that recommends and mandates standards {{to be used}} by the German federal government.|$|E
25|$|Wikipedia {{has also}} spawned several sister {{projects}}, {{which are also}} wikis run by the Wikimedia Foundation. These other Wikimedia projects include Wiktionary, a dictionary project launched in December 2002, Wikiquote, a collection of quotations created a week after Wikimedia launched, Wikibooks, a collection of collaboratively written free textbooks and annotated texts, Wikimedia Commons, a site devoted to free-knowledge multimedia, Wikinews, for citizen journalism, and Wikiversity, a project {{for the creation of}} free learning materials and the provision of online learning activities. Another sister project of Wikipedia, Wikispecies, is a catalogue of species. In 2012 Wikivoyage, an <b>editable</b> travel guide, and Wikidata, an <b>editable</b> knowledge base, launched.|$|E
25|$|Drawbars: Usually {{found only}} on {{high-end}} keyboards and workstation, this feature allows the performer to emulate digitally-modeled {{sounds of a}} tonewheel electronic organ (hence drawbar). It consists of nine <b>editable</b> virtual sliders that resemble the drawbars of a tonewheel organ, and features various effects such as rotary speaker, percussion, and tremolo. The setting can be saved to the keyboard's user memory or storage device.|$|E
25|$|Many {{graphics}} programs (such as Apple's Preview software) save PNGs {{with large}} amounts of metadata and color-correction data that are generally unnecessary for Web viewing. Unoptimized PNG files from Adobe Fireworks are also notorious for this since they contain options to make the image <b>editable</b> in supported editors. Also CorelDRAW (at least version 11) sometimes produces PNGs which cannot be opened by Internet Explorer (versions 6–8).|$|E
25|$|Adobe's Fireworks saves larger PNG files {{than many}} {{programs}} by default. This {{stems from the}} mechanics of its Save format: the images produced by Fireworks' save function include large, private chunks, containing complete layer and vector information. This allows further lossless editing. When saved with the Export option, Fireworks' PNGs are competitive with those produced by other image editors, but are no longer <b>editable</b> as anything but flattened bitmaps. Fireworks is unable to save size-optimized vector-editable PNGs.|$|E
25|$|Office 2007 {{includes}} {{new applications}} and server-side tools, including Microsoft Office Groove, a collaboration and communication suite for smaller businesses, which was originally developed by Groove Networks before being acquired by Microsoft in 2005. Also included is Office SharePoint Server 2007, a major revision to the server platform for Office applications, which supports Excel Services, a client-server architecture for supporting Excel workbooks that are shared {{in real time}} between multiple machines, and are also viewable and <b>editable</b> through a web page.|$|E
25|$|Optical {{character}} recognition (OCR) {{is preferable to}} rekeying for converting existing text that is already written down but not in machine-readable format (for example, a Linotype-composed book from the 1940s). In other words, to convert the text from an image to <b>editable</b> text (that is, a string of character codes), a person could re-type it, or a computer could look at the image and deduce what each character is. OCR technology has already reached an impressive state (for example, Google Book Search) and promises more for the future.|$|E
25|$|Other formats may be {{released}} as well when submitted by volunteers. The most common non-ASCII format is HTML, which allows markup and illustrations to be included. Some project members and users have requested more advanced formats, believing {{them to be}} much easier to read. But some formats that are not easily <b>editable,</b> such as PDF, are generally not considered {{to fit in with}} the goals of Project Gutenberg. Also Project Gutenberg has two options for master formats that can be submitted (from which all other files are generated): customized versions of the Text Encoding Initiative standard (since 2005) and reStructuredText (since 2011).|$|E
25|$|Virtual {{entities}} {{may contain}} and {{be controlled by}} assorted attributes, such as transform values (location, orientation, and scale) stored in an object's transformation matrix. Animation is the change of an attribute over time. Multiple methods of achieving animation exist; the rudimentary form {{is based on the}} creation and editing of keyframes, each storing a value at a given time, per attribute to be animated. The 2D/3D graphics software will change with each keyframe, creating an <b>editable</b> curve of a value mapped over time, in which results in animation. Other methods of animation include procedural and expression-based techniques: the former consolidates related elements of animated entities into sets of attributes, useful for creating particle effects and crowd simulations; the latter allows an evaluated result returned from a user-defined logical expression, coupled with mathematics, to automate animation in a predictable way (convenient for controlling bone behavior beyond what a hierarchy offers in skeletal system set up).|$|E
25|$|The {{database}} {{features of}} the HyperCard system {{are based on the}} storage of the state of all of the objects on the cards in the physical file representing the stack. The database did not exist as a separate system within the HyperCard stack; no database engine or similar construct exists. Instead, the state of any object in the system was considered to be live and <b>editable</b> at any time. From the HyperCard runtime's perspective, {{there was no difference between}} moving a text field on the card and typing into it, both operations simply changed the state of the target object within the stack. Such changes are immediately saved when complete, so typing into a field caused that text to be stored to the stack's physical file. The system operates in a largely stateless fashion, with no need to save during operation. This is in common with many database-oriented systems, although somewhat different from document-based applications.|$|E
500|$|Wasteland Angel was {{released}} on September 1, 2011, through online distribution networks: Steam, Impulse, GamersGate, Direct2Drive, and Amazon Download. In a press release for the game, Meridian4's Marketing Director Steve Milburn stated, [...] "Much like the Honey Badger, Wasteland Angel is also 'pretty badass' [...] " [...] and provided a hyperlink to a satirical YouTube video about the honey badger. The developers released a demo for the game on September 12 which included four stages with a boss fight. A September 2011 update for the game was also released which included support for dual-monitors, <b>editable</b> key configurations, and more destroyable objects available in the game.|$|E
500|$|After the Scientology {{organization}} {{tried to}} remove a promotional film of Scientology featuring celebrity member Tom Cruise from the Internet, a group of web-based activists known as [...] "Anonymous" [...] focused efforts against Scientology. Anonymous disrupted Scientology websites and spread anti-Scientologist materials online. In July 2008, Messenger Newspapers noted, [...] "A war between internet collective Anonymous and the Church of Scientology" [...] had been [...] "fought out largely on the battlefields of YouTube, Wikipedia and other websites", before emerging to become a movement with protests taking place in front of Scientology buildings. Known as Project Chanology, the movement was [...] "Organised from a Wikipedia-style website (<b>editable</b> by anyone) and through anonymous internet chat rooms". The New York Times noted that through its actions related to attempts to remove the Tom Cruise video from the Internet, the Church of Scientology became {{a victim of the}} Streisand effect [...] a phenomenon whereby attempts to suppress information on the Internet end up having the opposite impact.|$|E
500|$|Vig started doubting {{it could}} be done fully analog once the tapes for the first song recorded, [...] "Miss the Misery", started falling apart, but Grohl {{reassured}} him [...] "no, Butch, I don't want any computer in this house at all." [...] The producer said that during recording he [...] "had to force my brain to fire different synapses" [...] to remember {{how to deal with the}} analog equipment and the lack of a digital display. One of the habits Vig had to call back was editing using a razor blade—"I used to be able to do 20 edits in half an hour if need be. It took me about 20 minutes to do the first edit!"—a technique he employed for the first songs recorded. Eventually he gave up and decided to punch in and punch out tapes instead, as the process was time-consuming and a more <b>editable</b> tape sent to Vig from Smart Studios was mostly ruined by one of Grohl's daughters. While many recordings had inserts and some parts rerecorded, the only song that had to be redone from scratch was [...] "I Should Have Known", as Grohl felt Vig was [...] "trying to make this into a radio single" [...] when the singer wanted it [...] "to sound really raw and primal".|$|E
500|$|In the {{developmental}} transition from God of War III to Ascension, {{one of the}} graphics engineers, Cedric Perthuis, noted that {{the limits of the}} God of War III engine restricted artist creativity, so they [...] "tried to remove or push those limits as far as possible without losing any performance." [...] For example, the number of UV sets was increased to three per mesh. For a complex character model like Kratos, [...] "independent textures are needed for body parts unique to him, each wrapping around the head, torso and limbs - all of which form an <b>editable</b> 'UV set' when laid out flat." [...] Allowing more UV sets also made it possible to have a more natural look to the environment. Ascension was not as dramatic an advance in graphics over its predecessor as God of War III had been: [...] "From a graphics 'technical' perspective, to a large degree God of War: Ascension was more refinement on the graphics front" [...] said another graphics engineer, Ben Diamand, who focused on optimization during Ascensions development. The development team also added dynamic lighting, which allowed for development of the Life Cycle gameplay mechanic. Particle effects were also greatly improved from God of War III: [...] "the idea was to give artists more control to achieve better results with less particles" [...] said Perthuis.|$|E
500|$|After the game's release, id Software {{licensed}} {{the engine}} to other developers, like the Commander Keen engine before it, {{as part of a}} series of engine licensing deals that id has made throughout its history; games using the Wolfenstein 3D engine or derivatives of it include , the Capstone Software games [...] and Operation Body Count, as well as Super 3D Noah's Ark. Apogee intended to produce an expansion pack in 1993 titled Rise of the Triad: Wolfenstein 3D Part II, designed by Tom Hall using the Wolfenstein 3D engine, but during development the game was changed into a stand-alone title with an enhanced engine, Rise of the Triad. Additionally, Softdisk produced Catacomb Abyss using the prototype Wolfenstein 3D engine from Catacomb 3-D as part of the Catacomb Adventure Series trilogy of sequels. Although Wolfenstein 3D was not designed to be <b>editable</b> or modified, players developed character and level editors to create original alterations to the game's content. John Carmack and Romero, who had played numerous mods of other games, were delighted, and overrode any concerns about copyright issues by the others. The modding efforts of Wolfenstein players led id Software to explicitly design later titles like Doom and Quake to be easily modifiable by players, even including the map editing tools id Software used with the games. The source code for the original Wolfenstein 3D engine was released by id in 1995; when making the 2009 iOS port, Carmack used some of the enhancements to the engine made by fans after its release. The game's technical achievements also led to numerous imitators such as Ken's Labyrinth, Nitemare 3D, , Terminal Terror and The Fortress of Dr. Radiaki, among others.|$|E

2500|$|In September 2005, Erik Möller voiced {{concern that}} [...] "long term page {{protection}} is used excessively on the German Wikipedia": on 14 September 2005, 253 pages were fully protected (only <b>editable</b> by admins) {{for more than}} two weeks (compared to 138 in the English Wikipedia). This was the highest number of such blocks of all Wikipedias. , the German Wikipedia still had the highest percentage of semi-protected articles - 0.281% - among the ten largest Wikipedias (articles not <b>editable</b> by unsubscribed or recently subscribed users), but with respect to the fraction of fully protected articles (0.0261%) it actually ranks fourth, behind the Japanese, Portuguese and English Wikipedias.|$|E
2500|$|Never in {{the past}} there were many [...] "edit-yourself" [...] map tools and {{software}} available for non-specialist. Map blogs and self-publishing are common. In 2004, Steve Coast created OpenStreetMap, a collaborative project to create a free <b>editable</b> map of the world. The creation and growth of OpenStreetMap has been motivated by restrictions on use or availability of map information {{across much of the}} world, and the advent of inexpensive portable satellite navigation devices.|$|E
2500|$|As Floricic's {{family did}} not wish his full name (Boris Floricic) to be used, many German {{newspapers}} referred to him as [...] "Boris F." [...] On 14 December 2005, his parents obtained {{a temporary restraining order}} in a Berlin court against Wikimedia Foundation Inc. because its freely <b>editable</b> online encyclopedia, Wikipedia, mentioned the full name in its German language version. The order prohibited the Foundation from mentioning the full name on any website under the domain [...] "wikipedia.org". It furthermore required the Foundation to name a representative in Germany within two weeks following the decision.|$|E
2500|$|The license {{explicitly}} separates {{any kind}} of [...] "Document" [...] from [...] "Secondary Sections", {{which may not be}} integrated with the Document, but exist as front-matter materials or appendices. Secondary sections can contain information regarding the author's or publisher's relationship to the subject matter, but not any subject matter itself. While the Document itself is wholly <b>editable,</b> and is essentially covered by a license equivalent to (but mutually incompatible with) the GNU General Public License, some of the secondary sections have various restrictions designed primarily to deal with proper attribution to previous authors.|$|E
2500|$|SmartArt, {{found under}} the Insert tab in the ribbon in PowerPoint, Word, Excel, and Outlook, {{is a new}} group of <b>editable</b> and {{formatted}} diagrams. There are 115 preset SmartArt graphics layout templates in categories such as list, process, cycle, and hierarchy. When an instance of a SmartArt is inserted, a Text Pane appears next to it to guide the user through entering text in the hierarchical levels. Each SmartArt graphic, based on its design, maps the text outline, automatically resized for best fit, onto the graphic. There are a number of [...] "quick styles" [...] for each graphic that apply largely different 3D effects to the graphic, and the graphic's shapes and text can be formatted through shape styles and WordArt styles. In addition, SmartArt graphics change their colors, fonts, and effects to match the document's theme.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most notable}} visual and {{functional}} difference, however, came with Windows Explorer. The {{incorporation of the}} Plex theme made blue the dominant color of the entire application. The Windows XP-style task pane was almost completely replaced with a large horizontal pane that appeared under the toolbars. A new search interface allowed for filtering of results, searching of Windows help, and natural-language queries {{that would be used}} to integrate with WinFS. The animated search characters were also removed. The [...] "view modes" [...] were also replaced with a single slider that would resize the icons in real-time, in list, thumbnail, or details mode, depending on where the slider was. File metadata was also made more visible and more easily <b>editable,</b> with more active encouragement to fill out missing pieces of information. Also of note was the conversion of Windows Explorer to being a [...]NET application.|$|E
2500|$|Wikipedia {{began as}} a {{complementary}} project for Nupedia, a free online English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process. Nupedia was founded on March 9, 2000, under the ownership of Bomis, a web portal company. Its main figures were Jimmy Wales, the [...] of Bomis, and Larry Sanger, editor-in-chief for Nupedia and later Wikipedia. Nupedia was licensed initially under its own Nupedia Open Content License, switching to the GNU Free Documentation License before Wikipedia's founding {{at the urging of}} Richard Stallman. Sanger and Wales founded Wikipedia. While Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly <b>editable</b> encyclopedia, Sanger is credited with the strategy of using a wiki to reach that goal. On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a [...] "feeder" [...] project for Nupedia.|$|E
2500|$|Critics of {{publicly}} <b>editable</b> wiki systems {{argue that these}} systems could be easily tampered with by malicious individuals ("vandals") or even by well-meaning but unskilled users who introduce errors into the content. While proponents argue that the community of users can catch malicious content and correct it. Lars Aronsson, a data systems specialist, summarizes the controversy as follows: [...] "Most people, when they first learn about the wiki concept, assume that a Web site that can be edited by anybody would soon be rendered useless by destructive input. It sounds like offering free spray cans next to a grey concrete wall. The only likely outcome would be ugly graffiti and simple tagging, and many artistic efforts would not be long lived. Still, it seems to work very well." [...] High editorial standards in medicine and health sciences articles, in which users typically use peer-reviewed journals or university textbooks as sources, {{have led to the}} idea of expert-moderated wikis. Some wikis allow one to link to specific versions of articles, which has been useful to the scientific community, in that expert peer reviewers could analyse articles, improve them and provide links to the trusted version of that article. Noveck points out that [...] "participants are accredited by members of the wiki community, who {{have a vested interest in}} preserving the quality of the work product, on the basis of their ongoing participation." [...] On controversial topics that have been subject to disruptive editing, a wiki may restrict editing to registered users.|$|E
2500|$|Gary Marshall of TechRadar commented in 2016 that [...] "Where Office {{tries to}} do {{everything}} imaginable, Google's suite is much more basic. That said, it's much more powerful {{than it was when}} the package debuted in 2006, but the emphasis on simplicity and speed remains." [...] Marshall wrote that [...] "We wouldn't want to craft a massive, complicated manuscript in Docs, but then that isn't what Docs is designed to do. It's a fast and user-friendly way to create everyday documents and to share them with colleagues and clients", and that fellow service Google Sheets [...] "covers the most common Excel functions [...] but doesn't have the power of Microsoft's offering". Marshall praised collaboration for being [...] "effortless", and praised importing of external file formats and making those <b>editable</b> and collaborative for being a [...] "big selling point". PC Magazines Eric Grevstad wrote that [...] "what's online is what you get", adding that [...] "configuring them to [...] is a rigmarole". He stated that the package was [...] "an illustration of software's version of the 80/20 rule [...] 80 percent of users will never need more than 20 percent of the features". He stated that [...] "comparing [...] to Office 2016 is like bringing a handgun to a cannon fight [...] Microsoft's PC-based suite is designed to have almost every feature anyone might ever need; Google's online suite is designed to have most features most people use daily." [...] Tom's Hardwares James Gaskin wrote that [...] "like most Google products, it can claim the cleanest and most minimal interface in the market", and [...] "No other suite except Office 365 can get close to the ease of collaboration Google provides. And even Microsoft's product trails by a wide margin as changes only appear in real-time in Word 2016, not the other apps". Conclusively, he wrote: [...] "The progress made between the first Google App release and now has been considerable. As the world moves to more and more mobile computing, Google has a distinct advantage. But tradition dies hard, and those who build more than basic documents, spreadsheets, and presentations will remain tied to their desktops and laptops for the time being." ...|$|E
