5|$|Limousins {{have become}} popular {{because of their}} low birth weights (ease of calving), higher than average {{dressing}} percentage (ratio of carcase to live weight) and yield (ratio of meat to carcase), <b>high</b> <b>feed</b> conversion efficiency, {{and their ability to}} produce lean, tender meat. A major multi-breed study reported that Limousins converted feed into saleable meat more efficiently and significantly faster than popular British breeds, and marginally faster than other popular continental European cattle breeds. Conversely, the other cattle breeds produced proportionally more low-cost by-product and waste, which resulted in their live weight growth being faster than Limousins. Limousins are especially favoured for crossbreeding with cattle such as Angus, Hereford and Shorthorn because of their ability to contribute hybrid vigour, and improve the yield and feed conversion efficiency of these British breeds, which produce higher levels of fat and marbled meat.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide, more {{chickens}} {{are kept}} {{than any other}} type of poultry, with over 50 billion birds being raised each year as a source of meat and eggs. Traditionally, such birds would have been kept extensively in small flocks, foraging during the day and housed at night. This is still the case in developing countries, where the women often make important contributions to family livelihoods through keeping poultry. However, rising world populations and urbanization have led to the bulk of production being in larger, more intensive specialist units. These are often situated close to where the feed is grown or near to where the meat is needed, and result in cheap, safe food being made available for urban communities. Profitability of production depends very much on the price of feed, which has been rising. <b>High</b> <b>feed</b> costs could limit further development of poultry production.|$|E

2500|$|Holes {{through a}} PCB are {{typically}} drilled with small-diameter drill bits made of solid coated tungsten carbide. Coated tungsten carbide is recommended since many board materials are very abrasive and drilling must be high RPM and <b>high</b> <b>feed</b> to be cost effective. Drill bits must also remain sharp {{so as not}} to mar or tear the traces. Drilling with high-speed-steel is simply not feasible since the drill bits will dull quickly and thus tear the copper and ruin the boards.

50|$|Recent {{fundamental}} {{studies indicate}} that membrane fouling is influenced by numerous factors such as system hydrodynamics, operating conditions, membrane properties, and material property (solute). At low pressure, low feed concentration, and <b>high</b> <b>feed</b> velocity, concentration polarisation effects are minimal and flux is almost proportional to trans-membrane pressure difference. However, in the high pressure range, flux becomes almost independent of applied pressure. Deviation from linear flux-pressure relation is due to concentration polarisation.

The effects of the <b>high</b> <b>feeding</b> populations of GWSS on navel orange peel nutrient status and metabolism have been consistent for the four years of the study. <b>High</b> GWSS <b>feeding</b> populations significantly reduced peel Ca and Mg concentrations all years of the study: year 1 (P≤ 0. 05) and year 2 compared to the low GWSS population (P≤ 0. 001). <b>High</b> GWSS <b>feeding</b> populations significantly disrupted N metabolism causing high peel nitrate-N or total N in years 1 and 2, respectively (P≤ 0. 05). <b>High</b> GWSS <b>feeding</b> populations significantly increased peel arginine and putrescine concentrations in four years of the study with {{the magnitude of the}} difference between the two treatments greater in years 2 and 3 (P≤ 0. 05). <b>High</b> GWSS <b>feeding</b> populations resulted in a numerically higher concentration of proline in year 1 and a significantly higher proline concentration in year 2 (P≤ 0. 05).
