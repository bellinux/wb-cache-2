40|$|In angiostrongyliasis, chronic parasite-induced {{granuloma}} formation {{can lead}} to tissue destruction and fibrosis. Here, the histomorphology of <b>granulomatous</b> <b>fibrosis</b> and proteinase production in the lungs of Angiostrongylus cantonensis-infected Sprague-Dawley rats were investigated. The relationship between metalloproteinases and <b>granulomatous</b> <b>fibrosis</b> was investigated following infection of each rat with 60 infective larvae. Granulomata and fibrosis were marked in the lungs of rats on day 180 post-inoculation. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of lung mRNA showed an up-expression of proinflammatory cytokine including tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta). According to Western blot analysis, matrix metalloproteinase- 2 (MMP- 2) proenzyme was presented in the lungs of uninfected and infected rats, and partial conversion of 72 kDa proenzyme to the 64 kDa active form occurred in infected rats. In addition, increased protein levels of MMP- 9 and MMP- 13 were detected in infected lungs, but were undetectable in controls. The results suggest that TNF-alpha, IL- 1 beta, MMP- 2, - 9, and - 13 {{may be associated with}} the <b>granulomatous</b> <b>fibrosis...</b>|$|E

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND & AIMS: Cross-linking {{participates in}} the {{increased}} stability of collagen towards proteolytic degradation. Liver collagen cross-linking by pyridinoline, from the lysyl oxidase pathway, and by pentosidine, issued from glycation, was investigated to determine their respective contribution to collagen stabilization in patients with an irreversible liver fibrosis caused by the parasitic granulomatous disease alveolar echinococcosis. METHODS: Liver pyridinoline and pentosidine were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography, and urinary pyridinoline was analyzed by immunoassay. Cross-linked type I collagen was localized by immunohistochemistry with an antibody against the C-terminal part of the molecule, involved in pyridinoline formation, that was measured in serum by radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: In contrast to pyridinoline, pentosidine decreased in fibrotic lesions. Cross-linked I collagen was located predominantly in collagen bundles in the periparasitic granuloma. Serum pentosidine and urinary pyridinoline levels {{did not differ significantly}} from controls, but the serum concentration of the C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen increased significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Lysyl oxidase-mediated cross-linking is the major process contributing to the stabilization of collagen in <b>granulomatous</b> <b>fibrosis,</b> and glycation is not significantly involved in it. The changes induced by alveolar echinococcosis in liver collagen metabolism are associated with an increase in serum C-telopeptide of type I collagen.

40|$|Investigation of {{cellular}} uptake of metal compounds {{is important in}} understanding metal-related toxicity and diseases. Inhalation of beryllium aerosols can cause chronic beryllium disease, a progressive, <b>granulomatous</b> <b>fibrosis</b> of the lung. Studies in laboratory animals and cultured animal cells indicate that alveolar macrophages take up beryllium compounds and participate in a hypersensitivity immune response to a beryllium-containing antigen. In the present work, human monocyte cell line THP- 1 was induced with phorbol myristate acetate to differentiate into a macrophage. This cell with characteristics of human alveolar macrophages was employed to study cellular beryllium uptake and related biological effects. Morphological changes, phagocytosis of fluorescent latex beads, and cell surface CD 14 expression were used to verify the successful differentiation of THP- 1 monocytes into macrophages. An improved mass spectrometry method for quantitative analysis of intracellular beryllium {{as opposed to the}} traditional radioisotopic approach was developed using ICP-MS. The influence of the solubility of beryllium compounds, exposure duration, and beryllium concentration on the incorporation of beryllium was studied. Our data indicated that the uptake of particulate BeO was much more significant than that of soluble BeSO 4, suggesting the major cellular uptake pathway is phagocytosis. Nevertheless, subsequent DAPI nuclear staining and PARP cleavage study indicated that beryllium uptake had a negligible effect on the apoptosis of THP- 1 macrophages compared to the unstimulated macrophage control. Meanwhile, no substantial variation of tumour necrosis factor-alpha production was observed for THP- 1 macrophages upon beryllium exposure. These data imply alveolar macrophages could have some level of tolerance to beryllium and this may explain why most Be-exposed individuals remain healthy throughout life.

Despite the global impact of urogenital schistosomiasis, {{basic understanding of}} the associated pathologic mechanisms has been incomplete {{due to the lack}} of suitable animal models. We leveraged our recently developed mouse model of urogenital schistosomiasis to perform the first-ever profiling of the early molecular events that occur in the bladder in response to the introduction of S. haematobium eggs. Microarray analysis of bladders revealed rapid, differential transcription of large numbers of genes, peaking three weeks post-egg administration. Many differentially transcribed genes were related to the canonical Type 2 anti-schistosomal immune response, as reflected by the development of egg-based bladder granulomata. Numerous collagen and metalloproteinase genes were differentially transcribed over time, revealing complex remodeling and fibrosis of the bladder that was confirmed by Masson’s Trichrome staining. Multiple genes implicated in carcinogenesis pathways, including vascular endothelial growth factor-, oncogene-, and mammary tumor-related genes, were differentially transcribed in egg-injected bladders. Surprisingly, junctional adhesion molecule, claudin and uroplakin genes, key components for maintaining the urothelial barrier, were globally suppressed after bladder exposure to eggs.

40|$|Abstract. Pulmonary {{fibrosis}} was induced following inoculation of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis conidia intra-nasally in BALB/c mice.

40|$|Mice {{infected}} with 30 cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni developed portal and septal fibrosis {{due to the}} massive and concentrated deposition of eggs in the periportal areas which occurred following the 16 th week after infection. The lesion resembled pipe-stem fibrosis seen in human hepatosplenic schistosomiasis in the following characters: portal fibrosis interconnecting portal spaces as well as portal spaces and central canals; portal inflammation; periovular granulomas; vascular obstruction and telangiectasia. The liver parenchyma maintained its normal architecture. Vascular injection techniques with Indian ink and vinylite revealed that the portal system developed numerous dilated collateral venules coming from the large and medium-sized portal branches, about 10 weeks after schistosome infection. The lodging of schistosome eggs into these collaterals resulted in <b>granulomatous</b> inflammation and <b>fibrosis</b> along all the portal tracts, thus forming the pipe-stem lesion.

40|$|Background: Pilonidal disease occurs {{either as}} a {{secreting}} sinus or {{in the form of}} an acute abscess in the coccygeal area and is an underlying cyst associated with <b>granulomatous</b> and <b>fibrosis</b> tissue which commonly contains heaps of hair, for which inherited and acquisitive hypotheses are proposed. Body mass index (BMI) is the objective indicator of obesity according to height and weight. This study aims to examine the relationship between BMI and the role of obesity in development and relapse of pilonidal cyst disease. Materials and Methods: This retrospective cross-sectional study examined 126 patients with primary or recurrent pilonidal sinus within a year. A separate questionnaire was formed and recorded in the computer for each patient based on the disease type and body mass index. Results: One hundred out of 126 studied patients (79. 4 %) underwent primary Pilonidal Sinus surgery and 26 patients (20. 6) had recurrent Pilonidal sinus surgery. 36 patients (28. 6) were female and 90 patients (71. 4 %) were male. Among patients with recurrent Pilonidal sinus, 18 patients (69. 2 %) had BMI above 30 and 8 patients (30. 8 %) had BMI of 25 to 30 kg/m 2. The patients whose BMI was estimated to be 20 to 25 or less than 20 kg/ m 2 per square meter, had no recurrence of disease.

Episodic angioedema (Calabar swellings) {{in the arms}} and legs, caused by immune reactions are common. Calabar swellings are 3-10 cm in surface non erythematous and not pitting. When chronic, they can form cyst-like enlargements of the connective tissue around the sheaths of muscle tendons, becoming very painful when moved. The swellings may last for 1-3 days, and may be accompanied by localized urticaria (skin eruptions) and pruritus (itching). They reappear at referent locations at irregular time intervals.

40|$|AbstractRole of {{different}} mediators {{was described in}} the development of the <b>granulomatous</b> response and <b>fibrosis</b> observed in intestinal schistosomiasis. However, both Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR 2) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) have not yet been investigated in intestinal schistosomiasis. This study aimed to characterize the role of TLR 2 and NF-κB in the pathogenesis of intestinal schistosomiasis. Experimental animals were divided into two groups; group I: non-infected control group and group II: mice infected subcutaneously with S. mansoni cercariae. Colon samples were taken from infected mice, every two weeks, starting from the 6 th week postinfection (PI) till 18 th week PI. Samples were subjected to histopathological and immunohistochemical studies. Colon of S. mansoni infected mice showed histopathological changes in the form of mucosal degeneration, transmural mononuclear cellular infiltration and granulomas formation. Immunostained sections revealed significant increase in TLR 2 and NF-κB positive cells in all layers of the colon, cells of the granuloma and those of the lymphoid follicles 10 weeks PI. All these changes decreased gradually starting from 12 weeks PI onward to be localized focally at 18 weeks PI. In conclusion, recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells to the colonic mucosa in intestinal schistosomiasis are multifactorial events involving TLR 2 that can trigger the NF-κB pathways. Hence, down-regulation of both TLR 2 and NF-κB could be exploited in the treatment of colonic schistosomiasis...|$|R
40|$|Macrophage-specific {{expression}} of Arginase- 1 is commonly believed to promote inflammation, fibrosis, and wound healing by enhancing L-proline, polyamine, and Th 2 cytokine production. Here, however, {{we show that}} macrophage-specific Arg 1 functions as an inhibitor of inflammation and fibrosis following infection with the Th 2 -inducing pathogen Schistosoma mansoni. Although susceptibility to infection was not affected by the conditional deletion of Arg 1 in macrophages, Arg 1 (-/flox);LysMcre mice died at an accelerated rate. The mortality was not due to acute Th 1 /NOS 2 -mediated hepatotoxicity or endotoxemia. Instead, <b>granulomatous</b> inflammation, liver <b>fibrosis,</b> and portal hypertension increased in infected Arg 1 (-/flox);LysMcre mice. Similar findings were obtained with Arg 1 (flox/flox);Tie 2 cre mice, which delete Arg 1 in all macrophage populations. Production of Th 2 cytokines increased in the infected Arg 1 (-/flox);LysMcre mice, and unlike alternatively activated wild-type macrophages, Arg 1 (-/flox);LysMcre macrophages failed to inhibit T cell proliferation in vitro, providing an underlying mechanism for the exacerbated Th 2 pathology. The suppressive activity of Arg 1 -expressing macrophages was independent of IL- 10 and TGF-beta 1. However, when exogenous L-arginine was provided, T cell proliferation was restored, suggesting that Arg 1 -expressing macrophages deplete arginine, which is required to sustain CD 4 (+) T cell responses. These data identify Arg 1 as the essential suppressive mediator of alternatively activated macrophages (AAM) and demonstrate that Arg 1 -expressing macrophages function as suppressors rather than inducers of Th 2 -dependent inflammation and fibrosis...|$|R

After one year exposure, 42 µg/lung was found in animals exposed to 0. 1 mg/m³ and 2. 6 mg/lung in animals exposed to 3 mg/m³. Histological examination of lungs revealed several adverse and non-adverse effects in the lung. The non-adverse effects comprised accumulation of particle-laden macrophages in alveolar/interstitial areas and in the BALT, particle-laden syncytial giant cells in the BALT and bronchiolo-alveolar hyperplasia (alveolar bronchiolization). The adverse effects included (mixed) alveolar/interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration, alveolar/interstitial <b>granulomatous</b> inflammation, interstitial <b>fibrosis</b> and alveolar lipoproteinosis.

Whereas no organ-specific differences in the affinities of individual bile acids to hepatic and extrahepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferases were observed, the individual bile acids showed reaction rates in liver that were about twice the rates estimated in kidney and about twice to three times the rates observed in duodenal mucosa. In intestinal mucosa the rate of chenodeoxycholic acid glucuronidation exhibited a progressive decrease from duodenum to colon, where it was 30 % of the duodenal level. Comparison of the glucuronidation rates that were estimated with different bile acids in hepatic or extrahepatic tissues showed that for each organ a bile acid structure-activity relationship existed, with highest activity observed for lithocholic and ursodeoxycholic acids, which was about twofold higher compared with chenodeoxycholic or deoxycholic acids.

40|$|AbstractHermansky–Pudlak {{syndrome}} (HPS) is a {{group of}} rare autosomal recessive disorders characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, a bleeding tendency, and sporadic pulmonary <b>fibrosis,</b> <b>granulomatous</b> colitis or infections. Nine HPS-causing genes have been identified in humans. HPS- 1 is the most severe subtype with a prevalence of ~ 1 / 1800 in northwest Puerto Rico due to a founder mutation in the HPS 1 gene. Mutations in HPS genes affect the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles such as melanosomes in melanocytes and platelet dense granules. Two of these genes (HPS 1 and HPS 4) encode the HPS 1 and HPS 4 proteins, which assemble to form a complex known as Biogenesis of Lysosome-related Organelle Complex 3 (BLOC- 3). We report the identification of the interacting regions in HPS 1 and HPS 4 required for the formation of this complex. Two regions in HPS 1, spanning amino acids 1 – 249 and 506 – 700 are required for binding to HPS 4; the middle portion of HPS 1 (residues 250 – 505) is not required for this interaction. Further interaction studies showed that the N-termini of HPS 1 and HPS 4 interact with each other and that a discrete region of HPS 4 (residues 340 – 528) interacts with both the N- and C-termini of the HPS 1 protein. Several missense mutations found in HPS- 1 patients did not affect interaction with HPS 4, but some mutations involving regions interacting with HPS 4 caused instability of HPS 1. These observations extend our understanding of BLOC- 3 assembly and represent an important first step in the identification of domains responsible for the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles...|$|R
40|$|Retnla (Resistin-like {{molecule}} alpha/FIZZ 1) is induced during Th 2 cytokine immune responses. However, {{the role}} of Retnla in Th 2 -type immunity is unknown. Here, using Retnla(-/-) mice and three distinct helminth models, we show that Retnla functions as a negative regulator of Th 2 responses. Pulmonary granuloma formation induced by the eggs of the helminth parasite Schistosoma mansoni is dependent on IL- 4 and IL- 13 and associated with marked increases in Retnla expression. We found that both primary and secondary pulmonary granuloma formation were exacerbated {{in the absence of}} Retlna. The number of granuloma-associated eosinophils and serum IgE titers were also enhanced. Moreover, when chronically infected with S. mansoni cercariae, Retnla(-/-) mice displayed significant increases in granulomatous inflammation in the liver and the development of fibrosis and progression to hepatosplenic disease was markedly augmented. Finally, Retnla(-/-) mice infected with the gastrointestinal (GI) parasite Nippostrongylus brasiliensis had intensified lung pathology to migrating larvae, reduced fecundity, and accelerated expulsion of adult worms from the intestine, suggesting Th 2 immunity was enhanced. When their immune responses were compared, helminth infected Retnla(-/-) mice developed stronger Th 2 responses, which could be reversed by exogenous rRelmalpha treatment. Studies with several cytokine knockout mice showed that expression of Retnla was dependent on IL- 4 and IL- 13 and inhibited by IFN-gamma, while tissue localization and cell isolation experiments indicated that eosinophils and epithelial cells were the primary producers of Retnla in the liver and lung, respectively. Thus, the Th 2 -inducible gene Retnla suppresses resistance to GI nematode infection, pulmonary <b>granulomatous</b> inflammation, and <b>fibrosis</b> by negatively regulating Th 2 -dependent responses...|$|R

SEA-stimulated bulk mesenteric lymph node cells or CD 4 T cells from 7 -week-infected WSX- 1 −/− mice produced significantly less IFN-γ than did those from C 57 BL/ 6 mice, even though {{there was no difference between}} these mice in exacerbated hepatic egg-induced granulomatous inflammation or in the levels of IL- 17 induced by immunization with SEA/CFA. A fraction of the cells in the granulomas stained positive for IL- 27, but there were no significant differences between WSX- 1 −/− and BL/ 6 mice, nor were there differences in the number of CD 4 T cells and eosinophils. A 24 -week chronic infection resulted in markedly reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including IFN-γ, in WSX- 1 −/− mice, but again the magnitude of immunopathology was not significantly different between the two groups. These findings indicate that despite the impaired IFN-γ production, IL- 27 signaling has no significant effect on either the magnitude of egg-induced immunopathology or on its closest in vitro correlate, IL- 17...|$|R
40|$|Schistosomiasis {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{debilitating}} tropical diseases with the potential to cause morbidity and mortality in infected populations unless well controlled. Current control measures are limited to treatment with praziquantel. A rather alarming situation given i) the inability of the drug to directly target the pathogenic eggs, ii) the emergence of praziquantel-resistant schistosomes, iii) the persistence of tissue fibro-proliferative destruction caused by the trapped parasite eggs, even after treatment. Intestinal and liver immunopathology are pathognomonic of schistosomiasis and generally result from the host inadequate Th 2 and or Th 17 responses to the egg-derived antigens. Failure to control these immune responses causes the most of the detriment to the infected host, highlighting the need for a better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms which might help prevent excessive immune responsiveness and the ensuing immunopathology. A Basic leucine zipper transcription factor ATF-like 2 (BATF 2) which belongs to a family of transcription factors critical in the control of inflammatory responses has gained enormous momentum recently as a potential target to immune deregulation during cancer and infectious diseases. We reasoned that an eventual BATF 2 influence on the host immune response during schistosomiasis might unveil its anti-disease potency and greatly facilitate the quest for a novel control strategy against the immunopathology during schistosomiasis. Addressing this in our present study, BATF 2 -deficient mice were used and characterized for immunological and physiological parameters during steady state and Schistosomiasis. Although the liver showed a reduced pro-fibrotic response, there was a notable increase of several pro-fibrotic cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-ƴ, TGF-β and IL- 13) Which further translated into an elevated level of <b>granulomatous</b> inflammation and <b>fibrosis</b> in the gut of S. mansoni infected BATF- 2 -deficient mice when compared to the liver tissues of BATF 2 -deficient mice and both livers and intestines of infected littermate controls indicating that BATF 2 appears to have a tissue-specific role on the regulation of fibrogranulomatous inflammation during schistosomiasis. Therefore, BATF 2 has a critical, and hitherto unappreciated, role in mediating the regulation of gut fibrogranulomatous response so as to promote host survival during schistosomiasis...|$|R
40|$|Schistosomiasis mansoni, a {{tropical}} helminthic disease, {{is caused by}} disseminated worm eggs that induce CD 4 + T-cell mediated <b>granulomatous</b> inflammation and <b>fibrosis.</b> T suppressor cell activity has been proposed {{as one of the}} mechanisms active in the down-modulation of the murine disease during the chronic stage (16 – 20 weeks of the infection). In recent years a new category of the CD 4 + CD 25 + T regulatory (Treg) lymphocyte has been identified that maintains immune tolerance to self, and also functions in the regulation of parasite-induced immunopathology. The Foxp 3 gene which encodes the transcription factor Scurfin was found to be expressed by and required for the generation of CD 4 + CD 25 + T reg. At 8 weeks of the infection Foxp 3 gene expression of splenocytes was similar to that of naïve mice, but increased fourfold by 16 weeks. In contrast, granulomatous livers at 8 and 16 weeks showed 10 - and 30 -fold increases, respectively, in gene expression compared with normal liver. The percentage of granuloma CD 4 + CD 25 + T cells rose from 12 % at 8 weeks to 88 % at 16 weeks of the infection. Foxp 3 expression was 3 · 5 -fold higher in the CD 4 + CD 25 + versus the CD 4 + CD 25 − T cells in the 8 week infection granulomas. As a novel observation neuropilin- 1 membrane expression, a recently identified marker for Treg, was correlated with Foxp 3 expression in the granuloma CD 4 + CD 25 + but not the CD 25 − cells. Co-incubation with polyclonal stimulation of CD 4 + CD 25 + splenic cells with CD 4 + CD 25 − cells suppressed proliferation of the latter. Retroviral transfer of the Foxp 3 gene at the onset of granuloma formation enhanced fourfold Foxp 3 expression in the granuloma CD 4 + CD 25 + T cells and strongly suppressed full granuloma development. Gene transfer also significantly enhanced transforming growth factor-β, interferon-γ and interleukin- 4 but not interleukin- 10 expression. It is concluded, that CD 4 + CD 25 +, Foxp 3 + Treg cells also regulate schistosome egg-induced immunopathology...|$|R
40|$|Schistosomiasis {{caused by}} the {{parasitic}} helminth Schistosoma mansoni is a major health problem in tropical and subtropical regions. Its detection is crucial for patient management, evaluation of treatment, and monitoring of disease transmission, thus the development of novel diagnostic assays is of immense importance. The pathology of S. mansoni infection is characterised by formation of <b>granulomatous</b> lesions, hepatic <b>fibrosis</b> and portal hypertension. Liver fibrosis itself, regardless of the causative agent is an important health problem. The {{fact that there is}} no treatment for hepatic fibrosis other than transplantation in end stage liver failure emphasizes the importance of investigating the molecular basis of fibrogenesis and development of better therapeutic tools. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short non-coding RNA that play important roles in disease processes in animals. Several miRNAs have been implicated in hepatic fibrogenesis; however, the expression profile and the role of miRNAs in S. mansoni infection are yet to be determined. This thesis focuses on the characterization of miRNAs in the liver and serum of mice during S. mansoni infection in order to determine their therapeutic and diagnostic potential in this disease. Profiling of miRNA expression in the liver of mice infected with S. mansoni revealed a set of mouse miRNAs that were differentially expressed in infected compared to naïve mice including miR- 199 a- 3 p, miR- 199 a- 5 p, miR- 214 and miR- 21, which have previously been associated with liver fibrosis in other settings. Further, inhibition of one of the up-regulated miRNAs, miR- 199 a- 3 p, in the liver upon S. mansoni infection resulted in reduced levels of collagen and other fibrosis related genes. Our results are consistent with a model where miRNA inhibition influences the clearance or reversion of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) from a “myofibroblast-like” to an inactivated state. Thus, these results suggest miR- 199 a- 3 p inhibitor as potential therapeutic in treatment of liver fibrosis. miRNAs {{have been shown to be}} altered in disease process and are present in body fluids in a stable form, indicating that they can be used as novel diagnostic biomarkers. Studies of miRNAs in the circulation revealed that 5 of the mouse miRNAs altered in the liver were also significantly elevated in serum by 12 weeks post-infection. Sequencing of small RNAs from serum confirmed the presence of these miRNAs and further revealed 11 parasite-derived miRNAs that were detectable by 8 weeks post infection. Analysis of host and parasite miRNA abundance by qRTPCR was extended to the serum of patients from low- and high-infection sites in Zimbabwe and Uganda. The host-derived miRNAs failed to distinguish uninfected from infected individuals. However, analysis of three of the parasite-derived miRNAs (miR- 277, miR- 3479 - 3 p and bantam) could detect infected individuals from low- and high-infection intensity sites with specificity/sensitivity values of 89...|$|R
40|$|Schistosomiasis japonica is a zoonotic, {{parasitic}} disease {{caused by the}} trematode Schistosoma japonicum, with Oncomelania snails serving as the intermediate hosts. Schistosomiasis japonica is endemic in China, the Philippines, and Indonesia and is a major public health problem. The inflammatory response to the schistosome eggs in host tissues leads to formation of perioval granulomas, especially in the liver and intestine. In the liver, this eventually results in chronic portal fibrosis referred to as pipe-stem fibrosis. The pig has many biological similarities with man and is also a natural host for S. japonicum, {{which has led to}} exploration of this species as a large animal model of human schistosomiasis japonica. In pigs, there is marked portal and septal fibrosis of the liver in the early stage of patent infection, whereafter the fibrosis gradually resolves due to spontaneous recovery from the infection. The pig can thus serve as a model of the development and regression of schistosomal liver fibrosis. In the present study, twenty-six pigs were divided into six groups, A to F. Groups A to D (n = 5 /group) were infected with Schistosoma japonicum cercariae and groups E and F (n = 3 /group) served as uninfected controls. The degree of fibrosis was assessed at 3 different time-points upto 21 weeks after a single infection and after a primary infection followed by a challenge infection, using semi-quantitative histopathological scores as well as quantitative image analysis on liver sections and the two methods were compared. A possible correlation between fibrosis and liver tissue egg counts (TEC) was investigated and the fibrotic lesion was characterised by immunohistochemical detection of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), desmin and collagen type- 1. Major histopathological lesions were egg granulomas, diffuse portal and septal inflammatory cell infiltration, and <b>fibrosis.</b> <b>Granulomatous</b> obstruction of portal veins was common. The degree of fibrosis varied from mild to marked in all four groups of infected pigs and {{there were no significant differences}} in liver fibrosis scores or area of fibrosis between the groups. The measurement of the area of fibrosis by image analysis was found to be well correlated with the semi-quantitative histopathological scores for total fibrosis i. e. the sum of portal and septal fibrosis scores, as well as for portal and septal fibrosis respectively. There was a positive correlation between liver tissue egg counts (TEC) and septal and total fibrosis scores as well as the area of fibrosis. Expression of α-SMA was detected in connective tissue cells in portal and septal areas of normal and infected livers, but the numbers were increased proportionally to increases of the degree of fibrosis in infected pigs. Similar expression was observed in thickened portal veins of infected pigs and in hepatic stellate cells (HSC), smooth muscle cells of vessel walls, pericytes, and sub-epithelial cells of bile ducts of all pigs. Desmin expression was detected in HSC and in smooth muscle cells of portal veins, hepatic arteries and bile ducts in both normal and infected pigs. In areas with portal vein destruction, scattered desminpositive cells identified as smooth muscle cells were often found. Collagen type- 1 was present in increased amounts in portal and septal areas in infected pigs. In granulomas, there was a peripheral network of α-SMA-positive flattened, fibroblast-like cells and concentric collagen type- 1 -positive fibres, whereas desmin-positive cells were not observed. In conclusion, this study demonstrated a correlation between liver fibrosis and liver TEC. Good correlation was also found between the area of fibrosis as measured by image analysis and the semi-quantitative histopathological scores, making image analysis a useful additional tool for assessment of liver fibrosis in the pig model. In fibrotic portal and septal areas α-SMA-expressing connective tissue cells and collagen type- 1 were increased. Collagen type- 1 and α-SMA, but not desmin, were also detected in granulomas. Desmin could be used as a marker of portal vein destruction...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{tapeworms}} {{and their}} eggs are {{a risk to}} humans from dog feces thus the role of human excreta or sewage is generally not of concern. However due to the association with animals, particular dog excreta is an issue regarding hygiene and soil contamination where dogs are infected. The larval stages (metacestodes) of the helminth cestodes of the genus Echinococcus are the causes of echinococcoses. Until recently, the main two species recognized to cause diseases in humans were respectively E. granulosus, for ‘cystic echinococcosis’ (CE, formerly named ‘hydatidosis’, or ‘hydatid disease’ or ‘hydatid cyst’), and E. multilocularis, for alveolar echinococcosis (AE). The estimated minimum global human burden of human CE averages 285, 500 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) (more than 1 million if underreporting is taken into account), and AE, a rare but more severe disease, results in a median of 666, 434 DALYs per year. At {{the beginning of the}} 21 st century, based on genetic characteristics, E. granulosus sensu lato has been split into several species: E. granulosus sensu stricto (ex-sheep strain), E. felidis, E. equinus (ex-horse strain), E. ortleppi (ex-cattle strain), and E. canadensis (ex-camel, pig and cervid strains). E. oligarthrus and E. vogeli (only present in South America) cause diseases with a clinical presentation similar to that of CE and AE, respectively. The metacestodes consist of the germinal layer surrounded by the laminated layer. The germinal layer forms ‘buds’, then ‘vesicles’ (cysts), which are filled with a water-like liquid (‘hydatid/cyst/vesicle fluid’). Cysts may be single with little inflammatory reaction (typically for CE) or multiple and aggregated with an impressive <b>granulomatous</b> infiltrate, dense <b>fibrosis,</b> and necrosis of the central part of lesion (typically for AE). Both CE and AE are tumor-like diseases, most often located in the liver and also lungs for CE; dissemination may occur in any other organ/tissue. Echinococcosis may remain asymptomatic {{for a long period of}} time and spontaneous death of the metacestode occurs in many patients. Diagnosis relies on imaging, and incidental finding of an echinococcal lesion, especially in the liver, is not rare. Ultrasound (US) examination is the basis for diagnosis in patients with liver-related signs and symptoms and for mass screening. For CE, drug treatment includes 3 - 6 month albendazole for small cysts or, at the opposite of the spectrum, long-term albendazole (> 6 months) for disseminated non-operable CE. However, surgery remains the treatment of choice for most cysts. For AE, albendazole is the basis for care management in all patients, for a minimum of 2 years after radical surgical resection of the liver lesions; it must be administered for life, at least for decades, in all other cases; biliary complications and bacterial superinfection are treated by percutaneous or perendoscopic drainage and stenting. Infection of humans occurs through ingestion of Echinococcus eggs, excreted in the feces of definitive hosts. E. granulosus sensu lato is usually maintained by the domestic cycle (dog/domestic ungulates) and represents a persistent zoonosis in rural livestock-raising areas where humans cohabit with dogs fed on raw livestock offal in which the cysts are present. A cycle in wild animals allows E. multilocularis to occur in nature. It includes mostly voles of a number of different species and additionally lagormophs such as pikas in some areas, as intermediate hosts. Foxes, wolves and dogs are definitive hosts, and less commonly other carnivores. Environmental factors play a critical role in E. multilocularis infection in wild animals, resulting in a heterogeneous geographical distribution of the parasite and possibly influencing contamination of water. In many countries, dog and fox urbanization has considerably increased the human population at risk. Various types of association of CE and AE with water sources of the communities have been reported. Studies on the presence of infective eggs in the environment (including soil and plants/fruit/vegetables), using molecular tools, are just at their beginning. There are currently no published data on the presence of Echinococcus spp. eggs in sewage, sludge, surface waters, ground water, drinking water, soil or irrigation water. Echinococcus spp. eggs shed with carnivore feces are destroyed by heat (including water boiling) and desiccation but are very resistant to low temperature (until - 70 ° C) and to all chemicals used for disinfection; they may be released into and are well preserved in water; they may also be dispersed in the soil through spreading of sludge from water treatment plants. Systematic studies on how various modalities of sewage treatment and sanitation may contribute to or conversely avoid human infection are needed...|$|R
