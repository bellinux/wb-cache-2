50|$|Payara Server {{is derived}} from the {{upstream}} <b>GlassFish</b> source tree with Payara’s own enhancements and fixes. Development of Payara Server is independent from Oracle’s development of <b>GlassFish,</b> and Payara Server releases are always based on the most recent version of <b>GlassFish.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 10 December 2009 <b>GlassFish</b> 3.0 (a.k.a. Sun <b>GlassFish</b> Enterprise Server 3.0) was released. Being the Java EE {{reference}} implementation, {{this was}} the first application server to completely implement Java EE 6 JSR 316. JSR 316 was however approved with reservations. In this version <b>GlassFish</b> adds new features to ease migration from Tomcat to <b>GlassFish.</b> The other main new features are around modularity (<b>GlassFish</b> v3 Prelude already shipped with an Apache Felix OSGi runtime), startup time (a few seconds), deploy-on-change (provided by NetBeans and Eclipse plugins), and session preservation across redeployments.|$|R
50|$|Open-source <b>GlassFish</b> {{is planned}} to {{continue}} {{at least through}} version 5, and the Java EE 8 Reference Implementation will be derived from <b>GlassFish</b> Server Open Source Edition 5. This replicates {{what has been done}} in past Java EE and <b>GlassFish</b> Server releases.|$|R
50|$|This genus {{includes}} fish known commonly as glassies, perchlets, {{and common}} <b>glassfishes.</b> The genus name {{was derived from}} the Greek anabasis, meaning 'climbing up'.|$|E
50|$|Pseudambassis roberti is {{a species}} of fish in the family Ambassidae, the Asiatic <b>glassfishes.</b> It is sole species in the genus. It is endemic to Burma.|$|E
5000|$|Ambassis is a genus {{of fish in}} {{the family}} Ambassidae, the Asiatic <b>glassfishes.</b> They are found widely in the Indo-Pacific region, with species in fresh, {{brackish}} and coastal marine waters.|$|E
50|$|Formerly {{classified}} as Chanda ranga, {{the species is}} also known as the Indian <b>glassfish,</b> Indian glass perch, and Siamese <b>glassfish.</b>|$|R
50|$|Payara Server is an {{open-source}} {{application server}} derived from <b>GlassFish</b> Server Open Source Edition. It {{was created in}} 2014 by C2B2 Consulting as a drop in replacement for <b>GlassFish</b> after Oracle announced it was discontinuing commercial support for <b>GlassFish.</b> By comparison to <b>GlassFish,</b> Payara Server is released more frequently on a quarterly basis with added bug fixes, patches and enhancements. Since April 2016 Payara Server is sponsored by Payara Services Ltd {{who are responsible for}} ongoing development and coordinating community contributions.|$|R
50|$|<b>GlassFish</b> is an {{open-source}} {{application server}} project started by Sun Microsystems for the Java EE platform and now sponsored by Oracle Corporation. The supported version is called Oracle <b>GlassFish</b> Server. <b>GlassFish</b> is free software, dual-licensed under two free software licences: the Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL) and the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the classpath exception.|$|R
50|$|The Asiatic <b>glassfishes</b> are a family, Ambassidae, of {{freshwater}} and marine fishes {{in the order}} Perciformes. The species in the family are native to Asia, Oceania, the Indian Ocean, and the western Pacific Oceans. The family includes eight genera and about 49 species.|$|E
50|$|Paradoxodacna piratica is {{a species}} of fish in the family Ambassidae, the Asiatic <b>glassfishes.</b> It was {{described}} in 1989 {{and placed in a}} new monotypic genus of its own, Paradoxodacna. It is native to Indonesia, where it occurs in Sumatra and southern and western Borneo.|$|E

50|$|On 8 May 2007 Project SailFin was {{announced}} at JavaOne as a sub-project under Project <b>GlassFish.</b> Project SailFin aims to add Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) servlet functionality to <b>GlassFish.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 4 November 2013, Oracle {{announced}} the future roadmap for Java EE and <b>Glassfish</b> Server, with a 4.1 open-source edition planned and continuing open-sources updates to <b>GlassFish</b> {{but with an}} end to commercial Oracle support. Commercial customers will instead be encouraged to transition to Oracle's alternative product, Oracle WebLogic Server. The only fork of <b>Glassfish</b> currently available with commercial support is Payara Server.|$|R
5000|$|On 28 July 2011, Oracle Corporation {{released}} <b>GlassFish</b> 3.1.1. This is fix {{release for}} <b>GlassFish</b> 3.1 with multiple component updates (Weld, Mojarra, Jersey, EclipseLink, ...), JDK 7 support, AIX support and more.|$|R
40|$|India is {{blessed with}} a rich {{diversity}} of freshwater fishes both in the Western Ghats and North Eastern Hills. The Western Ghats of India {{is one of the}} 34 - biodiversity ‘hotspot’ areas of the world. The rate of endemism is well reflected in the case of lower vertebrates especially with regard to fishes. Of the 300 species of freshwater fishes in the Western Ghats, 155 are considered ornamental fishes, of which 117 are endemic to the Western Ghats (Gopalakrishnan & Ponniah, 2000). At present, {{only a small fraction of}} the endemic fish diversity is utilized in ornamental fish trade. All the ornamental fishes marketed in India are exotic. Eventhough there are quite a lot of indigenous fishes, having high potential as ornamental fishes, they have not been properly exploited. The fish fauna of the Western Ghats include variety of barbs, rasboras, killifishes, <b>glassfishes,</b> catfishes, catopra, hill trouts, and danios, which are ideal candidates for ornamental fish industry. They are exceptionally beautiful with a wide variety of bands, blotches, spots, and colourful fins on their body. In spite of the fact that the Western Ghats of India is a gold mine of endemic freshwater fishes suitable for the ornamental fish trade, no concerted efforts have so far been undertaken for the development of sustainable market for these resources. Lack of scientific information on these native aquatic fauna is the main reason for the poor performance of this sector...|$|E

50|$|Ambassis marianus, {{commonly}} known as the estuary perchlet, Ramsay's <b>glassfish,</b> estuary <b>glassfish</b> or glass perchlet, is a species of fish in the family Ambassidae. It is native to coastal eastern Australia. It gains its common name from its transparent appearance.|$|R
50|$|The commercially {{supported}} {{version of}} <b>GlassFish</b> {{is known as}} Oracle <b>GlassFish</b> Server, formerly Sun <b>GlassFish</b> Enterprise Server, and previously Sun Java System Application Server (SJSAS) has a history, along with other iPlanet software, going back to Netscape Application Server. This includes code from other companies such as Oracle Corporation for TopLink Essentials. Ericssons SIP Servlet support is included, the opensource version of it is SailFish, developing towards JSR-289. In 2010, {{the difference between the}} commercial and open source edition was already quite small.|$|R
50|$|A {{total of}} 16 {{species of fish}} {{are found in the}} river including; the <b>Glassfish,</b> Macleay's <b>Glassfish,</b> Fork talked catfish, Fly-specked Hardyhead, Mouth Almighty, Spangled Perch, Barramundi, Oxeye Herring, Rainbowfish, Exquisite Rainbowfish, Northern Trout Gudgeon, Bony Bream, Catfish, Bony Bream and the Seven-spot Archerfish.|$|R
40|$|Saltmarsh-dwelling grapsid crabs release free-swimming larvae (i. e. zoeae) into ebbing tides during spring-tide cycles that inundate saltmarshes, where initial {{inundation}} is a cue for larval {{release on}} subsequent inundations. In a saltmarsh environment, crab zoeae {{are the main}} food for fish (including the <b>glassfish,</b> Ambassis jacksoniensis), which 'fast' at other times. This saltmarsh-feeding model was tested by obtaining <b>glassfish</b> from near saltmarshes in a reasonably unmodified tributary of a large temperate estuary on flood and ebb tides during the night in two spring-tide events in austral autumn of 2009. <b>Glassfish</b> fed only on ebbing tides, with stomachs being similarly full on both spring-tide events. Thalassinid larvae (including Trypaea australiensis) dominated the dietary volumes, especially {{on the night before}} saltmarsh inundation, presumably being released during inundation of intertidal mud and sand habitats. Although <b>glassfish</b> progressively 'switched' to feeding on greater volumes of crab zoeae (presumably released after inundation of a saltmarsh) over both spring-tide cycles, such zoeal contributions never exceeded those of thalassinid larvae. The above differences highlight that, although ebb tides trigger feeding by <b>glassfish,</b> this ambassid focuses on different prey in a reasonably unmodified environment. The ability of <b>glassfish</b> to switch prey, and thus accommodate environmental differences, helps explain their high abundance in estuaries of this region...|$|R
