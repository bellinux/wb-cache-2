5|$|Optical {{heterodyne}} detection {{is an essential}} technique used in high-accuracy measurements of the frequencies of optical sources, {{as well as in}} the stabilization of their frequencies. Until a relatively few years ago, lengthy <b>frequency</b> chains were needed to connect the microwave <b>frequency</b> of a cesium or other atomic time source to optical frequencies. At each step of the chain, a <b>frequency</b> multiplier would be used to produce a harmonic of the <b>frequency</b> of that step, which would be compared by {{heterodyne detection}} with the next step (the output of a microwave source, far infrared laser, infrared laser, or visible laser). Each measurement of a single spectral line required several years of effort in the construction of a custom <b>frequency</b> chain. Currently, optical <b>frequency</b> combs have provided a much simpler method of measuring optical frequencies. If a mode-locked laser is modulated to form a train of pulses, its spectrum is seen to consist of the carrier <b>frequency</b> surrounded by a closely spaced comb of optical sideband frequencies with a spacing equal to the pulse repetition <b>frequency</b> (Fig.16). The pulse repetition <b>frequency</b> is locked to that of the <b>frequency</b> standard, and the frequencies of the comb elements at the red end of the spectrum are doubled and heterodyned with the frequencies of the comb elements at the blue end of the spectrum, thus allowing the comb to serve as its own reference. In this manner, locking of the <b>frequency</b> comb output to an atomic standard can be performed in a single step. To measure an unknown <b>frequency,</b> the <b>frequency</b> comb output is dispersed into a spectrum. The unknown <b>frequency</b> is overlapped with the appropriate spectral segment of the comb and the <b>frequency</b> of the resultant heterodyne beats is measured.|$|E

5|$|<b>Frequency</b> scaling was the {{dominant}} reason for improvements in computer performance from the mid-1980s until 2004. The runtime {{of a program}} {{is equal to the}} number of instructions multiplied by the average time per instruction.

40|$|The use of {{multiple}} <b>frequencies</b> in a nonlinear microwave algorithm is considered. Using multiple <b>frequencies</b> allows for obtaining the improved resolution available at the higher <b>frequencies</b> while retaining the regularizing effects of the lower <b>frequencies.</b> However, {{a number of different}} challenges arise when using data from multiple <b>frequencies</b> for imaging of biological targets. In this paper, the performance of a multi-frequency algorithm, in which measurement data from several different <b>frequencies</b> are used at once, is compared with a stepped-frequency algorithm, in which images reconstructed at lower <b>frequencies</b> are used as starting guesses for reconstructions at higher <b>frequencies.</b> The performance is illustrated using simulated 2 -D data and data obtained with the 3 -D DTU microwave imaging system...|$|R
25|$|One major {{disadvantage}} to the {{superheterodyne receiver}} {{is the problem}} of image <b>frequency.</b> In heterodyne receivers, an image <b>frequency</b> is an undesired input <b>frequency</b> equal to the station <b>frequency</b> plus twice the intermediate <b>frequency.</b> The image <b>frequency</b> results in two stations being received at the same time, thus producing interference.

40|$|Background. <b>Frequencies</b> of alloreactive T cells {{determined}} by limiting dilution assays (LDA) may not adequately reflect the donor-reactive immune status in transplant recipients. To reevaluate LDA <b>frequencies,</b> {{we developed a}} flow cytometry test for direct determination of alloreactive T-cell <b>frequencies</b> and compared these <b>frequencies</b> with classical LDA estimates of <b>frequencies.</b> Methods. For determination of <b>frequencies</b> by flow cytometry, peripheral blood lymphocytes (or lymphocytes taken from primary mixed lymphocyte culture) were stimulated with either Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines or T cell-depleted spleen cells and stained for intracellular interferon (IFN) -gamma production and CD 69. In lung transplant recipients, <b>frequencies</b> of IFN+ alloreactive T cells were compared with LDA <b>frequencies,</b> that is, cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursors and helper T lymphocyte precursors. Results. With flow cytometry, alloreactive T cells were detected after overnight allostimulation as IFN-gamma(+) CD 69 (bright) cells (range, 0. 1 - 0. 58 % and 0. 1 - 0. 66 % of total CD 4 and CD 8 cells, respectively). <b>Frequencies</b> increased 25 -fold or more when lymphocytes were prestimulated in primary mixed lymphocyte culture before testing. After lung transplantation, mean donor-specific IFN+ CD 8 T-cell <b>frequencies</b> did not decrease as mean donor-specific LDA cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursor <b>frequencies,</b> whereas no difference was seen in pretransplantation samples or third-party-specific <b>frequencies</b> at both time points.

The flow cytometry test allows a direct measurement of alloreactive T-cell <b>frequencies</b> and demonstrates a discrepancy between donor-specific IFN+ CD 8 T-cell <b>frequencies</b> and LDA CLTp after transplantation. This may be a result of the existence of "functional diverse" alloreactive T cells or of activation-induced cell death of donor-reactive T cells during long (LDA) culturing, which is avoided in the flow cytometry test...|$|R
