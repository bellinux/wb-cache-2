5|$|Following its collapse, {{there was}} some {{speculation}} about whether Great Southern had disclosed to the market issues with the rate of return <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> achieve on some of its timber investments. During parliamentary committee inquiries, these allegations were extended {{to the possibility that}} the auditors had been misled. It was also noted that, at the time that difficulties were emerging for Great Southern, its CEO sold some of his shares {{at the top of the}} companies' fortunes for $32.6 million.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} first {{proposed}} by Nintendo producer Kaori Ando, who envisioned a crossover between the Fire Emblem and Shin Megami Tensei series. Although initially reluctant {{due to their}} workload, Atlus agreed to the collaboration, {{and much of the}} early work went into deciding what genre of game <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be and how best to incorporate both series while creating an original game. The production period lasted five years. A notable feature was musical numbers produced by Japanese entertainment company Avex Group.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{directed}} by Hype Williams and was filmed in downtown Los Angeles.

Kesha explained the idea behind the video {{as well as the}} experience during an interview with MTV News; she said that the video was different from her other videos, noting that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> show a sexier side of herself.|$|E
5|$|Celtic faced Yugoslavia (now Serbian) side Vojvodina Novi Sad in the quarter-finals, {{and lost}} {{the first leg}} 1–0 after a goal from Milan Stanić; this was Celtic's only defeat of the competition. The tie looked like <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> end in a draw after Chalmers had given Celtic a 1–0 lead in the second leg. This would have {{resulted}} in the teams from having to go to Rotterdam for a replay. However, in the 90th minute captain Billy McNeill scored to give Celtic the victory. In the semi-finals, Czechoslovakian side Dukla Prague were beaten 3–1 in Glasgow, Johnstone put the hosts in front, before Stanislav Štrunc equalised. A second half brace from Willie Wallace gave Celtic the victory. The teams then drew 0–0 in Prague, which meant Celtic progressed to the final.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, SAS {{announced}} that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> reduce its commission to travel agents from 9 to 5%. Braathens followed, reducing from 8 to 5% from 1 January 1998. However, {{to try to}} attract more business passengers, the airline retained the 8% commission on their international routes. At the same time, the Government of Norway abandoned its old regime of negotiating prices with the airlines for state-employed civil servants' flights. Instead, they introduced an annual tender for the routes. It was awarded to SAS, who also won all subsequent tenders. For Braathens SAFE, this meant that state-employed civil servants only flew on routes where SAS did not fly. The contract was worth NOK500 million for SAS.|$|E
5|$|Field's {{government}} {{was startled by}} Britain's announcement in October 1963 that Nyasaland would become fully independent on 6 July 1964. While no date was set for Northern Rhodesian statehood, it was generally surmised that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> follow shortly thereafter. Smith was promptly sent to London, where he held a round of inconclusive Southern Rhodesian independence talks with the new British Prime Minister, Sir Alec Douglas-Home. Around the same time, the presence and significance of Section 111 of the 1961 constitution emerged in Southern Rhodesia, prompting speculation in political circles that a future British government might, if it were so inclined, go against previous conventions by legislating for Salisbury without its consent, withdrawing devolved powers or otherwise altering the Southern Rhodesian constitution. Fearing what the Labour Party might do if it won the next British general election (which was projected for late 1964), the Southern Rhodesians stepped up their efforts, hoping to win independence before Britain went to the polls, and preferably not after Nyasaland. The Federation dissolved as scheduled {{at the end of}} 1963.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, {{the company}} managed {{to cover it}} costs, and the company stated that it hoped to have a revenue of NOK 30 million the {{following}} year, through an ambitious expansion plan. A private offering for NOK 8 million was issued to allow this expansion. Among the purchasers was the Municipality of Narvik and Narvik Port Authority. In March, Chair Rune Arnøy was forced to withdraw after accusations of conflict of interest, since he was both chair of Ofotbanen and harbormaster at the Port of Narvik. CargoNet, a freight competitor of Ofotbanen, had {{felt that they were}} being unfairly treated by the port after the municipality had bought shares in Ofotbanen and appointed Arnøy as chair. The legality of the port's purchase of the shares was considered by the Norwegian Coastal Administration; though deemed legal, the port authority was required to sell the shares within three years. In April, Ofotbanen received a permit to operate in Sweden, and started offering charter trains between Narvik and Kiruna in Sweden, primarily for cruise ship passengers. It also announced that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> bid for the public service obligations for subsidized passenger railway transport that the government was planning to conduct in 2006. In June, Ofotbanen received permission to operate freight trains throughout the entire railway network in Norway. This was the first time such permission was granted to a different company than NSB or its subsidiaries.|$|E
5|$|Washbrook {{had been}} criticised after the First Test for playing aggressively and taking too many risks {{early in his}} innings, having fallen twice to attacking shots. He {{continued}} {{to play in a}} similar way, rather than adopting the traditional opener's strategy of not playing at any ball unless <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> hit the stumps and waiting for the bowlers to tire. Lindwall had Washbrook caught behind for eight in his fourth over, playing at a ball outside off stump, and ended his pre-lunch spell with 1/7 from six overs, while Johnston accompanied him from the other end. Neither Hutton nor Washbrook appeared comfortable against the bowling, and the new batsman Edrich tried to hit Lindwall through the off side, leading to a loud appeal for caught behind, which was turned down. After lunch, Hutton did the majority of the scoring, before playing outside a Johnson off break on the front foot and being bowled for 20 to leave England at 32/2. The English opener had been uncertain against Johnson's spin and played forward too early at a slower ball, which went between a gap between his bat and pad. Compton came in, having been dismissed hit wicket after falling over in the last Test while trying to avoid a bouncer, and Lindwall delivered a few short balls straight away, but the new batsman was not caught off-guard. Lindwall then clean bowled Edrichwho was playing across the linewith an outswinger for five. Edrich had toiled for 70 minutes in scoring those runs. Dollery came out and played the first ball with his pads before being bowled for a duck from the next delivery. Dollery's bat was still about to start its downward swing towards by the time Lindwall's outswinger had passed him and hit the stumps. O'Reilly said Dollery's inability to deal with Lindwall was typical of English cricket's lack of answers to express pace bowling. This was part of a six-over post-lunch spell by Lindwall that yielded 2/11 as the batsmen appeared unable to deal with his extreme pace. England were 46/4 and Australia firmly in control.|$|E
