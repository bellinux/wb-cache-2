25|$|High {{emissions}}. As {{unburnt fuel}} {{is in the}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>stream,</b> emissions requirements are difficult to meet. This problem may be overcome by implementing direct fuel injection into the combustion chamber. The Freedom Motors Rotapower Wankel engine, which is not yet in production, met the ultra low California emissions standards. The Mazda Renesis engine, with both intake and exhaust side ports, suppressed the loss of unburned mix to exhaust formerly induced by port overlap.|$|E

25|$|The {{kinetic energy}} of any entity {{depends on the}} {{reference}} frame {{in which it is}} measured. However the total energy of an isolated system, i.e. one in which energy can neither enter nor leave, does not change over time in the reference frame in which it is measured. Thus, the chemical energy converted to kinetic energy by a rocket engine is divided differently between the rocket ship and its <b>exhaust</b> <b>stream</b> depending upon the chosen reference frame. This is called the Oberth effect. But the total energy of the system, including kinetic energy, fuel chemical energy, heat, etc., is conserved over time, regardless of the choice of reference frame. Different observers moving with different reference frames would however disagree on the value of this conserved energy.|$|E
500|$|In addition, an {{exhaust system}} to reduce noise levels to below those from ejector {{exhausts}} was devised for the North Star/Argonaut. This [...] "cross-over" [...] system took the exhaust {{flow from the}} inboard bank of cylinders up-and-over the engine before discharging the <b>exhaust</b> <b>stream</b> on the outboard side of the UPP nacelle. As a result, sound levels were reduced by between 5 and 8 decibels. The modified exhaust also conferred an increase in horsepower over the unmodified system of , resulting in a 5 knot improvement in true air speed. Still-air range of the aircraft was also improved by around 4 per cent. The modified engine was designated the [...] "TMO" [...] and the modified exhaust system was supplied as kit that could be installed on existing engines either by the operator or by Rolls-Royce.|$|E
500|$|In February 2012 General Motors began {{deliveries}} {{of a low}} emission version {{destined for}} California that features a new low emissions package that allows the 2012 Chevrolet Volt to qualify as an enhanced, advanced technology –partial zero emissions vehicle (enhAT-PZEV) and have access to California’s high-occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV). The new standard California version of the Volt features a modified engine and exhaust components. The catalytic converter was modified to add a secondary air-injection pump that [...] "streams ambient air into the <b>exhaust</b> <b>stream</b> to increase its ability to remove pollutants." [...] Owners of a 2012 Volt with the low emissions package are eligible to apply for one of 40,000 available HOV lane stickers issued to vehicles that qualify as a California AT-PZEV. The permits are handed out on a first-apply, first-served basis. Additionally, the new low emissions package makes the 2012 Volt eligible for owners to receive up to [...] in state rebates through the state’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Project (CVRP). This incentive is {{in addition to the}} federal government’s [...] tax credit. Only the 2012 Volts manufactured after February 6, 2012, are fitted with the low emission package and sold as standard models in California. Other states where the Volt has solo driving access to HOV lanes are Florida, Georgia, New York and Virginia.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} ammonia {{distribution}} upstream {{selective catalytic reduction}} converter on selective catalytic reduction conversion efficiency has been studied in this paper. The {{results indicate that the}} more uniform ammonia concentration distribution upstream converter is, the higher NO x reduction rate and lower NH 3 slip can be achieved. By using static mixers fixed in the pipeline upstream converter, ammonia and <b>exhaust</b> <b>streams</b> can be mixed effectively on the limitation of mixing distance for marine selective catalytic reduction system. Different kinds of static mixers could lead to different degree of mixing between ammonia and <b>exhaust</b> <b>streams,</b> which will affect selective catalytic reduction conversion efficiency directly. Then comparing with the complete mixing degrees of ammonia and <b>exhaust</b> <b>streams,</b> selective catalytic reduction conversion efficiency can be used as an evaluation index for static mixers. Based on CFD method, the effect of mixing degrees of different static mixers on selective catalytic reduction conversion efficiency can be obtained by simulating current commercial catalysts with several different kinds of static mixers such as GK mixer, SK mixer, contour mixer, star-shaped mixer. The trend of NO x reduction rate and NH x slip changing with ammonia distribution and velocity distribution before selective catalytic reduction catalyst layers can be summarized by analyzing the simulating data. The results can be used to help engineering applications...|$|R
40|$|Pellets {{made of a}} high-surface-area {{composite}} of silica and titania have shown promise as means of removing elemental mercury from flue gases. With further technical development and commercialization, this material could become economically attractive as a more effective, less-expensive alternative to activated carbons for removing mercury from <b>exhaust</b> <b>streams</b> of coal-burning power plants, which are the sources of more than 90 percent of all anthropogenic airborne mercury...|$|R
500|$|The VRDK was a motorjet, a {{rudimentary}} type of jet engine where an external power source drove the engine's compressor. It forced {{air into the}} stainless steel combustion chamber where fuel was sprayed from seven nozzles and ignited to exhaust out the variable rear nozzle. In the I-250 a [...] Klimov VK-107R V-12 piston engine {{was used as the}} primary powerplant. After takeoff a clutch {{at the end of the}} crankshaft could be engaged which drove a step up gearbox with a ratio of 13:21 to an extension shaft that powered the compressor of the VRDK. The air for the compressor was fed through a long duct that ran from the inlet underneath the propeller spinner, thence under the engine and through the belly of the aircraft. This duct also fed air to the oil cooler near the engine, but the water radiator was positioned behind the compressor to maximize airflow over it. A secondary duct led from the main duct to the VK-107's supercharger; when the VRDK was running the secondary duct diverted some of that additional air to the supercharger which boosted the engine's output to [...] at [...] The increased airflow over the engine radiator helped to dump the engine's excess heat into the <b>exhaust</b> <b>stream.</b> However the VRDK was limited to only ten minutes' operating time per sortie, which meant that it was useless weight during the rest of the flight.|$|E
2500|$|In fact, rockets {{work more}} {{efficiently}} in space than in an atmosphere. Multistage rockets {{are capable of}} attaining escape velocity from Earth and therefore can achieve unlimited maximum altitude. [...] Compared with airbreathing engines, rockets are lightweight and powerful and capable of generating large accelerations. To control their flight, rockets rely on momentum, airfoils, auxiliary reaction engines, gimballed thrust, momentum wheels, deflection of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>stream,</b> propellant flow, spin, and/or gravity.|$|E
2500|$|Spedding also {{introduced}} {{the practice of}} [...] "coursing the air". As in other pits, the working areas were ventilated by fresh air, drawn down one half of a partitioned shaft; the air was then exhausted up {{the other half of}} the shaft, the air circulation being driven by a furnace at the base of the return half of the shaft: wooden partitioning and doors were used to prevent short-circuiting between feed and exhaust flows within the mine. Spedding improved this by ensuring that [...] after ventilating areas currently being worked the <b>exhaust</b> <b>stream</b> was routed through previously worked areas to eliminate any possibility of firedamp accumulation in unventilated volumes. This practice also spread from the Lowther pits to become standard practice in other coalfields.|$|E
50|$|Mechanically aided {{scrubbers}} {{have been}} used to control <b>exhaust</b> <b>streams</b> containing particulate matter. They have the advantage of being smaller than most other scrubbing systems, since the fan is incorporated into the scrubber. In addition, they operate with low liquid-to-gas ratios. Their disadvantages include their generally high maintenance requirements, low absorption efficiency, and high operating costs. The performance characteristics of mechanically aided scrubbers are given in Table 1.|$|R
50|$|A {{regenerative}} {{thermal oxidizer}} (RTO) {{is a piece of}} industrial equipment used for the treatment of exhaust air. The system is a type of thermal oxidizer that uses a bed of ceramic material to absorb heat from the exhaust gas. It then uses this captured heat to preheat the incoming process gas stream and destroy air pollutants emitted from process <b>exhaust</b> <b>streams</b> at temperatures ranging from 815 °C (1,500 F) to 980 °C (1,800 F).|$|R
50|$|Some engines, such as V-type engines, utilize two identically sized, each fed by a {{separate}} set of <b>exhaust</b> <b>streams</b> from the engine. Having two smaller turbos {{produce the same}} aggregate amount of boost as a larger single turbo allows them to reach their optimal rpm, more quickly, thus improving boost delivery. Such an arrangement of turbos is typically {{referred to as a}} parallel twin-turbo system. The first production automobile with parallel twin turbochargers was the Maserati Biturbo of the early 1980s.|$|R
2500|$|The {{technology}} for pre-combustion is widely applied in fertilizer, chemical, gaseous fuel (H2, CH4), and power production. In these cases, the fossil fuel is partially oxidized, {{for instance in}} a gasifier. The resulting syngas (CO and H2) is [...] shifted into [...] and H2. The resulting [...] can be captured from a relatively pure <b>exhaust</b> <b>stream.</b> The H2 can now be used as fuel; the carbon dioxide is removed before combustion takes place. There are several advantages and disadvantages when compared to conventional post combustion carbon dioxide capture. The [...] is removed after combustion of fossil fuels, but before the flue gas is expanded to atmospheric pressure. This scheme is applied to new fossil fuel burning power plants, or to existing plants where re-powering is an option. The capture before expansion, i.e. from pressurized gas, is standard in almost all industrial [...] capture processes, at the same scale as will be required for utility power plants.|$|E
2500|$|The {{trailing}} side of {{the rotary}} engine's combustion chamber develops a squeeze stream which pushes back the flame front. With the conventional one or two-spark-plug system and homogenous mixture, this squeeze stream prevents the flame from propagating to the combustion chamber's trailing side in the mid and high engine speed ranges. Kawasaki dealt with that problem in its US patent , and Toyota obtained a 7% economy improvement by placing a glow-plug in the leading site, and using Reed-Valves in intake ducts. This poor combustion in the trailing side of chamber {{is one of the}} reasons why there is more carbon monoxide and unburnt hydrocarbons in a Wankel's <b>exhaust</b> <b>stream.</b> A side-port exhaust, as is used in the Mazda Renesis, avoids one of the causes of this because the unburned mixture cannot escape. The Mazda 26B avoided this problem through the use of a three spark-plug ignition system. (At the 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race in 1991, the 26B had significantly lower fuel consumption than the competing reciprocating piston engines. All competitors had the same amount of fuel available due to the Le Mans limited fuel quantity rule.) ...|$|E
5000|$|In a wet {{scrubbing}} system, dust particles {{will tend to}} follow the streamlines of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>stream.</b> However, when liquid droplets are introduced into the <b>exhaust</b> <b>stream,</b> particles cannot always follow these streamlines as they diverge around the droplet (Figure 1). The particle's mass causes it {{to break away from}} the streamlines and impactor hit the droplet.|$|E
50|$|Thermal {{wheels are}} not {{suitable}} for use where total separation of supply and <b>exhaust</b> air <b>streams</b> is required, since air will bypass at the interface between the air streams at the heat exchanger boundary, and {{at the point where}} the wheel passes from one air stream to the other during its normal rotation. The former is reduced by brush seals, and the latter is reduced by a small purge section, formed by plating off a small segment of the wheel, normally in the <b>exhaust</b> air <b>stream.</b>|$|R
40|$|The sound {{pressures}} {{radiating from}} the <b>exhaust</b> <b>streams</b> of two convergent-divergent and one convergent nozzle were measured.

The {{results are presented}} {{in a series of}} contour maps of overall and fine 1 / 3 -octave-band sound pressures. The location of the source of the noise in each 1 / 3 -octave band in the frequency range of 30 to 16, 000 cps and the total power radiated were determined and compared with those of subsonic jets...|$|R
50|$|Thermal Wheel or rotary heat exchanger: {{consists}} of a circular honeycomb matrix of heat absorbing material, which is slowly rotated within the supply and <b>exhaust</b> air <b>streams</b> of an air handling system.|$|R
50|$|When {{catalytic}} converters were first introduced, most vehicles used carburetors {{that provided a}} relatively rich air-fuel ratio. Oxygen (O2) levels in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>stream</b> were therefore generally insufficient for the catalytic reaction to occur efficiently. Most designs of the time therefore included secondary air injection, which injected air into the <b>exhaust</b> <b>stream.</b> This increased the available oxygen, allowing the catalyst to function as intended.|$|E
50|$|LITV {{consists}} of injecting a liquid into the <b>exhaust</b> <b>stream</b> after the nozzle throat. The liquid then vaporizes, {{and in most}} cases chemically reacts, adding mass flow {{to one side of the}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>stream</b> and thus providing a control moment. For example, the Titan IIIC solid boosters injected nitrogen tetroxide for LITV; the tanks can be seen on the sides of the rocket between the main center stage and the boosters.|$|E

5000|$|A thermal wheel {{consists}} of a circular honeycomb matrix of heat-absorbing material, which is slowly rotated within the supply and <b>exhaust</b> air <b>streams</b> of an air-handling system. As the thermal wheel rotates, heat is picked up from the <b>exhaust</b> air <b>stream</b> in {{one half of the}} rotation and given up to the fresh air stream in {{the other half of the}} rotation. Thus waste heat energy from the <b>exhaust</b> air <b>stream</b> is transferred to the matrix material and then from the matrix material to the fresh air stream, raising the temperature of the supply air stream by an amount proportional to the temperature differential between air streams, or [...] "thermal gradient", and depending upon the efficiency of the device. Heat exchange is most efficient when the streams flow in opposite directions, since this causes a favourable temperature gradient across the thickness of the wheel. The principle of course works in reverse, and [...] "cooling" [...] energy can be recovered to the supply air stream if so desired and the temperature differential allows.|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} {{treatment is}} presented for a flowfield {{generated by a}} pair of interacting, two-dimensional parallel jets, representative of the two <b>exhaust</b> <b>streams</b> issuing from the thrust augmentor nozzles of dual lifting jet VTOL aircraft propulsion systems. Predictions of the analysis for the ratio of primary to secondary velocity are in close agreement with experimentally observed values, if the spreading rate parameter is allowed to assume a value greater than that which applies to a free jet. Theoretical results are combined with existing experimental data for unventilated jets, in order to arrive at an estimate of the thrust augmentation produced by a jet pair with an arbitrary degree of ventilation...|$|R

50|$|Small liquid {{droplets}} {{cool the}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>stream</b> {{more quickly than}} large droplets because they evaporate more easily. Therefore, less liquid is required. However, in most scrubbing systems, approximately one-and-a-half to two and- a-half times the theoretical evaporation demand is required to ensure proper cooling. Evaporation also depends on time; it does not occur instantaneously. Therefore, the quencher should be sized to allow for an adequate <b>exhaust</b> <b>stream</b> residence time. Normal residence times range from 0.15 to 0.25 seconds for gases under 540°C (1000°F) to 0.2 to 0.3 seconds for gases hotter than 540°C.|$|E
5000|$|Very small {{particles}} (less than 0.1 µm in diameter) experience random movement in an <b>exhaust</b> <b>stream.</b> These particles are so tiny {{that they are}} bumped by gas molecules as they move in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>stream.</b> This bumping, or bombardment, causes them to first move one way and then another in a random manner, or to diffuse, through the gas. This irregular motion can cause the particles to collide with a droplet and be collected (Figure 2). Because of this, diffusion is the primary collection mechanism in wet scrubbers for particles smaller than 0.1 µm.|$|E
