This approach utilizes the vast amount of repetitive sequence deposited in the human genome over the past ~ 250 MYR. Using this approach we estimate the frequencies of seven types of substitutions: the four transversions, two transitions, and the methyl-assisted transition of cytosine in CpG. Comparing substitutional patterns in repetitive elements of various ages, we reconstruct the history of the base-substitutional process in the different <b>isochores</b> for the past 250 Myr. At around 90 Myr ago (around the time of the mammalian radiation), we find an abrupt 4 - to 8 -fold increase of the cytosine transition rate in CpG pairs compared to that of the reptilian ancestor. Further analysis of nucleotide substitutions in regions with different GC-content reveals concurrent changes in the substitutional patterns. While the substitutional pattern was dependent on {{the regional}} GC-content in such ways that it preserved the regional GC-content before the mammalian radiation, it lost this dependence afterwards.

Results The present availability of a number of fully sequenced genomes ranging from fishes to mammals allowed us to carry out investigations that (i) more precisely quantified our previous conclusions; (ii) showed that the different <b>isochore</b> families of vertebrate genomes are largely conserved in GC levels and dinucleotide frequencies, as well as in <b>isochore</b> size; and (iii) <b>isochore</b> family patterns can be either conserved or change within both warm- and cold-blooded vertebrates. Conclusion On the basis of the results presented, we propose that (i) the large conservation of GC levels and dinucleotide frequencies may reflect the conservation of chromatin structures; (ii) the conservation of <b>isochore</b> size may be linked to the role played by isochores in chromosome structure and replication; (iii) the formation, the maintainance and the changes of <b>isochore</b> patterns are due to natural selection. </p...|$|E
