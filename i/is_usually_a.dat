5|$|In some monarchies—such as Belgium, Denmark, Japan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and Thailand—promulgation is {{required}} {{as well as}} royal assent. In other monarchies—such as Sweden—the government officially promulgates laws.

5|$|The dive {{profile is}} often {{recorded}} {{in some way}} {{as part of a}} permanent record of the dive. Maximum depth, bottom time and any decompression required are routinely logged by most professional divers, for whom it may be a legal requirement, and by many recreational divers, for whom it <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> recommendation of the training agencies.|$|E

Odonata have their humeral plate greatly enlarged, with two muscles arising from the episternum inserted into the Humeral plates and two {{from the edge of the}} epimeron inserted into the axillary plate.|$|E
5|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon lives mostly along mountain ranges, river valleys, coastlines, and increasingly in cities. In mild-winter regions, it <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> permanent resident, and some individuals, especially adult males, will {{remain on the}} breeding territory. Only populations that breed in Arctic climates typically migrate great distances during the northern winter.|$|E
5|$|A bikini <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> women's {{abbreviated}} two-piece swimsuit with a bra top for {{the chest}} and underwear cut below the navel.

5|$|After {{the launch}} of the {{persecution}} campaign in 1999, practitioners outside China began holding frequent protests, rallies, and appeals. These include large-scale marches, demonstrations, and vigils to coincide with notable anniversaries, such as April 25, 1999, and July 20, 1999. Marches typically involve participants holding signs and banners, devoting different sections of the parade to different aspects of the persecution. There <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> section involving participants wearing only white (symbolizing mourning) and holding photos of those killed in China.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} major fast food vendors, BK has a menu that {{specifically}} targets children. The company introduced its child-oriented product line in North America {{during the summer}} of 1990 with an advertising program called the Burger King Kid's Club. In the United States, the meal is called the Kids Club Meal and it is primarily positioned against the popular Happy Meal from McDonald's. The meal includes an entrée, a side order, beverage, and a toy. The toy <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> product tie-in with a movie or popular television show. The entrée and side offerings differ from market to market, as does portion size.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to other}} {{shooters}} where melee <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> last resort, F.E.A.R.'s melee {{is a viable}} instant-kill alternative for taking down enemies. The stocks of all firearms {{can be used in}} close combat. Lighter weapons, while being less powerful, allow the player to move around more quickly, increasing their chances of melee. Movement speed is maximized if a player holsters their weapon, which also allows them to engage in hand-to-hand attacks with maneuvers including punches, kicks, and slides.|$|E

5|$|In the brain, AVMs {{occasionally}} exert pressure, {{leading to}} headaches. They may {{also increase the}} risk of seizures, as would any abnormal tissue in the brain. Finally, hemorrhage from an AVM may lead to intracerebral hemorrhage (bleeding into the brain), which causes any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness in part of the body or difficulty speaking. If the bleeding occurs into the subarachnoid space (subarachnoid hemorrhage), there <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> severe, sudden headache and decreased level of consciousness and often weakness in part of the body.|$|E
5|$|It has {{parallel}} wing bars on {{the half}} of the wings connected near the white patch giving it a distinctive appearance in flight. The black central rectrices and typical white lateral rectrices are also noticeable in flight. The iris <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> light green-yellow or a yellow, {{but there have been}} instances of an orange color. The bill is black with a brownish black appearance at the base. The juvenile appearance is marked by its streaks on its back, distinguished spots and streaks on its chest, and a gray or grayish-green iris.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> {{permanent}} resident throughout its range, although birds {{at the extreme}} north of its range may migrate short distances, and others across their range may undergo local movements in unfavourable conditions. In South America, its range stretches to central Chile and Argentina. It also is found as a vagrant on the islands of the Caribbean. It prefers open land interspersed with areas of woods or brush. It {{is also found in}} moist lowland forests, shrublands and grasslands, wetlands and swamps, pastures, and heavily degraded former forests. Preferring lowlands, it is rarely seen in mountainous areas. It is usually seen soaring or perched on fence posts or dead trees.|$|E

The mane and tail <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> sooty silver, darker at the roots, and the legs <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> flat, brownish-grey mottled with silver. The hair around the eyes and muzzle may also show signs of silvering.|$|R
5|$|Like all insects, wasps {{have a hard}} {{exoskeleton}} {{which protects}} their three main body parts, the head, the mesosoma (including the thorax and the first segment of the abdomen) and the metasoma. There is a narrow waist, the petiole, joining {{the first and second}} segments of the abdomen. The two pairs of membranous wings are held together by small hooks and the forewings are larger than the hind ones; in some species, the females have no wings. In females there <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> rigid ovipositor which may be modified for injecting venom, piercing or sawing. It either extends freely or can be retracted, and may be developed into a stinger for both defence and for paralysing prey.|$|E
5|$|Of the 118 Category 4 hurricanes {{that have}} {{formed in the}} eastern and central Pacific basins, 25 have made {{landfall}}. Of them, four made landfall at Category 4 intensity, three at Category 3, eleven at Categories 2 and 1, six as tropical storms, and five as tropical depressions. Several of these storms weakened slightly after attaining Category 4 status as they approached land; this <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> result of dry air, shallower water due to shelving, cooler waters, or interaction with land. Only in five years – 1976, 1983, 1992, 1997, and 2014 – more than one Category 4 hurricane made landfall, and only during one year – 1992 – did three Category 4 hurricanes made landfall.|$|E

Today the Pennsylvanian {{continues}} {{to use an}} all-Amfleet consist {{although the number of}} coaches has grown to six. The train consists of an Amfleet I business class car, an Amfleet I cafe car, an Amfleet I coach, and three Amfleet II long-distance coach cars.

5|$|Relay {{races are}} the only track and field event in which a team of runners {{directly}} compete against other teams. Typically, a team {{is made up of}} four runners of the same sex. Each runner completes their specified distance (referred to as a leg) before handing over a baton to a teammate, who then begins their leg upon receiving the baton. There <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> designated area where athletes must exchange the baton. Teams may be disqualified if they fail to complete the change within the area, or if the baton is dropped during the race. A team may also be disqualified if its runners are deemed to have wilfully impeded other competitors.|$|E
5|$|Silver birch {{can easily}} be {{confused}} with the similar downy birch (Betula pubescens). Yet, downy birch are characterised by hairy leaves and young shoots whereas the same parts on silver birch are hairless. The leaf base of silver birch <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> right angle to the stalk while for downy birch it is rounded. In terms of genetic structure the trees are quite different but do, however occasionally hybridise.|$|E
5|$|The Jugal Region, or Neala, is {{a region}} of the wing that <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>a</b> small {{membranous}} area proximal {{to the base of}} the vannus strengthened by a few small, irregular veinlike thickenings; but when well developed it is a distinct section of the wing and may contain one or two jugal veins. When the jugal area of the forewing is developed as a free lobe, it projects beneath the humeral angle of the hindwing and thus serves to yoke the two wings together. In the Jugatae group of Lepidoptera it bears a long finger-like lobe. The jugal region was termed the neala ("new wing") because it is evidently a secondary and recently developed part of the wing.|$|E
