I seem to feel the sense of {{impending}} calamity, to hear the guns as <b>I</b> <b>walk,</b> <b>to</b> see the terror fall upon the faces of all these great crowds who throng your streets.

60|$|But that {{error was}} a fearful one, and cost them and me, Heaven only knows how much. And now, <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> Strid, and Abbey, and everywhere, with {{the ghosts of}} the past days {{haunting}} me, and other darker spirits of sorrow and remorse and wonder. Black spirits among the gray, all like a mist {{between me and the}} green woods. And I feel like a caterpillar,--stung just enough. Foul weather and mist enough, of quite a real kind besides. An hour's sunshine to-day, broken up speedily, and now veiled utterly.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> {{the front}} window, and {{look across the}} road upon a long, straggling row of houses, one story high, terminating, nearly opposite, but {{a little to the}} left, in a melancholy piece of waste ground with frowzy grass, which looks like a small piece of country that has taken to drinking, and has quite lost itself. Standing anyhow and all wrong, upon this open space, like {{something}} meteoric that has fallen down from the moon, is an odd, lop-sided, one-eyed kind of wooden building, that looks like a church, with a flag- staff as long as itself sticking out of a steeple something larger than a tea-chest. Under the window is a small stand of coaches, whose slave-drivers are sunning themselves on the steps of our door, and talking idly together. The three most obtrusive houses near at hand are the three meanest. On one - a shop, which never has anything in the window, and never has the door open - is painted in large characters, 'THE CITY LUNCH.' At another, which looks like a backway to somewhere else, but is an independent building in itself, oysters are procurable in every style. At the third, which is a very, very little tailor's shop, pants are fixed to order; or in other words, pantaloons are made to measure. And that is our street in Washington.|$|E

Later I went to work--imprinted the stamp on clay bottles, before they were baked. It was an earthenware-bottle factory. There I began making models. One day, I had had enough.

The Ministry of Justice was expected to request the President of the parliament to vote to remove Sochua's parliamentary immunity.

5000|$|Where {{the hell}} do any of you get off, telling me I sold out? Where do you get off? Where {{do you find the}} nerve, to call me a whore? You think I hate ECW? I love that place. I love that place! But ECW simply didn't love me back. She was like the girl I can't let go off, but the one who makes me sick, upon seeing her. She wanted too much blood, too much of my heart, too much of my life! So I left, and I found fame and fortune in WWE. And Paul Heyman was right. There's only one real {{difference}} between me and Tommy Dreamer. I'm a whore, and he's not. You see, seven years ago, I pulled the sock out of my pants, and made Vince McMahon laugh, and the doors of opportunity open wide for Mick Foley, but not for Tommy Dreamer. All he's got is his heart, his pride and the initials ECW. And I wanted to tell Edge that I went back and I watched our WrestleMania match, the greatest hardcore match of all time, I said. Well the truth is, maybe it wasn't quite as good as I thought. Maybe Edge, you and I are gonna have to be tougher than ever, hungrier than ever, sicker than ever, to walk into that steaming cesspool that is the Hammerstein Ballroom. 2,500 sickening, twisted fans, screaming for our blood, because Tommy Dreamer can do everything I can, and maybe with more passion. He's gonna beat us up, all over New York City. He's gonna bludgeon us. Terry Funk, the greatest wrestler I ever saw. You look at Terry Funk and you see an old man, you're not seeing the real Terry Funk. His slaps are worse than most men's punches. His punches dole out concussions, and when he picks up a weapon, he can use it like no man ever has. He has an excruciating pain waking up every single day, looking for one more chance to have one great last match. I blew {{the son of a bitch}} up in Japan, and he came back and hugged me. I set him up on fire in Philadelphia, and he put his arm around me. He doesn't put his arm around me anymore. I don't want your arm around me, Terry Funk. Tommy Dreamer, the only difference between me and you, is I have the guts to go to WWE. (At this point, a fan was audibly heard on the telecast telling Foley to shut up.) No, you shut your mouth! (pointing out to said fan) Because when I go to Hammerstein Ballroom, Edge and I are prepared to take the beatings of our lives, and I will do that to exorcise the sick, twisted whore that is ECW. I want her out of my life. You’ve seen me thrown off cells, you've seen me slammed in tacks, you've seen me go through a burning table at WrestleMania; it is nothing compared to the horrors I will unleash on Dreamer and Funk at (goddamn you) ECW. 'Cause I'm gonna stake the hearts of your heroes, and I'm gonna shove them down their throats for making me fall in love with you to begin with. You stepped on my heart, you stepped on my soul, you took everything I've had faith in, and you just throw it away. And then when <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> that ring at the Hammerstein Ballroom as a WWE Legend, you Terry Funk and you Tommy Dreamer will learn about loss...Have a nice day.

40|$|It is {{the last}} round of a very long day of judging and I am ready for food and my bed. As <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> the round I read the topic to myself: This house would fight the fight, and wonder what "canned " case the gov-ernment is going to run. As the debate begins I realize that I am in trouble. The {{government}} has decided to fight the fight by enacting a plan to stop the illegal dumping of hazardous waste in Mexico. As the prime minister waxes eloquently about the harms of illegally dumping hazardous waste into the environment I wonder to myself: does anyone really {{think this is a}} good idea—at least anyone not involved directly with the illegal behavior? Is there anyone that really thinks that the question of should we or should we not illegally dump hazardous waste is up for debate in the homes and coffee shops of average American citizens? As the prime minister illus-trates the advantages to stopping illegal dumping I wonder what fight the government is really fighting.

40|$|Making {{enough money}} to survive in New York City is {{challenging}} for many, especially for those struggling at the lowest end of the pay scale. Every day {{tens of thousands of}} low wage workers in New York City must ask themselves these difficult questions: Which utility should I pay this month: the telephone or the gas? Should <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> work [...] more than an hour [...] to avoid the $ 5. 00 round trip subway cost? How will I afford to feed my family? New York Communities Organizing Fund, Inc. (NYCOFI) and New York Communities for Change (NYCC) surveyed low wage workers in a variety of industries around New York City to get a real-world view of life {{in one of the most}} expensive cities in the country. This paper makes specific recommendations that are informed by employment statistics, an analysis of the supports that are available to workers, and our own research in the field. We hope this paper will be a starting place for those low wage workers organizing for better conditions. We also hope it will be a factual source for those policy makers working for better conditions for low wage workers. In a city with so much wealth, no one should be struggling day-to-day just to get by...|$|E
40|$|Ross 2 ̆ 7 Goose. A single bird came to Heartwell Lake (in the Hastings area) in mid-December 1995 and {{has been}} here up to now (4 April 1996). It is not injured and flies well, but it has chosen to stay because Hastings uses a device to keep the water open. I threw food out {{especially}} to the little goose because the larger domestic ducks chase it away. It is so used to me by now that it will come to within 12 - 15 feet of me. <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> the lake nearly every day, and the wild Mallards, Lesser Scaups, Ringnecked Ducks, Canvasbacks, and Redheads also come for food. Ring-necked Duck. On 16 December 1995 at about 2 : 30 P. M., a duck on a small pond {{on the east side}} of the Pfizer Co., 601 W Cornhusker Hwy, Lincoln, was observed from a vehicle with Nikon 8 X 40 Egret binoculars at a distance of approximately 25 - 30 yards. It had a black head, a breast with gray sides, and a black back. The most distinctive feature was its bill, with a white ring separating the base from the face. the bill also had another white ring near the tip. Merlin, European Goldfinch, and other species. A Merlin sits in the lilac bush in the yard and looks all around, but I have not seen it catch a bird (written 19 February 1996).
