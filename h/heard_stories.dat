As his father taught at their home, Soeman began learning to read the Quran at a young age. Meanwhile, from the traders who visited Wahid, he also <b>heard</b> <b>stories</b> of the crimes committed in major cities such as Singapore. In 1913 Soeman enrolled at a local Malay school, where his teachers reinforced the importance of reading. Soeman took this lesson to heart, reading numerous books by European and Malay authors from the school library before he graduated in 1918.|$|E
5|$|Leif's {{successful}} expedition in Vinland encouraged other Norsemen to {{also make}} the journey. The first apparent contact between the Norse and the indigenous people, who the Norse later referred to as skr√¶lingjar, was made by his brother Thorvald, and resulted in hostilities and killing. In the end there were no permanent Norse settlements in Vinland, although sporadic voyages at least to Markland for forages, timber and trade possibly lasted for centuries. The casual tone of references to these areas may suggest that their discovery was not seen as particularly significant by contemporaries, or that it {{was assumed to be}} public knowledge, or both. Knowledge of the Vinland journeys might have spread around medieval Europe, as writers such as Adam of Bremen made mention of remote lands to the west. It has been suggested that the knowledge of Vinland might have been maintained in European seaports in the 15th century, and that Christopher Columbus, who claimed in a letter to have visited Iceland in 1477, could have <b>heard</b> <b>stories</b> of it.|$|E
5|$|The tomb of Archimedes {{carried a}} {{sculpture}} illustrating his favorite mathematical proof, {{consisting of a}} sphere and a cylinder of the same height and diameter. Archimedes had proven that the volume and surface area of the sphere are two thirds that of the cylinder including its bases. In 75BC, 137 years after his death, the Roman orator Cicero was serving as quaestor in Sicily. He had <b>heard</b> <b>stories</b> about the tomb of Archimedes, {{but none of the}} locals were able to give him the location. Eventually he found the tomb near the Agrigentine gate in Syracuse, in a neglected condition and overgrown with bushes. Cicero had the tomb cleaned up, and was able to see the carving and read some of the verses that had been added as an inscription. A tomb discovered in the courtyard of the Hotel Panorama in Syracuse in the early 1960s was claimed to be that of Archimedes, but there was no compelling evidence for this and the location of his tomb today is unknown.|$|E

Having <b>heard</b> <b>stories</b> about his parents' ancestors, he wanted to visit Africa, which he considered his spiritual home.

On the day following his return to New York, Morrell was appointed captain of Wasp, while Johnson took over the schooner Henry.

500|$|Hosseini {{first began}} to {{consider}} the plot of And the Mountains Echoed during a 2007 trip to Afghanistan with the UN Refugee Agency. While there, he <b>heard</b> <b>stories</b> from several village elders about the deaths of young, impoverished children during the winters, which gave {{the foundation for the}} fundamental event of the novel: a parent's choice to sell a child to prevent this from occurring. [...] "The novel began very, very small, and it began with a single image in my head that I simply could not shed," [...] he relayed. [...] "It was the image of a man walking across the desert and he's pulling a little Radio Flyer red wagon, and in it there's a little girl about 3 years old, and there's a boy walking behind him, and these three people are walking across the desert." [...] Hosseini originally planned for it to be written in a linear fashion similar to his previous novels, but, during the writing process, it was expanded to cover a series of interconnected stories surrounding a large number of characters not directly related to each other. Comparing the process to a tree, he stated that story [...] "just branched out" [...] and [...] "got bigger and bigger as it went along".|$|E
500|$|Like other fantasy novels, the Septimus Heap {{series is}} set in an {{imaginary}} world. Maps are provided {{in all of the}} books. Magyk contains a map of the Castle and its surroundings to the Port in the south. An enlarged map of the Castle is also included. Flyte has a map showing the Badlands and the Borderlands in the north. Physik has an enlarged map of the Castle with more details showing the Alchemie chambers. Queste has a map for the House of Foryx, drawn by Snorri for Marcellus. Syren keeps the past maps but adds the isles of Syren. The map in Syren also mentions that the country that Septimus lives in is called [...] "The Small Wet Country Across the Sea". Darke has a map similar to that in Magyk, however, instead of including Marram Marshes which are south of the castle, it includes a map of the Darke Halls, bleak creek and the bottomless whirlpool. It also includes an enlarged map of the castle. At the end of Fyre, Septimus writes in the snow that the date is [...] 4 July 12,004. The book ends with a quote from Arthur C Clarke: [...] "Any Sufficiently Advanced Technology is Indistinguishable from Magyk"., hinting that the series {{is set in}} the far future. This also hinted at by a dialogue between Lucy Gringe and Wolf Boy in Syren about the Red Tube. Wolf Boy says he has <b>heard</b> <b>stories</b> that people used to travel to the moon in things like that. Lucy dismisses this, however, it's apparent they are talking about Apollo moon missions. [...] Hints that the story is set in the future also reveal themselves when Septimus and the possessed Syrah enter a chamber that goes up and down with the press of a button, indicating that they used an elevator.|$|E
