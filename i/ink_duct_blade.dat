The general function of the pre-swirl duct was set to work against this asymmetry of wake and generate pre-swirled flow into the propeller against the propeller ro-tating direction.

40|$|This {{computer}} program {{was developed for}} calculating the subsonic or transonic flow on the hub-shroud mid-channel stream surface of a single blade row of a turbomachine. The design and analysis of blades for compressors and turbines ideally requires methods for analyzing unsteady, three-dimensional, turbulent viscous flow through a turbomachine. Since an exact solution is impossible at present, solutions on two-dimensional surfaces are calculated to obtain a quasi-three dimensional solution. When three-dimensional effects are important, significant information {{can be obtained from}} a solution on a cross-sectional surface of the passage normal to the flow. With this program, a solution to the equations of flow on the meridional surface can be carried out. This solution is chosen when the turbomachine under consideration has significant variation in flow properties in the hubshroud direction, especially when input is needed for use in blade-to-blade calculations. The program can also perform flow calculations for annular <b>ducts</b> without <b>blades.</b> This program should prove very useful in the design and analysis of any turbomachine. This program calculates a solution for two-dimensional, adiabatic shockfree flow. The flow must be essentially subsonic, but there may be local areas of supersonic flow. To obtain the solution, this program uses both the finite difference and the quasi-orthogonal (velocity gradient) methods combined in a way that takes maximum advantage of both. The finite-difference method solves a finite-difference equation along the meridional stream surface in a very efficient manner but is limited to subsonic velocities. This approach must be used in cases where the blade aspect ratios are above one, cases where the passage is curved, and cases with low hub-tip-ratio blades. The quasi-orthogonal method solves the velocity gradient equation on the meridional surface and is used if it is necessary to extend the range of solutions into the transonic regime. In general the blade row may be fixed or rotating and the blades may be twisted and leaned. The flow may be axial, radial, or mixed. The upstream and downstream flow conditions can vary from hub to shroud with provisions made for an approximate correction for loss of stagnation pressure. Also, viscous forces are neglected along solution mesh lines running from hub to tip. The capabilities of this program include handling of nonaxial flows without restriction, annular <b>ducts</b> without <b>blades,</b> and specified streamwise loss distributions. This program is written in FORTRAN IV for batch execution and has been implemented on an IBM 360 computer with a central memory requirement of approximately 700 K of 8 bit bytes.

40|$|The report gives {{particulars}} of {{a method of}} calculation, which has been programmed for a digital computer, for linearized two-dimensional subsonic unsteady flow through a cascade of flat plates operating at zero mean incidence. Inputs to the calculation are motion of the blades due to either bending or torsional vibration, wakes from moving obstructions upstream of the cascade, and incoming acoustic waves. For each of these inputs the output gives the force and moment on the blades, the wakes shed from the trailing edges, and the outgoing acoustic waves. The program therefore provides all the information necessary for calculation of forced and self-excited vibration of the blades, and for the generation, transmission, and reflection of acoustic waves by a cascade. Two kinds of acoustic resonance are found, one corresponding to resonance of an annular <b>duct</b> without <b>blades,</b> and the other being an acoustic resonance in the passages between the blades.

40|$|The {{centrifugal}} turbine architecture {{represents a}} promising solution for Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) Systems, in the smallto- medium power range. The large volumetric expansion ratios occurring in ORC turbines complicate {{the design of}} the turboexpander, making the centrifugal arrangement worth of interest with respect to conventional architectures. A new-concept centrifugal turbine has been recently proposed by the authors, based on the design of Ljungstr¨om but implementing a stator-rotor arrangement, which allows for multi-stage assembly without compromising compactness. To properly evaluate the potential of the centrifugal turbine solution, reliable data on cascade aerodynamic performances are required, but they are still lacking in the open literature. In this paper the aerodynamics of radial-outward turbine cascades is discussed, on the basis of Computational Fluid-Dynamics (CFD) simulations.

30|$|Shock wave {{boundary}} layer interactions occur in many aerospace applications. Some examples include ramjet isolator <b>ducts,</b> turbine <b>blade</b> tip gaps, and transonic wings. However, low frequency unsteadiness associated with shock wave {{boundary layer}} interactions {{is not well}} understood {{and continues to be}} a debated topic. This is because different studies concluded different and contradicting results. Some results indicated that shock wave unsteadiness originates from the turbulence in the upstream boundary layer. Other results indicated that a separation region formed as part of the shock wave boundary layer interaction generates the unsteadiness. Still other studies showed that both the upstream and downstream sources are responsible for shock wave unsteadiness. Clemens and Narayanaswamy [1] summarized some of the possibilities. Many methods and analysis approaches were used to collect and analyze associated data. For example, power spectral densities and cross correlations were often used, especially for wall pressure signal data. Many of these investigations also employed Schlieren and shadowgraph imaging to determine unsteady and spatially-varying shock wave structure. Erengil and Dolling [2], Handa et al. [3], Dupont et al. [4], and Bruce and Babinsky [5], among others, measured static pressure variations with time. Spatial pressure variations were then associated with shock wave position and motion. Power spectral densities were computed from time sequence pressure data at specific locations to determine the frequencies of the unsteadiness at various locations in the flow field. Bruce and Babinsky [5] also used schlieren imaging to determine the streamwise location of the shock wave. Gamba [6] used shock wave position with respect to time, in addition to the single location pressure measurements, to determine unsteadiness characteristics. Cross-spectrum and time lag were computed for pressure fluctuations and shock wave positions, such that pressure fluctuations were given relative to the position of the upstream most shock wave. Ganapathisubramani et al. [7] and Humble et al. [8] computed cross correlations between turbulent structures in the upstream boundary layer and the shock wave from particle image velocimetry data. They detected significant coherence between the turbulent structures in the upstream boundary layer and the shock wave motion. Other recent investigations which considered different methods of shock wave data analysis were described by Ganapathisubramani and Clemens [9], Wu and Martin [10], Piponniau et al. [11], Pirozzoli et al. [12], Touber and Sandham [13], and Grilli et al. [14]. Settles [15] also provided useful information in regard to schlieren and shadowgraph visualization techniques.|$|R
40|$|Ducts can {{be found}} in {{ventilation}} systems, cooling <b>ducts</b> and <b>blade</b> passages of turbines, centrifugal pumps and many other engineering installations. The properties of the flow in ducts can significantly aﬀect the performance and eﬃciency of these installation areas. The majority of the flows in ducts and engineering applications are turbulent. The work presented in this thesis focuses on the analysis of turbulent flows inside square sectioned ducts and ducts with bends. The accuracy of three diﬀerent high resolution high order schemes in the context of Implicit Large Eddy Simulation (ILES) is analysed. The influence of a low Mach limiting technique, Low Mach Number Treatment (LMNT) is also studied. The schemes employed are Monotonic Upwind Scheme for Scalar Conservation Laws (MUSCL) with a 2 nd order Monotonized Central (MC) and 5 th order limiter, and a 9 th order Weighted Essential Non-Oscillatory (WENO) limiter. The first case studied is a duct of square cross section. In the absence of experimental data for the duct case, the data from a plain channel flow is used to shed light on the results. The flow analysis points out the generation of secondary motions created by the existence of surrounding walls. All schemes employed lead to a similarly developed turbulent flow that is used to provide the turbulent boundary profile for the following case. LMNT proves to significantly assist MUSCL 2 nd and 5 th, that use it, in providing a turbulent profile similar to that of WENO 9 th that did not employ the technique but is inherently less dissipative. The second case under study is that of a square sectioned duct with a 90 o bend. The simulation output is in good agreement both qualitatively and quantitatively with the experimental data available in the literature. The generation of secondary flows inside the bend is observed without flow separation. Although the turbulent flow entering the domain is almost the same for all cases, diﬀerences between the schemes are noticed especially after the middle of the bend. LMNT leads to an overprediction of turbulence after that area for both schemes employing it while WENO 9 th without LMNT provides the most accurate results compared to those provided by the experiment. The results demonstrate applicability of ILES to strongly confined flows with secondary motions and shed light on cognitive properties {{of a wide range of}} state of the art schemes.

Previous studies have shown, however, that efficiency benefits of Boundary Layer Ingesting (BLI) ingestion are very sensitive to the magnitude of fan and <b>duct</b> losses, and <b>blade</b> structural response to the non-uniform flow field that results from a BLI inlet has not been studied in-depth. This paper presents an effort to extend the modeling capabilities of an existing rotating turbomachinery unsteady analysis code to include the ability to solve the external and internal flow fields of a BLI inlet. The TURBO code has been a successful tool in evaluating fan response to flow distortions for traditional engine/inlet integrations, such as the development of rotating stall and inlet distortion through compressor stages. This paper describes the first phase of an effort to extend the TURBO model to calculate the external and inlet flowfield upstream of fan so that accurate pressure distortions that result from BLI configurations can be computed and used to analyze fan aerodynamics and structural response. To validate the TURBO program modifications for the BLI flowfield, experimental test data obtained by NASA for a flushmounted S-duct with large amounts of boundary layer ingestion was modeled. Results for the flow upstream and in the inlet are presented and compared to experimental data for several high Reynolds number flows to validate the modifications to the solver. Quantitative data is presented that indicates good predictive capability of the model in the upstream flow. A representative fan is attached to the inlet and results are presented for the coupled inlet/fan model.

The unsteady loads can cause propulsor blade damage, and also affect vehicle maneuverability. Crashback is therefore well {{known as one of the}} most challenging propeller states to analyze. This dissertation uses Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) to predict the highly unsteady flow field in crashback. A non-dissipative and robust finite volume method developed by Mahesh et al. (2004) for unstructured grids is applied to flow around marine propulsors. The LES equations are written in a rotating frame of reference. The objectives of this dissertation are: (1) to understand the flow physics of crashback in marine propulsors with and without a duct, (2) to develop a finite volume method for highly skewed meshes which usually occur in complex propulsor geometries, and (3) to develop a sliding interface method for simulations of rotor-stator propulsor on parallel platforms. LES is performed for an open propulsor in crashback and validated against experiments performed by Jessup et al. (2004). The LES results show good agreement with experiments. Effective pressures for thrust and side-force are introduced to more clearly understand the physical sources of thrust and side-force. Both thrust and side-force are seen to be mainly generated from the leading edge of the suction side of the propeller. This implies that thrust and side-force have the same source - the highly unsteady leading edge separation. Conditional averaging is performed to obtain quantitative information about the complex flow physics of high- or low- amplitude events. The events for thrust and side force show the same tendency. The conditional averages show that during high amplitude events, the vortex ring core is closer to the propeller blades, the reverse flow induced by the propeller rotation is lower, the forward flow is higher at the root of the blades, and leading and trailing edge flow separations are larger. The instantaneous flow field shows that during low amplitude events, the vortex ring is more axisymmetric and the stronger reverse flow induced by the vortex ring suppresses the forward flow so that flow separation on the blades is smaller. During high amplitude events, the vortex ring is less coherent and the weaker reverse flow cannot overcome the forward flow. The stronger forward flow makes flow separation on the blades larger. The effect of a duct on crashback is studied with LES. Thrust mostly arises from the blade surface, but most of side-force is generated from the duct surface. Both mean and RMS of pressure are much higher on inner surface of <b>duct,</b> especially near <b>blade</b> tips. This implies that side-force on the ducted propulsor is caused by the blade-duct interaction. Strong tip leakage flow is observed behind the suction side at the tip gap. The physical source of the tip leakage flow is seen to be the large pressure difference between pressure and suction sides. The conditional average for high amplitude event shows consistent results; the tip leakage flow and pressure difference are significantly higher when thrust and side-force are higher. A sliding interface method is developed to allow simulations of rotor-stator propulsor in crashback. The method allows relative rotations between different parts of the computational grid. Search algorithm for sliding elements, data structures for message passing, and accurate interpolation scheme at the sliding interface are developed for arbitrary shaped unstructured grids on parallel computing platforms. Preliminary simulations of open propulsor in crashback show reasonable performance...|$|R
