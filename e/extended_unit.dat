The final section delves into the ABCs of extended collocations in the context of lexicography, suggesting that dictionaries should make an effort to include a selection of such strings, especially for encoding tasks that are to be shown as examples of use. Most dictionaries incorporate very few such “loose” units, probably because of a powerful tradition to include as examples of use chiefly binary collocations and full sentences...|$|R

40|$|We study {{superconductivity}} on the honeycomb lattice {{close to}} the Mott state at half-filling. Due to the sixfold lattice symmetry and disjoint Fermi surfaces at opposite momenta, we show that several different fully gapped superconducting states naturally exist on the honeycomb lattice, of which the chiral d+id'-wave state has previously been shown to appear when superconductivity appears {{close to the}} Mott state. Using renormalized mean-field theory to study the t-J model and quantum Monte Carlo calculations of the Hubbard-U model we show that the d+id'-wave state is the favored superconducting state {{for a wide range}} of on-site repulsion U, from the intermediate to the strong coupling regime. We also investigate the possibility of a mixed chirality d-wave state, where the overall chirality cancels. We find that a state with d+id'-wave symmetry in one valley but d-id'-wave symmetry in the other valley is not possible in the t-J model without reducing the translational symmetry, due to the zero-momentum and spin-singlet nature of the superconducting order parameter. Moreover, any <b>extended</b> <b>unit</b> cells result either in disjoint Dirac points, which cannot harbor this mixed chirality state, or the two valleys are degenerate at the zone center, where valley hybridization prevents different superconducting condensates. We also investigate <b>extended</b> <b>unit</b> cells where the overall chirality cancels in real space. For supercells containing up to eight sites, including the Kekulé distortion, we find no energetically favorable d-wave solution with an overall zero chirality within the restriction of the t-J model.

40|$|This study {{offers a}} {{multilevel}} {{analysis of the}} form of the third movement of Mahler’s Second Symphony providing three frameworks (those of a sophisticated trio form, a bipartite idiosyncratic form, and an imaginary, ‘endless’ form). Conceiving of the formal dimensions of the Scherzo of Mahler’s Second Symphony as ontological models, I will contextualize these with reference to the writings of E. T. A. Hoffmann, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche. Among the new discoveries of this investigation, I will outline the implications of three hitherto neglected circumstances: first, the movement’s first <b>extended</b> <b>unit</b> itself constitutes a self-contained symphonic scherzo movement; next, the movement can be described as two succeeding permutations of the same set of thematic materials; finally, there is a crucial recurrence suggesting the infinitude of the form. Instead of creating an ill-conceived dichotomy between form as a secondary structure and the meaningful ‘narrative’ in negotiation with formal questions, I wish to regard form as a primary source of a work’s meaning. At the same time, I wish to regard {{the form of the}} movement as an efficient means of channelling its dialogue with the genre of scherzo. Listened to as a composer’s self-positioning in the field of the masters of symphony, the movement reveals Mahler’s successful attempt at breaking away from the Brucknerian model of scherzo and, at the same time, proudly parading his virtuosity in applying some elements of that model in a different context...|$|E
40|$|Semantic prosody is an {{important}} concept {{and has become a}} primary research interest in corpus linguistics. This thesis undertakes the groundwork of fundamental research into semantic prosody in Thai, a language which has not been subject to studies of semantic prosody before, to set out the parameters for subsequent research in this area. In particular, it addresses these three research questions: 1. What are {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the major approaches to semantic prosody proposed in the literature for describing semantic prosody in Thai? 2. What variation in semantic prosodies across genres can be identified for Thai words? 3. To what extent are the semantic prosodies of words identified as translation-equivalents in widely-used bilingual dictionaries in Thai and English similar or different? The datasets employed in the analysis are the Thai National Corpus and the British National Corpus. To address each research question, a small number of Thai words are selected for the analysis. Two primary approaches, the polarity-oriented approach and the EUM-oriented approach, are employed to identify semantic prosody. Within the polarity-oriented approach, which is founded in work by Louw, Stubbs, and Partington, semantic prosody is identified based on collocates, and is restricted to the positive vs. negative opposition. Within the EUM-oriented approach, which is based in the studies of Sinclair, semantic prosody is identified by examining concordance lines for a pragmatic function or meaning that is spread across an <b>extended</b> <b>unit</b> of meaning. The results of the analysis show that the two primary approaches to semantic prosody do operate successfully with the Thai data. A range of semantic prosodies are identified for /kreeŋcay/ ‘considerate’, /kɔ̀ ɔhâykə̀ ət/ ‘cause’, and /chɔ̂ɔp/ ‘like’, the objects under study, by the two approaches. The discussion of these semantic prosodies shows that the two approaches are useful for different purposes. The polarity-oriented approach is useful when one’s aim is to investigate a word’s tendency to co-occur with positive or negative words. Particularly, it reveals the hidden evaluative potential of words whose evaluation is not obvious from their core semantics. The EUM-oriented approach is, by contrast, suitable for the examination of an <b>extended</b> <b>unit</b> of meaning and its pragmatic function in the Sinclairian sense. They both also have some advantages and disadvantages in terms of practicality. On the issue of variation in semantic prosodies across genres, some variation is indeed found to exist. From the concordance analysis of 19 verbs, each in four different genres, namely academic writing, fiction, newspaper stories, and non-academic non-fiction, 21 different extended units of meaning are identified from 14 of the verbs. The level of variation in the use of these extended units of meaning across genres, which implies variation in semantic prosodies, is considerable with some extended units of meaning, but is limited with others. In particular, a notable contrast is identified between academic and fiction genres in terms of which extended units (and semantic prosodies) are common. Finally, the majority of the translationequivalent pairs under study (36 out of 48) show the same semantic prosody; of these, most present a neutral semantic prosody. In cases where the pairs show different semantic prosodies, there are not any cases where one word in the pair shows a positive semantic prosody, and the other shows a negative semantic prosody, and vice versa. It is thus arguable that there is a relationship between semantic prosody in Thai and English – not a genetic or areal relationship, but one that arises from a functional basis, that is, the meanings that the pairs of words under study express in both languages...|$|E
40|$|Isothermal ageing of plastically {{deformed}} Mg-Zn-Y alloys {{resulted in}} precipitation along 10 - 12 twin boundaries. The bulky precipitates formed had structures {{similar to those}} recently reported for the rod-like β' precipitates, but afforded a more detailed study by high resolution TEM due to their larger size. The core of the precipitates often had the structure of monoclinic Mg 4 Zn 7 phase, and had the orientation [0001]_Mg//[010]; 10 - 10 _Mg // (201) with either the matrix or the twin. On this Mg 4 Zn 7 phase, hexagonal MgZn 2 phase grew in two orientations, both with [010]_Mg 4 Zn 7 // [11 - 20]_MgZn 2. One of these orientations formed a known orientation relationship [0001]_Mg // [11 - 20]_MgZn 2; 11 - 20 _Mg // (0001) _MgZn 2 with the matrix. The part of the precipitate with the MgZn 2 structure was usually {{in direct contact with}} the twin boundary. Both Mg 4 Zn 7 and MgZn 2 phases have layered structures that can be described with similar building blocks of icosahedrally coordinated atoms. The atomic positions of zinc atoms comprise the vertices of these icosahedra and form "thick" rhombic tiles. Orientation of these rhombuses remain unchanged across the interfaces between the two phases. Near the interface with MgZn 2, transition structures formed in Mg 4 Zn 7 phase, with Zn:Mg atom ratio between those of Mg 4 Zn 7 and MgZn 2 phases. In these transition structures, the unit cell of Mg 4 Zn 7 phase is extended along [100] or [001] by half a unit cell length by continuation of the rhombic tiling.
