5|$|Over {{the next}} three days, around a million mourners {{came to see the}} body, many queuing <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> the {{freezing}} conditions. On 26 January, the eleventh All-Union Congress of Soviets met to pay respects to the deceased leader, with speeches being made by Kalinin, Zinoviev, and Stalin, but notably not Trotsky, who had been convalescing in the Caucasus. Lenin's funeral took place the following day, when his body was carried to Red Square, accompanied by martial music, where assembled crowds listened to a series of speeches before the corpse was placed into the vault of a specially erected mausoleum. Despite the freezing temperatures, tens of thousands attended.|$|E
5|$|No German {{team was}} allowed at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London or the Winter Games in St. Moritz. Brundage {{was anxious to}} reintegrate Germany into the Olympic {{movement}} once the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany, through Brundage's lifetime) was formed in 1949. Soon after the state's formation, its National Olympic Committee approached the IOC, seeking recognition, {{but there was still}} much animus towards Germany. Just prior to the IOC session in Vienna in 1951 (Brundage was still vice president), the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) also formed an NOC and requested recognition. This created controversy, as the Federal Republic and its NOC claimed to represent both West and East Germany, but did not control the latter. Despite lengthy discussions, no resolution was reached in 1951, and the matter was put over until February 1952, when a negotiating session was scheduled for Copenhagen. Although the East Germans came to Copenhagen, they refused to attend the session, which was eventually cancelled by Edström after the IOC officials and West Germans waited <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> vain. The German team which competed in Helsinki that summer was entirely West German.|$|E

25|$|One of Selleck's Magnum co-stars, Larry Manetti, in his 1996 memoir Aloha Magnum, was lavish in his {{praise of}} Selleck.

25|$|Solar cookers {{are less}} useful in cloudy weather {{and near the}} poles (where the sun is {{low in the sky}} or below the horizon), so an {{alternative}} cooking source is still required in these conditions. Solar cooking advocates suggest three devices for an integrated cooking solution: a) a solar cooker; b) a fuel-efficient cookstove; c) an insulated storage container such as a basket filled with straw to store heated food. Very hot food may continue to cook <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> a well-insulated container. With this three-part solution, fuel use is minimized while still providing hot meals at any hour, reliably.|$|E

Skillfully and patiently, he would stalk insects or other such creatures <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> the suburbs around New York City. Before beginning the hunt, he would lie {{for over an}} hour in the grass, rubbing himself with proximate flora to make himself smell less artificial. He would then gracefully swoop close to his prey and patiently frame the scene with an SLR equipped with an extension tube. He had even trained himself to hold his breath for up to two minutes, so that he could take his time and not disturb slowly exposing images.|$|E
25|$|As commandant of the American {{sector of}} Berlin from June 4, 1957 to December 15, 1959, Hamlett {{commanded}} a 4,000-man garrison {{in the southwest}} corner of West Berlin and was deputy chief of mission to Ambassador David K.E. Bruce in Bonn. His tour coincided with the 1958 Berlin crisis, which began when Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev issued an ultimatum demanding that the occupation of Berlin be terminated within six months. Tensions escalated as the Soviets began interfering with Western access to Berlin by detaining U.S. convoys on the autobahn <b>for</b> <b>hours.</b> <b>In</b> January 1959, Hamlett's own wife was halted by East German police while being driven in a U.S. Army car from East Berlin to West Berlin. The Western Allies presented a unified diplomatic and military front and the deadline passed without incident.|$|E

25|$|Katō {{reportedly}} did not {{get along}} well with his parents, and seldom returned home. An interview with Katō's brother revealed that his parents had put immense pressure on both of them to perform and to excel in their studies, ordering them to redo their homework to high standards in order to impress teachers in school, and recalled one incident when Katō was made to eat scraps of food from the floor. Another neighbour described Katō being punished by his parents, who made him stand outside <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> deep, cold snow during winter. Previous online postings before his announcement of the attack contained sharp criticisms of his own upbringing. Deeply in debt and believing that his family {{had given up on}} him, Katō unsuccessfully attempted suicide in 2006 by ramming his car into a wall.|$|E
25|$|Drigo was {{vacationing in}} his native Italy during the {{outbreak}} of World War I in 1914, which prevented him from returning to Russia for another two years. Soon after his arrival in Petrograd he was evicted from his home at the Grand Hotel, which was converted to offices for the newly established Soviet government. For a time Drigo was forced to live in considerable poverty in a camp {{with a group of}} his fellow Italian émigrés. He later recalled in his memoirs of the many cold evenings he spent with his close friend and colleague Alexander Glazunov waiting <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> bread lines and subsequently carrying their rations home through the snow on a sled. Upon his first engagement as conductor after his return to the former Imperial Mariinsky Theatre, Drigo received a fifteen-minute standing ovation from the audience.|$|E
500|$|Henry had a {{childhood}} stammer {{and was considered}} slow-witted {{and one of the}} less promising of the brilliant Beecher children. His less-than-stellar performance earned him punishments such as being forced to sit <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> the girls' corner wearing a dunce cap. At age fourteen, he began his oratorical training at Mount Pleasant Classical Institution, a boarding school in Amherst, Massachusetts, where he met a fellow student, Constantine Fondolaik, a Smyrna Greek.

Fondolaik died of cholera after returning to Greece in 1842, and Beecher later named his third son after him.|$|E

500|$|Blink-182 {{was formed}} in Poway, California, a suburb outside of San Diego, in August 1992. Guitarist Tom DeLonge was {{expelled}} from Poway High for attending a basketball game drunk {{and was forced to}} attend another local school for one semester. At Rancho Bernardo High School, DeLonge performed at a Battle of the Bands competition, where he was introduced to drummer Scott Raynor. He also befriended Kerry Key, who too was interested in punk music. Key's girlfriend, Anne Hoppus, introduced her brother, bassist Mark Hoppus—who had recently moved from Ridgecrest to work at a record store and attend college—to DeLonge on August 1, 1992. The two clicked instantly and played <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> DeLonge's garage, exchanging lyrics and co-writing songs—one of which became [...] "Carousel". Hoppus, in trying to impress Delonge, managed to fall from a lamppost in front of DeLonge's garage and crack his ankles, an injury that put him in crutches for three weeks.|$|E

DeLonge recruited friend Scott Raynor for drums, whom he met at a Rancho Bernado Battle of the Bands competition.

500|$|On {{the first}} day only 7,669 Allied {{soldiers}} were evacuated, {{but by the end}} of the eighth day, 338,226 of them had been rescued by a hastily assembled fleet of over 800 boats.
