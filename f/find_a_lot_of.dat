25|$|Six of the Cázares men, Rodolfo Cázares Garza, Manuel Alberto Cázares Garza, Héctor Cázares Garza, Rodolfo Ignacio Cázares Solís, Rubén Luna Mendoza, and Rodolfo Garza Solís, {{were kept}} together. The women and children, {{along with one}} of the grandfathers, were kept in a {{separate}} vehicle throughout most of the first day. After leaving the house, the captors drove them around the city for several hours and switched them into different vehicles on busy streets in broad daylight. The kidnappers drove several of the vehicles they took from the family's homes. According to one family member, the kidnappers even stopped for gas and did not pay for the service. In their portable radio conversations while driving, the family heard them speaking about avoiding Los Zetas, the rival crime syndicate of the Gulf Cartel. That evening, the women were taken to a hostage safe house where at least twenty other men were drinking and smoking cannabis. The windows in this disclosed location were covered. A shootout broke out near the premises and the victims were transported to another location in another SUV (while in the vehicle, the family was blindfolded and placed next to a corpse). The Cázares had the impression that they kidnappers were looking where to hide their victims. The family believes that the kidnappers moved them around Matamoros for hours because they did not expect to <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> people in the houses where they carried out the abductions.|$|E

500|$|As Public Works Minister, Cushing was {{a primary}} {{advocate}} of government {{intervention in the}} labour disputes plaguing Alberta's coal industry in 1907; Rutherford eventually appointed a commission to examine the problem. [...] Cushing also presided over the government's entry into the telephone business: in 1906, most telephone lines in Alberta were privately owned, and the largest of these private owners was the Bell Telephone Company. [...] Bell controlled all telephone service in Calgary, and refused to extend its operations into less densely populated, and therefore less profitable, regions of the province. [...] In response, Cushing attacked Bell as [...] "the most pernicious and iniquitous monopoly that had ever been foisted upon a people claiming to be free" [...] and sponsored legislation creating Alberta Government Telephones to service areas that Bell would not. [...] This new company later purchased Bell's lines, financing the venture by issuing debentures, {{in contrast to the}} government's usual policy of [...] "pay as you go". [...] Cushing's zeal for government involvement was such that member of the Canadian House of Commons Peter Talbot in 1908 warned Rutherford that his Public Works Minister was [...] "going crazy" [...] with public ownership and that Rutherford would [...] "someday <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> trouble through him". [...] Thomas has argued that it was strange for a successful businessman like Cushing to be so aggressive rhetorically against a successful corporation, but Mount Royal College historian Patricia Roome has suggested that Cushing was soured by his own experience as a Calgarian living under the monopoly, hostile to what he saw as a symbol of [...] "eastern capitalism", and hopeful that bringing telephone service to rural areas would guarantee continued Liberal success.|$|E

He thought {{that all of the}} game's systems intertwined with each other, and ultimately made the game a complete and worthwhile experience. Reiner echoed similar thoughts, and considered getting around Sunset City fun for players. He added that the traversal system increased the game's replay value. However, he was disappointed by the game's occasionally repetitive mission design. Sliva and Brown shared similar thoughts, with the latter saying that the game featured too many fetch quests. Patterson disliked the game's traversal; he found that the system was frustrating at times. However, he thought that this problem [...] lessened as players unlocked new moves and skills. Gies felt overwhelmed by the traversal options. He added that Insomniac had successfully created a system that was accessible for ordinary players, while creating challenges {{for those who want to}} master the system. However, he noted the camera system may not able to track the movement of the character accurately. He further commended the game's world design, and described it as one of the most [...] "navigationally sophisticated" [...] worlds he had ever experienced in a game. [...] Bischoff considered the shooting mechanic [...] "loose", but thought that the problem was overshadowed by the game's forgiving aiming and steady difficulty curve.
