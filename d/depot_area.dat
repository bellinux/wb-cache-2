5|$|Lieutenant-General Arthur Percival, General Officer Commanding of HQ Malaya Command, drew a defence {{perimeter}} covering Kallang Airfield, the MacRitchie and Peirce reservoirs and the Bukit Timah supply <b>depot</b> <b>area</b> {{to ensure}} {{the integrity of the}} city's defence. One line of the north-western defence perimeter was the Jurong-Kranji defence line, a narrow ridge connecting the sources of Sungei Jurong and the Kranji River, forming a natural defence line protecting the north-west approach to the Singapore Town. (Its counterpart was the Serangoon Line, which was sited between Kallang Airfield and Paya Lebar village {{in the eastern part of}} Singapore). The troops were to defend this Line strongly against the invading Japanese force. The Line was defended by the 44th Indian Infantry Brigade which covered milestone 12 on Jurong Road, the 12th Indian Infantry Brigade and the reinforced 22nd Australian Brigade which guarded the northern part of the Line and maintained contact with the 44th Indian Brigade. The 15th Indian Infantry Brigade was re-positioned near Bukit Timah Road to guard the island's vital food and petrol supplies. A secret instruction to protect this area was issued to Percival's generals.|$|E
25|$|The Depot District, {{an area of}} {{the city}} {{dedicated}} to music and nightlife located in the old railroad <b>depot</b> <b>area,</b> boasts a number of theatres, upscale restaurants, and cultural attractions. The Depot District is also home to several shops, pubs and nightclubs, a radio station, a magazine, a winery, a salon, and other establishments. Many of the buildings were remodeled from the original Fort Worth & Denver South Plains Railway Depot which originally stood on the site. The Buddy Holly Center, a museum highlighting the life and music of Buddy Holly, is also located in the Depot District, as is the restored community facility, the Cactus Theater.|$|E

5000|$|Symbolism: Scarlet {{and white}} are the colors {{used for the}} Engineers, the {{original}} unit designation. The penta-foil refers to the five component elements of the Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, Engineer Battalion (Depot).

2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1935, the first {{transport}} squadrons, including the 3d Transport Squadron at Duncan Field, Texas, were made regular units and activated with Bellanca C-27 Airbus aircraft assigned. [...] With enlisted men as pilots, the squadron hauled engines, parts, and other equipment to airfields in their assigned <b>depot</b> <b>area,</b> returned items to the depot, and transferred materiel between depots. They also furnished transportation for maneuvers. [...] The rapid transport of supplies by the squadrons permitted the Air Corps to maintain low levels of materiel at its airfields, relying on replenishment from depot stocks only when needed.|$|E
2500|$|A {{fundamental}} {{renovation of}} the station complex began in 2006. As it had been foreseen that, following {{the completion of the}} Lötschberg Base Tunnel, the majority of the passengers would change in Visp for trains to Zermatt, the narrow gauge and standard gauge tracks were relocated closer together. Ever since then, three platforms have been available to MGB trains. Narrow gauge track 3 is located immediately adjacent to the new standard gauge track 4. The station building and the entire BVZ <b>depot</b> <b>area</b> were demolished in parallel. [...] All subsequent maintenance of railway vehicles has been carried out exclusively in the Glisergrund workshop. The ceremonial opening of the new junction station took place on 16 and 17 May 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Tweetsie Railroad {{became a}} popular tourist attraction, and quickly {{evolved into the}} first theme park in North Carolina -- {{and one of the}} first in the nation. A western town and saloon were built around the {{original}} <b>depot</b> <b>area.</b> [...] A train robbery and cowboy-and-Indian show were added to the train ride, playing off the Wild West theme that was very popular at the time on television and in movies. The theme was enhanced by regular visits from Charlotte's WBTV television personality/singing cowboy Fred Kirby, who hosted a popular children’s show. [...] In 1961, a chairlift and amusement ride area was constructed on the central mountain inside the rail loop, and over the decades the park has been expanded with additional rides, attractions, shops, zoo, and restaurants.|$|E
5000|$|On 9 March 1942, the Air Service Command now {{became one}} of the major AAF commands, with {{relatively}} clear lines of responsibilityand authority. Four air service area commands (San Antonio, Fairfield, Middletown, and Sacramento?), successors to the maintenance wings (and field service sections, originally activated in 1940?), had been activated in December 1941 to supervise the depots in given geographical <b>areas.</b> The <b>depots,</b> of which there were eleven by April 1942, became the centers of <b>depot</b> control <b>areas,</b> which directed the activities of subdepots within defined geographical limits. Unfortunately, the boundaries of some of the <b>depot</b> control <b>areas</b> overlapped those of air service areas, and since the depots were the real focal points of supply and maintenance activities, the air service areas never attained the status of fully functioning ASC subcommands. The air service areas were disbanded on 1 February 1943, to be succeeded by air <b>depot</b> control <b>area</b> commands, which were simply the eleven former <b>depot</b> control <b>areas</b> under a new name. The elimination of the four air service areas was apparently justified by subsequent operations; according to Maj. Gen. Walter H. Frank, commander of the ASC, the step proved [...] "most beneficial." ...|$|R

2500|$|Although most of {{the wing}} squadrons flew the Douglas C-47 Skytrain, the 320th Transport Squadron of its 27th group was {{equipped}} with Noorduyn UC-64 Norseman aircraft for medical evacuation missions. [...] In February 1945, the wing began to ferry aircraft as well. Ferrying aircraft {{had been part of}} the mission of the wing's groups prior to their assignment to the wing, but when the wing assumed command of the two groups, Base Air <b>Depot</b> <b>Area</b> took over management of aircraft ferrying, although using crews from the 302d. [...] Aircraft ferried included Boeing B-17 Flying Fortressess, Consolidated B-24 Liberators, Martin B-26 Marauders, Douglas A-20 Havocs, North American P-51 Mustangs, Consolidated C-109 Liberator Expresses, and numerous other models within the European theater of operations. [...] In total, over 85 types of aircraft were flown by the wing's 310th Ferrying Squadron.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1944, the group was {{transferred}} to the 302d Transport Wing along with the 31st Transport Group of Ninth Air Force. [...] It lost its group commander, Col. Arnold, and most of its staff to the new wing. [...] The group began to taper off its operations in the United Kingdom and transfer its operations to the continent of Europe, although the 325th squadron remained in the United Kingdom to operate its ferrying detachments. [...] The group's squadrons, which had been spread over several bases in the United Kingdom, assembled at RAF Grove and moved in sequence to Le Bourget Airport. near Paris. France, led by the 320th Transport Squadron. [...] In November, one of the group's original squadrons, the 87th was transferred from the group to the Base Air <b>Depot</b> <b>Area.</b> [...] The 87th was heavily involved in transporting fuel to General Patton's rapidly advancing Third Army.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, we will mainly {{deal with}} {{rail-road}} combined transport or ferroutage, {{in which the}} main distance is covered by rail, and the road solution is only adopted for pre- and post-haulage (also called drayage 1). The rail-road transport we refer to is unaccompanied, and the driver therefore does not follow the goods along the path covered by the alternative mode. A modal shift is carried out by using suitable handling equipment in specific nodes of the transport network, i.e. inland terminals (sometimes called freight stations, that is, when <b>depot</b> <b>areas</b> are included), {{which may or may}} not be matched with a freight village or a logistics centre [3].|$|R
