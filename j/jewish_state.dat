5|$|At {{a meeting}} on 29 November, the United Nations General Assembly decided to end the British Mandate on 1August1948. Palestine would be {{partitioned}} into separate Arab and Jewish states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. The <b>Jewish</b> <b>state</b> would have fifty-six per cent of the land {{with a population of}} 490,000Jews and 325,000Arabs, while the Arab state would have 807,000Arabs, but only 10,000Jews. The population of Jerusalem would be around 105,000Arabs to 100,000Jews.|$|E

5|$|The British mandate in Palestine, {{where an}} Arab {{majority}} lived alongside a Jewish minority, presented the British {{with a similar}} problem to that of India. The matter was complicated by large numbers of Jewish refugees seeking {{to be admitted to}} Palestine following the Holocaust, while Arabs were opposed {{to the creation of a}} <b>Jewish</b> <b>state.</b> Frustrated by the intractability of the problem, attacks by Jewish paramilitary organisations and the increasing cost of maintaining its military presence, Britain announced in 1947 that it would withdraw in 1948 and leave the matter to the United Nations to solve. The UN General Assembly subsequently voted for a plan to partition Palestine into a Jewish and an Arab state.|$|E
5|$|The British were {{formally}} {{awarded the}} mandate {{to govern the}} region in 1922. The non-Jewish Palestinians revolted in 1920, 1929, and 1936. In 1947, following World War II and The Holocaust, the British Government announced its desire to terminate the Mandate, and the United Nations General Assembly adopted in November 1947 a Resolution 181(II) recommending partition into an Arab state, a <b>Jewish</b> <b>state</b> and the Special International Regime for the City of Jerusalem. The Jewish leadership accepted the proposal, but the Arab Higher Committee rejected it; a civil war began immediately after the Resolution's adoption. The State of Israel was declared in May 1948.|$|E
5|$|Quwatli {{opposed the}} {{proposed}} partition of the British Mandate of Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states, {{arguing that the}} plan, which would allocate 56% of Palestine to the <b>Jewish</b> <b>state,</b> violated {{the rights of the}} Palestinian Arab majority. The proposal passed the UN vote and Syria made war preparations soon afterward, including co-founding the Arab Liberation Army (ALA). Quwatli had proposed the creation of the ALA as a volunteer force to attract fighters from throughout the Arab world and {{to take the place of}} Arab regular armies. The ALA's establishment was sponsored by the Arab League following the UN partition vote and Fawzi al-Qawuqji, a Syrian commander who played leading roles in the Great Syrian Revolt and the 1936 revolt in Palestine, was appointed its commander. Quwatli did not believe the armies of Syria and the Arab world were ready to successfully confront Jewish forces and as war drew near in early 1948, he petitioned Abdel Rahman Azzam, head of the Arab League, to not enter Arab armies into Palestine. Instead, Quwatli offered to provide local Palestinian Arab fighters arms and funding. Azzam was not swayed and continued his effort of rallying Arab governments to dispatch their armies. On 15 May, after the establishment of Israel was announced, Quwatli ordered the Syrian Army to enter Palestine immediately.|$|E

25|$|Upon the {{implementation}} of the truce, the IDF had control over nine Arab cities and towns or mixed cities and towns: New Jerusalem, Jaffa, Haifa, Acre, Safed, Tiberias, Baysan (Beit She'an), Samakh and Yibna (Yavne). Another city, Jenin, was not occupied but its residents fled. The combined Arab forces captured 14 Jewish settlement points, but only one of them, Mishmar HaYarden, was in the territory of the proposed <b>Jewish</b> <b>State</b> according to Resolution 181. Within the boundaries of the proposed <b>Jewish</b> <b>state,</b> there were twelve Arab villages which opposed Jewish control or were captured by the invading Arab armies, and in addition to them, the Lod Airport and pumping station near Antipatris, which were within the boundaries of the proposed <b>Jewish</b> <b>state,</b> were {{under the control of the}} Arabs. The IDF captured about 50 large Arab villages outside of the boundaries of the proposed <b>Jewish</b> <b>State</b> and a larger number of hamlets and Bedouin encampments. 350 square kilometers of the proposed <b>Jewish</b> <b>State</b> were under the control of the Arab forces, while 700 square kilometers of the proposed Arab State were under the control of the IDF. This figure ignors the Negev desert which wasn't under any absolute control of either side.|$|E
25|$|While Fackenheim's sentiments {{about the}} need for Jewish {{self-reliance}} {{in the form of a}} <b>Jewish</b> <b>state</b> are immensely popular, Fackenheim fails to locate a religious or divine source for his moral imperative.

25|$|In 1947, {{following}} increasing {{levels of}} violence, the British government decided {{to withdraw from}} Mandatory Palestine.

25|$|The land {{allocated}} to the Arab State in the final plan included about 43% of Mandatory Palestine and consisted {{of all of the}} highlands, except for Jerusalem, plus one-third of the coastline. The highlands contain the major aquifers of Palestine, which supplied water to the coastal cities of central Palestine, including Tel Aviv. The <b>Jewish</b> <b>State</b> was to receive 56% of Mandatory Palestine, a slightly larger area to accommodate the increasing numbers of Jews who would immigrate there. The <b>Jewish</b> <b>State</b> included three fertile lowland plains – the Sharon on the coast, the Jezreel Valley and the upper Jordan Valley. The bulk of the proposed Jewish State's territory, however, consisted of the Negev Desert. The desert was not suitable for agriculture, nor for urban development at that time. The <b>Jewish</b> <b>State</b> would also be given sole access to the Red Sea.|$|E

25|$|His {{new party}} {{demanded that the}} {{mainstream}} Zionist movement recognize as its stated objective {{the establishment of a}} <b>Jewish</b> <b>state</b> on both banks of the Jordan River.

His philosophy contrasted with that of the socialist oriented Labor Zionists, in that it focused its economic and social policy on the ideals of the Jewish middle class in Europe. His ideal for a <b>Jewish</b> <b>state</b> was a form of nation state based loosely on the British imperial model. His support base was mostly located in Poland, and his activities focused on attaining British support to help with the development of the Yishuv. Another area of major support for Jabotinsky was Latvia, where his speeches in Russian made an impression on the largely Russian-speaking Latvian Jewish community.|$|E
