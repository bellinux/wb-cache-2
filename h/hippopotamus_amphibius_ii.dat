50|$|Hippopotamus is a genus of {{artiodactyl}} mammal {{consisting of}} one extant species, <b>Hippopotamus</b> <b>amphibius,</b> {{also known as}} the hippopotamus, and several extinct species. It belongs to the family Hippopotamidae, which also includes the pygmy hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis) and a number of extinct genera.|$|R
50|$|The Allenton Hippo is a {{substantive}} <b>hippopotamus</b> (<b>Hippopotamus</b> <b>amphibius)</b> skeleton {{that was found}} in Allenton, Derby, England, in 1895. The skeleton is exhibited in Derby Museum and Art Gallery and is 3 m in length. It is celebrated today in a sculpture near to where the skeleton was discovered.|$|R
50|$|The semiaquatic <b>hippopotamus</b> (<b>Hippopotamus</b> <b>amphibius)</b> is the {{heaviest}} living even-toed ungulate, mean adult weight is around 1,500 kg (3,300 lb) and 1,300 kg (2,900 lb) {{for males and}} females respectively. It and the critically endangered pygmy hippo (Choeropsis liberiensis) are believed to be the closest extant relatives of cetaceans. Hippos are among the megafaunal species most dangerous to humans.|$|R
50|$|There {{were once}} {{many species of}} hippopotamid, but only two survive today: <b>Hippopotamus</b> <b>amphibius,</b> and Choeropsis liberiensis. They are the last {{survivors}} of two major evolutionary lineages, the hippos proper and the pygmy hippos, respectively; these lineages could arguably be considered subfamilies, but their relationship to each other - apart from being fairly distant relatives - is not well resolved.|$|R
5000|$|Similar in {{size and}} form to Hippopotamus gorgops, H. antiquus on average was larger than the modern common <b>hippopotamus</b> (<b>Hippopotamus</b> <b>amphibius).</b> H. antiquus is {{believed}} to have first appeared around 1.8 million years ago, compared to 2 million years ago for H. amphibius. Beginning in the Middle Pleistocene, H. amphibius migrated into Europe and may have competed with this hippopotamus species for food.|$|R
40|$|Presents a {{study that}} {{developed}} a polymerase chain reaction-based method for {{the identification of the}} sex of the <b>Hippopotamus</b> <b>amphibius.</b> Identification of the sex of aquatic mammals such as the <b>hippopotamus</b> (<b>Hippopotamus</b> <b>amphibius)</b> is difficult in the field. We have developed a PCR-based method for sex identification in the hippopotamus. This method amplifies a short fragment of the ZFX [zinc finger protein, X-linked] and ZFY [zinc finger protein, Y-linked] genes from the X and Y chromosomes. The PCR products are then digested with the restriction endonuclease HaeIII. The method was verified using tissue samples taken from six captive animals in zoos. We then collected 54 tissue samples from free-ranging hippos in Kruger National Park, South Africa, using a biopsy dart and cross-bow. The PCR method correctly identified the sex of all individuals for whom the sex was known (either zoo animals, or those exhibiting clear behaviours or morphologies in the field). Field identification of the sex of other individuals was prone to error (6 of 22 misidentified, 27 %) ...|$|R
25|$|Gaurs {{are among}} the largest living land animals. Only elephants, rhinos, the <b>hippopotamus</b> (<b>Hippopotamus</b> <b>amphibius)</b> and the giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) {{consistently}} grow heavier. Two species that naturally co-exist with the gaur are heavier: the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) and Indian rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis). By most standards of measurements, gaur is the largest wild bovid alive today. However, the shorter-legged, bulkier wild water buffalo (Bubalus arnee) is similar in average body mass, if not maximum weight.|$|R
50|$|Its shores and {{waters are}} favored by birds, such as cranes, herons, pelicans, African jacanas, egrets and waders, which find {{excellent}} feeding over the large spaces near the extremities and shore line of bays. These {{are covered with}} close-packed growths of Pistia stratiotes rigl plants. Kobus ellipsiprymnus and <b>Hippopotamus</b> <b>amphibius</b> frequent the area. There are armies of black mosquitoes. Lake fish were infested with guinea worm {{at the time of}} Stanley's expedition.|$|R
50|$|The {{origins of}} this genus remain unclear. For many {{years it was}} {{believed}} that this genus had an African origin, but DNA sequencing suggests that the species (S. edwardiense and S. hippopotami) that infect the hippo (<b>Hippopotamus</b> <b>amphibius)</b> could be basal. Since hippos were present in both Africa and Asia during the Cenozoic era the genus might have originated as parasites of hippos. The original hosts for the South East Asian species were probably rodents.|$|R

50|$|Mammals {{found here}} include: African bush {{elephant}} (loxodonta Africana) found widely in savannas, deserts, rainforest, {{and in the}} national parks; <b>hippopotamus</b> (<b>Hippopotamus</b> <b>amphibius)</b> found in rivers of both parks; the African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) an ox like animal in large herds in savannas and in smaller groups in parks; warthog (Phacochoerus africanus) in both parks; the aardwark (Orycteropus afer) insectivore found in savannas; pangolins; hedgehogs; porcupine species; rock hyrax (Procavia capensis); Cape ground squirrel (Xerus inauris).|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} common {{chimpanzee}} (Pan troglodytes verus), River Gambia National Park {{is also home to}} the Guinea baboon (Papio papio), green monkey (Chlorocebus sabaeus), western red colobus (Piliocolobus badius), and marmosets (Callithrix). Other mammals include the prolific warthog (Phacochoerus africanus) and some hippopotamuses (<b>Hippopotamus</b> <b>amphibius),</b> which have become rare in the Gambia. In addition, the park is home to the aardvark (Orycteropus afer senegalensis), honey badger (Mellivora capensis), serval (Leptailurus serval brachyura), Haussa genet (Genetta thierryi), African clawless otter (Aonyx capensis), and West African manatee (Trichechus senegalensis).|$|R
40|$|Tetanus in a {{free-living}} <b>hippopotamus</b> (<b>Hippopotamus</b> <b>amphibius)</b> {{from the}} Kruger National Park is described. The animal exhibited the classical tetanus symptomatology, {{the most salient}} clinical features being trauma (skin wounds) associated with exaggerated response of voluntary muscles to trivial stimuli, muscular spasms, general muscular rigidity, trismus, prolapsed third eye-lid and the preservation of consciousness. It is conjectured that the hippo's semi-aquatic way of life with its close proximity to dung-polluted water and an innate intraspecific aggression amongst males which often leads to fighting and trauma, should provide ample opportunity for infection with Clostridium tetani...|$|R
50|$|The pygmy hippo is reclusive and nocturnal. It {{is one of}} {{only two}} extant species in the family Hippopotamidae, the other being its much larger relative, the common <b>hippopotamus</b> (<b>Hippopotamus</b> <b>amphibius).</b> The pygmy <b>hippopotamus</b> {{displays}} many terrestrial adaptations, but like the hippo, it is semiaquatic and relies on water to keep its skin moist and its body temperature cool. Behaviors such as mating and giving birth may occur in water or on land. The pygmy hippo is herbivorous, feeding on ferns, broad-leaved plants, grasses, and fruits it finds in the forests.|$|R
50|$|The faunal species {{reported}} are 163 {{species of}} vertebrates, 52 species of reptiles, 56 species of amphibians and 215 fish species. It is {{also reported that}} at high altitudes, endemicity is distinct in 17 species of mammals and 22 species of birds. Lake Tanganyika has 200 species of fish and {{an equal number of}} molluscs. A scientific exploration team of the University of Texas at El Paso found the Bururi long-fingered frog (Cardioglossa cyaneospila) (considered extinct for decades), in December 2011 in the Bururi Forest Nature Reserve, after it was last seen in 1949. Seven important species of fauna reported are Genetta piscivora (aquatic genet), Serinus mozambicus (yellow-fronted canary), Cercopithecus lhoesti (L'hoest's monkey), Agapornis fischeri (Fischer's lovebird), Galago moholi (South African galago), Hyperolius viridiflavus, and <b>Hippopotamus</b> <b>amphibius</b> (<b>hippopotamus).</b>|$|R
50|$|The West African manatee (Trichechus senegalensis) is {{the most}} {{prominent}} fauna species in the lake which is reported as its last habitat in the world. Hippos (<b>Hippopotamus</b> <b>amphibius)</b> are also reported from the lake (the hippo population is estimated at 40 to 60 individuals). Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) is also reported from the flood plains. Within the basin area {{of the lake and}} the delta the faunal species reported are: roan antelope (Hippotragus equinus), dorcas gazelle (Gazella dorcas), dama gazelle (Gazella dama), red-fronted gazelle(Gazella rufifrons) (VU), and reptile species Nile monitor (Varanus nilotica) and African rock python (Python sebae).|$|R
50|$|Other {{large mammals}} {{found in the}} {{ecoregion}} include <b>hippopotamus</b> (<b>Hippopotamus</b> <b>amphibius),</b> zebra (Equus burchellii), and their predators such as lion (Panthera leo), leopard (P. pardus), cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus), African wild dog (Lycaon pictus), side-striped jackal (Canis adustus) and spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta) as well as smaller carnivores such as wild cat (Felis sylvestris), serval (F. serval), caracal (F. caracal) and, appropriately the Angolan genet (Genetta angolensis). Before the Angolan Civil War in the 1970s the area was home to large populations of elephants and black rhinoceros but these have almost completely been removed, mainly by poachers.|$|R
50|$|Whippomorpha is the clade {{containing}} the Cetacea (whales, dolphins, etc.) and their closest living relatives, the hippopotamuses, named by Waddell et al. (1999). It {{is defined as}} a crown group, including all species that are descendants of the most recent common ancestor of <b>Hippopotamus</b> <b>amphibius</b> and Tursiops truncatus. This would be a sub-grouping of the Cetartiodactyla (which also includes pigs and ruminants). It is not clear how recently whales and hippos share a common ancestor, though the genetic evidence is strong that the cetaceans arose from within the Artiodactyla, thus making the even-toed ungulate grouping a paraphyletic one.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION The fossil {{remains of}} Hippopotamus from the Pleistocene "Elandsfontein" site near Hopefield, Cape Province, {{have already been}} briefly {{described}} by Singer and Keen (1955), who found that the material {{available at the time}} was not different from the living <b>Hippopotamus</b> <b>amphibius</b> L. However, it seems worthwhile to review their status since the Hippopotamus material has been considerably increased as a result of recent collecting trips to the site. Not only are there now cranial remains, but also postcranial material, notably carpals, tarsals and metapodials. The purpose of the present note is to place on record all the material at present in the Hopefield collection pertaining to the species in question. The specimens, originally housed in the Anatomy Department, University of Cape Town, have now been transferred to the South African Museum, Cape Town. The specimens' numbers refer to the Hopefield collection catalogue.

DESCRIPTION OF SKULL AND DENTAL REMAINS The best preserved cranial remains of the hippopotamus in the Hopefield collection are two posterior parts of skulls, both broken off in front of the orbits (the fragments composing the first skull are numbered 1259, 1263, 1264, 4061, 5909, 5925, 5940, 5951, 5966, 5968, and 6021; the fragments of the second specimen bear the following numbers: 5903, 5904, 5908, 5911, 5913, 5914, 5915, 5917, 5919, 5920, 5921, 5923, 5932, 5933, 5935, 5939...|$|R
500|$|The common <b>hippopotamus</b> (<b>Hippopotamus</b> <b>amphibius),</b> or hippo, is a large, mostly herbivorous, {{semi-aquatic}} mammal {{native to}} sub-Saharan Africa, {{and one of}} only two extant species in the family Hippopotamidae, the other being the pygmy hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis or Hexaprotodon liberiensis). [...] The name comes from the ancient Greek for [...] "river horse" [...] (...) [...] After the elephant and rhinoceros, the common hippopotamus is the third-largest type of land mammal and the heaviest extant artiodactyl.

40|$|Although the sister-group {{relationship}} between Cetacea and Artiodactyla is widely accepted, the actual artiodactyl group which {{is closest to}} Cetacea has not been conclusively identi¢ed. In the present study, we have sequenced the complete mitochondrial genome of the <b>hippopotamus,</b> <b>Hippopotamus</b> <b>amphibius,</b> and included it in phylogenetic analyses together with 15 other placental mammals. These analyses separated the hippopotamus from the other suiform included, the pig, and identi¢ed the hippopotamus as the artio-dactyl sister group of the cetaceans, thereby making both Artiodactyla and the suborder Suiformes paraphyletic. The divergence between the hippopotamid and cetacean lineages was calculated using this molecular data and was estimated at ca. 54 MaBP...|$|R
50|$|The {{botanical garden}} {{contains}} {{many species of}} rare and valuable plants, {{some of which are}} not native to Vietnam. There are species of cacti, ferns and plants that have been imported from Africa and America. The zoo has many kinds of mammals, reptiles, and birds such as: monkeys, Indochinese tigers, white Bengal tigers, Clouded Leopards, African lions, gibbons, deer, elephants, turtles and snakes. Besides native animal species, there are also many exotic species, some of which are seen in Vietnam for the first time, such as: <b>Hippopotamus</b> <b>amphibius,</b> Choeropsis liberiensis, Panthera onca, Struthio camelus, Phoenicopterus ruber. There are lakes with contain different types of lotuses and a myriad of fish species.|$|R
50|$|Water {{flows into}} the lake from the Mau Hills and Tugen Hills. It is a {{critical}} habitat and refuge for more than 500 species of birds and fauna, some of the migratory waterbird species being significant regionally and globally. The lake also provides an invaluable habitat for seven fresh water fish species. One, Oreochromis niloticus baringoensis (a Nile tilapia subspecies), is endemic to the lake. Lake fishing is important to local social and economic development. Additionally the area is a habitat for many species of animals including the <b>hippopotamus</b> (<b>Hippopotamus</b> <b>amphibius),</b> Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) and many other mammals, amphibians, reptiles and the invertebrate communities.|$|R
50|$|Hippopotamus behemoth is an {{extinct species}} of {{hippopotamus}} from the Early Pleistocene of the Levant. Fossils of it, the modern <b>hippopotamus</b> H. <b>amphibius,</b> and its probable ancestor, H. gorgops, {{are found in}} the ‘Ubeidiya site in the southern Levant.|$|R
50|$|The {{topographic}} and {{climatic conditions}} {{of the country has}} resulted in faunal species dominated by rare species such as African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), striped hyena, Northwest African cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus hecki), waterbuck, African leopard (Panthera pardus pardus), West African lion (Panthera leo senegalensis), antelope, common warthog (Phacochoerus africanus), scimitar oryx (Oryx dammah), hippopotamuses (<b>Hippopotamus</b> <b>amphibius)</b> in the Niger River, crocodiles, horned vipers, lizards, pythons, manatee, the endemic Nigerian giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis peralta) which is endangered, the Critically Endangered dama gazelle, which is the national symbol of Niger (named meyna or ménas in the Hausa language) as well as Soemmerring's gazelle (Nanger soemmerringii), Grant's gazelle (Nanger granti) and slender-horned gazelle (Gazella leptoceros).|$|R
40|$|A new Pleistocene {{vertebrate}} assemblage from fluvial {{deposits of}} the River Severn in Gloucester, England, has yielded {{the remains of}} <b>hippopotamus</b> (<b>Hippopotamus</b> <b>amphibius),</b> a new record for this terrace system, with additional material from probable bison (cf. Bison priscus) and elephant (Elephantidae sp.). The presence of these taxa indicates fully temperate climatic conditions and the occurrence of hippopotamus, a significant biostratigraphical indicator for the British Late Pleistocene, suggests an age for the assemblage within Marine Oxygen Isotope Stage (MIS) 5 e (the Last Interglacial). This would contradict the older MIS 7 - 6 age for the gravel body that is currently accepted {{on the basis of}} deposit mapping and imply a more complex mode of deposition than presently envisaged in the valley...|$|R
