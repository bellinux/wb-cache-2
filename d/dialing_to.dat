25|$|In the UK, {{letters were}} {{assigned}} to numbers {{in a similar fashion}} to North America, except that the letter O was allocated to the digit 0 (zero); digit 6 had only M and N. The letter Q was later added to the zero position on British dials, in anticipation of direct international <b>dialing</b> <b>to</b> Paris, which commenced in 1963. This was necessary because French dials already had Q on the zero position, and there were exchange names in the Paris region which contained the letter Q.|$|E
2500|$|Actress Bebe Neuwirth left Cheers {{for fear}} of {{becoming}} typecast and to do theatre (mostly Broadway); she {{did not expect to}} appear recurrently in Frasier. Cheers and Frasier writers Ken Levine and David Isaacs found chemistry of Frasier and Lilith [...] "special" [...] enough to compare them with Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy on Prozac. In [...] "The Show Where Lilith Comes Back" [...] (1994), Lilith surprises Frasier by <b>dialing</b> <b>to</b> the radio show. They later make love in a hotel room, but end up regretting it, prompting them to part ways again. They decide to remain friends and help each other raise their son Frederick (Trevor Einhorn), who also appears occasionally in this spin-off. In [...] "Adventures in Paradise, Part Two" [...] (1994), Lilith gets engaged to her fiancé Brian (James Morrison), much to Frasier's dismay. In [...] "A Lilith Thanksgiving" [...] (1996), Frasier and Lilith have Frederick admitted into a private school after they annoy the administrator (Paxton Whitehead) several times on Thanksgiving. In [...] "The Unnatural" [...] (1997), Frasier is proven as unathletic and bad at softball, which he reluctantly admits to Frederick. Then Frasier tells him that, when Frasier was a third-grade elementary student, Martin was bad at math.|$|E

50|$|Early dials {{worked by}} direct or forward action. The pulses were {{generated}} as the dial {{turned toward the}} finger stop position. When the user's hand motion was erratic, it produced wrong numbers. In the late 19th century, the <b>dial</b> was refined <b>to</b> operate automatically by a recoil spring. The user selected the digit <b>to</b> be <b>dialed,</b> rotated the <b>dial</b> <b>to</b> the finger stop, then released it. The spring caused the <b>dial</b> <b>to</b> rotate back to its home position during which time constant speed was maintained with a centrifugal governor.|$|R
