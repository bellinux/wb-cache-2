2500|$|In early November 1910, Aldrich {{met with}} five well known {{members of the}} New York banking {{community}} to devise a central banking bill. Paul Warburg, an attendee of the meeting and longtime advocate of central banking in the U.S., later wrote that Aldrich was [...] "bewildered at all that he had absorbed abroad and he was faced with {{the difficult task of}} writing a highly technical bill while being harassed by the daily grind of his parliamentary duties". After ten days of deliberation, the bill, which would later be referred to as the [...] "Aldrich Plan", was agreed upon. It had several key components, including a central bank with a Washington-based headquarters and fifteen branches located throughout the U.S. in geographically strategic locations, and a uniform <b>elastic</b> <b>currency</b> based on gold and commercial paper. Aldrich believed a central banking system with no political involvement was best, but was convinced by Warburg that a plan with no public control was not politically feasible.

50|$|Cortelyou {{served as}} the Secretary of the Treasury, from March 4, 1907 to March 7, 1909. This was during the devastating Panic of 1907. Like his predecessor, Leslie M. Shaw, Cortelyou {{believed}} it was Treasury's duty to protect the banking system, but {{he realized that the}} Treasury was not equipped to maintain economic stability. He eased the crisis by depositing large amounts of government funds in national banks and buying government bonds. To prevent further crises, Cortelyou advocated a more <b>elastic</b> <b>currency</b> and recommended the creation of a central banking system.|$|E
50|$|To this end, Shaw bought {{back the}} {{government}} bonds from commercial banks that owned them, {{increased the number}} of government depository banks, and in 1902, he told the banks that they no longer needed to keep cash reserves against their holdings of public funds. The intended effect of these actions was to provide a more <b>elastic</b> <b>currency</b> which would then respond {{to the needs of the}} market. The government intervention in the money market reached its height with Shaw. He resigned on March 3, 1907, to become as the banker in New York City.|$|E

50|$|While the United States Notes {{had been}} used as a form of debt {{issuance}} during the Civil War, afterwards they were used as a way of moderately influencing the money supply by the federal government—such as through the actions of Boutwell and Richardson. During the Panic of 1907, President Theodore Roosevelt attempted to increase liquidity in the markets by authorizing the Treasury to issue more Greenbacks, but the Aldrich-Vreeland Act provided for the needed flexibility by the National Bank Note supply instead. Eventually, the perceived need for an <b>elastic</b> <b>currency</b> was addressed with the Federal Reserve Notes authorized by the Federal Reserve Act, and attempts to alter the circulating quantity of United States Notes ended.|$|E
5000|$|Lincoln, like Henry Clay, favored federal {{control over}} the nation's banking system, but President Jackson had {{effectively}} killed the Bank of the United States by 1835. That same year Lincoln crossed party lines to vote with pro-bank Democrats in chartering the Illinois State Bank. As {{he did in the}} internal improvements debates, Lincoln searched for the best available alternative. According to historian and Lincoln biographer Richard Carwardine, Lincoln felt: [...] A well-regulated bank would provide a sound, <b>elastic</b> <b>currency,</b> protecting the public against the extreme prescriptions of the hard-money men {{on one side and the}} paper inflationists on the other; it would be a safe depository for public funds and provide the credit mechanisms needed to sustain state improvements; it would bring an end to extortionate money-lending.|$|E
5000|$|The Federal Reserve Act {{presented}} by Congressman Carter Glass and Senator Robert L. Owen incorporated modifications by Woodrow Wilson and {{allowed for a}} regional Federal Reserve System, operating under a supervisory board in Washington, D.C. Congress approved the Act, and President Wilson signed it into law on December 23, 1913. The Act, [...] "Provided {{for the establishment of}} Federal Reserve Banks, to furnish an <b>elastic</b> <b>currency,</b> to afford means of rediscounting commercial paper, to establish a more effective supervision of banking in the United States, and for other purposes. The Act provided for a Reserve Bank Organization Committee that would designate no less than eight but no more than twelve cities to be Federal Reserve cities, and would then divide the nation into districts, each district to contain one Federal Reserve City.|$|E
50|$|The plan {{proposed}} by the Monetary Commission provided {{for the establishment of}} local associations of banks and the grouping of these into regional associations. These were further grouped into a national reserve association with a head office at Washington. Under certain conditions, all banks in the country were to be eligible for membership in this central institution. Its functions were to be essentially the same as those performed by the great central banks or Europe, namely, the holding and administration of the bank reserves of the country, the issue of an <b>elastic</b> <b>currency</b> based upon commercial assets, the rediscount or commercial paper for banking institutions, and the serving as depositary and disbursing agent for the Government. The commission believed that it had worked out a system of control which would prevent the domination of the association by any group of interests, political or financial.|$|E
50|$|Bankers {{felt the}} real {{problem was that the}} United States was the last major country without a central bank, which might provide {{stability}} and emergency credit in times of financial crisis. While segments of the financial community were worried about the power that had accrued to JP Morgan and other 'financiers', most were more concerned about the general frailty of a vast, decentralized banking system that could not regulate itself without the extraordinary intervention of one man. Financial leaders who advocated a central bank with an <b>elastic</b> <b>currency</b> after the Panic of 1907 included Frank Vanderlip, Myron T. Herrick, William Barret Ridgely, George E. Roberts, Isaac Newton Seligman and Jacob H. Schiff. They stressed the need for an elastic money supply that could expand or contract as needed. After the scare of 1907 the bankers demanded reform; the next year, Congress established a commission of experts {{to come up with a}} nonpartisan solution.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Elastic</b> <b>currency</b> (magnitude of {{the money}} multiplier): the success of {{monetary}} policy {{is dependent on the}} ability to strongly influence the supply of money available to the citizens. If a currency is highly [...] "elastic" [...] (that is, has a higher money multiplier, corresponding to a tendency of the financial system to create more broad money for a given quantity of base money), plans to expand the money supply and accommodate growth are easier to implement. Low elasticity was one of many factors that contributed to the depth of the Great Depression: as banks cut lending, the money multiplier fell, {{and at the same time}} the Federal Reserve constricted the monetary base. The depression of the late 1920s is generally regarded as being the worst in the country's history, and the Federal Reserve has been criticized for monetary policy which worsened the depression. [...] Partly to alleviate problems related to the depression, the United States transitioned from a gold standard and now uses a fiat currency; elasticity is believed to have been increased greatly.|$|E

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the desirability of}} having an <b>elastic</b> <b>currency</b> generated by a lender of last resort that prints money and lends it to banks in distress. When banks cannot borrow, the economy has a unique equilibrium that is not Pareto optimal. The introduction of unlimited borrowing at a zero nominal interest rate generates a steady state equilibrium that is Pareto optimal. However, this policy is destabilizing {{in the sense that}} it also introduces a continuum of non-optimal inflationary equilibria. We explore two alternate policies aimed at eliminating such monetary instability while preserving the steady-state benefits of an <b>elastic</b> <b>currency.</b> If the lender imposes an upper bound on borrowing that is low enough, no inflationary equilibria can arise.

40|$|System in 1913, {{the banking}} system was {{occasionally}} beset by currency shortages, particularly in times of bank panics when currency demand rose sharply.

40|$|The Federal Reserve Act calls {{upon the}} newly created Banks " [...] . to furnish an <b>elastic</b> <b>currency</b> [...] . " since such action {{was thought to be}} welfare {{improving}} during times of high currency demand. This paper considers the welfare implications of an "elastic currency" regime within the context of an overlapping generations model of fiat money that includes banks that face aggregate risk. Although in the economy's stationary equilibrium the bank chooses to hold both fiat currency and illiquid capital in its portfolio, it would prefer to hold additional amounts of currency (were they available) during periods of high withdrawal demand. To remedy this problem, a central bank is introduced that offers zero-interest, intraperiod loans of currency via a discount window. When the central bank optimally chooses the size of the loan, it is shown that the resulting stationary equilibrium supports the economy's "golden rule" allocation. ...|$|E
40|$|My topic {{today is}} the role of {{monetary}} aggregates in economic analysis and monetary policymaking at the Federal Reserve. I will take a historical perspective, which will {{set the stage for a}} brief discussion of recent practice. The Federal Reserve’s responsibility for managing the money supply was established at its founding in 1913, as the first sentence of the Federal Reserve Act directed the nation’s new central bank "to furnish an <b>elastic</b> <b>currency.</b> " 1 However, the Federal Reserve met this mandate principally by issuing currency as needed to damp seasonal fluctuations in interest rates, and during its early years the Federal Reserve did not monitor the money stock or even collect monetary data in a systematic way. 2, 3 The Federal Reserve’s first fifteen years were a period of relative prosperity, but the crash of 1929 ushered in a decade of global financial instability and economic depression. Subsequent scholarship, notably the classic monetary history by Milton Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz (1963), argued that the Federal Reserve’s failure to stabilize the money supply was an important cause of the Great Depression. That view today commands considerable support among economists, although I note that the sources of the Federal Reserve’s policy errors during the Depression went much deeper than...|$|E
40|$|The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 {{created the}} Fed ‘to furnish an <b>elastic</b> <b>currency,</b> {{to afford the}} means of {{rediscounting}} commercial paper, to establish a more effective supervision of banking in the United States, and for other purposes’. For many years, the guiding principle of the Fed was the ‘Real Bills Doctrine ’ under which the Fed ‘rediscounted ’ eligible paper (lending reserves to banks) to facilitate trade. During WWI, the Fed purchased Treasury debt as interest-earning assets, {{although it was not}} noticed until the 1920 s that this added bank reserves, supporting a multiple expansion of deposits [...] the ‘deposit multiplier’. In 1924 the Fed first attempted to operate countercyclically, loosening policy in recession to increase bank lending. However, bond purchases did not increase reserves because banks retired loans at the discount window [...] the first of many times that the Fed learned it could not ‘push on a string’: reserves, loans, and the money supply are demand determined and cannot be increased directly through monetary policy. Symmetrically, analysts found that bond sales merely forced banks to the discount window to replace lost reserves. Hence, the Fed could not control bank lending through attempts to control reserves. Interpretations of the Fed’s policy during the 1930 s range from the Monetarist claim that the Fe...|$|E
40|$|In my view, the Fed has {{performed}} {{at least as}} well over its first 100 years as could have been expected given the limits of, and evolution in, {{our understanding of how}} the economy operates and given the Fed’s institutional structure and political environment. The key to improving performance in the future is to give the Fed the tools it needs to do its job, to allow the Fed free rein in using those tools as it sees fit, to demand that the Fed explain its actions to the public contemporaneously, and to hold the Fed accountable for any failure to achieve its objectives that could reasonably have been prevented. My biggest worry is that the Fed faces more restrictions on its powers than any of the world’s other major central banks, raising the risk that it may be unable to achieve its objectives at some time in the future.

40|$|We study {{an economy}} where {{consumers}} {{are subject to}} liquidity demand shocks and banks arise endogenously to provide insurance against these shocks.

The introduction of unlimited lending at a zero nominal interest rate generates a steady state equilibrium allocation that is Pareto optimal.
