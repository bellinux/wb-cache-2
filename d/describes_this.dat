5|$|Caligula's {{religious}} {{policy was}} {{a departure from}} that of his predecessors. According to Cassius Dio, living emperors could be worshipped as divine {{in the east and}} dead emperors could be worshipped as divine in Rome. Augustus had the public worship his spirit on occasion, but Dio <b>describes</b> <b>this</b> as an extreme act that emperors generally shied away from. Caligula took things a step further and had those in Rome, including senators, worship him as a tangible, living god.|$|E

5|$|Motion, {{the process}} of movement, is {{described}} using specific anatomical terms. Motion includes movement of organs, joints, limbs, and specific sections of the body.

Anatomists use a unified set of terms to describe most of the movements, although other, more specialized terms are necessary for describing {{the uniqueness of the}} movements such as those of the hands, feet, and eyes.|$|E

5|$|Matsya Purana tells a {{different}} story of Chamunda's origins. She with other matrikas was created by Shiva to help him kill the demon Andhakasura, who has an ability - like Raktabija - to generate from his dripping blood. Chamunda with the other matrikas drinks {{the blood of the}} demon ultimately helping Shiva kill him. Ratnakara, in his text Haravijaya, also <b>describes</b> <b>this</b> feat of Chamunda, but solely credits Chamunda, not the other matrikas of sipping the blood of Andhaka. Having drunk the blood, Chamunda's complexion changed to blood-red. The text further says that Chamunda does a dance of destruction, playing a musical instrument whose shaft is Mount Meru, the spring is the cosmic snake Shesha and gourd is the crescent moon. She plays the instrument during the deluge that drowns the world.|$|E

Brown got Jones – who had a long and successful career in Cleveland – in a trade with the Brooklyn Dodgers for the rights to draft Bob Chappuis. Author Andy Piasick <b>describes</b> <b>this</b> trade {{as one of the most}} astute in Browns history. The Browns also signed quarterback Y. A. Tittle from Louisiana State University, but were forced to send him to the Baltimore Colts as part of an effort to balance talent among the AAFC's teams during the league's third year of play.|$|E
5|$|Some species, {{such as the}} gemsbok, sable antelope, and Grant's gazelle, are camouflaged with {{strongly}} disruptive facial markings that {{conceal the}} highly recognisable eye. Many species, such as gazelles, may be made to look flat, and hence to blend into the background, by countershading. The outlines of many bovids are broken up with bold disruptive colouration, the strongly contrasting patterns helping to delay recognition by predators. However, all the Hippotraginae (including the gemsbok) have pale bodies and faces with conspicuous markings. The zoologist Tim Caro <b>describes</b> <b>this</b> as difficult to explain, but given that the species are diurnal, he suggests that the markings may function in communication. Strongly contrasting leg colouration is common only in the Bovidae, where for example Bos, Ovis, bontebok and gemsbok have white stockings. Again, communication is the likely function.|$|E
5|$|Disillusioned with Covent Garden, MacMillan {{accepted}} {{an invitation from}} the Deutsche Oper in Berlin to run its ballet company. Parry <b>describes</b> <b>this</b> as an unhappy experience. Though at Covent Garden Webster may sometimes have been suspected of favouring the opera {{at the expense of}} the ballet, MacMillan discovered that at the Berlin house there was no doubt that the ballet was given distinctly lower priority. He did not speak German, which reduced his enjoyment from watching films (of which he was a great devotee) and theatre and limited him generally in everyday life. Although he had taken several colleagues with him, including Seymour, many moved away over the course of his nearly four years in charge, and MacMillan became increasingly isolated. It was the first time he had been in a managerial as well as a creative role, and the strain affected his physical and mental health. He smoked and drank heavily and suffered a minor stroke.|$|E

5|$|Given a {{classical}} name for Japan, Fusō was {{built at the}} Samuda Brothers shipyard in Cubitt Town, London. Japanese sources universally give the date for Kongōs keel-laying as 24 September 1875the same as that for the awarding of the contractbut historian Hans Langerer <b>describes</b> <b>this</b> as improbable, arguing that no shipyard would order enough material to begin construction without cash in hand. Fusō was launched on 14 April 1877 when Ueno Ikuko, wife of the Japanese consul, cut the retaining rope with a hammer and chisel. Completed in January 1878, the ship sailed for Japan before 22 March {{under the command of}} a British captain and with a British crew because the IJN was not yet ready for such a long voyage. While transiting the Suez Canal, she was lightly damaged when she ran aground on 27 April. She received temporary repairs at a local dockyard and arrived in Yokohama on 11 June. She was classified as a second-class warship while still in transit. She was transferred to Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 17 June for permanent repairs. On 10 July a formal ceremony was held in Yokohama for the receipt of the ship that was attended by the Meiji Emperor and many senior government officials. The ship was then opened for tours by the nobility, their families and invited guests for three days after the ceremony. Beginning on 14 July, the general public was allowed to tour the ship for a week.|$|E

5|$|The {{contract}} for Hiei {{was awarded to}} Milford Haven Shipbuilding and Engineering Co. in Pembroke Dock, Wales, on 24 September 1875 {{for the price of}} £119,600, exclusive of armament. Japanese sources universally give the date for Hieis keel-laying as 24 September 1875—the same as that for the awarding of the contract—but historian Hans Langerer <b>describes</b> <b>this</b> as improbable, arguing that no shipyard would order enough material to begin construction without cash in hand. She was launched on 12 June 1877; Reed's daughter smashed a bottle of champagne on the ship's bow in the traditional Western style. The ship was named for Mount Hiei. Completed in February 1878, Hiei sailed for Japan on 22 March under the command of a British captain and with a British crew because the IJN was not yet ready for such a long voyage. One of the passengers aboard her was the future admiral Togo Heihachiro, who had just completed six years of study in the United Kingdom. She arrived in Yokohama on 22 May and was assigned to the Tokai Naval District a month later. On 10 July a formal ceremony was held in Yokohama for the receipt of the ship that was attended by the Meiji Emperor and many senior government officials. The ship was opened for tours by the nobility, their families and invited guests for three days after the ceremony. On 14 July, the general public was allowed to tour the ship for a week.|$|E

5|$|Decorating of the Bride {{is one of}} Jovanović's Orientalist works, notable {{examples}} of which include The Wounded Montenegrin (1882), Fencing Lesson (1883) and Cockfight (1897). The painting is undated, and it remains unknown exactly when it was composed. Petar Petrović, the curator of the National Museum of Serbia, dates it to ca. 1885–86. Art historian Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson writes that it was painted in 1888. What is known for certain is that Jovanović painted it in the mid-1880s {{on one of his}} travels through the Balkans. One source contends that it was composed while the artist was visiting the Ottoman town of Shkodër, in present-day Albania. Another version of the painting {{is said to have been}} created by the artist not long after the original, but is considered lost. An 1891 journal article <b>describes</b> <b>this</b> version as depicting two women decorating the bride, while to her left the bride's mother clasps her hands and cries with joy. This version is said to have shown a girl on the verge of tears standing by a door to the far left. On the right, a woman and young girl could be seen offering gifts to the bride. During conservatory examinations in 2009, it was discovered that Decorating of the Bride had been painted over a similar, earlier work. The artist appears to have shortened the right side of the canvas by about , altered the appearance of the interior, and slightly modified the left side of the painting. Save for the shortened canvas length, the right side of the painting is identical to that in the final version.|$|E
