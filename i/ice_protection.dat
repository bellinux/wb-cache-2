40|$|Investigations {{have been}} made in flight and in wind tunnels to {{determine}} which components of turbojet installations are most critical in icing conditions, and to evaluate several methods of <b>icing</b> <b>protection.</b> From these studies, the requirements necessary for adequate <b>icing</b> <b>protection</b> and the consequent penalties on engine performance can be estimated. Because investigations have indicated that the compressor-inlet screen constitutes the greatest icing hazard and is difficult to protect, complete removal or retraction of the screen upon encountering an icing condition is recommended. In the absence of the screen, the inlet guide vanes of an axial-flow-type turbojet engine constitute the greatest danger to engine operation in an icing condition; a centrifugal-type engine, on the other hand, is relatively unsusceptible to icing once the screen has been removed. Of the three icing-protection systems investigated, surface heating, hot-gas bleedback, and inertia-separation inlets, only the first two offer an acceptable {{solution to the problem of}} engine <b>icing</b> <b>protection.</b> Surface heating, either by gas heating or electrical means, appears to be the most acceptable icing-protection method with regard to performance losses. Hot-gas bleedback, although causing undesirable thrust losses, offers an easy means of obtaining <b>icing</b> <b>protection</b> for some installations. The final choice of an icing-protection system depends, however, on the supply of heated gas and electrical power available and on the allowable performance and. weight penalties associated with each system...|$|R

40|$|This {{monograph}} {{is motivated}} {{by the lack of}} an autonomous <b>icing</b> <b>protection</b> solution for small unmanned aerial vehicles. The atmospheric phenomenon commonly referred to as aircraft icing is one the most dangerous weather hazards to all of aviation. When an aircraft operates in atmospheric conditions that sustain icing, a potential of ice forming on exposed aircraft surfaces arises. The most significant of these surfaces are the leading edge of aircraft wings, stabilisers, and various control surfaces. This monograph focusses on icing as it forms on the leading edge of wings. The consequences of icing range from insignificant to dire, even fatal. For unmanned aerial vehicles, as is the case for conventional aircraft, the impact of icing primarily relates to controllability of the aircraft. Once icing forms on the wings the aerodynamic shape is altered. Typically this leads to changes in the aerodynamic characteristics of the wing, i. e. maximum lift can decrease by as much as 80 % and drag can increase by more than 60 %. For small unmanned aerial vehicles there are no commercially available icing mitigating solutions, aside from grounded operations. This monograph is a presentation of just such a solution. The <b>icing</b> <b>protection</b> solution is based on three primary elements, 1) an electro-thermal source, 2) an intelligent control unit, and 3) a power source. In essence the solution provides according to the following; the control unit is primed by an on-board atmospheric sensor package, measuring ambient environmental conditions. Once the risk of icing is established, two ice detection algorithms - working in parallel - are activated. This approach ensures robustness and accuracy. If icing is detected, control algorithms trigger the power supplied to the electro-thermal source, thereby achieving temperature control of the thermal source. For conventional aircraft, icing detection is usually performed by larger optical sensors or a pilots visual inspection. For UAVs icing detection is a relatively new research topic. In this monograph two markedly different approaches to icing detection for UAVs are proposed. Common for both is the objective of detecting icing as it forms on the leading edge of aircraft wings. One <b>icing</b> <b>protection</b> solution presented in this monograph is denoted the modelbased icing detection algorithm. It addresses the issue in a fault diagnosis framework by generating residuals used to detect aircraft surface faults (that is aerodynamic changes), indicating that icing is forming on {{the leading edge of the}} aircraft wings. The proposed algorithm relies on estimates of aerodynamic parameters - obtained under nominal flight conditions - and the aerodynamic model of the aircraft. Should these parameters change unexpectedly a surface fault has occurred, i. e. icing is forming on the wings of the aircraft. The proposed algorithm has been validated through numerical analyses. The second icing detection algorithm proposed is denoted the electro-thermalbased icing detection algorithm. It also addresses the issue of icing detection in a fault diagnosis framework, but where the prior algorithm uses the aerodynamic model of the aircraft to accomplish this, the latter algorithm applies a model of the thermodynamic system surrounding the aircraft wings and the electro-thermal source. The electro-thermal-based icing detection algorithm uses temperature gradients, obtained from the electro-thermal source, and unexpected changes in these to detect changes in the thermodynamic system. A change could be an added element as a layer of ice. The proposed approach has been validated through a simulation study. To evaluate the electro-thermal source layout and area size, several thermodynamic analyses are conducted. Simulations are conducted to determine the relationship between area size and power consumption, while responses from other simulations are used to investigate and evaluate the thermal distribution differences of electro-thermal sources applied to various UAV platforms. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed icing detection solution wind tunnel experiments and flight tests have been conducted. Preliminary integration procedures are developed to ensure little to no negative aerodynamic impact, while abiding by requirements for airworthiness and safe flight operations. Wind icing tunnel experiments have been conducted for various required <b>icing</b> <b>protection</b> program routines, i. e. icing detection, de-icing, and anti-icing. Experiments have been conducted in atmospheric conditions ranging from non-icing to varying severity degrees of icing. Preliminary flights include the worlds first flight for any UAV fitted with an autonomous <b>icing</b> <b>protection</b> solution, completed in a collaboration between NTNUAMOS and NASA Ames Research Center and conducted in Anchorage, Alaska. Operational flights have been conducted at Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard, where the aforementioned <b>icing</b> <b>protection</b> program routines have been tested, verifying the <b>icing</b> <b>protection</b> solution...|$|R

40|$|The <b>icing</b> <b>protection</b> {{obtained}} from an internally air-heated propeller blade partitioned to confine the heated air forward of 25 -percent chord {{was investigated in}} the NACA Cleveland icing research tunnel. A production-model hollow steel propeller was modified with an Internal radial partition at 25 -percent chord and with shank and tip openings to admit and exhaust the heated air. Temperatures were measured on the blade surfaces and in the heated-air system during tunnel icing conditions. Heat-exchanger effectiveness and photographs of Ice formations on the blades were obtained. Surface temperature measurements indicated that confining the heated air forward of the 25 -percent chord gave. a more economical distribution of the applied heat as compared with unpartitioned and 50 -percent partitioned blades, by dissipating {{a greater percentage of}} the available heat at the leading edge. At a propeller speed of 850 rpm, a heating rate of 7000 Btu per hour per blade at a shank air temperature of 400 F provided adequate <b>Icing</b> <b>protection</b> at ambient-air temperatures of 23 F but not at temperatures as low as 15 F.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} the Aerospace Engineering Department (DIAS) at Federico II University of Naples aiming to evaluate the feasibility {{and the performance of}} an electrically heated composite leading edge for anti-icing and de-icing applications. A 283 [mm] chord NACA 0012 airfoil prototype was designed, manufactured and equipped with an High Temperature composite leading edge with embedded Ni-Cr heating element. The heating element was fed by a DC power supply unit and the average power densities supplied to the leading edge were ranging 1. 0 to 30. 0 [kW m- 2]. The present investigation focused on thermal tests experimentally performed under fixed icing conditions with zero AOA, Mach= 0. 2, total temperature of - 20 [°C], liquid water content LWC= 0. 6 [g m- 3] and average mean volume droplet diameter MVD= 35 [µm]. These fixed conditions represented the top icing performance of the Icing Flow Facility (IFF) available at DIAS and therefore it has represented the “sizing design case” for the tested prototype. An analytical model has been also developed both for the preliminary sizing and test guidance. Running wet and fully evaporative functional modes have been verified both analytically and experimentally with reasonable agreement. A room temperature thermal endurance test has been run for 104 cycles with max thermal load representative of 1. 5 times the max temperature experienced within the leading edge in fully evaporative conditions aiming to verify the integrity of the composite laminate after the imposed thermal stress through micrographic inspection. The achieved results, despite obtained under limited icing conditions imposed by the IFF wind tunnel, showed great potentialities for the proposed <b>Icing</b> <b>Protection</b> System named EHCLE (Electrical Heated Composite Leading Edge) which has been constantly working below 60 % of its maximum operative temperatures under the given icing conditions and the explored power densities.

40|$|With the {{increased}} use of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) for civil and commercial applications, there is a strong demand for new regulations and technology that will eventually permit for the integration of UAS in unsegregated airspace. This requires new technology to ensure sufficient safety and a smooth integration process. The absence of a pilot on board a vehicle introduces new problems that do not arise in manned flight. One challenging and safety critical issue is flight in known icing conditions. Whereas in manned flight, dealing with icing is left to the pilot and his appraisal of the situation at hand, in unmanned flight this is no longer an option and new solutions are required. To address this, an icing-related decision-making system (IRDMS) is proposed. The system quantifies in-flight icing based on changes in aircraft performance and measurements of environmental properties, and evaluates what the effects on the aircraft are. Based on this, it determines whether the aircraft can proceed, and whether and which available <b>icing</b> <b>protection</b> systems should be activated.
