5|$|Order of the Eastern Star In 1850, Rob Morris {{created the}} Order of the Eastern Star for Freemasons and their female relatives.

5|$|The Jewish {{immigration}} to Puerto Rico {{began in the}} 15th century {{with the arrival of}} the anusim (variously called conversos, Crypto-Jews, Secret Jews or marranos) who accompanied Christopher Columbus on his second voyage. An open Jewish community did not <b>flourish</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> colony because Judaism was prohibited by the Spanish Inquisition. However, many migrated to mountainous parts of the island, far from the central power of San Juan, and continued to self-identify as Jews and practice Crypto-Judaism.|$|E
5|$|From the 1860s, Flemish {{literature}} {{began to}} reflect the Realist style already popular in France, under writers such as Anton Bergmann and Virginie Loveling. The works feature detailed depictions of ordinary aspects of daily life and often have a pessimistic tone. Heavily influenced by Belgian dialects such as West Flemish, the poet and priest Guido Gezelle produced lyric poems in Dutch from the 1850s {{until his death in}} 1899. In 1893, the cultural magazine Van Nu en Straks ("Of Today and Tomorrow") was launched to bring Flemish literature to an audience outside Belgium. Flemish literature continued to <b>flourish</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first decades of the 20th century under writers such as Stijn Streuvels.|$|E

5|$|The Bruges {{exhibition}} {{renewed interest}} in the period and initiated scholarship that was to <b>flourish</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 20th century. Johan Huizinga was the first historian to place Netherlandish art squarely in the Burgundian period – outside of nationalistic borders – suggesting in his book The Waning of the Middle Ages, published in 1919, that the flowering of the school in the early 15th century resulted wholly from the tastes set by the Burgundian court. Another exhibition visitor, Georges Hulin de Loo, published an independent critical catalogue highlighting {{the large number of}} mistakes in the official catalogue, which had used attributions and descriptions from the owners. He and Max Friedländer, who visited and wrote a review of the Bruges exhibition, went on to become leading scholars in the field.|$|E
5|$|In the soil, {{the roots}} {{encounter}} the hyphae of fungi. Many {{of these are}} known as mycorrhiza and form a mutualistic relationship with the tree roots. Some are specific to a single tree species, which will not <b>flourish</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> absence of its mycorrhizal associate. Others are generalists and associate with many species. The tree acquires minerals such as phosphorus from the fungus while it obtains the carbohydrate products of photosynthesis from the tree. The hyphae of the fungus can link different trees and a network is formed, transferring nutrients {{from one place to}} another. The fungus promotes growth of the roots and helps protect the trees against predators and pathogens. It can also limit damage done to a tree by pollution as the fungus accumulate heavy metals within its tissues. Fossil evidence shows that roots have been associated with mycorrhizal fungi since the early Paleozoic, four hundred million years ago, when the first vascular plants colonised dry land.|$|E
5|$|The 12th Battalion is {{unexpectedly}} attacked {{soon after}} by Intelligent Defense Systems, a private military contractor that had secretly supported first the Lazurians, then the NRA by supplying them with {{weapons of mass}} destruction. Dr. Caulder, leader of the IDS, had taken advantage of the world's devastation to carry out horrific biological and psychological experiments that he would have been unable to undertake otherwise, such as creating and spreading a terrible new disease called the Creeper, which causes flowers to bloom from infected individuals, {{for the sole purpose of}} studying the survivor's reactions. Despite numerous demoralizing attacks by IDS and its massive bomber, the Great Owl, the battalion survives and infiltrates and brings down The Great Owl, eventually pursuing Caulder to his main laboratory and fortress, The Nest. In the end, Caulder is killed in the destruction of his lab, and the war is finally brought to an end. One year later, the village of New Hope, founded by the 12th Battalion after the conflict, begins to <b>flourish</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new-found peace. The sun is seen rising above the nearby hills for the first time since the meteor strikes, giving hope of a brighter future.|$|E

5|$|Within {{weeks of}} the storm, the Alligator Rivers Region Advisory Committee began {{planting}} seedlings in deforested areas. By August 2006, {{a review of the}} growth of the new plants found that 81% to 88% of the seeds had survived and begun growing. To fully restore the South Alligator valley, environmentalists requested A$7.4million (US$6.6million) in funds. In a study at Magela Creek a year after the storm, it was determined that between 8% and 19% of the tree canopy lost due to the storm had begun to recover. Additional studies at the Gulungul Creek and the Alligator Rivers region revealed that suspended sediment values in flowing water had temporarily increased in the wake of Monica. The above-average values persisted for roughly a year before the streams returned to pre-cyclone sediment levels. In a study of the Arnhem forests which were devastated by the cyclone, environmentalists reported that it would take over 100years for the forest to recover. The storm's winds snapped numerous trees, estimated to have been over 200 years old and more than 60cm (23.6in) in diameter. It is estimated that it would take several hundred years before trees of similar sizes would <b>flourish</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region.|$|E

Many of them live as epiphytes, growing on the branches and trunks of trees.|$|E
