40|$|The {{accepted}} {{practice of}} laying water lines {{has been to}} place them well below the anticipated frost level. This is not always possible or practical however, since the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>frost</b> <b>penetration</b> is extremely variable for different winters and for different locations.

The heat loss can be estimated by various theoretical equations provided the thermal conductivity of the soil (k) and a temperature difference (Äè) between the pipes and the surrounding soil are known. Therefore, the use and application of these theoretical equations presents three problems, namely: 1) The need to experimentally check their accuracy. 2) The determination of in situ thermal conductivity of Saskatchewan soils. 3) Selection of a simple means for arriving at Äè, which requires a means of predicting the soil temperature at any depth for various surface conditions.

40|$|Rock fill dams are {{the most}} common kind of dams at hydro power {{stations}} in Sweden. The dams consist of different zones like core, fine filter, coarse filter, rock fill and rip rap. One of the most important parts is the core of the dam, which serves as embankment. The core consists at best of fine grained moraine. Most often the core connects directly against the spillway construction of concrete, which means that the concrete is the only frost protection against the core in the longitudinal direction. The connection between the core and the concrete structure is by experience a weakness zone when it comes to rock fill dams. Geotechnical investigations close to the spillway construction has shown a very low degree of compaction of the soil, which has been explained by hang up effects and difficulties to compact the moraine closest to the concrete structure at the construction stage. Eventually a source to the low degree of compaction might be effects caused by freezing and thawing since freezing take place through the spillway construction into the core of moraine. The purpose of this thesis was to investigate if freezing take place through the concrete construction into the core, and to study effects by possible freezing. The process of freezing requires three basic conditions. The basic conditions required for frost action to occur include a frost-susceptible soil, a supply of water and soil temperatures sufficiently low to cause some of the soil water to freeze. Depending on the frost index, the amount of days with negative temperature, the frost depth will be more or less extensive. The three basic conditions required for frost action to take place are more or less fulfilled at the connection between the core and the spillway structure. Air temperature below zero degrees Celsius will create a difference of temperature per length which will cause a heat flux from the ground surface that is called a thermal gradient. Due to the 0 °C isotherm is getting deeper into the soil, the thermal gradient changes and the frost depth reaches its maximum. When the soil thaws the ice is converted to water. Since the process of freezing has agglomerated more water in the shape of ice than the volume of the pores in the soil may contain, {{there will be a lot}} of excess water in the soil. This excess water must be drained away in order to keep the balance in consideration of the water content of the soil. If the excess water is not drained the strength of the soil will be lowered. When soil freezes the geotechnical properties will be changed. Changes in density, water content and porosity are some examples of differences that might occur. When these properties of the soil are changed changes in micro structure, formation of cracks and changes due to permeability may take place. Mentioned changes will create a zone of weakness and the risk of inner erosion with potential piping will increase. By modeling the <b>frost</b> <b>penetration</b> with Temp/W, a finite element program used to calculate heat flow in geotechnical constructions, effects caused by freezing and thawing in the connection between the core and the spillway construction has been investigated. The analysis has been performed with climate data equal to a winter occurring every period of 50 and 100 year in Luleå respectively Jokkmokk. The calculations did show that freezing will occur through the concrete construction into the core of the dam. Depending on the freezing index and thermal bridges the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>frost</b> <b>penetration</b> will differ. Freezing will already occur at a climate data equal to a normal winter for analysis of both Lulea and Jokkmokk. In Lulea the frost depth will differ between 2. 7 - 4. 0 meters depending on the climate data and the distribution of the reinforcement in the concrete structure. Regarding analysis with input corresponding to the conditions in Jokkmokk the frost depth will diversify between 3. 0 - 4. 6 meters depending on the climate data and the distribution of reinforcement at the concrete construction. To reduce the effects of freezing and thawing cut-off walls might be installed at the connection between the core and the concrete structure. In order to prevent freezing heating coils can be installed connected to the spillway structure. Since the problem of freezing and thawing is complexly some generalizations has been made to be able to investigate the three-dimensional problem with a software which handle with two-dimensional analysis, Temp/W. Further studies should be performed based of more careful investigations of the soil properties and the impact of the freezing process regarded to the amplitude of regulation and the ground water level of the dam. Even external circumstances like snow and wind relation should be considered in further analysis. A recommendation is that these investigations should be performed with software where it is possible to create a three-dimensional model in order to get a more realistic analysis.

40|$|Observations {{on which}} this report is based {{were made in the}} period 1962 - 66. They were made in natural soil and water- main {{trenches}} and were done to establish methods of determining <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>frost</b> <b>penetration,</b> paying special attention to the question of depth, of soil cover over water and sewer mains to prevent freezing. Observations were carried out at 21 stations using special probes at different depths to measure temperature and thermal conductivity, both in bare and snow covered areas. Field observations were used to verify calculation methods. A calculation method was used to determine the frost penetration for five different types of soil at varying mean annual temperatures and minimum winter temperatures. Observations showed that the heat insulating capacity of snow is less than could be expected from its thermal conductivity, mostly because the structure of the snow is continually changing. Therefore an equivalent conductivity was used which depends on the mean annual temperature. Special treatment was given to the depth of soil required over water-mains, which allows for the heating effect of the water carried in the pipes. For the frost protection of service pipes to buildings a practical method suggested is to use electrical heating to compensate for heat losses. The calculated frost penetration method compared well with actual measurements. SOMMAIRE FRANCAIS A SUIVREPeer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Subsurface {{profiles}} {{were obtained}} during airborne and surface short-pulse radar surveys along a winter roadway over the k a n a River near Fairbanks, Alaska. The roadway crossed ice-covered channels and intervening frozen channel bars. The airborne profiles were intended for ice thickness profiling but also revealed sporadic reflections from a deeper horizon beneath the bars. Later profiling {{from the surface}} recorded these deeper reflecting horizons in detail, and they were found to correspond with the base of seasonal frost, measured in drill holes. The sediments immediately beneath e frozen material were saturated and represented {{the top of a}} seasonally variable groundwater table confined and controlled by frost penetration. The profiles made from the surface also revealed reflections {{from the bottom of the}} ice and the channel bottom. However, no significant reflections were observed beneath the channel bottom; reflections from sloping horizons above and below the base of the frost in the bar may indicate alluvial bedding patterns in these deposits. Eleven holes were drilled along the roadway to determine ice thickness, water depth, frost depth and the depth to the river ice-alluvium contact. Wide-angle reflection and refraction soundings were also made to determine electrical properties of materials and to verify our depth interpretations from echo times. These observations indicate that the airborne technique provides an effective method of locating unfrozen channels and measuring the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>frost</b> <b>penetration</b> beneath bars.

The main objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate applicability of SHAW Model in determining maximum <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>frost</b> <b>penetration</b> in soils in some typical climates of Iran. To this end, the daily data of air temperature, soil temperatures at different depths, duration of bright sunshine, and air humidity were collected for the period of 1992 - 2003 for four meteorological stations of Iran including Shahr-e- Kord, Urumia, Sanandaj, and Yazd. Then, the maximum soil frost penetration depth (SFPD) for each year in the above mentioned stations was determined based on both the measured temperatures at different layers of soil and the calculated values using SHAW Model. Results of the analyses indicated that there was a significant linear relationship between the observed and the calculated values of maximum SFPD. The obtained coefficients of linear correlation between the observed and the calculated values for meteorological stations of Shahr-e-Kord, Urumia, Sanandaj and Yazd were 0. 90, 0. 77, 0. 84 and 0. 94, respectively, all being significant at one percent level.

Heat transfer and structural models of a typical dam-foundation-reservoir system are developed.

The rate of convergence of the numerical solution is examined, and a methodology to identify the critical temperature states and to compute the related stresses, considering creep, is presented. Extensive parametric analyses are then performed to determine the relative influence of (i) the geometrical, thermal, and mechanical properties of the dam, (ii) the reservoir, foundation and air temperature distributions, and (iii) the heat supply from solar radiation, on the stress-strain response of the system.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{a description of}} the periglacial environment and features in the vicinity of Tiffindell Ski resort, on the slopes of Ben MacDhui (3001. 2 m.), the highest point of the East Cape Drakensberg, South Africa. Active and inactive periglacial features were located, mapped and described. Of particular interest were periglaciar slope deposits including gelifluction turf-banked lobes and stone lobes, and cryoturbation features including polygons and thufur. Local environmental factors, such as aspect, moisture, topography, soil texture and depth of freezing, appear to act as important controls on the spatial distribution of the periglacial features. Identification and quantification of periglacial processes in the regolith was investigated using temperature and soil moisture sensors coupled to dataloggers. Research was undertaken over a 16 month period from June 1995 to September 1996 so that comparisons between the winter conditions of 1995 and 1996 could be drawn. The Tiffindell area was observed to be characterised in the winter months by 'diurnal freezethaw days', as well as by 'ice days', 1996 experiencing colder temperatures than 1995. With more than 78 % of the days from May to September 1996 being 'ice days', and simultaneously experiencing high soil moisture contents, freezing penetration to a depth of greater than 0. 2 m was observed to occur in the Tiffindell area, causing frost heave and gelifluction. The summer thaw of ice lenses that developed in the cold winter months caused surface movement downslope of gelifluction lobes of up to 39 mm over an 18 month period, although movement declined rapidly with depth and was essentially restricted to the uppermost 130 mm of the regolith. Other features such as sorted and non-sorted polygons and thufur were identified and found to be active under the present climatic conditions and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>frost</b> <b>penetration</b> at Tiffindell.

Potential loss of soil by erosion is high whenever a soil thaws {{from the surface}} creating a saturated soil overlying an impermeable frozen layer. Field studies were conducted to investigate the effect of surface residue on soil freezing. Residue treatments were: 1) bare surface, B; 2) standing stubble with no straw mulch between the rows, SSNM; and 3) standing stubble with straw mulch between the rows, SSM. Water migration to the freezing surface and freezing depth were partially controlled through the mulch cover which thermally insulated the soil. The SSM and SSNM treatments reduced the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>frost</b> <b>penetration</b> {{by an average of}} 35 % compared to the B treatment, {{even in the absence of}} snow cover. During one diurnal freeze/thaw cycle the soil froze to 1. 5 cm on the B treatment; the soil on the SSM treatment did not freeze. Water content of the 0 - to 0. 5 -cm layer increased from 0. 31 at 1800 hours to 0. 57 cm³ /cm³ at 0600 hours on the B treatment. On the unfrozen SSM treatment, water content increased from 0. 34 to 0. 40 cm³ /cm³ during this same time. Soil heat and water flux during a 19 -hour freezing and thawing cycle was numerically simulated using finite differences. The model couples the heat and water flux equations at sub-zero temperatures by the change in soil ice content. An experimental relationship between unfrozen water and sub-zero temperature was used to couple the heat and water flow equations and estimate the change in soil ice content. Field measurements of soil temperature, water content and frost depth were used to validate the model. Measured versus simulated soil temperature at the 1 -cm depth resulted in an r² =. 995. Standard error of the estimate was. 63 °C. Simulated ice and water content of the 0 - to 1 -cm soil layer, at the time of maximum frost penetration, was. 48 g/g, which compares to a measured value of. 44 g/g. Simulated maximum frost depth was 2 cm, which compares to a measured depth of 1. 5 cm.

The characteristic shape of waste temperature versus <b>depth</b> relationships consisted <b>of</b> a convex temperature profile with maximum temperatures observed at central locations within the middle third fraction <b>of</b> the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the waste mass. Lower temperatures were observed above and below this central zone, with seasonal fluctuations occurring near the surface and steady and elevated values (above mean annual earth temperature) near the base of the landfills. Heat gain and long-term temperatures were directly affected by placement temperatures. Sustained concave temperature profiles were observed for winter waste placement. The highest heat gain and resulting high temperatures were observed in Michigan followed by British Columbia, New Mexico, and Alaska. The high heat gain in Michigan was attributed to coupled precipitation/moisture content and waste density. The time-averaged waste temperature ranges were 0. 9 – 33. 0, 14. 4 – 49. 2, 14. 8 – 55. 6, and 20. 5 – 33. 6 °C in Alaska, British Columbia, Michigan, and New Mexico, respectively.

40|$|One terrain {{feature of}} great {{significance}} to the extent, thickness and thermal regime of permafrost is vegetation. Its thermal properties {{determine the amount of}} heat leaving or entering the underlying ground. Vegetation has an indirect effect on climate, which influences permafrost. Treeless vegetation such as lichen and mosses may have a different albedo. Net radiation is also an important factor. Direct measurement of the convection component is extremely difficult and it may be evaluated as the difference between the sum of the other measurements and the total. Bowen's ratio is also sometimes used. Evaporation, including evapotranspiration, withdraws heat from the surrounding atmosphere and from incident solar radiation. Vegetation draws water by transpiration thus depleting the soil of heat held by that water. There are great variations between species. Vegetative cover of dead material has a large insulating effect on the underlying permafrost. <b>Depth</b> <b>of</b> thaw increases where vegetation cover has been removed. The micro climate resulting from vegetation is probably most effective by influencing the wind speed. The density of the vegetation and height of tree cover influences are well known. Ground that permits the greatest degree of water penetration usually thaws to the greatest depths. The low thermal conductivity of snow and its double role as inhibitor <b>of</b> <b>frost</b> <b>penetration</b> during winter and soil thawing in the spring has been noted.

The processes behind emissions at low temperatures are still poorly known.

Removal of snow lowered soil temperature and increased the extent and duration <b>of</b> soil <b>frost</b> which led to enhanced N 2 O emissions during freezing and thawing events in sand and mull soils. The cumulative emissions during the first year when snow was removed over the whole winter were 0. 25, 0. 66 and 3. 0 g N 2 O-N m&minus; 2 yr&minus; 1 in control plots of sand, mull and peat soils, respectively.

40|$|In the Southern Alps, New Zealand, large {{gradients}} in precipitation (< 1 to 12 m year− 1) {{and rock}} uplift (< 1 to 10 mm year− 1) produce distinct post-glacial geomorphic domains in which landslide-driven sediment production dominates in the wet, rapid-uplift western region, and rockfall controls erosion in the drier, low-uplift eastern region. Because the western region accounts for < 25 % {{of the active}} orogen, the dynamics of erosion in the extensive eastern region are of equal importance in estimating the relative balance of uplift and erosion across the Southern Alps. Here, we assess the efficacy <b>of</b> <b>frost</b> cracking as the primary rockfall mechanism in the eastern Southern Alps using air photo and topographic analysis of scree slopes, cosmogenic radionuclide dating of headwalls, paleo-climate data, and a numerical model of headwall temperature. Currently, active scree slopes occur at a relatively uniform mean elevation (1450 m) and their distribution is independent of hillslope aspect and rock type, consistent {{with the notion that}} frost cracking (which is maximized between − 3 and − 8 °C) may control rockfall erosion. Headwall erosion rates of 0. 3 to 0. 9 mm year− 1, measured using in-situ 10 Be and 26 Al in the Cragieburn Range, confirm that rockfall erosion is active in the late Holocene at rates that roughly balance rock uplift. Models <b>of</b> the predicted <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>frost</b> activity are consistent with the scale of fractures and scree blocks in our field sites. Also, vegetated, paleo-scree slopes are ubiquitous at elevations lower than active scree slopes, consistent with the notion that lower temperatures during the last glacial advance induced pervasive rockfall erosion due to frost cracking. Our modeling suggests temporally-averaged peak frost cracking intensity occurs at 2300 m a. s. l., the approximate elevation of the highest peaks in the central Southern Alps, suggesting that the height of these peaks may be limited by a “frost buzzsaw. ...|$|R
40|$|After {{the winter}} of 1962 - 1963 the frost damage in the Netherlands to road constructions was enormous. The "Studie Centrum Wegenbouw" made {{inquiries}} on road constructors about this damage. A special commision was brought together to look after these inquiries. It proved that many physical aspects about <b>frost</b> <b>penetration</b> were unknown. One of the activities therefore {{had to be a}} study on <b>frost</b> <b>penetration</b> into soils. For this reason a new freezing model is derived. With this model values for frost depths and heave can be calculated with it. The new model differs from known models because of different assumptions. Two important conditions are the original temperature distribution and the original water distribution. Both are assumed to be linear functions of place. The interpretation of masstransport and frozen fringe differs from Jones and Miller. The transport is in agreement with Darcy's law. However, the quantity of transported mass is not only depending on the waterpotentialgradient itself, but also on the location of this gradient and on time. The importance of the factor time follows from the heatfluxes at the freezingfront. Model values are compared with experimental results. Three different types of setups are used. A closed system (no free water) was used to investigate the influence <b>of</b> watercontent on <b>frost</b> <b>penetration.</b> Moisted silversand was applied. The volumemetric watercontent, changed to 6 %. By the so called T. R. R. L. method an opensystem (free water available) was copied. Moistured morainesand was used. Measured frostdepths and heaves are compared with calculated values. A frost-tube, developed by the "Heidemaatschappij" was used to measure frostdepths in the field. Several tubes were placed at different locations into the soil. Airtemperatures and frostdepths were measured during winterperiods. The measurements of the winter 1979 are used here. Unfortunately there was no knowledge about several thermal parameters. The missing values were replaced by the numbers of morainesand. A simple numerical program is developed and used to find the calculated values for frostdepths and heaves. ...|$|R

Frozen ground {{observations}} {{showed that}} deep seasonal ground freeze {{has become a}} rare phenomenon in Lithuania. Since 1948, frozen ground depth has never reached more than 150 cm though according to literary data, in earlier years this <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> ground <b>frost</b> would occur from time to time. Recently, winters with short-lasting and small depth frozen ground have become more frequent. Comparison of the data obtained in the last decades with {{the data from the}} 60 ties– 70 ties of the 20 th century (when the seasonal frozen ground depths were greatest during the history of measuring) shows that <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> ground <b>frost</b> is markedly reducing. This {{can be explained by the}} impacts of global climate warming. In order to test the presumption that the reducing <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> seasonally frozen ground is related with the cycles of warm years and is a periodically recurring phenomenon we analysed the changes of the seasonally frozen ground depth since the end of the 18 th until the beginning of the 21 st century. According to the obtained results, the reduction <b>of</b> the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> seasonally frozen ground has been lasting for more than 200 years. The data also prove a cyclical character <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> variations <b>of</b> seasonally frozen ground (cycles of 90 – 100 years). However,the amplitudes of these variations have been slackening. The greatest reduction of the frozen ground depth was taking place at the end of the 20 th–the beginning of the 21 st centuries. We assume that this trend is related with global warming which is evident from the temperature variations in cold season. It was determined that the maximal <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> seasonally frozen ground varies from region to region of the country. The cluster analysis of the measuring data of 1960 – 2000 was further used for analysis of the regional patterns of frozen ground. The localities where seasonally frozen ground depth was measured can be divided into two groups. The ﬁrst group includes the western part of Lithuania (dominant impact of marine climate) ...|$|R

Late winter GPR surveys over zones of bottom-fast and floating ice indicate that significant spatial variations in the thermal state of sediments exist. Where ice was bottom-fast, two laterally-continuous high amplitude reflections were verified to represent a transition in thermal state of sediment. These thermally-related interfaces closely correlate with changes in ground temperatures from above freezing to below- 0. 5 oC. At locations where bottom-fast ice thickness was less than 1 m complete freezeback of the active layer occurred. Where bottom-fast ice thickness was greater than 1 m thaw exceeded freezeback of the active layer and a near-surface talik was identified.

40|$|The {{potential}} for establishing wind power {{farms in the}} subarctic areas is high due to the combination of large available areas and few conflicting interests. In subarctic climate frost and thaw are major principal design aspects. In foundation work the major impact <b>of</b> <b>frost</b> action is at the outer peripheries of the foundation. Therefore most analysis work and prevention actions such as insulation around the foundation are concentrated {{to this part of}} the structure. The gravity foundations of wind power plants are often constructed as a reinforced concrete monolite. In the centre of the footing a steel cage is attached for anchoring the wind mill tower. This steel cage ends close to the sub-grade and can due to considerably higher thermal conductivity, compared to the concrete structure, transport a lot more heat. By FEM analysis, the <b>frost</b> <b>penetration</b> around, and under two typical wind-power foundations have been analyzed for different climate conditions in Sweden.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{processes}} involved in and consequences of sub-zero temperatures on the soil parameters relevant to landfill liners. The main points discussed in this paper are examination of published investigations and theories, determination of the changing material properties by in-situ laboratory experiments, experimental determination of temperature loads in-situ and of influences of real boundary conditions in laboratory tests and possible thermal protection methods. In general a structure will be formed in the material which is characteristic of the matrix of the material and the main influence parameters. The results are a rising moisture content in the frozen zone (in case of cryosuction), a lower dry density (loosening by ice lenses) and normally a lower shear capacity. The permeability measured in a triaxcell of the thawed material is raised within the factor of five - in extreme cases within the factor of ten. On the whole the changes measured in-situ are smaller than those measured in the laboratory. The changes are partly reversible by loading, but the structure created by frost will remain latent. One of the essential influences on soil parameters and reversibility {{is represented by the}} mineralogy <b>of</b> the material. <b>Frost</b> <b>penetration</b> in the clay liner below a drain layer of about 40 cm (gavel d = 16 / 32) could not be measured during two winter periods with normal to light weather conditions. Following a <b>frost</b> <b>penetration,</b> landfill liners covered with a plastic sealing strip alone or a plastic sealing strip and a geotextile showed only slight changes in dry density and moisture content. Changes in permeability were even less marked. For uncovered landfill liners alternating cycles <b>of</b> rain, <b>frost</b> and drying resulted in noticeable changes in dry density, moisture content and soil structure. In conclusion {{it can be said that}} this paper discusses some materials with regard to their suitability as a thermal protection for landfill mineral liners. In addition, a flow chart for work on frost-related problems within compacted-clay landfill liners is proposed. (orig.)
