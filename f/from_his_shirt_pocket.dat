50|$|Besides super-strength, Yoyo's other {{abilities}} include speed reading, and {{the ability}} to analyze clues at the scene. Yoyo had a built-in Polaroid camera: each time his nose was pressed, a Polaroid photograph of his view would be taken and ejected <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>pocket.</b> Yoyo's control panel was built into his chest, which could be opened by pulling his tie. The level of Yoyo's batteries was critical, because if they ran down his memory and, effectively, his being would be erased. In one episode his batteries came very close to running down completely, and he was charged by being pushed against an electric fence with his arms extended. Yoyo weighed 427 pounds, and his heavy build could absorb the shock of a bomb.|$|E
40|$|Background: Frozen {{shoulder}} is pain resulting {{limited range}} of motion (LGS) on the shoulder. May arise because of the trauma, may also arise gradually without signs or history of trauma.

Results: After treatment for 6 times the obtained results of the assessment of pain in the left shoulder pain silent T 1 : 0 become T 6 : 0, pain motion T 1 : 8. 6 into a T 6 : 7. 1, tenderness T 1 : 7. 2 into a T 6 : 5. 4, increase range of motion left shoulder sagittal plane T 1 : s (30 - 0 - 115) into T 6 : s (45 - 0 - 145), frontal plane T 1 : F (140 - 0 - 45) into T 6 : F (165 - 0 - 59) transverse plane T 1 : T (F 90) (48 - 0 - 60) into T 6 : T (F 90) (60 - 0 - 74), increased functional activity scores ability T 1 : 93. 75 becomes T 6 : 52. 5.
