The bridge was {{described}} as on the old Schoolton road and at Yarbrough's crossing. According to the Associated Press and The Crisis, Laura was raped. The Ledger reported that the men gagged Laura and L. D. with tow sacks and, using rope made of <b>half-inch</b> hemp tied in a hangman's knot, hanged them from the bridge. They {{were found in the}} morning hanging 20ft below the middle span. A local resident, John Earnest, reported the discovery to the sheriff's office.|$|E

His face was fair and smooth as a woman's with high cheekbones, straight nose, a mouth with a firm, but somewhat sad expression, a keen, deep-set but beautiful, mild blue eye, which could become terrible under some circumstances, and like the warning of the rattlesnake, gave notice of attack. Though quick-sighted, he was slow and soft of speech, and posed great natural modesty." ...|$|R
5|$|Amazing {{began as}} a bedsheet format {{magazine}} and remained so until October 1933, when it switched to pulp size. With the April–May 1953 issue Amazing became a digest. Seven issues in the early 1980s, from November 1980 to November 1981, were a <b>half-inch</b> taller than the regular digest size, but thereafter the magazine reverted to the standard digest format. In May 1991 the magazine returned to a large format, but this lasted only until the Winter 1994 issue, and the next three issues were digest-sized again. When the magazine reappeared in 1998, it was in bedsheet format and remained that size until the very end. The last issue, March 2005, was distributed only as a PDF download, never as a physical magazine. The volume numbering contained some irregularities: the numbering given in the tables above {{appears to be in}} error for the period from 1979 to 1983, but in fact it is given correctly in the table. Note also that vol. 27 no. 8 was a single issue, not two, as it seems to be from the table; it was dated Dec 1953/Jan 1954.|$|E

Over time, less key travel was accepted in the market, finally landing on 0.110inches (2.79mm). Coincident with this, Key Tronic was the first company to introduce a keyboard that was only about one inch thick. And now keyboards measure only about a <b>half-inch</b> thick.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} smelter was a bole, a large fire {{built on}} a hill and relying on wind power. It functioned best with large pieces of rich ore known as bing and could not deal with anything small enough to pass through a <b>half-inch</b> mesh riddle. The bole smelter therefore resulted in large amounts of ore accumulating on waste heaps. It required two days of strong wind and could only function when the conditions were favourable.|$|E
5000|$|February 4th.- We {{were all}} given our “tapes” this morning; Fräulein seeing {{that they were}} put on properly, and {{explaining}} the marks to us. The 'tapes' are merely bands of stout webbing about 2in. wide, {{at one end of}} which is a stout buckle. In marking ink Fräulein has indicated inches, <b>half-inches</b> and quarter-inches; each of the latter representing, so she explained to us, a month’s reduction by her system. As I am already 17in., and expect to leave school in rather less than a year, I shall have, she says, to follow her directions implicitly if I intend to gratify mother with the size of waist she wishes me to have upon coming out.

5000|$|Late in 2002, The San Francisco Chronicle {{included}} The Aislers Set in {{its list}} of [...] "Young Artists on the Verge," [...] writing: [...] "The Aislers Set's reinvention of '60s pop resurrects walls of garage guitars and rich, Spector-esque sound, insouciance combined with insightful lyrics. But this quintet makes the past feel contemporary, borrowing from punk and pop to create a 21st century cool sound". [...] The Aislers Set's third album, How I Learned to Write Backwards, {{came out in the}} spring of 2003 with critical praise all around. NME wrote [...] "Sleighbells, Cuban trumpets, <b>half-inched</b> Smiths lyrics and chasms of lovely echo all add to an insomnia-like reverie that clings on long after its mere half-hour is up." [...] "When The Aislers Set hit their mark, they unveil a knack for tying together extremes without ever settling for the middle ground" [...] said MOJO magazine. Pitchfork Media summed up the 2003 version of The Aislers Set: [...] "Here, Linton's indie quintet becomes a pop orchestra. The band's music is denser than ever before, laden with sleigh bells, handclaps and horns piled atop the conventional guitars, drums, bass and keyboards-- and all are drenched in cavernous reverb, providing the ambiance and intimacy of a gigantic, empty concert hall".|$|R
25|$|Pizza strips are {{prepared}} in Italian bakeries {{and sold in}} most supermarkets and convenience stores. They are rectangular strips of pizza without cheese. Their rich flavor comes solely from a dense, zesty tomato paste baked on a <b>half-inch</b> (1.3cm) thick pan pizza crust, and may be enjoyed warm or cold. Party pizza is a box of these pizza strips. Spinach pies are similar to a calzone but filled with seasoned spinach instead of meat, sauce, and cheese. Variations can include black olives or pepperoni with the spinach.|$|E
25|$|Humans in {{contrast}} have thirty-two teeth, sixteen on each jaw, each tooth {{less than a}} <b>half-inch</b> long. Of these teeth, there are four incisors, two canines, four premolars, and six molars. While human incisors are capable of biting into meat, bears have more powerful jaw muscles, which make their bite more destructive to flesh. More appropriate comparisons to bear dentition are to those of dogs whose teeth are similar in proportion to those of bears (and of course much smaller, although capable of inflicting much damage even at their smaller size).|$|E
25|$|When England {{returned}} the visit in 1933–34, Jeoomal {{missed the first}} Test. He scored 2 and 43 at Calcutta, but in Madras, he was hit on the face by Nobby Clark. The ball left a <b>half-inch</b> cut across the left eye. The injury ended his innings {{and he did not}} play another Test. In his first match in the Ranji Trophy, for Sind against Western India in 1934–35, he scored 63 and 53, despite being hit by Amar Singh and Ladha Ramji, and took 5/78 and 3/52 in bowling. He played in the Sind Pentangular matches from 1922 till 1946, scoring 1,993 runs (average 47) with six hundreds.|$|E
25|$|On September 7, 1927, Philo Farnsworth's image {{dissector}} camera tube transmitted its first image, a simple straight line, at his laboratory at 202 Green Street in San Francisco. By September 3, 1928, Farnsworth had developed the system sufficiently to hold a demonstration for the press. This {{is widely regarded as}} the first electronic television demonstration. In 1929, the system was further improved by elimination of a motor generator, so that his television system now had no mechanical parts. That year, Farnsworth transmitted the first live human images with his system, including a three and a <b>half-inch</b> image of his wife Elma ("Pem") with her eyes closed (possibly due to the bright lighting required).|$|E
25|$|She {{received}} performance-enhancing modifications, {{including the}} replacement of her original /23 caliber anti-aircraft battery with /25 calibler guns in 1927–28; the addition of platforms for <b>half-inch</b> (12.7mm) machine guns at the foremast and maintop, {{and the addition of}} catapults to her quarterdeck, aft and number-three (high) turret. West Virginia was one of 14 ships to receive early RCA CXAM-1 radar. During the late 1930s it became evident that {{it was only a matter}} of time before the United States became involved in another large-scale war, and the fleet was dispatched to the Pacific in the spring of 1939 and stationed in Hawaii in 1940 after Fleet Problem XXI as a Japanese deterrent.|$|E
25|$|The storm {{moved into}} Illinois and Wisconsin in the {{afternoon}} of December 1. An inch or two of snow fell in many areas, before a wintry mix of icy precipitation (up to a <b>half-inch</b> of ice accumulation) made things even more treacherous. Numerous highway accidents were reported, resulting in three deaths in Wisconsin and one in Illinois, as well as numerous injuries. In addition, a Mesa Airlines plane with 25 passengers slid off the runway at Dane County Regional Airport in Madison, but no injuries were reported. 400 flights were canceled at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, 28 at Midway International Airport and dozens more at Milwaukee's General Mitchell International Airport. At {{the height of the}} storm, 140,000 customers were without power in Illinois, due to the storm.|$|E
25|$|The Colorado River is a {{major source}} of water in the Southwest and many dams, such as the Hoover Dam, form {{reservoirs}} along it. So much water is drawn for drinking water throughout the West and irrigation in California that in most years, water from the Colorado River no longer reaches the Gulf of California. The Columbia River, the largest river in volume flowing into the Pacific Ocean from North America, and its tributary, the Snake River, water the Pacific Northwest. The Platte runs through Nebraska and was known for being a mile (2km) wide but only a <b>half-inch</b> (1cm) deep. The Rio Grande forms the border between Texas and Mexico before turning due north and splitting New Mexico in half.|$|E
25|$|Since then, the {{telescope}} has been upgraded several times. Initially, when the maximum expected operating frequency was about 500MHz, the surface consisted of <b>half-inch</b> galvanized wire mesh laid {{directly on the}} support cables. In 1974, a high-precision surface consisting of 40,000 individually adjustable aluminum panels replaced the old wire mesh, and the highest usable frequency rose to about 5000MHz. A Gregorian reflector system was installed in 1997, incorporating secondary and tertiary reflectors to focus radio waves at one point. This allowed installing a suite of receivers, covering the full 1–10GHz range, that could be easily moved to the focal point, giving Arecibo more flexibility. A metal mesh screen was also installed around the perimeter to block the ground's thermal radiation from reaching the feed antennas. Finally, a more powerful 2400MHz transmitter was added.|$|E
25|$|Bits {{also differ}} by the {{diameter}} of their shank, with ½ inch, 12mm, 10mm, ⅜inch, 8mm and ¼ inch and 6mm shanks (ordered from thickest to thinnest) being the most common. <b>Half-inch</b> bits cost more but, being stiffer, are less prone to vibration (giving smoother cuts) and {{are less likely to}} break than the smaller sizes. Care must be taken to ensure the bit shank and router collet sizes match exactly. Failure to do so can cause permanent damage to either or both and can lead to the dangerous situation of the bit coming out of the collet during operation. Many routers come with removable collets for the popular shank sizes (in the USA ½-in and ¼-in, in Great Britain ½-in, 8mm and ¼-in, and metric sizes in Europe—although in the United States the ⅜-in and 8mm sizes are often only available for extra cost).|$|E
25|$|The storm then {{proceeded}} to produce a significant swath of ice {{across much of the}} Central Plains. Both storms in total produced between a <b>half-inch</b> to an inch of ice from Oklahoma to Wisconsin, while 8 to 24inches of snow (20–60cm) fell over the mountains of Utah, the highest amount being reported in northern Park City; 6 to 12inches(15–30cm) fell over Colorado and New Mexico while generally less than 6inches fell on the northern side of the system from Nebraska to Quebec, although 10inches (25cm) fell in the Saguenay region of Quebec due to the orographic effect and Lake Saint-Jean. A mixture of snow, sleet, ice, and rain also fell across many of the affected areas. The main energy of the system responsible for the ice storm later moved east and affected portions of the Northeast and Middle Atlantic States with snow and rain on December 13, with the heaviest snow falling across southern and central New York and central New England. Portions of Massachusetts, Connecticut and New York received as much as 12inches (30cm) of snow from the storm, including 7inches (18cm) in Boston.|$|E
25|$|Another major {{winter storm}} {{developed}} on December 14 {{east of the}} Rockies and across the southern states and traveled across {{many of the same}} areas, bringing significant snows to areas that were affected by both ice storms. Portions of Kansas received over a foot (30cm) of snow on top of the accumulated ice. The system moved across the Great Lakes region on December 15 and 16 and intensified while adding moisture from a developing coastal low as well as residual moisture from what was Tropical Storm Olga that affected most of the Antilles and Caribbean. Several areas in the Midwest and eastern North America received close to a foot of snow including Chicago, some areas of the Toronto and Detroit areas, Montreal, and Ottawa. Accumulations of as much as 20inches (50cm) fell across northern New England, northern New York, eastern Ontario from rural eastern Ottawa to Cornwall, and north of the Saint Lawrence River in the province of Quebec into the Charlevoix region. Thundersnow was even reported across portions of southern Ontario and Quebec. Widespread amounts of snow between 8 and 14inches (20–35cm) were reported across Ontario, Quebec, most of New England and the Canadian Maritimes as well as in several areas of the Midwest including Kansas and Missouri, while between a <b>half-inch</b> to an inch (13–25mm) of ice fell across higher elevations in Maryland and Virginia with significant icing as well over West Virginia and Pennsylvania. This was accompanied by heavy rain between 2 and 4inches (50–100mm) south of the Mason–Dixon line towards the Carolinas and the Southeast, with significant rainfall across the Middle Atlantic Coast, coastal sections of Nova Scotia, and the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland and Labrador. Additionally, heavy thunderstorms developed across the Southern states near the Gulf of Mexico coast, where tornado watches were issued for portions of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina on December 15 with several tornadoes later confirmed. The storm finally exited off the coast into the Atlantic Ocean on December 18.|$|E

Here he befriended the writer and philosopher Minakata Kumagusu, becoming involved with Minakata's opposition to the Meiji government's Shrine Consolidation Policy. He and his wife had their first child, a daughter named Matsuko, in 1911.|$|E
500|$|The Nightfly was {{released}} on October 1, 1982 on vinyl and cassette. It was also released in its first prerecorded digital form, via <b>half-inch</b> Beta and VHS format cassettes issued by Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab. In addition, a matching folio for the album {{was released}} by Cherry Lane Music in February 1983. It was first widely available on compact disc in 1984; a reader's poll conducted by Digital Audio magazine the following year ranked it among the best releases of the time, alongside Security (1982) by Peter Gabriel (another fully digital recording) and Bruce Springsteen's Born in the U.S.A. (1984). Early CD copies, however, suffered from being manufactured from third and fourth generation masters. Nichols discovered this when he {{received a call from}} Stevie Wonder, who told him that his CD copy of The Nightfly sounded [...] "funny." [...] Nichols penned an essay in Recording Engineer and Producer, criticizing record companies' apparent carelessness in manufacturing the then-nascent format. The Nightfly was reissued on various disc formats four times in recent years, each time with a multichannel mix: on DVD-Audio in 2002, on DualDisc in 2004, on MVI in 2007 and on hybrid multichannel SACD in The Warner Premium Sound series by Warner Japan in 2011.|$|E
500|$|Preliminary damage surveys {{conducted}} {{by a group of}} structural engineers from Texas Tech University determined that many of the frame homes that were destroyed by the Bridge Creek−Moore tornado were constructed below minimal residential building code standards, discovering some structural deficiencies that violated codes, which were considered to be inadequate for regions prone to tornadic activity (under federal building code standards, frame homes that were properly strapped and bolted would have withstood winds between 152 and 157 miles per hour (245 and 253km/h), equivalent to an F2 tornado). The team, led by meteorological researcher Charles Doswell and storm damage engineer/meteorologist Tim Marshall, determined that nails attached to a plywood roof deck in one damaged home were not properly anchored to the rafters; several homes in rural areas that were swept nearly [...] from their original location did not have anchor bolts that secured the frame to their foundations, as was the case at Country Place Estates, where the homes − which left a trail of debris strewn [...] away from their location − were attached to the concrete foundations by tapered cut nails that extended only a <b>half-inch</b> to the bases; many homes that were left at least partially standing also had their garage doors (mainly those made from aluminum material) collapse inward, allowing the tornado's destructive winds to enter the houses.|$|E

The process of [...] "bouncing down" [...] — dubbing a completed 4-track recording onto one track of another tape was {{susceptible to the}} buildup of noise on the master tape. However, The Happy Prince effectively became Australia's first 8-track recording, achieved by recording onto on two Scully <b>half-inch,</b> 4-track recorders that were electronically synchronised. This de facto 8-track method provided much greater scope for multitracking and overdubbing and a considerable improvement in overall sound quality. The band released The Happy Prince in April 1969.
