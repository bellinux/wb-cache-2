50|$|When {{the wind}} turbine nacelle is {{positioned}} on {{the tower and}} the yaw bearing assembly is completed {{it is necessary to}} adjust the pressure on the individual gliding pads of the bearing. This is necessary in order to avoid un-even wear of the gliding pads and excessive loading on some sectors of the yaw bearing. In order to achieve that, an adjustment mechanism is necessary, which enables the technicians to adjust the contact pressure of each individual gliding element in a controllable and secure way. The most common solution is the utilization of bottom bearing plates equipped with large opening, which accommodate the adjustable gliding bearing systems. These adjustable gliding bearings comprise a gliding unit (i.e. gliding pad) and an adjustable pressure <b>distribution</b> <b>plate.</b> In between the gliding pad and the pressure plate several spring (pre-tension) elements are located. The vertical position of the pressure plates is usually controlled by an adjustment screw. This adjustment screw presses against the pressure plate while being retained by a counter-pressure support plate, fixed on the bearing assembly with strong bolts. In this way it is possible to apply various levels of contact pressure among the different gliding pads and therefore to ensure that each gliding component of the yaw bearing arrangement is performing as anticipated.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. Suspended fly-ash {{particles}} in industrial emission gasses {{have a major}} degrading effect on the whole environment. Electrostatic precipitation {{is one of the}} oldest and most effective gas-cleaning processes used today. Electrostatic precipitators use electrostatic forces to clean the flue gas of ash particles. Stricter emission control laws force industries (like SASOL) to improve their electrostatic precipitators. This study consists of a comprehensive literature survey and the development of a numerical fluid flow model. The proper flow of the gas through an electrostatic precipitator is one of the most important factors to ensure high collection efficiencies. The gas flow must be distributed over the whole flow domain in order to utilize the entire collecting area. The three-dimensional numerical model only considers the fluid dynamics of a precipitator. The finite volume method together with the SIMPLE algorithm is used to solve the fluid dynamic equations. The computer resources available are not sufficient to simulate the full detail of the structures inside a full-scale precipitator. Thus the precipitator flow domain was simplified by making certain assumptions and approximations. The <b>distribution</b> <b>plates</b> in the precipitator inlet ensure good gas distribution through the entire precipitator. Porous baffles are used to approximate the <b>distribution</b> <b>plates</b> and the electrical fields are approximated by porous mediums. The effect of the <b>distribution</b> <b>plates</b> and the electrical fields on the gas flow through the precipitator was investigated. The results have shown that the gas flow was expanded over the whole flow domain and the maximum velocity inside the precipitator was significantly reduced because of the effect of the <b>distribution</b> <b>plates.</b> The simulated gas flow velocity profiles are in relative good agreement with measured velocity profiles. The methodology followed in this study can be used to predict gas flow patterns inside a precipitator but further research is necessary. Master...|$|R

30|$|Through range analysis, the {{following}} {{conclusions can be}} drawn. The main factors affecting the yield stress of bubble-PCWS were solid concentration, aeration time and dosage of frother. However, the effects of aperture size of air <b>distribution</b> <b>plate</b> and type of frother on the yield stress were slight within the experimental range. The optimal levels of multiple factors for the greatest yield stress were as below, aeration time of 30  min, solid concentration of 65  wt%, frother dosage of 0.030  wt% of the air-dried pulverized petroleum coke, aperture size of air <b>distribution</b> <b>plate</b> of 2 – 5  μm and AOS frother type.
