There are several ongoing controversies within narcissism literature, namely: whether narcissism <b>is</b> <b>healthy</b> or unhealthy; a personality disorder; a discrete or continuous variable; defensive or offensive; the same across genders; the same across cultures; and changeable or unchangeable.|$|E
25|$|Maximizing total {{benefits}} or utilitarianism {{can be accomplished}} by saving the most lives or by prognosis (life years).

25|$|Table olive {{varieties}} {{are more difficult}} to harvest, as workers must take care not to damage the fruit; baskets that hang around the worker's neck are used. In some places in Italy, Croatia, and Greece, olives are harvested by hand because the terrain is too mountainous for machines. As a result, the fruit is not bruised, which leads to a superior finished product. The method also involves sawing off branches, which <b>is</b> <b>healthy</b> for future production.|$|E
25|$|Genetic {{samples from}} bears on Kodiak {{have shown that}} they are related to brown bears on the Alaska Peninsula and Kamchatka, Russia, and all brown bears roughly north of the US. Kodiak bears have been genetically {{isolated}} {{since at least the}} last ice age (10,000 to 12,000 years ago) and very little genetic diversity exists within the population. Although the current population <b>is</b> <b>healthy</b> and productive, and has shown no overt adverse signs of inbreeding, it may be more susceptible to new diseases or parasites than other, more diverse brown bear populations.|$|E

25|$|Often, bear {{viewing and}} bear hunting are {{considered}} incompatible. Even if the bear population <b>is</b> <b>healthy</b> and bear hunting is sustainable, ethical questions arise especially if hunting occurs near viewing areas and either during or {{soon after the}} viewing season. Many {{feel that it is}} not fair to encourage bears to be close to people during the summer, only to allow them to be shot in the fall. The Kodiak bear plan recognized bear hunting as a legitimate, traditional, and biologically justifiable activity. It recommended that agencies find ways to make bear hunting and bear viewing compatible on the archipelago.|$|E
25|$|The main sex {{education}} programme in Scotland <b>is</b> <b>Healthy</b> Respect, which focuses {{not only on}} the biological aspects of reproduction but also on relationships and emotions. Education about contraception and sexually transmitted diseases are included in the programme as a way of encouraging good sexual health. In response to a refusal by Catholic schools to commit to the programme, however, a separate {{sex education}} programme has been developed for use in those schools. Funded by the Scottish Government, the programme Called to Love focuses on encouraging children to delay sex until marriage, and does not cover contraception, and as such is a form of abstinence-only sex education.|$|E
25|$|After two {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts to}} rehabilitate and release {{him back into}} the wild, the cub, now nicknamed 'Clover' by handlers, was sent to the park when conservation officers decided that he was not a candidate for relocation. The park has plans to create a custom home for the bear, who has escaped from his temporary enclosure once already. Animal rights group Lifeforce believes that the bear <b>is</b> <b>healthy</b> enough to survive on his own and that he should be relocated and released back into the wild. Provincial government wildlife officials have maintained its position against attempting a long-distance relocation, stating that the risks outweigh the possible benefits, and as of October 2015, the bear remained in captivity.|$|E

25|$|Particularly the North American {{populations of}} the black-necked stilt have {{somewhat}} declined in the 20th century, mainly due to conversion of habitat for human use and pollution affecting both the birds directly {{as well as their}} food stocks. But altogether, the population <b>is</b> <b>healthy</b> and occurs over a large range. This stilt is therefore classified as a Species of Least Concern by the IUCN. The Hawaiian stilt, separated with the black-necked stilt in a distinct species by some (including the IUCN), is very rare however and numbers less than 2,000 individuals. Predation by the small Indian mongoose (Herpestes javanicus auropunctatus), introduced to hunt rats, is suspected to have contributed to its decline.|$|E
25|$|The {{two factors}} that are {{required}} for external otitis to develop are (1) the presence of germs that can infect the skin and (2) impairments in {{the integrity of the}} skin of the ear canal that allow an infection to occur. If the skin <b>is</b> <b>healthy</b> and uninjured, only exposure to a high concentration of pathogens, such as submersion in a pond contaminated by sewage, is likely to set off an episode. However, if there are chronic skin conditions that affect the ear canal skin, such as atopic dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis or abnormalities of keratin production, or if there has been a break in the skin from trauma, even the normal bacteria found in the ear canal may cause infection and full-blown symptoms of external otitis.|$|E
25|$|A {{stallion}} {{will defend}} his group from other males. When challenged, the stallion issues {{a warning to}} the invader by rubbing nose or shoulder with him. If the warning is not heeded, a fight breaks out. Zebra fights often become very violent, with the animals biting at each other's necks, heads or legs, wrestling to the ground, and occasional kicking. Sometimes a stallion will lie still {{on the ground as}} if surrendering, but once the other male lets up, will strike and continue the fight. Most fighting occurs over young mares in estrus, and as long as a harem stallion <b>is</b> <b>healthy,</b> he will usually not be challenged. Only unhealthy stallions have their harems taken over, and even then the new stallion gradually takes over pushing the old one out without a fight.|$|E

25|$|On April 28, 2017, Ellsbury hit {{his first}} career grand slam against the Baltimore Orioles in a 14-11 Yankees {{comeback}} win. It {{was also the}} 100th home run of his career. On May 24, Ellsbury made a superb catch at the center field wall, but also banged {{his head at the}} wall, causing him to suffer a concussion. He was placed on the 7-day disabled list the next day. On June 10, Joe Girardi stated that Ellsbury had lost his job as the Yankees' starting center fielder to Aaron Hicks, who would continue to start even when Ellsbury <b>is</b> <b>healthy.</b> Ellsbury was activated from the disabled list on June 26 after missing 29 games, the same day that Hicks was placed on the 10-day disabled list with an oblique injury. With the rise of star rookie outfielder Clint Frazier, Ellsbury lost his job again and was relegated to the bench. On his 34th birthday on September 11, Ellsbury reached via catcher's interference for the 30th time in his career, which broke Pete Rose's career record of 29.|$|E
