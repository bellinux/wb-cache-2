25|$|The most {{important}} work of Samuel, however, was in Bible exegesis. As early a writer as Abū al-Walīd (Kitāb al-Luma‘, p.15) {{called him a}} leading advocate of simple, temperate explanation ("peshaṭ"), and Abraham ibn Ezra, although finding fault with his verbosity, placed him in the front rank of Bible commentators of the geonic period (see Bacher, Abraham ibn Ezra's Einleitung zu Seinem Pentateuch-Commentar, etc., p.18). In modern times his significance as a Bible exegete has been given proper appreciation through Harkavy's studies of the manuscripts in the St. Petersburg Library (see Berliner's Magazin, v. 14 <b>et</b> <b>seq.,</b> 57 et seq.; Harkavy, l.c. i., iii.; Steinschneider, Hebr. Bibl. xx. 132 <b>et</b> <b>seq.).</b>|$|E
25|$|So did the {{followers}} of Obadiah Abu-Isa, the Isawites, and of Judah Yudghan, the Yudghanites, {{at the close of}} the 7th century and at the beginning of the 8th, the forerunners of the Karaites, and many prominent Karaites themselves lead ascetic lives; abstaining from meat and wine, and spending much of their time in meditation and devotion, partly in order to obtain a deeper knowledge of the Scriptures, partly as mourners over Jerusalem (see Shahrastani, Book of Religions and Philosophical Sects, Haarbrücker's translation, i. 254-257; H. Grätz, Gesch. der Juden, iii. 417 <b>et</b> <b>seq.,</b> 446 et seq.; Jost, Gesch. des Judenthums, ii. 350 <b>et</b> <b>seq.).</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{story of}} Hanukkah is alluded {{to in the}} book of 1 Maccabees and 2 Maccabees. The eight-day rededication of the temple is {{described}} in 1 Maccabees 4:36 <b>et</b> <b>seq,</b> though the name of the festival and the miracle of the lights do not appear here. A story similar in character, and obviously older in date, is the one alluded to in 2 Maccabees 1:18 <b>et</b> <b>seq</b> according to which the relighting of the altar fire by Nehemiah was due to a miracle which occurred on the 25th of Kislev, and which appears to be given as the reason for the selection of the same date for the rededication of the altar by Judah Maccabee.|$|E
25|$|Chapter VII {{raises the}} issue of whether {{different}} races have similar diseases (p162 <b>et</b> <b>seq)</b> and ends with a list of reasons for placing man in one distinct species. The reasons are mostly anatomical with some behavioural, such as speech. They remain valid today.|$|E
25|$|Les Rois maudits or The Accursed Kings (1973 <b>et</b> <b>seq)</b> by Maurice Druon {{depicts the}} death of the last Grand Master of the Order, and plays with the legend of the curse he laid on the pope, Philip the Fair, and Guillaume de Nogaret.|$|E
25|$|Swedish author Jan Guillou {{has written}} a trilogy about Arn Magnusson (1998 <b>et</b> <b>seq),</b> a fictional Swedish {{character}} from the Middle Ages who was forced to become a Knight Templar, went to Jerusalem and after returning to Sweden, was a leading military figure shortly before the time of Birger Jarl.|$|E
25|$|The Persians {{considered}} this Chaldean societal class to be masters {{of reading and}} writing, and especially versed in all forms of incantation, sorcery, witchcraft, and the magical arts. They spoke of astrologists and astronomers as Chaldeans, and it is used with this specific meaning in the Book of Daniel (Dan. i. 4, ii. 2 <b>et</b> <b>seq.)</b> and by classical writers, such as Strabo.|$|E
