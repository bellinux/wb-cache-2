5|$|Rock bands {{have largely}} {{influenced}} the band like the Deftones, Sepultura, Sick of <b>It</b> <b>All,</b> <b>and</b> Snapcase. At an early age, Schwab listened to Slayer, S.O.D., and Metallica. He later discovered East Coast hip hop. During {{the recording of}} Rival Factions, the band took heavy influence from post-punk groups like Depeche Mode, Joy Division, Psychedelic Furs, and The Sisters of Mercy. Some of their favorite bands are The Cure, Portishead, Quicksand, Shiner, and Sunny Day Real Estate.|$|E

But I asked her to sing <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> <b>and</b> she just made up the whole melody on the spot, and sang this amazing solo. At that moment I realised that this girl has a really special gift.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} foods and {{substances}} {{have been found}} to disturb sleep, due to stimulant effects or disruptive digestive demands. Avoiding nicotine, caffeine (including coffee, energy drinks, soft drinks, tea, chocolate, and some pain relievers), and other stimulants in the hours before bedtime is recommended by most sleep hygiene specialists, as these substances activate neurobiological systems that maintain wakefulness. Alcohol near bedtime is frequently discouraged by clinicians, because, although alcohol can induce sleepiness initially, the arousal caused by metabolizing alcohol can disrupt and significantly fragment sleep. Smoking tobacco products before bed is also thought to reduce one's quality of resting by decreasing the time spent in deep sleep, leading to sleep fragmentation and nocturnal restlessness. Both consumption of a large meal just before bedtime, requiring effort to metabolize <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> <b>and</b> hunger have been associated with disrupted sleep; clinicians may recommend eating a light snack before bedtime. Lastly, limiting intake of liquids before bedtime can prevent interruptions due to urinations.|$|E

25|$|The {{desirability}} of hiring directors over 60 is fairly diminished in this marketplace. At the same time, I hadn't had a good-sized hit {{in quite a}} while.

25|$|In {{addition}} to enabling professional advancement, what he encountered in Chicago changed Blount's personal outlook. The city was {{a center of}} African-American political activism and fringe movements, with Black Muslims, Black Hebrews, and others proselytizing, debating, and printing leaflets or books. Blount absorbed <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>and</b> was fascinated with the city's many ancient Egyptian-styled buildings and monuments. He read books such as George G.M. James's Stolen Legacy (which argued that classical Greek philosophy had its roots in ancient Egypt). Blount concluded that the accomplishments and history of Africans had been systematically suppressed and denied by European cultures.|$|E

25|$|Singer-songwriter Björk {{received}} international acclaim for her {{starring role}} in the Danish musical drama Dancer in the Dark directed by Lars von Trier, in which she plays Selma Ježková, a factory worker who struggles {{to pay for her}} son's eye operation.

The Fabulous Kangaroos’ 1965 run in NWA All-Star Wrestling {{turned out to be}} the last time the original Kangaroos teamed together. In June 1965, the Kangaroos lost to Don Leo Jonathan and Jim Hardy and then split up. Heffernan left Australia to tour the world in 1953 and wanted to return to his homeland, while Costello was determined to remain in the United States at least for a while longer.|$|E
25|$|It was in 1943, {{while on}} {{holidays}} in Glengariff, West Cork, that Lynch met his future wife, Máirín O'Connor, {{the daughter of}} a Dublin judge. Lynch was to be her first and only boyfriend, and the couple were married three years later on 10 August 1946. Although she was apprehensive about her husband's decision to become active in politics, to become a Minister and even to become Taoiseach, she stood by him through <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>and</b> helped him make the tough decisions that would affect Lynch's life and her own. One story exists where Lynch, in spite of tremendous pressure from Seán Lemass and the entire Fianna Fáil party to stand for the leadership, only accepted the nomination after Máirín had agreed. The fact that the couple didn't have any children allowed Lynch to embark on a political career, without having to worry about his commitment to the family. However, he remained totally devoted to Máirín throughout his, and she became just as easily recognisable as her husband.|$|E

25|$|Chandragupta Maurya (reign: 321–298 BCE) was {{the founder}} of the Maurya Empire in ancient India. He was born in a humble family, {{orphaned}} and abandoned, raised as a son by another pastoral family, was picked up, taught and counselled by Chanakya, the author of the Arthashastra. Chandragupta thereafter built one of the largest empires ever in the Indian subcontinent. According to Jain sources, he then renounced <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> <b>and</b> became a monk in the Jain tradition. Chandragupta is claimed, by the historic Jain texts, to have followed Jainism in his life, by first renouncing all his wealth and power, going away with Jaina monks into the Deccan region (now Karnataka), and ultimately performing Sallekhana – the Jain religious ritual of peacefully welcoming death by fasting. His grandson was emperor Ashoka, famous for his historic pillars and for his role in helping spread Buddhism outside of ancient India. Chandragupta's life and accomplishments are described in ancient Hindu, Buddhist and Greek texts, but they vary significantly in details from the Jaina accounts. Megasthenes served as a Greek ambassador in his court for four years. In Greek and Latin accounts, Chandragupta is known as Sandrokottos and Androcottus.|$|E
25|$|For {{a number}} of days, Jaynes is forced to labor for his master Augustus by {{cleaning}} his ice cave and kneading krakt (the Snow Honkies' word for whale blubber). Augustus eventually gestures to Jaynes that he wants Little Debbie cakes by showing him an empty wrapper, which leads {{them back to the}} campsite and Garth. Jaynes and Garth then plot an escape plan for the enslaved crew as Augustus eats out of a bag of sugar and eventually falls ill and vomits. Jaynes and Garth drag the Snow Honkie back to the mouth of the ice caves, where they secretly plan to meet with the others. After returning, Augustus (who is translated by Pym) drunkenly announces to Jaynes that he has been sold to Sausage Nose, an abusive master who owns both Jeffree and Carlton. Jaynes realizes that he must escape with the crew soon or they will be enslaved forever. He attempts to convince Booker Jaynes to escape with him and Garth, but fails to persuade him as Booker is in an intimate relationship with his mistress, Hunka. Jaynes manages to escape by himself to the mouth of the cave, but sees that both snowmobiles have been destroyed by Pym. Garth and Jaynes tie Pym up and begin {{to walk away from the}} ice caves with a ration of seasoned krakt from Booker as their own source of food. Garth unfortunately eats <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>and</b> leaves everyone to starve.|$|E

Sepultura wrapped up the year doing a brief German tour with NWOBHM legends Mötorhead and Florida death metal group Morbid Angel in December.|$|E
