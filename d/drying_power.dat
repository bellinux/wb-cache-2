The accuracy of ET estimates from remote sensing-based models of a selected watershed oil 23 June 2005 (DOY 174) presenting large air <b>drying</b> <b>power</b> and marked contrast in underlying surface characteristics, and 25 July 2005, (DOY 206) in contrast to the meteorological and underlying surface conditions of DOY 174, were evaluated in terms of SWAT-based ET. The ET estimates from the two methodologies are shown to be comparable, indicating that S-TSEB has the highest accuracy with relative errors of 2. 2 % and 5. 6 % with reference to SWAT-based ET for DOY 174 and 206, respectively. Hence it was selected to be the basis for performing an intercomparison with other remote sensing-based models. Single-source models are very sensitive to KB(- 1) parameter, rendering marked differences in ET estimate, because of different treatments of roughness length for heat transfer. SEBAL and SEBS yielded mean absolute percentage difference (MAPD) versus S-TSEB within 26. 22 % and 26. 56 % for DOY 174 and within 9. 11 % and 11. 69 % for DOY 206, respectively, indicating their applicability to higher vegetation cover and soil moisture availability areas under small air <b>drying</b> <b>power</b> condition. P-TSEB generated MAPD versus S-TSEB within 41. 15 % for DOY 174 and 8. 79 % for DOY 206. implying that P-TSEB is highly consistent with S-TSEB under small air <b>drying</b> <b>power</b> and less contrast in soil moisture conditions. whereas noticeable discrepancies occur under large air <b>drying</b> <b>power</b> and marked contrast in soil moisture circumstances, in particular for sparse cover.

A dedicated experimental apparatus was built and operated: measurements included the air flow rate, and the input electrical power, while the jet average outlet temperature {{was derived from the}} energy balance. The <b>drying</b> <b>power</b> was estimated by weighing a thin fabric patch before the test and after a prescribed amount of time. Results were compared with available models of jet drying, showing considerable discrepancy especially for high values of input power; the reasons for this discrepancy are at present not fully understood, but can likely be found in a distribution of the temperature of the surface to be dried different from the expected one, that is the adiabatic saturation. Finally, the energetic balance of the system was introduced, and an attempt was made to define an energetic efficiency of the appliance, {{on the basis of the}} energy actually spent for evaporation over the input electrical power.

40|$|Evaporation from nonsaturated {{surfaces}} is investigated. The {{concept of}} potential evaporation is first examined; {{a series of}} definitions are developed and classified, and it is shown {{that the relationship between}} potential and actual evaporation rates depends on the controlling variables in the chosen definition for potential evaporation. Extending the work of Penman (1948) to the unsaturated case, a general equation is derived to describe evaporation from nonsaturated surfaces. Applying Bouchet's (1963) hypothesis with a consistent set of definitions also leads to the same general equation. To account for departures from the saturated condition, the equation makes use of the concept of relative evaporation, the ratio of the actual evaporation rate to the rate which would occur under the prevailing atmospheric conditions if the surface was saturated at the actual surface temperature. A relationship is established between the relative evaporation, G, and a dimensionless parameter called the relative <b>drying</b> <b>power,</b> D, the ratio of the <b>drying</b> <b>power</b> (the evaporation rate which would occur if the surface was saturated at the actual air temperature) to the sum of the <b>drying</b> <b>power</b> and the net available energy. The relationship is non-dimensional and appears to be single-valued. An experimental investigation of evaporation from bare soil and growing wheat is carried out; data from an energy balance installation show that the G-D estimates of evaporation are in close agreement with calculations obtained using the Bowen ratio approach. The data are also used to refine the relationship between relative evaporation and relative <b>drying</b> <b>power.</b> The G-D estimates of evaporation also agree closely with independent estimates obtained from the soil water balance at three sites during the growing season. The combination of this G-D relationship with the derived general evaporation equation constitutes a simple model for obtaining estimates of evaporation from nonsaturated surfaces; no prior estimate of the potential evaporation is required, and the surface conditions of temperature and humidity need not be known. A preliminary relationship is found for the vapour transfer coefficient (used in a Dalton type transfer equation) for daily time periods. Algorithms are presented for the estimation of daily net radiation and for soil heat flux. A new approach is proposed for the application of remotely-sensed surface temperature data to the estimate of regional evaporation. A relationship is derived between the surface temperature and the vapour pressure deficit in the air. The relationship allows for the use of remotely-sensed data in evaporation models such as that presented above. The method is shown to provide superior results to the simplified energy balance approach currently being applied...|$|E
40|$|The Budyko {{functions}} B- 1 (Phi(p)) are dimensionless relationships {{relating the}} ratio E/P (actual evaporation over precipitation) to the aridity index Phi(p) = E-p/P (potential evaporation over precipitation). They are valid at catchment scale with E-p generally defined by Penman's equation. The complementary evaporation (CE) relationship stipulates that a decreasing actual evaporation enhances potential evaporation through the <b>drying</b> <b>power</b> {{of the air}} which becomes higher. The Turc-Mezentsev function with its shape parameter lambda, chosen as example among various Budyko functions, is matched with the CE relationship, implemented through a generalised form of the advection-aridity model.

For the two functions B- 1 (Phi(p)) and B- 1 '(Phi(0)) to be equivalent, the Priestley-Taylor coefficient alpha(0) should have a specified value {{as a function of the}} Turc-Mezentsev shape parameter and the aridity index.

40|$|Bouchet in 1963 {{hypothesized}} that for large homogeneous land surface with minimum advection {{of heat and}} moisture, there exists a 1 : 1 complementary relationship of potential and actual evaporation coupled through land-atmosphere feedbacks. The complementary relationship has been widely used to estimate regional actual evaporation and explain the pan evaporation paradox. We examine the standardized potential evaporation (potential evaporation divided by wet environment evaporation) at 102 observatories at different elevations across China. Generally, the relationship is appropriate at the low elevations (< 1000 m). With the increase of elevation, vapor transfer power becomes much less than radiation energy budget because of lower vapor pressure deficit and stronger global solar radiation. As a result, at the high elevations (over 1000 m), the excess energy resulted by limited moisture availability {{is not enough to}} be converted into <b>drying</b> <b>power</b> of the air.

30|$|Linseed oil has the {{capacity}} to form a continuous film with good optical and mechanical properties after being spread out in a thin layer (Lazzari & Chiantore 1999). It will cure in air without using a catalyst, although slowly (Marshall 1986). The double bonds of the unsaturated acids in the oil react with oxygen in air and with one another to form a polymeric network (Lazzari & Chiantore 1999; Stava et al. 2007) that determines the <b>drying</b> <b>power</b> of such oils (Lazzari & Chiantore 1999), resulting in the liquid layer evolving to a solid film (Roberfroid & Calderon 1995; Marshall 1986). Thus, this hardening process arises {{as a result of the}} autoxidation followed by cross-linking polymerisation (Lazzari & Chiantore 1999; Fjällström et al. 2002; Tanase et al. 2004). The formation of cross linked structures essentially consists of the intermolecular coupling of radicals originated by decomposition of the relatively unstable peroxide groups (Lazzari & Chiantore 1999). The drying reaction of linseed oil continues for many years even when the oil film seems to completely dry in a few days (Lazzari & Chiantore 1999). However, the presence of glycerides as plasticisers can moderate the hardening process (Lazzari & Chiantore 1999).

The Dalton-type bulk transfer (BT) approach typically applied in land surface schemes considers turbulent transfer along the humidity gradient between the surface and atmosphere as diagnosed from the land surface temperature.

The models were evaluated for several temporal scales from 15 min to seasonal, and compared with measured evaporation data obtained by an eddy covariance system. Results suggest that all three approaches have ‘reasonable ’ applicability for estimating evaporation at point-scales for periods longer than daily, but none of the methods provide consistently reliable daily or sub-daily estimates of evaporation.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to achieve improved control of the micro-climate around the mushroom crop. The work was based on two approaches. One, which required the greater part of the work, was gaining an understanding of the characteristics/physics of the climate control system as a whole within mushroom tunnels and the other was the application of modern control strategies to manipulate more effectively the conditions at the cropping surface. The work showed that the influences of the operation of the air conditioning on the crop micro-climate was far greater than the expected adjustment of, say, temperature and that novel systems and improved measurement of the micro-climate were required in order to optimise the control of air conditions. The operation of the heating system caused a load dependent, i. e. seasonal, variation in the average <b>drying</b> <b>power</b> of the air at the crop. While heating (on/off control) was in operation, air flow effectively ceased at the cropping surface and the effect persisted {{for the duration of the}} heating and a recovery period afterwards. Various simple strategies could be implemented to minimise these effects but a novel design for air distribution provided a means of eliminating the effect. Because of the complex relationship between the delivery of conditioned air and the consequent flow at the cropping surface, improved feedback from the crop micro-climate was found to be essential for improved control. A new sensor was developed in conjunction with the Department of Electronic Engineering, NUI Galway that provided a low cost measurement of the very low air speeds used in mushroom growing. The Irish mushroom-growing system (bags and tunnels) offers more potential for accurate control than other, tiered, growing systems. The goal of the second aspect of this project was the provision of an accurate and robust control system for mushroom tunnels. Work focused on the control relationships between inputs and outputs of the system. A Teagasc Walsh Fellowship supported the early work which was carried out in conjunction with the Department of Electronic Engineering at NUI, Galway. Initial work prior to this project, with control specialists in DIT, Kevin Street College of Technology, was extended to provide a mathematical/control model of the main physical processes involved.

50|$|Lowering fan {{pressure}} ratio decreases specific thrust (both dry and wet afterburning), but {{results in a}} lower temperature entering the afterburner. Since the afterburning exit temperature is effectively fixed, the temperature rise across the unit increases, raising the afterburner fuel flow. The total fuel flow tends to increase faster than the net thrust, resulting in a higher specific fuel consumption (SFC). However, the corresponding <b>dry</b> <b>power</b> SFC improves (i.e. lower specific thrust). The high temperature ratio across the afterburner results in a good thrust boost.|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} the static test facility of the Langley 16 -foot transonic tunnel to determine the internal performance of a hybrid axisymmetric/nonaxisymmetric nozzle in forward-thrust mode. Nozzle cross-sections in the spherical convergent section were axisymmetric whereas cross-sections in the divergent flap area nonaxisymmetric (two-dimensional). Nozzle concepts simulating <b>dry</b> and afterburning <b>power</b> settings were investigated. Both subsonic cruise and supersonic cruise expansion ratios were tested for the <b>dry</b> <b>power</b> nozzle concepts. Afterburning power configurations were tested at an expansion ratio typical for subsonic acceleration. The spherical convergent flaps were designed {{in such a way}} that the transition from axisymmetric to nonaxisymmetric cross-section occurred in the region of the nozzle throat. Three different nozzle throat geometries were tested for each nozzle power setting. High-pressure air was used to simulate jet exhaust at nozzle pressure ratios up to 12. 0...|$|R
