5|$|Bresnahan {{was elected}} to the Hall of Fame the year after his death. He had {{received}} 47 votes of the 226 electors in the 1936 Hall of Fame balloting, and between 43 and 67 votes each time from 1937 through 1942. In the 1945 balloting, occurring one month after Bresnahan's death, he received 133 votes, still falling short of enshrinement. However, the Permanent Committee noticed the surge in votes and <b>elected</b> <b>him</b> in April 1945.|$|E
5|$|Congress {{declared}} war in June 1812, and after its adjournment, Johnson returned to Kentucky to recruit volunteers. So many men responded that he chose only those with horses, {{and raised a}} body of mounted rifles. Johnson recruited 300 men, divided into three companies, who <b>elected</b> <b>him</b> major. They merged with another battalion, forming a regiment of 500 men, with Johnson as colonel.|$|E
5|$|During his pontificate Innocent XIII {{had only}} created three new cardinals. When he died the {{composition}} of the College of Cardinals and its factions were similar to the one that had <b>elected</b> <b>him.</b> The conclave began on 20 March 1724 with only 33 cardinal electors present, but eventually 53 total cardinals took part in the election.|$|E

60|$|So {{when they}} got {{the news that the}} king had lost {{confidence}} in John Henry Bagshaw, the sitting member, they never questioned it a bit. Lost confidence? All right, they'd <b>elect</b> <b>him</b> another right away. They'd <b>elect</b> <b>him</b> half a dozen if he needed them. They don't mind; they'd elect the whole town man after man rather than have the king worried about it.|$|R

5|$|However, on 14 March, Malenkov {{resigned}} from the secretariat of the Central Committee. This came due to concerns that he was acquiring too much power. The major beneficiary was Khrushchev. His name appeared atop a revised list of secretaries—indicating that he was {{now in charge of}} the party. The Central Committee formally <b>elected</b> <b>him</b> First Secretary in September.|$|E
5|$|James Paul Gannon (born 7 September 1968) is {{a former}} footballer who is now manager of National League North side Stockport County. He started and {{finished}} {{his career as a}} player in Ireland, but made most of his professional appearances in the English Football League at Stockport County, where supporters <b>elected</b> <b>him</b> {{as a member of the}} Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald {{was born}} in Scotland; {{when he was a}} boy his family immigrated to Kingston in the Province of Upper Canada (today in eastern Ontario). As a lawyer he was {{involved}} in several high-profile cases and quickly became prominent in Kingston, which <b>elected</b> <b>him</b> in 1844 to the legislature of the Province of Canada. By 1857, he had become premier under the colony's unstable political system.|$|E

5|$|Sigismund Báthory abdicated at the Diet in Medgyes (Mediaș, Romania) on 21 March and {{proposed}} Andrew his successor. After Andrew pledged that {{neither he nor}} his brother would take vengeance on those who had voted against them in 1594, the Diet <b>elected</b> <b>him</b> prince on 28 March. However, as Alfonso Carillo noted, the most influential noblemen remained opposed to Andrew, even if they did not dare to raise an objection openly.|$|E
5|$|York-born William Etty (1787–1849) had {{originally}} been an apprentice printer in Hull, but on completing his apprenticeship {{at the age of}} 18 moved to London to become an artist. Strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens, he became famous for painting nude figures in biblical, literary and mythological settings. While many of his peers greatly admired him and <b>elected</b> <b>him</b> a full Royal Academician in 1828, others condemned the content of his work as indecent.|$|E
5|$|After seeing Toulmin's {{letters of}} {{recommendation}} from Jefferson and Madison, {{the board of}} trustees of Transylvania Seminary (now Transylvania University) in Lexington, Kentucky, <b>elected</b> <b>him</b> president of the seminary in February 1794. He was the first president of the seminary who was not a Presbyterian, and his election was effected when the Baptist and more liberal members of the board united against the more conservative Presbyterian members. His Unitarian views offended many of the conservative board members, and at their insistence, the Kentucky General Assembly passed legislation requiring a unanimous vote of the board of regents to re-elect the seminary's president. Toulmin resigned in protest in April 1796.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Harrison {{moved to}} Ohio, {{where he was}} elected to the United States House of Representatives. In 1824, the state {{legislature}} <b>elected</b> <b>him</b> to the United States Senate. He served a truncated term after being appointed as Minister Plenipotentiary to Gran Colombia in May 1828. In Santa Fe de Bogotá, he spoke with president Simón Bolívar, urging Bolívar to guide his nation toward American-style democracy. Harrison returned to private life on his farm in Ohio until he was nominated for the presidency as one of several Whig Party candidates in the election of 1836. He received more votes than any other Whig, but was defeated by Democrat Martin Van Buren, and returned again to his farm.|$|E
5|$|All the {{criminal}} proceedings against him were canceled and {{the charges of}} blasphemy were officially withdrawn. Alcibiades was able to assert his piety and to raise Athenian morale by leading the solemn procession to Eleusis (for {{the celebration of the}} Eleusinian Mysteries) by land {{for the first time since}} the Spartans had occupied Decelea. The procession had been replaced by a journey by sea, but this year Alcibiades used a detachment of soldiers to escort the traditional procession. His property was restored and the ecclesia <b>elected</b> <b>him</b> supreme commander of land and sea (strategos autokrator).|$|E
5|$|Blaine {{received}} {{the news at}} his home in Washington and telegraphed Hayes his congratulations. In the subsequent contest of 1876, Hayes was elected after a contentious compromise over disputed electoral votes. The results of the convention had further effects on Blaine’s political career, as Bristow, having lost the nomination, also resigned as Treasury Secretary three days after the convention ended. President Grant selected Senator Lot M. Morrill of Maine to fill the cabinet post, and Maine’s governor, Seldon Connor, appointed Blaine to the now-vacant Senate seat. When the Maine Legislature reconvened that autumn, they confirmed Blaine’s appointment and <b>elected</b> <b>him</b> to the full six-year term that would begin on March 4, 1877.|$|E

5|$|Following the war, Isaac Shelby {{relocated}} to Kentucky, on lands awarded {{to him for}} his military service, and became involved in Kentucky's transition from a county of Virginia, to a separate state. His heroism made him popular with the state's citizens and the Kentucky electoral college unanimously <b>elected</b> <b>him</b> governor in 1792. He secured Kentucky, from Indian attacks and organized its first government. He used the Citizen Genet affair to convince the Washington administration to make {{an agreement with the}} Spanish for free trade on the Mississippi River.|$|E
5|$|In 1884, McCreary {{was elected}} to the first of six {{consecutive}} terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. As a legislator, he was an advocate of free silver and a champion of the state's agricultural interests. After two failed bids for election to the Senate, McCreary secured the support of Governor J. C. W. Beckham, and in 1902, the General Assembly <b>elected</b> <b>him</b> to the Senate. He served one largely undistinguished term, and Beckham successfully challenged him for his Senate seat in 1908. The divide between McCreary and Beckham was short-lived, however, and Beckham supported McCreary's election to a second term as governor in 1911.|$|E
5|$|Johnson helped {{organize}} a mechanics' (working men's) ticket in the 1829 Greeneville municipal election. He was elected town alderman, {{along with his}} friends Blackston McDannel and Mordecai Lincoln. Following the 1831 Nat Turner slave rebellion, a state convention was called to pass a new constitution, including provisions to disenfranchise free people of color. The convention also wanted to reform real estate tax rates, and provide ways of funding improvements to Tennessee's infrastructure. The constitution was submitted for a public vote, and Johnson spoke widely for its adoption; the successful campaign provided him with statewide exposure. On January 4, 1834, his fellow aldermen <b>elected</b> <b>him</b> mayor of Greeneville.|$|E

5|$|Many noblemen joined Charles of Naples who marched towards Buda. Mary and {{her mother}} {{received}} him ceremoniously before he reached Buda, and he entered the capital in the two queens' company in early December 1385. Mary renounced the crown without resistance {{in the middle of}} December out of fear that Charles would kill her. Charles first adopted the title governor, but the Diet <b>elected</b> <b>him</b> king. Charles was crowned king of Hungary in Székesfehérvár on 31December. According to the contemporaneous Lorenzo de Monacis, Mary {{and her mother}}, who attended Charles's coronation, visited Louis the Great's tomb during the ceremony where they burst into tears because of their ill fate.|$|E
5|$|Over Ross's protests, {{the men of}} the Sixth Regiment <b>elected</b> <b>him</b> {{colonel in}} 1862. He did not want the {{responsibility}} of the position and had not wanted to embarrass a friend who wanted the job. Their brigade commander, General Charles W. Phifer, was often absent, leaving Ross in charge. Ross's actions impressed other officers, and several times during the summer of 1862, he was nominated for promotion to brigadier general. Although he was not promoted at that time, his unit {{was the only one of}} the 810 dismounted cavalry units in the area to be promised the return of their horses.|$|E
5|$|Vermigli {{was ordained}} in 1525 and {{probably}} received his Doctor of Divinity around that time. The chapter-general of the Congregation <b>elected</b> <b>him</b> {{to the office}} of public preacher in 1526. His first series of sermons was in Brescia later that year. He then preached for three years, travelling around northern and central Italy. Unlike the practice of other preaching orders which usually only preached at Lent and Advent, the Augustinians preached year-round. He also gave lectures on the Bible as well as Homer in Lateran Congregation houses.|$|E
