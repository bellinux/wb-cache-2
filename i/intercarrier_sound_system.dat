50|$|The {{video carrier}} is {{demodulated}} {{to give a}} composite video signal; this contains luminance, chrominance and synchronization signals; this {{is identical to the}} video signal format used by analog video devices such as VCRs or CCTV cameras. Note that the RF signal modulation is inverted compared to the conventional AM: the minimum video signal level corresponds to maximum carrier amplitude, and vice versa. To ensure good linearity (fidelity), consistent with affordable manufacturing costs of transmitters and receivers, the video carrier is never shut off altogether. When <b>intercarrier</b> <b>sound</b> was invented later in 1948, not completely shutting off the carrier had the side effect of allowing <b>intercarrier</b> <b>sound</b> to be economically implemented.|$|R
50|$|At {{this point}} the IF signal {{consists}} of a video carrier signal at one frequency and the sound carrier at a fixed offset. A demodulator recovers the video signal. Also at {{the output of the}} same demodulator is a new frequency modulated sound carrier at the offset frequency. In some sets made before 1948, this was filtered out, and the sound IF of about 22 MHz was sent to an FM demodulator to recover the basic sound signal. In newer sets, this new carrier at the offset frequency was allowed to remain as <b>intercarrier</b> <b>sound,</b> and it was sent to an FM demodulator to recover the basic sound signal. One particular advantage of <b>intercarrier</b> <b>sound</b> is that when the front panel fine tuning knob is adjusted, the sound carrier frequency does not change with the tuning, but stays at the above-mentioned offset frequency. Consequently, it is easier to tune the picture without losing the sound.|$|R

50|$|The <b>sound</b> <b>system</b> concept {{originated}} in the 1950s in Kingston, Jamaica. DJs would load up a truck with a generator, turntables, and huge speakers to set up street parties. The <b>sound</b> <b>system</b> scene is generally regarded as {{an important part of}} Jamaican cultural history and as being responsible for the rise of modern Jamaican musical styles such as ska, rocksteady, reggae and dub. When Jamaicans emigrated to the United Kingdom, the <b>sound</b> <b>system</b> culture followed and became firmly rooted there in the 1970s. It is still strongly linked with those Jamaican-originated music genres, and some bands or producers still call themselves <b>sound</b> <b>systems,</b> such as Dub Narcotic <b>Sound</b> <b>System</b> and the On-U <b>Sound</b> <b>System.</b> When Asian Dub Foundation are advertised as Asian Dub Foundation, the whole band performs, but when they announce themselves as Asian Dub Foundation <b>Sound</b> <b>System,</b> members of the band mix and play music (by other artists, as well as their own) while one or two MCs rap over the songs like DJ Pro. The term also has become connected with <b>sound</b> reinforcement <b>systems</b> by DJs such as the Valve <b>Sound</b> <b>System.</b>|$|R

50|$|As <b>sound</b> <b>systems</b> {{continued}} to gain in popularity through the 1960s and 1970s, they became politicized in many instances.
