50|$|At Doubleday, Congdon {{had read}} {{a number of}} {{articles}} written by Peter Benchley and <b>invited</b> Benchley <b>to</b> <b>lunch</b> <b>to</b> discuss some ideas for books. Benchley {{wanted to write a}} non-fiction book about pirates, but Congdon wasn't interested. Congdon asked if he had any ideas for fiction, and Benchley respond with his idea of a novel about a great white shark terrorizing a beach resort. Congdon offered Benchley an advance of $1,000, leading to the novelist submitting the first 100 pages. After extensive rewriting based on Congdon's guidance, Jaws was published in 1974 and stayed on the bestseller list for some 44 weeks.|$|R

Next day a {{consignment}} of hens arrives, and they spend some busy days putting up fences and building coops; Ukridge buys various supplies on credit, and begins to arrange to supply eggs to various outlets. One day, chasing an escaped hen, Garnet tumbles into a garden containing the girl from the train, her father Professor Derrick, and a friendly young navy lieutenant named Tom Chase, whose familiarity with Phyllis irks Garnet.

50|$|The Ghost of Christmas Past {{appears as}} a taxi driver who takes Frank back to his childhood, {{beginning}} in 1955. His father Earl is an unloving meatpacking foreman who gives him veal for Christmas and yells at him when he objects. Frank's only solace is {{in the world of}} television, foreshadowing his eventual career path. The Ghost then takes Frank forward to 1968-71 to see himself as a young man meeting Claire, and showing how Frank's rise to power changed his emotional life, and that Frank is to blame for the loss of Claire. Returned to the present, Frank goes to the homeless shelter to apologize <b>to</b> Claire and <b>invites</b> her <b>to</b> <b>lunch</b> <b>to</b> mend fences. However, when shelter workers pester Claire, Frank reverts to his old self, and bluntly tells Claire she is letting life pass her by, and to only care about herself.|$|R
5|$|Shortly after Hitler {{had come}} into power, he had started to make plans to rebuild the chancellery. At the end of 1933 he {{contracted}} Paul Troost to renovate the entire building. Hitler appointed Speer, whose work for Goebbels had impressed him, to manage the building site for Troost. As Chancellor, Hitler had a residence in the building and came by every day to be briefed by Speer and the building supervisor {{on the progress of}} the renovations. After one of these briefings, Hitler <b>invited</b> Speer <b>to</b> <b>lunch,</b> <b>to</b> the architect's great excitement. Hitler evinced considerable interest in Speer during the luncheon, and later told Speer that he had been looking for a young architect capable of carrying out his architectural dreams for the new Germany. Speer quickly became part of Hitler's inner circle; he was expected to call on Hitler in the morning for a walk or chat, to provide consultation on architectural matters, and to discuss Hitler's ideas. Most days he was <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> dinner.|$|R
5000|$|Rich {{served as}} chief theatre critic of The New York Times from 1980 to 1993, earning the {{nickname}} [...] "Butcher of Broadway" [...] for his {{power over the}} prospects of Broadway shows. He first won attention from theatre-goers with an essay for The Harvard Crimson about the Broadway musical Follies (1971), by Stephen Sondheim, during its pre-Broadway tryout run in Boston. In {{his study of the}} work, Rich was [...] "the first person to predict the legendary status the show eventually would achieve". The article [...] "fascinated" [...] Harold Prince, the musical's co-director, and [...] "absolutely intrigued" [...] Sondheim, who <b>invited</b> the undergraduate <b>to</b> <b>lunch</b> <b>to</b> further discuss his feelings about the production.|$|R
5000|$|Wakeman's {{new idea}} was well {{received}} by the three record companies, and was asked to produce a demo tape of some songs, narration, and orchestral parts. However, a problem arose when Wakeman was asked about his backing band as he wished for them or the orchestra not to be restricted to one style, and in his mind saw each group perform a variety of styles, playing [...] "rock things, heavy metal ... I want the band playing a classical thing". Despite being told {{to continue with the}} demo regardless, Wakeman expressed some concern about whether his idea was understood properly by the labels; his two eldest sons, Oliver and Adam Wakeman, advised him not to do the album if it could not be produced to his liking. Wakeman came close to shelving the entire project until Nic Caciappo, an editor of the Yes information service and magazine in California, told his friend Dwight Dereiter of EMI-Capitol at a dinner about Wakeman's problem. A synopsis of the album was sent to Dereiter, who liked it and forwarded it to the European office of EMI Classics, the label's classical music division, as he thought they would understand it better. With further assistance from Frank Rodgers of the music publisher The Product Exchange who soon took over as management for the project, the idea arrived at label president Richard Lyttelton, who <b>invited</b> Wakeman <b>to</b> <b>lunch</b> <b>to</b> discuss the album further in February 1998. Lyttleton supported Wakeman's idea and offered of a recording contract, agreeing to put a further £100,000 into the budget and release the album, to which Wakeman accepted.|$|R
60|$|It {{would be}} {{interesting}} to know to what extent the work of authors is influenced by their private affairs. If life is flowing smoothly, are the novels they write in that period of content coloured with optimism? And if things are running crosswise, do they work off the resultant gloom on their faithful public? If, for instance, Mr. W. W. Jacobs had toothache, would he write like Hugh Walpole? If Maxim Gorky were <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> <b>lunch</b> by Trotsky, <b>to</b> meet Lenin, would he sit down and dash off a trifle in the vein of Stephen Leacock? Probably the eminent have the power of detaching their writing self from their living, work-a-day self; but, for my own part, the frame of mind in which I now found myself had a disastrous effect on my novel that was to be. I had designed it as a light comedy effort. Here and there a page or two to steady the reader and show him what I could do in the way of pathos if I cared to try; but in the main a thing of sunshine and laughter. But now great slabs of gloom began to work themselves into the scheme of it. A magnificent despondency became its keynote. It would not do. I felt that I must make a resolute effort to shake off my depression. More than ever the need of conciliating the professor was borne in upon me. Day and night I spurred my brain to think of some suitable means of engineering a reconciliation.|$|R
6000|$|In this taciturn {{condition}} of affairs it chanced that Winifred <b>invited</b> them <b>to</b> <b>lunch</b> and <b>to</b> go afterward to [...] "a most amusing little play, 'The Beggar's Opera'" [...] and would they bring {{a man to}} make four? Soames, whose attitude toward theatres {{was to go to}} nothing, accepted, because Fleur's attitude was to go to everything. They motored up, taking Michael Mont, who, being in his seventh heaven, was found by Winifred [...] "very amusing." [...] "The Beggar's Opera" [...] puzzled Soames. The people were very unpleasant, the whole thing very cynical. Winifred was [...] "intrigued"--by the dresses. The music, too, did not displease her. At the Opera, the night before, she had arrived too early for the Russian Ballet, and found the stage occupied by singers, for a whole hour pale or apoplectic from terror lest by some dreadful inadvertence they might drop into a tune. Michael Mont was enraptured with the whole thing. And all three wondered what Fleur was thinking of it. But Fleur was not thinking of it. Her fixed idea stood on the stage and sang with Polly Peachum, mimed with Filch, danced with Jenny Diver, postured with Lucy Lockit, kissed, trolled, and cuddled with Macheath. Her lips might smile, her hands applaud, but the comic old masterpiece made no more impression on her than if it had been pathetic, like a modern [...] "Revue." [...] When they embarked in the car to return, she ached because Jon was not sitting next her instead of Michael Mont. When, at some jolt, the young man's arm touched hers as if by accident, she only thought: 'If that were Jon's arm!' When his cheerful voice, tempered by her proximity, murmured above the sound of the car's progress, she smiled and answered, thinking: 'If that were Jon's voice!' and when once he said, [...] "Fleur, you look a perfect angel in that dress!" [...] she answered, [...] "Oh, do you like it?" [...] thinking, 'If only Jon could see it!' ...|$|R
