25|$|The native {{file format}} for QuickTime video, QuickTime File Format, {{specifies}} a multimedia container file that contains {{one or more}} tracks, each of which stores {{a particular type of}} data: audio, video, effects, or text (e.g. for subtitles). Each track either contains a <b>digitally</b> <b>encoded</b> media stream (using a specific format) or a data reference to the media stream located in another file. The ability to contain abstract data references for the media data, and the separation of the media data from the media offsets and the track edit lists means that QuickTime is particularly suited for editing, as it is capable of importing and editing in place (without data copying).|$|E
2500|$|The Media Center is a [...] {{facility}} {{located on}} the ground floor of Xavier Hall that houses the Film Television and Media Arts major (FTM), the Campus Television Network, and the student run HAM Channel. It operates a [...] television production satellite uplink truck that can transmit and receive <b>digitally</b> <b>encoded</b> television signals from geostationary domestic satellites. Fairfield is one of few colleges in the nation to have this technology allowing campus programming and international news organizations including CNN, MSNBC, Fox News and Bloomberg Television to be broadcast worldwide from the University.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{in larger}} productions, {{the team of}} {{directors}} had to assume numerous roles during the independent production, some of which included the transportation of furniture and buying drinking water for the crew during the shoot.

[...] After the filming was complete, the movie was <b>digitally</b> <b>encoded</b> in New York and digitally projected at a number of select cinemas.|$|E
50|$|Magnetic tape {{can also}} be destabilized by {{magnetic}} remanence decay, which refers to the weakening of the tape’s magnetization over time. This weakens the affect tape’s readability, leading to reduced sound clarity and volume or picture hue and contrast. Baking the tape will not restore magnetization. Archivists might instead <b>digitally</b> <b>encode</b> {{a copy of the}} tape, preserving its content as a digital data file.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} way to <b>digitally</b> <b>encode</b> audio signals is pulse-code modulation (PCM), {{which is used}} on audio CDs, DAT recordings, and so on. Digitization transforms continuous signals into discrete ones by sampling a signal's amplitude at uniform intervals and rounding to the nearest value representable with the available number of bits. This process is fundamentally inexact, and involves two errors: discretization error, from sampling at intervals, and quantization error, from rounding.|$|R
5000|$|Molecular {{communications}} systems use {{the presence or}} absence of a selected type of molecule to <b>digitally</b> <b>encode</b> messages. The molecules are delivered into communications media such as air and water for transmission.

Molecular communication signals can be made biocompatible and require very little energy ...|$|R
2500|$|As DAB {{requires}} {{digital signal}} processing techniques to convert from the received <b>digitally</b> <b>encoded</b> signal to the analogue audio content, {{the complexity of the}} electronic circuitry required to do this is higher. [...] This translates into needing more power to effect this conversion than compared to an analogue FM to audio conversion, meaning that portable receiving equipment will tend to have a shorter battery life, or require higher power (and hence more bulk). This means that they use more energy than analogue Band II VHF receivers. However, thanks to increased integration (radio-on-chip), DAB receiver power usage is getting closer to that of FM receivers. For example, NXP Semiconductors N.V. is producing both FM only and FM+DAB radio-on-chip, with similar power consumption.|$|E
2500|$|According {{to another}} school of thought, {{language}} evolved from mimesis— the [...] "acting out" [...] of scenarios using vocal and gestural pantomime. For {{as long as}} utterances needed to be emotionally expressive and convincing, {{it was not possible}} to complete the transition to purely conventional signs. On this assumption, pre-linguistic gestures and vocalisations would have been required not just to disambiguate intended meanings, but also to inspire confidence in their intrinsic reliability. If contractual commitments were necessary in order to inspire community-wide trust in communicative intentions, it would follow that these had to be in place before humans could shift at last to an ultra-efficient, high-speed— digital as opposed to analog— signalling format. Vocal distinctive features (sound contrasts) are ideal for this purpose. It is therefore suggested that the establishment of contractual understandings enabled the decisive transition from mimetic gesture to fully conventionalised, <b>digitally</b> <b>encoded</b> speech.|$|E

50|$|The {{advent of}} digital {{television}} makes pirate television broadcasting more difficult. Channels are broadcast {{as part of}} a multiplex that carries several channels in one signal, and {{it is almost impossible to}} insert an unauthorized channel into an authorized multiplex, or to re-activate an off-air channel. In order to broadcast an unauthorized digital TV channel, not only must the perpetrator build or obtain a VHF/UHF transmitter, he must also build or obtain, and configure, the equipment and software to <b>digitally</b> <b>encode</b> the signal and then create a stand-alone multiplex to carry it.|$|R

According to GMA Network Chairman and CEO, Felipe Gozon, the network will conclude the test phase, and it is expected to begin the rollout of the DTTV project starting in Metro Manila.|$|R
40|$|Provided is {{a system}} and method of <b>digitally</b> <b>encoding</b> and {{decoding}} digital data during the transmission process {{using a combination of}} Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) and turbo coding. A DSSS de-spreading process is used in place of the outer decoder functional block of a turbo decoder, which removes the need for a dedicated outer ECC code. Removal of the dedicated outer ECC code allows for an increase in the actual data rate transmitted through the channel (compared with a system which uses a discrete DSSS stage after Turbo coding or some other ECC code) because the number of bits to be transmitted for a given data rate has been reduced...|$|R

5000|$|AT&T held {{a patent}} (US Patent No. 4472832) {{on a program}} that could <b>digitally</b> <b>encode</b> and {{compress}} recorded speech on a computer.

Microsoft shipped abroad a [...] "master version" [...] of Windows, either on a disk or via encrypted electronic transmission, to foreign manufacturers. These manufacturers first used the master version of Windows to generate copies, and then installed the copies onto the computers they sold to users abroad. AT&T accused Microsoft of infringing U.S. Patent Re. 32580, which was a reissue of U.S. Patent No. 4472832, and filed a suit charging Microsoft with liability for the foreign replications and installations of Windows.|$|R
40|$|An {{airborne}} DCP Data Aquisition System {{has been}} designed to augment the ERTS satellite data recovery system. The DCP's are data collection platforms located at pertinent sites. With the appropriate sensors they are able to collect, <b>digitally</b> <b>encode</b> and transmit environmental parameters to the ERTS satellite. The satellite in turn relays these transmissions to a ground station for processing. The satellite is available for such relay duty a minimum of two times in a 24 -hour period. The equipment is to obtain continuous DCP data during periods of unusual environmental activity [...] storms, floods, etc. Two circumstances contributed to the decision to design such a system; (1) Wallops Station utilizes surveillance aircraft in support of rocket launches and also in support of earth resources activities; (2) the area in which Wallops is located, the Delaware and Chesapeake Bay areas, are fertile areas for DCP usage. Therefore, by developing an airborne DCP receiving station and installing it on aircraft more continuous DCP data can be provided from sites in the surrounding areas at relatively low cost...|$|R

40|$|Digital imaging {{companies}} lose revenue {{each year}} {{to people who are}} illegally copying and&# 13; using their images. One prevention mechanism is to <b>digitally</b> <b>encode</b> images making it difficult for&# 13; others to copy. This could be done using digital fingerprinting or simply adding a visible watermark. &# 13; The information is hidden in a way that should not attract attention, but make it very difficult to make&# 13; an exact replica of the image. The information is encoded within a host image, so that the actual&# 13; appearance of the image does not change, but within the image there is a watermark or secret message,&# 13; which prohibits the attacker from making an exact copy. The objective with Steganography is not to&# 13; change the actual message, or make it difficult to read, as cryptography does, rather to hide the&# 13; existence of the message without distorting the carrier or the actual information. This study presents&# 13; the results of implementing a Least Significant Bit (LSB) digital watermarking system. </font...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a robust programmable analog Gaussian noise generator suitable for mixed-signal test applications. Unlike conventional methods, noise generators employing a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) or resistor thermal noise amplification techniques, the user has full {{control over the}} characteristics of the Gaussian signal. Indeed, the frequency band, the mean, and the variance of the distribution are fully programmable over the voltage range within the supply rails. The method consists of <b>digitally</b> <b>encoding</b> the specified Gaussian signal in a random access memory (RAM), using pulse-density modulation, followed by filtering the output bit stream using an analog low-pass filter. It is demonstrated that the quality of the generated noise signal is independent {{of the quality of the}} filter used; hence, making the noise source highly robust. The output of the noise generator accurately models a real Gaussian signal, even at high sigma values; thus, making it a very effective and predictable dithering signal. Two applications of the proposed Gaussian noise source are demonstrated: histogram testing of analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and high-resolution digitization. In addition, a high-voltage automotive test instrument that supports the high-resolution digitization process proposed is outlined...|$|R

40|$|Laboratory and {{in-flight}} {{experiments were}} conducted to evaluate 3 -D audio display technology for cockpit applications. A 3 -D audio display generator was developed which <b>digitally</b> <b>encodes</b> naturally occurring direction information onto any audio signal and presents the binaural sound over headphones. The acoustic image is stabilized for head movement by use of an electromagnetic head-tracking device. In the laboratory, a 3 -D audio display generator was used to spatially separate competing speech messages to improve the intelligibility of each message. Up to a 25 percent improvement in intelligibility was measured for spatially separated speech at high ambient noise levels (115 dB SPL). During the in-flight experiments, pilots reported that spatial separation of speech communications provided a noticeable improvement in intelligibility. The use of 3 -D audio for target acquisition was also investigated. In the laboratory, 3 -D audio enabled the acquisition of visual targets in about two seconds average response time at 17 degrees accuracy. During the in-flight experiments, pilots correctly identified ground targets 50, 75, and 100 {{percent of the time}} at separation angles of 12, 20, and 35 degrees, respectively.
