5|$|Although Bellone would {{normally}} be much faster than the large British warship, the light winds and Rattlesnakes determined pursuit prevented the privateer from escaping and at 17:00, Powerful {{was close enough to}} open fire. Despite the uneven nature of the combat, Bellone unexpectedly resisted the British attack for another hour and 45 minutes, causing more damage to Powerful than she received herself. The privateer was later taken into British service as a sixth rate frigate and prize money was paid for the captured vessels, but the action prompted questions in subsequent histories about the lack of <b>efficiency</b> <b>in</b> British gunnery.|$|E

5|$|The {{most radical}} {{feature of the}} {{original}} car was its use of flat plate heat exchangers mounted flush {{to the surface of}} the bodywork in place of conventional water radiators. The absence of standard radiators allowed Murray to compensate somewhat for the large engine and fuel tanks and produce a relatively light design with a low frontal cross section (important to reduce drag). In practice the heat exchangers did not provide anything like enough cooling capacity, one of South African Murray’s rare design failures, and were replaced by more standard radiators in the nose of the car, similar to that of the BT45, compromising its aerodynamic <b>efficiency.</b> <b>In</b> addition to the question of drag the nose-mounted radiators moved weight towards the front of the car.|$|E
5|$|While some {{birds are}} {{essentially}} territorial or live in small family groups, other birds may form large flocks. The principal benefits of flocking are safety in numbers and increased foraging efficiency. Defence against predators {{is particularly important}} in closed habitats like forests, where ambush predation is common and multiple eyes can provide a valuable early warning system. This {{has led to the}} development of many mixed-species feeding flocks, which are usually composed of small numbers of many species; these flocks provide safety in numbers but increase potential competition for resources. Costs of flocking include bullying of socially subordinate birds by more dominant birds and the reduction of feeding <b>efficiency</b> <b>in</b> certain cases.|$|E
