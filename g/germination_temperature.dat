50|$|Cucurbita foetidissima {{requires}} {{little water}} and grows best in semiarid and arid environments. Warm weather is required during the five- to eight-month vegetation period. This perennial is well adapted to marginal agricultural lands such as sandy loam soils which {{have to be}} well-drained. <b>Germination</b> <b>temperature</b> range is between 15 °C and 37 °C with an optimum at 25 °C.|$|E
50|$|For propagation, seeds require {{light for}} {{germination}}, so optimal germination occurs when planted no deeper than one-quarter inch (6 mm). Seeds also require a <b>germination</b> <b>temperature</b> of 18-24 C.

50|$|The tree {{is easily}} {{cultivated}} from seed and grows well in colder climates despite its origins. It is adaptable to most dry or moist well-drained soils {{in a sunny}} position and is regarded as hardy, drought and frost tolerant. Although seed can be planted at most {{times of the year}} in Australia it is best sown in spring or autumn in temperate climates. The optimum <b>germination</b> <b>temperature</b> for germination is around 18 to 22 C.|$|E
50|$|Kale {{is usually}} an annual plant grown from seed {{with a wide}} range of <b>germination</b> <b>{{temperatures}}.</b> It is hardy and thrives in wintertime, and can survive in temperatures as low as -15 degrees. Kale can become sweeter after a heavy frost.|$|R
25|$|Most common annual {{vegetables}} have optimal <b>germination</b> <b>temperatures</b> between 75-90 F (24-32 C), {{though many}} species (e.g. radishes or spinach) can germinate at significantly lower temperatures, {{as low as}} 40 F (4 C), thus allowing them to be grown from seeds in cooler climates. Suboptimal temperatures lead to lower success rates and longer germination periods.|$|R
50|$|Seeding optimum <b>germination</b> <b>temperatures</b> {{are between}} 20° and 35°C (68° to 95°F). Germination is delayed at 12°C (54°F), and {{inhibited}} at temperatures lower than 12°C or above 35°C. Thus, {{it is recommended}} to sow in trays and transplant into the field at the two true leaf stage. The best time for transplanting into an open field is in the spring when soil and air temperatures rise to around 15°C (59°F).|$|R
50|$|Phomopsis blight of juniper is most {{aggressive}} during cool, moist weather {{often associated with}} spring. These conditions promote pycnidia to release their spores, which possess an optimal <b>germination</b> <b>temperature</b> range between 24 and 28 degrees Celsius. Continuously wet foliage is needed for infection to occur. Areas with heavy shade and poor drainage allow for moist, slow drying areas for the disease to thrive in. Exposure to 100 percent humidity {{for as little as}} 7 hours can propagate seedlings to be fully infected.|$|E
50|$|Spread {{initially}} in moist conditions, {{the pathogen}} requires physical transport either through mist and rain, or by {{direct contact with}} other infected needles. Once the needles have been exposed and the fungus germinates, the pathogen then penetrates the needle through the stoma. The ideal <b>germination</b> <b>temperature</b> is 12-18C, {{with high levels of}} humidity. The needles will then begin to show signs of infection, and eventually the pathogen produces stromata, which is the pathogen's fruiting body. These are formed in the spring and early summer, and usually coincide with above average levels of rainfall. From these the blight is then passed on to the following years growth. The stromata {{can be seen as a}} clear or white mass exuding from red spots on the leaf.|$|E
40|$|Seeds of most {{cultivated}} {{varieties of}} lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) fail to germinate at warm temperatures (i. e., above 25 – 30 °C). Seed priming (controlled hydration followed by drying) alleviates this thermoinhibition {{by increasing the}} maximum <b>germination</b> <b>temperature.</b> We conducted a quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of seed germination responses to priming using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from a cross between L. sativa cv. Salinas and L. serriola accession UC 96 US 23. Priming significantly increased the maximum <b>germination</b> <b>temperature</b> of the RIL population, and a single major QTL was responsible for 47 % of the phenotypic variation due to priming. This QTL collocated with Htg 6. 1, a major QTL from UC 96 US 23 associated with high temperature germination capacity. Seeds of three near-isogenic lines (NILs) carrying an Htg 6. 1 introgression from UC 96 US 23 in a Salinas genetic background exhibited synergistic increases in maximum <b>germination</b> <b>temperature</b> in response to priming. LsNCED 4, a gene encoding a key enzyme (9 -cis-epoxycarotinoid dioxygenase) in the abscisic acid biosynthetic pathway, maps precisely with Htg 6. 1. Expression of LsNCED 4 after imbibition for 24  h at high temperature was greater in non-primed seeds of Salinas, of a second cultivar (Titan) and of NILs containing Htg 6. 1 compared to primed seeds of the same genotypes. In contrast, expression of genes encoding regulated enzymes in the gibberellin and ethylene biosynthetic pathways (LsGA 3 ox 1 and LsACS 1, respectively) was enhanced by priming and suppressed by imbibition at elevated temperatures. Developmental and temperature regulation of hormonal biosynthetic pathways is associated with seed priming effects on <b>germination</b> <b>temperature</b> sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|Phytochrome {{control of}} {{cucumber}} seed germination is temperature-dependent. A prolonged {{exposure to radiation}} from broad spectrum far red sources (Pfr/P = 0. 05 to 0. 07) prevents <b>germination</b> at <b>temperatures</b> below 20 C. Above 20 C there is no inhibition and it appears {{as if there is}} an escape from phytochrome control. However, radiation from a monochromatic, narrow band 730 nanometer source (Pfr/P < 0. 02) inhibits <b>germination</b> at <b>temperatures</b> above 20 C. This result supports the idea that, even at high temperatures, Pfr is responsible for the activation of germination. After 4 days of exposure to far red, a short red irradiation is quite effective in promoting <b>germination</b> if <b>temperatures</b> during the dark incubation periods are maintained below 20 C; red becomes effective at temperatures above 20 C. Promotion of germination will take place at a temperature of 25 C or higher without red irradiation. Again, we have an apparent escape from phytochrome control at high temperatures. However, if higher temperatures are used for only short periods, 2 to 6 hours, in combination with short red irradiation, one can demonstrate that activation of <b>germination</b> at high <b>temperatures</b> is still dependent on phytochrome. Phytochrome is probably destroyed during prolonged exposure to far red. Thus, the subsequent short red irradiation establishes levels of Pfr which may not be sufficient to promote <b>germination</b> at low <b>temperatures</b> but are probably adequate at high temperatures...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} on Viola tricolor pollen, the {{competitive}} ability of 16 pollen donors originating from a wild population was analysed {{in a set}} of greenhouse and <b>germination</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The aim was to examine the consistency in donor pollen performance across temperatures and to see whether variation in performance was random or due to individual differences in the plastic response to temperature. Pollen tube growth rate in vitro was investigated in two greenhouse temperatures (on the day pollen was collected) and in four <b>germination</b> <b>temperatures.</b> In addition, pollen tube growth rate was assessed in vivo (in one temperature) {{to examine the relationship between}} in vivo and in vitro growth. A temperature difference of 5 K - corresponding to natural variation in time and space detected in the field - affected pollen tube growth rate. For both temperature components, significant pollen donor by temperature interactions were found and rank order of pollen donors changed across treatments. Although pollen competitive ability in violets was strongly influenced by both temperature components, the occurrence of pollen donor by temperature interactions indicates that donor siring ability varies with temperature. This, in turn, may suggest a means to maintain pollen competitive ability despite selection for this trait...|$|R

40|$|High and {{low stress}} <b>temperatures</b> during seed <b>germination</b> and {{seedling}} development limit total germination {{and the rate}} of germination and growth. Changes in polyamine (PA) concentrations in seeds of different species have been associated with germination, growth and environmental stresses such as temperature, drought, oxygen, chilling injury and osmotic conditions. Two studies were conducted to determine the effect of stress <b>temperatures</b> during <b>germination</b> and seedling development on polyamine titers in soybean seeds. Three <b>germination</b> <b>temperatures,</b> 25, 30, and 36 0 C were used in the first study to evaluate their influence on changes in polyamine concentrations in soybean seeds germinated at 76 and 90 hours. The polyamines (PAs), cadaverine (Cad), putrescine (Put), spennidine (Spd), agmatine (Agm), and spermine (Spm) were quantified by HPLC using a cation exchange column and an electrochemical detector. Cad, Put, Agm, and Spd declined as the <b>germination</b> <b>temperatures</b> increased from 25 to 36 0 C. Conversely, Spm increased considerably with an increase in <b>temperature.</b> Total <b>germination</b> was reduced from 97. 2 to 92. 5 % as <b>germination</b> <b>temperatures</b> increased from 25 to 36 0 C. Germination time did not affect Cad, Agm and Spm, and total germination, however, the interaction between <b>temperature</b> and <b>germination</b> time for Put and Spd concentrations was significant. In the second study, changes in PA concentrations, seedling growth, germination time (t 50), fresh and dry weight, and moisture content were measured in the embryonic axis and cotyledons of soybean seeds germinated at 10 and 25 0 C through six stages of germination dry seed (DS), testa split (TS), radicle and 10 mm (Ra- 10), root hairs visible (RHV), secondary root primordia (SRP), and complete seedling (CS).;The concentrations of Cad and Put in the embryonic axis, were significantly higher in seeds germinated under low temperature than in seeds at 25 0 C (approximately 10 and 3 fold respectively). However, this difference was not observed until the last three stages of germination. The stage of germination also influenced the levels of these polyamines. The concentrations of Cad and Put detected at the CS stage were 50 and 18 fold respectively, relative to the initial concentrations found at the DS stage. Spd levels in seeds under stress temperatures also increased, but to a lesser extent compared to Cad and Put. Differences in Spd concentrations between temperatures were observed only at the CS stage. Agm concentrations were higher at 25 than at 10 0 C at SRP and CS. Spm concentrations of seeds germinated at 25 0 C remained higher during the first four stages of development {{but at the end of}} germination, seeds at 10 0 C had higher quantities of Spm. In the cotyledons, Polyamines tended to decline with stages of germination, regardless of the temperature. However, Agm levels increased in the cotyledons of soybean seeds. Maximum dry weight and seedling growth was found at RHV, SRP, and CS. Maximum levels of Cad and Put were also found during these stages. Spd increased with both temperatures from DS to Ra- 10, thereafter, Spd levels in seeds at 10 0 C continued increasing while seeds at 25 0 C declined.

This study tested {{the contribution of the}} dormancy gene Delay Of Germination 1 (DOG 1) to primary and secondary dormancy induction in response to environmental cues, and evaluated how DOG 1 -mediated dormancy influenced germination responses to different temperature cues. We verified that DOG 1 is involved in the induction of primary dormancy in response to cool seed-maturation temperature experienced by maternal plants, and we found that it is also involved in secondary dormancy in response to warm and prolonged cold stratification experienced by seeds during imbibition. DOG 1 -imposed dormancy can also mediate germination responses to environmental conditions, including cold stratification and <b>germination</b> <b>temperatures</b> experienced by imbibing seeds. Specifically, <b>germination</b> responsiveness to <b>temperature</b> cues is most apparent when seeds exhibit an intermediate degree of dormancy.

The effect of temperature on aspen seed germination could not be effectively described by the thermal time (TT) model, which underestimated the germination rate at 5 °C and poorly predicted the time courses of germination at 10, 20, 25 and 30 °C.

40|$|Abstract — It {{is undeniable}} {{that the global}} warming has already {{affected}} the Earth’s biota, whereby the rise of air temperature is an important factor. Agricultural systems are also affected by climate change via the interrelated bio-physical layers. Climate influences farmers ` decisions in crop management. To simulate the interactions between climate/weather and the different crop management activities an agent based modelling approach is used, in which farmers` decision making is based on crop requirements from literature. To validate these decision algorithms on how farmers arrange their daily crop management decisions like planting, fertilizing, and harvesting due to changes of climate parameters, a statistical analysis of empirical data (1970 - 2003) on temperature and different crop growth stages, which represent different management activities, was carried out.
