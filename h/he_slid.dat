5|$|Another Canadian {{admirer of}} the painted turtle is Jon Montgomery, {{who won the}} 2010 Olympic gold medal in {{skeleton}} (a form of sled) racing, while wearing a painted turtle painting on the crown of his helmet, prominently visible when <b>he</b> <b>slid</b> downhill. Montgomery, who also iconically tattoed his chest with a maple-leaf, explained his visual promotion of the turtle, {{saying that he had}} assisted one to cross the road. BC Hydro referred to Montgomery's action when describing its own sponsorship of conservation research for the turtle in British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} racing lap, Vettel led by 2.8 seconds from Webber, who was {{followed}} by Alonso, Rosberg, Hamilton, Massa, Button, Schumacher, Kubica, Hülkenberg, Sutil, Barrichello, Kobaysahi, Heidfeld, Alguersari, Liuzzi, Buemi, Glock, Petrov, Kovalainen, Yamamoto, Trulli, Senna and di Grassi. Alonso chose a cautious approach and lost four to five seconds while building up his pace slowly in the early stages. Sutil ran off the circuit but continued after losing his position to both Williams drivers. Webber lost grip on the next lap after running across the outside kerbing and spinning across the track onto the wall between turns twelve and thirteen; <b>he</b> <b>slid</b> back onto the circuit and collected Rosberg, forcing both drivers to retire. The debris on-track from the accident called the safety car to be deployed. Kobayashi, Petrov, Heidfeld and Buemi all made pit stops for intermediate tyres during the safety car period.|$|E
5|$|Dixon {{moved to}} the track's outside at the third turn on lap 216. and made heavy {{contact with the outside}} wall which <b>he</b> <b>slid</b> against. His {{right-hand}} side was heavily damaged and his right-rear wheel became detached and the final caution was prompted. Da Matta battled Papis for first place after holding it while the field was under caution. He held it for the remaining four laps to win the race. Papis finished second with Tagliani third. Junqueira took fourth and Kanaan finished in fifth. De Ferran, Andretti, Mears, Barron and Carpentier rounded out the top ten. Serviá, Vasser, Fittipadi, Gidley, Takagi and Jourdain were the last of the classified finishers. There were a record-breaking 73 lead changes in the race; 19 drivers reached the front of the field. Papis' total of 54 laps led was the highest of any competitor. Da Matta led 16 times, for a total of 53 laps. The victory was the fourth of da Matta's CART career, his second in a row, and the final of three victories he posted in the 2001 season. The attrition race was low, with 16 of the 26 starters finishing the race.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, do," [...] said Anko. And then <b>he</b> slowly <b>slid</b> {{out of the}} hole, which {{immediately}} {{closed behind}} him, leaving the coral wall as solid as before.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Corny Littlepage, here,' is {{only half}} English, and that half is colony-born and colony-bred," [...] {{answered}} the laughing girl, [...] "and he has loved a sleigh from the time when <b>he</b> first <b>slid</b> down hill--" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{leapt from}} his seat like the {{impulsive}} lad that <b>he</b> was, <b>slid</b> round to her side, and almost before she suspected it his arm was round her waist, and {{the two sets of}} curls intermingled.|$|R
5|$|As Vettel {{maintained}} his lead, the stewards informed the Lotus team that Kovalainen {{had been caught}} speeding in the pit lane, {{for which he was}} served with a ten-second stop-and-go penalty that was taken on lap thirty-nine. Alonso set a new fastest lap and closed the gap to 1.2 seconds behind Vettel at the start of lap thirty-seven. Further back, Sutil overtook Heidfeld for twelfth on the following lap. Sutil tried to pass Kobayashi on lap thirty-eight at turn three but out-braked himself, allowing Kobayashi to retake the position. He passed the Kobayashi because of his higher straight line speed, but Sutil braked later and slid off the track, rejoining in fourteenth. One lap later, Alonso was told by his team to drive less aggressively through turns seven and eight in an effort to preserve tyre life because he was spinning his tyres under acceleration. At the conclusion of lap thirty-nine, all of the drivers had made pit stops. Vettel was leading Alonso, who was followed by Hamilton, Massa, Schumacher, Barrichello, Petrov, Hülkenberg, Kubica, Liuzzi, Kobayashi, Heidfeld, Alguersari, Sutil, Button, Senna, Kovalainen and Yamamoto. A dry line began to emerge on lap forty-one as Petrov lost control of the rear-end of his car between turns seventeen and eighteen; <b>he</b> <b>slid</b> sideways into the tyre barrier at the pit lane entry.|$|E
5|$|Bird set fast laps while leading {{and kept}} the lead after his pit stop {{at the end of}} the 16th lap ahead of the yet-to-stop Binder, Ceccon and Evans. Bird was pushing when <b>he</b> <b>slid</b> after {{clipping}} the kerb on the track and glanced the barrier leaving Portier turn on lap 18. Abt was attacking Haryanto for 13th position on lap 28 and went to the outside of Haryanto by braking later than he did. The resulting manoeuvre meant Abt punted Haryanto into the inside barrier with his car's front nose being broken as a consequence. The need for the safety car was avoided as Haryanto's car was extracted from the track quickly. Abt was adjudged to have been too aggressive towards Haryanto by the stewards and was handed a drive-through penalty and was shown a black flag with an orange disc requiring him to make repairs to his car. Dillmann attempted to pass Rosenzweig but ran deep at the Novelle Chicane. He was required to hand the position back to Rosenzweig. Binder made his pit stop on the 29th lap and emerged in seventh place behind Coletti. Bird continued to lead with a seventeen-second advantage over Ceccon who was fending off the faster Evans in third position who himself had Nasr and Calado close behind him.|$|E
5|$|Fernando Alonso's luck finally ran out in Japan; {{having spent}} most of the season {{profiting}} from poor results from his rivals when he needed them the most, Alonso was the victim of a dramatic first corner clash, spinning out when he made contact with Kimi Räikkönen and paving the way for his championship rivals to make considerable inroads into his twenty-nine-point championship lead. Mark Webber was also caught up in the opening lap melee when he was hit by Romain Grosjean; Webber was forced to pit straight away, while Grosjean was given a ten-second stop-go penalty for causing yet another first lap incident. Bruno Senna also ran afoul of the stewards, hitting Nico Rosberg whilst trying to avoid Grosjean and Webber and earning a drive-through penalty for his troubles while Rosberg retired on the spot. Sergio Pérez added his name to the growing list of early retirements when <b>he</b> <b>slid</b> off at the hairpin under brakes and into the gravel trap whilst trying to force his way past a struggling Lewis Hamilton. Sebastian Vettel won the race from pole position, having led every lap of the race and setting the fastest lap time in the process to complete his second Grand Chelem. Felipe Massa finished second, his first podium result since the 2010 Korean Grand Prix, whilst Kamui Kobayashi claimed the first podium of his career – and the first podium for a Japanese driver at the Suzuka Circuit since Aguri Suzuki finished third in 1990 – after withstanding late pressure from Jenson Button.|$|E
60|$|As {{the rope}} fell across the German youth's body, he caught it tightly in both hands, and, as Dick, Tom and Sam pulled with might and main, <b>he</b> fairly <b>slid</b> on his breast {{to where they}} were standing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Get his number? I didn't {{have time}} to get anything. <b>He</b> just <b>slid</b> by, and the next thing I knew, I was turning a {{somersault}} in the air and diving right down into the bottom of that hole;" [...] and at this remark the other cadets had to smile.|$|R
50|$|Quester then focused {{again on}} European Touring Car Championship {{to drive a}} BMW 3.0 CSL for Schnitzer Motorsport. Quester had already won the 1973 Spa 24 Hours. Later racing in the DTM, <b>he</b> once <b>slid</b> {{on the roof of}} his BMW M3 over the start/finish line of the AVUS for a 3rd place.|$|R
5|$|On the 21st lap, Kyle Busch fell to {{the ninth}} position, after having no {{assistance}}. Two laps later, Bowyer took the first position, but after two more laps, he was passed by Gordon. At lap 27, Truex, with assistance from Hamlin became the leader for only a lap before Edwards reclaimed the position. Afterward on lap 30, Burton became the leader ahead Biffle and Gordon. Seven laps later, Gordon, with assistance from Bayne became moved into {{the first and second}} positions. On the 39th lap, Brad Keselowski spun sideways after losing control of his car, prompting the third caution to come out. <b>He</b> <b>slid</b> through grass but continued without any apparent damage. At the lap 43 restart, Gordon remained in the first position, but on the following lap, Edwards retook the lead. On the 46th lap, Hamlin spun sideways to cause the fourth caution. Edwards remained the leader at the lap 49 restart. Five laps later, the fifth caution was given, after Todd Bodine crashed. With three laps remaining in the race, Burton and Bowyer were in the first two positions. Burton remained the leader to cross the finish line in first, ahead of Bowyer in second. Also on the final lap, there was an accident at behind the front runners. Michael Waltrip finished third, Kyle Busch clinched fourth, and Brian Keselowski rounded out the first five positions.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees {{opened the}} scoring {{in the first}} inning with two runs, but the Phillies {{answered}} with back-to-back doubles by Shane Victorino and Chase Utley {{in the bottom of the}} inning. The Phillies tied the game in the bottom of the fourth as Ryan Howard singled, stole second, and scored on a single by Pedro Feliz. Replays showed that Howard did not touch home plate as <b>he</b> <b>slid</b> across; however, the Yankees did not appeal. Swisher led off the fifth inning with a walk, scoring on a single by Derek Jeter, and Melky Cabrera scored on a single by Damon. Park relieved Blanton in the seventh and held the Yankees scoreless. Chase Utley hit his third home run of the series in the bottom of the seventh with two outs. Dámaso Marte struck out Howard to end the inning. After a game-tying home run by Feliz, Lidge entered the game in the ninth and gave up a two-out single to Damon. With Teixeira batting, Damon stole second and advanced to third as the base was uncovered due to the pull shift against Teixeira. Rodriguez put the Yankees ahead with a double to left field, scoring Damon. Posada added to that lead with a single which scored Teixeira, who had singled, and Rodriguez. Mariano Rivera entered in the bottom of the ninth and notched his second save of the series.|$|E
5|$|The fifth caution {{was shown}} on lap 188 when Moreno's engine failed {{on the top}} of the fourth turn and stopped at the exit of pit road to retire. Some drivers made pit stops for fuel under caution which would allow them to finish the race by using a rich fuel mixture which {{increased}} their top speeds. Racing resumed at the start of lap 196. Fernández veered right under acceleration on the same lap into the turn three entrance wall which removed his right-front wing section and his wheel. <b>He</b> <b>slid</b> across the track and stopped at the turn three infield apron, and the sixth caution was displayed. Consequently, Kneifel removed a further ten laps from the race's overall distance. The race restarted on lap 202 with Serviá battling Junqueira at the start-finish line for the lead. Serviá passed Junqueira shortly afterward and da Matta moved into second position. Tagliani overtook Serviá for second place on lap 204, while Papis passed Junqueira for fourth three laps later. De Ferran lost third after he was passed by Papis on the 209th lap; his engine went soft and sustained a punctured left-rear tire which increased understeer. On lap 213, Papis went underneath da Matta to move back into the lead, before da Matta recaimed the position on the following lap.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> gently <b>slid</b> {{his hand}} toward hers and slipped his fingers softly around it. She made a slight {{movement}} of withdrawal, but even then--as if in forgetfulness or indifference--permitted {{her hand to}} rest unresponsively in his. It was scarcely an encouragement to gallantry, neither was it a rejection of an unconscious familiarity.|$|R
50|$|Ben {{believes}} <b>he</b> has <b>slid</b> into {{an alternate}} universe when Gloria disappears and Deirdre takes her place. Ben has the vague impression {{he may have}} shot and killed Gloria. Spin and Phil, young thugs who collect protection money from Ben, clash with Deirdre, who takes a more and more authoritative role in the house.|$|R
60|$|It was Jeeves. <b>He</b> had <b>slid</b> {{from the}} shadows and was gazing gravely at the picture. Upon my word, I can't give you {{a better idea of}} the {{shattering}} effect of Corky's uncle Alexander when in action than by saying that he had absolutely made me forget for the moment that Jeeves was there.|$|R
5|$|Sebastian Vettel's {{momentum}} continued {{one week}} later in Korea, winning his third consecutive race and taking a six-point championship lead as Fernando Alonso finished third. Vettel overcame pole-sitter Mark Webber at the start, and was aided in building up a lead by first-lap contact between Jenson Button, Nico Rosberg and Kamui Kobayashi that saw Button and Rosberg retire with damage from the collision; Rosberg pulled over on the approach to the third turn, forcing a protracted yellow flag period as marshalls attempted to retrieve his car. With the sporting regulations banning overtaking while yellow flags were shown, the field was effectively thinned out in the opening laps as drivers were unable to pass one another. Tyre management {{became the focus of}} the race, as drivers reported heavy graining, particularly on the right-front tyre, which bore most of the load over a lap of the circuit. Vettel ignored six radio calls from his pit wall cautioning him that a tyre failure was imminent, only backing off just enough in the final few laps to secure victory over Webber by six seconds. The team later denied that there had ever been a problem with Vettel's tyres. Further down the order, Scuderia Toro Rosso's Jean-Éric Vergne and Daniel Ricciardo fought their way from sixteenth and twenty-first on the grid to finish eighth and ninth, while Romain Grosjean drove a conservative race to finish seventh, having been warned beforehand by the stewards that another first-lap altercation would likely result in his disqualification from the race. Lewis Hamilton's day went from bad to worse when an anti-roll bar on his McLaren failed, while the car handled its tyres so poorly that he was forced to make an unscheduled stop {{in order to make it}} to the finish, only to tear up a length of astroturf that wreaked havoc on his downforce and <b>he</b> <b>slid</b> down to tenth place, narrowly fending off an opportunistic charge from Sergio Pérez to take the final World Championship point on offer. Button's retirement and Hamilton's single point meant that McLaren lost second place in the World Constructors' Championship to Ferrari, and Hamilton admitted that his bid to be the 2012 World Drivers' Champion was over.|$|E
25|$|He {{was voted}} WPBSA Newcomer of the Year and WSA Young Player of the Year in 1999. Tipped by many pundits as a {{potential}} champion of the game, Fu's subsequent performance was disappointing, and <b>he</b> <b>slid</b> back down the rankings.|$|E
25|$|On May 7, 2017, John Thorton Jenkins, a 32-year-old {{experienced}} climber from Seattle, WA {{was heading}} for the summit when <b>he</b> <b>slid</b> down steep terrain near the Hogsback. He sustained serious injuries and was treated by search and rescue teams, who had him flown to a Portland hospital, but he was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait a moment," [...] said Dalton. [...] "Perhaps it wasn't pox, {{perhaps it}} was only mountain-fever. Cavanagh {{is not the kind}} of man to involve others in a pestilence. I reckon he knew it was nothing but a fever, and, not wishing to alarm his friends, <b>he</b> just <b>slid</b> into town and out again." ...|$|R
60|$|And now as Luke de Mountford {{held her}} hands, {{and she stood}} close beside him, her breath coming and going in quick gasps, with the {{suppressed}} excitement of latent self-sacrifice, her eyes glowing and tearless, <b>he</b> half <b>slid</b> from the chair on which he was sitting, and one knee was on the ground, and his face turned up to hers.|$|R
60|$|With {{a sigh of}} relief, {{but with}} {{unabated}} caution, <b>he</b> gently <b>slid</b> the trapdoor to one side far enough to permit him to raise his eyes above {{the level of the}} roof. A quick glance assured him that there was none near enough to observe his movements, nor, in fact, {{as far as he could}} see, was anyone in sight.|$|R
25|$|In January 1950, Landrith {{signed a}} new deal with the Cincinnati Reds. On March 10, he was {{assigned}} to the Tulsa Oilers of the Class AA Texas League. In the opening game for Tulsa against the Dallas Eagles on April 11 at the Cotton Bowl, Landrith went 1 for 2 with a double before breaking his left ankle as <b>he</b> <b>slid</b> into home plate.|$|E
25|$|On 6 November 2004, it was {{announced}} that Häkkinen would make his debut in the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters (DTM) series for the HWA Team in the 2005 season. He was partnered by Gary Paffett, Jean Alesi and Bernd Schneider. Häkkinen had previous experience of driving touring cars in July 2001 at the Brno Circuit alongside Schneider. In January, Häkkinen once again participated in the Arctic Rally driving a Toyota Corolla with co-driver Risto Pietiläinen. Häkkinen retired when <b>he</b> <b>slid</b> off the road on the eleventh stage.|$|E
25|$|Demeter was {{the opening}} day starter in center field on April 12, 1965 at the Kansas City Athletics. Demeter {{was hit by a}} pitch from Athletics pitcher Moe Drabowsky in the first inning, but he {{finished}} the game on 3-for-3 with a triple and two runs scored. Although it was intended for Demeter to remain in the outfield, Demeter was asked to again take his duties to the infield at first base. In May, he sat out several games after suffering a minor case of whiplash in the neck and shoulder after <b>he</b> <b>slid</b> head-first into third base.|$|E
60|$|Putting a noose {{which was}} {{at one end of}} the rope over the stump of one of the bars, <b>he</b> at once <b>slid</b> down. A moment later, the other man descended after him.|$|R
6000|$|... "At least I {{will look}} at the thing again," [...] <b>he</b> said, and <b>slid</b> down a creeper to the earth; but Bagheera was before him. Mowgli could hear him {{snuffing}} in the half light.|$|R
6000|$|... "We walked {{every step}} of the way, and was lucky to get down at that," [...] responded Dale, gravely. [...] "No horse should have been ridden down there. Why, <b>he</b> must have <b>slid</b> down." ...|$|R
25|$|Marquis had an up-and-down {{season in}} 2005. Although {{he started the}} season strong, <b>he</b> <b>slid</b> into a {{personal}} 7-game losing streak. It ended on August 27, 2005, when Marquis pitched a 2-hitter against the Washington Nationals, for his first career shutout. Overall Marquis posted a 13–14 record, with a 4.13 ERA in 207 innings pitched. He appeared in 33games, starting 32, and completing 3 (6th in the NL). He gave up the second-lowest percentage of line drives in the NL (17.3%), induced 29 double plays (T-4th in the league), and was 4th with 1.26 GIDP/9 IP.|$|E
25|$|After {{waging a}} {{tremendous}} qualifying battle with Schumacher on Saturday and securing a front-row starting position, Häkkinen dug himself a hole {{on a cool}} but sunny race day: first, <b>he</b> <b>slid</b> off the track into the guardrail {{at the end of}} the infield straight in the morning warm-up, damaging his McLaren's suspension and requiring a heroic job by his crew to get the car ready to race. Three hours later, he learned that his failure to wait for the green light to begin the warm-up session had caused his best qualifying lap to be taken away, dropping him from second to fourth position on the grid.|$|E
25|$|Remarkably for an {{unsuccessful}} car, in his only ever race, Marcus Winkelhock started last at the European Grand Prix at the Nürburgring but after getting his tactics {{right at the}} start of the wet race (by changing tyres after the warm up lap), Winkelhock found himself leading the race with a 33-second lead after just two laps due to most of the field either pitting for wet tyres or spinning off. The race was stopped due to the dangerous conditions. Winkelhock officially led the race for 7 laps but as the conditions improved following the restart, <b>he</b> <b>slid</b> down the field in his uncompetitive car and eventually retired after 15 laps.|$|E
6000|$|They {{would all}} no doubt have {{been eager to}} hear Bert's story over again, but it was it this point that Laurier showed his quality. [...] "No, SIR," [...] <b>he</b> said, and <b>slid</b> from off his table.|$|R
6000|$|And {{certainly}} Sam did [...] "leg it" [...] as {{he never}} had before. Straight for the home plate <b>he</b> came, and <b>slid</b> in amid a cloud of dust, just before the ball came up from the field.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Lawrence, [...] "I'm frankly puzzled; {{the more}} I {{think about our}} adventure, {{the harder it is}} to decide how much one could hold Walters {{accountable}} for. It was difficult to throw me up the rope without slipping, and there was only a small, projecting rock, on which he might have broken his bones, to prevent his tobogganing to the bottom. If <b>he</b> had <b>slid</b> past it, <b>he</b> would have been killed." ...|$|R
