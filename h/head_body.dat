5|$|Adults {{have a full}} moult after breeding, {{beginning}} between late May {{and the end of}} June, {{and completed}} by early October. Juvenile birds have a partial moult, replacing their <b>head,</b> <b>body,</b> and covert feathers; this is completed by October, although the start of the moult depends on when the chicks hatched.|$|E
5|$|After breeding, {{adults have}} a {{complete}} moult which takes at least eight weeks; males acquire more yellow in the plumage each time they moult. Juveniles have a partial moult not long after fledging, replacing the <b>head,</b> <b>body</b> and some covert feathers.|$|E
5|$|Juveniles moult their <b>head,</b> <b>body</b> {{and some}} wing {{feathers}} {{a few weeks}} after fledging, and adults have a complete moult after breeding. In both cases, if the process is not complete by the time of migration it is suspended and completed on the wintering grounds.|$|E

5|$|Decapitation was the {{preferred}} method in German and western Slavic areas, {{with the head}} buried between the feet, behind the buttocks or away from the body. This act {{was seen as a}} way of hastening the departure of the soul, which in some cultures, was said to linger in the corpse. The vampire's <b>head,</b> <b>body,</b> or clothes could also be spiked and pinned to the earth to prevent rising.|$|E
5|$|The scaly {{juvenile}} plumage is retained until January or February of {{the year}} following hatching, when a lengthy moult of head and body feathers gives them a more adult-like appearance. Adults shed all their flight feathers simultaneously around this time, leaving them temporarily flightless, prior to gaining breeding plumage, but second-year birds delay this substantial moult until the summer. The adult winter plumage is attained between October and January by partial moult mainly of <b>head,</b> <b>body</b> and tail feathers.|$|E
5|$|The {{water pipit}} has a {{complete}} moult between July and September, {{although there is}} considerable individual variation in timing. There is a partial pre-breeding moult, mainly between January and March, but with much variability in timing. This moult typically involves replacing the <b>head,</b> <b>body</b> and some wing feathers, but the extent is again variable. Very occasionally, females may moult into what looks like non-breeding plumage, rather than the expected brighter garb. The chicks start to gain juvenile plumage {{as soon as a}} month after hatching, and most have completed the transition to near-adult appearance by September. The first pre-breeding moult {{is similar to that of}} the adult, but may be less complete or even absent.|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{population}} genetics of the louse infestations of humans. We used microsatellite DNA to study 11 double infestations, that is, hosts infested with <b>head</b> lice and <b>body</b> lice simultaneously. We tested for population structure on a host, and for population structure among seven hosts that shared sleeping quarters. We also sought evidence of migration among louse populations. Our results showed that: (i) the <b>head</b> and <b>body</b> lice on these individual hosts were two genetically distinct populations; (ii) each host had their own populations of <b>head</b> and <b>body</b> lice that were genetically distinct to those on other hosts; and (iii) lice had migrated from head to <b>head,</b> and from <b>body</b> to body, but not between <b>heads</b> and <b>bodies.</b> Our results indicate that <b>head</b> and <b>body</b> lice are separate species.

40|$|The {{specific}} {{status of}} the <b>head</b> and <b>body</b> lice of humans has been debated for more than 200 yr. To clarify the specific status of <b>head</b> and <b>body</b> lice, we sequenced 524 base pairs (bp) of the cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene of 28 <b>head</b> and 28 <b>body</b> lice from nine countries. Ten haplotypes that differed by 1 - 5 bp at II nucleotide positions were identified. A phylogeny of these sequences indicates that these <b>head</b> and <b>body</b> lice are not from reciprocally monophyletic lineages. Indeed, <b>head</b> and <b>body</b> lice share three of the 10 haplotypes we found. F-ST values and exact tests of haplotype frequencies showed significant differences between <b>head</b> and <b>body</b> lice. However, the same tests also showed significant differences among lice from different countries. Indeed, more {{of the variation in}} haplotype frequencies was explained by differences among lice from different countries than by differences between <b>head</b> and <b>body</b> lice. Our results indicate the following: (1) bead and body lice do not represent reciprocally monophyletic lineages and are conspecific; (2) gene flow among populations of lice from different countries is limited; and (3) frequencies of COI haplotypes can be used to study maternal gene flow among populations of <b>head</b> and <b>body</b> lice and thus transmission of lice among their human hosts...|$|R

5|$|Mainly nocturnal, {{the female}} redback {{lives in an}} untidy web in a warm {{sheltered}} location, commonly near or inside human residences. It preys on insects, spiders and small vertebrates that become ensnared in its web. It kills its prey by injecting a complex venom through its two fangs when it bites, before wrapping them in silk and sucking out the liquefied insides. Often, It first squirts its victim with what resembles 'superglue' from its spinnerets, immobilising the prey by sticking the victim's limbs and appendages to its own body. The Redback Spider then trusses the victim with silk. Once its prey is restrained, it is bitten repeatedly on the <b>head,</b> <b>body</b> and leg segments and is then hauled back to the Redback Spider's retreat. Sometimes a potentially dangerous victim can be left to struggle for hours until it is exhausted enough to approach safely. Male spiders and spiderlings often live {{on the periphery of}} the female spiders' web and steal leftovers. Other species of spider and parasitoid wasps prey on this species. The redback is one of few arachnids that usually display sexual cannibalism while mating.|$|E
5|$|Redbacks usually prey on insects, but {{can capture}} larger animals that become {{entangled}} in the web, including trapdoor spiders, small lizards, and even on rare occasion snakes. One web was recorded as containing a dead mouse. The woodlouse (Porcellio scaber) is a particularly common food item. Developing spiderlings need size-appropriate prey, and laboratory studies {{show that they are}} willing to consume common fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), mealworm larvae (Tenebrio molitor), muscoid flies and early nymphs of cockroaches. Food scraps and lighting attract insect prey to areas of human activity, which brings the redbacks. Once alerted to a creature becoming ensnared in a trap line, the redback advances to around a leg's length from its target, touching it and squirting a liquid glutinous silk over it to immobilise it. It then bites its victim repeatedly on the <b>head,</b> <b>body</b> and leg joints and wraps it in sticky and dry silk. Unlike other spiders, it does not rotate its prey while wrapping in silk, but like other spiders, it then injects a venom that liquefies its victim's innards. Once it has trussed the prey, the redback takes it to its retreat and begins sucking out the liquefied insides, generally 5 to 20 minutes after first attacking it. Redback spiders do not usually drink, except when starved.|$|E

25|$|Researchers use {{a mixture}} of highly {{purified}} enzymes (Collagenase) to isolate islets from the pancreas of a deceased donor.

500|$|The {{pectoral}} fins {{are rather}} long and broad. The first dorsal fin originates over {{the rear of}} the pelvic fin bases; the second dorsal fin is slightly larger and originates over {{the rear of the}} anal fin base. The pelvic and anal fins are long and low, and larger than the dorsal fins. The free rear tips of the pelvic fins may be fused together to some degree, but never completely; males have slender, pointed claspers. The caudal peduncle is long and thin, particularly in younger sharks. The caudal fin makes up one-fourth to one-fifth of the total length and has a weak lower lobe and a ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The thick skin is covered by well-calcified dermal denticles, except around the gill slits. Enlarged, spike-like denticles are found on the upper surface of the pectoral fins and along the dorsal midline from the snout to the second dorsal fin origin. Juvenile Izak catsharks are boldly patterned with many irregularly shaped dark brown spots on a light yellow to yellowish brown background. The spots enlarge and fuse with age to form an intricate pattern of reticulations and U-shaped markings in adults.

40|$|Human <b>head</b> and <b>body</b> lice are {{obligatory}} hematophagous ectoparasites {{that belong}} to a single species Pediculus humanus. Only body lice, however, are vectors of the infections gram-negative bacteria Bartonella quintana. Due to their near identical genomes, yet differential vector competency, <b>head</b> and <b>body</b> lice provide an ideal model system to study an insects ability to gain or lose vector competency. Using our in vitro louse rearing system, we have infected both <b>head</b> and <b>body</b> lice with a blood containing B. quintana in order to detect differences in B. quintana proliferation between <b>head</b> and <b>body</b> lice as well as transcriptional regulation of immune-related genes. B. quintana proliferates rapidly in body lice after 6 days post-infection, but declines in head lice after 4 days post-infection, possibly explaining, in part, the differential vector competence between the two insects. A transcriptome analysis using whole lice followed by qPCR verification of <b>head</b> and <b>body</b> lice immune-related genes was then conducted using uninfected, versus B. quintana infected lice to identify potential genes involved in vector competence. The immune-related genes Defensin 1, Fibrinogen-related protein and Spaetzle, were differentially regulated between <b>head</b> and <b>body</b> lice and were identified as potential targets for future research. Previously studied immune-related genes, PGRP, Defensin 1 and Defensin 2 transcription levels were also assessed in body louse midgut using qPCR following B. quintana infection. In this case, B. quintana infection {{did not result in}} significant effects on the transcript levels of these genes in midgut tissue. Overall transcriptional profiles of <b>head</b> and <b>body</b> lice genomes were notably different, including difference in the expression of 18. 3 % of immune related genes, a finding that strongly supports the contention that immune system differences between <b>head</b> and <b>body</b> lice are the primary reason for difference in vector capacity...|$|R

500|$|The corn crake is a {{medium-sized}} rail, [...] long with a wingspan of [...] Males weigh [...] on average and females [...] The adult male has {{the crown of}} its head {{and all of its}} upperparts brown-black in colour, streaked with buff or grey. The wing coverts are a distinctive chestnut colour with some white bars. The face, neck and breast are blue-grey, apart from a pale brown streak {{from the base of the}} bill to behind the eye, the belly is white, and the flanks, and undertail are barred with chestnut and white. The strong bill is flesh-coloured, the iris is pale brown, and the legs and feet are pale grey. Compared to the male, the female has warmer-toned upperparts and a narrower duller eye streak. Outside the breeding season, the upperparts of both sexes become darker and the underparts less grey. The juvenile is like the adult in appearance, but has a yellow tone to its upperparts, and the grey of the underparts is replaced with buff-brown. The chicks have black down, as with all rails. While there are no subspecies, all populations show great individual variation in colouring, and the birds gradually become paler and greyer towards the east of the range. Adults undergo a complete moult after breeding, which is normally finished by late August or early September, before migration to south eastern Africa. There is a pre-breeding partial moult prior to the return from Africa, mainly involving the plumage of the <b>head,</b> <b>body</b> and tail. Young birds have a head and body moult about five weeks after hatching.|$|E
2500|$|Joseph Jordania {{from the}} University of Melbourne {{recently}} (2011) suggested that bipedalism {{was one of}} the central elements of the general defense strategy of early hominids, based on aposematism, or warning display and intimidation of potential predators and competitors with exaggerated visual and audio signals. According to this model, hominids were trying to stay as visible and as loud as possible all the time. Several morphological and behavioral developments were employed to achieve this goal: [...] upright bipedal posture, longer legs, long tightly coiled hair {{on the top of the}} <b>head,</b> <b>body</b> painting, threatening synchronous body movements, loud voice and extremely loud rhythmic singing/stomping/drumming on external subjects. Slow locomotion and strong body odor (both characteristic for hominids and humans) are other features often employed by aposematic species to advertise their non-profitability for potential predators.|$|E

The eggs are laid in early morning at daily {{intervals}} until the clutch is complete. The clutch is typically 4–5 eggs which are smooth and slightly glossy but very variable in colour. They range from pale-blueish green to light red with purple brown blotches, spots or steaks. The average size of an egg is [...] with a weight of [...] The eggs are incubated for 10–16 days by the female. The chicks are altricial, hatching nearly naked with closed eyes, and are fed by both parents but mainly by the female who broods them for around six days. They are mainly fed caterpillars. The nestlings fledge 11–18 days after hatching and disperse. The young birds are then assisted with feeding by both parents for a further three weeks. The parents only very rarely start a second brood, but when they do so it is always in a new nest. Juveniles undergo a partial moult at around five weeks of age in which they replace their <b>head,</b> <b>body</b> and many of their covert feathers but not their primary and secondary flight feathers. After breeding adult birds undergo a complete annual moult which lasts around ten weeks.|$|E
