5|$|Earlier than Stifel, the 8th century Jain {{mathematician}} Virasena {{is credited}} with a precursor to the binary logarithm. Virasena's concept of ardhacheda <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>defined</b> {{as the number of}} times a given number can be divided evenly by two. This definition gives rise to a function that coincides with the binary logarithm on the powers of two, but it is different for other integers, giving the 2-adic order rather than the logarithm.|$|E
5|$|Its {{position}} was formed through constitutional convention, making {{its status as}} de facto capital {{a part of the}} UK's unwritten constitution. The capital of England was moved to London from Winchester as the Palace of Westminster developed in the 12th and 13th centuries to become the permanent location of the royal court, and thus the political capital of the nation. More recently, Greater London <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>defined</b> as a region of England and in this context is known as London.|$|E
5|$|The New South Wales Parks and Wildlife Service {{has divided}} New South Wales into 17 {{distinct}} bioregions. Bioregions are quite {{large areas of}} land that capture a geophysical pattern which is linked to fauna and flora ecosystems. The Riverina bioregion {{is an area of}} land that comprises part of the larger Riverina area but also extends into Victoria. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>defined</b> by the New South Wales Parks and Wildlife Service as extending from Ivanhoe in the Murray Darling Depression Bioregion south to Bendigo, and from Narrandera in the east to Balranald in the west. 74.03% of the bioregion is in New South Wales, the remainder in Victoria.|$|E

5|$|According to the Parliamentary paper Misc. 5 of 1966, the {{background}} of the ensign is red with the ratio of its width to its length being one by two. In contrast, the ratio of the national flag of Singapore is two by three. In the centre of the ensign is a white ring, which surrounds a crescent and five stars also coloured white. The five stars are arranged such that they form a pentagon in the middle. The crescent and stars are taken from the national flag, although in the ensign the crescent appears underneath rather than {{to the left of the}} stars. According to a 1999 circular National Colours for Singapore Ships issued by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), the red colour of the civil ensign is the same as that of the national flag. The shade of red <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>defined</b> by the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts as Pantone 032.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} {{has been}} more broadly described {{as the ability to}} adjust one’s thinking from old situations to new situations as well as the ability to overcome responses or thinking that have become habitual and adapt to new situations. As such, if one is able to overcome previously held beliefs or habits (when it is required for new situations) then they would be considered cognitively flexible. Lastly, the ability to simultaneously consider two aspects of an object, idea, or situation at one point in time refers to cognitive flexibility. According to this definition, when sorting cards based on specific rules, children are considered cognitively flexible if they can sort cards based on the color of the objects and type of objects on the card simultaneously. Similarly, cognitive flexibility <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>defined</b> as having the understanding and awareness of all possible options and alternatives simultaneously within any given situation.|$|E
5|$|In {{political}} and sociocultural studies, monarchies are normally associated with hereditary rule; most monarchs, in both {{historical and contemporary}} contexts, have been born and raised within a royal family. Succession <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>defined</b> {{using a variety of}} distinct formulae, such as proximity of blood, primogeniture, and agnatic seniority. Some monarchies, however, are not hereditary, and the ruler is instead determined through an elective process; a modern example is the throne of Malaysia. These systems defy the model concept of a monarchy, but are commonly considered as such because they retain certain associative characteristics. Many systems use a combination of hereditary and elective elements, where the election or nomination of a successor is restricted to members of a royal bloodline.|$|E

5|$|There is no {{consensus}} about how to classify the severity of psoriasis. Mild psoriasis <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>defined</b> {{as a percentage of}} body surface area (BSA)≤10, a Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) score ≤10, and a dermatology life quality index (DLQI) score ≤10. Moderate to severe psoriasis was defined by the same group as BSA >10 or PASI score >10 and a DLQI score >10. The DLQI is a 10 question tool used to measure the impact of several dermatologic diseases on daily functioning. The DLQI score ranges from 0 (minimal impairment) to 30 (maximal impairment) and is calculated with each answer being assigned 0–3 points with higher scores indicating greater social or occupational impairment.|$|E
5|$|General {{aviation}} in the United Kingdom <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>defined</b> as a {{civil aircraft}} operation other than a commercial air transport flight operating to a schedule or military aviation. Although the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) excludes any form of remunerated aviation from its definition, some commercial operations are often included {{within the scope of}} general aviation (GA) in the UK. The sector operates business jets, rotorcraft, piston and jet-engined fixed-wing aircraft, gliders of all descriptions, and lighter than air craft. Public transport operations include business (or corporate) aviation and air taxi services, and account for nearly half of the economic contribution made by the sector. Other commercial GA activities are aerial work, such as surveying and air ambulances, and flight training, which {{plays an important role in}} the supply of pilots to the commercial air transport (CAT) industry. Private flying is conducted for personal transport and recreation. It includes a strong vintage aircraft movement, and encompasses a range of air sports, such as racing, aerobatics, and parachuting, at which British teams and individuals have succeeded in international competition.|$|E
