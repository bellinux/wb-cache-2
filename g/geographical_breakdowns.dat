40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Integrated Household Survey (IHS), which ran from 2009 - 2014, was a composite survey combining questions asked {{on a number of}} social surveys conducted by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to produce a dataset of 'core' variables. The ONS stopped producing IHS datasets from 2015 onwards; variables covering health, smoking prevalence, forces veterans, sexual identity and well-being will be incorporated into the Annual Population Survey - see the Which surveys (or modules) are included in the IHS? and What is the IHS? FAQ pages for further details. Background and history of the IHS The aim of the IHS was to produce high-level estimates for particular themes to a higher precision and lower geographic level than current ONS social surveys. The 'core' set contains around 100 questions, but a respondent was only asked a proportion of those depending on routing from answers to questions. The core questions were asked, where possible, {{at the beginning of the}} component surveys. IHS prior to 2009 : A set of core questions were introduced within three surveys in January 2008; the General Lifestyle Survey, Living Costs and Food Survey, and the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey. In April 2008 the IHS core questions were introduced on the English Housing Survey, bringing the family of modules on the IHS up to four. The IHS data for 2008 - 2009 was used as a pilot for the concept, developing the systems and designing the weighting methodology. The IHS data for that period have not been published as they do not provide better quality information than that within existing surveys. Hence, the earliest IHS data currently available from the UK Data Archive cover 2009 - 2010. IHS from 2009 - 2010 : In April 2009 the IHS core questions were introduced on the Labour Force Survey (LFS) and Annual Population Survey (APS) questionnaires, though not all the core IHS questions were fully harmonised on the LFS. From June 2009 the Life Opportunities Survey (LOS, subsequently closed in 2014) was included in the IHS family of modules. With the inclusion of these new surveys the IHS became complete, with an achieved annual sample size of approximately 450, 000 individuals from interviews undertaken in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Therefore, the first IHS dataset to be released covers the period April 2009 - March 2010, starting the IHS data series from the point that all surveys were included. The large sample size and UK-wide coverage means various <b>geographical</b> <b>breakdowns</b> are possible in the IHS, and it is possible to use a geographical hierarchy to drill down to lower level detail within an area. (The lowest geographic level available on the standard access End User Licence IHS dataset is Government Office Region (GOR). Users who require more detailed geographies will need to make an application to use the Special Licence version of the IHS (see below)). From April 2009 - March 2010, the IHS contained data collected from the following surveys: General Lifestyle Survey; Living Costs and Food Survey; Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (removed January 2010); English Housing Survey (removed April 2011); Labour Force Survey; Annual Population Survey; and Life Opportunities Survey (removed April 2011). Available IHS data: End User Licence and Special Licence IHS Users should note that there are two versions of each IHS study. One is available under the standard End User Licence (EUL) agreement, and the other is a Special Licence (SL) version. The SL version contains more detailed variables relating to age, age of youngest dependent child, country of birth, family unit type, household and household reference person, industry class, sub-class and division, month left last job, cohabitation, country of residence history, multiple households at address, nationality, New Deal training types, National Statistics Socio-Economic Classification (NS-SEC) long version, qualifications, household relationships, minor Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) groups, sexual identity, training and working age. The more detailed geographic variables present include county, unitary/local authority, Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics 2 (NUTS 2) and NUTS 3 regions and Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs). Users should note that the user guide also mentions variables that are not included in either the EUL or SL datasets held at the Archive. The EUL version contains less detailed variables. For example, the lowest geography available is Government Office Region, only major (3 -digit) SOC groups are included for main, second and last job, and only industry sector for main, second and last job. Users are advised to first obtain the standard EUL version of the data to see if they are sufficient for their research requirements. The SL data have more restrictive access conditions than those made available under the standard EUL. Prospective users of the SL version will need to complete an extra application form and demonstrate to the data owners exactly why they need access to the additional variables in order to get permission to use that version. Therefore, users are strongly advised to order the standard version of the data. In order to help users choose the correct dataset, 'Special Licence Access' has been added to the dataset titles for the SL versions of the data. The SL version of the IHS April 2009 - March 2010 is available under SN 6585. For the second edition (April 2011), updated versions of the data file and User Guide documentation were deposited, due to changes in the weighting methodology. See documentation file 'ihs_information_a 09 j_and_j 09 j. pdf' for full details. Main Topics : The IHS core questions cover several themes. These include: economic activity education health and disability identity income Income variables : Users should note that while income data are collected within the IHS and questions are included in the questionnaire, ONS have so far not been able to harmonise the income variables across the different surveys that comprise the IHS. Therefore, there are currently no income variables included in the EUL or SL datasets deposited at the Archive; the variables are only included in the Government Statistical Services (GSS) client and ONS internal research datasets. For further details, see the IHS user guide. <br...|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates a {{specific}} aspect of international production linkages that, following Hummels et al. (2001), is commonly designated as vertical specialization (VS) - {{the use of}} imported inputs to produce goods that are afterwards exported. We propose a relative measure of VS-based trade that combines information from Input-Output matrices and international trade data, producing results for a large sample of individual countries and geographical areas with a detailed product breakdown over the 1967 - 2005 period. This measure identifies a country’s trade flow as associated with VS activities when the share of exports of a good relatively to the world average is above a given threshold and it {{is accompanied by a}} relative share of imports of a related intermediate product that is also above the threshold. The quantification of VS-based trade for each country/product pair in each period is made in a relative and conservative manner, since it includes only the value of intermediate imports that surpasses what is implied by the chosen international threshold. The detailed results can be subsequently added up to get any product or <b>geographical</b> <b>breakdown</b> desired. We illustrate this measure by showing the evolution of VS activities at the world level over the last four decades using a product breakdown by technological intensity and a <b>geographical</b> <b>breakdown</b> by main areas. The results point to a substantial increase of VS in high-technology products over the last two decades. There is also empirical evidence on the sharp increase of VS activities in East Asia. ...|$|R

Reactions are different across types of consumers: while homeowners increase consumption when house prices increase, with a marginal propensity of about 0. 035, the rentersÂ’ response to the higher house cost tends to be that of increased savings.

40|$|Global equity {{management}} {{has historically been}} structured primarily around country asset allocation. This approach {{was supported by the}} usual observation that the country factor is the major source of influence on stock price behavior and that the correlation between equity and currency is close to zero and unstable, so country exposure matches currency exposure. This logic breaks down in a world where companies work and compete on a global basis and are recognized as such by investors in their pricing of securities. As corporations expand and diversify their international activities, the relative importance of domestic factors for such corporations should decline. If a corporation is regarded as a portfolio of international activities, its stock price should be influenced by international factors in relation to the <b>geographical</b> <b>breakdown</b> of its activities. Similarly, the currency exposure should be influenced by the geographical distribution of the firm's activities, rather than by the domicile of incorporation or by the location where the stock is mainly traded. Under integrated or “global pricing” the marketplace would reflect the value and changes to value of the foreign activities of the firm. In essence a French firm with foreign activities could expect investors to value each stream of “national” earnings at the relevant “national ” discount rate adjusted for the firm's specific risk characteristics...|$|R
30|$|This {{model of}} {{oligopsony}} with heterogeneous worker preferences {{is based on}} Salop (1979), who enriches the Hotelling (1929)’s model with a circle city. This model of oligopsony with heterogeneous worker preferences {{is based on a}} combination of both concepts. In the presence of taste-based discrimination, it yields an enduring wage gap between the majority and the minority without worker segregation. Consequently, this model does not exactly reproduce <b>geographical</b> <b>breakdown</b> by ethnicity and fits better gender than race discrimination. The main contributions of this paper are, first, that discrimination does not come from a productivity gap, real or assumed, between minority and majority group workers. Second, a single prejudiced firm is sufficient to induce a significant wage gap in the market. Further, non-prejudiced firms discriminate against the minority without having any taste for discrimination or beliefs regarding them. Furthermore, firms make more profits when they are located in an area close to similar firms. If higher competition decreases the wage gap, it totally vanishes if and only if commuting costs disappear or if the number of firms tends to infinity. Moreover, unprejudiced firms have no incentive to compete with prejudiced firms to drive the latter out, as they profit from the existence of discrimination. Consequently, discrimination can persist even in the long term. As discrimination will not disappear via competition, governments consequently have to introduce public policies. In this paper, these consist of equal wage laws, employment subsidies, introduction of a minimum wage, affirmative action, and transport improvements and subsidies.|$|R
40|$|This thesis principally {{studies the}} {{determination}} of UK export performance between the wars. Several improvements to the measurement of sterling's nominal and {{real effective exchange rate}} in the period are implemented, and the path of the exchange rate is related to UK and foreign exchange rate policies. The nature of competitiveness and the demand and supply mechanisms by which it may influence exports are discussed. In the light of this, and the commodity and <b>geographical</b> <b>breakdown</b> of UK exports, we suggest alternative measures of competitiveness which may appropriately be tested in econometric work. Aggregate UK export volume and price equations for the inter- war period are then estimated. Competitiveness, which is in turn influenced by the exchange rate, and the economic position of primary producing countries, are found to have had significant effects on UK export performance. Similarly specified equations are estimated for UK exports in eight industrial sectors. Distinctive characteristics of sectors may lead to substantial divergences between sectoral and aggregate behaviour. This is confirmed in further work on UK coal exports. Nevertheless, measures of the price of UK exports relative to the price of exports of other industrial countries generally give explanations of UK export performance which are superior to other competitiveness measures. A substantial statistical appendix containing data on, inter alia, UK and foreign exchange rates, trade volumes and values (with geographcial and commodity breakdown), labour costs and prices, together with the sources and methods used in their construction, is provided both for historical interest and to facilitate replication of results and further research. </p...|$|R

Thirteen sectors {{were classified as}} freight-intensive sectors (e.g., mineral; construction; manufacturing; accommodation and food, transportation; wholesale trade; retail trade; food) while the other seven are service-oriented (e.g., finance, insurance and real estate; service industries; public administration). The geo-location of the establishments {{in the study area}} made possible the design of a sample that respects the <b>geographical</b> <b>breakdown</b> of establishments with about 13 % at north, 13 % at south, and 74 % in Medellin. The sample was randomly drawn across the ten municipalities of the region. Only 1 % of the establishments listed were not considered in the sample because they are located in rural areas not covered by the survey. Similarly to the geographical distribution, the sample was designed to reproduce the distribution of industry segments {{with the exception of the}} large establishments (more than 200 employees), due to lack of data for this type of establishements. Most of the IIUCs were considered in the sample. The only exceptions were agriculture, livestock, fishing (usually not present in urban areas), other housing service activities, and other services. The data were collected through surveys in 4  months (between February and May of 2012) with a sample of 2947 establishments (4.4 % of the total). About 2 % had major errors and were excluded from the expansion procedure. A set of expansion factors, relating the sample to the universe for each IIUC, were applied to the survey results to obtain the overall picture of internal freight activity.|$|R
40|$|An {{account is}} given {{of the use}} of a {{computerised}} database approach {{to the study of the}} chemistry and botany of streams with a pH at and below 4. 0. the SIEUR (Stream Information Entry, Update and Retrieval) system was designed and implemented on the Northumbrian Universities IBM System 370 computer running under the M. T. S. operating system. SIEUR has been used to store approximately 2500 water chemistry and 2700 biological records. Of these, 269 chemistries and 125 biologies were collected from 10 m reaches from four countries where the pH was at or below 4. 0 on the day of sampling. Principal component and cluster analyses of the acid chemistries suggested that they may be grouped together, based on the level of the various cations measured. This grouping follows closely a <b>geographical</b> <b>breakdown</b> of the sites and is probably a reflection of the mining associations of the majority of the sites. There was no similar grouping of the biological samples. Detailed examination of the distribution of 30 photosynthetic species which occurred live suggested that four patterns of reaction to low pH existed. In the design and practical application of the SIEUR system to the investigation of the acid datasets several problems and some solutions were identified. The need to date, time and location stamp all data at all stages of the analyses was apparent. SIEUR provides an "expansion facility" to overcome the problem of chemical and biological sampling not necessarily occurring together on the same day. By the use of this facility the user can specify the leeway by which chemical and biological samples from the same site are linked to each other in terms of date of sampling. A major design consideration was the need to identify structure in the data and to be able to store and retrieve this as data. During the use of the system the need for comprehensive statistical and graphical facilities was apparent. The decision to provide interfaces to existing packages to do this, rather than provide integral facilities was fully justified in terms of the flexibility obained...|$|R
40|$|This Guide to the {{international}} banking statistics is intended to serve two main purposes: firstly, to provide reporting countries with definitions and guidelines for the reporting of data; secondly, to give {{a detailed account of}} current country practices regarding the coverage and disaggregation of the reported data. The Guide describes two statistical systems, the locational banking statistics and the consolidated banking statistics. It replaces the previous issue (July 2000) and includes numerous changes and updates to the tables on countries' reporting practices. The locational banking statistics, which are described in Part I, gather quarterly data on international financial claims and liabilities of bank offices resident in the reporting countries broken down by currency, sector and country of residence of counterparty, and by nationality of reporting banks. In this system, both domestic and foreign-owned banking offices in the reporting countries record their positions on a gross (unconsolidated) basis, including those vis-à-vis own affiliates, which is consistent with the principles of national accounts, balance of payments and external debt statistics. The statistics were introduced with a breakdown by major individual currencies and a partial sectoral and <b>geographical</b> <b>breakdown</b> {{at the beginning of the}} 1970 s to provide information on the development and growth of the eurocurrency markets. In the subsequent years, the issue of recycling oil-related surpluses and the accompanying rise in international indebtedness shifted the emphasis in favour of a more detailed <b>geographical</b> <b>breakdown</b> and of flow data. The outbreak of the debt crisis in the early 1980 s stimulated further efforts to refine both the geographical coverage of the data and the estimates of exchange rate adjusted flows. In the early 1990 s, strong interest arose in making use of these statistics to improve the coverage and accuracy of the recording of balance of payments transactions. Following the financial crises in emerging economies in the late 1990 s the locational banking statistics became an important component of the Joint BIS-IMF-OECD-World Bank Statistics on External Debt, which were developed in response to requests for dissemination of more timely external debt indicators. The consolidated banking statistics, which are described in Part II, collect quarterly data on banks' international financial claims broken down by remaining maturity and sector of borrower. In addition, they include information on exposures by country of immediate borrower and on the reallocation of claims (ie risk transfers) to the country of ultimate risk. The latter is defined as the country where the guarantor of a claim resides. The data mainly cover claims reported by domestic bank head offices, including the exposures of their foreign affiliates, and are collected on a worldwide consolidated basis with inter-office positions being netted out. The statistics also provide separate data on international claims of foreign bank offices whose head offices are located outside the reporting countries on an unconsolidated basis. The statistics were introduced as a semiannual reporting exercise in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s to provide information on the country risk exposures of major individual nationality banking groups to developing countries. Following the financial crises in emerging economies in the late 1990 s, the consolidated banking statistics were enhanced to include complete country coverage of banks' on-balance sheet exposures, separate country data on an ultimate risk basis and a move to a quarterly reporting frequency. In response to recommendations of a working group of the CGFS, and in order to maintain the consolidated banking statistics as a key source of public information on international financial market developments, it is planned to improve the measurement of commercial banks' consolidated country risk exposures on an ultimate risk basis. Consequently, the statistics will, as from end- 2004, cover more detailed and comprehensive data on country risk exposures inclusive of derivatives and other off-balance sheet positions. Part III of this Guide provides a glossary of terms used in the locational and consolidated banking statistics, while part IV contains a list of international organisations (Appendix 1) and official monetary authorities (Appendix 2). Beginning in 1998, the BIS has invited a number of additional countries, in particular from emerging markets, to participate in {{the international}} banking statistics. This is intended to further increase the global coverage of the statistics. So far, 12 economies have joined the locational (Australia, Bermuda, Brazil, Chile, Guernsey, India, Isle of Man, Jersey, Panama, Portugal, Taiwan (China) and Turkey) and nine have joined the consolidated (Brazil, Chile, Hong Kong, India, Panama, Portugal, Singapore, Taiwan (China), and Turkey) banking statistics, with more countries expected to be included in the near future. The Guide has been prepared with the assistance of the central banks or official authorities contributing to the two sets of international banking statistics. The BIS is grateful to all these institutions for their cooperation and valuable advice in its preparation. ...|$|R

40|$|It {{has long}} been assumed, {{on the basis of}} {{generally}} impressionistic evidence, that Scots were more enthusiastic capital exporters than their English counterparts in the half-century before the First World War. This article offers the initial results of a research project aimed at reassessing Scottish foreign investment in this period. In focusing upon an analysis of new data sets relating to Scottish company registrations for foreign investment and samples drawn from Scottish probate inventories containing foreign assets, this study provides novel insights into the social composition of Scots-resident overseas investors (who rose in number from around 4, 000 in 1867 to 80, 000 in 1913); the <b>geographical</b> and sectoral <b>breakdown</b> of investment activities; and the survival rate of the 853 identified firms registered in Scotland for overseas activities in the 1860 - 1914 period. It also makes a tentative examination of Scottish capital flowing abroad through the London stock market and investment undertaken by Scottish-based financial institutions and multinational enterprises. ...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the factors}} {{limiting}} agricultural development in ACP countries is the difficult access to information on research activities and development experiences. The identification of such information sources constitutes the first step towards {{a better understanding of}} agricultural sciences and techniques. Since CTA's prime objective is to facilitate access to agricultural information in ACP countries, it has undertaken the publication of a series of directories on information sources in the field of agriculture and rural development. The first directory dealt with information sources on tropical agriculture in EEC countries. The second which has just been published in English and French, deals with agricultural information sources in ACP countries. Produced with the cooperation of CAB-lnternational in the UK and the International Documentation Centre for Agriculture in Hot Regions (CIDARC) in France, it fulfills two objectives. First, it is a guide for researchers, trainers, extension workers, planners and documentalists engaged in information searches. Second, it helps to promote information exchanges among different ACP countries and between them and EEC countries. It can also help decision-makers to plan their national policies. This directory includes 337 agricultural information services (libraries, documentation centres, bibliographic databases and documentation networks), research institutes, teaching establishments and development organizations in ACP countries. It deals with all agricultural sectors: agronomic research, teaching and extension work, rural sociology and economics, animal and vegetable production, forestry, aquatic sciences and fishing, agricultural equipment, natural resources, food and nutrition sciences and the environment (a classification of these information services by field is given in Table 1). Apart from the directory itself, which is classified by country in alphabetical order, this publication includes an index of the main fields covered by each centre and a list of acronyms. Each entry includes the name of the information service followed by that of its parent organization, its address, date of establishment, and the name and title of the person to contact in addition to the staff numbers. It specifies the field of interest of the centre, its geographical coverage, its documentation resources, its users, the goods and services that it provides, its budget and its documentation cooperation service. The index was inspired primarily by that used by AGROVOC, the multilingual thesaurus of agricultural terminology and the categories used by AGRIS. The detailed analysis of the data contained in this directory reveals the current situation of agricultural documentation in ACP countries. It shows that the first agricultural information services date from the last century. The Jamaican Ministry of Agriculture created its national agricultural library in 1876. Since the 1920 s, the number of such centres has increased rapidly. At the current rate, one can hope to see more than 500 agricultural information sources in ACP countries by the year 2000 A <b>geographical</b> <b>breakdown</b> of this data reveals a strong development in West Africa which hosts more than 36 % of the agricultural information services of ACP countries (see Table 3). Documentation centres appear to be concentrated mainly in the capitals to the detriment of rural areas which would make much-later use of such information. These centres offer traditional services: providing bibliographic searches, summary reviews, lists of documents received, and catalogues of publications and periodicals as well as services for selected diffusion of information and for bibliographic searches. However, the summaries and progress reports receive relatively little attention {{despite the fact that they}} are highly regarded by 'information consumers'. The same is the case for the services of consolidation, evaluation and updating of information. It is true that researchers, teachers and students, who are the main users of these information services, are capable of doing such summaries and analyses themselves. Nevertheless, the demand for summarized information remains high. The dearth of such material is due in part to the lack of competent staff The collections of these information services are, generally speaking, relatively modest. Some centres, however, do have significant documentation resources. On average, each one contains 3217 books, 1534 reports, 375 publications of the parent organization 169 periodical titles and 495 microfiches. As far as equipment is concerned even though ACP countries are the least computerized, it is reassuring to learn that nearly a third of the information services have microcomputers although of many different brands. This diversity of equipment, which also applies to software, is no doubt a result of supply and demand but it creates problems of compatability which makes it difficult to exchange data needed for documentary cooperation. An analysis of such data also reveals that there is a greater reproduction capacity than previously thought. If only 7. 4 % of the information services have their own microfilm reproduction workshops, 55 % of the centres have microfilm or microfiche readers. Finally, the most significant phenomenon in the development of information services in ACP countries over the last decade has been the emergence of documentation networks and the exchange of information and experiences. All of the synergies and economies of scale have been exploited: interlibrary loans development of collective catalogues for periodicals and reference works, standardization of working methods, and promotion of the exploitation of their documentation capital. National sectoral networks have emerged in the Congo (REDICA), Cote d'lvoire (REDACT) and Senegal (REDAS). At regional level, the approach taken has been the establishment of a network reflecting the major socioeconomic and geopolitical concerns. One notes the presence of PADIS, oriented towards socioeconomic development in Africa of POPIN-AFRICA oriented towards the population problems of this continent, and RESADOC in Mali which is primarily concerned with problems related to drought, desertification and environmental protection. At the international level, AGRIS and CARIS remain the main global information systems. The establishment of these networks, no matter what their level, in conjunction with the use of computerized facilities, clearly shows the vitality of the documentation supply in ACP countries. It is certain, however, that these structures remain fragile and do not get sufficient attention or support. A new item must be added to the priorities of these centres: the analysis of agricultural information to provide products that respond better to the real needs of users for summarized documents. In this field, as in many others, the availability of human resources will be the determining factor. For more details, contact: Thiendou Niang.

40|$|Introduction A {{revised version}} of this paper has been {{released}} in July 2009. The origins of BIS activities in the field of international financial statistics go back to the mid- 1960 s and the emergence of the so-called eurocurrency markets that had sprung up to circumvent domestic regulations. At that time the key policy concern that gave rise to the joint data collection exercise by the central banks of the G 10 countries {{under the aegis of the}} BIS was the need to monitor the rapid growth of these markets and its possible monetary implications. This led to the introduction of reporting by internationally active banks of their international positions in major individual currencies, with a geographical and partial sectoral breakdown. On the basis of these reports the central banks and the BIS compiled the so-called locational banking statistics for various lending and borrowing countries. In the subsequent years, the issue of recycling the current account surpluses of oil-producing countries shifted the emphasis in favour of a more detailed <b>geographical</b> <b>breakdown</b> and of flow data. In the context of the deregulation of domestic financial systems and capital flows in the 1970 s and 1980 s these concerns abated, but in their place came others, notably the rise in the indebtedness of many developing countries to international banks in the early 1980 s. This build-up was visible in the existing locational banking statistics collected and published by the BIS, but it was not possible to evaluate in a comprehensive way the risk characteristics of the exposures of national banking systems to individual borrowing countries. The need for such information therefore led to the reporting of a second set of international banking data on a fully consolidated basis. A maturity breakdown of the consolidated banking claims was also introduced at that time. In response to calls for more up-to-date information on the international lending activities of banks, the BIS began in the early 1990 s to collect and publish data on signed syndicated credit facilities. More recently, with the objective of enhancing the analysis of country risk exposures, efforts have been made to achieve a more complete and detailed reporting of consolidated banking data on an ultimate risk basis, including off-balance sheet positions relating to bank's derivatives transactions. As a result of the increasing role of the international securities markets in global financial intermediation, the BIS was mandated in the mid- 1980 s to collect and publish statistics on these markets on the basis of data from commercial databases and information available to individual central banks. In the 1990 s the BIS also became increasingly involved in the coordination of joint surveys that central banks carried out on a regular basis to monitor activity in global foreign exchange markets. Moreover, as derivatives markets expanded in the wake of financial innovation, central banks asked the BIS to collect and publish international data on exchange-traded and over-the-counter derivatives transactions. The development of the BIS international financial statistics thus reflects evolving central bank concerns relating to monetary and financial stability in the context of worldwide financial market deregulation, innovation and globalisation. In addition to their use for policy-related monitoring purposes by central banks, the international financial statistics have meanwhile proved to be of interest to private sector market participants. The latter have come to recognise the unique value of the BIS data for tracking the borrowing by emerging market countries from the international banking and securities markets. The BIS data are also used by the IMF in the compilation of its international financial statistics and in its surveillance of individual economies. Moreover, the BIS data have proved to be useful for improving balance of payment statistics and for measuring and monitoring developing countries' foreign debt. With respect to the latter, following the 1997 Asian debt crisis the IMF, OECD, World Bank and BIS pooled their respective statistics to collectively publish data from creditor and market sources on countries' foreign indebtedness. Apart from providing insights into the geographical distributions of international financial flows and external vulnerabilities and risk exposures of debtors and creditors, the international financial statistics collected and disseminated by the BIS contain important information on the structural developments in international financial markets. They can be used, for instance, to analyse the importance of individual financial centres (including so-called offshore centres), the emergence of new relationships between financial and non-financial firms, the level and concentration of activity in financial markets as well as spillovers between different market segments. Much of this is not easily available elsewhere. The statistics become even more valuable when they are combined with other sources covering financial asset prices, market liquidity and trading patterns, external ratings, and the activity of non-bank financial firms and non-financial companies. They then allow market participants and policymakers to make an assessment of credit and liquidity risks in domestic and international financial markets as well as of potential vulnerabilities to systemic disturbances in these markets. The usefulness of the international financial statistics is, of course, potentially affected by the fact that the boundaries between international and domestic markets are becoming more blurred. This could, on the one hand, constitute a weakness of the statistics as it may become increasingly difficult to define and distinguish pure international financial market activity from that in domestic markets. On the other hand, as this guide explains and illustrates, the methodology of the international statistics has tried to keep pace with such developments and to ensure that financial analysts are aware of the limitations of the statistics. Moreover, given that financial innovations have often started in the competitive environment of the international financial markets and that market sentiments are becoming increasingly correlated internationally, the BIS statistics have been and continue to be a very useful tool to capture structural and market developments in global markets at an early stage. The BIS, and the central banking community working through it, have also taken steps to complement the publication of the international financial statistics with a selection of highlights and analyses of major market trends. In the case of the BIS this applies to the press releases accompanying the release of new data; to the BIS Quarterly Review, which contains more in-depth analysis of specific issues, and to its Annual Report, which analyses long-term trends and emerging policy issues. The statistics are also mentioned and explained regularly in presentations by senior BIS officials to central banks, market participants and academics. Other initiatives to promote the use of the statistics include making them available in electronic form on the BIS website and updating the guidelines and methodological notes on a regular basis. Work on collecting, compiling and disseminating the BIS international financial statistics is closely related to, and guided by, the activities of the various Basel-based committees and expert groups as well as those of other international institutions. The Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS) plays a key role in reaching a consensus on priorities to improve the BIS statistics. With respect to international banking data, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) is consulted on methodological issues to help ensure the collection of adequate statistical information from internationally active banks on risk exposures. The Financial Stability Forum (FSF) has also formulated a number of recommendations to enhance statistics on international financial markets and capital flows that are taken into account by the BIS in its statistical work. As a result of the strong support of these groups it has been possible to improve on the reporting frequency and timeliness of the international financial statistics in recent years. One of the major underlying objectives of the various Basel-based groups is to strengthen financial stability through transparency and market discipline. Increased public disclosure plays a key role in this and should, over time, lead to better quantitative and qualitative information on the activities and risk profiles of individual institutions as well as market infrastructures such as payment, settlement and trading systems. With respect to the functioning of domestic and international financial markets, various proposals have been made to complement the BIS statistics on banking, securities, foreign exchange and derivatives markets over time by improved aggregate information on liquidity, leverage and position-taking in these markets. More recently the IMF has been elaborating a methodology for the collection by individual countries of comprehensive financial soundness indicators, which should complement the BIS statistics. The disclosure framework on the exposures and capital structure of internationally active banks proposed under the New Basel Capital Accord (its so-called Pillar III) should contribute to better balance sheet data of individual internationally active banks. This Guide is structured around the three main areas of the BIS international financial statistics: the international banking statistics (Part II); the securities statistics (Part III); and the derivatives and foreign exchange statistics (Parts IV and V). It also provides a description of the joint BIS-IMF-OECD-World Bank statistics on external debt for which the BIS is a main contributor of data (Part VI). The guide provides a detailed description of the sources, compilation, transformation and publication of the data. Two separate chapters on the quality and the uses of the statistics (Parts VII and VIII) follow the description of the statistics. A more detailed description of the BIS international banking statistics and their underlying methodology is provided in a separate guide. This Guide has been prepared by Paul Van den Bergh, Rainer Widera, Karsten von Kleist, Jesper Wormstrup and others in the Monetary and Economic Department of the BIS. Chapter VIII draws largely on an article by Philip Wooldridge. ...|$|R
