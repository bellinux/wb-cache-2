According to Cuba, the political, economical and technical cost to South Africa of maintaining its presence in Angola proved too much. Conversely, the South Africans believe that they indicated their resolve to the superpowers by preparing a nuclear test that ultimately forced the Cubans into a settlement.|$|E

5|$|In August 1899, Gellibrand easily {{passed the}} {{examinations}} for promotion to captain, but was {{passed over for}} the post of adjutant of the 2nd Battalion of the South Lancashire Regiment, then based in St Helens, Merseyside. In October the post became vacant again, {{and this time he}} secured it. The South African War had broken out, and the 2nd Battalion embarked <b>for</b> <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> on 30 November, but Gellibrand was left behind, in charge of the regimental depot. He eventually received orders to embark <b>for</b> <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> with reinforcements on 3 January 1900. He arrived in South Africa on 25 January 1900. Soon after, he was given command of D Company. As such he participated in the relief of Ladysmith, leading a bayonet charge on 27 February. His company entered the town on 3 March. Five days later he became ill with typhoid, and lay in a comatose state until 3 April. He was joined in Durban by Elsie, who had made her way out to South Africa with Cecil Rhodes, and they embarked for England together on 26 May, arriving at Southampton on 18 June.|$|E

Anthea Stewart, who had played <b>for</b> <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. Liz Chase, the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain.

The squad included twin sisters in Sandy Chick and Sonia Robertson.|$|E
5|$|After he {{returned}} to Australia, Dartnell married Elizabeth Edith Smyth on 15 April 1907 at Holt's Matrimonial Agency on Queen Street, Melbourne. They settled in Fitzroy, and had a daughter in 1908. Little is known about Dartnell's life {{over the next few}} years, though it is thought that he managed his own business and worked as an actor until 1912 or 1913, when he again departed <b>for</b> <b>South</b> <b>Africa.</b> Elizabeth and their daughter remained in Victoria, while Dartnell established himself in East London, a coastal city in the Cape Province. He found employment with the Standard Printing Company, and was a regular contributor to their Saturday newspaper, the Weekly Standard.

5|$|Each {{breakdown}} or setback {{during the}} early years of Smith's premiership prompted press speculation that Harper might replace him. In 1966, when Smith brought a working document back from the HMS Tiger talks with the British Prime Minister Harold Wilson, Harper led opposition to the terms in Cabinet, contributing to their rejection. Harper resigned from the Rhodesian Front in 1968, soon after Smith dismissed him from the Cabinet, reportedly because Harper had had an extramarital affair with a British agent. He subsequently became a vocal critic of the Prime Minister, greeting each step Smith made towards settlement with black nationalists during the Bush War with public indignation. By the time majority rule began in Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979, following the Internal Settlement of the previous year, Harper had left <b>for</b> <b>South</b> <b>Africa.</b> He died in 2006 at the age of 90.|$|E
