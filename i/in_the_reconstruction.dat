5|$|Literature in Virginia often {{deals with}} the state's {{extensive}} and sometimes troubled past.

Glasgow's peer and close friend James Branch Cabell wrote extensively about the changing position of gentry <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reconstruction</b> era, and challenged its moral code with Jurgen, A Comedy of Justice. William Styron approached history in works such as The Confessions of Nat Turner and Sophie's Choice. Tom Wolfe has occasionally dealt with his southern heritage in bestsellers like I Am Charlotte Simmons. Mount Vernon native Matt Bondurant received critical acclaim for his historic novel The Wettest County in the World about moonshiners in Franklin County during prohibition. Virginia also names a state Poet Laureate.|$|E

From 2005 until 2008 a battalion-sized Australian Army battle group (initially designated the Al Muthanna Task Group, and later Overwatch Battle Group (West)) was stationed in southern Iraq. In addition, teams of ADF personnel were deployed to train Iraqi military units.

In attempts to lessen the effects of disease and famine, 5,000tons (4,536tonnes) of food was planned to be distributed in the region during this time.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} the rest of Mesoamerica, the Maya {{believed}} in a supernatural realm inhabited by an array of powerful deities. These deities needed to be placated with ceremonial offerings and ritual practices. At the core of Maya religious practice was the worship of deceased ancestors, who would act as go-betweens for their living descendants in dealings with the denizens of the supernatural realm. The earliest intermediaries between humans and the supernatural realm were shamans. Maya ritual included the use of hallucinogens for chilan (oracular) priests. Visions for the chilan were likely facilitated by consumption of water lilies, which are hallucinogenic in high doses. As the Maya civilization developed, the ruling elite codified the general concepts held by Maya society, and developed them into religious cults that justified their right to rule. In the Late Preclassic, the pinnacle of this process was the combination of ultimate political and religious power in the divine king, the k'uhul ajaw. Although it is difficult to reconstruct the belief system through archaeology, some indicators of ritual practice do leave physical traces. These include dedicatory caches and other ritual deposits, shrines, and burials and their associated funerary offerings. In addition, Maya art, architecture, and writing all assist <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>reconstruction</b> of ancient Maya beliefs; these can be combined with ethnographic sources, including records of Maya religious practices made by the Spanish during the conquest.|$|E

40|$|NSFC [11002071, 10931004, 91203110]In this paper, we {{extend a}} class of the Hermite {{weighted}} essentially non-oscillatory (HWENO) schemes for solving the Hamilton-Jacobi equations by Qiu and Shu (2005) [24] to two dimensional unstructured meshes. The idea of <b>the</b> <b>reconstruction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> HWENO schemes comes from the original WENO schemes, however both the function and its first two derivative values are evolved via time advancing and used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>reconstructions,</b> while only <b>the</b> function values are evolved and used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original WENO schemes which are nodal based approximations. The third and fourth order HWENO schemes using the combinations of second order approximations with nonlinear weights and TVD Runge-Kutta time discretization method are used here. Comparing with the original WENO schemes for Hamilton-Jacobi equations, one major advantage of HWENO schemes presented here is its compactness <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>reconstructions.</b> Extensive numerical tests are performed to illustrate the capability and high order accuracy of the methodologies.

5|$|The Secretaría de Gobernación {{declared}} a state of emergency in 21 of Nuevo León's 51 municipalities, freeing federal disaster funds for use in aid operations. An additional 10 municipalities were placed under the state of emergency on July8. A similar declaration was made for 8 municipalities in Oaxaca, and for 14 municipalities in Tamaulipas; the state of emergency in Tamaulipas was later expanded to 30 municipalities. Mexican President Felipe Calderón requested adding resources to the federal disaster fund, as the $3 billion (2010 MXN; $235 million USD) it held would not be sufficient to face the damage in Coahuila, Nuevo León and Tamaulipas. In the months following the storm, a total of $4.8 billion (2010 MXN; $375 million USD) was released by the federal and state governments to aid <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>reconstruction</b> of the disaster areas in Nuevo León and Tamaulipas. In Texas, Governor Rick Perry activated the state's search and rescue capabilities in Laredo and San Antonio. This activation was due to the flooding on the Rio Grande Valley, which was expected to worsen due to the approach of Tropical Depression Two to the area affected by Alex.|$|E
