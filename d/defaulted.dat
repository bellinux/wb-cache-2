5|$|Solidarity lending is a {{cornerstone}} of microcredit, and the system is now used in more than 43 countries. Although each borrower must belong to a five-member group, the group {{is not required to}} give any guarantee for a loan to its members. Repayment responsibility rests solely on the individual borrower. The group and the centre oversee that everyone behaves responsibly and none gets into a repayment problem. No formal joint liability exists, i.e. group members are not obliged to pay on behalf of a defaulting member. But, in practice the group members often contribute the <b>defaulted</b> amount with an intention to collect the money from the <b>defaulted</b> member at a later time. Such behaviour is encouraged because Grameen does not extend further credit to a group in which a member defaults.|$|E

We also suggest a valuation method for credit <b>default</b> swap (CDS) with (or without) counterparty <b>default</b> risk (CDR) and basket <b>default</b> swap under this model. Our numerical results provide us with several meaningful implications. First, <b>default</b> swap spread is higher in economic recession than in economic expansion across <b>default</b> swap maturity. Second, as the difference of asset return volatility between under bear market and under bull market increases, CDS spread increases regardless of maturity.

50|$|Contagion <b>default</b> {{modeling}} can {{be viewed}} as a variation of CID modeling. As discussed in section 2.3, in the CID framework, correlation is modeled by conditioning on a common market factor M, which impacts all entities to the same degree. The lower the random drawing for M, the higher is the <b>default</b> intensity of all entities (unless ρ = 0). Hence CID modeling can elucidate <b>default</b> clustering. In contrast, contagion approaches model the <b>default</b> intensity of an entity as a function of the <b>default</b> of another entity. Hence contagion <b>default</b> modeling incorporates counterparty risk, i.e. the direct impact of a <b>defaulting</b> entity on the <b>default</b> intensity of another entity. In particular, after a <b>default</b> of a particular entity, the <b>default</b> intensity of all assets in the portfolio increases. This <b>default</b> contagion then typically fades exponentially to non-contagious <b>default</b> intensity levels. See the papers of Davis and Lo (2001) and Jarrow and Yu (2001), who pioneered contagion <b>default</b> modeling.|$|R

5|$|Iceland, {{not part}} of the EU, is {{regarded}} as one of Europe's recovery success stories. It <b>defaulted</b> on its debt and drastically devalued its currency, which has effectively reduced wages by 50% making exports more competitive. Lee Harris argues that floating exchange rates allows wage reductions by currency devaluations, a politically easier option than the economically equivalent but politically impossible method of lowering wages by political enactment. Sweden's floating rate currency gives it a short-term advantage, structural reforms and constraints account for longer-term prosperity. Labour concessions, a minimal reliance on public debt, and tax reform helped to further a pro-growth policy.|$|E
40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{reasoning}} about preferences among properties (outcomes, desiderata, etc.) in Reiter's <b>default</b> logic.

This translation is accomplished via the naming of <b>defaults,</b> so that reference may be made to a <b>default</b> rule from within a theory. In an elaboration of the approach, we allow an ordered <b>default</b> theory where preference information is specified within a <b>default</b> theory.

40|$|This paper {{suggests}} a methodology for valuing credit <b>default</b> swaps that takes account of counterparty <b>default</b> risk {{as well as}} correlated market and credit risk.
