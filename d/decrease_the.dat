40|$|Casinos {{could help}} inhibit the {{development}} of pathological gambling by limiting the contributions they make to {{the development of}} pathology among gamblers. Reasonable strategies for limiting pathology might include limiting the size of jackpots, <b>decreasing</b> <b>the</b> length of play, limiting access, <b>decreasing</b> <b>the</b> rate of play, <b>decreasing</b> <b>the</b> arousal of patrons, <b>decreasing</b> <b>the</b> variability of games, and <b>decreasing</b> <b>the</b> inducements to play. These strategies could be employed in the domains of accessibility, environment, game structure, promotion|marketing, education and treatment. The author argues that the implementation of these strategies would not only inhibit the development of pathological gambling, but might also benefit the casinos and society. The suggested changes in casinos offers a focal point for further research and further dialogues between clinicians and casino operators. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R

Sterile insect technique is a genetic control method whereby large numbers of sterile male mosquitoes are reared and released. Mating with wild females reduces the wild population in the subsequent generation; repeated releases eventually eliminate the target population.|$|E
5|$|Alcohols do not {{normally}} behave as acids in water, but {{the presence of}} a double bond adjacent to the OH group can substantially <b>decrease</b> <b>the</b> pKa by the mechanism of keto–enol tautomerism. Ascorbic acid is an example of this effect. The diketone 2,4-pentanedione (acetylacetone) is also a weak acid because of the keto–enol equilibrium. In aromatic compounds, such as phenol, which have an OH substituent, conjugation with the aromatic ring as a whole greatly increases the stability of the deprotonated form.|$|E

Early harvest could therefore be recommended for best control measures in storage facilities.|$|E
