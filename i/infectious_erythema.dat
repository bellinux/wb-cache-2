40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the study of {{clinical}} symptoms and laboratory changes at parvovirus B 19 infection in children during the rise of the incidence of <b>infectious</b> <b>erythema.</b> 44 children ailing with laboratory confirmed parvovirus B 19 infection aging from 2 months to 14 years were complexly examined. It was established that the disease occurs mainly in boys of preschool and early school age, with a seasonal rise in April and May. General infectious syndrome and syndrome of exanthema dominate the clinical picture. <b>Infectious</b> <b>erythema</b> has benign course. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} features of an <b>infectious</b> <b>erythema</b> which affected {{children and young}} people are described. Other writers have described the same disease and have suggested a viral origin. A cytological method is described which may establish the diagnosis, and the cytological appearances might also be useful in differentiating between erythema and measles...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{estimate}} parvovirus B 19 (PV B 19) infection (<b>infectious</b> <b>erythema)</b> prevalence in North-West Russia. In 2009 - 2011 anti-IgM antibodies against PV B 19 among 12, 5 % of patients with exanthematous disease was detected in 9 (from 11) administrative territories of N-W region. Prevalence of anti-IgG antibodies in pregnant females (risk group) vary from 37, 5 to 83, 3 %% in various age groups. Sufficient that most reproductively active females age group (18 – 35 yo) belongs to the group of risk: 49, 2 % (in St-Petersburg) and 40, 5 % (in Vologda) were anti-IgG PV B 19 negative.  Rational clinical laboratory diagnostics and modern surveilliance of PV B 19 and other exanthematous diseases were discussed. </p...|$|E
40|$|Erythema infectiositm is a {{childhood}} illness characterized by mild constitutional symptoms and a blotchy or maculo-papular lacy rash on the cheeks (slapped - cheek) spreading {{primarily to the}} extremities and trunk. The disease- is-caused by human parvovirus B 19. Erythema infectiosum epidemics occur in a cyclic fashion, mostly during winter and spring months. The diagnosis of erythema infectiosum is usually based on the appearance and pattern of the rash. The aim of our study was to establish the frequency and clinical characteristics of erythema infectiosum in children, in the period between 2000 and 2004 at the Institute of Child and Youth Health Care, Department of Dermatology, Novi Sad. There were 0. 23 % of children with a clinical picture of <b>infectious</b> <b>erythema.</b> There was an outbreak of erythema infectiosum from December 2001 to September 2002. The highest number of cases was detected in April and May of 2002. from 2003 to 2004, no cases with infekctious erythema were diagnosed. The average age of infected children was 7. 38. Female children were affected slightly more often than male (56. 41 %: 43. 58 %). Pruritus was detected in 10. 26 % of children. The most constant clinical sign was reticular exanthema on the limbs, present in 100 % of cases, followed by 89. 74 % of cheek exanthema, while limb and trunk exanthema was present in 7. 68 % of children. Adenopathies and mild constitutional symptoms were present in 5. 12 % of children. No complications were recorded {{in any of the}} cases. ...|$|E
