40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{prioritized}} <b>e-mail</b> <b>servicing</b> on <b>e-mail</b> servers {{to reduce the}} delay and loss of non-spam e-mails due to queuing. Using a prioritized two-queue scheme, non-spam e-mails are queued in a fast queue and given higher service priority than spam e-mails that are queued in a slow queue. Four prioritized <b>e-mail</b> <b>service</b> strategies for the two-queue scheme are proposed and analyzed. We modeled these four strategies using discrete-time Markov chain analysis under different e-mail traffic loads and <b>service</b> capacities. Non-spam <b>e-mails</b> can be delivered within a small delay, even under heavy e-mail loadings and high spam-to-non-spam a priori. Results from our analysis of the two-queue scheme show that it gives non-spam delay and loss probability two orders of magnitude smaller than the typical single-queue approach during heavy spam traffic. Moreover, prioritized <b>e-mail</b> <b>servicing</b> protects <b>e-mail</b> servers from spam attacks...|$|R
