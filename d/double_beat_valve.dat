50|$|In {{the early}} nineteenth century the <b>double</b> <b>beat</b> <b>valve</b> was known as the Cornish Valve, a synonym that persisted until the early 20th century. The Cornish Valve, as used on early beam engines, was invented by Murdock, an {{assistant}} of James Watt, in 1820.|$|E
5000|$|When used in {{high-pressure}} applications, for example, as admission valves on steam engines, {{the same}} pressure that helps seal poppet valves also contributes {{significantly to the}} force required to open them. This {{has led to the}} development of the balanced poppet or <b>double</b> <b>beat</b> <b>valve,</b> in which two valve plugs ride on a common stem, with the pressure on one plug largely balancing the pressure on the other. [...] In these valves, the force needed to open the valve is determined by the pressure and the difference between the areas of the two valve openings. Sickels patented a valve gear for double-beat poppet valves in 1842. Criticism was reported in the journal Science in 1889 of equilibrium poppet valves (called by the article the 'double or balanced or American puppet valve') in use for paddle steamer engines, that by its nature it must leak 15 percent.|$|E
50|$|The winding {{engine was}} {{replaced}} in 1869 by one with 2 horizontal cylinders 25in bore and 60in stroke. They had <b>double</b> <b>beat</b> <b>valves.</b> The rope drum was 14 ft in diameter. This engine {{was still working}} in 1926 when the pit closed. A further engine was installed to haul tubs up a 900yard, 1 in 7 incline in the Accommodation seam. It had two horizontal cylinders 15in by 30in geared to a five-foot winding drum. Both were fed steam at 30 psi by three Lancashire Boilers.|$|R
50|$|Double-beat poppet valves became {{widely used}} during the nineteenth century. Francis Stevens invented the Stevens <b>valve</b> gear, a <b>double</b> <b>beat</b> poppet <b>valve,</b> in 1839. It was used {{throughout}} {{the nineteenth century and}} {{in the early years of}} the 20th, on side-wheel paddle steamer engines, including the grasshopper engine, in the United States. The Lentz gear, of German origin, was first applied in Germany in 1899 where it became widespread, and was subsequently also manufactured in the United States. The Putnam engine, a high pressure variable cut-off steam engine built by Putnam Machinery Co. in the United States, featured four <b>double</b> <b>beat</b> poppet <b>valves</b> operated from a single camshaft.|$|R
50|$|The {{high-pressure}} cylinder is 24-inch bore by 6-foot stroke, and the low-pressure cylinder is 38-inch bore by 8-foot stroke. Steam is distributed {{by means of}} <b>double</b> <b>beat</b> 'Cornish' <b>valves,</b> mounted in upper and lower valve chests. The cylinders act {{on one end of}} the beam, via Watt's parallel motion. The beam itself is 26 feet 4 inches between end centres, 4 feet deep at the centre, weighs 13 tons and is carried on 12 in bearings.|$|R

A fuzzy logic air conditioning controller with two inputs and one output has been designed with an industrial application in mind. This system consists of two sensors for feedback control: one to monitor temperature and another one to monitor humidity. There are three control elements: cooling <b>valve,</b> <b>beating</b> <b>valve,</b> and humidifying valve, to adjust the temperature and humidity of the air supply. A fuzzy rule for this controller is formulated by temperature and humidity. The model of this controller has been tested using MATLAB simulation...|$|R

Very Hard mode is basically Hard mode rotated 180 degrees, with markers being smaller and appearing faster, thus allowing less response time.
