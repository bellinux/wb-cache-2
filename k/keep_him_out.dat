However, his recovery took longer than expected {{and it was not}} until the end of the season that Johnson was able to start running again, delaying any comeback until at least the start of the 2006–07 season. That comeback failed to materialise, and in September 2006, Johnson retired from professional football on the advice of his doctors, with his sights now set on coaching.|$|E

In his rookie season, Pineda was named an All-Star and finished fifth in balloting for American League Rookie of the Year. After his rookie season, he {{was traded to the}} Yankees. He missed the 2012 and 2013 seasons due to a series of shoulder injuries. Pineda's 2017 season ended due to Tommy John surgery, which will <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> until late 2018.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a secret}} {{agreement}} originally stated that Odlum would take power after six months, {{his support for}} Cuba and similar left-wing nations led to American pressure to <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> <b>out.</b> After months of negotiations, Odlum was dismissed as Deputy Prime Minister, and the ensuing government weakness and infighting led to its defeat in the 1982 election. In opposition, Odlum was made Ambassador to the United Nations, resigning in 1996. When the Labour Party came to power again a year later, he became Foreign Minister, overseeing the establishment of stronger relations with both Cuba and China. Amidst controversy over his alleged alliance with the opposition, Odlum resigned in 2001. Never again returning to power, he died on 28 September 2003 following a battle with pancreatic cancer.|$|E

Cena then retained his title against Rollins the following night on Raw and then in a steel cage match at WWE Live from Madison Square Garden. At Hell in a Cell, Cena lost the title to the returning Alberto Del Rio in an open challenge.

5|$|Much {{like the}} {{previous}} year, {{one-third of the}} reigning Mexican National Trios Champions was unable to further help defend the title. This year, CMLL resolved the situation differently, but still managed to organize in a tournament. The champions, Mascara Dorada, Stuka Jr., and Metro, successfully defended their championship on November 15, 2010, in Arena Puebla. Dorada suffered an ankle injury {{during the course of}} the match. Citing both the injury (which would <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> a month) and, more so, the demands of his other three championships, Mascara Dorada vacated his share of the titles three days later. CMLL broke with the precedent of forcing the entire team to vacate the titles and instead declared a web poll would determine a replacement for Mascara Dorada. Voting was held for over two weeks on CMLL.com.|$|E
5|$|After Cristiano Ronaldo's {{transfer}} to Real Madrid in the 2009 close season, {{the weight of}} expectation was on Nani to step up from bit part player and replace his compatriot. Nani's first contribution to United's new season was opening the scoring in the tenth minute of the 2009 FA Community Shield, but United eventually lost the match on penalties after a 2–2 draw. Nani suffered a dislocated shoulder during the match, which was originally expected to <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of {{the start of the}} season. He recovered in time to play 17 minutes for Portugal against Liechtenstein on 12 August, however, and started the match against Birmingham City on 16 August. Although he provided the assist for Wayne Rooney's winning goal in the 34th minute, Nani was replaced by Ryan Giggs at half-time. On 22 August, Nani scored his first league goal of the 2009–10 season, a free-kick against Wigan Athletic in a 0–5 away win.|$|E
5|$|Carruthers {{made his}} first {{appearance}} of 2010–11 in the opening match, a 2–1 home defeat to Kidderminster Harriers on 14 August 2010, {{in which he was}} substituted in the 65th minute. He suffered a knee injury in a 3–0 home victory over Altrincham on 28 August 2010 and it was believed this would <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of the team for a month. Carruthers made his return as an 81st-minute substitute in a 2–0 victory away to Kidderminster in the FA Cup fourth qualifying round on 23 October 2010. His first start since August 2010 came in a 3–0 home victory over League Two club Rotherham United in an FA Cup first round replay on 17 November. He scored his first goal of the season in the 87th minute of a 2–1 defeat away to Darlington on 23 April 2011. His season finished with 29 appearances and 1 goal and was released by York on 23 June 2011.|$|E

5|$|Columbus also traded {{former first}} round draft pick Nikita Filatov to the Ottawa Senators for a third-round {{pick in the}} 2011 Draft. Filatov had {{failed to live up}} to {{expectations}} in Columbus, playing in only 44 games over three seasons scoring six goals. Prior to the start of the season, the Blue Jackets were questioned for not signing a veteran back-up to starting goaltender Steve Mason, as the former Calder Memorial Trophy winner had struggled in consecutive seasons. The Blue Jackets signed Mark Dekanich as the back-up who had only 50 minutes of NHL experience prior to the start of the season. Columbus did sign a veteran Curtis Sanford to be their third string goaltender and to start for their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Springfield Falcons. Sanford had not played in the NHL since 2009. During training camp, Dekanich suffered a high ankle sprain that was expected to <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of the line-up for a month. Additionally, Sanford suffered a groin injury, leaving Allen York as the back-up. York had only played four professional games, all in the AHL, entering the season.|$|E
5|$|Coulson was {{released}} by Barnsley {{at the end of}} the season, leaving him free to join Grimsby permanently, signing a two-year contract on 31 May 2010. In the third match of 2010–11, at home to Hayes & Yeading United on 21 August 2010, he took a kick to his ankle, which was expected to <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of the team for a month. He returned on 18 September 2010 after starting in a 2–1 defeat at home to Fleetwood Town, but was substituted at half-time. Coulson made a goalscoring second comeback from his ankle injury in Grimsby's 2–2 home draw with Eastbourne Borough on 30 October 2010. For the first time as a Grimsby player he scored twice in one match in a 2–1 victory at home to AFC Wimbledon on 5 March 2011, with a first-half shot into the bottom left of the goal and a second-half shot into the top-left corner from inside the penalty area. Coulson's first season as a permanent Grimsby player concluded having scored nine goals in 33 appearances.|$|E
5|$|His mother {{raised the}} family, {{including}} Coleman's brother (Lillashawn) and sister, in the Humboldt Park community area, then the West Side and finally Oak Park. Coleman describes his stepfather as a long-time gang member with an extensive criminal record. After enduring formative years with gunfights outside elementary school, home loss {{due to an}} apartment fire, and expulsion hearings, his stepfather, Mose Oliver, introduced him to wrestling to <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of trouble. Federal records confirm that Oliver is an alleged 1990s gang enforcer who served time from 2004 to 2011 for participation in Operation Day Trader. The wrestling started in about 2001. By sixth grade both his father and stepfather were incarcerated and his father figure was his wrestling coach, Mike Powell. Coleman attended Ella Flagg Young elementary school. Barral raised her family with little assistance away from the gang influences of the West Side. She applied for section 8 assistance. Coleman, who was nearly expelled as a sophomore, graduated from Oak Park and River Forest High School in Oak Park, IL in 2009. He has studied at Northern Michigan University.|$|E

5|$|In July 2014, Carrick {{suffered}} an injury during a pre-season training session that {{was expected to}} <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> for 12 weeks. Carrick's first game back from injury came at the 1–0 defeat against Manchester City on 2 November 2014, where he came on as a replacement centre-back following Chris Smalling's dismissal. After Marcos Rojo suffered a dislocated shoulder in the same match, Carrick stated {{that he would be}} happy to play as a makeshift centre-back. After Carrick returned to the starting line-up on a regular basis, Match of the Day 2 pundit Dietmar Hamann attributed some of Manchester United's improved form to Carrick's return in December, after the club had won all of the six games that he had started. Sir Alex Ferguson stated that he thought Carrick was the best English player in an interview with BT Sport in December 2014, shortly after Carrick had been named as Manchester United's new vice-captain by Louis van Gaal. On 15 March 2015, he provided an assist for Marouane Fellaini's goal, and scored his first goal {{in more than a year}} during a 3–0 victory against his former club Tottenham Hotspur. On 20 March 2015, Carrick signed a new one-year extension to his contract, lengthening his Manchester United career to 10 seasons.|$|E
5|$|The {{start of}} Johnson's career at League One side Bradford City {{was marred by}} an ankle {{ligament}} injury in a pre-season friendly at Boston United which was expected to <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of {{the first month of}} the season. He recovered to make his debut in City's 2006–07 season's opening game at Nottingham Forest as a late substitute. Two weeks later he scored his first Bradford goals by netting twice against his former club Crewe in a 3–0 Bradford victory. Johnson struggled for goals at City, and had only scored another two {{by the time he was}} ruled out for a month after going off at half-time against Chesterfield on 16 December 2006 with a shin injury. He returned to the City team after a six-game absence for a Friday night game with Tranmere Rovers, which ended 1–1. He had a goal disallowed against Yeovil Town a week later for offside. Following a poor run of form, City manager Colin Todd was sacked, with his replacement David Wetherall converting Johnson from a striker to a midfielder after an injury to Marc Bridge-Wilkinson. However, City were relegated after a defeat to Chesterfield with Johnson finishing the season with just four goals.|$|E
5|$|Abu Nuwar {{became a}} vociferous critic of British aid to Jordan, viewing it {{as a form}} of {{dependency}} on Jordan's former colonial ruler, and of Glubb Pasha, the influential British officer in charge of the Arab Legion who was derided by Arab nationalists as a symbol of lingering British colonialism in Jordan. When Abdullah I was assassinated in 1951, Glubb and Prime Minister Tawfik Abu al-Huda's government discussed preventing Abdullah's son and heir apparent, Emir Talal, a sympathizer of the Free Officers, from being enthroned; Talal had been checked into a mental institution in Switzerland, but many Free Officers believed the British were fabricating Talal's mental illness to <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of Jordan. In response, Abu Nuwar sought to install Talal on the throne by force, and to that end he appealed for support from the Free Officers and sent Awni Hannun, a Jordanian military doctor, to bring Talal to Jordan. However, Hannun was forbidden from meeting Talal due to visitation restrictions and was dismissed by Glubb for alleged incitement against British interests. Nonetheless, Talal was enthroned, and Abu Nuwar subsequently urged him to dismiss Glubb. The latter feared Abu Nuwar's efforts posed a threat to British interests in Jordan, and thus directed Abu al-Huda's government to effectively exile Abu Nuwar from the country. The government complied, dispatching Abu Nuwar to Paris to serve as Jordan's military attaché in September 1952. Talal was later dethroned by parliamentary decision {{on the basis of his}} mental incapacity.|$|E

It is also said that the student is glad to get wounds in the face, because the scars they leave will show so well there; and it is also said that these face wounds are so prized that youths have even been known to pull them apart {{from time to time and}} put red wine in them to make them heal badly and leave as ugly a scar as possible. It does not look reasonable, but it is roundly asserted and maintained, nevertheless; I am sure of one thing--scars are plenty enough in Germany, among the young men; and very grim ones they are, too. They crisscross the face in angry red welts, and are permanent and ineffaceable.|$|R
