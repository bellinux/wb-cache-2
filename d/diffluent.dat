Environmental conditions surrounding the system also fluctuated during 25 January, as a result of Beni's position to the north of the strongly <b>diffluent</b> flow on the northern side of the upper-level ridge axis. As a result, the systems low level circulation center became partially exposed with deep convection located to the west of the system before Beni's low level circulation slipped back under the convection during 26 January, with spiral bands wrapping tightly around the centre. As a result, RSMC Nadi reported that the system had developed into a category 2 tropical cyclone during that day. Over the next two days conditions continued to fluctuate with shear playing a significant role in holding back further intensification of the system.

6000|$|The {{attempts}} {{to explain the}} nature of Life, which have fallen within my knowledge, presuppose the arbitrary division of all that surrounds us into things with life, and things without life—a division grounded on a mere assumption. At the best, it can be regarded only as a hasty deduction from the first superficial notices of the objects that surround us, sufficient, perhaps, {{for the purpose of}} ordinary discrimination, but far too indeterminate and <b>diffluent</b> to be taken unexamined by the philosophic inquirer. The positions of science must be tried in the jeweller’s scales, not like the mixed commodities of the market, on the weigh-bridge of common opinion and vulgar usage. Such, however, has been the procedure in the present instance, and the result has been answerable to the coarseness of the process. By a comprisal of the petitio principii with the argumentum in circulo,—in plain English, by an easy logic, which begins with begging the question, and then moving in a circle, comes round {{to the point where it}} began,—each of the two divisions has been made to define the other by a mere reassertion of their assumed contrariety. The physiologist has luminously explained Y plus X by informing us that it is a somewhat that is the antithesis of Y minus X; and if we ask, what then is Y-X? the answer is, the antithesis of Y+X,—a reciprocation of great service, that may remind us of the twin sisters in the fable of the Lamiæ, with but one eye between them both, which each borrowed from the other as either happened to want it; but with this additional disadvantage, that in the present case it is after all but an eye of glass. The definitions themselves will best illustrate our meaning. I will begin with that given by Bichat. “Life is the sum of all the functions by which death is resisted,” in which I have in vain endeavoured to discover any other meaning than that life consists in being able to live. This author, with a whimsical gravity, prefaces his definition with the remark, that the nature of life has hitherto been sought for in abstract considerations; as if it were possible that four more inveterate abstractions could be brought together in one sentence than are here assembled in the words, life, death, function, and resistance. Similar instances might be cited from Richerand and others. The word Life is translated into other more learned words; and this paraphrase of the term is substituted for the definition of the thing, and therefore (as is always the case in every real definition as contra-distinguished from a verbal definition,) for at least a partial solution of the fact. Such as these form the first class.—The second class takes some one particular function of Life common to all living objects,—nutrition, for instance; or, to adopt the phrase most in vogue at present, assimilation, for the purposes of reproduction and growth. Now this, it is evident, can be an appropriate definition only of the very lowest species, as of a Fungus or a Mollusca; and just as comprehensive an idea of the mystery of Life, as a Mollusca might give, can this definition afford. But this is not the only objection. For, first, it is not pretended that we begin with seeking for an organ evidently appropriated to nutrition, and then infer that the substance in which such an organ is found lives. On the contrary, in a number of cases among the obscurer animals and vegetables we infer the organ from the pre-established fact of its life. Secondly, it identifies the process itself with a certain range of its forms, those, namely, by which it is manifested in animals and vegetables. For this, too, no less than the former, presupposes the arbitrary division of all things into not living and lifeless, on which, as I before observed, all these definitions are grounded. But it is sorry logic to take the proof of an affirmative in one thing as the proof of the negative in another. All animals that have lungs breathe, but it would be a childish oversight to deduce the converse, viz. all animals that breathe have lungs. The theory in which the French chemists organized the discoveries of Black, Cavendish, Priestly, Scheele, and other English and German philosophers, is still, indeed, the reigning theory, but rather, it should seem, from the absence of a rival sufficiently popular to fill the throne in its stead, than from the continuance of an implicit belief in its own stability. We no longer at least cherish that intensity of faith which, before Davy commenced his brilliant career, had not only identified it with chemistry itself, but had substituted its nomenclature, even in common conversation, for the far more philosophic language which the human race had abstracted from the laboratory of Nature. I may venture to prophecy that no future Beddoes will make it the corival of the mathematical sciences in demonstrative evidence. I think it a matter of doubt whether, during the period of its supposed infallibility, physiology derived more benefit from the extension, or injury from the misdirection, of its views. Enough of the latter is fresh in recollection to make it but an equivocal compliment to a physiological position, that it must stand or fall with the corpuscular philosophy, as modified by the French theory of chemistry. Yet should it happen (and the event is not impossible, nor the supposition altogether absurd,) that more and more decisive facts should present themselves in confirmation of the metamorphosis of elements, the position that life consists in assimilation would either cease to be distinctive, or fall back into the former class as an identical proposition, namely, that Life, meaning by the word that sort of growth which takes place by means of a peculiar organization, consists in that sort of growth which is peculiar to organized life. Thirdly, the definition involves a still more egregious flaw in the reasoning, namely, that of cum hoc, ergo propter hoc (or the assumption of causation from mere coexistence); and this, too, in its very worst form. For it is not cum hoc solo, ergo propter hoc, which would in many cases supply a presumptive proof by induction, but cum hoc, et plurimis aliis, ergo propter hoc! Shell, of some kind or other, is common to the whole order of testacea, but it would be absurd to define the vis vitæ of testaceous animals as existing in the shell, though we know it to be the constant accompaniment, and have every reason to believe the constant effect, of the specific life that acts in those animals. Were we (argumenti [...] causá) to imagine shell coextensive with the organized creation, this would produce no abatement in the falsity of the reasoning. Nor does the flaw stop here; for a physiological, that is a real, definition, as distinguished from the verbal definitions of lexicography, must consist neither in any single property or function of the thing to be defined, nor yet in all collectively, which latter, indeed, would be a history, not a definition. It must consist, therefore, in the law of the thing, or in such an idea of it, as, being admitted, all the properties and functions are admitted by implication. It must likewise be so far causal, that a full insight having been obtained of the law, we derive from it a progressive insight into the necessity and generation of the phenomena of which it is the law. Suppose a disease in question, which appeared always accompanied with certain symptoms in certain stages, and with some one or more symptoms in all stages—say deranged digestion, capricious alternation of vivacity and languor, headache, dilated pupil, diminished sensibility to light, &c.—Neither the man who selected the one constant symptom, nor he who enumerated all the symptoms, would give the scientific definition talem scilicet, quali scientia fit vel datur, but the man who at once named and defined the disease hydrocephalus, producing pressure on the brain. For it is the essence of a scientific definition to be causative, not by introduction of imaginary somewhats, natural or supernatural under the name of causes, but by announcing the law of action in the particular case, in subordination to the common law of which all the phenomena are modifications or results.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} of peak {{intensity}} on August 16, Danielle was heading northward to north-northwestward because of a subtropical ridge. Shortly thereafter, southwesterly vertical shear began increasing, causing the hurricane to weaken. Mid-level flow associated with a <b>diffluent</b> trough caused Danielle to move northeastward on August 18. Later that day Danielle deteriorated to a Category 1 hurricane, hours before being downgraded to a tropical storm. On August 19, Danielle became nearly stationary and moved erratically while southwest of the Azores. Eventually, the storm curved west-southwestward and weakened to a tropical depression on August 20. About 24 hours later, Danielle degenerated into a remnant low pressure area. The remnant low moved westward {{and then to the}} north-northwest, before dissipating about 795 mi (1,280 km) west-southwest of the westernmost islands of the Azores.|$|E

After the system slowly drifted west-northwestward and then southwestward, the JMA began to issue warnings on the tropical depression at noon on January 16, albeit not expecting it to intensify into a tropical storm. Soon, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system, for the consolidating and slightly better defined low-level circulation center, favorable sea surface temperature, moderate vertical wind shear, as well as highly <b>diffluent</b> outflow.|$|E

50|$|On November 9, {{the system}} slowed down, {{as well as}} easterly {{vertical}} wind shear had become stronger over the system located southwest of Yangon, Burma, making it remain partially exposed and disorganised.

IMD upgraded it to a well-marked low-pressure area on November 11, yet a microwave imagery showed a broad low-level circulation centre with shallow convection as well as dry air beginning to wrap around the western quadrants. On November 13, IMD upgraded the system to a depression and designated it as BOB 05 at 00:00 UTC. As new formative bands developed along the northern and southeastern sectors, JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert again for the better-organised system at 13:00 UTC.

50|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Karl {{were from the}} {{interaction}} between a surface trough and westward-tracking tropical wave. The trough—an elongated area of low pressure—emerged from an area of disorganized monsoonal convection just north of South America over the Windward Islands in early September. A few days later, the wave, which had departed the coast of Africa on September 1, approached the area and merged with the trough by September 8 as it slowed. For several days, the resultant low-pressure system lingered toward the west-northwest over the Caribbean Sea, and provided with a <b>diffluent</b> environment aloft it generated disorganized patches of convection. Although the convection remained disassociated from the mean low feature, the overall wind circulation continued to become better defined at the surface. The development trend briefly became disrupted by September 13, however, with the surface low confirmed no longer to exist under the improving convective structure. Conditions remained favorable for reorganization, and a small but consolidated circulation center developed by 2100 UTC September 14. In real time, this marked the formation of Tropical Storm Karl when it was located about 270 mi (435 km) east of Chetumal, Mexico, though post-storm reanalysis revealed a tropical depression had in fact formed six hours earlier.|$|E

40|$|Using a global, one-layer {{shallow water}} model, the {{response}} of a westerly flow to a localized mountain is investigated. A steady, linear response at small mountain heights successively gives way first to a steady flow in which nonlinearities are important and then to unsteady, but periodic, flow at larger mountain heights. At first the unsteady behavior consists of a low-frequency oscillation of the entire Northern Hemisphere zonal flow. As the mountain height is increased further, however, the oscillatory behavior becomes localized in the <b>diffluent</b> jet exit region downstream of the mountain. The oscillation then {{takes the form of}} a relatively rapid vortex shedding event, followed by a gradual readjustment of the split jet structure in the <b>diffluent</b> region. Although relatively simple, the model exhibits a surprisingly high sensitivity to slight parameter changes. A linear stability analysis of the time-averaged flow is able to capture the transition from steady to time-dependent behavior, but fails to capture the transition between the two distinct regimes of time-dependent response. Moreover, the most unstable modes of the time-averaged flow are found to be stationary and fail to capture the salient features of the EOFs of the full time-dependent flow. These results therefore suggest that, even in the simplest cases, such as the one studied here, a linear analysis of the time-averaged flow can be highly inadequate in describing the full nonlinear behavior. 1...|$|E

40|$|Copyrighted by American Geophysical Union. We examine {{large-scale}} atmospheric behavior {{around the}} time of the spring and fall transitions in the coastal ocean off the west coast of North America. Records of adjusted sea level (ASL), coastal wind stress, sea level atmospheric pressure (SLP), and 500 -mbar heights for the years 1971 - 1975 and 1980 - 1983 are analyzed. The records cover periods of 91 days, centered on the dates of the spring and fall transitions as determined from coastal adjusted sea level data. Empirical orthogonal functions are obtained from the ASL, coastal wind stress, and SLP records. The two dominant modes of the ASL and coastal wind stress are similar {{around the time}}s of both the spring and fall transitions, and the time series for these modes are highly correlated with one another. Transitionlike behavior is evident in the time series of the first modes in both spring and fall, but the spring transition is more pronounced. Principal estimator patterns, formed from the dominant empirical orthogonal functions show the spatial patterns of SLP which force the ASL and coastal wind stress during the transitions. The SLP pattern which coincides with the spring transition is the formation of a high-pressure system centered at 45 °N and 140 °W along with the development of a low-pressure cell over the southwest continental United States. Inspection of the 500 -mbar height composites for 91 days surrounding the spring transition for the 9 years reveals the formation of a ridging pattern and <b>diffluent</b> flow over the western United States at the time of the transition; following the transition, the ridging relaxes but the <b>diffluent</b> flow over the continent remains for the duration of the 45 days examined here. The fall transition is characterized by a rise in ASL, particularly north of 40 °N, and a change from southward to northward wind stress. The SLP pattern which coincides with the fall transition involves the appearance of a low-pressure system off western North America centered at 50 °N and 140 °W, representing the passage of synoptic storms through the region. Prior to the fall transition, the 500 -mbar heights are somewhat <b>diffluent</b> and show a trough over the southwestern United States; after the transition the 500 -mbar flow over the northeast Pacific and North America is nearly zonal...|$|E

Large variability was also observed, especially with regard to the spatial dimensions of the surface and upper level systems, as well as variations in trough/ridge amplification and the evolution of upper level jet streak systems. The influence of transverse circulations associated with a confluent jet streak entrance region and the <b>diffluent</b> exit region of a jet streak/trough system on the production of snowfall is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|The easternmost {{extremity}} {{of the ice}} {{cap that}} developed in the Tasmanian Central Highlands {{during the time of}} most extensive Late Cainozoic glaciation lay on the doleritecapped Central Plateau east and north-east of Lake St Clair. During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the more restricted ice cover included a small discrete ice cap (probably less than 250 ± 300 m thick) that formed on the Central Plateau. The LGM ice limits on {{the southern part of the}} Central Plateau, including all five southern outlet valleys, are reported here. Earlier ice limits have been identifed in two of these valleys, but on the plateau proper earlier glacial deposits have been generally extensively reworked beyond the LGM limit, such that confirmation of a glacial origin for diamictons on slopes is difficult. South of the plateau, the oldest deposits fooring lower reaches of two outlet valleys indicate that ice flowed southwards directly from the plateau, but later deposits indicate <b>diffluent</b> flow from the Derwent Glacier...|$|E
40|$|A new genus of {{moderately}} halophilic, moderately halotolerant and moderately thermophilic cyanobacteria {{with very}} thin trichomes is described. The four strains {{included in this}} genus were isolated from benthic microbial mats in a man-made hypersaline pond. Trichomes were around 1 mum thick, with small constrictions at the cross-walls and <b>diffluent</b> colorless sheaths. Thylakoids were parallel to the cell wall, but thylakoids and nucleoid were often excentrically arranged within the cytoplasm {{with respect to the}} main trichome axis. Strains grew at between 3. 2 and 12 - 15 % (w/v) salinity with optima between 3. 2 and 12 %. They showed lower temperature limits around 20 degreesC and upper limits between 45 and 50 degreesC, with optima between 28 and 45 - 50 degreesC. Carotenoid and mycosporine amino-acid complements were identical among strains. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16 S rRNA gene sequence showed that all strains were closely related (99 % or higher similarity) and distantly related to other cyanobacteria (91 % or lower similarity). We propose the new genus and species Halomwicronema excentricum for these strains. The type strain is TFEP 1...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a special}} circumfluence in the center region of {{cross-section}} for a tri-screw extruder. To study {{the effect of the}} dynamic center region on the flow and mixing mechanism of the tri-screw extruder, 2 D finite element modeling was used to reduce the axial effects. Based on the particle tracking technology, the nonlinear dynamics of a typical particle motions in the center region was carried out and the mixing process in the tri-screw extruder was analyzed with Poincaré maps. Moreover, mixing evaluations of the tri-screw and twin-screw extruders were analyzed and compared. The results show that there are many multiple and fractional excitation frequencies in the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) spectrums, and it shows a chaotic motion in the center region. Poincaré section maps in the tri-screw show the better particles diffusive ability than those in the twin-screw extrude due to the excellent <b>diffluent</b> ability. Furthermore, the tri-screw extruder has the better dispersive, distributive mixing abilities and stretching mixing efficiency than the twin-screw extruder in the cross-section...|$|E
30|$|For doping experiments, vanadyl acetylacetonate (VO(C 5 H 7 O 2) 2) powder, {{which was}} {{dissolved}} in acetone, was used at first {{as the source}} of vanadium for dissolubility and less toxicity. However, we found that during the experiment, the color of the liquid mixture changed from light green to dark green, and we measured the weight of the residual vanadyl acetylacetonate only to find that it was almost {{the same as that of}} the powder prior to deposition. It clearly means that little powder was carried out into the chamber. Based on the above consideration, the vanadium source selected was vanadium oxytripropoxide (VO(OCH 2 CH 2 CH 3) 3), which was in a liquid state at room temperature and was <b>diffluent</b> in acetone. However, we also found that when the V/C ratio was 1 : 1, 000, it had already been saturated, so this ratio was the maximum in the experiment. At this time, the color of the liquid mixture was clarified as red-brown, and it never changed throughout the process, which could confirm that V was successfully being introduced into the chamber in sufficient amounts.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{case study}} {{is focused on the}} flash flood from 5 September 2007, a (235 mm of rain in 12 hours) {{occurred}} in the city of Tecuci (eastern Romania), causing fatalities and numerous properties damage. It was generated by a back-building mesoscale convective system developed in an area with strong warm advection at low levels and <b>diffluent</b> southerly flow at upper levels. Analyses of conventional weather station, radar and high resolution visible satellite imagery, together with ALADIN model analysis, are used to describe the synoptic and mesoscale weather patterns associated with the flash flood. Surface analysis and high resolution visible satellite imagery identified a convergence line that acted to focus thunderstorm development in a limited area. Radar reflectivity indicated that rapid cell generation occurred where the convergent line existed, just north of Tecuci. A strong southerly low level jet focused the most active convection over the same area during several hours. The aim {{of this paper is to}} identify the different mesoscale processes leading to continuous regeneration of convection in the same area that contributes to the heavy rain accumulation in a short period of time in the small watershed located in the eastern part of Romania. Key words: heavy rain, mesoscale convective system, flash flood. 1...|$|E
40|$|Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) imagery from 3 May 1999 is examined. Synoptic-scale {{water vapor}} imagery shows a {{deepening}} low-amplitude upper-level trough over the western United States on 3 May, which develops a negative tilt as a jet streak digs south-southeastward over California. The imagery also shows a second jet streak propagating rapidly from Baja California {{to the southern}} Great Plains. This feature intensifies as it propagates into the <b>diffluent</b> region {{on the east side}} of the trough. Thunderstorms initiate as this jet streak moves over western Oklahoma during the late afternoon. GOES visible imagery shows a north–south cloud boundary over southwestern Oklahoma on 3 May. To the west of this boundary, cumulus cloudiness dominates. To the east, stratocumulus and wave (billow) clouds characterize the low-level cloud field. As the jet streak and associated cirrus propagate over northern Texas, towering cumulus clouds develop and then dissipate. As the cirrus clouds propagate over western Oklahoma, towering cumulus clouds develop and persist. This note discusses important features observed in GOES imagery as it pertains to convective morphology. These features were not adequately resolved by the numerical models but were important in the forecast. The benefits of using satellite imagery in combination with model output and other data are discussed. 1...|$|E
40|$|The broad {{topographic}} {{framework and}} erosion surface morphology of west central Tasmania predates the early Pleistocene. The valley systems, however, have been emphasised by glacial erosion which {{has played a}} major role in shaping the detailed geomorphology of the mountains. Part of an extensive ice cap that developed in the Tasmanian Central Highlands during the late Cainozoic discharged southwards via a major outlet glacier that occupied the valley of the Derwent River. The heart of the Central Tasmanian ice cap probably lay west of the Du Cane Range. When the ice cover was most extensive the Derwent Glacier was up to 500 metres thick. It may have extended to as low as 230 metres above sea level, 70 kilometres downstream from its source in the cirques of the Du Cane Range. Two <b>diffluent</b> lobes of this glacier spread eastwards to merge with other glaciers in the Nive Valley. Other <b>diffluent</b> lobes extended southwards into the upper Gordon Valley, and westwards into the upper Franklin and Alma valleys. At the maximum phase the Franklin and Alma glaciers were confluent around Mt. Alma, near the present junction of the Collingwood and Franklin rivers. The more westerly glaciers displayed the highest rates of mass throughput hence glacial landforms are more abundant and better developed in the west. Analysis of the post-depositional modification of the glacial landforms and sediments suggests that at least three glaciations took place. The first glaciation was probably early Pleistocene or late Pliocene in age while the most recent and smallest occurred during the late Last Glacial Stage. Glaciation would have demanded colder temperatures and an increased solid precipitation budget, but no major shift in the direction of snow bearing winds is neccessitated. At no stage was the mean annual air temperature likely to have been more than 9 ° C less than present. The glaciations were probably broadly contemporaneous with those at similar southern latitudes in Andean Patagonia and South Island New Zealand. Like the glaciers of those areas the ice masses of west central Tasmania were mainly of temperate maritime character. The glaciations were accompanied by periglacial activity beyond the limits of the ice. The development of rock glaciers suggests that localised areas of permafrost existed during the Last Glaciation. The glacial oversteepening has greatly facilitated slope retreat in areas of high structural anisotropy, particularly under periglacial conditions. Interglacial weathering and erosion was comparatively innocuous, although the presence of a substantial vegetation cover seems to have been critical to the maintenance of slope stabilty, particularly in steeper and more elevated terrain. The geomorphic evidence does not demand any climate deterioration during the Holocene, The most active geomorphological agent of the Holocene interglacial is humankind. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{perturbation}} {{potential vorticity}} (PV) theory is developed {{to investigate the}} three-dimensional, time-depen-dent, linear geostrophic adjustment of a stably stratified, Boussinesq atmosphere that is disturbed from (i) quiescent equilibrium due to a localized, unbalanced, zonal wind anomaly and (ii) geostrophic equilibrium of the uniform zonal flow due to an isolated couplet of acceleration–deceleration forcing. This prescribed zonal momentum forcing propagates downstream at a speed c that {{is less than the}} basic-state zonal flow speed U and physically represents the parameterized effects of nonlinear inertial advection. Transient, dispersive inertia–gravity waves in all fields are essentially removed during the early stage of the response associated with the initial value problem. The steady-state equilibrium that conserves the initial per-turbation PV is a localized, geostrophic zonal jet with meridionally confluent (<b>diffluent)</b> flow in its entrance (exit) region. This jet is supported by a couplet of perturbation low and high pressure north and south of the zonal jet core, respectively. There exist no steady-state ageostrophic winds and vertical motions once balanced equilibrium is reached. This long-term asymptotic response characterizes a localized linear thermal wind balance among the baroclinic perturbations that will not be preserved in the nonlinear initial value problem. The forced response for a uniform, stably stratified, zonal flow whose Rossby number is RoU 5 (U 2 c) / 2 a...|$|E
40|$|On 13 October 2001, a mini-tornado {{outbreak}} occurred {{along the}} central Gulf Coast {{over a small}} area (9 tornadoes per ~ 3200 mi 2). This event {{was part of a}} larger scale severe weather outbreak that occurred over the preceding five days and extended from Nebraska to Georgia. The number of tornadoes (five F 0 s, two F 1 s, one F 2 and an F 3) accounts for 12. 6 % of all reported Baldwin County (71) tornadoes from 1950 - 2001. Single Doppler radar revealed the existence of 52 operator-defined shallow mesocyclones (rotation depths generally < 1. 5 km). Synoptically, the event was characterized by a notable <b>diffluent</b> upper tropospheric wind flow pattern, a broad and strengthening low-level jet (40 - 60 kt) and the propagation of an upper level jet streak (100 - 110 kt) atop a strengthening surface front during a period of peak solar insolation. The presence of increased 0 - 3 km SBCAPE (~ 289 J kg- 1) at updraft low-levels (0 - 3 km) along with relatively strong ambient 0 - 2 km vertical wind shear likely aided the development of additional storm-scale dynamical lifting forces which potentially set this event apart from past similar, but non-tornadic events. In the updraft low-levels, composite mesocyclone radial Vr-shear values were observed to nearly double from 0. 020 s- 1 to 0. 038...|$|E
