5|$|In 2005, 42% of all {{households}} and 76% of {{households in the}} top quintile <b>had</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> more income earners. As a result, there was a considerable discrepancy between household and personal income. Recent studies, {{such as the one}} conducted by Harvard professor Elizabeth Warren, have shown that the average American household needs two incomes in order to live what is commonly perceived as a middle-class lifestyle.|$|E

5|$|Aberdaron had a {{population}} of 1,019 in 2001, of which 20.6 per cent were below the age of 16, and 18.7 per cent were over 64years of age. Owner occupiers inhabited 53.7 per cent of the dwellings; and 21.7 per cent were rented; 19.6 per cent were holiday homes. Central heating was installed in 62.8 per cent of dwellings; but 2.4 per cent were without sole use of a bath, shower or toilet. The proportion of households without use of a vehicle was 14.3 per cent; but 40.9 per cent <b>had</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> more.

5|$|He {{imagined}} {{it as an}} homage to the 1960s comic books and spy films from his boyhood and he initially tried to develop it as a 2D cel animation. When The Iron Giant became a box office bomb, he reconnected with old friend John Lasseter at Pixar in March 2000 and pitched his story idea to him. Bird and Lasseter knew each other from their college years at CalArts in the 1970s. Lasseter was sold on the idea and convinced Bird to come to Pixar, where the film would be done in computer animation. The studio announced a multi-film contract with Bird on May 4, 2000, breaking Pixar's mold of having directors who had all risen through the ranks. The Incredibles was written and directed solely by Brad Bird, a departure from previous Pixar productions which typically <b>had</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> three directors and as many screenwriters. In addition, {{it would be the}} company's first film in which all characters are human.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, English ornithologist Daniel T. Holyoak {{described}} {{some small}} parrot bones {{that he had}} discovered among a collection of broad-billed parrot (Lophopsittacus mauritianus) subfossils in the Zoology Museum of Cambridge University. These remains had been collected by Louis Etienne Thirioux in the early 20th century, who had found them in a cave on Le Pouce mountain, on the Mascarene island of Mauritius. They {{were placed in the}} zoology museum by 1908. Apart from their size and robustness, Holyoak did not find the bones to be distinct from those of the Mascarene parrot genera Lophopsittacus, Mascarinus (the Mascarene parrot), Necropsittacus (the Rodrigues parrot), and Psittacula (which <b>had</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> three other species inhabiting the Mascarene islands). Because of their similarities, Holyoak considered all these genera to be closely related.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} of his performance during the game, Virginia Tech wide receiver Bryan Still was named the game's most valuable player. He caught six passes for 119 yards and one touchdown. He also returned a punt for 60 yards and a touchdown, and his 27-yard reception {{in the third quarter}} set up Tech's third touchdown two plays later. Still's punt return was the longest in Virginia Tech bowl-game history to that point and was surpassed in the 2008 Orange Bowl when Justin Harper returned a punt 84 yards for a touchdown. Tech tight end Bryan Jennings was the Hokies' second-leading receiver; he finished the game with six catches for 77 yards. Four other players <b>had</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> fewer receptions.|$|E

Those with an NVQ level 1 comprise 8.0% of the population while 15.2% have a level 2 NVQ, a City and Guilds craft certificate, BTEC or general diploma. Just over 20% of residents <b>had</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> more A-levels, four or more AS-Levels or an advanced diploma while 15.8% possessed a degree, such as a BA or BSc or a higher degree such as an MA or PhD.

5|$|In 2008, an {{estimated}} 140,000 married fathers {{worked in the}} home as their children's primary caregivers while their wives worked outside the home {{to provide for the}} family. This number is less than the previous two years according to the US Census Bureau. In 2007, stay-at-home dads made up approximately 2.7% of the nation's stay-at-home parents. This is triple the percentage from 1997, and has been consistently higher each year since 2005. In 2006, stay-at-home dads were caring for approximately 245,000 children; 63% of stay-at-home dads <b>had</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> more children. These statistics only account for married stay-at-home dads; there are other children being cared for by single fathers or gay couples. Also, it is difficult to ascertain how many of these stay-at-home dads have accepted the role voluntarily, and how many have been forced into it by the economic crisis of the late 2000s and early 2010s during which a great number of mostly-male blue-collar industries suffered significant losses and many previously employed men entered periods of prolonged unemployment.|$|E
5|$|Rich {{families}} from Rome usually <b>had</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> more houses, a townhouse (domus, plural domūs) {{and at least}} one luxury home (villa) outside the city. The domus was a privately owned single-family house, and might be furnished with a private bath (balneum), {{but it was not a}} place to retreat from public life. Although some neighbourhoods of Rome show a higher concentration of well-to-do houses, the rich did not live in segregated enclaves. Their houses were meant to be visible and accessible. The atrium served as a reception hall in which the paterfamilias (head of household) met with clients every morning, from wealthy friends to poorer dependents who received charity. It was also a centre of family religious rites, containing a shrine and the images of family ancestors. The houses were located on busy public roads, and ground-level spaces facing the street were often rented out as shops (tabernae). In addition to a kitchen garden—windowboxes might substitute in the insulae—townhouses typically enclosed a peristyle garden that brought a tract of nature, made orderly, within walls.|$|E
