Traveling from Chang'an (now Xi'an), General Huo and his soldiers traveled for several days on end before arriving {{at the foot of}} the Gaolan Mountain. Wearied and out of water, the army began to search for water. When water could be found nowhere, General Huo lashed his horsewhip five times into the ground. Such was the <b>force</b> <b>in</b> his <b>blows</b> <b>that</b> immediately five springs began spouting water. From that day onward place came to be known as the Five Springs Mountain.|$|R
