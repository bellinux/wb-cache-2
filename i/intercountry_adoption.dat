Known child adoptions (adoption by relatives, stepparents or carers) are a form of local adoptions.|$|R

40|$|This Facts Sheet {{provides}} {{a summary of}} the ways in which adoption currently operates, past adoption practices, and the potential impacts adoption has on those involved. There are three types of adoption currently operating in Australia: <b>Intercountry</b> <b>adoptions</b> are of children from other countries who are usually unknown to the adoptive parent(s). Since 1999 - 2000, most adoptions in Australia have been <b>intercountry</b> <b>adoptions.</b> In 2010 - 11, there were 215, representing 56 % of all adoptions. Local adoptions are those of children born or permanently residing in Australia, but who generally have had no previous contact or relationship with the adoptive parents. In 2010 - 11, there were 45 local adoptions, representing 12 % of all adoptions. "Known" child adoptions are of children born or permanently residing in Australia who have a pre-existing relationship with the adoptive parent(s), such as step-parents, other relatives and carers. In 2010 - 11, there were 124 "known" child adoptions, representing 32 % of all adoptions. (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare [AIHW], 2012) Despite the large growth in the number of Australian children in out-of-home care over the last two decades, adoption of these children is rare. This is because there is a strong push for them to be restored to or maintain active contact with their parents. In addition, most jurisdictions have the capacity to: (a) make permanent care orders (which provide security of placement with a foster/kinship carer); and/or (b) have policies relating to the creation of permanency plans 1 when there is no foreseeable likelihood of children being able to safely return to the care of their parents. Unlike adoption, these foster/kinship care arrangements do not formally extend past a child turning 18 years of age...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the latest data on adoptions by Australian families, and highlights important national trends in adoptions {{over the last}} few decades. Data for this report were obtained from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) Adoptions Australia data collection. This data collection is a record of all finalised adoptions in Australia since 1990 – 91, collected from each state and territory department responsible for adoption. Main findings: Since the early 1970 s, there has been a 21 –fold {{decrease in the number of}} adoptions in Australia— from 8, 542 in 1972 – 73 to 412 adoptions in 2009 – 10. However, the total number of adoptions has remained relatively stable since the late- 1990 s, at around 400 to 600 children per year. The overall decline in adoptions can be attributed to a fall in the number of Australian children adopted (including local and ‘known’ child <b>adoptions).</b> In contrast, <b>intercountry</b> <b>adoptions</b> have increased overall in the last 25 years, and have emerged as the dominant category of adoptions— representing 54 % of all adoptions in 2009 – 10, compared with 10 % in 1984 – 85. In 2009 – 10 : There were 412 adoptions in Australia (1. 9 per 100, 000 population) —the lowest number of adoptions recorded since reporting commenced, and a 7 % decline from the previous year. Of these, 54 % were intercountry, 15 % were local and 31 % were ‘known’ child adoptions (see Glossary for definitions). The majority of intercountry adoptees came from the Asian region (82 %). The three most common countries of origin in Asia were the Philippines (22 %), China (14 %) and South Korea (14 %). Ethiopia was the most common country of origin outside the Asian region (15 %). Overall, 65 % of adopted children were aged under 5 years. In local and <b>intercountry</b> <b>adoptions,</b> nearly all children were under 5 years (100 % and 86 %, respectively). Of the children in local and <b>intercountry</b> <b>adoptions,</b> 39 % and 63 % respectively had adoptive parents aged 40 years and over. The majority of local and intercountry adoptees were adopted into families with no other children (75 % and 58 %, respectively). Nine in ten (92 %) local adoptions could be considered ‘open’—that is, all parties were open to freely discussing the adoption within their families, and were happy to allow contact to occur between families. The remaining 8 % were adoptions where birth parents had requested no contact or information between them and the adopting family. Three Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children were adopted in 2009 – 10, with a total of 63 Indigenous children being adopted over the last 15 years. Two-thirds (67 %) of ‘known’ child adoptions were of children were aged 10 years and over. For ‘known’ child adoptions, 57 % of adoptions were by step-parents and a further 41 % were by carers...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{prevalence}} of emotional and behavioural problems in adolescent adoptees from Indonesia living in South Australian families with that of adolescents living {{in the community and}} those referred to mental health clinics in South Australia. METHOD: Thirty-four Indonesian adoptees completed the Youth Self-Report and their adoptive mothers completed the Child Behaviour Checklist. The results on these instruments were compared with the scores of a community sample and a mental health clinic population. RESULTS: There was a striking similarity between scores on the Youth Self-Report and the Child Behaviour Checklist instruments for the adoption and community groups. Both these groups had significantly fewer problems than adolescents referred to mental health clinics.

40|$|One of {{the fastest}} growing ethnic populations in many Western {{societies}} is that of people of mixed descent. However, when talking about multicultural societies or 'mixed race', the discussion usually focuses on people of black and white heritage. The contributors to this collection rectify this with a broad and pluralistic approach to the experiences of 'mixed race' people in Britain and the USA. The contributors argue that people of mixed descent reveal the arbitrary and contested logic of categorisation underpinning racial divisions. Falling outside the prevailing definitions of racialised identities, their histories and experiences illuminate the complexities of identity formation in the contemporary multicultural context. The authors examine a range of issues. These include gender; transracial and <b>intercountry</b> <b>adoptions</b> in Britain and the US; interracial partnering and marriage; 'mixed race' and family in the English-African diaspora; theorising of 'mixed race' that transcends the black/white binary and includes explorations of 'mixtures' among non-white minority groups; and the social and political evolution of multiracial panethnicity...|$|R
