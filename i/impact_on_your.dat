5000|$|Édouard Gruner, mining {{engineer}} and vice-president of the Comité central des houillères, {{was an active}} member of the Société d'économie sociale and secretary-treasurer of the Musée social.He had already introduced Robert Pinot to the metallurgy manufacturers who were looking for a leader for their trade association, and did the same for de Rousiers by putting him in contact with the shipbuilders, who wanted to found a professional association.De Rousiers was engaged in 1903 by André Lebon, former minister of Commerce and then of the Colonies, and first president of the Comité central des armateurs de France (CCAF: Central Committee of French Shipowners).De Rousiers was secretary-general and vice-president-delegate of the committee.He now had stable employment that allowed him to rebuild his family home in Rhus and provide education to his five children.The CCAF was an owners' association typical of the time with the purpose of studying and defending the common interests of the shipowners.Within a year it represented 98% of the industry.De Rousiers quickly established a service to gather French and foreign information, which he described in March 1910, The information service of the Shipowners' Committee is not conceived in an academic spirit but in a spirit of practical use. We do not intend to constitute a compendium of jurisprudence or a compendium of statistics; We strive to point out to you all that seems likely to have an <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> industry, anything that threatens your general interests, anything that is of a nature to serve them. The information service and a legal section both were frequently consulted by the shipowners.With his considerable intellectual authority, de Rousiers was an effective defender of the interests of the shipowners and contributed to dscussions on legislative project. At times he was criticized for being too effective in his lobbying.During World War I (1914-18) there was an enforced truce between the shipowners and the labor unions, with the state as mediator.As soon as the Armistice was declared the shipowners, led by the Committee, reasserted their independence in negotiating wages.De Rousiers justified this position, Conditions vary according to the region; Working conditions vary according to traffic and categories of vessels. Remuneration also depends on the possibilities of each company. How could it be conceived that, in the midst of a crisis, a professional trade union would be forced, by submitting to such an arbitration procedure, to impose new burdens on all its members which might exceed the limit of what some can bear? It would be a lack of clairvoyance.|$|E
40|$|Introduction The marking {{criteria}} for the dissertation is likely to carry different weightings for the grading of this chapter in your dissertation thesis, to that of your research proposal (See Feather, 2010, on How to Write an Undergraduate Marketing Dissertation Proposal). For example, here at The Business School at the University of Huddersfield, there is more weighting given to the methodology in the proposal, than in the main disseration. The reasoning behind this, is that, {{if you can get}} it right for the proposal, it should be straight forward when it comes to the research methodology chapter in the thesis, as you may be just changing it a little depending upon what has <b>impacted</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> research whilst you were undertaking the primary data collection, and writing up the various chapters of your thesis. Therefore, you may be in a position where you are simply tightening up your writing in line with your supervisor’s comments, the feedback you received on this section in your proposal, and changing the pre-tense to the past-tense. Having said this, in all my years of experience supervising and grading students’ work, this chapter appears to be the weak link in the chain of writing for the undergraduate dissertation. Mainly, because it may be the first time that students have been introduced to such concepts of phenomenology, interpretivism, epistimology, feminism, action reseach, positivsim and so on. These are very scary words to some students (Quinlan, 2011), but you should not be put off by these words, as it is these words, and the knowledge acquired by reading, understanding and applying these words that will make your work stand out, and possibly gain you those extra marks you feel you may need in order to meet your desired objective. That is, in obtaining a good grade for your dissertation that counts towards your degree classification. Some dissertations (at some institutions), are 40 credit modules, and therefore, are equivalent to two 20 credit modules. So it is important that you get this part right, as it is your plan of action, or, how you intend to undertake (pre-tense for the proposal), or have taken (past-tense for the dissertation), for your chosen research subject...|$|R

40|$|If {{you are a}} {{beef cattle}} {{producer}} that depends on rain fed pasture then you know how costly a severe drought can be. Whatever actions are taken to mitigate drought, there is always an associated cost whether it be physical or psychological. From an economic perspective, drought mitigation is managed from two main objectives – demand management and/or supply management. Demand management options include decreasing the demand for feed, such as selling livestock, weaning calves early and moving them to a dry lot or sale and/or reducing the grazing time in pastures. Supply management includes options that increase the supply of forage and/or water, which includes well creation, trucking water to livestock, renting additional pasture area, grazing alternative forages such as crop residue and trucking livestock further distances. With rare exception, all of these options incur cost either by increasing expenses or decreasing future revenues. While {{it may not be}} possible to avoid costs as the result of drought, it is possible to prepare and limit them. The more prepared you are the more options you will have to mitigate drought conditions, hopefully leading to smaller <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> you, <b>your</b> family and your livelihood. In addition to being prepared with alternative mitigation strategies, timeliness in implementing those plans is critical in having a successful drought plan. The fact is, drought is going to occur naturally and is a part of doing business. Make it a part of your overall business plan and something that is used with your annual management strategy...|$|R
