In this study we investigated the hypothesis that migration processes determine the observable spatio-temporal synchrony in population dynamics of <b>larch</b> bud <b>moth</b> at the valley scale. We explored the effect of orography at a finer resolution on modelled potential dispersal ranges of <b>larch</b> bud <b>moth</b> by incorporating a high resolution GIS based migration model with a coarse resolution population dynamics simulation model. Modelled migration paths were affected considerably by inclusion of orography compared to predecessor models that ignored orographical effects.

40|$|Spatio-temporal {{patterns}} of cyclic <b>larch</b> bud <b>moth</b> population densities, for instance synchrony (valley scale) and travelling waves (Alpine arc scale), {{have been observed}} at different scales and maybe related to distinct causes. In this study, quantification of population data through cross-correlation analysis and spectral analysis revealed that <b>larch</b> bud <b>moth</b> population cycles at the valley scale could {{be considered to be}} in close synchrony with one another. At the Alpine arc scale the presence of travelling waves could generally be confirmed. These results have implications for the understanding of the causal mechanisms behind the observed spatio-temporal patterns, suggesting that at the valley scale synchrony depends not only on distances between subpopulations, but is also affected by environmental/habitat characteristics that vary in space. At the Alpine scale, distance between populations is of greater importance in shaping spatio-temporal patterns than at the valley scale...|$|R
40|$|Ideally {{studies on}} the {{population}} dynamics of organisms should be holistic, general, precise, and realistic (64). Much too often, however, support for research on forest pests approximates {{the curve of the}} gradations in time and space, resulting in periodic gathering of bits and pieces of information that differ little from that gathered earlier or elsewhere (68). Therefore {{it is not surprising that}} lack of compre hensive, quantitative information on many generations of a field population has handicapped the progress of theoretical thinking on the dynamics of populations, which badly needs "more light and less heat " (86). It has been proposed that research efforts should be coordinated internationally on a few model insects in order to cope with complexity and diversity of population dynamics at a high level of efficiency (25). We consider that the <b>larch</b> bud <b>moth,</b> Zeiraphera diniana, would meet the criteria for being such a model insect (18). The coincidence of large-scale insect outbreaks, the availability of effective insecti cides, and economic expansion of industry and tourism after World War II pro moted several extensive control actions against such forest pests as the spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana, in eastern Canada and the <b>larch</b> bud <b>moth,</b> Z. diniana, in Switzerland. Public demand to protect the subalpine larch forests in the recreation area of the Engadine (Switzerland) against the recurring defoliation by the <b>larch</b> bud <b>moth</b> triggered the present research phase. This article is the first attempt to publish the results of the research period (1949 - 1975) comprehensively. In addition, information concerning previous outbreaks of Z. diniana is reviewed on a worldwide base...|$|R
40|$|In current {{publication}} {{analyses of}} time series of <b>larch</b> bud <b>moth</b> (Zeiraphera diniana Gn.) dynamics are considered. For fitting of time series Moran - Ricker model with time lags was used. Estimations of model parameters {{were provided with}} non-traditional approach: for every considered case feasible sets of points in space of model parameters were determined where selected statistical criterions give required results for deviations between theoretical (model) and empirical datasets. In all considered situations obtained results were compared with other results obtained with least squared method. It was obtained that Moran - Ricker model without time lag and with time lag in one year is not suitable for fitting of time series. Best correspondences on quantitative and qualitative levels between model trajectories and empirical dataset were found for cases with time lag in 3 years. ...|$|R
40|$|In current {{publication}} {{within the}} framework of method of extreme points various characteristics of feasible sets are applied for forecast of population dynamics. Following characteristics were used: maximum, minimum and average values for all trajectories with parameters belonging to feasible set, trajectory with best characteristics for Kolmogorov - Smirnov criterion, and trajectory with lowest value of sum of squared deviations between theoretical and empirical values. Analyses were provided for <b>larch</b> bud <b>moth</b> population (Zeiraphera diniana Gn.) time series (GPDD 1407; sample size is 38) and for Moran - Ricker model. Time series was divided onto two parts: for first part (first 21 values or more) feasible sets were determined and for tails of time series pointed out characteristics were applied. Forecasting properties of used characteristics are under discussion. ...|$|R
40|$|Temporal {{dynamics}} of the <b>larch</b> bud <b>moth</b> (lbm), a cyclic forest defoliator in the European Alps, have been extensively researched and modelled. This study aims for the spatio-temporal modelling of lbm defoliation as related to landscape heterogeneity across a hierarchy of scales. A spatio-temporal lbm model has been constructed, which combines local population dynamics with moth migration at {{the scale of the}} Alps (Fischlin, 1983). The model matched traveling waves of population data from the Alps while assuming host plant-lbm interactions. This model indicated that spatial arrangement of valleys may significantly affect synchronisation among local populations. Secondly, in a recent paper, Bj√∏rnstad et al. (2002) have proposed an alternative explanation for the same phenomenon, however assuming lbm-parasitoid interactions and requiring a currently hypothetical gradient of landscape heterogeneity. Thirdly, landscape metrics and geostatistics (variograms, kriging) have been successfully applied to model defoliation patterns and outbreak durations for other defoliators, and related these to structural properties of the landscape. Our study will employ such methods to quantify the relationship between lbm and landscape heterogeneity whil...|$|R
40|$|The European larch (Larix decidua Mill.) is a pioneer, very long-lived, fast-growing {{coniferous}} tree, {{which occurs}} in the central and eastern mountains of Europe, forming open forests or pasture woods at the upper tree limits. Larch is the only deciduous conifer in Europe as an adaptation to continental alpine climates. In fact, {{it is able to}} tolerate very cold temperatures during winter and, by losing its needles, avoids foliage desiccation. It is a transitional species, colonising open terrain after natural disturbances. It forms pure stands but more often it is found with other alpine tree species, which tend to replace it if no other disturbances occur. Thanks to its adaptability and the durability of its wood, the European larch represents an important silvicultural tree species in the alpine regions, planted even outside its natural ranges. Its wood is largely used for carpentry, furniture and pulp for paper. In lower altitudes or with high precipitation rates, larch is more susceptible to fungal diseases. Outbreaks of insect defoliators, principally caused by the <b>larch</b> bud <b>moth</b> (Zeiraphera diniana), can limit tree development, with economic losses in plantations, but they rarely lead to the death of the trees...|$|R
40|$|Forests {{and climate}} change- lessons from insects Battisti A* Abstract: The climate change may {{indirectly}} affects the forest ecosystems {{through the activity}} of phytophagous insects. The climate change has been claimed to be responsible of the range expansion northward and upward of several insect species of northern temperate forests, {{as well as of}} changes in the seasonal phenology. Several papers have dealt with the prediction of the most likely consequences of the climate change on the phytophagous insects, including {{some of the most important}} forest pests. Increased levels of CO 2 in the atmosphere involve an increase of the C/N balance of the plant tissues, which in turn results in a lower food quality for many defoliating insects. Some insects respond by increasing the level of leaf consumption and consequently the damage to the tree, whereas others show higher mortality and lower performance. The level of plant chemical defences may also be affected by a change of CO 2. The temperature is affecting either the survival of the insects which are active during the cold period, such as the pine processionary moth, or the synchronization mechanism between the host and the herbivores, as in the case of the <b>larch</b> bud <b>moth.</b> An increase of temperature may alter the mechanism by which the insects adjust their cycles to the local climate (diapause), resulting in faster development and higher feeding rate, as in the case of the spruce web-spinning sawfly outbreaks in the Southern Alps...|$|R

40|$|Spatial synchrony, that is, {{correlated}} population fluctuation over wide geographical areas, {{has been}} detected in diverse taxa and over various geographical scales. The most commonly suggested mechanisms to explain spatial synchrony include dispersal and regional stochasticity (i. e., "the Moran effect"). We analyzed landscape-scale historical outbreak data for six forest insect species: spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana), {{western spruce budworm}} (C. occidentalis), <b>larch</b> bud <b>moth</b> (Zeiraphera diniana), forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria), mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae), and gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar). We used a recently developed statistical method (the nonparametric covariance function) for quantifying the magnitude and spatial range of synchrony in both outbreak and corresponding weather data. The varying dispersal capabilities of the species enabled us to speculate on {{the relative importance of}} dispersal vs. the Moran effect as potential mechanisms behind the observed patterns. Our results indicated that spatial synchrony was not directly associated with dispersal capabilities at the spatial scales considered. In contrast, the spatial correlation in weather variables was high enough to account for the levels of synchrony observed in the outbreak data. Therefore, the Moran effect appeared to be the more dominant process affecting the spatial dynamics of these species at the landscape scale. In general, however, the synchrony in outbreaks declined more steeply with geographical distance than the correlation in the weather variables - breaking with the predictions of Moran's theorem. A more detailed analysis of gypsy moth outbreak data showed that local dynamics varied considerably in a spatially dependent manner. The existence of such [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The <b>larch</b> bud <b>moth</b> (LBM) Zeiraphera diniana Guen√©e causes {{defoliation}} on larch in the Alps at 8 - to 10 -year intervals, {{after which}} populations crash. There are two LBM host races, one on larch {{and the other}} on cembran pine. These host races are morphologically indistinguishable as adults but they differ genetically in larval color types. Furthermore, females of each host race produce distinct pheromone blends and show oviposition preferences for their respective hosts. It is not clear to what extent host choice contributes to assortative mating in the LBM. Here, we compare the olfactory sensitivities of the two host races to the odors of fresh foliage of the host plants using the electroantennogram (EAG) technique, and the responses of the two host races to volatiles collected from the two host plants as analyzed by gas-chromatography-linked antennographic detection (GC-EAD). Both sexes of the larch and cembran host races show the same EAG responses to vapors of fresh larch and cembran pine foliage. Fifteen plant volatiles identified as chemostimuli by GC-EAD from larch and cembran pine odors elicited the same antennogram responses from the two host races. However, the GC-EAD analyses indicate that the number and quantity of chemostimuli emanating from each host plant is different. It is, therefore, most probably the array of olfactory receptors responding to the bouquet of volatiles unique to each host plant that underlies the host preferences of the two races. What remains open {{is the extent to which}} the similarity of the olfactory systems may contribute to cross-attraction. The fact that LBM individuals with intermediate characteristics between the two host races exist, suggests that olfactory perception does not hinder gene flow and contributes to sustained genetic diversity within the species Z. diniana...|$|R
40|$|In current publication, a non¬≠traditional {{approach}} to estimation of parameters of ecological models is considered. Within {{the framework of}} this approach {{it is not necessary}} to construct loss¬≠function or likelihood function. The basic idea of method is as follows: first of all, basic requirements to model and to deviate between theoretical (model) and empirical datasets must be formulated. After that, respective statistical criteria must be selected, and with the help of these statistical criteria, a feasible set in space of model parameters must be determined (where all statistical criterions demonstrate required results). Within the limits of this feasible set must be found elements with strongest properties. These elements can be used as estimations of model parameters. Constructions of feasible sets for Moran ‚Äì Ricker model with and without time lag and ELP¬≠model were demonstrated on examples of <b>larch</b> bud <b>moth</b> (Zeiraphera diniana Gn.) and pine looper moth (Bupalus piniarius L.) time series. Results of approximation are discussed. For a time series of population dynamics of larch budworm it was found that feasible sets are not empty for the model Moran ‚Äì Ricker without delay and with delay of one year. At the same time, the analysis of properties of elements of admissible sets showed that among them there are no properties that match the prevailing biological understanding of the dynamics of the Zeiraphera diniana Gn. The resulting estimation allowed taking into account the delay of one year to receive treatment with a cycle length of 18 with two maxima. However, almost all statistical tests gave negative results. These results indicate that the delay in the self¬≠regulation mechanisms of action of more than one year. Given way to simultaneously estimate the parameters of the population dynamics model of pine looper for related time series.
