5|$|Strong {{possessed the}} ability to find good holes on land that seemed far too severe for golf and had the gumption to build very bold and {{distinctive}} holes that are open to criticism but clearly are more thought provoking and <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> most other architect's work. The green slopes that he envisioned and built on his courses were the single best defense of a hole.|$|E
5|$|Planet Moon Studios' {{blending}} of two genres in Giants {{has earned the}} acclaim of reviewers. Game Revolution and GameSpot found the simplified real-time strategy task of resource gathering in Giants more <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> tedious, and Troy Dunniway, Microsoft's Head of Game Design in 2002, commented that the real-time strategy elements enhanced the game's shooter aspect rather than making it a hybrid of two genres. Sci Fi Weekly was impressed that both styles of play never interfered with each other, which was complemented by the unique gameplay of each race. The Entertainment Depot, however, found the base building in several missions tedious; they said the player had to rebuild the base several times due to being forced to leave the base defenseless, which allowed the enemy destroy the structures.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{received}} a polarized response; critics alternately called the battles deep and satisfying or shallow and repetitive. Reviewers considered the combat mechanics to be simplistic while allowing for complex tactics, {{and others said}} that the requirement to actively defend against enemy attacks and enhance offense kept fights engaging. Others also praised the combat but considered the mechanics to be robust and elaborate, presenting a solid role-playing combat system concealed under the intentionally simplistic visuals. Some reviewers said {{that a lack of}} depth made combat gradually become repetitive; they said that even when combat is funny and engaging, {{by the end of the}} game the battles can become routine. Joystiq stated that defense was more <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> offense because it relied on time-sensitive reactions to creative enemy attacks such as Al Gore giving a presentation. Destructoid said there are too few powers available for offense for the game to remain interesting for long. GameSpot found combat was too easy and lacking in challenge because of an abundance of supplement items such as health packs that were found more frequently than they were used, and powerful abilities that quickly subdued opponents. Others disagreed, stating that the variety offered in combat, such as character abilities, allies, weapons, armor, and upgrades, ensured it always felt fun. The effects of the enhancements were sometimes considered to be confusing, and typically relying on simply equipping the highest level item available. Joystiq said the special characters that can be summoned during battle were extreme in terms of power and entertainment value.|$|E

25|$|In his paper, Pratt {{remarked that}} this {{permutation}} pattern order “seems {{to be the}} only partial order on permutation that arises in a simple and natural way” and concludes by noting that “from an abstract point of view”, the permutation pattern order “is even more <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> the networks we were characterizing”.|$|E
25|$|Around 1500, Europeans learnt how to cast iron, {{and shifted}} their cannon {{productions}} to one-piece iron muzzle-loaders. China started to adopt European breech-loading swivel guns from 1500 onward, limiting {{at the same}} time the production of their own muzzle-loaders, because of the high effectiveness of the breech-loading swivel gun as an anti-personnel gun, which to them was more <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> the sheer power of a cannonball.|$|E

25|$|Unlike the Eisenstaedt photograph, {{which is}} {{protected}} by copyright, this Navy photograph is {{in the public domain}} as it was produced by a federal government employee on official duty. While the angle of the photograph may be less <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> that of Eisenstaedt's photo, it clearly shows the actual location of the iconic kiss occurring {{in the front of the}} Chemical Bank and Trust building, with the Walgreens pharmacy signage on the building façade visible in the background.|$|E
25|$|Consider a {{periodic}} tiling by unit squares (it looks like infinite graph paper). Now cut one square into two rectangles. The tiling obtained {{in this way}} is non-periodic: there is no non-zero shift that leaves this tiling fixed. But clearly this example is much less <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> the Penrose tiling. In order to rule out such boring examples, one defines an aperiodic tiling to be one that does not contain arbitrary large periodic parts.|$|E

25|$|The String Sextet, {{entitled}} Souvenir de Florence, {{is considered}} {{by some to be}} more <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> the Piano Trio, better music intrinsically and better written. None of Tchaikovsky's other chamber works has a more positive opening, and the simplicity of the main section of the second movement is even more striking. After this very affecting music, the third movement progresses at least initially into a fresh, folksy world. Even more folksy is the opening of the finale, though Tchaikovsky takes this movement in a more academic direction with the incorporation of a fugue. This work has also been played in arrangements for string orchestra.|$|E
25|$|Elizabeth Branwell (2 December 1776 – 29 October 1842) {{arrived from}} Penzance in 1821, aged 45, {{after the death}} of Maria, her younger sister, to help Patrick look after the {{children}}, and was known as 'Aunt Branwell'. Elizabeth Branwell, who raised the children {{after the death of}} their mother, was a Methodist. It seems, nevertheless, that her denomination did not exert any influence on the children. It was Aunt Branwell who taught the children arithmetic, the alphabet, how to sew, embroidery and cross-stitching appropriate for ladies. Aunt Branwell also gave them books and subscribed to Fraser's Magazine, less <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> Blackwood's, but, nevertheless, providing plenty of material for discussion. She was a generous person who dedicated her life to her nieces and nephew, neither marrying nor returning to visit her relations in Cornwall.|$|E
25|$|Łojek {{notes that}} historiography {{of the fall}} of the Triple Alliance is sparse, as it was overshadowed by the {{interest}} in issues related to the French Revolution; as he notes, a war that never started is much less <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> the revolution that changed the world. He notes {{that the end of the}} alliance was a triumph of the Russian diplomacy, and failure of the British one, as well as a personal failure of Pitt, who since this defeat removed himself from the British foreign policy. From the Polish perspective, he notes that the failure of the Polish diplomacy to pursue an alliance with the Triple Alliance was another major factor which resulted in its weakening, and by correspondingly strengthening Russia, this Polish inactivity contributed to the fall of Poland. He notes that although some Poles, like Antoni Augustyn Deboli, argued for an alliance with Great Britain, king Stanisław August Poniatowski, who controlled most of Polish diplomacy, refused to stand in opposition to Russia, which in hindsight was a major blow for Poland.|$|E

50|$|I {{suggested}} to Oliver Stone {{to try to}} turn the soundtrack into a collage-of-sound, kind {{of the way the}} movie used music: make edits, add dialog, and make it something <b>interesting,</b> rather <b>than</b> a bunch of previously released music.|$|R

500|$|Writing for Den of Geek, James Hunt {{said that}} the risk of {{disintegration}} on the holodeck was [...] "insane" [...] and was rectified in later episodes. He thought that the episode stood out from the others in the first season due to the prototype holodeck story. [...] "The holodeck will break again and again over the years, but rarely in a way any more <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> this. Not that The Big Goodbye was particularly interesting, but it has the rare fortune of being first," [...] Hunt wrote.|$|E

500|$|Writing for Entertainment Weekly, David Brown {{rated the}} album a B−, finding that it [...] "isn’t {{eccentric}} enough" [...] {{compared to the}} film or series. Browne found that the contributions by Noel Gallagher and Ween matched the tone of The X-Files, but felt that Tonic, Filter, Sting and Aswad had been included out of commercial rather than artistic interest. Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club considered the soundtrack to be less <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> , finding the album's roster to be formulaic and several of its tracks to not be particularly [...] "revelatory" [...] or [...] "radical".|$|E
500|$|Los Angeles Times writer Gerrick Kennedy said {{he liked}} the Robin character's charm and {{chemistry}} with Katherine, and said their story arc [...] "has already grown infinitely more <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> the Angie Bolen mystery". He said the relationship made more sense for Katherine than her previous subplots involving her romance with Mike and her mental breakdown following their break-up. Isabelle Carreau of TV Squad said she was glad the episode was centered on the supporting cast, particularly praising the attention to Bob and Lee, but she said that {{did not like the}} direction the Andrew character had taken, and felt the relationship between Katherine and Robin had evolved too fast.|$|E
500|$|While the {{presentation}} was received positively, the gameplay received criticism from multiple reviews. [...] More specifically, the boss fights and repetitive hiding and chasing gameplay mechanics were cited as weak. GameSpot's Brad Shoemaker argued the cinematic portions were underpinned by the gameplay, believing that players would more likely {{want to finish}} the game for its storyline than the fun they'll have playing it. Game Revolution's AA White stated [...] "Clock Tower 3 is ultimately one of those games whose cinemas are more <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> the actual gameplay and from a gamer's standpoint, that's never a good thing." [...] Critics also agreed that the game felt too short.|$|E

6000|$|To {{most of the}} {{citizens}} it was drama; it broke the tedious monotony of everyday life; it was more productive of <b>interesting</b> conversation <b>than</b> a case of embezzlement or the burning of the county courthouse.
