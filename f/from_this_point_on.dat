5|$|<b>From</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>on,</b> {{the term}} 'dreadnought' became less widely used. Most pre-dreadnought battleships were {{scrapped}} or hulked after World War I, so the term 'dreadnought' became less necessary.|$|E
5|$|The Roman levy of 403BC was {{the first}} to be {{requested}} to campaign for longer than a single season, and <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> such a practice became gradually more common, if still not typical.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin began {{releasing}} {{his films}} through United Artists in 1923. <b>From</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> {{all of his}} films were of feature length. He produced, directed, and wrote these eight films and starred {{in all but the}} first. Beginning with City Lights Chaplin wrote the musical scores for his films as well.|$|E

50|$|After {{his arrival}} at the University of California, his {{interests}} diverged into several concurrently evolving paths. Thus, {{it is easier to}} talk about his work <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> based <b>on</b> common features between works.|$|R
50|$|The {{eventual}} {{outcome of}} this strategy was the Race to the Sea, where a series of flanking attempts by both sides resulted in an unbroken line stretching from Switzerland {{in the south to}} the North Sea in the north. <b>From</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> forward <b>on</b> the Western Front, flanking became impossible and the war eventually devolved into a protracted war of attrition.|$|R
5|$|This was {{not enough}} to cause a {{complete}} fallout between the two men, though <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> Warwick increasingly stayed away from court. The promotion of Warwick's brother George to Archbishop of York shows that the earl was still in favour with the king. In July 1465, when Henry VI was once more captured, it was Warwick who escorted the fallen king to his captivity in the Tower.|$|E
5|$|Unsatisfied {{with his}} own efforts, Homer takes on the biggest danger in Springfield, the nuclear power plant. After Homer rallies people to his cause, Mr. Burns decides to end the furor he is {{creating}} by offering him a new position as the plant safety inspector, along with a higher salary. Homer, torn between his principles and his livelihood, tearfully tells his followers that they must fight their battles alone <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> and takes the job.|$|E
5|$|When M-35 was {{routed through}} {{downtown}} Negaunee, it joined Bus. M-28 northward {{from the east}} fork of Silver Street on to US41/M-28. This routing was moved to bypass the city in 1964 when iron ore mining activity destabilized {{a portion of the}} M-35 routing southeast of town. <b>From</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>on,</b> Bus. M-28 has not shared its routing with any other state trunklines.|$|E
60|$|On the {{afternoon}} of the 16th a party of English, led by Wolfe, suddenly dashed forward, and, driving back a company of French, seized some rising ground within three hundred yards of the ramparts, and began to intrench themselves there. All night, the French kept up a furious fire at the spot, but, by morning, the English had completed their intrenchment, and <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> pushed <b>on,</b> until they had reached the foot of the glacis.|$|R
60|$|<b>From</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> I went <b>on,</b> and, in as {{few words}} as possible, related {{all that the}} reader knows about the packet, and the wishes of poor William Liston. I also showed him the miniature, at which he gazed with visible but {{suppressed}} emotion.|$|R
60|$|<b>From</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> {{she went}} <b>on</b> to explain in as few words as {{possible}} that three fleet horses were ready {{close at hand}} to carry off three {{of those who had}} been taken captive, and that she, Lightheart, must be one of the three.|$|R
5|$|After Edward I's death, Arundel {{became part}} of the {{opposition}} to the new king Edward II, and his favourite Piers Gaveston. In 1311 {{he was one of the}} so-called Lords Ordainers who assumed control of government from the king. Together with Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, he was responsible for the death of Gaveston in 1312. <b>From</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>on,</b> however, his relationship to the king became more friendly. This was to a large extent due to his association with the king's new favourite Hugh Despenser the Younger, whose daughter was married to Arundel's son. Arundel supported the king in suppressing rebellions by Roger Mortimer and other Marcher Lords, and eventually also Thomas of Lancaster. For this he was awarded with land and offices.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} new king was {{initially}} met with goodwill from his subjects, {{it was not}} long before certain members of the nobility became disaffected with Gaveston and the special relationship he enjoyed with Edward. On 2 December 1307, exactly one month after Gaveston's marriage, the King organised a tournament in Gaveston's honour at Wallingford Castle. Here Gaveston and his companions in arms handed a humiliating defeat to the earls of Warenne, Hereford, and Arundel. Gaveston won, according to various accounts of the events, either by bringing too many knights to the field, or simply by having a better contingent. <b>From</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> Warenne – and possibly also the other two earls – became hostile to Gaveston.|$|E
5|$|Imaginos/Desdinova becomes <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> an {{instrument}} of Les Invisibles' manipulation of human history. For the next sixty-three years, he insinuates himself {{into the world of}} European politics. He uses his ability to change identities {{to take the place of}} high-ranking officials, whose offices he uses to bring about Les Invisibles' will ("I Am the One You Warned Me Of"), introducing new knowledge and technology to the unsuspecting world ("The Siege and Investiture of Baron Von Frankenstein's Castle at Weisseria").|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of its {{position}} on the estuary of the Tagus River, Cabo da Guia had always been important for navigation. <b>From</b> 1523, <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> the Portuguese coast was illuminated by the chapel of the Hermitage of Our Lady of Guia. In 1537 the brothers of the hermitage raised a tower where a group of four or five oil lights were lit. This light was maintained by the brotherhood, keeping it lit for about eight months of the year.|$|R
60|$|The ice, however, was broken. <b>From</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> {{all went}} <b>on,</b> as Otto said, swimmingly.

50|$|The group {{recorded}} {{its debut}} album, Chambers (on Parlour Tapes+), in 2013 {{in collaboration with}} composers Hans Thomalla, Marcos Balter, LJ White, Chris Fisher-Lochhead, and Ben Hjertmann. Also in 2013, the group released <b>From</b> <b>This</b> <b>Point</b> Forward (<b>on</b> Azica Records), with bandoneon/accordion virtuoso Julien Labro and saxophone player Miguel Zenón. The band appeared on Swiss violin soloist Rachel Kolly d'Alba's 2015 record, Fin de siècle (Aparté), performing Ernest Chausson’s Concerto for Violin, Piano, and String Quartet and is featured on albums from composers Augusta Read Thomas and Ryan Ingebritsen.|$|R
5|$|Kruger's final {{administration}} was, Meintjes suggests, {{the strongest}} {{in the history}} of the republic. He had the former Free State President FW Reitz as State Secretary from June 1898 and Leyds, who set up an office in Brussels, as Envoy Extraordinary in Europe. The post of State Attorney was given to a young lawyer from the Cape called Jan Smuts, for whom Kruger presaged great things. The removal of Leyds to Europe marked the end of Kruger's longstanding policy of giving important government posts to Dutchmen; convinced of Cape Afrikaners' sympathy following the Jameson Raid, he preferred them <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>on.</b>|$|E
5|$|North of Wemple, the {{sporadic}} residences {{along the}} highway are replaced by a string of tank farms serving barges on the Hudson River. The industrial surroundings follow NY144 into the hamlet of Glenmont, centered on the route's junction with Glenmont Road. Here, NY144 crosses over another set of railroad tracks before heading northeastward from the community toward Normans Kill. The route runs alongside the Hudson River tributary and another set of tank farms to an intersection with NY32 (Corning Hill Road) near the Port of Albany–Rensselaer, where the NY144 designation terminates. NY32 continues northward <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> NY144's right-of-way, becoming South Pearl Street and immediately crossing Normans Kill to enter the city of Albany.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} work to {{represent}} this new orthography was Elihu Doty's Anglo-Chinese Manual with Romanized Colloquial in the Amoy Dialect, published in 1853. The manual {{can therefore be}} regarded as the first presentation of a pre-modern POJ, a significant step onwards from Medhurst's orthography and different from today's system in only a few details. <b>From</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> various authors adjusted some of the consonants and vowels, but the system of tone marks from Doty's Manual survives intact in modern POJ. John Van Nest Talmage has traditionally been regarded as the founder of POJ among the community which uses the orthography, although it now seems that he was an early promoter of the system, rather than its inventor.|$|E
50|$|KY 2631 {{begins at}} a {{junction}} with KY 263. It is an elevated route that winds eastward for 1.5 mi before descending to junction with Mouth of Gaspar Road near the Benleo community. <b>From</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> it continues <b>on</b> through rural surroundings 4.5 mi before reaching its eastern terminus with KY 263, {{west of the}} Richardsville community.|$|R
50|$|The cover depicts {{connections}} with previous albums, {{which became a}} trend in Clearlight album covers <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> onward. <b>On</b> the cover of Clearlight Symphony, cables connect an electrical box to a head, with one cable leading off in the distance, over the horizon. On the cover of Forever Blowing Bubbles, the same cable comes over the horizon, and ends in a disconnected DIN plug lying in the grass, blowing bubbles. The grass {{appears to be a}} redrawing of the marijuana leaves from the back cover of Delired Cameleon Family, but are now just ordinary lawn grass.|$|R
50|$|In 1853, {{the first}} council for the Township of East Whitby was formed, {{and the first}} reeve was John Ratcliffe. <b>From</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> in time <b>on</b> to 1870 the village grew to over 300 inhabitants. The village had: a {{township}} hall, 4 churches, blacksmiths, a post office, an Orange Hall, stores, carpenters, shoe shops, tailors, dressmakers, mills, asheries, copper shops, a tannery, a furniture factory, a harness shop, and 4 hotels.|$|R
5|$|Back in England, {{early in}} 1262, Edward fell {{out with some}} of his former Lusignan allies over {{financial}} matters. The next year, King Henry sent him on a campaign in Wales against Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, with only limited results. Around the same time, Simon de Montfort, who had been out of the country since 1261, returned to England and reignited the baronial reform movement. It was at this pivotal moment, as the King seemed ready to resign to the barons' demands, that Edward began {{to take control of the}} situation. Whereas he had so far been unpredictable and equivocating, <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> he remained firmly devoted to protecting his father's royal rights. He reunited with some of the men he had alienated the year before – among them his childhood friend, Henry of Almain, and John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey – and retook Windsor Castle from the rebels. Through the arbitration of King LouisIX of France, an agreement was made between the two parties. This so-called Mise of Amiens was largely favourable to the royalist side, and laid the seeds for further conflict.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} July 5 Battle of Osan, US troops began a {{continuous}} and unsuccessful ground {{campaign against the}} North Koreans, {{and many of the}} US air assets were used in close air support and airstrike roles to aid the faltering ground troops. <b>From</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> bombers mounted strategic bombing missions against military targets of all types supporting the North Korean ground troops, including ports, armor concentrations and supply stockpiles. A massive interdiction campaign ensued which would have implications for the upcoming conflicts. As more US Air Force, US Navy and US Marine Corps aviation assets arrived in the country, they increased their interdiction campaigns for several days striking bridges and strategic areas though going mostly unthreatened by the North Korean Air Force, though at least one F-80 was lost when it hit power lines during a bombing run.|$|E
5|$|Glinda and Elphaba {{meet again}} at the site where Nessarose has been crushed by {{a house with a}} girl named Dorothy inside. Fueled by the rivalry over Fiyero, the two have a heated argument. The guards arrive, and Elphaba guesses that Glinda {{arranged}} for all of this. Fiyero arrives as well, and holds Glinda hostage until Elphaba can escape. Glinda realizes that Fiyero does truly love Elphaba, and tells the guards not to hurt him, but they don't listen as they escort Fiyero to the field where they can interrogate him into revealing where Elphaba has fled to so they can recapture her. Elphaba tries to cast a spell to save his life and protect him from injury, but is frustrated by the limitations of her power. She decides that <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>on,</b> she will live up to her reputation as the Wicked Witch of the West ("No Good Deed").|$|E
50|$|<b>From</b> <b>this</b> {{starting}} <b>point</b> <b>on,</b> {{an impressive}} amount of discoveries took place: {{she could no}} longer accept the obsolete and fideistic dogmas of traditional astrology. Therefore, she set on the search for those astrological mechanisms - based both on observation and science - which lay under each phenomenon. Her unprecedented practice meant a real revolution in astrology as it had been considered up to that time and opened new roads to research, applied with seriousness and thoughtness. She was the starter of a new current of thought both through her lessons and her books, the real milestone for astrologers and for those interested in the zodiac.|$|R
50|$|On 29 May 2013, it was {{announced}} that three sports made the final shortlist; squash, baseball/softball, and wrestling. Five other sports (karate, roller sports, sport climbing, wakeboarding, and wushu) were excluded <b>from</b> consideration at <b>this</b> <b>point.</b> <b>On</b> 8 September 2013, at the 125th IOC Session, the IOC selected wrestling {{to be included in the}} Olympic program for 2020 and 2024. Wrestling secured 49 votes, while baseball/softball secured 24 votes and squash got 22 votes.|$|R
5000|$|An earlier single, a {{cover of}} the disco hit [...] "Boogie Nights" [...] was also {{included}} on the album, while a planned follow-up to the Eurovision song, [...] "Rescue Me" [...] (also a cover) went unreleased. This album {{marked the end of}} Sonia's hit-making period, which had lasted since 1989. <b>From</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> Sonia concentrated <b>on</b> TV and stage work, while two more singles and a final album failed to find success.|$|R
5|$|His {{first study}} of {{mathematics}} began with papers by George Pólya {{and by the}} crystallographer Friedrich Haag on plane symmetry groups, sent {{to him by his}} brother Berend, a geologist. He carefully studied the 17 wallpaper groups, and created periodic tilings with 43 drawings of different types of symmetry. <b>From</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> he developed a mathematical approach to expressions of symmetry in his art works using his own notation. Starting in 1937, he created woodcuts based on the 17 groups. His Metamorphosis I (1937) began a series of designs that told a story through the use of pictures. In Metamorphosis I, he transformed convex polygons into regular patterns in a plane to form a human motif. He extended the approach in his piece Metamorphosis III, which is four metres long.|$|E
5|$|In 788, Staurakios is {{recorded}} as attending {{as a judge}} in the bride show for the 17-year-old Constantine VI, along with Irene and the young Byzantine emperor himself. Maria of Amnia was chosen, although Constantine was unhappy about the breaking up of his earlier betrothal with Rotrude, Charlemagne's daughter. <b>From</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>on,</b> he began to resent his mother's control over state affairs {{and the power of}} her eunuch officials. Along with a few trusted conspirators, Constantine planned to arrest Staurakios and exile him to Sicily, while he would assume his position as effective co-ruler of the Byzantine Empire. Their plans were preempted by Staurakios, however: he persuaded Irene to arrest, torture, exile or imprison Constantine's associates, while Constantine himself was placed under house arrest. Next, Irene demanded of the army an oath of loyalty, whose wording placed her before her son in precedence. This demand provoked a mutiny by the soldiers of the Armeniac Theme, which then spread throughout the Anatolian armies, which assembled in Bithynia and demanded Emperor Constantine's release. Bowing to their pressure, Irene capitulated and Constantine was installed as sole ruler in December 790. Among Constantine's first acts was to have Staurakios flogged, tonsured, and exiled to the Armeniac Theme, while all other eunuch officials were likewise exiled.|$|E
5|$|MD 355 {{begins in}} Friendship Heights, Montgomery County at the {{intersection}} with Western Avenue NW and Military Road NW {{on the border of}} Washington D.C.. It heads north <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> Wisconsin Avenue, a six-lane divided highway. Wisconsin Avenue continues south into Washington, ending in Georgetown at an intersection with K Street underneath the Whitehurst Freeway just north of the Potomac River. From the D.C. border, MD355 heads north through areas of retail and high-rise buildings in Friendship Heights including The Shops at Wisconsin Place that are served by the Red Line of the Washington Metro. Past Friendship Heights, the route continues into wooded residential areas of Somerset before passing the Chevy Chase Country Club {{on the east side of}} the road and residential areas of Chevy Chase to the west. It comes to an intersection with MD 191 (Bradley Boulevard/ Bradley Lane). Past this intersection, MD355 enters Bethesda, where it heads back into commercial areas with high-rise buildings.|$|E
60|$|My guide {{from the}} Durbar had staid behind at Lainteng, and though Meepo {{and all my}} men well {{knew that this was}} not the frontier, they were ignorant as to its true position, nor could we even {{ascertain}} which of the rivers was the Lachen.* [The eastern afterwards proved to be the Lachen.] The only routes I possessed indicated two paths northwards from Lamteng, neither crossing a river: and I therefore thought it best to remain at Zemu Samdong till provisions should arrive. I accordingly halted for three days, collecting many new and beautiful plants, and exploring the roads, of which five (paths or yak-tracks) diverged <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> one <b>on</b> either bank of each river, and one leading up the fork.|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} end of the Anniversary Outer Circle Trail is 0.6 km <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>point.</b> Head south <b>on</b> the Chandler Highway and the Anniversary Trail can be found just across the bridge that crosses the Eastern Freeway. A safer alternative is to continue along the Yarra River Trail from the Chandler Highway to Willsmere Park - 1.5 km. You can cross under the Eastern Freeway at Willsmere Park and traverse to the Anniversary Trail via Hyde Park.|$|R
5000|$|<b>From</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> Mackreth {{concentrated}} <b>on</b> financial speculations, with sidelines as a loan shark and bookmaker: Gilly Williams, {{writing to}} George Selwyn in 1768, mentions him as dealing {{heavily in the}} bets for and against the success of John Wilkes in the election for the [...] that year.
