25|$|Aggression {{can have}} {{adaptive}} benefits or negative effects. Aggressive behavior {{is an individual}} or collective social interaction that is a hostile behavior {{with the intention of}} inflicting damage or harm. Two broad categories of aggression are commonly distinguished. One includes affective (emotional) and hostile, reactive, or retaliatory aggression that is a response to provocation, and the other includes instrumental, goal-oriented or predatory, in which aggression is used as a mean to achieve a goal. An example of <b>hostile</b> <b>aggression</b> would be a person who punches someone who insulted him or her. An instrumental form of aggression would be armed robbery. Research on violence from a range of disciplines lend some support to a distinction between affective and predatory aggression. However, some researchers question the usefulness of a hostile versus instrumental distinction in humans, despite its ubiquity in research, because most real-life cases involve mixed motives and interacting causes.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was: first, to offer a few {{theoretical}} considerations on the concept of human aggression and its main types; and second, to analyse the relationship between those types of aggression and other related psychological constructs, such as anger, hostility, and impulsivity, summarizing the main empirical results of our research in progress. In order to assess their eventual correlations, several self-report techniques were compared: a) AQ, used to measure several kinds of aggression, anger, and hostility; b) CAMA, a questionnaire already used in a variety of cultures, for measuring attitudes toward interpersonal aggression in different instrumental and hostile situations; c) ASQ, an instrument for measuring experienced anger and its expression in assertive or aggressive ways; and d) BIS, used to prove three impulsiveness sub-traits: motor, attentional, and non-planning impulsiveness. The different definitions of aggression may be grouped according to whether the primary goal is distress or harm, focusing primarily on the objective infliction of harm, or on the subjective intention of harming. Most classifications in the literature show two kinds of aggression, even if different names are used: <b>Hostile</b> <b>Aggression</b> (among other names it is also known as 'reactive, impulsive, or affective') is an act primarily oriented to hurt another individual; and Instrumental Aggression (also known as 'proactive, premeditated, or predative') is a means or tool for solving problems or for obtaining a variety of objectives. As predicted, there was a positive correlation between experience and expression of anger. Anger involved physiological arousal and prepared for aggression. Anger and impulsiveness were also positively correlated with <b>hostile</b> <b>aggression,</b> but not with instrumental aggression.

40|$|Aggressive {{behaviours}} {{within the}} sport of hockey appear to be increasing in both prevalence and consequence (Biasca, Wirth, & Tegner, 2002). Accordingly, this area of inquiry is currently garnering {{a considerable amount of}} attention from society and academics alike. The problem however, is that our current understanding of these behaviours has been deemed both incomplete and unreliable. The inconsistencies inherent within this body of knowledge have been traced back to a variety of methodological shortcomings. The purpose of this investigation was to assess <b>hostile</b> <b>aggression</b> using a more ecologically valid and comprehensive research design. Ten Junior B hockey games were tapped and subsequently coded by three independent observers, using a validated operational list. Two hundred and fifty-nine behaviours were extrapolated and examined according to the score differential, period, position of the aggressor, status of the aggressor's team, and whether the aggressor {{was a member of the}} home or visiting team. It was concluded that the frequency of aggressive behaviours significantly differed according to the score differential, and status of the aggressor's team (p . 01). It was also determined that the majority of aggressive acts (69. 1 1 %) across these ten games went unsanctioned. This highlights the profound influence that "positive misses" have on penalty measures of aggression, while concurrently highlighting the ecological validity present with observational designs. Consequently, by assessing aggressive behaviour in a more inclusive and ecologically valid manner, a more accurate picture of the frequency and distribution of <b>hostile</b> <b>aggression</b> may be provided...|$|E

40|$|Aggressive {{behavior}} can be classified in hostile and instrumental aggressions (anderson & bushman, 2002). this classification is mostly synonymously used with reactive and proactive aggression, whereas the differences between hostile and instrumental aggression lie on three dimensions, the primary goal, amount of anger and planning and calculation(bushman & anderson, 2001). although there are rating instruments and experimental paradigms to measure <b>hostile</b> <b>aggression,</b> there is no instrument to measure instrumental aggression. the following study will present an account to measure instrumental aggression with an experimental laboratory paradigm. the instrument was firstly tested on two samples of normal young adolescents (n 1 = 100; amage. = 19. 14; n 2 = 60; amage. = 21. 46). the first study revealed a strong correlation with a laboratory aggression paradigm measuring <b>hostile</b> <b>aggression,</b> but no correlations with self-reported aggression in the buss and perry questionnaire. these results were replicated in a second study, revealing an additional correlation with aggressive but not adaptive assertiveness. secondly the instrument {{was part of the}} evaluation of the reasoning and rehabilitation program r&r 2 (ross, hilborn & lidell, 1984) in an institution for male adolescents with adjustment problems in switzerland. the r&r 2 is a cognitive behavioral group therapy to reduce antisocial and promote prosocial cognitions and behavior. the treatment group (n= 16; rangeage = 15 - 17) is compared to a no treatment control group (n= 24; rangeage = 17 - 19) preand post- treatment. further aggressive behavior was surveyed and experimentally measured. hostile rumination, aggressive and adaptive assertiveness, emotional and social competence were included in the measurement to estimate construct validity...|$|E

40|$|Aggressive {{driving is}} {{considered}} an important road-safety concern for drivers in highly motorised countries. However, understanding of the causes and maintenance factors fundamental to aggressive driving is limited. In keeping with theoretical advances from general aggression research such as the General Aggression Model (GAM), research has begun to examine the emotional and cognitive antecedents of aggressive driving {{in order to better}} understand the underlying processes motivating aggressive driving. Early findings in the driving area have suggested that greater levels of aggression are elicited in response to an intentionally aggressive on-road event. In contrast, general aggression research suggests that greater levels of aggression are elicited in response to an ambiguous event. The current study examined emotional and cognitive responses to two hypothetical driving scenarios with differing levels of aggressive intent (intentional versus ambiguous). There was also an interest in whether factors influencing responses were different for <b>hostile</b> <b>aggression</b> (that is, where the action is intended to harm the other) versus instrumental aggression (that is, where the action is motivated by an intention to remove an impediment or attain a goal). Results were that significantly stronger negative emotion and negative attributions, as well as greater levels of threat were reported in response to the scenario which was designed to appear intentional in nature. In addition, participants were more likely to endorse an aggressive behavioural response to a situation that appeared deliberately aggressive than to one where the intention was ambiguous. Analyses to determine if greater levels of negative emotions and cognitions are able to predict aggressive responses provided different patterns of results for instrumental aggression from those for <b>hostile</b> <b>aggression.</b> Specifically, for instrumental aggression, negative emotions and negative attributions were significant predictors for both the intentional and the ambiguous scenarios. In addition, perceived threat was also a significant predictor where the other driver’s intent was clearly aggressive. However, lower rather than higher, levels of perceived threat were associated with greater endorsement of an aggressive response. For hostile aggressive behavioural responses, trait aggression was the strongest predictor for both situations. Overall the results suggest that in the driving context, instrumental aggression {{is likely to be a}} much more common response than <b>hostile</b> <b>aggression.</b> Moreover, aggressive responses are more likely in situations where another driver’s behaviour is clearly intentional rather than ambiguous. The results also support the conclusion that there may be different underlying mechanisms motivating an instrumental aggressive response to those motivating a hostile one. In addition, understanding the emotions and cognitions underlying aggressive driving responses may be helpful in predicting and intervening to reduce driving aggression. The finding that drivers appear to regard tailgating as an instrumental response is of concern since this behaviour has the potential to result in crashes...|$|E

But this was aimed to exert pressure on Britain over Czechoslovakia. Promised arms shipments never eventuated. This {{was not the only}} diplomatic front on which al-Husseini was active. A month after his visit to Döhle, he wrote to the American Consul George Wadsworth (August 1937), to whom he professed his belief that America was remote from imperialist ambitions and therefore able to understand that Zionism 'represented a <b>hostile</b> and imperialist <b>aggression</b> directed against an inhabited country’. In a meeting with Wadsworth on 31 August, he expressed his fears that Jewish influence in the United States might persuade the country to side with Zionists. In the same period he courted the French government by expressing a willingness to assist them in the region.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous {{research}} examining {{the development of}} anxious and depressive symptoms (i. e., internalizing symptoms) from childhood to adolescence has often assumed that trajectories of these symptoms do not vary across individuals. The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify distinct trajectories of internalizing symptoms from childhood to adolescence, and to identify risk factors for membership in these trajectory groups. In particular, we sought to identify risk factors associated with early appearing (i. e., child onset) symptoms versus symptoms that increase in adolescence (i. e., adolescent onset). METHOD: Drawing on longitudinal data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth, latent class growth modeling (LCGM) was used to identify distinct trajectories of internalizing symptoms for 6, 337 individuals, from age 4 - 5 to 14 - 15. Multinomial regression was used to examine potential early-life risk factors for membership in a particular trajectory group. RESULTS: Five trajectories were identified as follows: "low stable" (68 %; reference group), "adolescent onset" (10 %), "moderate stable" (12 %), "high childhood" (6 %), and "high stable" (4 %). Membership in the "adolescent onset" group was predicted by child gender (greater odds for girls), stressful life events, <b>hostile</b> parenting, <b>aggression,</b> and hyperactivity. Membership in the "high stable" and "high childhood" trajectory groups (i. e., child-onset) was additionally predicted by maternal depression, family dysfunction, and difficult temperament. Also, several significant gender interactions were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Causal mechanisms for child and adolescent depression and anxiety may differ according to time of onset, as well as child gender. Some early factors may put girls at greater risk for internalizing problems than boys...|$|R
