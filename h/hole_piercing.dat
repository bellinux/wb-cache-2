40|$|The Iharkút {{locality}} in the Bakony Mountains {{of western}} Hungary {{has provided a}} rich and diverse assemblage of Late Cretaceous vertebrates. Here we present two specimens of this assemblage, a plate fragment of the bothremydid turtle Foxemys trabanti, and a partial skull roof of the hylaeochampsid crocodilian, Iharkutosuchus makadii, that exhibit pathological traits, such as shallow and deep pits, bisected pits, and scores on their surface, {{and in the case}} of the skull roof, also a <b>hole</b> <b>piercing</b> through the entire bone thickness. Morphological and bone histological features of these pathological traits imply that they probably represent bite marks rather than deformations due to pre-mortem shell diseases, infections or post-mortem invertebrate bioerosion, and microbial activity. Morphological similarities with experimentally investigated crocodilian tooth marks suggest that both elements bear the bite marks of a crocodilian predator with typical conical teeth, possibly the Allodaposuchus-like crocodile, also known from the locality. The inferred tooth marks on the dorsal surface of the Iharkutosuchus skull roof indicate a rarely documented predator-prey interaction between two different crocodilian taxa rather than antagonistic behaviour over common resources. Nevertheless, more comparative studies are needed on different traumatic as well as non-traumatic bone pathologies that may eventuate in bite-mark-like abnormalities. © 2014...|$|E
40|$|Copyright © 2011 SAE International In vehicle crash events {{there is}} the {{potential}} for fracture to occur at the processed edges of structural components. The ability to avoid these types of fractures is desired in order to minimize intrusion and optimize energy absorption. However, the prediction of edge cracking is {{complicated by the fact that}} conventional tensile testing can provide insufficient data in regards to the local fracture behavior of advanced high strength steels. Fracture prediction is also made difficult because there can be inadequate data on how the cutting processes used for <b>hole</b> <b>piercing</b> and blanking affect the edge condition. In order to address these challenges, research was undertaken to analyze edge fracture in simple test pieces configured with side notches and center holes. Test specimens were made from a number of advanced high strength steels including 590 R (C-Mn), 780 T (TRIP), 980 Y (dual phase) and hot stamp 1500 (martensitic). Edges were prepared by three different cutting processes: shearing, laser, and water jet ablation. The specimens were pulled to failure and local fracture strains were measured by digital image correlation. Component level tests were also done on simple hat sections that featured a notch cut into the flange and side wall by either water jet or punching. These hat sections were made from select steel grades and were deformed in a three-point bend crush mode to initiate failure at the notch. The results indicate that edge fracture in high strength steels is highly influenced by both edge condition and specimen geometry. In addition, it was concluded that certain material grades can be more notch or punch sensitive than others depending on their metallurgical structure...|$|E

40|$|Laser {{piercing}} is used {{to generate}} {{a starting point for}} laser cutting. The <b>pierced</b> <b>hole</b> is normally larger than the kerf width, which means that it cannot lie on the cut line.

Oxygen and nitrogen were used as assist gases, with pressures ranging from 0. 3 to 12 bar. The sizes, geometries and piercing time of the holes produced have been analysed. The <b>pierced</b> <b>hole</b> size decreases with increasing gas pressure and increasing laser power. Oxygen assist gas produced larger diameter holes than nitrogen.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{behaviour}} of the Dirac fermions {{in a general}} spherically symmetric black hole background with a non-trivial topology of the event horizon. Both massive and massless cases are taken into account. The analytical studies of intermediate and late-time behaviour of massive Dirac hair {{in the background of}} a black hole with a global monopole and dilaton black <b>hole</b> <b>pierced</b> by a cosmic string will be conducted. It was revealed {{that in the case of}} a global monopole swallowed by a static black hole the intermediate late-time behaviour depends on the mass of the Dirac field, the multiple number of the wave mode and the global monopole parameter. The late-time behaviour is quite independent of these factors and has the decay rate proportional to $t^{- 5 / 6 }$. As far as the black <b>hole</b> <b>pierced</b> by a cosmic string is concerned the intermediate late-time behaviour depends only on the hair mass and the multipole number of the wave mode while the late-time behaviour dependence is the same as in the previous case. The main modification stems from the topology of the $S^ 2 $ sphere pierced by a cosmic string. This factor modifies the eigenvalues of the Dirac operator acting on the transverse manifold.
