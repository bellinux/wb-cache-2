5|$|Two {{months into}} his term, Dow {{inadvertently}} ran afoul {{of his own}} prohibition laws. After setting up a committee to dispense alcohol for medicinal and industrial use (the only uses permitted), Dow ordered $1600 worth of alcohol and stored it at City Hall. Dow neglected to appoint an official agent to hold it there; because the <b>invoice</b> was in his name, this placed Dow in technical violation of the law. Dow's enemies seized on the mistake and demanded that the police search the municipal building for illegal liquor. Because the recent additions to the Maine law had removed judicial discretion, the judge {{had no choice but}} to issue the warrant. Police seized the alcohol, but did not arrest Dow.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{different}} currencies in the <b>invoicing</b> {{of international trade}} transactions {{plays a major role}} in the international transmission of economic fluctuations. Existing studies argue that an exporter’s <b>invoicing</b> choice reflects structural aspects of her industry, such as market share and the price sensitivity of demand, the hedging of marginal costs, due for instance to the use of imported inputs, and macroeconomic volatility. We use a new highly disaggregated dataset to assess the roles of the various <b>invoicing</b> determinants. We find support for the factors identified in the literature, and document a new feature, in the form of a link between shipments size and <b>invoicing.</b> Specifically, larger transactions are more likely to be <b>invoiced</b> in the importer’s currency. We offer a potential theoretical explanation for the empirical link between transaction size and <b>invoicing</b> by allowing <b>invoicing</b> to be set through a bargaining between exporters and importers, a feature that is absent from existing models despite its empirical relevance. international trade; <b>Invoicing</b> currency; pass-through; vehicle currency...|$|R

The attorney's fees are not regulated. They are also {{not part of the}} title insurance premium, though the title insurer may include those fees within its <b>invoice</b> as a convenience to the attorney rendering the opinion.

40|$|Cross-country {{differences}} {{in the choice of}} an <b>invoicing</b> currency in international trade is one reason for cross-country {{differences in}} estimated exchange rate coefficients in short-run balance of trade equations. If exports are <b>invoiced</b> in domestic currency while imports are <b>invoiced</b> in a foreign currency, a depreciation will increase the domestic currency value of outstanding import contracts, and may cause the balance of trade to fall in the short run. Countries with different <b>invoicing</b> patterns will have different effects on the short-run trade balance following a depreciation. We explore a simple theory of <b>invoicing</b> currency choice, drawing inferences regarding the likely choices for 14 countries. This allows a classification of countries according to the expected short-run balance of trade effect of a currency depreciation.

25|$|The {{advantage}} of the VAT system over the sales tax system is that under sales tax, the seller has no incentive to disbelieve a purchaser who says {{it is not a}} final user. That is to say the payer of the tax has no incentive to collect the tax. Under VAT, all sellers collect tax and pay it to the government. A purchaser has an incentive to deduct input VAT, but must prove it has the right to do so, which is usually achieved by holding an <b>invoice</b> quoting the VAT paid on the purchase, and indicating the VAT registration number of the supplier.|$|E

25|$|A {{decision}} on 13 September from Spain's public prosecutors {{to order a}} criminal probe of all local mayors who had publicly announced they would help stage the independence referendum—totalling over 700—came {{the day after the}} Constitutional Court had accepted the Spanish government's request to suspend the second of the two laws that had been approved by the secessionist majority in the Catalan parliament the previous week. The probe meant that prosecutors could choose to present criminal charges—or even arrest, if failing to answer the summons—local mayors who disobeyed the Constitutional Court's ruling. As part of a series of moves to block the Catalan referendum, prosecutors had also instructed police officials to seize ballot boxes, election flyers and other items that could be of use in the illegal vote, whereas the Constitutional Court had instructed regional government officials to show how they were preventing the vote from going ahead within a 48-hour deadline. In response, the Catalan government sent a letter to Treasury Minister Cristóbal Montoro announcing that it would stop sending weekly financial accounts to Spain's central government, a previously-established obligation that was meant to verify whether the region was using public money for the promotion of its independence drive as well as a requirement for the region's access to a funding programme to autonomous communities established in 2012. The Spanish government then proceeded to take direct control of most of Catalonia's <b>invoice</b> payments.|$|E

(An <b>invoice</b> showing that carpeting for the entire {{first floor of the}} capitol had cost one-tenth that amount did not stop Chandler from repeating the claim, which he said [...] "didn't hurt anybody, and people liked to hear it".) After a Wetherby administration official approved the purchase of African mahogany paneling for the governor's office, Chandler charged that Wetherby had gone [...] "clear to Africa" [...] to find paneling for his office and promised that, if elected, he would use good, honest Kentucky wood for decoration. He also denounced the construction of a turnpike connecting Elizabethtown and Louisville, the state fairgrounds, and Freedom Hall as unnecessary.|$|E
