25|$|An SPI <b>host</b> <b>adapter</b> {{lets the}} user {{play the role}} of a master on an SPI bus {{directly}} from a PC. They are used for embedded systems, chips (FPGA, ASIC, and SoC) and peripheral testing, programming and debugging.|$|E
25|$|On August 31, 2006, Creative {{announced}} {{the availability of}} an upgraded player with 60GB capacity. This version has a USB <b>host</b> <b>adapter</b> cable, which enables users to transfer photos from a digital camera directly to the player. It is only available in black and white, and was initially slightly thicker than the 30GB model. On March 11, 2007, the 60GB model was upgraded with a new slimmer profile - the same thickness as the 30GB version.|$|E
50|$|A SCSI <b>host</b> <b>adapter</b> connects {{host system}} to boot from a SCSI device, but also {{facilitates}} {{configuration of the}} <b>host</b> <b>adapter.</b> Typically a device driver, linked to the operating system, controls the <b>host</b> <b>adapter</b> itself.|$|E

50|$|For {{all modern}} ATA <b>host</b> <b>adapters,</b> {{this is not}} true, as modern ATA <b>host</b> <b>adapters</b> support {{independent}} device timing. This allows each device on the cable to transfer data at its own best speed. Even with older adapters without independent timing, this effect applies only to the data transfer phase of a read or write operation. This is usually the shortest part of a complete read or write operation.|$|R
50|$|The ASPI manager {{software}} {{provides an}} interface between ASPI modules (device drivers or applications with direct SCSI support), a SCSI <b>host</b> <b>adapter,</b> and SCSI devices {{connected to the}} <b>host</b> <b>adapter.</b> The ASPI manager is specific to the <b>host</b> <b>adapter</b> and operating system; its primary role is to abstract the <b>host</b> <b>adapter</b> specifics and provide a generic software interface to SCSI devices.|$|E
50|$|Typically a {{hard disk}} drive (HDD) {{installs}} into a drive bay; cables connect the drive to a <b>host</b> <b>adapter</b> and power source. If the personal computer lacks an available bus on a compatible <b>host</b> <b>adapter,</b> then one may have to install an adapter into an expansion slot. The Hardcard supplies its own <b>host</b> <b>adapter,</b> and doesn't require an empty drive bay.|$|E
5000|$|On a {{parallel}} SCSI bus, a device (e.g. <b>host</b> <b>adapter,</b> disk drive) is identified by a [...] "SCSI ID", {{which is a}} number in the range 0-7 on a narrow bus and in the range 0-15 on a wide bus. On earlier models a physical jumper or switch controls the SCSI ID of the initiator (<b>host</b> <b>adapter).</b> On modern host adapters (since about 1997), doing I/O to the adapter sets the SCSI ID; for example, the adapter often contains a BIOS program that runs when the computer boots up and that program has menus that let the operator choose the SCSI ID of the <b>host</b> <b>adapter.</b> Alternatively, the <b>host</b> <b>adapter</b> may come with software that must be installed on the host computer to configure the SCSI ID. The traditional SCSI ID for a <b>host</b> <b>adapter</b> is 7, as that ID has the highest priority during bus arbitration (even on a 16 bit bus).|$|E
50|$|The {{method of}} address {{translation}} defined and the protocol permit Fibre Channel storage devices and <b>host</b> <b>adapters</b> to be attached to an IP-based fabric using transparent gateways.|$|R
50|$|Many {{companies}} have manufactured SCSI <b>host</b> <b>adapters</b> {{at one time}} or another, but the market structure has been remarkably stable over the years. Two leading manufacturers are Adaptec and LSI Logic.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{operations}} {{supported by}} ASPI are discovery of <b>host</b> <b>adapters</b> and attached devices, and submitting SCSI commands to devices via SRBs (SCSI Request Blocks). ASPI supports concurrent execution of SCSI commands.|$|R

5000|$|PC {{systems have}} SATA {{controllers}} {{built into the}} motherboard, typically featuring two to eight ports. Additional ports can be installed through add-in SATA <b>host</b> <b>adapters</b> (available in variety of bus-interfaces: USB, PCI, PCIe).|$|R
50|$|A SCSI {{subsystem}} is used {{to allow}} a number of high-performance peripherals to be attached. One SCSI peripheral is a PC Card reader that can support Fortezza. Multiple SCSI <b>host</b> <b>adapters</b> can be included.|$|R
50|$|Since 2013, {{with the}} release of various ExpressCard and Thunderbolt-to-PCI Express adapters, it is again {{possible}} to use SCSI devices on laptops, by installing PCI Express SCSI <b>host</b> <b>adapters</b> using a laptop's ExpressCard or Thunderbolt port.|$|R
50|$|In most cases, the <b>host</b> <b>adapter</b> {{would have}} a similar header-style connection. In some cases, though, the <b>host</b> <b>adapter</b> end of the cable would use a {{different}} connector. For example, in the Sun 260 series chassis (used for the Sun 3/260 and Sun 4/260 computers), the connector was the same 3-row 96-pin connector used to attach peripheral cards to the VMEbus backplane.|$|E
50|$|As {{an example}} of a mixed bus, {{consider}} a SCSI wide <b>host</b> <b>adapter</b> with an HD-68 male connector connected to a SCSI narrow disk drive with an HD-50 female connector. You might make this connection with a cable that has an HD-68 female connector on one end and an HD-50 male connector on the other. Inside the cable's HD-68 connector, there is termination for the high half of the bus and the cable contains wires for only the low half. The <b>host</b> <b>adapter</b> determines that the disk drive uses only the low half of the bus, so talks to it using only the lower half. The converse example—a SCSI narrow <b>host</b> <b>adapter</b> and SCSI wide disk drive also works.|$|E
50|$|Production of the Lt. Kernal ceased in 1991. Fortunately, {{most of the}} {{components}} used in the original design were industry standard parts, {{making it possible to}} make limited repairs to the units. In 2010, a re-creation of the Lt. Kernal was produced by MyTec Electronics. It was called the Rear Admiral HyperDrive and used an upgraded DOS called RA-DOS. The Rear Admiral parts could be used to upgrade the older Lt. Kernal, e.g. chips from the Rear Admiral <b>host</b> <b>adapter</b> could be used to upgrade the chips in the Lt. Kernal host adapter; or if the Lt. Kernal is missing its <b>host</b> <b>adapter,</b> the Rear Admiral <b>host</b> <b>adapter</b> could be used in its place.|$|E
25|$|SPI {{protocol}} being a {{de facto}} standard, some SPI <b>host</b> <b>adapters</b> also have the ability of supporting other protocols beyond the traditional 4-wires SPI (for example, support of quad-SPI protocol or other custom serial protocol that derive from SPI).|$|R
50|$|For NCQ to be enabled, {{it must be}} {{supported}} and enabled in the SATA <b>host</b> bus <b>adapter</b> and in the hard drive itself. The appropriate driver must be loaded into the operating system to enable NCQ on the <b>host</b> bus <b>adapter.</b>|$|R
50|$|On some <b>host</b> <b>adapters,</b> {{this problem}} is solved by using a SCSI bridge to {{electrically}} split the bus into an SE and an LVD half, so LVD devices can operate at full speed. Other adapters may provide multiple buses (channels).|$|R
50|$|A RAID {{processing}} unit (RPU) is an integrated circuit that performs specialized calculations in a RAID <b>host</b> <b>adapter.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{computer}} can contain {{more than one}} <b>host</b> <b>adapter,</b> which can greatly {{increase the number of}} SCSI devices available.|$|E
50|$|The <b>host</b> <b>adapter</b> usually {{assumes the}} role of SCSI initiator, in that it issues {{commands}} to other SCSI devices.|$|E
50|$|The {{company was}} mostly known for CPU accelerators and SCSI <b>host</b> <b>adapters</b> for the Commodore Amiga 500 and the Amiga 2000 {{computer}} series. The company liquidated itself in July 1995. A new company GVP-M picked up {{rights to the}} Amiga products.|$|R
50|$|HBA (<b>Host</b> Bus <b>Adapter)</b> full offload {{is found}} in iSCSI <b>host</b> <b>adapters</b> which present {{themselves}} as disk controllers to the host system while connecting (via TCP/IP) to an iSCSI storage device. This type of TCP offload not only offloads TCP/IP processing but it also offloads the iSCSI initiator function. Because the HBA appears to the host as a disk controller, {{it can only be}} used with iSCSI devices and is not appropriate for general TCP/IP offload.|$|R

50|$|The B1000, B2000, C3000, J5000 and J7000 {{were also}} based on the PA-8500 processor, but had a very {{different}} architecture. The U2/Uturn IOMMU and the GSC bus is gone, replaced with the Astro IOMMU, connected via Ropes to several Elroy PCI <b>host</b> <b>adapters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Unlike PATA, both SATA and eSATA support hot {{swapping}} by design. However, {{this feature}} requires proper support at the host, device (drive), and operating-system levels. In general, all SATA devices (drives) support hot swapping (due {{to the requirements}} on the device-side), also most SATA <b>host</b> <b>adapters</b> support this command.|$|R
