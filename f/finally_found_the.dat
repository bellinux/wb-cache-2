5|$|The Vishnu Purana narrates {{another version}} {{of the origins of}} Badrinath. According to the tradition, Dharam had two sons, Nar and Narayanboth of which are modern names of Himalayan mountains. They chose the place to spread their {{religion}} and each of them wed the spacious valleys in the Himalayas. Searching for an ideal place to set up a hermitage, they came across the other four Badris of the Pancha Badri, namely Bridha Badri, Yog Bhadri, Dhyan Badri and Bhavish Badri. They <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> hot and cold spring behind the Alaknanda River and named it Badri Vishal.|$|E
5|$|Doro Pesch {{was cast}} as the warrior Meha in the prehistoric action movie Anuk-Der Weg des Kriegers (Anuk-The Way of the Warrior), written, {{directed}} and interpreted by Luke Gasser and shot in Switzerland in 2005. The film was released in 2006 and features also Marc Storace, lead singer of the Swiss hard rock band Krokus. During the period of shooting, she wrote and recorded new songs in Switzerland with local session musicians {{and the production of}} Gasser, who used three of those songs for the soundtrack of the movie. More songs were recorded in Germany in the spare time between tours with her band and usual collaborators, and released in 2006 in the album Warrior Soul. The screenplay for a second movie with the same cast was written in the following years and Gasser <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> funding to start production in 2012.|$|E
5|$|In 1688, the Spanish sent {{three more}} expeditions, two by sea {{and one by}} land. The land expedition, led by Alonso De León, {{discovered}} Jean Gery, who had deserted the French colony and was living in Southern Texas with the Coahuiltecans. Using Gery as a translator and guide, De León <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> French fort in late April 1689. The fort and the five crude houses surrounding it were in ruins. Several months before, the Karankawa had attacked the settlement. They destroyed the structures and left the bodies of three people, including {{a woman who had}} been shot in the back. A Spanish priest who had accompanied De León conducted funeral services for the three victims. The chronicler of the Spanish expedition, , wrote that the devastation was God's punishment for opposing the Pope, as Pope Alexander VI had granted the Indies exclusively to the Spanish. The remains of the fort were destroyed by the Spanish, who also buried the French cannons left behind. The Spanish later built a fort on the same location.|$|E

25|$|After a {{short and}} {{unremarkable}} amateur career, Schilling turned professional on September 30, 2006, taking on Lawson Baker in an 84kg/185lb bout on ten days' notice in Inglewood, California. He recalls striking his opponent {{with all his}} might, only to watch him continue to advance unfazed.

25|$|The attack force staged {{through an}} {{airfield}} on Kendari, {{spending the night}} of 16 January there, refueling and taking off {{in the early hours}} next morning. Two targets had been assigned: the B-17s were to attack shipping in Menado Bay, while the LB-30S bombed an airport in the vicinity. However, their orders were so unclear that the LB-30 crews could not be sure where the airport was and they had to spend fifteen or twenty minutes searching before they <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> field at Langoan, beside a lake, about 20 miles south of Menado. Almost in the instant that the last plane reported its bombs away, they were hit by five Zeros, and for six minutes the three LB-30s were under fire. They managed to shoot down one of the Zeros before themselves escaping into the weather; but two of the aircraft had been fatally hurt.|$|E

25|$|With Liverpool down to ten men, Manchester United {{were now}} {{able to control the}} tempo of the game as they wished. The Red Devils pushed forward in search of a second goal, and Liverpool {{continued}} to weather the storm, but, with 10 minutes to go, United <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> goal they were looking for. Nani, just on as a substitute, took a corner from the left hand side, which Cristiano Ronaldo headed in from seven yards; his first goal against Liverpool. Then, two minutes later, Nani combined well with Wayne Rooney, playing a one-two with the striker, before firing the ball home from 20yards to make the final score 3–0. The win put United six points ahead of Arsenal with seven games left to play, and meant the Gunners had to win their match against Chelsea later that afternoon. Chelsea, however, came from behind to pull off a 2–1 victory. This propelled Chelsea into second place, five points behind Manchester United.|$|E
25|$|D.C.'s homestand {{continued}} with a match against the Eastern Conference leading Philadelphia Union. United {{took the lead}} when Kemp intercepted a pass in the defensive end, raced through the Union defense and beat the goalie to the far post. However, the Union tied the game on a free kick just before halftime. The visitors took the lead when Acosta was dispossessed {{as he tried to}} dribble out of the defensive end and former United star Chris Pontius continued a remarkable renaissance in his first season away from D.C. and put the Union ahead. United's coach, Ben Olsen was ejected late in the second half for protesting one of many uncalled fouls on Acosta. Despite missing their leader, United pushed hard for a tying goal. Despite having a couple of apparent goals waved off by the officials, the team <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> tying goal in the fourth minute of stoppage time, when Birnbaum got his head {{on the end of a}} service into the box by Nyarko. Despite being only a draw, it was a very emotional goal for the players and fans, but the home draw meant the team remained outside of playoff contention.|$|E
25|$|For the 1907–08 season, {{a new set}} of {{forwards}} {{were signed}} but goals were still hard to come by. Despite possessing a strong half back line made up of Hawkes, Fred Hawkes and Fred White, the club slumped to 18th place and made a financial loss. The following year the team recovered to ninth place, but the financial situation worsened. The forwards <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> goal in 1909–10, but too many goals were let in at the other end and the club finished 15th. The continuing financial problems caused the sale of forward pair John Smith and Thomas Quinn to Millwall. By 1910–11 gates were up, finances were being brought under control and the club challenged for the title before eventually finishing in ninth place. Optimism was in the air {{at the start of the}} 1911–12 season, but it was to finish in tragedy – popular full-back Sammy Wightman died from injuries sustained in a match against Brighton & Hove Albion, and a high wage bill, a spate of injuries and a lack of goals contributed to the club being relegated to the Southern League's Second Division.|$|E

25|$|Machado Santos {{had already}} got into action and didn't attend the assembly. Instead, {{he went to}} the {{military}} quarters of the 16th Infantry Regiment where a revolutionary corporal had triggered a rebellion involving the majority of the garrison. A commander and a captain were killed when they made an attempt to control it. Entering a barracks with dozens of members of the Carbonaria, the naval officer went on with about 100 soldiers that entered the 1st Artillery Regiment, where the captain Afonso Palla and a few sergeants, introducing some civilians into the barracks, had already taken administration and captured all officials that refused to join them. With the arrival of Machado Santos two columns were formed which were placed under the leadership of captains Sá Cardoso and Palla. The first went to meet the 2nd regiments of infantry and light infantry, also sympathisers of the rebellion, to go on to Alcântara where it was to support the naval barracks. The original route intersected with a Municipal Guard outpost which forced the column to follow a different route. After a few confrontations with the police and civil forces, it <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> column led by Palla. Together, the columns advanced to Rotunda, where they entrenched at around 5am. The stationed force was composed of around 200 to 300 men of the 1st, 50th and 60th Regiments of Artillery, 50 to 60 men of Infantry 16 and around 200 civilians. The captains Sá Cardoso and Palla and the naval commissary Machado Santos were among the 9 officials in command.|$|E

500|$|Early test {{screenings}} were poor, {{and many}} critics and industry observers were {{skeptical about the}} show's chances of success. The first season received generally mixed reviews, and several commentators found it too similar to The Office. The premiere episode was watched by 6.77million households, but the viewership declined almost every week in the Nielsen ratings. A season low of 4.25million households watched the final episode, [...] "Rock Show".

500|$|Not all reviews were negative. Several {{commentators}} {{said the}} show had potential, {{and pointed out}} that early episodes of The Office had been flat before the series found its footing.

Several commentators declared that Parks and Recreation had <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> right tone both generally and for the Leslie Knope character in particular. Several reviewers, even {{those who did not}} enjoy the show, applauded Poehler's comedic abilities and said her talent, timing and likability helped elevate the series above some of its flaws. Reviewers also said they particularly liked Aziz Ansari as Tom Haverford, and Chris Pratt as Andy Dwyer.

[...] Berridge also claimed the show didn't set out to look for an Asian family, saying: [...] "We wanted a new family as there were various elements missing from the show. I thought we were short on males and needed a surge of testosterone," [...] and said that the characters were formed around the actors: [...] "We didn't set out knowing exactly what we wanted.
