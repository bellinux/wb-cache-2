40|$|Hill country erosion is {{a serious}} {{environmental}} issue in New Zealand. After widespread damage from storms in 2004, Horizons Regional Council initiated the SLUI programme. This programme relies on whole <b>farm</b> <b>plans</b> (Whole <b>Farm</b> Business <b>Plans)</b> as the core tool to address erosion on hill country farms. Several regional councils in New Zealand, like Horizons, rely on whole <b>farm</b> <b>plans</b> and continue to seek ways to achieve {{a high level of}} voluntary adoption by farmers. A single case study was used to examine the phenomena of adoption of whole <b>farm</b> <b>plans.</b> This research answered the question: What factors influence the adoption by farmers of whole <b>farm</b> <b>plans,</b> and why these factors are influential? A review of historical <b>farm</b> <b>plans</b> identified plans most similar to Horizons Whole <b>Farm</b> Business <b>Plans.</b> These were located in the Wairarapa and this formed the case area. Farmers from two catchments in the Wairarapa, and key informants were interviewed to identify factors influencing adoption of <b>farm</b> <b>plans.</b> Findings from this study, in the main, support adoption diffusion literature for agricultural innovations. The specific mix of interrelated factors that influence the adoption of <b>farm</b> <b>plans,</b> and the reasons for their influence, were identified and described. Characteristics of this case included the widespread adoption of <b>farm</b> <b>plans,</b> and farmers' perceived <b>farm</b> <b>plan</b> implementation as secondary to the core farm business. Factors associated with the compatibility of the innovation to the core farm business and the credibility of the organisation delivering <b>farm</b> <b>plans</b> provided important influences on adoption of <b>farm</b> <b>plans.</b> The circumstances of the farmers and their farm did not strongly influence adoption in this study because <b>farm</b> <b>plans</b> are customised and take into account each individual's circumstances. For an innovation such as <b>farm</b> <b>plans</b> that is considered secondary to the core farm business, factors easing implementation were important. This was contributed to by the characteristics of the innovation and by the delivery and support from the organisation.

The study used three farm models; namely, (1) a profit maximization LP model, (2) a profit maximization with a consumption constraint model, and (3) the Target MOTAD to obtain risk optimal <b>farm</b> <b>plans.</b> The study showed that the farmers had a better chance of securing their consumption by applying the risk optimal <b>farm</b> <b>plan.</b> This <b>farm</b> <b>plan</b> suggests that a farmer plants not less than 50 % of his total land holding with food crops, especially millet, and also concentrates on production of the cash crop groundnut rather than sesame.

40|$|Approximately half of Iowa 2 ̆ 7 s {{farms are}} {{operated}} under {{some form of}} leasing arrangement. The terms of these leasing arrangements {{play a vital role}} in determining how resources are allocated on these farms. Imperfections in leasing systems may reduce returns to landlords and tenants and restrict the total amount of product available to society. Under many leases in use, the <b>farm</b> <b>plan</b> which maximizes returns to the landlord 2 ̆ 7 s resources may not be the optimum <b>farm</b> <b>plan</b> from the tenant 2 ̆ 7 s standpoint, and vice versa. While the conditions of resource efficiency are not attained on many owner-operated farms, the leasing arrangement, ideally, should not contribute further to inefficiences in resource use. Within an owner-operated farm, then, an optimum allocation of the owner 2 ̆ 7 s resources is reached when these resources are organized in a manner to maximize his profits. The problem is more difficult on rented farms, however, because specialized resources are separately furnished by the landlord and tenant. Resource efficiency on rented farms is achieved only when the combined resources of the landlord and tenant are organized into a <b>farm</b> <b>plan</b> which maximizes profits to their combined resources. An efficient lease should permit and encourage the adoption of this single <b>farm</b> <b>plan</b> by the landlord and tenant. In other words, an efficient lease is one which allows the same <b>farm</b> <b>plan</b> to be most profitable for both the landlord and the tenant; this plan should also be the one which is optimum for the farm as a whole, without regard to resource ownership.

He runs {{away from home and}} lives rough at a nearby playground (theorising that this would be the last place the authorities would look). Realising that Mini is the root of his troubles, he goes to confront her. Mini suggests that he had sex with Poppy because she was the same mental age as him, and orders him to leave, but he manages to get through to her, telling her that he doesn't like her as she's behaving. Alo continues to live rough and ponders running away, before being found by Dewi, his family farmhand, who gives him food and informs him that his family is worried for him. He offers him money if he does want to run away, but Alo decides to stay, grow up and resolve his issues. He goes to Poppy's home to meet with her family, and Poppy claims that she had lied to the police to get back at Alo for breaking up with her. Her parents immediately begin arguing, and Alo, seeing that this is the root of Poppy's issues, silences them, before refuting Poppy's lie and admitting that they had had sex without his knowledge about her age. He is promptly beaten up by her father and thrown out. The next day, Mini comes to his <b>farm,</b> <b>planning</b> to tell him about her pregnancy. Before she can do so, however, Alo receives a call from Poppy, who informs him that her parents have split up, and her mother had forced her father to drop the charges against him, threatening to report him for beating Alo up.

40|$|A risk {{farmers have}} to cope with is annual changes in the {{availability}} of irrigation water. In this paper the relationship between irrigation water allocated to farmers and the incomes they derive in the Coleambally Irrigation Areas (CIA) in Australia is quantified. It is shown empirically that farmers reduce the area cropped when faced with reduced water availability. Increasing the availability of water does not necessarily lead to more stable (less volatile) income streams, as it offers the opportunity to include more water intensive, yet also more risky, crops in the cropping pattern (e. g. rice). However, it does lead to an overall increase in incomes. It was found that rice is the dominant crop for all levels of risk aversion, as shown by a stochastic dominance approach and by the stochastic efficiency with respect to a function. The optimal <b>farm</b> <b>plan</b> portfolio besides rice also includes a substantial amount of wheat if irrigators are somewhat risk averse, while more risk-averse farmers prefer more maize in their <b>farm</b> crop <b>plans.</b> The relative reduction in expected income from the optimal <b>farm</b> <b>plan</b> chosen, given a rather risk averse farmer, compared to the expected income of the optimal <b>farm</b> <b>plan</b> chosen by a risk neutral farmer, is approximately 9 %...|$|R

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{livelihood}} {{of the poor}} in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) much {{attention has been paid}} to the development of new agricultural technologies. We hypothesize that farmers can also improve their livelihood through cooperation. Partial cooperation, in which knowledge is shared or bargaining power improved, is relatively common in SSA, while cooperation where all resources are fully shared, which we address, has rarely been investigated. An important pre-requisite to establish such cooperation, is the need for a fair division rule for the gains of the cooperation. This paper combines linear programming and cooperative game theory to model the effects of cooperation of (individual) households on income and <b>farm</b> <b>plans.</b> Linear programming establishes insight in the optimal <b>farm</b> <b>plans</b> in cooperation, and cooperative game theory is used to generate fair division rules. The model is applied to a village in Northern Nigeria. Households are clustered based on socio-economic parameters, and we explore cooperation between clusters. Cooperation leads to increased income and results in changes in <b>farm</b> <b>plans,</b> because more efficient use of resources leads to more intensified agriculture (labour intensive – high value crops) ...|$|R
