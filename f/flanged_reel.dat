With them, the pigment is an ink that dries on typing paper {{but not on}} the ribbon, and the ribbon is mounted at each end to a <b>flanged</b> <b>reel</b> whose hub engages with one of the axles. Only the axle onto which the ribbon is winding is driven, and the ribbon module is intended to work with an axle-driving mechanism that reverses the direction of rotation when the undriven axle reaches the point where there is no ribbon left wound around it. Thus the full length of the ribbon shuttles back and forth between reels, and each position along it is struck twice in each cycle of the ribbon's motion (once in the right-to-left phase and once in the left-to-right).|$|E
