In our planning we have not ignored the problem of ending the war, nor would we ignore it {{in the event of a}} war. And, of course, we have, and we will keep, a survivable and enduring capability to attack the full range of targets, including the Soviet economic base, if that is the appropriate response to a Soviet strike.|$|E

500|$|Because Confessions was his {{directing}} debut, Clooney {{took inspiration}} from friends Steven Soderbergh and the Coen brothers for his filmmaking style. Writer Charlie Kaufman {{said he was}} dissatisfied with the way Clooney treated the screenplay. [...] "I {{spent a lot of}} time working on the script," [...] he explained, [...] "but I don't think he was interested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> I was interested in. I've moved on and I don't have any animosity towards Clooney, but it's a movie I don't really relate to." [...] Clooney acknowledged that Kaufman's original script contained [...] "really funky scenes that would never reach the green light of being a studio film." [...] A drug addiction subplot was removed based on Barris's request for historical authenticity.|$|E

500|$|Although he did {{not focus}} less on Christian lyrical {{material}} for Undone, mainstream radio was on Millard's mind when he wrote the lyrics on the album. Millard attempted to write lyrics that, while still focused on God, tapped into the things people deal with every day. Further, he avoided using Christian jargon, as {{people who are not}} churchgoers might not understand what those terms mean; instead, he tried to be [...] "clearer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> [...] were talking about". Another impact on the songwriting was the band's experiences over the previous year; while working on Undone, Millard and {{the other members of the}} band lost eight people close to them. Millard noted that [...] "There's a lot of personal stuff on [...] about the things we've gone through and how Christ has been the solution". One particular song, [...] "Homesick", was written after two incidents. The first incident occurred during the holiday season of 2004; a friend of Millard's lost her twin babies during pregnancy and was so far along in the pregnancy that doctors had to induce labor. After attending the funeral for the two babies, Millard wrote the chorus to the song. However, he didn't write any more to [...] "Homesick" [...] after that as {{he did not}} want to [...] "fake" [...] his way through writing it. Following the death of his brother-in-law Chris, however, Millard finished the song. Although Undone was [...] "essentially complete" [...] at that point, the band recorded and included it on the album.|$|E

2500|$|The {{argument}} {{that the existence of}} God can be known to all, even prior to exposure to any divine revelation, predates Christianity. St. Paul made this argument when he said that pagans were without excuse because [...] "since the creation of the world [...] invisible nature, namely, his eternal power and deity, has been clearly perceived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that have been made". In this Paul alludes to the proofs for a creator, later enunciated by St. Thomas and others, but that had also been explored by the Greek philosophers.|$|E

And that recipe of short-term investments in growth and jobs with a long-term path of fiscal responsibility is the right approach to take for, I think, not only the United States but also for Europe." ...|$|E
2500|$|Knowledge is {{explained}} by the principle that elements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> outside us are perceived by the corresponding elements in ourselves. Like is known by like. The whole body is full of pores and hence respiration takes place over the whole frame. In the organs of sense these pores are specially adapted to receive the effluences which are continually rising from bodies around us; thus [...] perception occurs. In vision, certain particles go forth from the eye to meet similar particles given forth from the object, and the resultant contact constitutes vision. Perception {{is not merely a}} passive reflection of external objects.|$|E

2500|$|Hugh Candidus, a 12th-century {{chronicler of}} Peterborough, {{described}} Seaxwulf as a [...] "man of great power", {{and a man}} [...] "zealous and , and well skilled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> of this world, {{and also in the}} affairs of the [...]" [...] Another biographical reference to Seaxwulf is in a charter of King Æthelred of Mercia. This charter is a late 11th or early 12th century forgery, written for Peterborough Abbey– meaning that it nonetheless existed there before Hugh Candidus wrote his chronicle– but it is of historical interest for some of the locally important information which it contains. It describes Seaxwulf as a recently orphaned foreigner, and this biographical detail is not found in any other known, surviving source.|$|E
2500|$|According to Bede, Medeshamstede {{was founded}} {{by a man named}} Sexwulf, who was also its first abbot.

He was later appointed Bishop of Mercia, and his near contemporary Eddius Stephanus mentions, in his Life of St Wilfrid, [...] "the profound respect of the bishopric which the most reverend Bishop Sexwlfus had formerly ruled".|$|E

[...] According to Justice Potter Stewart, Warren’s philosophical foundation were the [...] "eternal, rather bromidic, platitudes in which he sincerely believed" [...] and [...] "Warren's great strength was his simple belief <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> we now laugh at: motherhood, marriage, family, flag, and the like." [...] He was highly moralistic but not particularly cerebral, with his biographer Bernard Schwartz concluding that with [...] "Warren's bluff masculine bonhomie, his love of sports and the outdoors, and his lack of intellectual interests or pretensions, {{we end up with}} a typical representative of the middle America of his day." ...|$|E

2500|$|Erculiani {{also took}} {{advantage}} of her literary platform to advocate for the recognition of women as adept contributors to the scientific community. [...] She was provoked by the querrelle des femmes (debate on women): a literary and philosophical debate about the intellectual capacities of women, which focused heavily on the women of her region. In reaction, Erculiani introduced her book with two prefatory letters of dedication in defense of women. Within the first, to Queen Anna of Poland, she wrote, [...] "I don't know what malignant star causes [...] to refuse to recognize greatness, except <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> they accomplish themselves." [...] Within the second, to her readers, Erculiani stated, [...] "It will undoubtedly amaze some that I, a woman, have set myself to write and publish on a subject that {{does not belong to}} women (according to the custom of our age); but...you will find that women are not without the same abilities and virtues as men." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to a musnad (supported) hadith, Muhammad made {{a speech}} at Ghadir Khumm in which he said, [...] "Of whomsoever I am the mawla, Ali is his mawla". Mawla {{has a number of}} {{meanings}} in Arabic. Although Shi'ites translate it as [...] "master" [...] or [...] "ruler" [...] and believe that Muhammad did not make 120,000 people wait in the desert for three days only to tell them to support Ali, some Sunni scholars say that Muhammad was saying that his friends should befriend Ali; it was a response to Yemeni soldiers who had complained about Ali. A similar incident is described in Ibn Ishaq's Sirah, in which Muhammad reportedly said: [...] "Do not blame Ali, for he is too scrupulous <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> of God, or the way of God, to be blamed."(Guillaume p.650) Sunnis believe that interpreting an expression of friendship and support as the appointment of a successor is incorrect, and the leadership dispute after Muhammad's death proved that his statement was not an appointment.|$|E

Dacre [...] "pays hate-writing columnists online", she wrote in 2017 before quoting one [...] "not worth a name check" [...] contributor, [...] "as they speak his mind". Andrew O'Hagan wrote in the London Review of Books in 2017 that Dacre's [...] "worst effect" [...] on the Mail [...] "has been to let it seem mired <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> it hates, as if society’s worst excesses were mostly an outgrowth of its own paranoid imagination".

Kelly spoke on the songs that he had written for Rihanna saying; [...] "Rihanna's a worldwide superstar at this point and she's performing in stadiums and arenas now, so I wanted songs that reflected her audience, when I was in London she was performing at a festival in front of like 30,000 to 40,000 people. So I didn't want small songs that only worked on radio, so I tried to do anthemic big stadium-themed songs." ...|$|E
