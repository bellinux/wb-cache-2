25|$|A {{story is}} told of the young duke of Burgundy, Fénelon's pupil, who was then only eleven years old, sending 50 louis to La Fontaine as a present of his own motion. But, though La Fontaine {{recovered}} for the time, he was broken by age and infirmity, and his new hosts had to nurse rather than to entertain him, which they did very carefully and kindly. He <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more work, completing his Fables among other things; {{but he did not}} survive Madame de la Sablière much more than two years, dying on 13 April 1695 in Paris, at the age of seventy-three. When the Père Lachaise Cemetery opened in Paris, La Fontaine's remains were moved there. His wife survived him nearly fifteen years.|$|E

500|$|The {{head coach}} dealt with young players who {{differed}} from the white, East-Coast students {{with whom he had}} previously worked. At the beginning, he used the then-customary coaching methods of rough language and a strict routine. The Native American students were unaccustomed to such an approach, and several key players stopped attending practices. Warner adjusted his technique, saying that he [...] "found I could get better results. I don't think I ever swore at a player from that time.

500|$|Arad later explained, [...] "We {{were working}} on what we called Spider-Man 4 {{and it was the}} same team [...] The problem was we didn't have a story that was strong enough and {{warranted}} ... another movie. And Sam Raimi ... realized we [...] have a good reason to make another one. And between [...] and Tobey and obviously the studio, we all went into it not feeling good about the next story." [...] Tolmach said one reason to restart the series was that the producers felt the core Spider-Man story was that of a boy becoming a man. Screenwriter Steve Kloves did a polish of Sargent's script, saying he had originally declined the opportunity to do so but relented [...] "as a favor" [...] to the filmmakers. [...] "I also really wanted to write for Emma Stone, because I like to write for women and I particularly like Emma," [...] he explained. [...] "So ...I did basically character and dialogue, and that was enjoyable for me. So that was my hand in it. And I <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> plot work, {{but a lot of the}} plot was done." [...] He did [...] "a little bit" [...] of dialog for Peter Parker / Spider-Man. In April 2012, writer-director Paul Feig said that Webb [...] "invited me on set, and I <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of writing for that movie, for one of the high school scenes".|$|E

500|$|The [...] "Loser Must Bow" [...] {{match between}} the Junkyard Dog and Harley Race (with Bobby Heenan and [...] "The Queen of Wrestling" [...] The Fabulous Moolah) followed. Prior to the match [...] "Mean" [...] Gene Okerlund interviewed Heenan, Race, and Moolah backstage, where Moolah {{predicted}} that Junkyard Dog {{would have to}} bow to the King as {{he is supposed to}} do. Bobby then gave Moolah the crown and told her {{to put it on the}} King's head after the match, [...] "As only the Queen of Wrestling can do". Junkyard Dog came out to the ring to a big ovation in the Silverdome. During the match, the two battled back and forth, with Race even trying unsuccessfully to give the prone Dog a falling headbutt which naturally failed. Following this Race recovered enough to give the Junkyard Dog a belly to belly suplex when he was distracted by Bobby Heenan to get the win. Due to the pre-match stipulation, JYD <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bow and then hit Race from the blindside with a steel chair to a rousing ovation from the crowd. After attacking Race, Junkyard Dog took the King's royal robe and left the ring with it in hand to a standing ovation.|$|E
500|$|Many reviews {{praised the}} series' pop culture {{reference}}s. Carina Belles applauded the series for making subtle pop culture references, citing Pinkie Pie's mention of [...] "Chocolate Rain", {{a reference to}} a popular Internet meme. Many reviews and critics positively commented on the episode's ending, which featured a parody of the closing scenes to the original Star Wars. Cyriaque Lamar from i09 wrote positively of the scene, writing, [...] "Honestly, modern My Little Pony fandom {{is one of those things}} I'm live-and-let-live about, even though it baffles me entirely [...] this morning's episode of the show <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> homage to A New Hope." [...] i09 later named the scene one of [...] "The Best Television Moments of 2011". John Farrier from Neatorama wrote, [...] "It’s hard for Bronies to get respect from some quarters, but [...] scene alone says much in favor of the show." [...] The entertainment site Dorkly, an affiliate of CollegeHumor, featured a video comparing the two scenes and wrote, [...] "May the adorable be with you." [...] Topless Robot writer Anne Mathews named the Star Wars parody the [...] "Nerdiest Easter Egg" [...] in My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic, writing, [...] "This scene is a direct shoutout to the fans and completely cements the creator Lauren Faust's geek cred.

This hasn't been one of my favorite places on the fan side. People haven't always liked me here. But this was for those guys up in the stands today." [...] Second-place finisher Menard was pleased with his result, saying he had a good car throughout the duration of the race: [...] "Car had speed in it all day. Didn't make any chassis adjustments, just <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of air pressure after the first run to free it up. It was just all track position really." [...] In the post-race press conference, third-place finisher Ragan said that he felt that he had a car which could have secured the victory under the right circumstances, but believed it was a good day for his team: [...] "We always seem to be pretty fast here on the superspeedway track, so that just goes to show you how much effort our Roush Fenway team is putting into this program." ...|$|E
