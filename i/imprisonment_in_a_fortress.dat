60|$|In the circumstances, Ankarstrom had {{conceived}} it {{his duty}} to surrender to the superior force of Russia, thereby securing immunity for the persons and property of the inhabitants. In this the King perceived his chance to indulge his hatred. He caused Ankarstrom to be arrested and accused of high treason, it being alleged against {{him that he had}} advised the people of Gothland not to take up arms against the Russians. The royal agents found witnesses to bear false evidence against Ankarstrom, with the result that he was sentenced to twenty years' <b>imprisonment</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fortress.</b> But the sentence was never carried out. Gustavus had gone too far, as he was soon made aware. The feelings against him which hitherto had smouldered flamed out at this crowning act of injustice, and to repair his error Gustavus made haste, not, indeed, to exonerate Ankarstrom from the charges brought against him, but to pardon him for his alleged offences.|$|E

[...] Although the authorities originally sentenced him to be incarcerated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fortress</b> where {{he would have been}} able to pursue some semblance of his professional activities, Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia found this sentence to be illegal since he was not sentenced to death and “graciously” commuted it to lifetime <b>imprisonment</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> reformatory where his head was shaved, and he had to wear prisoner's garb and spend his time spinning wool. He was eventually transferred to Spandau Prison in Berlin, where his friend and former student Carl Schurz helped him escape the prison at Spandau and reach London, England in November 1850.|$|R
50|$|Although some {{considered}} Jangülian a hero, he {{was subsequently}} sentenced to death, but the Sultan commuted his sentence to life <b>imprisonment</b> <b>in</b> exile. He was exiled to Akka, Palestine and imprisoned <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fortress.</b> He remained there until being pardoned and released in 1896. However, some sources claim he escaped.|$|R
50|$|A {{misdemeanor}} {{is a crime}} {{punishable by}} <b>imprisonment</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> county or city jail or detention facility not to exceed one year. Except where the law specifies a different punishment, a misdemeanor is punishable by <b>imprisonment</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> county jail not exceeding six months and/or a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars. However, many misdemeanor offenses specifically list a punishment that exceeds the punishment listed in Penal Code section 19. For example, a misdemeanor violation of Battery on a Peace Officer is punishable by <b>imprisonment</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> county jail for up to one year and/or a two thousand dollar fine.|$|R
50|$|He was {{involved}} in the abortive Bonapartist coups at Strasbourg in 1836 and at Boulogne-sur-Mer in 1840. After the second coup, he was arrested and condemned to twenty years' <b>imprisonment</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fortress,</b> commuted to mild detention at Versailles. There he wrote a book to prove that the Egyptian pyramids were built to prevent the Nile from silting up. The book was published in 1845 under the title De la destination et de l'utilité permanente des Pyramides.|$|E
5000|$|Not {{wanting to}} release such {{important}} {{opponents of the}} war effort, old charges of preaching dangerous doctrines and plotting against the state were levied against Bebel and Liebknecht in 1872. [...] The pair were {{convicted and sentenced to}} two years in Festungshaft (<b>imprisonment</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fortress),</b> which was spent at the famous Königstein Fortress. For insulting the German emperor, Bebel was additionally sentenced to nine months' ordinary imprisonment. This incarceration served to increase Bebel's prestige among his party associates and the sympathetic public at large.|$|E

With others of his colleagues he was in 1850 brought to trial for having taken part in organizing a movement for refusal to pay taxes; he was condemned to fifteen months <b>imprisonment</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fortress,</b> but left the country before the sentence was executed.|$|E

The Russian commander of the destroyed Baltic fleet, Admiral Zinovy Rozhdestvenski (who was badly wounded in the battle) attempted to take full responsibility for the disaster, and the authorities (and rulers of Russia) acquitted him at his trial. However, they made Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov, {{who had tried to}} blame the Russian Government, a scapegoat. Nebogatov was found guilty and sentenced to ten years <b>imprisonment</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fortress,</b> but was released by the Tsar after serving only two years.|$|E
50|$|Libelt {{took part}} in the failed November Uprising against Russia in 1830, and was imprisoned for nine months at Magdeburg. Since 1839 he became the head of a secret {{committee}} started to organise yet another uprising against the partitioning powers, which was nicknamed the Libelt Committee - Komitet Libelt). For taking part in the Greater Poland Uprising (1846) He was sentenced by the Prussian authorities to 20 years of <b>imprisonment</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fortress</b> for taking part in the Greater Poland Uprising (1846). However, he was amnestied in 1848 and returned to Posen (Poznań), where he {{took part in}} the Greater Poland Uprising (1848) and joined various organisations supporting the independence of Poland (Polish National Committee and Revolutionary Committee). During the Spring of Nations he was elected as {{one of the members of}} the Frankfurt Parliament; he also {{took part in the}} Slavic Congress in Prague in June 1848.|$|E
5000|$|Aided by Comintern pressure, Brandler's faction {{took over}} {{leadership}} of the KPD in 1921, with Brandler replacing Paul Levi as KPD Chairman in February. Brandler was leader of the party during the KPD's ill-fated [...] "March Action" [...] of 1921, a role which placed him {{on a collision course}} with civil authorities following the failure of the uprising. In June 1921, Brandler was convicted in a treason trial and sentenced to five years' <b>imprisonment</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fortress.</b> The term was ended abruptly in November of that same year, after which Brandler left for Moscow, where he sat on the Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI) on behalf of the German party. Brandler was elected to the ECCI Presidium at its First Enlarged Plenum in February 1922. Brandler was also active in the affairs of the Red International of Labor Unions (Profintern) during this interval.|$|E

5000|$|In Dresden {{he became}} a one-person Polish {{institution}} helping the political refugees, and organising literary life and information about Poland. With the death of many great poets of Romanticism, he became the unquestionable literary authority and the favourite of the public. In 1870 as the editor of [...] "Tydzień" [...] he expressed his skepticism about the dogma, approved at the First Vatican Council, that the pope is infallible as far as questions regarding the faith are concerned. That made him unpopular among the national orthodox church authorities, {{but he did not}} lose popularity among his readers. In 1879 in Kraków week-long celebrations on the 50th anniversary of the beginning of his literary career were held. In 1883 he was arrested in Berlin and charged with collaboration with French military intelligence, and a year later he was sentenced by the tribunal in Leipzig to {{three and a half years}} of <b>imprisonment</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fortress.</b> He served the sentence in the Magdeburg Fortress. As a result of his illness he was temporarily released on bail and went to Italy to improve his health, and after the earthquake there he sought refuge in Geneva in 1886. There, already suffering from cancer, he contracted pneumonia, which was the direct cause of his death on 19 March 1887. His body was brought to Kraków and placed in the vault where the meritorious were buried in the Church of St. Michael the Archangel and St Stanislaus Bishop and Martyr and Pauline Fathers Monastery.|$|E
40|$|Bust {{portrait}} of a middle-aged man. Curly hair, moustache and "necklace" beard. Loosely tied knot and gold chain with pendant hanging over his buttoned vest. Signature in margin of mounted sheet. German poet and philologist, born at Wevelingen, Prussia, Oct. 24, 1807; died at Brussels Jan. 16, 1882. Educated at Krefeld, Cologne, Bonn, and Munich (Ph. D. 1830). In his "Anfänge der Kunst Unter den Griechen in Verbindung mit der Erklärung einer Phönicischen Inschrift," read before a learned society (1831), he advanced the theory that Phoenician was a linguistic derivative of Hebrew, and that Phoenicia had exercised a profound influence {{on the art of}} early Greece. Despite the efforts of his patron, the Archbishop of Cologne, and of others, Wihl's hopes for a university career were doomed to failure because he declined to be baptized. Wihl then entered upon a journalistic career at Frankfurt and Hamburg and published his first volume of poems at Mayence in 1837. During a trip to England two years later he wrote his "Englischer Novellenkranz," but his account of Heine, written at Paris for the Hamburg "Telegraph," brought upon him the enmity of the poet. In 1840 he returned to Frankfurt, where, with the help of funds advanced by a Catholic banker named Seufferheld, he established a boarding-school for boys. This school, however, existed for only eighteen months because the authorities forbade him to admit Catholic pupils. During the next few years, Wihl lived at Amsterdam and at Utrecht as a teacher and journalist, until he was called to Paderborn as an editor. A recklessly radical article which he published in a local paper during the Revolution of 1848, however, brought on him a sentence of a year's <b>imprisonment</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fortress,</b> and he fled to France, where he became professor of German at Paris and Grenoble. On the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian war, he retired from patriotic motives to Brussels, where he resided for the remainder of his life on a pension. Digital imag...|$|E
