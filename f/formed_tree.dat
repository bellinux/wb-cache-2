50|$|Deletions {{are very}} similar to insertions. One first finds the key k in one of the {{balanced}} binary search trees and delete it from this tree T. To ensure that all balanced binary search trees contain O(log M) elements, one merges T with the balanced binary search tree of its successor or predecessor if it contains less than (log M)/4 elements. The representatives of the merged trees are removed from the x-fast trie. It is possible for the merged tree to contain more than 2 log M elements. If this is the case, the newly <b>formed</b> <b>tree</b> is split into two trees of about equal size.

Separate male and female flowers form on the same individual plant. The fruiting structure is a woody cone, shaped like a short cylinder with its diameter roughly equal to or slightly greater than its length. The fruit is a winged samara 7 - 9 mm long.

40|$|This work {{presents}} a general layer- 2 approach for routing and load balancing in Wireless Infrastructure Mesh Network The key idea is dynamic select routes among {{a set of}} slowly changing alternative network paths. Our approach decou-ples the routing and load balancing problem into two distinct sub-problems: path creation and path selection. Paths are created through the reuse of classical 802. 1 Q multiple span-ning tree mechanisms. This guarantees that, for each <b>formed</b> <b>tree,</b> a path is deployed from each mesh node to the Mesh Gateway. Moreover, each tree (path) is assigned a Virtual LAN identifier. Path selection is driven by a local algorithm running at each mesh node, fed by measurements (taken along each path connecting the mesh node to the gateway) which allow to dynamically determine which are the best paths. In order to route a packet it is sufficient to mark the packet with the VLAN tag corresponding to the chosen path. The described approach provides a very general and flexible framework: performance/stability trade-offs can be tuned through the choice of i) the mechanism used to mea-sure the path quality; ii) the algorithm employed to select the path, and iii) the system parameter used (link costs and link weights) for the multiple spanning tree formation. 1...|$|E
40|$|In {{this opinion}} paper we {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} forest management on animal and plant biodiversity by comparing protected areas with intensively and extensively managed forests in Germany and in Romania. We {{want to know the}} extent to which differences in diversity of Romanian compared to German forests are based on management. The number of tree species was not different in protected and managed forests ranging between 1. 8 and 2. 6 species per plot in Germany and 1. 3 and 4. 0 in Romania. Also herbaceous species were independent of management, ranging between 13 species per plot in protected forests of Romania and 38 species per plot in German coniferous forest. Coarse woody debris was generally low, also in protected forests (14 to 39 m 3 ha − 1). The main difference between Romania and Germany was the volume of standing dead trees (9 to 28 m 3 ha − 1 for Romania), which resulted in larger numbers of forest relict saproxylic beetles independent of management. Large predators (wolves, bears and lynxes) are only found in regions with low human intervention. Thus, we identified a "cut and leave" type of management in Romania, in which clear-felling of forest are followed by long periods of no human intervention. Forests managed in the "cut and leave" mode contained the highest diversity, due to a natural succession of plant species and due to habitat continuity for animals. In Germany intensive management eliminates poorly <b>formed</b> <b>tree</b> individual and species of low market value during stand development. Forest protection does not ensure the maintenance of more light demanding key species of earlier stages of succession unless competition by shade-tolerant competitors is reduced through disturbances. We compare the economics of intensive and extensive management. The "cut and leave" mode delivers less wood to the wood market, but saves expenses of tending, thinning and administration. Thus the net income could be quite similar to intensive management at a higher level of biodiversity. Our analysis suggests that forest protection per se does not yet ensure the maintenance of species. Clear-felling followed by natural succession may even be superior to the protection of old growth forests, regarding biodiversity. Further research is needed to substantiate this hypothesis...|$|E

30|$|Nevertheless, {{the removal}} of poorly <b>formed</b> {{individual}} <b>trees</b> for biomass production, and removal of 64 % of the bole section of trees is likely to affect long-term availability of coarse wood material {{on the forest floor}} as observed in forests harvested for bioenergy supply for a period of over a decade in the United States of America (Briedis et al. 2011; Klockow et al. 2013). Under the current forest practice in Queensland, Australia, poorly <b>formed</b> individual <b>trees</b> not suitable for sawlog harvest, rotten heartwood or knotted or damaged large diameter sized sections of felled trees and the crown section deemed unsuitable for sawlog, provide necessary food and habitat for fauna species (Eyre et al. 2015) and fuelwood (West et al. 2008). Normally, when these poorly <b>formed</b> standing <b>trees</b> fall down they become part of the large coarse woody material on the forest floor (Eyre et al. 2015).
