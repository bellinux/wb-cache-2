5|$|The mixed {{woodland}} region is a dense forest with {{many species of}} trees, located near {{the tops of the}} plateaus. The forest canopy shades the ground, resulting in a cooler temperature. The canopy also reduces the amount of water evaporation. California black oak, Douglas fir, Pacific madrone, incense cedar, and other plants grow in the {{mixed woodland}}. Shrubs such as Oregon grape, honeysuckle, blue <b>elderberry,</b> and Pacific poison oak also grow here. The soil in this area is mostly loam.|$|E
5|$|In the {{traditional}} cottage garden, hedges served as fences {{on the perimeter}} to keep out marauding livestock and for privacy, along with other practical uses. Hawthorn leaves made a tasty snack or tea, while the flowers were used for making wine. The fast-growing <b>Elderberry,</b> in addition to creating a hedge, provided berries for food and wine, with the flowers being fried in batter or made into lotions and ointments. The wood had many uses, including toys, pegs, skewers, and fishing poles. Holly was another hedge plant, useful because it quickly spread and self-seeded. Privet was also a convenient and fast-growing hedge. Over time, more ornamental and less utilitarian plants became popular cottage garden hedges, including laurel, lilac, snowberry, japonica, and others.|$|E

5|$|The {{climate of}} Adams {{gives it a}} large amount of {{diversity}} within its forests. On the west side, down in the lower valleys, grand fir and Douglas fir dominate the forest with Western hemlock and Western red cedar as well. On the east side, Douglas fir and ponderosa pine are dominant with some patches of dense lodgepole pine. Western hemlock and Western red cedar also occur, but are limited to creek and river bottoms. Grand fir is present on sites with better moisture retention. At middle elevations on the west side, grand fir is increasingly replaced by Pacific silver fir and noble fir; and on the east side, lodgepole becomes much more prevalent. Above a certain elevation, lodgepole pine also appears in areas on the west side as well. As elevation increases further, the forest changes again with subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, and mountain hemlock becoming the dominant tree species on all sides of the mountain. Eventually, the last trees to disappear from the mountainside are the highly cold tolerant whitebark pine and mountain hemlock. Other conifers, 18 species in all, that play a lesser role than the dominant species are Western white pine, Sitka spruce, Western larch, Pacific yew, Alaska cedar, and mountain juniper. Adams is also home to many hardwoods as well including the tree species big leaf maple, Oregon white oak, quaking aspen, black cottonwood, and red alder. Large shrubs/small trees include the dwarf birch, Suksdorf’s hawthorn, California hazelnut, bitter cherry, vine maple, Douglas maple, and blue <b>elderberry</b> and contribute to a vibrant fall display.|$|E
25|$|Some {{riparian}} restoration efforts may {{be aimed}} at conserving particular animal species of concern, such as the Valley <b>elderberry</b> longhorn beetle in central California, which is dependent on a riparian tree species (blue <b>elderberry,</b> Sambucus mexicana) as its sole host plant. When restoration efforts target key species, consideration for individual species’ needs (e.g., minimum width or extent of riparian vegetation) are important for ensuring restoration success.|$|E
25|$|The company {{banned the}} use of <b>elderberry</b> juice and other adulterants, {{going so far as}} to mandate that all <b>elderberry</b> trees in the Douro be ripped out. The use of manure as {{fertilizer}} was prohibited, which served the benefit of limiting yields that would not only flood the market with over supply but also produce lower quality grapes. The Douro Wine Company further demarcated and classified the production of Port vineyards into two broad categories. The highest rated vineyards were designated as feitoria and were destined for the important British wine market and northern Europe. The remaining vineyards were designated as ramo and used for domestic consumption as well as export to the Portuguese colony of Brazil.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTwo novel highly {{basic type}} 1 (single chain) ribosome-inactivating {{proteins}} (RIPs) with N-glycosidase activity {{have been found}} in <b>elderberries</b> (the fruits of Sambucus nigra L.). Mass spectrometry of these RIPs, which we named nigritins f 1 and f 2, gave Mr values of 24   095 and 23   565, respectively. Both proteins strongly inhibited protein synthesis in rabbit reticulocyte lysates but were inactive against plant ribosomes. Both nigritins have a similar topological activity on pBlueScript SK+ DNA as that displayed by dianthin 30. Nigritin f 1 is a constitutive RIP since it is present in both green and mature intact <b>elderberries</b> at nearly the same proportion with respect to total fruit protein. By contrast, nigritin f 2 is inducible and only appeared in mature intact <b>elderberries.</b> <b>Elderberries</b> also contain two isoforms of a basic nigrin equivalent to the recently found basic nigrin b in elder bark (De Benito et al., FEBS Letters 413 (1997) 85 – 91). Our results indicate that probably not all plant RIPs exert the same biological function and that this may be determined by the physiological state of the tissue...|$|R

25|$|Yeast consumes {{the sugar}} in the grapes and {{converts}} it to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, {{as well as other}} aspects of wine production. Wines not made from grapes include rice wine and fruit wines such as plum, cherry, pomegranate and <b>elderberry.</b>|$|E

25|$|Fraud in wine {{production}} {{refers to the}} use of additives in order to deceive. This may include colouring agents such as <b>elderberry</b> juice, and flavourings such as cinnamon at best, or less desirable additives at worst. Some varieties of wine have sought after characteristics. For example some wines have a deep, dark color and flavor notes of spices due to the presence of various phenolic compounds found in the skin of the grapes. Fraudsters will use additives to artificially create these characteristics when they are lacking. Fraud in the selling of wine, has seen much attention focused on label fraud and the investment wine market. Counterfeit labelling of rare, expensive, and cult wines, and unregulated investment wine firms characterise this type of fraud. Wine Spectator noted as much as 5% of the wine sold in secondary markets could be counterfeit and the DTI (UK) believes losses (by investors) to rogue wine investment firms amount to hundreds of millions of pounds.|$|E
25|$|The British wine merchants {{used this}} {{opportunity}} to leverage their strength {{in order to maximize}} profits. In 1727, they grouped together to form a trade association and built the Factory House, a private gentlemen's club, where they could meet and collude on details pertaining to the wine trade. They bought all the wine from growers on credit, holding off payment till the wine was sold. They built large warehouses in Vila Nova de Gaia where they could keep the wine for years aging. Less than scrupulous shippers also committed widespread wine fraud by importing grapes from regions outside the Douro to blend, as well as adding non-grape based wine ingredients like <b>elderberry</b> juice for coloring and dried pimentos to add spicy flavors. These tactics increased the leverage of the British shippers and meant they could set whatever prices they wanted to pay the Portuguese grape growers. To ensure more fair pricing, the growers often had to resort to more unorthodox business dealings such as the prostitution of their daughters to the British shippers.|$|E

40|$|The {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} lipophilic extracts of three Portuguese <b>elderberries</b> cultivars belonging to the Sambucus nigra L. species ('Bastardeira', 'Sabugueira' and 'Sabugueiro'), was studied by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The influence of the harvesting season (2012 and 2013), cultivar and the ripening stage was evaluated. Regarding the amount of lipophilic extractives, they ranged from 0. 56 % to 1. 84 % of the dry weight. The major chemical families present in these fractions were triterpenoids and fatty acids accounting with 84. 9 - 93. 8 % and 4. 3 - 11. 4 % of {{the total amount of}} lipophilic components, respectively. The most abundant compounds, identified as <b>elderberries</b> components were ursolic and oleanolic acids, followed by smaller amounts of long chain aliphatic alcohols and sterols. During ripening, a similar profile of the studied chemical families was found for the two sampling seasons and the three cultivars, with an initial growth of their content followed by a systematic decrease until maturity, yet, a higher lipophilic content (p < 0. 05) is reported for the 2013 harvest. Regarding mature <b>elderberries,</b> 'Sabugueira' and 'Bastardeira' showed higher contents of lipophilics, and particularly of triterpenic acids (p < 0. 05), for the two sampling years. In-depth study of <b>elderberries,</b> lipophilic extractives can contribute to the valuation of this natural product, being in this study highlighted the profile of these bioactive compounds, as well, the parameters that affect their content. Additionally, since considerable amounts of unripe and overripe <b>elderberries</b> are produced on harvesting, and that our results showed considerable amounts oflipophilics for both ripening stages, this highlights that these wastes {{can be seen as a}} promising sources for the preparation of lipophilic extracts enriched in bioactive compounds.
