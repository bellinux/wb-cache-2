5|$|Another element <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> attack {{substitution}} {{that occasionally}} appears when a character's health is low. Similar features appear in later Final Fantasy titles under {{a variety of}} different names, including Limit Breaks, Desperation Moves, Trances, and Overdrives. Characters are rewarded for victorious battles with experience points and money, called gil (Gold Piece (GP) in the original North American localization). When characters attain a certain amount of experience points, they gain a level, which increases their statistics. An additional player may play during battle scenarios, with control of individual characters assigned from the configuration menu.|$|E
5|$|Because DNA {{collects}} mutations over time, {{which are}} then inherited, it contains historical information, and, by comparing DNA sequences, geneticists can infer the evolutionary history of organisms, their phylogeny. This field of phylogenetics <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> tool in evolutionary biology. If DNA sequences within a species are compared, population geneticists can learn the history of particular populations. This {{can be used in}} studies ranging from ecological genetics to anthropology; For example, DNA evidence is being used to try to identify the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin is used {{in cases}} of {{suspected}} toxic shock syndrome, often in combination with a bactericidal agent such as vancomycin. The rationale for this approach is a presumed synergy between vancomycin, which causes {{the death of the}} bacteria by breakdown of the cell wall, and clindamycin, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> inhibitor of toxin synthesis. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown clindamycin reduces the production of exotoxins by staphylococci; it may also induce changes in the surface structure of bacteria that make them more sensitive to immune system attack (opsonization and phagocytosis).|$|E

5|$|Episode Two {{featured}} a new Hunter enemy, which {{had just been}} seen briefly in a recorded message in Episode One. The Hunter serves {{as one of the}} most dangerous enemies within the game and as means of emotional development for Alyx Vance. The Hunter <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> and resilient enemy which players must often run from while seeking a means to fight back; Episode Twos environments are designed with this in mind.|$|E
5|$|In the Enchanted Forest, Red Riding Hood (Meghan Ory) brings {{supplies}} and news to her friend, Snow White (Ginnifer Goodwin). Prince Charming (Josh Dallas) {{is set to}} marry Abigail (Anastasia Griffith) in two days. Snow White wishes there were {{a way to get}} Charming out of her head as she is still in love with him. Red suggests she see Rumpelstiltskin (Robert Carlyle) and Snow takes her advice. Rumpelstiltskin takes some water and a piece of Snow's hair to make a potion that will make her forget Charming. He warns that love <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> disease and the cure must be extreme.|$|E
5|$|Melatonin <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> antioxidant. Melatonin easily crosses cell {{membranes}} and the blood–brain barrier. Unlike other antioxidants, melatonin does not undergo redox cycling, {{which is the}} ability of a molecule to undergo repeated reduction and oxidation. Redox cycling may allow other antioxidants (such as vitamin C) to act as pro-oxidants and promote free radical formation. Melatonin, once oxidized, cannot be reduced to its former state because it forms several stable end-products upon reacting with free radicals. Therefore, it has been referred to as a terminal (or suicidal) antioxidant.|$|E

5|$|Thayer's {{original}} argument, restated by Cott, {{was that}} nature did {{the exact opposite}} with countershading that an artist did with paint when creating the illusion of solid three-dimensionality, namely counteracting the effect of shade to flatten out form. Shading <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> cue used by animals in different phyla to identify the shapes of objects. Research with chicks showed that they preferred to peck at grains with shadows falling below them (as if illuminated from above), so both humans and birds may make use of shading as a depth cue.|$|E
5|$|The {{free zinc}} ion <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> Lewis acid {{up to the}} point of being corrosive. Stomach acid {{contains}} hydrochloric acid, in which metallic zinc dissolves readily to give corrosive zinc chloride. Swallowing a post-1982 American one cent piece (97.5% zinc) can cause damage to the stomach lining through the high solubility of the zinc ion in the acidic stomach.|$|E
5|$|The long-tailed {{ground roller}} is a shy and elusive bird and, if {{seen by a}} human observer, it either freezes or runs away. As its short wings suggest, the species rarely flies, but it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> runner. While largely terrestrial, it roosts in low trees and bushes, and sings from low perches. Long-tailed ground rollers are solitary outside the {{breeding}} season. Although diurnal, it does occasionally forage at night unlike most other ground rollers. When calling, this ground roller bobs its head and raises its tail. The long-tailed ground roller also raises its tail when it is excited.|$|E

5|$|The story also explores Balzac's {{conviction}} that a person's name <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> indicator {{of his or}} her destiny, an idea he drew from the work of Laurence Sterne. The title character, with his keen intellect, is based on Balzac's conception of himself: a visionary genius who fails to achieve his true potential because of less talented individuals with more social power.|$|E
5|$|With {{a minimum}} {{alveolar}} concentration (MAC) of 0.16%, methoxyflurane {{is an extremely}} potent anesthetic agent. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> analgesic agent at well below full anesthetic concentrations. Because of its low volatility and very high boiling point (104.8°C at 1atmosphere), methoxyflurane has a low vapor pressure at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. It is therefore quite difficult to vaporize methoxyflurane using conventional anesthetic vaporizers.|$|E
5|$|With the {{assistance}} of other characters revealed by audio chapters, the fictional protagonists break into a secure military installation and manage to deactivate a Forerunner device which is implied to begin the firing sequence of the Halo installations. However, the price paid for the deactivation <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> energy transmission alerting the Covenant {{to the location of}} Earth. Whole again, Melissa sees how she has been manipulated by the Pious Flea, and returns to her time. I Love Bees ends with the Covenant invading Earth, corresponding to a major plot point in Halo 2.|$|E

5|$|Fenix is a praetor {{within the}} {{military}} of the Khalai. Bill Roper voices Fenix in both StarCraft and Brood War. A templar and {{an old friend of}} Tassadar's, Fenix <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> and cunning leader, but remains distrustful towards the motives of the ruling judicator caste. Under the command of Aldaris, Fenix helps defend Aiur from the Zerg invasion, but eventually falls in the battle of Antioch when his position is overwhelmed by Zerg and his psi-blades lose power. Nevertheless, Fenix is retrieved and integrated into a dragoon, a mechanical fire support unit designed to allow incapacitated warriors to continue military service. Fenix allies his templar forces with Tassadar's upon the schism between Tassadar and the Protoss government, later leading a task force against the Overmind's outer defenses, facilitating Zeratul's assassination of a number of cerebrates and ultimately the death of the Overmind itself. Over this time, Fenix develops a strong friendship with Tassadar's Terran companion Jim Raynor.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> {{source of}} radio {{waves in the}} {{spectral}} region stretching from several kilohertz to tens of megahertz. Radio waves with frequencies of less than about 0.3MHz (and thus wavelengths longer than 1km) are called the Jovian kilometric radiation or KOM. Those with frequencies in the interval of 0.3–3MHz (with wavelengths of 100–1000m) are called the hectometric radiation or HOM, while emissions in the range 3–40MHz (with wavelengths of 10–100m) {{are referred to as}} the decametric radiation or DAM. The latter radiation was the first to be observed from Earth, and its approximately 10-hour periodicity helped to identify it as originating from Jupiter. The strongest part of decametric emission, which is related to Io and to the Io–Jupiter current system, is called Io-DAM.|$|E
5|$|The temple <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> {{symbol of}} Cambodia, {{and is a}} source of great {{national}} pride that has factored into Cambodia's diplomatic relations with France, the United States and its neighbour Thailand. A depiction of Angkor Wat {{has been a part of}} Cambodian national flags since the introduction of the first version circa 1863. From a larger historical and even transcultural perspective, however, the temple of Angkor Wat did not become a symbol of national pride sui generis but had been inscribed into a larger politico-cultural process of French-colonial heritage production in which the original temple site was presented in French colonial and universal exhibitions in Paris and Marseille between 1889 and 1937. Angkor Wat's aesthetics were also on display in the plaster cast museum of Louis Delaporte called musée Indo-chinois which existed in the Parisian Trocadero Palace from c.1880 to the mid-1920s.|$|E
