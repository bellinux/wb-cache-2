40|$|Quality of 20 {{fishmeal}} {{samples from}} the Southern Provinces produced by different raw materials and processing method were evaluated using both chemical and feed microscopy methods. Samples were collected from fishmeal plants, shrimp feed mills and local <b>feedstuff</b> <b>store.</b> One sample using sardine as a raw material was produced in the laboratory by lyophilization as a control fishmeal. Five samples having protein contents over 65 % were grouped into shrimp grade including the control fishmeal which had the maximum protein content of 74. 09 %. Eight samples were grouped into Grade 1 including the imported fishmeal from Chile. The rest of the samples which were mostly produced from trash fish fell into Grade 2 with low protein and high ash content. Chemical analyses of salt content, total volatile base nitrogen (TVN), ammonia nitrogen, histamine content, free fatty acid (FFA), thiobarbituric acid number (TBA) and peroxide value showed the fishmeal from <b>feedstuff</b> <b>store</b> was the most deteriorated sample. This high level of deterioration {{might be due to}} low quality raw materials and a long storage time. Among the shrimp grade samples, the most denatured protein was found in Pattani 1 with high level of TVN, ammonia nitrogen and histamine. Moreover, the high levels of TVN were detected in Phangnga 1 (grade 1) and Trang 2 (grade 2). Lipid damage was associated with high fat contents in fish meal which was detected in every group of the samples. The results from feed microscopic examination were in line with those of the chemical analyses. The most deteriorated sample from <b>feedstuff</b> <b>store</b> showed the highest decomposition level and was the only sample that non protein nitrogen was detected. For feather meal adulteration test, seven samples were positive with the highest level in unidentified sample and trace amount in other samples including 2 shrimp grade samples. To confirm feather meal adulteration, protein digestibility test should be performed for these samples...|$|E
40|$|The main {{difficulty}} in handling vitamin D supply, {{compared to the}} supply of the other fat-soluble vitamins, {{is that there are}} two sources of vitamin D: vitamin D supplied in the feed stuffs and vitamin D synthesized in the skin of the animals facilitated by irradiation by sunlight. The two sources supplement, but can also substitute, each other, which means that the need for supplemental vitamin D in the feedstuffs is low when production in the skin is high and vice versa (Harper, 1975). This supplementary action makes it difficult to get an overview of the actual need for providing vitamin D in the feedstuffs for dairy cows. The vitamin D status of dairy cows, as measured by vitamin D content in the produced milk, correlates closely with the amount of sunlight the cows are exposed to (Kurmann & Indyk, 1994) and in a temperate climate it is likely that animals with access to outside areas will have their needs for vitamin D covered through their own production during summer (Jensen, 2003). However, insecurity about the need for supplemental vitamin D during winter in Nordic countries still exists, since very {{little is known about the}} actual contents of vitamin D in <b>feedstuffs</b> <b>stored</b> for winter use, and cows ability to build up storages of vitamin D in liver and adipose tissue during exposure to sunlight. Vitamin D has two forms in which it can be taken up from the gastro intestinal tract of animals...|$|R
40|$|In the Himalayas, domesticated yak is fed at an altitudinal {{range of}} 3, 000 to 5, 000 m. Below this zone, the cow is more common. Hybrids are fed at an {{intermediate}} zone. In order {{to analyze the}} genetic basis of milk protein variation, milk samples {{were taken from the}} nak (female yak), cow and their hybrid. By principle component analysis, yak and a highland type of cow (kirmcome) were clearly distinguished from midland (shakzam) and lowland (palang) cows. Local Sherpa people may produce suitable animals for each zone by controlling animal reproduction systems. Generally speaking, a sustainable stocking rate is two adult animals per hectare in the central Himalayas. However, most pastures were overgrazed 3 to 10 times more than this level. The <b>feedstuff</b> <b>stored</b> over winter was half composed of hay and half of agricultural by-products such as rice straw and wheat straw. Grazing by animals provided 53 to 60 % of food intake (fresh plant weight). Ten % of fodder was provided by trees. For the total number of animals in this study region, the fodder shortage was very acute. Overpopulation of animals was estimated to be 31 to 73 %. Tree fodder is a typical feedstuff in this region. Popular fodder trees are Quercus, Symplocos and Castanopsis. Extention programmes are needed to increase tree fodder production and conserve soils. Ten years are needed to establish a system for continuous tree fodder production. One fodder tree can produce 14 kg fresh matter per year. The shortage can overcome by planting an additional 10 to 15 fodder trees per cow. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} on mycotoxins and mycotoxicoses is reviewed. It is stressed that strict {{proof of a}} mycotoxicosis depends on isolation of the toxin, proof {{that it is a}} fungal metabolite, and proof that it occurs in the feedstuffs in sufficient concentrations to cause the disease syndrome. The rational control of mycotoxicosis depends on a greater understanding of the ecology and physiology of toxigenic fungi in <b>stored</b> <b>feedstuffs.</b> The experimental studies are based on a holistic approach to establish the mycoflora of pasture hay and progress to a reductionist study of the effects of temperature and osmotic pressure on fungi isolated from hay. A critical assessment of some isolation techniques has demonstrated their inherent limitations and the need for a variety of isolation techniques to adequately characterize the mycoflora of pasture hay. A broad survey of the mycoflora of baled hay under natural storage conditions has established the variation in the mycoflora in space and time. The distribution of fungi was related to three principal components of the ecosystem of stored hay; namely temperature, osmotic pressure and time. Laboratory storage studies have shown a succession of fungi and other micro-organisms during the moist storage of hay by using both cultural techniques and direct observation with cellophane squares. Autecological studies on the fungi in hay have concentrated on the factors of temperature and osmotic pressure. An interaction between osmotic pressure and temperature was found such that at higher temperatures some fungi were able to grow on media with higher osmotic pressure.
