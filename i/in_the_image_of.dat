5|$|In 1994, the Pat Nixon Park was {{established}} in Cerritos, California. The site where her girlhood home stood is on the property. The Cerritos City Council voted in April 1996 to erect a statue of the former first lady, {{one of the few}} statues created <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> a first lady.|$|E
5|$|The {{theological}} {{concerns were}} twofold: first, putting {{man at the}} same level as monkeys or apes would lower the spiritually higher position that man was assumed to have in the great chain of being, and second, because the Bible says man was created <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> God (theomorphism), if monkeys/apes and humans were not distinctly and separately designed, that would mean monkeys and apes were created <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> God as well. This was something many could not accept. The conflict between world views that was caused by asserting man was a type of animal would simmer for a century until the much greater, and still ongoing, creation–evolution controversy began in earnest with the publication of On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin in 1859.|$|E

5|$|Although Christ, like man, is made <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> God, {{he alone}} shares the {{likeness}} of God the Father. Christ is both sinless and apathetic, and thus by striving to imitate Christ, man can achieve salvation. To Clement, sin is involuntary, and thus irrational , removed only through {{the wisdom of the}} Logos. God's guidance of us away from sin is thus a manifestation of God's universal love for mankind. The word play on λόγος and αλόγον is characteristic of Clement's writing, and may be rooted in the Epicurean belief that relationships between words are deeply reflective of relationships between the objects they signify.|$|E
5|$|Hick used Irenaeus' {{notion of}} {{two-stage}} creation {{and supported the}} belief that the second stage, being created into the likeness of God, is still in progress. He argued that to be created <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> God means to have the potential for knowledge of and a relationship with God; this is fulfilled when creation in the likeness of God is complete. Humanity currently exists <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> God and is being developed into spiritual maturity. Hick proposed that human morality is developed through the experience of evil and argued that it is possible for humans to know God, but only if they choose to out of their own free will. Hick acknowledges that some suffering seems to serve no constructive purpose and instead just damages the individual. Hick justifies this by appealing to the concept of mystery. He argues that, if suffering was always beneficial to humans, it would be impossible for humans to develop compassion or sympathy because we would know that someone who is suffering will certainly benefit from it. However, if {{there is an element of}} mystery to suffering, to the effect that some people suffer without benefit, it allows feelings of compassion and sympathy to emerge.|$|E
5|$|In Greek mythology, Auriga {{is often}} {{identified}} as the mythological Greek hero Erichthonius of Athens, the chthonic son of Hephaestus who was raised by the goddess Athena. Erichthonius was generally credited to be {{the inventor of the}} quadriga, the four-horse chariot, which he used in the battle against the usurper Amphictyon, the event that made Erichthonius the king of Athens. His chariot was created <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> the Sun's chariot, the reason Zeus placed him in the heavens. The Athenian hero then dedicated himself to Athena and, soon after, Zeus raised him into the night sky in honor of his ingenuity and heroic deeds.|$|E

30|$|The {{new power}} [in network society] lies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> codes <b>of</b> {{information}} and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> representation around which societies organize their institutions, and people build their lives, and decide their behavior (Castells 1997, 359).|$|R
50|$|Feininger {{became famous}} for his {{photographs}} of New York. Other frequent subjects among his works were science and nature, as seen in bones, shells, plants, and minerals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> which he often stressed their structure. Rarely did he photograph people or make portraits.|$|R
5|$|Nandanar {{entered the}} holy fire {{chanting}} {{the name of}} Shiva and reappeared in a new purified form. He looked like a Brahmin sage, wearing matted hair (characteristic of a Shaiva) and the sacred thread worn by Brahmins across his chest. His body was smeared with sacred ash. The gods showered flowers on the Nayanar from heaven and the Brahmins cheered. With the Brahmins, Nandanar went in the garbhagriha and saw Nataraja. The Nayanar disappeared <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> Nataraja and became one with Shiva.|$|E
5|$|The Platonic {{influence}} on Maximus' thought {{can be seen}} most clearly in his theological anthropology. Here, Maximus adopted the Platonic model of exitus-reditus (exit and return), teaching that humanity was made <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> God, {{and the purpose of}} salvation is to restore us to unity with God. This emphasis on divinization or theosis helped secure Maximus' place in Eastern theology, as these concepts have always held an important place in Eastern Christianity.|$|E
5|$|The {{forms of}} the glyphs are {{standardized}} contours of living organisms and geometric designs about one centimeter high. The wooden tablets are irregular in shape and, in many instances, fluted (tablets B, E, G, H, O, Q, and possibly T), with the glyphs carved in shallow channels running {{the length of the}} tablets, as can be seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> tablet G at right. It is thought that irregular and often blemished pieces of wood were used in their entirety rather than squared off due to the scarcity of wood on the island.|$|E

5|$|The next day, it {{was further}} {{revealed}} {{that not only}} Bruyneel stood to be forced from the team according to Vinokourov, but also Armstrong and other riders from the former Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team. The team would be built around Vinokourov and Contador, who {{would be able to}} choose which riders he wanted his teammates. It would contain almost exclusively Kazakhstani and Spanish riders, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> the former Liberty Seguros team, for which Contador previously rode. The matter was even addressed by the President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev. The new team organization would be in place by the Vuelta a España, which Vinokourov would ride.|$|E
5|$|The {{opposition}} to the ritual is not explicit in the oldest Upanishads. On occasions, the Upanishads extend {{the task of the}} Aranyakas by making the ritual allegorical and giving it a philosophical meaning. For example, the Brihadaranyaka interprets the practice of horse-sacrifice or ashvamedha allegorically. It states that the over-lordship of the earth may be acquired by sacrificing a horse. It then {{goes on to say that}} spiritual autonomy can only be achieved by renouncing the universe which is conceived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> a horse.|$|E
5|$|Choosing {{to support}} a Reason {{will result in a}} {{different}} ending depending on who is chosen, but in each the world is reborn <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> the chosen Reason after the Demi-fiend fights Kagutsuchi to prove his resolve. Chiaki and Isamu die before the Demi-fiend begins and give him their blessing in spirit form, while Hikawa accompanies the Demi-fiend into their new world. If Takao's wishes are followed, the Demi-fiend fights Kagutsuchi and the world is returned to its pre-Conception state, resurrecting and restoring all the main characters. If the Demi-fiend rejects Takao's wishes, Kagutsuchi curses him for allowing the world to die and departs, leaving the Demi-fiend as the only survivor in a barren world of demons, trapped as it is until another Conception can happen. If the Demi-fiend fulfills Lucifer's request of collecting the Candelabra from the Fiends, Kagutsuchi attacks him and is destroyed, breaking the Great Will's control over the worlds. After this, Lucifer fights the Demi-fiend to test his strength, then declares him to be the ultimate weapon in the upcoming war against the Great Will.|$|E

30|$|In vivo imaging using d-[18 F]FAC {{produced}} on ELIXYS and that {{produced by the}} UCLA Biomedical Cyclotron Facility in a manually operated apparatus [17] showed comparable images and uptake as expected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gastrointestinal tract (GI) and hematopoietic organs (Figure  8) [25]. Though {{there appears to be}} higher ‘noise’ (muscle uptake) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> mice injected with ELIXYS-produced d-[18 F]FAC, there is also higher ‘signal’ (organ uptake). Indeed, whole-body regions of interest excluding the tail showed that the total amount of activity was higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mice injected with the ELIXYS-produced tracer. We suspect {{that there may have been}} variations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> injections, e.g., more tracer left <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tail <b>in</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>images,</b> leading to a lower amount of activity in circulation. To remove these biases, organ uptake was normalized to a region of muscle tissue that showed no significant uptake.|$|R
5|$|Eliot invokes {{images of}} {{original}} sin and Adam's fall when talking about the past and points out that such events can be forgotten but can still affect mankind. Eliot brings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> Krishna to discuss how the past and future are related: Krishna, speaking to Arjuna, claims that death can come {{at any time and}} that men should always find the divine will instead of worrying about what their actions will bring. If an individual were to follow Krishna's words then {{they would be able to}} free their self from the limitations of time. Even if it cannot be fully attained, the effort in attempting it is still important. The way for mankind to understand the divine will is through prayer and through the power of the Holy Spirit.|$|E
5|$|Teachers of the {{doctrine}} focus on personal empowerment, promoting a positive view of the spirit and body. They maintain that Christians have been given power over creation because they are made <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> God and teach that positive confession allows Christians to exercise dominion over their souls and material objects around them. Leaders of the movement view the atonement as providing for the alleviation of sickness, poverty, and spiritual corruption; poverty and illness are cast as curses {{which can be broken}} by faith and righteous actions. There are, however, some prosperity churches which seek a more moderate or reformed paradigm of prosperity. Kirbyjon Caldwell, pastor of a Methodist mega-church, supports a theology of abundant life, teaching prosperity for the whole human being, which he sees as a path to combating poverty.|$|E
5|$|The Jana Sangh's {{first major}} campaign, begun in early 1953, centred on {{a demand for}} the {{complete}} integration of Jammu and Kashmir into India. Mookerjee was arrested in May 1953 for violating orders from the state government restraining him from entering Kashmir. He {{died of a heart}} attack the following month, while still in jail. Mauli Chandra Sharma was elected to succeed Mookerjee; however, he was forced out of power by the RSS activists within the party, and the leadership went instead to Upadhyaya. Upadhyay remained the General Secretary until 1967, and worked to build a committed grassroots organisation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> the RSS. The party minimised engagement with the public, focusing instead on building its network of propagandists. Upadhyaya also articulated the philosophy of integral humanism, which formed the official doctrine of the party. Younger leaders, such as Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Lal Krishna Advani also became involved with the leadership in this period, with Vajpayee succeeding Upadhyaya as president in 1968. The major themes on the party's agenda during this period were legislating a uniform civil code, banning cow slaughter and abolishing the special status given to Jammu and Kashmir.|$|E
30|$|Variations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sizes <b>of</b> <b>images</b> are {{significant}} in both natural vision (Section 7.2. 1) and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> processing <b>of</b> <b>images</b> by computers (Section 7.2. 2).|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> reconstructed <b>images</b> were {{analyzed}} using PMOD version 3.80 (PMOD Technologies Ltd, Switzerland). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> normal rats, volumes of interest (VOIs) were placed in each organ, and the radioactivity was expressed {{as the percentage of}} injected dose per gram (%ID/g). Time-activity curves (TACs) for the atrium, lung, liver, brain, spleen, kidney, and urinary bladder were obtained.|$|R

30|$|The goal {{of color}} {{classification}} is to detect segments <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> a sequence {{that are likely}} to belong to an elephant according to the trained color model. The emphasis of the color detector (as mentioned in Section 3.2) is primarily to maintain a high detection rate (no elephants should be missed), while a few false-positive detections are tolerated.|$|R
