50|$|Samuel Earnshaw {{was the one}} to {{discover}} in 1839 that “a charged body placed in an electrostatic field cannot levitate at stable equilibrium under the influence of electric forces alone”. Likewise, due to limitations on permittivity, stable suspension or levitation cannot be achieved in a static magnetic field with a system of permanent magnets or fixed current electromagnets. Braunbeck’s extension (1939) states that a system of permanent magnets must also contain <b>diamagnetic</b> <b>material</b> or a superconductor in order to obtain stable, static magnetic levitation or suspension.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diamagnetic</b> <b>materials</b> are {{excepted}} {{because they}} exhibit only repulsion against the magnetic field, whereas the theorem requires materials that have both repulsion and attraction. An {{example of this}} is the famous levitating frog (see diamagnetism).|$|R

50|$|PPV is a <b>diamagnetic</b> <b>material</b> {{and has a}} {{very low}} {{intrinsic}} electrical conductivity, {{on the order of}} 10-13 S/cm.1 The electrical conductivity increases upon doping with iodine, ferric chloride, alkali metals, or acids. However, the stability of these doped materials is relatively low. In general, unaligned, unsubstituted PPV presents only moderate conductivity with doping, ranging from <<10-3 S/cm (I2 doped) to 100 S/cm (H2SO4-doped).1 Draw ratios of up to 10 are possible. Alkoxy-substituted PPVs are generally easier to oxidize than the parent PPV and hence have much higher conductivities. Longer side chains lower the conductivity and hinder interchain hopping of charge carriers.|$|E
50|$|Electromagnetic based {{generators}} use Faraday's law of induction {{to convert}} the kinetic energy of the vibrations into electrical energy. They consist of magnets attached to a flexible membrane or cantilever beam and a coil. The vibrations cause {{the distance between the}} magnet and coil to change, causing a change in magnetic flux and resulting in an electromagnetic force being produced. Generally the coil is made using a <b>diamagnetic</b> <b>material</b> as these materials have weaker interactions with the magnet that would dampen the vibration. The main advantage of this type of generator is that it is able to produce more power than the piezoelectric generators.|$|E
5000|$|Diamagnetic materials, like water, or {{water-based}} materials, have {{a relative}} magnetic permeability {{that is less}} than or equal to 1, and therefore a magnetic susceptibility {{less than or equal}} to 0, since susceptibility is defined as χv [...] μv − 1. This means that diamagnetic materials are repelled by magnetic fields. However, since diamagnetism is such a weak property, its effects are not observable in everyday life. For example, the magnetic susceptibility of diamagnets such as water is χv [...] The most strongly <b>diamagnetic</b> <b>material</b> is bismuth, χv [...] , although pyrolytic carbon may have a susceptibility of χv [...] in one plane. Nevertheless, these values are orders of magnitude smaller than the magnetism exhibited by paramagnets and ferromagnets. Note that because χv is derived from the ratio of the internal magnetic field to the applied field, it is a dimensionless value.|$|E

50|$|Earnshaw's theorem has no {{exceptions}} for non-moving permanent ferromagnets. However, Earnshaw's theorem {{does not necessarily}} apply to moving ferromagnets, certain electromagnetic systems, pseudo-levitation and <b>diamagnetic</b> <b>materials.</b> These can thus seem to be exceptions, though in fact they exploit {{the constraints of the}} theorem.|$|R

5000|$|A {{very common}} source of {{magnetic}} field {{found in nature}} is a dipole, with a [...] "South pole" [...] and a [...] "North pole", terms {{dating back to the}} use of magnets as compasses, interacting with the Earth's magnetic field to indicate North and South on the globe. Since opposite ends of magnets are attracted, the north pole of a magnet is attracted to the south pole of another magnet. The Earth's North Magnetic Pole (currently in the Arctic Ocean, north of Canada) is physically a south pole, as it attracts the north pole of a compass.A magnetic field contains energy, and physical systems move toward configurations with lower energy. When <b>diamagnetic</b> <b>material</b> is placed in a magnetic field, a magnetic dipole tends to align itself in opposed polarity to that field, thereby lowering the net field strength. When ferromagnetic material is placed within a magnetic field, the magnetic dipoles align to the applied field, thus expanding the domain walls of the magnetic domains.|$|E
50|$|The rotor is {{stabilized}} {{in all of}} its {{six degrees}} of freedom. One degree is governed by the electric motor. Minimally, this degree must be stabilized electronically (or by a <b>diamagnetic</b> <b>material,</b> which is too unstable to be used in a precision pump bearing). Another way (ignoring losses in magnetic cores at high frequencies) is to construct this bearing as an axis with a sphere at each end. These spheres are inside hollow static spheres. On the surface of each sphere is a checkerboard pattern of inwards and outwards going magnetic field lines. As the checkerboard pattern of the static spheres is rotated, the rotor rotates. In this construction no axis is made stable on the cost of making another axis unstable, but all axes are neutral and the electronic regulation is less stressed and will be more dynamically stable. Hall effect sensors can be used to sense the rotational position and the other degrees of freedom can be measured capacitively.|$|E
50|$|The {{electromagnetic}} {{arrangement of}} a tape head is generally similar for all types, though the physical design varies considerably {{depending on the}} application - for example videocassette recorders (VCR) use rotating heads which implement a helical scan, whereas most audio recorders have fixed heads. A head consists of a core of magnetic material arranged into a doughnut shape or toroid, into which a very narrow gap has been let. This gap is filled with a <b>diamagnetic</b> <b>material,</b> such as gold. This forces the magnetic flux out of the gap into the magnetic tape medium more than air would (it also prevents the gap filling with rubbed off material from the tape which would have the reverse effect). The flux thus magnetises the tape at that point. A coil of wire wrapped around the core opposite the gap interfaces to the electrical side of the apparatus; thus either supplying a signal {{in the case of}} recording, or being fed to an amplifier in the case of playback. The basic head design is fully reversible - a variable magnetic field at the gap will induce an electric current in the coil, and an electric current in the coil will induce a magnetic field in the core and hence in the tape drawn across the gap.|$|E
50|$|Earnshaw's theorem proved {{conclusively}} {{that it is}} {{not possible}} to levitate stably using only static, macroscopic, paramagnetic fields. The forces acting on any paramagnetic object in any combinations of gravitational, electrostatic, and magnetostatic fields will make the object's position, at best, unstable along at least one axis, and it can be unstable equilibrium along all axes. However, several possibilities exist to make levitation viable, for example, the use of electronic stabilization or <b>diamagnetic</b> <b>materials</b> (since relative magnetic permeability is less than one); it can be shown that <b>diamagnetic</b> <b>materials</b> are stable along at least one axis, and can be stable along all axes. Conductors can have a relative permeability to alternating magnetic fields of below one, so some configurations using simple AC driven electromagnets are self stable.|$|R
50|$|In {{paramagnetic}} materials, {{the magnetic}} dipole moments of individual atoms spontaneously align with an externally applied magnetic field. In <b>diamagnetic</b> <b>materials,</b> {{on the other}} hand, the magnetic dipole moments of individual atoms spontaneously align oppositely to any externally applied magnetic field, even if it requires energy to do so.|$|R
50|$|Magnetic domains form in {{materials}} which have magnetic ordering; that is, their dipoles spontaneously align {{due to the}} exchange interaction. These are the ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic <b>materials.</b> Paramagnetic and <b>diamagnetic</b> <b>materials,</b> in which the dipoles align {{in response to an}} external field but do not spontaneously align, do not have magnetic domains.|$|R
40|$|Stable {{levitation}} of one magnet {{by another}} with no energy input is usually prohibited by Earnshaw’s Theorem. However, the intro-duction of <b>diamagnetic</b> <b>material</b> at special locations can stabilize such levitation. A magnet {{can even be}} stably suspended between (diamag-netic) fingertips. A very simple, surprisingly stable room temperature magnet levitation device is described that works without supercon-ductors and requires absolutely no energy input.

50|$|Few {{materials}} {{can be made}} to magnetically levitate stably above the magnetic field from a permanent magnet.
