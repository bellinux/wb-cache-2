5|$|Even as the Thirteenth Amendment {{was working}} <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> the {{ratification}} process, Republicans in Congress grew increasingly {{concerned about the}} potential for there to be a large increase in the congressional representation of the Democratic-dominated Southern states. Because the full population of freed slaves would be counted rather than three-fifths, the Southern states would dramatically increase their power in the population-based House of Representatives. Republicans hoped to offset this advantage by attracting and protecting votes of the newly enfranchised black population.|$|E

5|$|According to {{an article}} in the New Rochelle Pioneer the film was {{produced}} in New Rochelle and according to a news release the film was shot in the mountains during real blizzard weather. Bowers believes this film was shot during the winter and kept for its later June release. The winter of 1909 through 1910 contained two notable snow events that might have possibly been used in the production. A major snow storm from December 25 to December 26, 1909, would make <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> New York City with snow total of about 10 inches and wind gusts up to 58mph. A second major snow event occurred three weeks later, on January 14 through 15, 1910, with New York City getting 15 inches of snow. Another lesser snow event, deemed a blizzard in the press, was recorded in early February.|$|E

Turning west, the 29th took part in the assault on Brest which lasted from 25 August until 18 September. After a short rest, {{the division}} returned to XIX Corps and moved to defensive positions along the Teveren-Geilenkirchen line in Germany and maintained those positions through October. On 16 November, the division began its drive to the Roer River, blasting <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> Siersdorf, Setterich, Durboslar, and Bettendorf, and reaching the Roer {{by the end of the}} month. Heavy fighting reduced Jülich Sportplatz and the Hasenfeld Gut on 8 December.|$|E
5|$|At 1 p.m. on November 27, Peng {{ordered the}} PVA 66th Corps {{to destroy the}} ROK 1st Infantry Division before the Koreans could retreat to the Ch'ongch'on River. On the evening of November 27, the PVA 66th Corps {{launched}} a massive attack against the ROK 1st Infantry Division, the US 5th Regimental Combat Team of the 24th Infantry Division and the US 35th Infantry Regiment. After midnight, the Chinese attacks broke through the Korean lines and captured Yongsan-dong, resulting {{in the loss of}} the ROK 11th, 15th and US 35th Infantry Regiment's command posts. The ROK 11th and 15th Infantry Regiment were soon scattered while the retreating US 35th Infantry Regiment was blocked at Yongsan-dong with Chinese forces attacking from behind. Under heavy pressure, the US 35th Infantry Regiment fought <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> the town and rejoined the US 25th Division on the afternoon of November 28. At the same time, Paik rallied the broken ROK regiments and recaptured Yongsan-dong.

5|$|Earlier in {{the morning}} Dupont had {{proceeded}} with his column south and east along the river, from Marbach, according to instructions. Even {{before the arrival of}} Mortier's courier, he heard the sound of artillery in the distance and sent riders ahead to discover the cause. They came back to report that a Russian column (Dokhturov's) was descending from the mountains to take the road to Dürenstein. Realizing this would separate him from the forward division, Dupont hustled his troops toward the sound of battle and deployed them to take the Russians in the flank. The French assault, heralded by cannon fire, caused Dokhturov's troops to turn their attention from Gazan's beleaguered force to face these new assailants. Although superior in numbers, Dokhturov's column had no supporting artillery, and the narrow space prevented them from taking advantage of their size. It was Dokhturov's turn to face attackers at his front and rear, until the arrival of Schmitt's column, which wended <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> the mountains in the west.|$|E
5|$|McKnight {{remained}} at North Castle until John Morgan, the Director General, ordered him and Samuel Adams, Jr. (the son of Samuel Adams of Massachusetts) {{to set up}} a new hospital near Peekskill, New York, for more than 300 sick soldiers of General William Heath's division. Unable to find an acceptable site for a hospital, the two surgeons took over accommodations in Fishkill, New York, twenty miles north of Peekskill. Washington, however, sent convalescents to Peekskill because Morgan told him the hospital was there. Morgan was dismissed as Director General soon thereafter, in January 1777, due to rancor with Washington over supplies and a rampant smallpox epidemic then raging <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> the army. Morgan's management style rankled the surgeons, including McKnight, as Morgan was wrestling with Shippen, McKnight's mentor, over control of the hospitals in New Jersey. Isaac Foster took over temporary supervision of the hospitals {{on the east side of}} the Hudson River after Morgan's dismissal at Washington's request.|$|E

In Cold Spring, PA371 turns to the southeast through deep forests until an intersection with Township Roads 612 and 617. There, the forests break, and the route continues to the southeast. A short distance later, PA371 intersects with PA191 (Hancock Highway) in the community of Rileyville. There, the route begins to follow the alignment of the Newburgh and Cochecton Turnpike.

The 2nd Shock Army forced <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> to the German divisional headquarters and artillery positions. Only Kampfgruppe Rebane, stationed near Tartu, held their frontage, albeit with heavy losses. Army Detachment Narwa and XXVIII Corps, the northernmost elements of Army Group North, were at risk of getting encircled and destroyed.
