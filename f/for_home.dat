LEED <b>for</b> <b>Homes,</b> the NAHB Guidelines and the {{proposed}} Standard, are applicable <b>for</b> single family <b>homes.</b> Six of major divisions in both LEED and the NAHB Guidelines and Standard are very similar: LEED <b>for</b> <b>Homes</b> requires prerequisites {{with a minimum of}} points in some major divisions and minimum total points required for each designation. The NAHB Guidelines and the Standard have some general requirements and requires a minimum number of points for each major division for each designation level.

50|$|Today, {{increasing}} demand towards environmental safety forces LEED certification to play major role. The {{process of the}} LEED <b>for</b> <b>Homes</b> Rating System, available in the USA, Canada and Sweden, is {{significantly different from the}} LEED NC rating system. LEED <b>for</b> <b>Homes</b> projects are low rise residential and are required to work with either an American Provider Organization or a Canadian Provider Organization and a Green Rater. A Provider Organization helps the project through the process while overseeing the Green Raters. Green Raters are individuals that conduct the two mandatory LEED <b>for</b> <b>Homes</b> site inspections; the Thermal Bypass Inspection and the Final Inspection. Although LEED <b>for</b> <b>Homes</b> is typically viewed by the construction industry as a simpler rating system, especially when compared to LEED NC, LEED NC does not require an on-site inspection. The Provider and the Green Rater do not certify the project, but rather assist in the certification process.|$|R

5|$|Before {{a person}} can be {{detained}} under the ISA by the Minister <b>for</b> <b>Home</b> Affairs, the President must be satisfied that such detention {{is necessary for the}} purposes of national security or public order. In the landmark case of Chng Suan Tze v. Minister <b>for</b> <b>Home</b> Affairs (1988), the Court of Appeal sought to impose legal limits on the power of preventive detention by requiring the Government to adduce objective facts which justified the President's satisfaction. Two months after the decision, a series of legislative and constitutional amendments was enacted that effectively reversed the Chng Suan Tze decision. These amendments were subsequently confirmed to be valid by the High Court and Court of Appeal in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister <b>for</b> <b>Home</b> Affairs (1989–1990), which held it is sufficient for the President to be subjectively satisfied that a detainee is a threat to national security in order for a detention order to be issued under the ISA. Notable ISA cases include Operation Coldstore in 1963 which led to the arrest of some 100 left-wing politicians and trade unionists, including members of the socialist opposition party, the Barisan Sosialis. Chia Thye Poh, an alleged Communist, was detained and subject to other restrictions on his liberty under the ISA from 1966 to 1998. The Chng Suan Tze and Teo Soh Lung cases resulted from a 1987 security operation called Operation Spectrum in which 22 Roman Catholic church and social activists and professionals accused of being members of a Marxist conspiracy were detained under the ISA.|$|E

This is a precondition for the valid exercise by the Minister <b>for</b> <b>Home</b> Affairs of the power to order the detention. The detention order is supplemented by section 74 of the ISA which empowers the police to arrest and detain any person pending enquiries without a warrant under section 8.|$|E
