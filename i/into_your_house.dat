Section 2 provides that the occupier extend a [...] "common duty of care" [...] to all lawful visitors, although it keeps the low duty of care towards unlawful visitors such as trespassers. This duty is described as [...] "a duty to take such care as in all {{the circumstances of the}} case is reasonable to see that the visitor will be reasonably safe in using the premises for the purposes for which he is invited or permitted by the occupier to be there". The Act allows the occupier to set limits on where the visitor is allowed to go or how long they are allowed to be there, an extension of the common law judgment made by Scrutton LJ in The Calgarth , when he said that [...] "when you invite a person <b>into</b> <b>your</b> <b>house</b> to use the staircase, you do not invite him to slide down the bannisters, you invite him to use the staircase in the ordinary way in which it is used".|$|E

50|$|The main feud heading <b>into</b> In <b>Your</b> <b>House</b> 14 {{was between}} Stone Cold Steve Austin and Bret Hart. Their rivalry began in 1996 after Austin won the 1996 King of the Ring tournament and began taunting Hart, who was {{inactive}} at the time. Austin insulted Hart in his speeches so Hart could accept his challenge to a match. Hart returned in October and accepted Austin's challenge, {{with the two}} facing each other at Survivor Series where Hart defeated Austin. Their rivalry continued as Hart and Austin were the final two participants in the 1997 Royal Rumble match. Hart had originally eliminated Austin from the match but Austin's elimination was considered unofficial as the officials didn't see it because they were busy in a brawl between eliminated wrestlers Mankind and Terry Funk. They were participants in a Four Corners Elimination match for the vacant WWF Championship at In <b>Your</b> <b>House</b> 13: Final Four, which Hart won. The next night on Raw, Austin cost Hart the WWF Championship against Sycho Sid when Hart had applied the Sharpshooter on Sid, Austin nailed Hart with a steel chair followed by Sid powerbombing Hart for the win. Hart and Austin were booked to wrestle in a no disqualification submission match at WrestleMania, but Hart got {{a shot at the}} WWF Championship in a steel cage match on the March 17 edition of Raw Is War, with the winner defending the title against The Undertaker at WrestleMania 13. Hart had almost the match won, until Undertaker interfered and helped Sid in getting the victory. At WrestleMania 13, Hart faced Austin in a No Disqualification Submission match where he applied the Sharpshooter on Austin in the end of the match. Austin was heavily bleeding and passed out. Hart won the match but he did not release the hold. It resulted in a double turn, as Hart turned heel and Austin turned babyface. Hart then was booked to face Sid at In <b>Your</b> <b>House,</b> but during the April 7 episode of Raw Is War, Sid no-showed and Austin volunteered to face Sid's scheduled opponent, Mankind, if Austin faced Hart at In <b>Your</b> <b>House.</b> Hart then reformed the Hart Foundation by recruiting Owen Hart and The British Bulldog. Brian Pillman joined on April 21 and Jim Neidhart joined on April 28. The entire faction feuded with Austin.|$|R

50|$|As well as {{the annual}} King of the Ring tournament heading into the event, there were two other major feuds heading into the PPV. The main feud was between WWF Champion Diesel, Bam Bam Bigelow, Tatanka and Sycho Sid. The feud began after WrestleMania XI, and carried on <b>into</b> In <b>Your</b> <b>House</b> 1, where Diesel faced Sid for the WWF Championship. Diesel was set to retain the title after {{performing}} a Powerbomb on Sid, but Tatanka interfered and kayfabe attacked Diesel. This resulted in Diesel retaining the championship via disqualification. The following night, on the May 15 edition of Raw, Ted DiBiase (Sid's and the Million Dollar Corporation's manager) proposed that Diesel, along with Bigelow should face DiBiase's team of Sid and Tatanka. In the main event, Bigelow was set to face Irwin R. Schyster - accompanied by DiBiase - when Bigelow announced that Diesel would be ringside in his corner for the matchup. Diesel chased DiBiase {{in the early stages}} of the matchup, which Bigelow won via pinfall. DiBiase returned to the ring after the match with his enforcers Sid and Tatanka. On the May 22 edition of Raw, Shawn Michaels returned from a legitimate injury received from Sid on the April 3 edition of Raw. Michaels defeated King Kong Bundy, who had DiBiase in his corner throughout the contest. After the contest, Bigelow and Diesel came out to congratulate Michaels on the victory. During this feud, Diesel suffered a legitimate elbow injury, but was able to compete at King of the Ring. To explain the injury, footage was shown on the May 29 edition of Raw of Sid performing a Chokeslam and Powerbomb onto Diesel at In <b>Your</b> <b>House</b> 1. Because of Diesel's injury, this storyline never got any further buildup until the actual pay-per-view.|$|R
