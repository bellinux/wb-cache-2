40|$|Objective: {{to study}} a trend in the {{development}} of the infectious process caused by cultivable and non cultivable bacteria in Chinchilla rabbits with burn disease.   Materials and methods. The investigators examined 64 rabbits subcutaneously infected with cultivable and non cultivable Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus at a dose of 10 5 microbial cells in the presence of burn injury in experimental groups and in two similar control groups of animals without thermal injury. Rabbits were exposed to IIIAB degree burn injury under anesthesia. The non cultivable bacteria were obtained by the procedure proposed by L. B. Kozlov et al., by applying a refrigerated <b>heating</b> <b>circulator.</b> The trend {{in the development of}} the infectious process was observed during 21 days. Dead animals were dissected; bacterial concentrations were estimated in their viscera and abnormal changes were determined in the histological specimens. The results of the investigations were statistically processed according to STATISTICA 6. 0 using the mean arithmetic error (М±m). Differences were statistically evaluated by Student’s t test and the Mann Whitney test. A correlation analysis was made applying the software package Microsoft Excel 97 for IBM PC to compute correlation coefficients and their errors.   Results. The cultivable bacteria in the animals with burn injury induced an infectious process in their viscera to develop sepsis on days 8 — 12 of the disease with a fatal outcome and the non cultivable bacteria in those with burn disease caused death due to brain injury on days 2 — 3, with P. aeruginosa isolated from brain tissue.   Conclusion. Both the cultivable and non cultivable bacteria had significant effects in Chinchilla rabbits with burn disease. Non cultivable P. aeruginosa had a tropism for nerve tissue, which was not found in the cul tivable bacteria.   </p...|$|R

40|$|Reverse osmosis (RO) is a {{well-known}} process for desalinating seawater and brackish groundwater. Desalination is energy-intensive, so using photovoltaic (PV) panels to power the process is an attractive environmentally friendly concept, especially for community-scale systems. Increasing the system efficiency will lower {{the total cost of}} water produced, making the systems more economically competitive for a greater number of geographic locations. The thermal behaviors of PV panels and RO systems are complementary and can be exploited to improve photovoltaic reverse osmosis (PVRO) system efficiency. For a given level of solar radiation, a PV panel produces more electrical power at lower panel temperatures. For a given applied pressure, the flow of clean water across an RO membrane increases with increasing temperature. By using the RO feed water to cool the PV panels and warming the water in the process, more electrical power can be produced and higher flow rates of clean water across the RO membrane can be achieved, increasing total daily water production. The ability to cool the PV panels permits the use of low-cost, flat-plate concentrating mirrors, which further increase electrical power and clean water production. This thesis develops a thermal management system to improve the performance of a small-scale PVRO. Preliminary case studies show that the thermal exploitation concept is feasible and that a 50 % increase in the total daily clean water production of a PVRO system is achievable, with an active thermal controller. A thermal controller is proposed that optimizes the PVRO system performance by minimizing the temperature of the solar panel and maximizing the temperature of the RO feed water. The control system uses a solar panel-mounted <b>heat</b> exchanger, <b>circulator</b> pump and servo valves to maximize water production while operating within the temperature limits of both the solar panel and the reverse osmosis membrane. Preliminary controller simulations show that it can successfully manage the temperatures of both the solar panel and RO feed water. The thermal management concept was experimentally validated on a small-scale, 300 L/day PVRO system. A 57 % increase in clean water production was achieved using thermal management and solar concentrating mirrors, which agrees well with simulated performance predictions. by Leah C. Kelley.

40|$|This report {{deals with}} the thermal-hydraulic {{analysis}} of the helium-cooled pebble bed (HCPB) test blanket module (TBM) to be tested in the international thermonuclear experimental reactor (ITER). It represents a poloidal section of the corresponding European blanket concept being developed at FZK in collaboration with other European research organizations for a DEMO reactor. This concept employs alternating layers of ceramic breeder material and beryllium as multiplier, which are separated by radial-toroidal cooling plates. The analysis is performed with the computer code RELAP/MOD 3. 1 which is one-dimensional {{in terms of the}} fluid dynamics but permits heat transfer across flow channel walls. Thus, modeling of the complex cooling flow pattern present in the TBM, in combination with the time-dependent volumetric heat as well as surface heat flux applied to the first wall, is described in detail. The model includes also the complete cooling circuit with <b>circulator,</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger, pressure and temperature control provisions, and the coupling to the secondary cooling system. The performance of the TBM and cooling circuit during normal operation (i. e., steady state and pulsed operation) and accidents was investigated. Four accident families were analysed with a variety of input parameters: (1) loss of flow accidents, (2) loss of coolant accidents, (3) leak inside test module accidents; and (4) loss of heat sink accidents. Typical transients for pressure, temperature, velocity, and mass flow rate at various locations in the TBM and in the circuit are presented and discussed in terms of safety aspects. Overall, no critical safety issues were identified. (orig.) 17 refs.

40|$|Synthetic organic dyes {{comprise}} {{a significant part}} of industrial water effluents, as they are discharged in abundance by many manufacturing industries (e. g. textile industries). The potential carcinogenic properties of these dyes render their safe disposal a major environmental concern. The colored wastewater {{in the presence of the}} aforementioned dyes is a major cause of eutrophication and production of hazardous byproducts through processes such as oxidation, hydrolysis, or other chemical reactions taking place in the wastewater phase. The colored wastewater release in the ecosystem may also block both sunlight penetration and oxygen dissolution, which are essential for energy intake and the preservation of aquatic life. Thus there is a dire need to treat these colored effluents before discharging them into various water bodies. For the safe removal of dye pollutants, traditional physical techniques (adsorption on activated carbon, ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis, coagulation by chemical agents, ion exchange on synthetic adsorbent resins, etc.) can generally be used efficiently. Nevertheless, they are non-destructive for the pollutant, since they merely transfer the organic compounds from liquid to another phase, thus causing secondary pollution. Consequently, costly regeneration of adsorbent materials and post-treatment of solid-wastes, which are expensive operations, are mandated. Due to the large degree of aromatics present in dye molecules and the stability of modern dyes, conventional biological treatment methods (Cyclic Activated Sludge System) are ineffective for decolorization and degradation. Lately, Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs), such as photochemical processes, Fenton, photo-Fenton, Fenton-like, ozonation and photocatalysis, are being applied to treat dye effluents with encouraging results. AOPs were based on the generation of very reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals (•OH), that oxidize a broad range of pollutants quickly and non-selectively. Among AOPs, heterogeneous photocatalysis appears as the most promising pollutant destructive technology. Heterogeneous photocatalytic processes involve irradiation–usually UV-A (λ= 320 – 400 nm) or solar irradiation, in the presence of a semiconductor acting as a catalyst for the production of free hydroxyl radicals. The basic mechanism for generating •ΟΗ involves the adsorption of a photon, the generation of an electron-hole pair (e_cb^-+ h_vb^+) and subsequently the production of •ΟΗ. The photo-generation of a hole-electron pair is a reversible process and it can therefore correspondingly diminish the rate of •ΟΗ production. The generated electrons react with adsorbed oxygen and this inhibits the recombination step. In the absence of a surface e- acceptor species recombination of the hole-electron pair proceeds very fast. The photogenerated holes can oxidize the organic molecule to form R+, or react with OH− or H 2 O, thus oxidizing them into •OH radicals. Together with other highly oxidant species (peroxide radicals) they are reported in the literature to be responsible for the heterogeneous photodecomposition of organic substrates as dyes. Considering efficient photocatalysts, nanometric commercial Titania (Degussa P 25), is one of the most promising materials due to its potent photocatalytic properties. However, it strongly suffers from a low photocatalytic activity when employed under visible light, while also exhibiting a positive correlation with the appearance of human lung cancer, attributed to the presence of respirable, nano-sized particles. To overcome these problems, new materials need to be produced and tested for their photocatalytic properties. Utilizing high energy ultrasounds (US), in order to modify the surface of a ceramic substrate with metallic nanoparticles, is considered an easy, fast and effective approach for synthesizing photocatalysts and increase their photocatalytic potential in the visible range. In the present thesis, a sonochemical procedure exploiting high energy ultrasounds was used in order to obtain decoration (10 % W/W) of Ag metallic nanoparticles (NPs) on the surface of commercial micrometric Titania Kronos 1077 (100 % anatase, average crystallite size: 110 nm, Eg= 3. 2 eV). To investigate the photocatalytic activity of the prepared sample the molecule of Methylene Blue dye was used. A parametric study of the photocatalytic oxidation was carried out, accounting for variable pH and amount of employed catalyst. Tests were conducted both under UV-A light and artificial visible light. To ensure the decoration of silver NPs on the titanium dioxide substrate two different solutions were prepared. The first solution (A) contains the silver precursor AgNO 3 (Sigma Aldrich, 99. 0 %), PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidone, Sigma Aldrich, 99. 0 %), TiO 2 Kronos 1077 and dist. H 2 O. The second solution (B) contains NaBH 4 (Sigma Aldrich, 99. 0 %) and dist. H 2 O. First, solution A was treated by US generated using a VCX 750 by SONICS®, utilizing a 200 W US generator and a sonication extension horn (US frequency: 20 kHz) of 13 mm diameter and maintaining the temperature at 30 ◦C using a <b>heating</b> <b>circulator</b> for 10 minutes with 33. 0 % amplitude and an intensity of 30 Wcm− 2. Without stopping sonication, solution B was then mixed with solution A and sonication continued for one hour. The presence of NaBH 4 acts as a reducing agent on the silver precursor molecules while PVP, which acts as a surfactant, plays a crucial role on the morphology and size of the final product. Ultrasound is fundamental for both the formation of NPs from the precursor and for their optimal distribution on the TiO 2 support surface. Indeed, ultrasonic irradiation speeds up the diffusion of solute in the reaction system, as well as influences the selective adsorption of the surfactant on silver, thus inducing elongation or compression in defined directions, affecting the particles morphology. Moreover, the use of US allows working in conditions that do not require high temperatures and thus they are not energy intensive. Finally, the sonicated mixture is centrifuged in order to remove the solvent and it is then washed with dist. water. After centrifugation, the obtained slurry mixture was put in an oven for two hours at 400 ◦C. XRD analysis of the modified sample showed that surface decoration does not affect the structural properties of Kronos 1077. The XRD pattern exhibits the peaks characteristic of the anatase phase [ICDD anatase file no. 21 - 1272]. The TEM analysis of bare Kronos 1077 shows that it is characterized by an average crystallites dimensions lying in the 100 – 150 nm range. Respectively, the decorated sample exhibits the main morphological features typical of the parent Kronos system, with an average Ag nanoparticle size on the Kronos surface lying in the 10 – 30 nm range. In order to test the photocalytic properties of the prepared sample, compared to the bare one, and examine certain parameters that effect the degradation of Methylene Blue molecule (pH, catalyst loading), a photocalytic apparatus was designed and build in the lab. The experiments were carried out in a glass vessel of 120 ml, transparent to UV-A irradiation. A total of 6 lamps, 11 W each, were placed above the vessel either for UV-A (PL-S 11 W/ 10 / 2 P 1 CT, λmax= 365 nm) or for VL, (PL-S 11 W/ 865 / 2 P 1 CT, λmax= 545 nm) irradiation. Since dyes are colored in nature, it is straightforward to monitor their color change during the course of the experiment. In photocatalytic studies, the sample is typically exposed to UV or VL irradiation for a given time period and the changes in solution property (such as color) are observed by a spectrophotometer. To monitor the photodegradation of the dye a sample of the solution after irradiation is transferred to a cuvette and subjected to absorption studies on a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (U- 5100 Hitachi). The degree of decoloration (τ) is then calculated from the decrease of absorbance of the dye solution at its maximum absorption wavelength as follows: τ=[1 -A_i/A_ 0]× 100 where, A 0 and Ai are the absorbance values of the dye solution, before and after irradiation respectively. After each measurement the sample is returned back to the glass vessel. The MB removal was studied by monitoring the degradation of the MB dye in an aqueous solution (100 ml, 2 × 10 - 5 M), under continuous stirring and exposure to UV-A light irradiation or visible light (VL). The characteristic absorption at 663 nm was used to determine the MB concentration. In the experiments regarding the photodegradation efficiency of MB, as affected by the initial pH of the solution, the catalyst loading was kept constant at 2 mg and pH varied from the natural pH at 5. 8 to 4 and 2. Respectively, the experiments regarding the catalyst loading, the pH of the suspension was fixed and kept constant at pH value 4 and the catalyst loading varied between 1, 2 and 3 mg [...] Before starting each experiment the prepared suspension was put in an ultrasonic bath for 30 minutes under dark conditions to ensure the best possible distribution of the catalysts particles in the solution and a maximum absorption of the dye molecules onto the catalyst surface. A benchmark absorption spectrum, before irradiation, was obtained. Subsequently, the lamps were turned on and the experiments lasted for one hour of illumination, taking measurements of the absorption spectra at specific time intervals during the illumination process. The photocatalytic studies under different pH solutions showed that at lower pH values the photocatalytic oxidation is enhanced. The variation in solution pH changes the surface charge of TiO 2 particles and shifts the potentials of the catalytic reactions taking place. The surface of Titania will remain positively charged in an acidic medium and negatively charged in an alkaline medium because of protonation or deprotonation respectively. Therefore as the pH|$|R
