5|$|Bowers {{does not}} cite any trade {{publication}} reviews for this film, making <b>it</b> <b>unlikely</b> {{that the film}} was given attention in The New York Dramatic Mirror, The Moving Picture World or The Moving Picture News publications. The film was apparently a success at the Province Theater when it was shown in Vancouver. It is possible that non-advertisement reviews of the film may exist in other publications.|$|E
5|$|In 2004 Lü {{and colleagues}} {{proposed}} that the articulation between the quadrate and quadratojugal bones in the skull of Nemegtomaia suggested that these bones were movable in relation to each other, which would have affected how the jaws functioned. In 2015 Christophe Hendrickx and colleagues found <b>it</b> <b>unlikely</b> that Nemegtomaia and other oviraptords had bird-like kinesis in their skulls, due to the quadrate bone being immobile.|$|E
5|$|The {{great variety}} of forms makes <b>it</b> <b>unlikely</b> that the modern form is the most ancient one, and the words on which the {{interpretation}} are based are not found {{in many of the}} earliest records of the rhyme (see above).|$|E

5|$|When {{the park}} was proclaimed, land zoning {{regulations}} allowed existing mining prospecting rights to continue. These rights were restricted to previously mined areas; this coupled with further restrictions imposed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service Act (1972) make <b>it</b> <b>unlikely</b> that mining will occur in the future.|$|E
5|$|After Belushi's wife Judy and Aykroyd had a {{talk with}} Belushi about his antics, the {{production}} returned to Los Angeles. Filming there again ran smoothly, until {{it came time to}} shoot the final sequence at the Hollywood Palladium. Just beforehand, Belushi fell off a borrowed skateboard and seriously injured his knee, making <b>it</b> <b>unlikely</b> he could go through with the scene, which required him to sing, dance, and do cartwheels. Wasserman persuaded the city's top orthopedic surgeon to postpone his weekend plans long enough to stop by and sufficiently anesthetize Belushi's knee, and the scene was filmed as intended.|$|E
5|$|After {{shearing}} ewes {{are typically}} placed in well sheltered paddocks that have good feed and water. Attention to ewes that are lambing {{varies according to}} the breed, size and locations of properties. Unless they are stud ewes <b>it</b> <b>unlikely</b> that they will receive intensive care. On stations with large paddocks there is a policy of non-interference. On other properties the mobs are inspected by stockmen at varying intervals to stand cast ewes and deal with dystocia. Producers also sometimes quietly drift pregnant ewes away from ewes that have already lambed, {{in order to prevent}} mis-mothering.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the musical}} project's complex structure, Folkearth has not {{performed}} live, and <b>it's</b> <b>unlikely</b> they will perform live in the future.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to his pitching, Hultzen is considered an excellent position player, although <b>it's</b> <b>unlikely</b> that he'll ever be developed as a position prospect.|$|R
50|$|Like most DC Thomson characters, Minnie's {{parents are}} never {{mentioned}} by name; and {{are referred to}} simply as Minnie's dad and Minnie's mum. However, in issue 2258 (dated 26 October 1985), her dad reveals that his name is 'Victor'. <b>It</b> is <b>unlikely</b> this is any kind of official name, however. In the Beano Videostars it is said by his Boss Minnie's Dad's name is George, but once again <b>it's</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>it's</b> an official name.|$|R
5|$|Gian Gastone {{arrived in}} Tuscany, without his wife, in 1708. The Emperor, {{thinking}} <b>it</b> <b>unlikely</b> that any male heirs {{were to be}} born to the Medici, prepared to occupy Tuscany, under the pretext of Medici descent. He intimated that upon the Grand Prince's death the Tuscans would rebel against Cosimo's autocratic government. Cosimo, {{in an act of}} desperation, had Francesco Maria, the Medici family cardinal, renounce his religious vows and marry Eleanor of Gonzaga, the youngest child of the incumbent Duke of Guastalla. Two years later, Francesco Maria died, taking with him any hope of an heir.|$|E
5|$|In the White Sea {{region of}} Russia, all three {{assemblage}} types {{have been found}} in close proximity. This, and the faunas' considerable temporal overlap, makes <b>it</b> <b>unlikely</b> that they represent evolutionary stages or temporally distinct communities. Since they are globally distributed – described on all continents except Antarctica – geographical boundaries {{do not appear to be}} a factor; the same fossils are found at all palaeolatitudes (the latitude where the fossil was created, accounting for continental drift) and in separate sedimentary basins.|$|E
5|$|King County police, finally {{armed with}} a {{detailed}} description of their suspect as well as his car, posted fliers throughout the Seattle area. A composite sketch was printed in regional newspapers and broadcast on local television stations. Elizabeth Kloepfer, Ann Rule, a DES employee, and a UW psychology professor all recognized the profile, the sketch, and the car, and reported Bundy as a possible suspect; but detectives—who were receiving up to 200 tips per day—thought <b>it</b> <b>unlikely</b> that a clean-cut law student with no adult criminal record could be the perpetrator.|$|E
25|$|Battery 628 {{was ordered}} disbanded on 11 April and its {{personnel}} incorporated into Battery 428, although <b>it's</b> <b>unlikely</b> that either unit actually saw action except in local defense.|$|R
5000|$|Fortune called PSFK a [...] "21st-century re-boot" [...] of McKinsey & Company. However, [...] "despite its {{impressive}} client {{list and}} growing capabilities <b>it's</b> <b>unlikely</b> that PSFK will threaten McKinsey".|$|R

5|$|The known {{range of}} Boletopsis nothofagi {{is limited to}} two {{narrowly}} defined areas of New Zealand, one on the North Island {{and the other on}} the South Island. These areas are in Rimutaka Forest Park near Wellington, and Saint Arnaud {{in the northern part of}} the South Island. These locations are relatively far away from each other and isolated, which, together with its absence in the rest of New Zealand, makes <b>it</b> <b>unlikely</b> that the species is a recent import. It is more likely that the species is native to New Zealand and has been overlooked in earlier surveys due to its rarity.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, Edward and Gaveston {{may have}} simply been {{friends with a}} close working relationship. Contemporary chronicler {{comments}} are vaguely worded; Orleton's allegations were {{at least in part}} politically motivated, and are very similar to the highly politicised sodomy allegations made against Pope Boniface VIII and the Knights Templar in 1303 and 1308 respectively. Later accounts by chroniclers of Edward's activities may trace back to Orleton's original allegations, and were certainly adversely coloured by the events at the end of Edward's reign. Such historians as Michael Prestwich and Seymour Phillips have argued that the public nature of the English royal court would have made <b>it</b> <b>unlikely</b> that any homosexual affairs would have remained discreet; neither the contemporary Church, Edward's father nor his father-in-law appear to have made any adverse comments about Edward's sexual behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Dawson relayed {{this story}} to Bulawayo, where Company {{authorities}} made enquiries. No {{man who had been}} attached to the column corroborated the account. The Company thought <b>it</b> <b>unlikely</b> that a Matabele inDuna would simply invent a story such as this, however, and angrily speculated that if it were true, then negotiations with Lobengula might have been opened and the war ended before Wilson crossed the river, and the entire episode of the Shangani Patrol avoided (though, as historian Robert Cary writes, this surmision ignores the fact that Forbes had been ordered to capture Lobengula, not end the war). Lawyers appointed by the Company launched a formal investigation early in 1894.|$|E
50|$|However {{the film}} {{appears to have}} only been given a small release and <b>it</b> is <b>unlikely</b> <b>it</b> was a {{commercial}} success.|$|R
50|$|At the 2016 Q awards, Bellamy {{said that}} they might release a song or two in 2017 but <b>it's</b> <b>unlikely</b> that a new album would come out that year, more likely in 2018.|$|R
50|$|According to Howard Eissenstat, a Turkey {{expert at}} St Lawrence University in New York, the TAK is {{damaging}} the PKK's short-term and long-term goals, and <b>it's</b> <b>unlikely</b> that the TAK is under PKK control.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{cash from}} Rothschild, {{the company could}} not raise {{sufficient}} investment to begin construction of the Oxford extension, and had only been given a five-year window by Parliament in which to build it. On 7 August 1888, {{less than two weeks}} before the authorisation was to expire, the directors of the Oxford, Aylesbury and Metropolitan Junction Railway Company received Royal Assent for a revised and cheaper version. To be called the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad (O), the new scheme envisaged the extension's being built to the same light specifications as the existing tramway. To avoid expensive earthworks and tunnelling, the line would parallel a road out of Brill, despite the considerable gradients involved. The entire route would be single track, other than passing places, and the Oxford terminus was to be in George Street, nearer the edge of the city. Jones was sceptical and felt that <b>it</b> <b>unlikely</b> to recoup its construction costs.|$|E
5|$|Footprints {{from the}} Nemegt Formation were unknown until 2003, when Currie and colleagues {{described}} several {{examples from the}} Nemegt locality. Most of these footprints belonged to hadrosaurids (probably Saurolophus), while two have been left by a large theropod (probably Tarbosaurus) and yet another two by the hindfoot of a sauropod. The sauropod tracks were assigned to Opisthocoelicaudia, which showed a matching hind foot morphology. The researchers argued that Opisthocoelicaudia was probably the only known sauropod from the Nemegt Formation when Nemegtosaurus is regarded a synonym, making <b>it</b> <b>unlikely</b> that the tracks were left by another, similar titanosaur. The tracks were left in the soft and wet mud of shallow or freshly dried up points along a river and subsequently filled up with sand. Today only the sand infill remains, with the encasing mudstone having been eroded away.|$|E
5|$|Historian Samuel E. Morison {{noted in}} 1949 that Spruance was {{subjected}} to much criticism for not pursuing the retreating Japanese, thus allowing their surface fleet to escape. Clay Blair argued in 1975 that had Spruance pressed on, {{he would have been}} unable to launch his aircraft after nightfall, and his cruisers would have been overwhelmed by Yamamoto's powerful surface units, including Yamato. Furthermore, the American air groups had suffered considerable losses, including most of their torpedo bombers. This made <b>it</b> <b>unlikely</b> that they would be effective in an airstrike against the Japanese battleships, even if they had managed to catch them during daytime. Also, by this time Spruance's destroyers were critically low on fuel.|$|E

50|$|The song {{describes}} the common phenomenon of a quarrel between lovers, {{and although the}} song's title seems to be self-contradictory, <b>it's</b> <b>unlikely</b> that <b>it</b> pertains to a sexual double entendre as some have believed it to be.|$|R

5|$|Hugh {{was the son}} of Edward of Wells and {{elder brother}} of Jocelin of Wells, Bishop of Bath. Hugh's year of birth is unknown, but he was {{probably}} an old man at his death in 1235. The fact that he never left his residence from March 1233 until his death implies that he was impaired from old age. He first appears as a witness on documents of Reginald fitzJocelin, the Bishop of Bath in the late 1180s. After fitzJocelin's death in 1191, Hugh continued {{in the service of the}} next bishop, Savaric FitzGeldewin. By the end of the 1190s, Hugh was a canon of Wells Cathedral. Although Hugh's brother Jocelin was given the title of magister, implying that he attended a university, Hugh is never called magister, making <b>it</b> <b>unlikely</b> that he ever received much schooling.|$|E
5|$|In her legend, Haumea's many {{children}} came from {{different parts of}} her body. The dwarf planet Haumea appears to be almost entirely made of rock, with only a superficial layer of ice; most of the original icy mantle is thought to have been blasted off by the impact that spun Haumea into its current high speed of rotation, where the material formed into the small Kuiper belt objects in Haumea's collisional family. There could therefore be additional outer moons, smaller than Namaka, that have not yet been detected. However, HST observations have confirmed that no other moons brighter than 0.25% of the brightness of Haumea exist within the closest tenth of the distance (0.1% of the volume) where they could be held by Haumea's gravitational influence (its Hill sphere). This makes <b>it</b> <b>unlikely</b> that any more exist.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of the {{eleventh}} century BC, Mari became part of Hana whose king Tukulti-Mer took the title king of Mari and rebelled against Assyria, causing the Assyrian king Ashur-bel-kala to attack the city. Mari came firmly under the authority of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, and was assigned {{in the first half of}} the 8th century BC to a certain Nergal-Erish to govern under the authority of king Adad-Nirari III (reigned 810–783 BC). In c. 760 BC, Shamash-Risha-Usur, an autonomous governor ruling parts of the upper middle Euphrates under the nominal authority of Ashur-dan III, styled himself the governor of the lands of Suhu and Mari, so did his son Ninurta-Kudurri-Usur. However, by that time, Mari was known to be located in the so-called Land of Laqe, making <b>it</b> <b>unlikely</b> that the Usur family actually controlled it, and suggesting that the title was employed out of historical reasons. The city continued as a small settlement until the Hellenistic period before disappearing from records.|$|E
50|$|While coveting your neighbor's wife {{may involve}} sexual desire, <b>it's</b> <b>unlikely</b> that coveting a neighbor's house or field is sexual in nature. And in most New Testament uses, the word ἐπιθυμέω {{does not have}} a clear sexual connotation, e.g.|$|R
50|$|Although lowland {{rainforest}} in Papua New Guinea {{is increasingly}} being cleared for logging and conversion to agriculture, this species is widespread across {{the island and}} can persist in some modified habitats, so <b>it's</b> <b>unlikely</b> to be in any imminent danger.|$|R
50|$|Scientists {{have not}} {{uncovered}} {{any evidence of}} intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. Although absence of evidence is not necessarily evidence of absence, Mundane science fiction writers believe <b>it's</b> <b>unlikely</b> that alien intelligence will overcome the physical constraints on interstellar travel any better than we can. As such, Mundane science fiction writers imagine a future on Earth and within {{the solar system and}} believe <b>it's</b> highly <b>unlikely</b> that intelligent life survives elsewhere in this solar system.|$|R
