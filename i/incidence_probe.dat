40|$|Oblique {{incidence}} reflectometry is {{a simple}} and accurate method for measuring the absorption and the reduced-scattering coefficients of turbid media. We used this technique to deduce absorption and reduced-scattering spectra from wavelength-resolved measurements of the relative diffuse reflectance profile of white light {{as a function of}} source–detector distance. In this study, we measured the absorption and the reduced-scattering coefficients of chicken breast tissue in the visible range (400 – 800 nm) with the oblique <b>incidence</b> <b>probe</b> oriented at 0 ° and 90 ° relative to the muscle fibers. We found that the deduced optical properties varied with the probe orientation. Measurements on homogenized chicken breast tissue yielded an absorption spectrum comparable with the average of the absorption spectra for 0 ° and 90 ° probe orientations measured on the unhomogenized tissue. The reduced-scattering spectrum for homogeneous tissue was greater than that acquired for unhomogenized tissue taken at either probe orientation. This experiment demonstrated the application of oblique-incidence, fiber-optic reflectometry to measurements on biological tissues and the effect of tissue structural anisotropy on optical properties...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{study the}} polarisation-dependent polariton-polariton {{interaction}} through {{its effect on}} a para-metric scattering process in a microcavity (MC). The ratio of the anti-circular interaction strength V 2 against its co-circular counterpart V 1 is involved in defining the regime in which many nonlinear processes arise in MCs, such as parametric conversion or condensation. We measure the ratio V 2 /V 1 using a stimulated energy-degenerate parametric scattering process in a multiple MC. The sample is pumped at normal <b>incidence,</b> <b>probed</b> with a non-zero angle, and the phase-matched idler is observed at the opposite angle. The idler behaviour, both in power and polarisation, is compared to a hamiltonian interaction model {{that takes into account}} the two polarisation-dependent parametric scattering channels characterized by V 1 and V 2. The proposed method to measure the ratio V 2 /V 1 is convenient and precise. The flexibility of the triple MC allows to observe the process and measure this ratio over a large range of detunings, where we find it to be highly dependent on the detuning. These measurements complement the previous study of Vladimirova et al. 1 for detunings that were unexplored up to now...|$|R
50|$|The {{theory of}} optical {{detection}} in multilayer samples, including both interface motion and the photoelastic effect, is now well-developed.

40|$|In this work, SiO 2 and {{fluorine}} and phosphorous doped SiO 2 {{thin films}} are investigated using FTIR and Raman techniques. FTIR spectroscopy was performed at normal and oblique <b>incidence</b> of the <b>probe</b> beam in transmission and reflection modes. The effect of polarisation and angle of <b>incidence</b> of the <b>probe</b> beam is examined {{for the case}} of reflection mode. Infrared spectra taken from doped oxides show that the structure changes {{with the passage of}} time. Alternate methods to calculate the thickness of the doped film are also discussed. Infrared spectra of electron beam evaporated oxides give valuable information on their structure and water content. The porosity is calculated for these samples. Finally, micro-Raman spectroscopy is used to measure the fluorine content in a device structure...|$|R
40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} for directly measuring the time-averaged streamwise momentum in a turbulent stream use a probe which has total head response which varies as the cosine-squared of {{the angle of}} <b>incidence.</b> The <b>probe</b> has a nose with a slight indentation on its front face for providing the desired response. The method of making the probe incorporates unique design features. Another probe may be positioned in a side-by-side relationship to the first probe to provide a direct measurement of the total pressure. The {{difference between the two}} pressures yields the sum of the squares of the cross-stream components of the turbulence level...|$|R
40|$|Tests {{carried out}} on a short static probe at {{supersonic}} speeds between Mach numbers of 1. 1 and 2. 5 are described. The probe consists of a 500 included angle cone-cylinder having sensing holes 0. 98 calibres aft of the cone-cylinder junction. The tests show that at zero <b>incidence</b> the <b>probe</b> measures a pressure (approximately independent of Ilach number) of 0. 793 times the local static pressure. They also show that, at up to la 0 incidence in any pitch plane, the pressure measured is 0. 763 + 0. 33 times the local static pressure. For a limited Mach number range near a tiach number of 1. 6, this accuracy can be maintained to incidences over 30 ° [...] Of particular interest {{is the fact that}} relatively small internal differences between externally identical probes appear to {{have a significant effect on}} the incidence characteristics and in some respects can improve the performance...|$|R
40|$|Photo-induced {{behavior}} of Azo Disperse one (AZD 1) doped Poly(Methyl MethAcrylate) (PMMA) using both linear and circular polarized light is studied. The anisotropy is not erased by the circular polarization light. The circular polarization light combined with relatively long lifetime of the cis state in azo dye doped polymers activate all transverse directions of the angular hole burning through the {{spot in the}} film inducing anisotropy. Under circular polarized light, there is no orientation perpendicularly to the helex described by the rotating electric field vector, trans molecules reorients in the propagation direction of the pump beam. The polarization state of the probe beam after propagation through the pumped spot depends strongly on the angle of incidence of both pump and probe beams on the input face. In the case where circular polarized pump and probe beams are under the same angle of <b>incidence,</b> the <b>probe</b> beam “sees” anisotropic film {{as if it is}} isotropic. Results of this work shows the possibility to reorient azobenzene-type molecules in two orthogonal directions using alternately linearly and circularly polarized beams...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{enhancement}} of the ultrafast coherent generation and detection of acoustic phonons in an optical microcavity is experimentally studied. We report pump-probe terahertz ultrasonic experiments in an optical microcavity {{as a function}} of laser energy and <b>probe</b> <b>incidence</b> angle. By tuning the laser wavelength to resonate with the microcavity mode at normal incidence and simultaneously varying the incidence angle of the probe beam we achieve a double optical enhancement. Under this condition both the coherent generation and detection of acoustic nanowaves are strongly enhanced. We demonstrate the use of optical microcavities as a promising tool to study acoustic phonons in reduced dimensions with increased sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|Coupling between {{excitons}} of CdSe nanocrystal {{quantum dots}} (NQDs) and surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) of an Ag film {{attached to a}} prism have been studied by steady-state and transient reflectivity measurements in the Kretschmann geometry. In these experiments, the angle of <b>incidence</b> of the <b>probe</b> beam selects hybrid exciton/SPP states with different wavevectors and exciton/SPP compositions. The dynamics measured in the transient reflectivity experiments {{are sensitive to the}} composition of the hybrid states. Specifically, fast dynamics are observed at probe wavevectors where the lower hybrid state has predominant SPP character. In contrast, at probe wavevectors where the lower hybrid state is predominantly excitonic, the dynamics are similar to that measured for CdSe NQDs on glass...|$|R
3000|$|The {{formation}} of the periodic grating {{on the surface of}} the gold chip changed the shape of the reflection curve in comparison with the same measurements for the standard Au chip. Figure  2 b shows the SPR curves for the chip with nanostructured surface; the parameters of the surface relief correspond to Fig.  1 a (the grating with depth of relief of 13.5  nm). The sample was fixed in the SPR refractometer so that the plane of <b>incidence</b> of the <b>probing</b> laser beam was parallel to the grating wave vector (perpendicular to the grating grooves). It is seen that the resonance curves are broadened and two minimums are observed. This is consistent with the results of theoretical modeling [15] which showed that for a periodic relief, the SPR curve near Bragg resonance has a two-mode structure with two minima. The shift of the absolute minimum position, Δθ [...]...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to elicit {{guidance}} from prosecutors across Australia on questioning children about repeated events. Two focus groups were conducted; the first sought broad feedback concerning questioning children about repeated events. The second focused more specifically on eliciting feedback about techniques for aiding children in describing specific instances of repeated events. These techniques were derived either from empirical research, best practice interview guidelines, or both. Data from both focus groups were compiled because themes were highly similar. Thematic analysis of the focus group discussions revealed three broad themes in prosecutors’ perceptions about questioning children about repeated abuse: a) permitting children to provide a full generic account before describing individual episodes of abuse, b) using the information obtained during the generic account to create episode labels, and c) <b>probing</b> <b>incidences</b> of abuse chronologically. These themes are discussed within the context of the child development and mnemonic literature, and implications for interviewing protocols are drawn...|$|R
30|$|The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) {{method was}} {{introduced}} to numerically investigate the surface plasmon-related optical property and performance and to theoretically optimize its structure. A p-polarized plane wave with the wavelength of 632.8  nm {{was used as the}} excitation light. It was incident from the glass side on the base of the <b>probe</b> at normal <b>incidence.</b> The <b>probe</b> was composed of a sharp metallic tip and a gold-coated base with a couple of semi-circular slots corrugated on it. Two homocentric semi-circular slots with the same width of 0.10  μm were carved through the 0.12 -μm-thick gold film. The thickness of the gold film was much thicker than the skin depth. Hence, the direct incident light was screened out to avoid the immediate exposure of the specimen to the incident light, so that the far-field background can be significantly reduced consequentially. The metallic slots in circular shape performed as a plasmonic launcher to couple the incident light into the propagating SPP waves and a sink to guide the SPP waves to converge toward the center. The radius of the left semi-circular slot was fixed to 1.50  μm and the right one was numerically optimized with parameter sweep. The radius mismatch {{was introduced to}} composite the phase difference. A platinum tip with the height of 1.50  μm stood {{at the center of the}} semi-circular slots on the gold film. To account for the realistic processing capacity, the tip was composed of a set of platinic pies of decreasing size stacked one on top of another resembling a cone. The diameter at the bottom of the tip was 0.80 and 0.25  μm at the apex.|$|R
40|$|A pump-probe polarimetric {{technique}} is demonstrated, {{which provides a}} complete, temporally and spatially-resolved mapping of the megagauss magnetic fields generated in intense short-pulse laser-plasma interactions. A normally-incident time-delayed probe pulse reflected from its critical surface undergoes a change in its ellipticity according to the magneto-optic Cotton-Mouton effect due to the azimuthal nature of the ambient self-generated megagauss magnetic fields. The temporal resolution of the magnetic field mapping is {{of the order of}} the pulsewidth, whereas a spatial resolution of a few microns is achieved by this optical technique. In addition, this technique does not suffer from refraction effects due to the steep plasma density gradients owing to the near-normal <b>incidence</b> of the <b>probe</b> pulse and consequently, higher harmonics of the probe can be employed to penetrate deeper into the plasma to even near-solid densities. The spatial and temporal evolution of the megagauss magnetic fields at the target front {{as well as at the}} target rear are presented. The micron-scale resolution of the magnetic field mapping provides valuable information on the filamentary instabilities at the target front, whereas probing the target rear mirrors the highly complex fast electron transport in intense laser-plasma interactions.

40|$|Abridged] After many {{attempts}} {{over more}} than a decade, high-resolution spectroscopy has recently delivered its first detections of molecular absorption in exoplanet atmospheres, both in transmission and thermal emission spectra. Targeting the combined signal from individual lines in molecular bands, these measurements use variations in the planet radial velocity to disentangle the planet signal from telluric and stellar contaminants. In this paper we apply high resolution spectroscopy to probe molecular absorption in the day-side spectrum of the bright transiting hot Jupiter HD 189733 b. We observed HD 189733 b with the CRIRES high-resolution near-infrared spectograph on the Very Large Telescope during three nights. We detect a 5 -sigma absorption signal from CO at a contrast level of ~ 4. 5 e- 4 {{with respect to the}} stellar continuum, revealing the planet orbital radial velocity at 154 + 4 /- 3 km s- 1. This allows us to solve for the planet and stellar mass in a similar way as for stellar eclipsing binaries, resulting in Ms= 0. 846 + 0. 068 /- 0. 049 Msun and Mp= 1. 162 + 0. 058 /- 0. 039 MJup. No significant absorption is detected from H 2 O, CO 2 or CH 4 and we determined upper limits on their line contrasts here. The detection of CO in the day-side spectrum of HD 189733 b can be made consistent with the haze layer proposed to explain the optical to near-infrared transmission spectrum if the layer is optically thin at the normal <b>incidence</b> angles <b>probed</b> by our observations, or if the CO abundance is high enough for the CO absorption to originate from above the haze. Our non-detection of CO 2 at 2. 0 micron is not inconsistent with the deep CO 2 absorption from low resolution NICMOS secondary eclipse data in the same wavelength range. If genuine, the absorption would be so strong that it blanks out any planet light completely in this wavelength range, leaving no high-resolution signal to be measured.

40|$|Background and Objective The pulpal {{chamber of}} each tooth {{contains}} the vasculature {{necessary to maintain}} a viable tooth. A critical need exists to develop an objective, repeatable method to assess pulpal viability. We hypothesized {{that the existence of}} blood perfusion within the pulp can be determined with analysis of laser speckle imaging (LSI) patterns generated by transillumination of the tooth. Study Design/Materials and Methods We used nine extracted human cuspids and incisors. A Tygon tube was inserted into a channel created within each tooth and Intralipid pumped through the tube in a controlled manner with a syringe infusion pump. We evaluated the feasibility of LSI for flow assessment using both transillumination and epiillumination imaging configurations. With the transillumination geometry, we also assessed the effect of the angle of <b>incidence</b> of the <b>probe</b> laser light on the speckle flow index (SFI) values extracted from the collected speckle images. Results Transillumination LSI, and not epiillumination LSI, enables differentiation between the absence and presence of perfusion in an in vitro tooth model. SFI values are insensitive to the relative angle of incidence of the laser light, over a wide range of angles. Conclusions Our preliminary in vitro data suggest that transillumination LSI is a promising method to identify the presence of blood flow in the pulpal chamber.

40|$|Effective {{active control}} of {{rotating}} stall in axial compressors requires detailed understanding of flow instabilities {{associated with this}} compressor regime. Newly designed miniature high frequency response total and static pressure probes as well as commercial thermoanemometric probes are suitable tools for this task. However, during the rotating stall cycle the probes are subjected to flow direction changes that are far larger than the range of <b>probe</b> <b>incidence</b> acceptance, and therefore probe data without a proper correction would misrepresent unsteady variations of flow parameters. A methodology, based on ensemble averaging, is proposed to circumvent this problem. In this approach the ensemble averaged signals acquired for various probe setting angles are segmented, and only the sections for probe setting angles close to the actual flow angle are used for signal recombination. The methodology was verified by excellent agreement between velocity distributions obtained from pressure probe data, and data measured with thermoanemometric probes. Vector plots of unsteady flow behavior during the rotating stall regime indicate reversed flow within the rotating stall cell that spreads over to adjacent rotor blade channels. Results of this study confirmed that the NASA Low Speed Axial Compressor (LSAC) while in a rotating stall regime at rotor design speed exhibits one stall cell that rotates at a speed equal to 50. 6 percent of the rotor shaft speed...|$|R
40|$|Honey bees, Apis mellifera, use {{short-lived}} repellent Scent {{marks to}} distinguish and reject flowers that {{have recently been}} visited by themselves or by siblings, and so save time {{that would otherwise be}} spent in probing empty flowers. Conversely, both honey bees and bumblebees, Bombus spp., can mark rewarding flowers with scent marks that promote probing by conspecifics. We examined detection of recently visited flowers in a mixed community of bumblebees foraging on comfrey, Symphytum officinale, in southern England. When foraging among inflorescences on a plant, three abundant species of Bombus probed fewer inflorescences more than once than would be expected from random foraging. Bees frequently encountered inflorescences but departed without probing them for nectar. Examination of the incidence of such rejections in the two most common species, B. terrestris and B. pascuorum, revealed that the low <b>incidence</b> of multiple <b>probing</b> visits was due to two factors: bees both foraged systematically and selectively rejected inflorescences that they had previously visited. When presented with inflorescences of known history, bees selectively rejected those that had been recently visited by themselves or by conspecifics compared with randomly selected inflorescences. They were also able to distinguish inflorescences that had been visited by other Bombus species. Bees were unable to distinguish and reject inflorescences from which the nectar had been removed artificially. We conclude that these Bombus species are probably using scent marks left by previous visitors. The significance of deposition and detection of interspecific scent marks for competitive interactions between species is discussed...|$|R
40|$|During {{the testing}} of {{development}} engines and components, intrusive instrumentation such as Kiel head Pitot probes and shrouded thermocouples are used to evaluate gas properties and performance. The size of these instruments can be significant relative to the blades {{and their impact on}} aerodynamic efficiency must be considered when analysing the test data. This paper reports on such parasitic losses for instruments mounted on the leading edge of a stator in a low pressure turbine, with particular emphasis on understanding the impact of probe geometry on the induced loss. The instrumentation and turbine blades were modeled in a low Mach number cascade facility with an upstream turbulence grid. The cascade was designed so that leading edge probes were interchangeable in-situ, allowing for rapid testing of differing probe geometries. RANS calculations were performed to complement the experiments and improve understanding of the flow behaviour. A horseshoe vortex-like system forms where the probe body joins the blade leading edge, generating pairs of streamwise vortices which convect over the blade pressure and suction surfaces. These vortices promote mixing between freestream and boundary layer fluid, and promote the transition of the boundary layer from laminar to turbulent flow. Tests with realistic probe geometries demonstrated that the design of the shroud bleed system can impact losses and a study using idealised cylinders was performed to isolate the impact of probe diameter, aspect ratio and <b>incidence.</b> Beyond a <b>probe</b> aspect ratio of two; parasitic loss was found to scale approximately with probe frontal area.
