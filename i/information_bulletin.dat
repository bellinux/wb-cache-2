50|$|The {{commission}} gathered as {{much information}} as possible of victims of psychiatric terror in the Soviet Union and published this information in their <b>Information</b> <b>Bulletins.</b> For the four years of its existence, the Commission published more than 1,500 pages of documentation including 22 <b>Information</b> <b>Bulletins</b> in which over 400 cases of the political abuse of psychiatry were documented in great detail. Summaries of the <b>Information</b> <b>Bulletins</b> were published in the key samizdat publication, A Chronicle of Current Events. The <b>Information</b> <b>Bulletins</b> were sent to the Soviet officials, with request to verify the data and notify the Commission if mistakes were found, and to the West, where human rights defenders used them {{in the course of their}} campaigns. The <b>Information</b> <b>Bulletins</b> were also used to provide the dissident movement with information about Western protests against the political abuse. The Working Commission also gathered information about relevant international events and published reports on the Honolulu Congress of the World Psychiatric Association, including the texts of the key resolutions, and printed translations of long letters by Professor Peter Berner about the course of establishing the Review Committee on abuse.|$|R

5|$|On 1 November 1941, Lent became acting Group Commander Gruppenkommandeur of {{the newly}} formed II./NJG2. Lent's first aerial victory as a Gruppenkommandeur, his 20th night-time, and his last in 1941, came during the night of Friday 7 November to Saturday 8 November. He shot down a Wellington 1C heading for Berlin, which came down near Akkrum. The six-man crew of the bomber, X9976 of No. 75 (New Zealand) Squadron, was killed in action. This {{achievement}} earned Lent a reference in the Wehrmachtbericht (his first of six in total), an <b>information</b> <b>bulletin</b> issued by {{the headquarters of the}} Wehrmacht.

5|$|With {{a narrow}} ridge of high {{pressure}} to its north, the depression moved west-southwestward. Atmospheric conditions were unusually favorable {{for the time}} of the year due to the ridge of high pressure preventing cold air from reaching the central Atlantic Ocean. This allowed the depression to intensify into a tropical storm later on December 30, based on direct observations. There were few direct observations for the following days, but it is estimated the storm intensified into a hurricane on December 31 while located about 475miles (770km) east-northeast of Barbuda. On January 1, 1955, a ship within 10miles (16km) of the center reported hurricane-force winds and a pressure of 987mbar. Based on this report and several other ship reports, the system was recognized as a tropical low by the San Juan Weather Bureau Office. The hurricane continued to the southwest, and entered the Caribbean Sea on January 2 after passing between Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy. A portion of the eyewall moved over Saint Martin and Saba. Based on near-hurricane-force winds from the affected islands, an <b>information</b> <b>bulletin</b> named the system as Hurricane Alice while in the northeastern Caribbean Sea. Throughout its track, Alice was a small tropical cyclone with a diameter of only around 60miles (95km).|$|E

25|$|This {{growth in}} the unofficial, {{alternative}} and uncensored circulation of information led a group including poet and translator Natalya Gorbanevskaya, writer Ilya Gabay and physicist Pavel Litvinov to consider organising a regular <b>information</b> <b>bulletin.</b> Rather than follow previous samizdat genres, the literary almanac (e.g. Phoenix, Syntaxis) or collections documenting a single trial (e.g. The White Book), the new periodical would process the steady flow of information by circulating regular reports and updates about searches, arrests, trials, conditions in prisons and camps and extrajudicial measures against protest and dissent — {{at least for the}} duration of 1968. That year marked the 20th anniversary of the UN Declaration of Human Rights and Nos 1–5 are titled Human Rights Year in the Soviet Union: until 1969 A Chronicle of Current Events was the sub-title of the periodical.|$|E
25|$|At first, the {{confederation}} {{council and}} the national committee continued their work in secret, publishing a regular <b>Information</b> <b>Bulletin,</b> but on 2 November 1927, an assault by the government, which included arrests and attacks on suspected union offices by the police, further restricted union activity. The CGT continued to exist nonetheless. In 1929, it was even able to regain legality in a judicial battle, which it retained until 23 September 1933, when two government decrees banned all non-state-controlled trade unions. A general strike by the CGT and other organizations called for on 18 January 1934 failed. The illegal activities by the CGT were then limited to Lisbon and the Algarve. In 1938, Emídio Santana, the secretary-general of the federation, {{took part in a}} failed assassination attempt on Salazar. The ensuing repression killed off the CGT completely.|$|E
25|$|In January 2012 the Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority {{issued an}} {{airworthiness}} directive grounding all Bonanzas, Twin Bonanzas and Debonairs {{equipped with a}} single pole-style yoke, having forward elevator control cables more than 15 years old, until they could be inspected. The AD was issued based on two aircraft found to have frayed cables, one of which suffered a cable failure just prior to takeoff and resulting concerns {{about the age of}} the cables in fleet aircraft of this age. At the time of the grounding some Bonanzas had reached 64 years in service. Aircraft with frayed cables were grounded until the cables were replaced and those that passed inspection were required to have their cables replaced within 60 days regardless. The AD affected only Australian aircraft and was not adopted by the airworthiness authority responsible for the type certificate, the US Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA instead opted to issue a Special Airworthiness <b>Information</b> <b>Bulletin</b> (SAIB) requesting that the elevator control cables be inspected during the annual inspection.|$|E

The <b>Information</b> <b>Bulletins</b> were also used to provide the dissident movement with information about Western protests against the political abuse. Peter Reddaway said that after he had studied official documents in the Soviet archives, including minutes from meetings of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, it became evident to him that Soviet officials at high levels paid close attention to foreign responses to these cases, and if someone was discharged, all dissidents felt the pressure had played a significant part and the more foreign pressure the better. Over fifty victims examined by psychiatrists of the Moscow Working Commission between 1977 and 1981 and the files smuggled to the West by Vladimir Bukovsky in 1971 were the material that convinced most psychiatric associations that there was distinctly something wrong in the USSR.The Soviet authorities responded aggressively. Members of the group were being threatened, followed, subjected to house searches and interrogations. In the end, the members of the Commission were subjected to various terms and types of punishments: Alexander Podrabinek was sentenced to 5 years' internal exile, Irina Grivnina to 5 years' internal exile, Vyacheslav Bakhmin to 3 years in a labor camp, Leonard Ternovsky to 3 years' labor camp, Anatoly Koryagin to 8 years' imprisonment and labor camp and 4 years' internal exile, Alexander Voloshanovich was sent to voluntary exile.|$|R

25|$|Following the Allied Invasion of Normandy {{the already}} largely {{depleted}} bomber forces {{had to fly}} support missions of the Heer on the Invasion Front. On 26 June 1944 Pletz was honorably mentioned in the Wehrmachtbericht, an <b>information</b> <b>bulletin</b> issued by {{the headquarters of the}} Wehrmacht. On 10 October 1944, the bomber crews of IX Fliegerkorps were remustered as infantry or as fighter pilots. Peltz, who by training and experience was a bomber expert but admired by Hitler for efficiency in carrying out orders, became the commander of the II. Jagdkorps (2nd Fighter Corps) which saw action during the Ardennes offensive, in particular the Operation Bodenplatte, the attempt to gain air superiority during the stagnant stage of the Battle of the Bulge so that the German Army and Waffen-SS forces could resume their advance. The operation achieved some surprise and tactical success, but was ultimately a failure. A great many Allied aircraft were destroyed on the ground but replaced within a week. Allied aircrew casualties were quite small, since the majority of Allied losses were empty planes sitting on the ground. The Germans, however, lost many of their fighter pilots that they could not readily replace.|$|E
