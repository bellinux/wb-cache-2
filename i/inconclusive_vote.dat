50|$|Donald Payne, Jr. {{resigned}} as council member on November 15, 2012 {{when he was}} sworn-in as a U.S. Representative. James held the position that as the 5th largest vote-getter in the previous election in which the incumbents were returned he should be appointed to the office. With the eight council members split (4 yeas, 2 nays, and 2 abstain) over {{the choice of a}} successor, Mayor of Newark Cory A. Booker cast the deciding vote and on November 20, 2012, Shanique Davis Speight was sworn into office to fill the vacant seat. At the council meeting residents opposed to Booker's vote took vocal issue with his decision. The matter was brought to court and in December 2012, Judge Dennis Carey III ruled that Booker was not entitled to cast a vote to fill the council vacancy since no tie existed and that Speight could not fill the seat, reinstating the <b>inconclusive</b> <b>vote</b> on the council that would remain until Payne's seat was filled {{based on the results of}} a special election to be held in November 2013.|$|E

50|$|After eight {{rounds of}} <b>inconclusive</b> <b>voting,</b> General Assembly President Nassir Abdulaziz al-Nasser {{initially}} decided to re-schedule {{the next round}} of voting for 24 October following the election of members to the Economic and Social Council. However, Azerbaijan requested the ballot be continued for one more hour; the request was agreed to after Russian support despite opposition from France {{on the basis of a}} lack of translation services.|$|R
50|$|Following five {{rounds of}} <b>inconclusive</b> <b>voting,</b> Bert Koenders and Paolo Gentiloni, Foreign Ministers of the Netherlands and Italy respectively, {{announced}} a proposal whereby the Netherlands and Italy would split the two-year term with each country serving one year. Such arrangements were relatively common in deadlocked elections {{starting in the}} late 1950s until 1966, when the Security Council was enlarged. This however {{would be the first}} time in over five decades that two members agreed to split a term; intractable deadlocks have instead usually been resolved by the candidate countries withdrawing in favor of a third member state.|$|R
5000|$|Blair's {{first term}} saw an {{extensive}} programme of {{changes to the}} constitution. The Human Rights Act was introduced in 1998; a Scottish Parliament and a Welsh Assembly were set up; most hereditary peers {{were removed from the}} House of Lords in 1999; the Greater London Authority and the post of Mayor of London were established in 2000; and the Freedom of Information Act was passed later in the same year, with its provisions coming into effect over the following decade. This last Act disappointed campaigners , whose hopes had been raised by a 1998 White Paper which had promised more robust legislation. Blair later described the FoIA as one of his [...] "biggest regrets", writing in his autobiography, [...] "I shudder at the imbecility of it." [...] Whether the House of Lords should be fully appointed, fully elected, or be subject to {{a combination of the two}} remained a disputed question. 2003 saw a series of <b>inconclusive</b> <b>votes</b> on the matter in the House of Commons.|$|R

At the meeting, Zhao {{announced that he was}} ready to [...] "take leave", citing he could not bring himself to carry out martial law. The elders in attendance at the meeting, Bo Yibo and Yang Shangkun, urged the PSC to follow Deng's orders. Zhao did not consider the <b>inconclusive</b> PSC <b>vote</b> to have legally binding implications on martial law; Yang Shangkun, in his capacity as Vice-Chairman of the Central Military Commission, went on to mobilize the military to move into the capital.|$|R
50|$|Initial {{results of}} the October 28, 2007, {{election}} indicated that Alak finished behind opposition candidate Pablo Bruera who took 25% to Alak's 20%. Sensing defeat, Alak's campaign operators attempted to suggest a link between Bruera and the killing of three policemen in La Plata, which took place nine days before the election; all investigations were <b>inconclusive</b> as of <b>voting</b> day, however (three suspects were detained and subsequently released).|$|R
5000|$|After 7 {{additional}} <b>inconclusive</b> {{rounds of}} <b>voting</b> on 24 October, Slovenia's delegation told the General Assembly {{that while it}} believed Slovenia {{would be a good}} addition for the Security Council, it did not approve {{of the way in which}} the election was being held and was withdrawing its candidacy as the [...] "will of the Assembly was clear". In the 17th round that followed, Azerbaijan achieved the necessary 2/3 majority and won the Eastern European seat.|$|R
5000|$|Following {{the second}} day of <b>inconclusive</b> balloting, the <b>vote</b> was {{postponed}} until the following Thursday, 19 October 2006. Given the high number of abstentions in the later rounds of Tuesday's voting, the BBC inferred that delegations may have been trying to send a signal {{that it is time to}} seek an alternative candidate; it mentioned the names of Costa Rica, Panama and Uruguay.A private informal meeting of the Latin American and Caribbean Group was held on 18 October, but it failed to break the deadlock. After the meeting, Mexican ambassador Enrique Berruga publicly called on Venezuela to withdraw on grounds of [...] "diplomatic courtesy".|$|R
5000|$|The seventh {{round of}} voting {{was held on}} 21 October 1975 during the 2386th meeting. After this <b>inconclusive</b> round of <b>voting,</b> Mr. Baroody of Saudi Arabia rose to speak and appealed to both India and Pakistan not {{to agree on a}} one-year period each, as such {{precedents}} in similar situations were made known to him. Next to speak was Mr. Bishara of Kuwait; citing rule 76 of the rules of procedure, he motioned for an immediate adjournment of the meeting for 48 hours. He did this because he found that [...] "this, to put it mildly, unpleasant and indeed unattractive spectacle does not redound to the prestige of this Assembly or do it honour.". The motion was put to a vote and was adopted by 124 votes for and one against, with 5 abstentions, and the meeting rose.|$|R

Zhao did not consider the <b>inconclusive</b> PSC <b>vote</b> to have legally binding implications on martial law; Yang Shangkun, in his capacity as Vice-Chairman of the Central Military Commission, went on to mobilize the military to move into the capital. Students, we came too late. We are sorry. You talk about us, criticize us, it is all necessary. The reason that I came here is not to ask you to forgive us. All I want to say is that students are getting very weak, it is the 7th day since you went on hunger strike, you can't continue like this. ...You are still young, there are still many days yet to come, you must live healthy, and see the day when China accomplishes the four modernizations. You are not like us, we are already old, it doesn't matter to us any more. - Zhao Ziyang at Tiananmen Square. 19 May 1989. Li Peng met with students {{for the first time on}} 18 May in an attempt to placate public concern over the hunger strike. During the talks, student leaders once again demanded that the government rescind the April 26 editorial and affirm the student movement as [...] "patriotic". Li Peng said the government's main concern was sending hunger strikers to hospital. The discussions yielded little substantive results, but gained student leaders prominent airtime on national television.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the first}} round of voting, Bolivia, Czechoslovakia, Gabon, and Kuwait were elected, leaving one more seat to be filled in Africa. According to rule 94 of the rules of procedure, the next three rounds of voting would be {{restricted}} to the two countries that acquired the highest number of votes in this first round, namely Niger and Nigeria. Any ballots containing the names of other countries would be considered invalid. The second round of <b>voting</b> was <b>inconclusive,</b> so a third was ordered by the President. While the vote had begun, the President called on the representative of Niger. Mr. Djermakoye of Niger made a statement that was considered ambiguous by at least one member of the Assembly: [...] "I should like to remind the entire Assembly that Niger's candidacy is that of an African country. We note that {{at this stage of the}} elections certain principles governing the various groups of States in the Assembly as a whole have not been respected. We note also that the African candidacy seems less and less to be borne in mind by the entire Assembly. Consequently, Niger does not insist that the election continues. We should like to add, however, that it is not Niger that has been beaten but the Organisation of African Unity." [...] After this statement, the President declared that the representative of Niger has withdrawn his candidacy. Next to speak was Mr. Richard of the United Kingdom; he suggested that the current vote be discontinued and a new round started. Then Mr. Fall of Senegal rose to speak, asking whether a vote can be legally interrupted, as two countries have already voted. The President answered affirmatively to this question and the third round was finalised. During the vote Mr. Garba of Nigeria also rose to speak, asking for clarification on the statement of Mr. Djermakoye: [...] "Was he withdrawing his country's candidature or was he disassociatinghimself from the results of this present ballot?". Finally, Mr. Baroody of Saudi Arabia spoke, reminding that at such situations, on more than one occasion, one of the two contesting countries would withdraw, and there would be an understanding that this country would be elected at a later election. He also pleaded for the election not to drag on, as [...] "That would not redound to our dignity or to our honour." [...] Then the results of the fourth, again <b>inconclusive</b> round of <b>voting</b> were made known. Then the fifth and final round of voting was held, and Nigeria was elected. This fifth round was unrestricted - any nation could be voted for.|$|R
