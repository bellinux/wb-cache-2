50|$|For low-stressed {{structure}} in light aircraft, alloys 3003-H12, H14, and H16; 5052-O, H32, H34, and H36; and 6061-T4 and T6 are sometimes employed. These alloys are also primary selections for fuel, lubricating oil, and hydraulic oil tanks, piping, and <b>instrument</b> <b>tubing</b> and brackets, especially where welding is required. Alloys 3003, 6061, and 6951 are utilized extensively in brazed heat exchangers and hydraulic accessories. Recently developed alloys, such as 5086, 5454, 5456, 6070, {{and the new}} weldable aluminum-magnesium-zinc alloys, offer strength advantages over those previously mentioned.|$|E
40|$|Frequency jumps are {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} in voice production. They are perceived as dis-continuities in voice pitch caused by smooth changes of physiological parameters, and may be observed in transitions between chest and falsetto vocal registers. Here, a recent model of birdsong production is used to model an oscillator source for the vocal folds coupled to an acoustic waveguide for the vocal tract, {{in terms of a}} delay differential equation. Numerical integration of the equation shows regions of coexistence of periodic solutions when the source-tract coupling is strong enough and the fundamental frequency is close to a resonance of the vocal tract. The coupling increases at larger subglottal pressures and smaller cross-sectional area of the vocal tract. The results reproduce patterns of chest-falsetto transitions, as well as voice instabilities observed when singing into a tube with increasing pitch. Further, they match data obtained from a mechanical replica of the vocal folds attached to a wave-guide of varying length. In general, these findings depart from the standard source-filter model of voice production, which regards the vocal tract as a mere filter to the glottal sound. The separation between the vocal source and tract holds as a valid approximation at low fre-quencies. However, source-tract interactions become relevant at higher frequencies, such as in cases of the singing voice and some animal vocalizations. The model may also find appli-cations in the sound production in brass musical instruments, to describe interactions between the oscillating lips and the <b>instrumentâ€™s</b> <b>tubing.</b> 1...|$|R
5000|$|The French horn (since the 1930s known {{simply as}} the [...] "horn" [...] in some {{professional}} music circles) is a brass <b>instrument</b> made of <b>tubing</b> wrapped into a coil with a flared bell. The double horn in F/B (technically a variety of German horn) is the horn most often used by players in professional orchestras and bands. A musician who plays any kind of horn is generally {{referred to as a}} horn player (or less frequently, a hornist).|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{distinct}} types of trumpet, {{with the most}} common being pitched in B (a transposing <b>instrument),</b> having a <b>tubing</b> length of about 1.48 m. Early trumpets did not provide means to change the length of <b>tubing,</b> whereas modern <b>instruments</b> generally have three (or sometimes four) valves in order to change their pitch. Most trumpets have valves of the piston type, while some have the rotary type. The use of rotary-valved trumpets {{is more common in}} orchestral settings, although this practice varies by country. Each valve, when engaged, increases the length of tubing, lowering the pitch of the instrument. A musician who plays the trumpet is called a trumpet player or trumpeter.|$|R
5000|$|The German horn is a brass <b>instrument</b> made of <b>tubing</b> wrapped into a coil with a flared bell, and in {{bands and}} orchestras {{is the most}} widely used of three types of horn, the other two being the French horn (in the less common, {{narrower}} meaning of the term) and the Vienna horn. Its use among professional players has become so universal that it is only in France and Vienna that any other kind of horn is used today. A musician who plays the German horn is called a horn player (or less frequently, a hornist). The word [...] "German" [...] is used only to distinguish this instrument from the now-rare French and Viennese instruments. Although the expression [...] "French horn" [...] is still used colloquially in English for any orchestral horn (German, French, or Viennese), since the 1930s professional musicians and scholars have generally avoided this term in favour of just [...] "horn". Vienna horns today are played only in Vienna, and are made only by Austrian firms. German horns, by contrast, are not all made by German manufacturers (e.g., Paxman in London; Conn in the US), nor are all French-style instruments made in France (e.g., Reynolds, during the 1940s and 50s in the US).|$|R
