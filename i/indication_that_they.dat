5|$|James Campbell refutes {{suggestions}} that the hides given for each tribe were {{the sum of}} a system of locally-collected assessments and argues that a two-tier system of assessment, one for large areas such as kingdoms and a more accurate one for individual estates, may have existed. He considers the possibility that many of the tribes named in the Tribal Hidage were no more than administrative units and that some names did not originate from a tribe itself but from a place from where the people were governed, eventually coming to signify the district where the tribe itself lived. Barbara Yorke suggests that the -sætan/sæte form of several of the place-names are an <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were named after a feature of the local landscape. She also suggests the tribes were dependent administrative units and not independent kingdoms, some of which were created as such after the main kingdoms were stabilized.|$|E
5|$|British {{reinforcement}} entered Basque Roads at 15:20, just as {{the crew}} of Calcutta abandoned the ship, withdrawing across the shoal. Forming a line of battle, the British opened a heavy fire on the nearby, and still grounded, Ville de Varsouvie while Beagle, armed with heavy carronades, nosed close inshore and took up station across the bow of Aquilon and raked the French ship repeatedly. For two hours these immobile French ships were battered by the British line with little reply, until at 17:30 both raised Union flags as an <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had surrendered. Shortly afterwards {{the crew of the}} wrecked Tonnere abandoned their ship and set it on fire. The French ship was destroyed by a magazine explosion at 19:30, followed at 20:30 by Calcutta, which had been mistakenly set on fire by an over-enthusiastic British boarding party. The storeship was carrying a large quantity of munitions, reportedly worth over half a million pounds in value, and produced an enormous explosion. Most of the British ships had suffered only minor damage and casualties from fire from the gun batteries on Île-d'Aix, where Revenge had temporarily grounded during the night and suffered 18 casualties. The French losses were minor except on Ville de Varsouvie, which had taken about 100 casualties in the exchange.|$|E

25|$|Skeletons {{have also}} been {{discovered}} with gastroliths, stones, in their stomachs, though whether to help break down food, especially cephalopods, in a muscular gizzard, or to vary buoyancy, or both, has not been established. However, the total weight of the gastroliths found in various specimens appear to be insufficient to modify the buoyancy of these large reptiles. The first plesiosaur gastroliths, found with Mauisaurus gardneri, were reported by Harry Govier Seeley in 1877. The number of these stones per individual is often very large. In 1949, a fossil of Alzadasaurus (specimen SDSM 451, later renamed to Styxosaurus) showed 253 of them. Also, the size of individual stones is often considerable. In 1991 an elasmosaurid specimen was investigated, KUVP 129744, containing a gastrolith with a diameter of seventeen centimetres and a weight of 1.3 kilogramme; and a somewhat shorter stone of 1490 gram. In total forty-seven gastroliths were present with a combined weight of thirteen kilogramme. The size of the stones {{has been seen as}} an <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were not swallowed by accident but deliberately, the animal perhaps covering large distances in search of a suitable rock type.|$|E
500|$|The first {{occupants}} of the Mesa Verde region, which spans from southeastern Utah to northwestern New Mexico, were nomadic Paleo-Indians who arrived in the area [...] BCE. They followed herds of big game and camped near rivers and streams, many of which dried up as the glaciers that once covered parts of the San Juan Mountains receded. The earliest Paleo-Indians were the Clovis culture and Folsom tradition, defined largely by {{the way in which}} they fashioned projectile points.

[...] Butler reported that [...] "notwithstanding my utmost Precaution and Endeavours to save the Women and Children, I could not prevent some of them falling unhappy Victims to the Fury of the Savages," [...] but also that {{he spent most of}} his time guarding the fort during the raid. [...] Quebec's Governor Frederick Haldimand was so upset at Butler's inability to control his forces that he refused to see him, writing [...] "such indiscriminate vengeance taken even upon the treacherous and cruel enemy they are engaged against is useless and disreputable to themselves, as it is contrary to the dispositions and maxims of the King whose cause they are fighting."

500|$|However, the Cylinder's {{account of}} Cyrus's conquest clearly {{does not tell}} the whole story, as it {{suppresses}} {{any mention of the}} earlier conflict between the Persians and the Babylonians; Max Mallowan describes it as a [...] "skilled work of tendentious history". The text omits the Battle of Opis, in which Cyrus's forces defeated and apparently massacred Nabonidus's army. Nor does it explain a two-week gap reported by the Nabonidus Chronicle between the Persian entry into Babylon and the surrender of the Esagila temple. Lisbeth S. Fried suggests {{that there may have been}} a siege or stand-off between the Persians and the temple's defenders and priests, about whose fate the Cylinder and Chronicle makes no mention. She speculates that they were killed or expelled by the Persians and replaced by more pro-Persian members of the Babylonian priestly elite. As Walton and Hill put it, the claim of a wholly peaceful takeover acclaimed by the people is [...] "standard conqueror's rhetoric and may obscure other facts." [...] Describing the claim of one's own armies being welcomed as liberators as [...] "one of the great imperial fantasies", Bruce Lincoln, Professor of Divinity at the University of Chicago, notes that the Babylonian population repeatedly revolted against Persian rule in 522 BC, 521 BC, 484 BC and 482 BC (though not against Cyrus or his son Cambeses). The rebels sought to restore national independence and the line of native Babylonian kings – perhaps an <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were not as favourably disposed towards the Persians as the Cylinder suggests.|$|E
