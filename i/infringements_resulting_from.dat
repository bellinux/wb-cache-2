Modern democratic societies disagree on the text, content, theory, and practice of this liberty. They disagree on whether it is a privileged right or a subordinate value. They disagree on what constitutes speech and what speech is worthy of protection. They disagree on theoretical foundations, uncertain if the right is grounded in libertarian impulses, the promotion of a marketplace of ideas, or the advancement of participatory democracy. They disagree on whether the right should be safeguarded by judicial review or subject to majoritarian legislative values. They disagree on whether the right may be invoked against <b>infringements</b> <b>resulting</b> <b>from</b> private as well as state action. In short, the freedom of expression is a universal value that is fraught with cultural contingencies. It is universal in abstraction and particularized in application...|$|E

For both groups, assisting with ADLs was directly related with objective burden, whereas PBs were directly related to all dimensions of burden. For both groups, stress burden was the only predictor of self-rated health, whereas PBs were significantly linked with intention to institutionalize. However, stress burden among spouses and relationship burden among adult children were significantly linked with intention to institutionalize.  Implications: We discuss the research and practice implications of the differing needs of spouses and adult children...|$|R

40|$|The essay {{deals with}} the {{important}} subject-matter of the State’s liability for violations of EU law attributable to the last instance judges of a Member State. Apart {{from the fact that}} according to the Court of Justice, the national competent court should take into account “the specific nature of the judicial function”, in reality that statement sounds more like a sort of lip service, being rather clear that “State liability for loss or damage caused by a decision of a national court adjudicating at last instance which infringes a rule of EU law is governed by the same conditions”(Köbler C- 224 / 01). 	The confirmation of such a thesis (no special regime for the responsibility of judges in line with Francovich doctrine) in a certain way comes out {{as a result of a}} subsequent case in which the ECJ, in evaluating the compatibility of Italian Law n. 117 / 88 (“Risarcimento dei danni cagionati nell'esercizio delle funzioni giudiziarie e responsabilità civile dei magistrati”), makes it clear that “Community law precludes national legislation which excludes State liability, in a general manner, for damage caused to individuals by an infringement of Community law attributable to a court adjudicating at last instance by reason of the fact that the <b>infringement</b> in question <b>results</b> <b>from</b> an interpretation of provisions of law or an assessment of facts or evidence carried out by that court” (Traghetti del Mediterraneo) ...|$|R

New technologies make detection easier and there are continual demands for new infringements to come under the expiation system, thus widening the area of criminality.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this paper is to review foreign IPR {{infringement}} issues affecting selected U. S. industries, with a particular emphasis on patent, trademark, and copyright infringement. Although the review is primarily based on qualitative information, some attempts to measure the effects of IPR infringement quantitatively also are reviewed. To provide background and context for the analysis, the authors discuss the problem of foreign IPR infringement for U. S. industry; describe certain U. S. trade laws and international agreements that attempt to address such infringement; review examples of inadequate foreign patent, trademark, and copyright protection and their implications for selected U. S. industries; and describe U. S. private and public sector efforts to address such problems. The paper finds that (1) intellectual property protection is essential to encouraging creative expression and the development of new products in a number of industries; (2) the development of intellectual property-based products is generally far more expensive than their manufacture or duplication; (3) inadequate IPR protection leaves firms vulnerable to infringement, causing them to risk their investment and reputations; (4) foreign IPR <b>infringement</b> <b>results</b> in billions of dollars in lost revenues for U.
