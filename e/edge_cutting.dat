40|$|In microdrilling, {{because of}} lower feed, the microdrill <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> radius is {{comparable}} to the chip thickness. The <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> therefore should be regarded as rounded edges, which results in a more complex cutting mechanism. Because of this, the macrodrilling thrust modeling is not suitable for microdrilling. In this paper, a mathematical modeling to predict microdrilling thrust is developed, and the geometric characteristics of microdrill were considered in force models. The thrust is modeled in three parts: major <b>cutting</b> <b>edges,</b> secondary <b>cutting</b> <b>edge,</b> and indentation zone. Based on slip-line field theory, the major <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> and secondary <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> are divided into elements, and the elemental forces are determined by an oblique cutting model and an orthogonal model, respectively. The thrust modeling of the major <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> and second <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> includes two different kinds of processes: shearing and ploughing. The indentation zone is modeled as a rigid wedge. The force model is verified by comparing the predicted forces and the measured cutting forces...|$|R
