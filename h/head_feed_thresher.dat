40|$|Problem Statement: Regarding to {{considerable}} {{production of}} rice &# 13; crop in Iran, study and investigation about optimization of {{different stages of}} &# 13; this product processing seems necessary. The threshing of rice is a process which &# 13; must be accomplished desirability. Approach: In this study, the &# 13; effective factors effects on threshing loss, damaged grain percent and Material &# 13; Other than Grain (MOG) to grain ratio, were investigated on a <b>head</b> <b>feed</b> <b>threshing</b> &# 13; unit. Independent variables were included speed drum in five levels, variety in &# 13; two levels and moisture content of crop in two levels. Experiments were arranged &# 13; as a split-split plot fitted into randomized complete block with four replications. &# 13; Results: Results showed moisture content of crop, variety and &# 13; speed drum factors had significant effects on threshing loss, damaged grains percent &# 13; and MOG to grain ratio. The means of threshing loss and damaged grains percent &# 13; were excessive when the tests were doing with dry crop. The most of means of threshing &# 13; loss and damaged grains percent were allocated to Hashemi and Khazar varieties, &# 13; respectively. The most of MOG to grain ratio means obtained when the tests were &# 13; accomplished with Hashemy variety at wet condition of crop. Conclusions/Recommendations: &# 13; The optimum of drum speed was obtained 650 rpm. It is better that threshing &# 13; of paddy has been conducted in wet condition. Increasing of drum speed increased &# 13; the MOG to grain ratio significantly...|$|R

This unit {{was used to}} study the phenomenon of corn cob break-up {{and its effect on}} the performance of the threshing unit. It was found that the degree of corn cob break-up was affected by cylinder peripheral speed, cylinder-concave clearance and hybrid cultivar. Within the hybrid cultivars used, increased cob break-up was associated with decreased shelling efficiency and concave separation efficiency. The possibility of reducing kernel damage and increasing concave separation efficiency by changing some of the concave design parameters was investigated. A mathematical model of the tangential <b>feed</b> <b>threshing</b> unit was developed and used to investigate the effect of the concave design parameters. Experimental data indicated that kernel damage may be reduced by at least 24 per cent and concave separation efficiency increased by at least 38 per cent...|$|R

40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 5 th Annual Symposium on Graduate Research and Scholarly Projects (GRASP) held at the Hughes Metropolitan Complex, Wichita State University, May 1, 2009. Research completed at the Department Biological SciencesIn the study of biological control of weeds, effects of insect herbivores that attack different plant organs have long been assumed to be independent events. Emerging research indicates stronger interactions between herbivore guilds than was expected historically. My research focuses on damage to apical meristems of tall thistles (Cirsium altissimum) by stem mining insects and the indirect, plant-mediated effects of this damage on flower <b>head</b> <b>feeding</b> insects. Two questions were addressed: 1) how does mining of the apical meristem affect tall thistle architecture, including number of branches and flower heads produced? 2) what influence does apical meristem mining have on the intensity of damage to the plant by flower <b>head</b> <b>feeding</b> herbivores? Forty adult tall thistles at two different sites (80 plants total) were assigned to levels of a "meristem-herbivore exclusion treatment" in April, 2008. Insecticide {{was applied to the}} apical meristem of treatment plants. Control plants were sprayed with water or were not sprayed. Apical meristem mining had significant affects on; flower heads (F 2, 2 = 45. 97, p= 0. 021),primary stems (F= 11,p < 0. 001) and plant height over-all (F 2, 4 = 26. 39, p= 0. 004). There was a marginally significant effect on flower head damage, further work will be needed to understand the biological significance of this finding...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Dept. of Biological Sciences. A long standing, {{dominant}} {{paradigm in}} the biological control of weeds is the independence of insect herbivore guilds' effects on their host plant. Recent work has shown stronger interactions among insect herbivore guilds than was previously expected. My research focuses on damage to apical meristems of tall thistles (Cirsium altissimum) by stem mining insects and the direct effects of this damage on plant architecture {{as well as the}} indirect, plant-mediated effects of this damage on flower <b>head</b> <b>feeding</b> insects and the arthropod predator community associated with tall thistle in south-central Kansas. Three questions are addressed; 1) What is the natural history of the predatory arthropod – tall thistle interaction in south-central Kansas? 2) Does apical meristem damage by insect herbivores influence host plant architecture, flower head damage and/or predatory arthropod densities? 3) Does plant architecture affect flower head damage and/or predatory arthropods? Two experiments were used to address those questions. The first experiment compared bolting tall thistles whose apical meristems were protected with insecticide with tall thistles whose apical meristems were not protected and were subject to herbivory. Damage to the apical meristem creates a plant that is shorter and has more flower heads than plants with the apical meristem intact and marginally increases primary branching. The second experiment modified the architecture of a bolting tall thistle with apical meristem damage back to a “pre-damaged” state by clipping lateral branches of the main stem. Neither experiment showed any significant difference in flower head damage severity or frequency, nor any differences in predatory arthropod densities among treatments. Through an overcompensation mechanism in the plant, meristem mining insects indirectly influence flower <b>head</b> <b>feeding</b> insects mediated by tall thistle. My results do not support the importation of multiple biological control agents for weed control...|$|R
