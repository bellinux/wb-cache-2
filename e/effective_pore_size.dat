The factors that influence permselectivity are the negative charge of the basement membrane and the podocytic epithelium, and the <b>effective</b> <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> of the glomerular wall (8 nm). As a result, large and/or negatively charged molecules will pass through far less frequently than small and/or positively charged ones.

The sample with smaller <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> exhibits a higher minimal energy (73 ± 5 meV), compared to the sample with bigger pores (48 ± 5 meV), due to the stronger confinement. The dependence of the emission energy with {{the temperature of the}} target is modeled as ortho-positronium being confined in rectangular boxes in thermodynamic equilibrium with the sample. We also measured that the yield of positronium emitted in vacuum is not affected by the temperature of the target.

In dual-mode wicking structures, liquid and vapor flow paths are integrated {{on the same}} plane and segregated flow of the two-phases is achieved by having networks of pores of multiple length-scales. When a mixture of a gas and a liquid flow through this media and the wick material wets the liquid, then the liquid will preferentially segregate to and flow through the mode with the smaller <b>effective</b> <b>pore</b> <b>size.</b> The gas will flow through the paths with the larger <b>effective</b> <b>pore</b> <b>size.</b> These wicks, further, have advantages in phase change heat exchange where the liquid can fill the entire channel.

The fluid is composed of ``simple'' spherically symmetric molecules of the Lennard-Jones type.

TFC polyamide NF membranes have been fabricated on a polyacrylonitrile support via interfacial polymerization between piperazine in an aqueous phase and trimesoyl chloride in an organic phase. Membrane characterization has revealed that the produced membranes show a NaCl retention similar to NF- 270 and Desal- 5 DK, a permeance in between those of NF- 270 and Desal- 5 DK, and a slightly higher iso-electric point than NF- 270 and Desal- 5 DK.

Organic poly(furfuryl alcohol) (PFA) was incorporated into silica walls by co-polymerization of furfuryl alcohol (FA) and silica source such as tetraethyl orthosilicate during the triblock copolymer P 123 templating process. Mesoporous silicas with wormhole pore structure were obtained by completely burning off organic polymers P 123 and PFA from the silica-P 123 -PFA nanocomposites, and their <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> and <b>pore</b> volume were increased by simply adding a certian amount of FA. TGA, N 2 sorption, SEM, TEM and FT-IR were used to characterize the silica-P 123 and silica-P 123 -PFA nanocomposites, and their final calcined mesoporous silicas. It is suggested that the P 123 templating mechanism is not changed {{by the addition of}} FA under our experimental conditions, which is evidenced by the similar pore structure and <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> in the carbonized silica-PFA nanocomposites prepared with the addition of different amount of FA. When the large amount of FA (2. 12 FA: 1 SiO 2 by mole) was used in the synthesis, the <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> was expanded from 3. 4 nm to 7. 4 nm, and the pore volume was increased from 0. 46 cm 3 /g to 1. 37 cm 3 /g.

40|$|Membrane {{processes}} {{can cover}} {{a wide range}} of separation problems [with a specific membrane (membrane structure) required for every problem]. Thus, there are membranes available that differ in their structure and consequently in the functionality. Therefore membrane characterization is necessary to ascertain, which membrane may be used for a certain separation. Membranes of <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> ranging from 100 nm to 1 μm with a uniform <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> are very important in membrane technology. An optimum performance is achieved when the membrane is as thin as possible having a uniform <b>pore</b> <b>size.</b> Here in this thesis, membranes were synthesized by particle assisted wetting using mono-layers of silica colloids as templates for pores along with polymerizable organic liquids on water surface. The <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> reflects the original shape of the particles. Thus it is possible to tune the <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> by varying the particle size. This method is <b>effective</b> to control <b>pore</b> <b>sizes</b> of membranes by choosing silica particles of suitable size. This approach gives a porous structure that is very thin, but unfortunately limited in mechanical stability. Thus {{there is a need for}} support which is robust and can withstand the various mechanical stresses. A small change in the membrane or defect in the layered structure during the membrane formation can have drastic effect on the assembly. Lateral homogeneity of the layer generated by the particle assisted wetting can be judged by examination of its reflectivity, but once it is transferred on any solid support this option is no more. So a method is needed to detect the cracks or the inhomogenity of the membrane which can be detected even after the transfer. To tackle this problem a very simple and novel technique for characterizing the membrane by fluorescence labeling and optical inspection was developed in this thesis. The idea was to add a fluorescent dye which is poorly water soluble to the spreading solution comprising of the particles and the monomer. If the dye survived the photo-cross linking, then it would be embedded in the cross-linked polymer and would serve as a marker. Defects and inhomogenity would show up as cracks and spots.

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 A {{number of}} {{investigators}} have proposed equations {{to predict the}} permeability of porous media.

Presently the <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> distributions of agricultural soils are most commonly obtained from soil water release curves. The pressure scale is converted into an equivalent pore diameter scale by means of the pressure of displacement equation. This method is time consuming. The study reported in this thesis was initiated to (1) use a mercury intrusion method to obtain <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> distributions of porous materials similar to agricultural soils, (2) use the <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> distributions thus obtained with existing equations to calculate intrinsic permeability and (3) compare the calculated permeability values with measured values for a range of particle size distributions. The permeabilities and the <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> distributions of 54 systematically selected particle size classes of glass beads and crushed quartz sand were measured. The particle size classes ranged from 44 to 246 microns in diameter. The <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> distributions were evaluated and used in Marshall's proposed permeability prediction equation. The measured permeabilities did not agree with the calculated values until a correction factor which {{is a function of the}} pore diameter was used. It is apparent that the pressure of displacement equation measures only an <b>effective</b> <b>pore</b> dimension. Permeability prediction equations require the evaluation of an effective hydraulic dimension. These two dimensions are different and are influenced by the geometry of the pore aperture.

Membrane degradation was simulated by soaking the membranes in a sodium hypochlorite solution of various concentrations over 18 h. Changes in membrane surface properties were characterised by contact angle measurement, atomic force microscopy analysis, and streaming potential measurement. The impacts of hypochlorite exposure to the membrane separation processes were ascertained by comparing the rejection of PhACs by virgin and chlorine-exposed membranes. Overall, the reverse osmosis BW 30 membrane and the tight nanofiltration NF 90 membrane were much more resilient to chlorine exposure than the larger <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> TFC-SR 2 and NF 270 nanofiltration membranes. In fact, rejection of all three PhACs selected in this study by the BW 30 remained largely unchanged after hypochlorite exposure and further characterisation did not reveal any evidence of compromised separation capability. In contrast, the effects of chlorine exposure to the two loose nanofiltration membranes were quite profound. While chlorine exposure generally resulted in reduced rejection of PhACs, a small increase in rejection was observed when a more dilute hypochlorite solution was used. Changes in the membrane surface morphology as well as observed rejection of inorganic salts and PhACs {{were found to be}} consistent with mechanisms of chlorine oxidation of polyamide membranes reported in the literature. Chlorine oxidation consistently resulted in a more negative zeta potential of all four membranes investigated in this study. Conformational alterations of the membrane polyamide active skin layer were also evident as reflected by changes in surface roughness before and after chlorine exposure. Such alterations can either loosen or tighten the <b>effective</b> membrane <b>pore</b> <b>size,</b> leading to either a decrease or an increase in rejection.

40|$|International audienceRejection rate {{measurements}} {{were carried out}} with a single polyethyleneglycol (PEG) solution and mixed PEG/inorganic salt solutions for a nanofiltration polyamide membrane. It was observed that PEG rejection is significantly lower in mixed-solute solutions, i. e. when a salt is present (KCl, LiCl, MgCl 2 and K 2 SO 4), and that rejection rate drop increases with salt concentration. Similar nanofiltration experiments were conducted with an NF ceramic membrane in previous works. The rejection of PEGs was also found to decrease {{in the presence of}} salts and this phenomenon was imputed to the partial dehydration of PEG molecules by surrounding ions (salting-out effect). Unlike results obtained with the ceramic membrane, the lowering of PEG rejection rates observed with the organic membrane does not follow the Hofmeister series. It means that the salting-out effect cannot solely explain the rejection lowering found for the organic membrane. The additional hypothesis which was considered in the present work is that the rejection lowering might be caused by an increase in the <b>effective</b> <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> (pore swelling) due to accumulation of counterions inside pores resulting from an increase in the surface charge density in the presence of ions. In order to evaluate the significance of the pore swelling phenomenon, the experimental data of rejection rates obtained with the organic membrane were used to compute the variation in the mean pore radius {{in the presence of the}} various salts (the Stokes radii of PEG molecules in the presence of the various salts having been determined previously from rejection rates obtained with the ceramic membrane). It was shown that the <b>effective</b> <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> depends on the salt nature and increases with salt concentration. The hypothesis of pore swelling was supported by electrokinetics charge density data calculated from tangential streaming potential measurements: the more the membrane surface charge density increases, the higher the effective average pore size becomes. Finally, the contribution of pore swelling and salting-out to the overall decrease in the rejection rate of PEG was evaluated...|$|E
40|$|The surface {{conductivity}} of porous rocks has two contributions: {{the first}} {{is associated with the}} diffuse layer coating the grains and is frequency-independent as long as the diffuse layer is above a percolation threshold. The second contribution is associated with the Stern layer of weakly sorbed counterions on the mineral surface and is frequency-dependent if the Stern layer is discontinuous at the scale of the representative elementary volume. In the frequency range 1 mHz- 100 Hz, this second contribution is also associated with the main polarization mechanism observed by the spectral induced polarization method in granular media (neglecting the contribution of other polarization processes like those associated with redox processes and membrane polarization). At the macroscale, we connect the Stern layer contribution to the complex conductivity and to the expectation of the probability distribution of the inverse of the grain size. This is done by performing a convolution between the probability distribution of the inverse of the grain size and the surface conductivity response obtained when all the grains have the same size. Surface conductivity at the macroscopic scale is also connected to an <b>effective</b> <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> used to characterize permeability. From these relationships, a new equation is derived connecting this <b>effective</b> <b>pore</b> <b>size,</b> the electrical formation factor, and the expected value of the probability distribution for the inverse of the grain size, which is in turn related to the distribution of the relaxation times. These new relationships are consistent with various formula derived in the literature in the limit where the grain size distribution is given by the delta function or a log normal distribution and agree fairly well with various experimental data showing also some limitations of the induced polarization method to infer permeability. One of these limitations is the difficulty to detect the relaxation, in the phase, associated with the smaller grains, as this polarization may be hidden by the Maxwell-Wagner polarization at relatively high frequencies (> 100 Hz). Also, cemented aggregates of grains can behave as coarser grains...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pore</b> <b>sizes</b> have {{traditionally}} been divided into macropores and micropores with the division between the two being arbitrary. Since most mixes used in container production are ≥ 80 % pores by volume, a more detailed pore-fraction analysis seems warranted. Taking into account hydraulic properties and irrigation parameters, pore-size distribution curves were separated into four ranges. Macropores were selected as pore sizes> 416 µ. <b>Pore</b> <b>sizes</b> within the macropore range cannot hold water under tension induced by gravity when allowed to drain after saturation. Mesopores were selected as being in the <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> range of ≤ 416 to ≥ 10 µ. Micropores were categorized into the pore-size range of 0. 2 to 10 µ. This would be equivalent to volumes of water held between 30 kPa and 1. 5 MPa. The water in these pores {{may be viewed as}} a type of water stress ÒbufferÓ not commonly used under normal irrigations but extracted by plant roots when suctions exceed 30 kPa. Ultramicropores hold water at suctions> 1. 5 MPa and would be found in <b>pores</b> with <b>effective</b> <b>pore</b> diameters < 0. 2 µ. This water would be considered unavailable to plants. Data derived from this analysis were in good agreement with traditional measures of pore space and particle size distributions for peat-based, bark-based, and soil-based substrates. 1...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of feed temperature on membrane <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> and the rejection of trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) by the nanofiltration (NF) membrane NF 270. Filtration experiments were conducted using a cross flow membrane system at 20, 30 and 40 C. The membrane pore radius was estimated using the pore hindrance transport model at each temperature and the rejection data of three reference organic solutes (i. e. erythritol, xylose and glucose) experimentally obtained in this study. The {{results suggest that the}} <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> of an NF membrane is dependent on the feed solution temperature. An increase in the feed temperature from 20 to 40 C led to an increase in the <b>effective</b> <b>pore</b> radius from 0. 39 to 0. 44 nm. Consequently, the increase in the feed temperature also caused a considerable drop in the rejection of all TrOCs investigated in this study. The decrease in rejection observed here could be attributed to not only the increase in the solute diffusivity but also the enlargement of the membrane <b>pore</b> <b>size.</b> As the feed temperature increased, the decrease in rejection of neutral TrOCs was more severe than that of negatively charged compounds. This is because in addition to size exclusion (or steric hindrance) the rejection of negatively charged TrOCs is also governed by electrostatic interaction given that the membrane surface is also negatively charged...|$|R
