5|$|For lexical-gustatory synesthesia {{evidence}} {{also points}} towards ideasthesia: In lexical-gustatory synesthesia, verbalisation {{of the stimulus}} is not necessary for the experience of concurrents. <b>Instead,</b> <b>it</b> is sufficient to activate the concept.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{building}} was not in fact demolished. <b>Instead,</b> <b>it</b> was dismantled and reconstructed in altered form at Uppingham Avenue in the north-west London suburb of Belmont as the church of St Anslelm Belmont.|$|E

5000|$|IGN UK {{concluded}} that: [...] "FM2010 isn't {{an evolutionary}} {{step in the}} series. <b>Instead</b> <b>it's</b> merely an incredibly well produced update." ...|$|R
30|$|It almost {{feels like}} there is a taboo against talking about (lower) speed limits. Kind of like it’s not really {{politically}} correct. <b>Instead</b> <b>it’s</b> important to drive fast (interview traffic safety engineer).|$|R
5|$|Managed memory {{cannot be}} {{explicitly}} freed; <b>instead,</b> <b>it</b> is automatically garbage collected. Garbage collection addresses {{the problem of}} memory leaks by freeing the programmer of responsibility for releasing memory {{that is no longer}} needed.|$|E
5|$|This section, {{unlike the}} others, does not {{directly}} generate sound. <b>Instead,</b> <b>it</b> allows users to control other gear connected via MIDI. Common parameters such as zone, channel, and volume are controllable from the Stage.|$|E
5|$|A {{music video}} {{was used as}} a {{backdrop}} projection for their Tokyo dome 2010 tour , projected on all the screens. <b>Instead,</b> <b>it</b> was released on the limited edition DVD. It featured the girls singing the song in front of the songs title. Inter cut scenes of the live performance, and the girls getting ready for the show, were included in the video.|$|E
50|$|Poster Gallery: Many of {{the posters}} of the Goofy shorts are {{presented}} here. Curiously, Maltin {{does not provide}} commentary as he usually does on the sets; <b>instead,</b> <b>it's</b> Goofy who provides the occasional comment/exclamation.|$|R
5000|$|Lo tells Justin that April is in [...] "lock up" [...] and can't be {{retrieved}} so <b>instead</b> <b>it's</b> brought two souls from Hell {{to describe}} the tortures they endure after April tricked them into selling their souls.|$|R
5000|$|Foster {{describes}} Minerva as an [...] "anti-modification": [...] "The aim isn't {{to replace}} as much game content as possible; <b>instead,</b> <b>it's</b> {{to tell my}} own apocryphal story set in the Half-Life 2 universe, and to actually release something {{for the public to}} play." ...|$|R
5|$|Built to {{a height}} of 100 metres (328ft), the PUB Building was {{completed}} in 1977; construction cost S$32 million. It was renamed as the Singapore Power Building, after PUB's electricity and gas operations were corporatised to Singapore Power on 1 October 1995. The Singapore Power Building was renovated in 2006, when Singapore Power chose not to redevelop its corporate headquarters. <b>Instead,</b> <b>it</b> opted to refurbish and reclad the building in silvery metal.|$|E

5|$|Follow the Leader is {{the third}} studio album by the American nu metal band Korn. The album was {{released}} on August 18, 1998, through Immortal/Epic. This was their first album not produced by Ross Robinson. <b>Instead,</b> <b>it</b> was produced by Steve Thompson and Toby Wright.|$|E

50|$|Sandy: A rip-off of Glover, {{this hand}} monster throws back any bomb thrown at it. Don't throw {{anything}} at <b>it</b> (trap <b>it,</b> <b>instead),</b> and <b>it's</b> a cakewalk of a monster.|$|R
5000|$|Siberry {{did not yet}} {{display the}} new wave pop style {{that would make her}} a {{household}} name in Canada with her next album, 1984's No Borders Here. <b>Instead,</b> <b>it's</b> a largely folk-pop album, which has been described by critics as [...] "post-punk Joni Mitchell".|$|R
5|$|Highly {{combustible}} materials that leave little residue, such as wood or coal, {{were thought to}} be made mostly of phlogiston; non-combustible substances that corrode, such as iron, contained very little. Air did not play a role in phlogiston theory, nor were any initial quantitative experiments conducted to test the idea; <b>instead,</b> <b>it</b> was based on observations of what happens when something burns, that most common objects appear to become lighter and seem to lose something in the process.|$|E
5|$|In African antelopes, {{the lateral}} dental {{grooming}} apparatus {{does not appear}} to be used during grazing or browsing. <b>Instead,</b> <b>it</b> is used during grooming when the head sweeps upward in a distinctive motion. It is thought to comb the fur and remove ectoparasites.|$|E
5|$|It was {{formerly}} {{thought that the}} dust was {{left over from the}} formation of the cluster, but at the age of about 100 million years generally accepted for the cluster, almost all the dust originally present would have been dispersed by radiation pressure. <b>Instead,</b> <b>it</b> seems that the cluster is simply passing through a particularly dusty region of the interstellar medium.|$|E
5000|$|Stack Records {{gave the}} album 4.5 out of 5, saying [...] "Thirteen {{could have been}} a self-indulgent mess. <b>Instead,</b> <b>it’s</b> perhaps Reyne’s finest solo album and one of the year’s best." [...] adding [...] "it is the sound of an artist coming to terms with his past." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Ron Wynn states [...] "This isn't another hard bop outing or a {{completely}} free-wheeling session; <b>instead,</b> <b>it's</b> got elements of both, and a departure as well. It requires close scrutiny and a completely open mind, because Dave Douglas is following no direction except his own".|$|R
5000|$|Surgery {{has been}} {{generally}} well-received by critics. Drowned in Sound wrote: [...] "Surgery isn't the unlistenable, depression-fest it's [...] lyrical content threatens <b>it</b> to be. <b>Instead,</b> <b>it's</b> heartfelt message {{combined with the}} monstrous sound behind it make {{it one of the}} most curiously uplifting records of the year." ...|$|R
5|$|Laika {{died within}} hours from overheating, {{possibly}} {{caused by a}} failure of the central R-7 sustainer to separate from the payload.

When interviewed during the off-season, Stivetts claimed {{that he would like to}} quit pitching and play first, that is if a team would give him the opportunity. Selee, Boston's manager, disagreed and claimed that the team needed Stivetts in the pitching rotation <b>instead.</b> <b>It</b> was also likely that he would have received less salary playing at first.|$|E
5|$|Outside film festivals, {{the first}} release in the USA {{was at the}} Olde Mistick Village theater in Filardi's {{hometown}} of Mystic, Connecticut, on 22 December 2006.

50|$|Brian Marwood {{has been}} Football Administration Officer' since March 2009. Then Manager Mark Hughes was {{concerned}} about the club bringing someone in a Director of Football role and thus Football Administration Officer was the title given <b>instead.</b> <b>Its</b> main role signing transfer targets, whilst improving the club's infrastructure off the pitch.|$|R
5000|$|Conspiracy was a {{commercial}} success and received mixed critical reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic wrote [...] "Considering Ready to Die {{was one of}} the seminal hip-hop releases of the early '90s, Conspiracy could have been an inspired, enjoyable sequel; <b>instead,</b> <b>it's</b> a fitfully successful replication of the earlier record's strengths." ...|$|R
50|$|Speed glue is an {{adhesive}} used {{to assemble}} table tennis rackets {{in a manner}} to make them hit balls back with increased speed. It is optional; a person may choose to use regular glue <b>instead.</b> <b>Its</b> use in tournaments is currently disputed due to believed toxicity in some speed glues.|$|R
5|$|Robson's {{success with}} Ipswich had {{attracted}} the attention of many bigger clubs, and he had been linked with the Manchester United job when Dave Sexton was sacked in May 1981, but the job went to Ron Atkinson <b>instead.</b> <b>It</b> was the Football Association who lured Robson away from Portman Road a year later, when he accepted their offer to manage the England national team in July 1982.|$|E
5|$|September 13–14, 1997: Hurricane Linda was at {{one point}} {{forecast}} to make landfall in southern California. <b>Instead,</b> <b>it</b> moved out to sea, although large waves caused by Linda did wash five people off a jetty in Newport Beach. Also, Linda's outer rainbands generated thunderstorms over southern California, causing flash floods in some regions.|$|E
5|$|The American economy, however, {{does not}} require a labor force {{consisting}} solely of professionals. <b>Instead</b> <b>it</b> requires a greatly diverse and specialized labor force. Thus the majority of Americans complete assigned tasks with considerably less autonomy and creative freedom than professionals, leading to theory that they may better be described as being members of the working class.|$|E
5000|$|Larb Lanna - drier and smokier in taste, {{northern}} Thai larb {{does not}} contain lime or fish sauce. <b>Instead</b> <b>it's</b> flavoured and seasoned with an elaborate mix of ground dried chillies, dried spices like cumin, cloves, long pepper, star anise, Sichuan pepper, cinnamon, and occasionally blood of the animal used.|$|R
