5000|$|The {{following}} are iterative methods for finding the reciprocal square root of S which is [...] Once {{it has been}} <b>found,</b> <b>find</b> [...] by simple multiplication: [...] These iterations involve only multiplication, and not division. They are therefore faster than the Babylonian method. However, they are not stable. If the initial value is not close to the reciprocal square root, the iterations will diverge away from it rather than converge to it. It can therefore be advantageous to perform an iteration of the Babylonian method on a rough estimate before starting to apply these methods.|$|E
