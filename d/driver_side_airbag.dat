5000|$|... 1993 {{model year}} Canadian-spec Corollas from Japan {{were sold in}} Chile because no Latin American models met {{emission}} standards by then. They featured a higher trim than most of its rivals at the time, since they all came with standard <b>driver</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag,</b> larger bumpers, polycarbonate headlamp lenses. For the 1994 model year, a lower trim model was sold instead.|$|E
50|$|The four {{wheel drive}} system {{introduced}} on this generation was borrowed from the Toyota Celica GT-Four. Four wheel steering was available. The trim level designations were 1800V, 2000X, 2000GT and 2000GT-4WD. As a result of styling changes, sales improved {{in comparison to the}} second generation. A <b>driver</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag</b> appeared September 1995, as well as speed sensitive door locks and climate control air conditioning. A passenger side airbag appeared June 1996. Production ended due to economic conditions April 1998.|$|E
50|$|In the USA, the Legacy was {{introduced}} with automatic seat belts due to United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) regulations stating that all cars produced from April 1, 1989 {{were to be}} equipped with a passive front passenger restraint system that would protect front occupants from frontal impact without occupant participation. This regulation was enacted to force manufacturers to install air bags in their vehicles. In 1992, Subaru added a <b>driver</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag</b> only (as an option) which didn't satisfy the U.S. regulation. The 1993 and 1994 models all had a <b>driver</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag</b> standard. If a vehicle had dual air bags, the passive seat belt systems could be removed, which Subaru did in 1995, with the Second Generation. The monocoque body integrated a steel safety cage that surrounded the passenger compartment, with collapsible engine and trunk sections for added passenger protection. Steel beams were added inside {{the front and rear}} door to protect passengers from side collisions. To increase the rigidity of the front and rear bumpers, a styrofoam insert is added, which is used on vehicles sold only in North America.|$|E
50|$|A final {{facelift}} to {{the middle}} model occurred in May 1995 {{with the addition of}} a <b>driver's</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag</b> and a change of alloy wheels amongst other minor details.|$|R
50|$|In late 1995, a <b>driver's</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag</b> {{was added}} {{as well as}} {{compliance}} with the new US safety rules. Rear wheel ABS came with both 2WD and 4WD models beginning in 1990.|$|R
25|$|The Mark VII, {{launched}} in 1996, {{was the final}} version of the original two-door Mini. For this model twin point injection with front-mounted radiator was introduced, along with a full-width dashboard and <b>driver's</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1981, the W126 {{introduced}} a <b>driver</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag,</b> as patented by Mercedes-Benz in 1971, {{as well as}} the passenger side airbags (in 1988), seat-belt pretensioners, and traction control. It was the first production car to feature an airbag standard, and as late as 1991 {{there were only a few}} other manufacturers in Europe who offered an airbag. The interior featured additional courtesy and reading lamps, along with heated seats and a more advanced climate control system. A four-speed automatic transmission was standard.|$|E
5000|$|Airbags, as an {{additional}} measure of occupant protection. The <b>driver</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag</b> premiered on 1981 models, as an optional extra (standard from 1985 on 500 SEL and 500 SEC), and the passenger side airbag premiered in 1987 and became available in February 1988 (as an optional extra; due to its expense, few early production W126 cars were thus equipped). The passenger side airbag became standard in 1989 for the U.S. V8 models and was made standard in 1990 for all 1991 models.|$|E
50|$|Inside, {{more than}} 90 {{percent of the}} VT's {{electrical}} and HVAC components were new over the VS, except for the carry-over column stalks. Safety wise, Holden relied on more computer simulations than ever before (with the aid of crash research from the Monash University Accident Research Centre), resulting in only 20 VTs being physically crash tested, compared to 55 with the previous VR series. A <b>driver</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag</b> was standard across all models, along with a passenger side optional only on the Commodore Executive and S. Side airbags with torso and head protection became an option for the Acclaim and higher models from 1998 (a first for Holden and Australian manufactured vehicles).|$|E
2500|$|Several {{models in}} the 2001â€“2003 years were {{the subject of a}} [...] in July 2009 for {{injuries}} reported by faulty <b>driver's</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag</b> inflators. In February 2010, another recall was issued for the same problem.|$|R

5000|$|The Legend offered many Honda [...] "firsts", {{such as a}} <b>driver</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag,</b> {{vehicle speed}} {{sensitive}} power assist rack and pinon steering, anti-lock brakes, seat belt pre-tensioners with Emergency Locking Retractors (called E.L.R.), a choice of 100% wool or cloth moquette upholstery, and [...] "TCS" [...] Traction control, the first car to use traction control on a front wheel drive vehicle. Attention was given {{to make sure the}} Legend was quiet, so Honda used computer simulation using NASTRAN, a stress analysis program created by NASA, helping the car achieve a drag coefficient of 0.32 and an interior noise level of 63 dB (measured while the vehicle was travelling at 100 km/h using a manual transmission in 5th gear), and by using triple seals around the tops of door openings.|$|E
50|$|Honda started local {{production}} {{and sale of}} Fit in April 2003 when Brazil became the second production base, after Japan, for Fit. In Brazil, though initially was available with the 1.3 L i-DSI engine only, eventually the Fit has the same engines as the Japanese models (all Brazilian Honda cars have engines imported from Japan) and there are three trim levels available. Base model LX features the 1.35 i-DSI engine (which is marketed as 1.4 in Brazil) and <b>driver</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag.</b> The second model in the range, the LXL, features the same engine from the LX, but adds some extra equipment: passenger side airbag and ABS. Top model EX has essentially the same equipment as the LXL, but comes with the 1.5 VTEC engine. All models are available with the five-speed manual or the regular CVT automatic. There are neither side airbags nor side curtains available for the Brazilian version. Also, the radio antenna is positioned differently, as it is {{near the front of}} the roof. Honda started selling the 2007 model in February 2006 with new bumpers and some cosmetic changes.|$|E
5000|$|Silver {{being the}} rarest with only 258 being made {{followed}} by black. 1989 saw {{the introduction of}} the ES model offered with silver contrasting ground affects, along [...] "snowflake" [...] patterned rim design. The 2.2 Turbo I was replaced with the 2.5 Turbo I, rated at 150 hp and 170 ft. lbs. of torque. ES was offered as an appearance package/equipment group on base models in order to attract the [...] "average" [...] Daytona buyerâ€™s eye without a major price hike. Also introduced in 1989 was the AGS C/S Competition model, which was featured along with the regular AGB model. This new model of C/S featured an intercooled 2.2 turbo II engine, along with many other features that were also on the Shelby. However, this model was only available with a manual transmission. The AGS C/S package would remain in availability until 1991. The AGB C/S Performance model had the 2.5 non-intercooled turbo I engine available with 5 speed manual or 3 speed automatic. <b>Driver</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag</b> was standard.|$|E
5000|$|Safety {{equipment}} includes dual front airbags, {{anti-lock braking}} system, {{electronic brakeforce distribution}} and front pretensioner seat belts. The <b>driver's</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag</b> feature multi-stage inflation. The front body is designed to absorb impact energy for better pedestrian protection.|$|R
50|$|In 1993, GM debuted {{the first}} power side sliding {{door in a}} {{passenger}} vehicle. Due to quality control problems, the option never became available in production models until 1994. 1994 Trans Sports also debuted a <b>driver's</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 1989 - Final year of production. <b>Driver's</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag</b> is standard. At {{the time}} the Fifth Avenue (as well as its M body twins) {{was one of the}} only cars that offered an airbag with a tilt {{steering}} wheel.|$|R
5000|$|For the 1998 model year, a {{gasoline}} engine was offered, a Mitsubishi derived 4G64 [...] at 5,250 rpm with 218 Nm of torque at 4,000 rpm. The diesel engine now {{comes with a}} slightly more powerful Mitsubishi derived 4D56 non-intercooled turbo diesel engine with [...] at 201 Nm at 2,000 rpm.

A long wheelbase (12-seater) [...] "Jumbo" [...] and short wheelbase (seven- and nine-seater) [...] "RV" [...] was also available. First introduced to this model are luxurious features like side lower body cladding with two-tone paint scheme (SVX, Club), optional dual sunroof (Club), side body [...] "Tetris style" [...] decals (Club), chrome slant grills, rear tailgate handle opener cover (Club), cream moquette upholstery (Club), optional high-tech head unit with television screen and six-disc CD changer (Club) for domestic models, power windows and antenna (SVX, Club) an Aisin Seiki Co. sourced four-speed automatic transmission with ECT and overdrive switch and differently styled [...] "star" [...] 15-inch alloy wheels with exposed lug nuts (Club). For safety, it also features limited-slip differential (LSD), anti-lock braking system (ABS) and <b>driver</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag.</b> This models was exported to a number countries and proved a big hit to some car markets like the Philippines where at that time was imported via gray market. It gained instant popularity for comfortable sedan-like drive, availability of automatic transmission, expansive interior space and thickly bolstered seats. Its main advantage was being priced lower than its twin, the Mitsubishi Delica Space Gear, yet it packed more features and factory accessories like front bull bars, top basket loader, and a rear ladder. For the following year in the Philippines, the gasoline engine version was dropped due to unusually high gasoline consumption, but still made available for other markets.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a finite element computer simulation of a New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) full scale crash test. The full scale test selected {{for this study}} is a 30 mph frontal impact of a 1993 Ford Taurus vehicle into a rigid flat wall. Finite element models of a Ford Taurus vehicle, a Hybrid III dummy, and a <b>driver</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag</b> were combined to simulate the test. The vehicle, dummy, and airbag models are described in detail. The combined model validation against the full scale test is also presented. The combined model validation focuses on the comparison of the test and simulations in terms of crush depth {{in the front of}} the vehicle, the acceleration at different locations of the vehicle as well as the head and chest accelerations and the femur loads of the dummy. The simulation results are found to be consistent and in good agreement with the crash test data. Recommendations for further improvements of the model are also included in this paper.

40|$|For {{assessment}} of their performance and {{for the development of}} injury risk functions {{there is a need for}} additional biofidelity data. In this report two types of data are made available: Part A - post mortem human subject exposed to various restraints; Part B â€“ volunteer shoulder rang-of-motions. Part A LAB- 2002 : Load-limiting belt restraints have been present in cars since 1995. An accident study showed the greater effectiveness in thorax injury prevention using a 4 kN load limiter belt with an airbag than using a 6 kN load limiter belt without airbag. Frontal sled crashes were performed using PMHS. Restraint conditions evaluated are 6 kN load-limiting belt and 4 kN load-limiting belt with an airbag. Loads between the occupant and the sled environment were recorded. Various measurements characterize the PMHS behaviour and injuries were noted. LAB- 2005 : Many studies have reported multiple rib fractures sustained by an Out-of-Position (OOP) driver subjected to a frontal airbag deployment. Two successive phases occur during the bag deployment: punch-out loading of the thorax, followed by a membrane effect. The aim of this study was to investigate the thoracic injuries generated by each phase separately. Tests of nine post-mortem human surrogates were carried out on a static test bench using a <b>driver</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag</b> module. Three loading configurations were performed: membrane only, punch-out only, and both types combined. The membrane-only tests were performed with the thorax initially positioned at 13, 78 and 128 mm from the plate in order to vary the load magnitude. The punch-out and the combined tests were performed with the thorax initially 8 mm from the module. Accelerometers and angular rate sensors were fixed on the sternum and on the first, fourth, and eighth thoracic vertebrae of the PMHS. Ribs 2 to 6 were instrumented with strain gauges. The reaction force of the bag on the plate was measured using four 2 -axis load cells. Results showed that both pure punch-out and pure membrane loading can result in thoracic injuries. However, the rib fracture locations seemed to differ from one type of loading to the other. Moreover, for the same initial distance between the airbag module and the thorax, the injuries were more severe in the combined effect tests than in the pure punch-out or pure membrane. LAB- 2008 : Ribs of 8 PMHS were equipped with up to 96 strain gauges. In a first series of 3 tests, the subjects were seated upright and their chests were loaded by a 23. 4 kg impactor propelled at 4. 3 m/s in pure frontal, oblique and pure lateral directions. In a second series of 3 tests, the subjects were loaded by the deployment of an unfolded airbag in the same 3 directions. Part B The shoulder complex is rarely exposed to injuries in frontal and oblique frontal collisions, but influence the belt interaction and as such the thorax compression and head kinematics. The purpose of this study was to establish response requirements for the shoulder complex in terms of range-of-motion and stiffness. Six male volunteers were seated in a rigid seat that simulated a car driverâ€™s posture whilst in a special designed test rig. Loads to the shoulders were applied through the arms, by means of brackets fastened to the elbows, loads rearward were applied by means of a strap around the shoulder complex. Torso movement was blocked by two pre-tensed diagonal belts that were routed close to the neck to avoid excessive clavicle interaction. Shoulders were loaded with increasing load from 0 Ì¶ 200 N/shoulder at 50 N increments. A test series included four load series: shoulders pulled straight forward, forward-upward, upward and rearward. Each volunteer was exposed to three tests. Shoulder positions relative to the spine were obtained from film analysis. Photo markers were mounted on the volunteerâ€™s skin: head, posterior tip of acromion process, chest, T 1 and T 4. The right and left acromion relative to T 1 displacements were used to calculate the shoulder range-of-motion in three directions. Belt loads and seat back loads were recorded. Average resultant volunteersâ€™ acromion relative to T 1 range-of-motion, at the maximum load, was 55 mm for forward loads, 69 mm for forward-upward loads, 73 for mm upward loads and 50 mm for rearward loads. The volunteers provided measurements with reasonable repeatability. The volunteers curved their spines only slightly when shoulder loads were applied. Hence, shoulder complex motion was successfully isolated and results reflect pure shoulder relative to chest motions. The applied loads were lower than those commonly seen in frontal crashes, however the shoulder is highly mobile and its response to loads is largely dependent on muscle characteristics. As such studies using volunteers may be complimentary to tests with post mortem human subjects...|$|E
50|$|Hatchback {{body style}} was dropped after 1991 model. The Corsica {{received}} an extensively updated interior {{with a standard}} <b>driver's</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag</b> and cup holders. Front seatbelts were moved from {{the doors to the}} B-pillars. The taillights received a redesign, from smooth to ridged.|$|R
50|$|When <b>driver</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbags</b> became {{mandatory}} on all {{passenger vehicles}} in model year 1995, most manufacturers stopped equipping cars with automatic seat belts. Exceptions include the 1995-1996 Ford Escort/Mercury Tracer and the Eagle Summit Wagon which had automatic safety belts along with dual airbags.|$|R
50|$|Dynasty {{models were}} all {{equipped}} with a <b>driver's</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag</b> starting in 1990. A Bendix anti-lock braking system was available on all models during those years as well. The 1993 models were the only year to feature a stainless steel exhaust system and a tamper-proof odometer.|$|R
