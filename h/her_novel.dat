5|$|Stowe {{mentioned}} {{a number of}} the inspirations and sources for <b>her</b> <b>novel</b> in A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin (1853). This non-fiction book was intended to verify Stowe's claims about slavery. However, later research indicated that Stowe did not read many of the book's cited works until after she had published <b>her</b> <b>novel.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bleecker's {{pastoral}} {{poetry is}} studied by historians to gain perspective {{of life on}} the front lines of the revolution, and <b>her</b> <b>novel</b> Maria Kittle, the first known Captivity novel, set the form for subsequent Indian Capture novels which saw great popularity after her death.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1920s Radclyffe Hall drew a crowd after <b>her</b> <b>novel</b> The Well of Loneliness had been {{banned in the}} UK. A reading by poet Edna St. Vincent Millay packed the salon in 1932. At another Friday salon in the 1930s Virgil Thomson sang from Four Saints in Three Acts, an opera based on a {{libretto}} by Gertrude Stein.|$|E
5|$|It portrayed Hall as a humourless moralist {{who had a}} {{great deal}} in common with the opponents of <b>her</b> <b>novel.</b> One illustration, picking up on the theme of {{religious}} martyrdom in The Well, showed Hall nailed to a cross. The image horrified Hall; her guilt at being depicted in a drawing that she saw as blasphemous led to her choice of a religious subject for her next novel, The Master of the House.|$|E
5|$|Willis {{embedded}} his {{own personality}} into his writing and addressed his readers personally, specifically in his travel writings, {{so that his}} reputation was built {{in part because of}} his character. Critics, including his sister in <b>her</b> <b>novel</b> Ruth Hall, occasionally described him as being effeminate and Europeanized. Willis also published several poems, tales, and a play. Despite his intense popularity for a time, at his death Willis was nearly forgotten.|$|E

Most of <b>her</b> <b>novels</b> were republished under the Harlequin imprint, sometimes with different titles. <b>Her</b> first <b>novels</b> were popular doctor-nurse romances; love triangles frequently feature in her plots, {{and she also}} set <b>her</b> <b>novels</b> in Italy or Spain.|$|R

5|$|After reading The Last Tycoon, Zelda {{began working}} on a new novel of her own, Caesar's Things. As she had missed Scott's funeral, so she missed Scottie's wedding. By August 1943 she had {{returned}} to the Highland Hospital. She worked on <b>her</b> <b>novel</b> while checking {{in and out of the}} hospital. She did not get better, nor did she finish the novel. On the night of March 10, 1948, a fire broke out in the hospital kitchen. Zelda was locked into a room, awaiting electroshock therapy. The fire moved through the dumbwaiter shaft, spreading onto every floor. The fire escapes were wooden, and they caught fire as well. Nine women, including Zelda, died.|$|E
5|$|Almost all reviewers commented {{upon the}} {{timeliness}} of the book's release as {{the magnitude and}} causes {{of the most recent}} financial crisis were becoming apparent. Some reviewers also commented upon the timeliness of her previous books, like <b>her</b> <b>novel</b> in which society is devastated by a genetically engineered virus, Oryx and Crake, which coincided with the SARS outbreak. Playing off this theme Canadian magazine The Walrus, at a fund-raiser gala for its charitable foundation, auctioned a crystal decanter with five predictions written by Atwood sealed inside. Journalist Rebecca Eckler was the winning bidder and wrote about the predictions, which include the diminished use of fabric softener and the rise in use of industrial hemp, in an article for Maclean's magazine.|$|E
5|$|Godwin {{attended}} Peace College in Raleigh, North Carolina from 1955 to 1957. She {{then transferred}} to University of North Carolina (UNC), where she attended from 1957 to 1959, graduating with a bachelor's degree in journalism. While in college she worked on The Otherwise Virgins, a novel her mother had written, {{but was unable to}} find a publisher for. In 1959 Knopf sent an agent to UNC to scout young writers. Godwin submitted a portion of <b>her</b> <b>novel</b> Windy Peaks for their consideration. The story was about the staff and guests at a resort hotel in the mountains. Her manuscript was rejected. Godwin also worked as a waitress at Mayview Manor at Blowing Rock, North Carolina during her sophomore and junior years.|$|E

5|$|Heyer {{essentially}} {{established the}} historical romance genre and its subgenre Regency romance. Her Regencies {{were inspired by}} Jane Austen, but unlike Austen, who wrote about and for the times in which she lived, Heyer was forced to include copious information about the period so that her readers would understand the setting. To ensure accuracy, Heyer collected reference works and kept detailed notes on all aspects of Regency life. While some critics thought the novels were too detailed, others considered the level of detail to be Heyer's greatest asset. Her meticulous nature was also evident in her historical novels; Heyer even recreated William the Conqueror's crossing into England for <b>her</b> <b>novel</b> The Conqueror.|$|E
5|$|In 1816, {{the couple}} famously spent a summer with Lord Byron, John William Polidori, and Claire Clairmont near Geneva, Switzerland, where Mary {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} <b>her</b> <b>novel</b> Frankenstein. The Shelleys left Britain in 1818 for Italy, where their second and third children died before Mary Shelley {{gave birth to her}} last and only surviving child, Percy Florence Shelley. In 1822, her husband drowned when his sailing boat sank during a storm near Viareggio. A year later, Mary Shelley returned to England and from then on devoted herself to the upbringing of her son and a career as a professional author. The last decade of her life was dogged by illness, probably caused by the brain tumour that was to kill her at the age of 53.|$|E
5|$|Ng, {{who is a}} stay at home mother, {{writes in}} her spare time at home. Her topics are {{different}} depending on the genre she is writing in; her adult-oriented works often deal with minority groups, while her children's books are meant to teach empathy. Her children's works have won three Adhikarya Awards from the Indonesian Publishers Association, and LGBT groups have praised <b>her</b> <b>novel</b> Gerhana Kembar (Twin Eclipse; 2007) for avoiding stereotyping the group. However, some educators have protested {{the lack of an}} explicit moral message in her children's books.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the classic}} account of slaves that escaped on the Underground Railroad was Harriet Beecher Stowe's fictional work, Uncle Tom's Cabin, which relates the story of Eliza Harris, a young slave girl who escaped the South by {{crossing}} the Ohio River on a winter night. Barefooted and carrying her baby, the fictional Eliza was exhausted and nearly dead when she reached safety. After receiving food, clothing, new shoes, and shelter from Stowe's fictional Quaker couple, Simeon and Rachael Halliday, Eliza continued her journey to freedom in Canada. Stow, who {{was living in the}} city at the time, was acquainted with the Coffins, who may have been the inspiration for the Halliday couple in <b>her</b> <b>novel.</b>|$|E
5|$|She bequeathed most of {{her money}} to her Society. During Fortune's lifetime, some of the Fraternity members had {{expressed}} concerns {{with regard to the}} organisation becoming a personality cult revolving around her, and so following her death they did not encourage an interest in her biography. Members of the society have alleged that her successor destroyed {{most of her}} diaries, correspondences, and photographs. However, a number of her books would be published posthumously, among them The Cosmic Doctrine, which appeared in 1949, and <b>her</b> <b>novel</b> Moon Magic, published in 1956.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft's ideas became {{associated}} {{with her life}} story and women writers {{felt that it was}} dangerous to mention her in their texts. Hays, who had previously been a close friend and an outspoken advocate for Wollstonecraft and her Rights of Woman, for example, did not include her in the collection of Illustrious and Celebrated Women she published in 1803. Maria Edgeworth specifically distances herself from Wollstonecraft in <b>her</b> <b>novel</b> Belinda (1802); she caricatures Wollstonecraft as a radical feminist in the character of Harriet Freke. But, like Jane Austen, she does not reject Wollstonecraft's ideas. Both Edgeworth and Austen argue that women are crucial {{to the development of the}} nation; moreover, they portray women as rational beings who should choose companionate marriage.|$|E
5000|$|Fielding sets most of <b>her</b> <b>novels</b> in American {{cities such}} as Boston and Chicago. She has said that she prefers to set <b>her</b> <b>novels</b> in [...] "big American cities, the {{landscape}} seems best for her themes of urban alienation and loss of identity." ...|$|R
5000|$|Young {{describes}} <b>her</b> <b>novels</b> as concerning [...] "the {{concept of}} the evolved woman‚Äîone who's able to look her personal demons {{in the eye and}} solve her problems...regardless."

5|$|A {{number of}} Welsh writers have {{drawn on the}} lives of the quarrymen for their material, for example the novels of T. Rowland Hughes. Chwalfa, {{translated}} into English as Out of their night (1954), has the Penrhyn Quarry dispute as a background, while Y cychwyn, translated as The beginning (1969), follows the apprenticeship of a young quarryman. Several novels by Kate Roberts, the daughter of a quarryman, give a picture of the area around Rhosgadfan, where the slate industry was on a smaller scale and many of the quarrymen were also smallholders. <b>Her</b> <b>novel</b> Traed mewn cyffion (1936), translated as Feet in chains (2002), gives a vivid picture of the struggles of a quarrying family in the period between 1880 and 1914. Y Chwarelwr ("The Quarryman") produced in 1935 was the first Welsh-language film. It showed various aspects of a slate quarryman's life at Blaenau Ffestiniog.|$|E
5|$|After {{spending}} {{two months}} in Batna with Ehnni, the French ordered her to leave North Africa without explanation; as an immigrant, {{she had no choice}} but to comply. Ehnni requested permission from his military superiors to marry Eberhardt (which would have enabled her to stay), but his request was denied. She traveled to France in early May 1901, staying with Augustin and his wife and daughter in Marseille. In mid-June she was summoned back to Constantine to give evidence at the trial of her attacker, who maintained his statement that God had ordered him to kill Eberhardt, though expressed remorse towards her. Eberhardt said that she bore no grudge against Abdallah, forgave him, and hoped that he would not be punished. Abdallah received life imprisonment although the prosecutor had asked for the death penalty. When the trial ended, Eberhardt was again ordered to leave the country. She returned to live with Augustin, working with him (disguised as a man) as a dock labourer. Eberhardt and Augustin's family lived in appalling poverty. Eberhardt's health deteriorated, and she repeatedly suffered from fevers. She attempted suicide while in Marseille, one of several unsuccessful attempts she would make over the course of her life. Eberhardt continued to write during this time, working on several projects including <b>her</b> <b>novel</b> Trimardeur.|$|E
5|$|Atwood was {{scheduled}} to release her new novel in fall 2008 and deliver the Massey Lectures in fall 2009. At the insistence of Atwood's American editor at Doubleday, her Canadian and British editors and agents agreed in January 2008 to postpone the release of <b>her</b> <b>novel</b> by one year to avoid competing with the US Presidential election for attention. The people organizing the Massey Lectures, Sarah McLachlan of House of Anansi Press, John Fraser of Massey College, and Bernie Lucht of CBC's Ideas, discovered this rescheduling via a newspaper article. They asked Atwood to deliver her lectures in fall 2008, meaning the text would be due in June. She agreed on condition of Massey College providing research and technical assistance. The text was written between late January and June 2008, during which Atwood took time for two vacations (birding in Cuba and in France). The original title was to be Debt but Scott Griffin, owner of House of Anansi Press, convinced Atwood to change it to something less depressing.|$|E
