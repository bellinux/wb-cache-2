5|$|Belfast {{arrived in}} Singapore on 16 December 1959, and {{spent most of}} 1960 at sea on exercise, calling at ports in Hong Kong, Borneo, India, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Australia, the Philippines and Japan. On 31 January 1961, Belfast re{{commission}}ed, under the command of Captain Morgan Morgan-Giles. On her final foreign commission Belfast joined a number of <b>exercises</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Far East, and in December 1961 she provided the British guard of honour at Tanganyika's independence ceremony in Dar-es-Salaam.|$|E
5|$|Wisconsin {{spent the}} first part of 1989 {{conducting}} training <b>exercises</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic Ocean and off the coast of Puerto Rico before returning to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for a post recommissioning shakedown that lasted the rest of the year. In mid-1990 the battleship participated in a fleet exercise.|$|E
5|$|After her {{training}} <b>exercises</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic and the Pacific were finished, New Mexico was overhauled and modernized at the Philadelphia Harbor by the Navy from March 1931 to January 1933. The overhaul included {{the replacement of}} her turbo-electric drive with more conventional geared turbines, which were made by Curtis. In addition, New Mexico received eight 5-inch/25 caliber anti-aircraft guns, replacing the four 3-inch/50 caliber guns that had been previously installed. After the overhaul, she returned the Pacific to continue training exercises {{and the development of}} tactical operations.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the British visit, the 1905 autumn {{maneuvers}} were shortened considerably, from 6 to 13 September, and consisted only of <b>exercises</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North Sea. The first exercise presumed a naval blockade in the German Bight, and the second envisioned a hostile fleet attempting to force the defenses of the Elbe. During October, Kaiser Wilhelm II conducted individual training and, in November, joined the rest of the I Squadron for a cruise in the Baltic. In early December, the I and II Squadrons went on their regular winter cruise, this time to Danzig, where they arrived on 12 December. While on the return trip to Kiel, the fleet conducted tactical exercises.|$|E
5|$|As part {{of their}} regular {{training}} activities, F/A-18 Hornets operate {{in different parts of}} Australia and the Asia-Pacific region. Regular deployments are made to Singapore and RMAF Butterworth in Malaysia as part of Integrated Air Defence System exercises. In addition, RAAF F/A-18s have participated in <b>exercises</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Philippines, Thailand and the United States. These deployments have seen Australian fighter squadrons range as far afield as Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska, where they took part in Red Flag – Alaska exercises in 2008 and 2011.|$|E
5|$|Between 7 June and 26 August, New Jersey formed part of {{the first}} {{training}} squadron to cruise Northern European waters since the beginning of World War II. Over two thousand United States Naval Academy and NROTC midshipmen received seagoing experience under the command of Admiral Richard L. Connolly, Commander Naval Forces Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean, who broke his flag in New Jersey at Rosyth, Scotland 23 June. She was the scene of official receptions at Oslo, where King Haakon VII of Norway inspected the crew 2 July, and at Portsmouth, England. The training fleet was westward bound 18 July for <b>exercises</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Caribbean and Western Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|Blücher {{spent most}} of November 1939 fitting out and {{finishing}} additional improvements. By {{the end of the}} month, the ship was ready for sea trials; she steamed to Gotenhafen in the Baltic Sea. The trials lasted until mid-December, after which the ship returned to Kiel for final modifications. In January 1940, she resumed her <b>exercises</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Baltic, but {{by the middle of the}} month, severe ice forced the ship to remain in port. On 5 April, she was deemed to be ready for action, and was therefore assigned to the forces participating in the invasion of Norway.|$|E
5|$|Bordeaux was an {{important}} port for the German war effort, receiving {{a great deal of}} cargo, mostly raw materials, from overseas. It was also a major naval base, with huge submarine pens for U-boats. The Gironde estuary and Bordeaux had already been a target for the Allies. Operation Frankton was a 1942 commando raid targeting important shipping in the port. In January 1944, the Allies intercepted communications indicating that German commanders were concerned by the possibility of landings in the Bay of Biscay region of France. The next month, German naval and air units undertook anti-invasion <b>exercises</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area. Ironside was intended to amplify these concerns.|$|E
5|$|By 1910, {{the first}} {{dreadnought}} battleships began to enter service with the German fleet, rendering older vessels like Brandenburg obsolescent. That year, she temporarily returned to service with the III Squadron {{to take part}} in the annual fleet maneuvers. After the exercises ended, she returned to what was now the Reserve Division of the North Sea, where she conducted further training. In mid-1911, she was transferred to the Training and Experimental Ships Unit, where she participated in training <b>exercises</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Baltic. Brandenburg again temporarily returned to the III Squadron for the fleet maneuvers in August and September, and on 16 October she was again decommissioned. In 1912, she was allocated to the Marinestation der Ostsee, where she remained inactive for the following two years.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, the new US President Ronald Reagan {{pursued a}} hard line {{approach}} to Libya, erroneously claiming it to be puppet regime of the Soviet Union. In turn, Gaddafi played up his commercial relationship with the Soviets, visiting Moscow again in April 1981 and 1985, and in 1978 threatening to join the Warsaw Pact. The Soviets were nevertheless cautious of Gaddafi, seeing him as an unpredictable extremist. Beginning military <b>exercises</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Sirte – an area of sea that Libya claimed {{as a part of}} its territorial waters – in August 1981 the US shot down two Libyan Su-22 planes monitoring them. Closing down Libya's embassy in Washington, D.C., Reagan advised US companies operating in the country {{to reduce the number of}} American personnel stationed there. In March 1982, the US implemented an embargo of Libyan oil, and in January 1986 ordered all US companies to cease operating in the country, although several hundred workers remained when the Libyan government doubled their pay. Diplomatic relations also broke down with the UK, after Libyan diplomats were accused in the killing of Yvonne Fletcher, a British policewoman stationed outside their London embassy, in April 1984. In Spring 1986, the US Navy again began performing <b>exercises</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Sirte; the Libyan military retaliated, but failed as the US sank several Libyan ships.|$|E
5|$|In September 1932, Cunningham was {{promoted}} to flag rank, and aide-de-camp to the King. He was appointed Rear Admiral (Destroyers) in the Mediterranean in December 1933 and was made a Companion of the Bath in 1934. Having hoisted his flag in the light cruiser HMS Coventry, Cunningham used his time to practice fleet handling {{for which he was}} to receive much praise in the Second World War. There were also fleet <b>exercises</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic Ocean in which he learnt the skills and values of night actions that he would also use to great effect in years to come.|$|E
5|$|In September 1952, {{the first}} major NATO {{maritime}} exercises began; Exercise Mainbrace brought together 200 ships and over 50,000 personnel to practice the defence of Denmark and Norway. Other major exercises that followed included Exercise Grand Slam and Exercise Longstep, naval and amphibious <b>exercises</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean Sea, Italic Weld, a combined air-naval-ground exercise in northern Italy, Grand Repulse, involving the British Army on the Rhine (BAOR), the Netherlands Corps and Allied Air Forces Central Europe (AAFCE), Monte Carlo, a simulated atomic air-ground exercise involving the Central Army Group, and Weldfast, a combined amphibious landing exercise in the Mediterranean Sea involving American, British, Greek, Italian and Turkish naval forces.|$|E

5|$|In late July, Wichita {{went into}} drydock at the Royal Navy base in Rosyth, Scotland. Repairs, which {{included}} correcting a propeller shaft vibration, lasted from 24 July until 9 August. The repairs to the propeller shaft were ineffective, however, which necessitated {{a return to}} the United States. She reached the New York Navy Yard on 22 August for repairs, which lasted until 5 September. She completed a round of post-repair sea trials before conducting gunnery <b>exercises</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Chesapeake Bay. Wichita conducted training off the Virginia Capes {{for the rest of the}} month, after which she steamed to Casco Bay in Maine for further maneuvers.|$|E
5|$|McDougal resumed duty {{along the}} east coast and, during May, {{provided}} part of the comprehensive at-sea support as U.S. Navy seaplanes undertook the historic first aerial crossing of the Atlantic. After completing <b>exercises</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Caribbean, she was placed in commission, in reserve at New York on 7 August. She was laid up in reduced commission at Philadelphia and Charleston, South Carolina, {{in the years that}} followed. She was reactivated for training in New England waters during the summer of 1921, but returned to Philadelphia, where she was decommissioned on 26 May 1922.|$|E
5|$|Ordered {{under the}} {{contract}} name Ersatz Heimdall {{as a replacement}} for the obsolete coastal defense ship , Friedrich der Grosse was laid down at the AG Vulcan dockyard in Hamburg on 26 January 1910. She was launched on 10 June 1911, after which AG Vulcan conducted builder's trials. At her launching ceremony, Princess Alexandra Victoria performed the christening and Field Marshal Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz gave a speech. She was then transferred to Wilhelmshaven and commissioned into the fleet on 15 October 1912. <b>Exercises</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Baltic Sea followed; Friedrich der Grosse then went to Kiel for final fitting-out work. On 22 January 1913, the ship was finally ready for active service. She cost the German government 45,802,000marks.|$|E
