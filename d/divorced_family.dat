40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine the {{relationship}} between parental conflict and internalizing problems of adolescents in intact and <b>divorced</b> <b>families.</b> To answer this key question, the following four subquestions were answered: (1) Is there a difference between adolescents from intact families and adolescents from <b>divorced</b> <b>families</b> in mean level of internalizing problems?, (2) What is the relationship between parental conflict and internalizing problems of adolescents?, (3) Is there a difference between mean level of parental conflict in intact <b>families</b> and <b>divorced</b> <b>families?,</b> (4) Do conflicts show a different relationship with internalizing problems of adolescents in intact and <b>divorced</b> <b>families?</b> The sample consisted of 518 Dutch students from the first three classes of secondary education (M = 13. 36 years old, SD = 1. 02, 46. 6 % girls and 53. 4 % boys). 75. 7 % of the adolescents came from intact families and 24. 3 % from <b>divorced</b> <b>families.</b> Data on family structure, parental conflict and adolescent internalizing behavior were collected with self-report questionnaires, which were administered in the classroom. Results showed that adolescents from intact families reported significantly less internalizing problems than adolescents from <b>divorced</b> <b>families.</b> Conflicts between parents were also positively related to internalizing problems of adolescents. It was found that adolescents from <b>divorced</b> <b>families</b> reported significantly higher levels of conflict between parents than adolescents from intact families. It can be concluded that parental conflict is significantly and positively correlated with internalizing problems of adolescents in both intact and <b>divorced</b> <b>families,</b> although this correlation is higher in adolescents from intact families than in adolescents from <b>divorced</b> <b>families.</b> However, this difference was not significant. Given these results, it can be concluded that parental conflicts are related to internalizing behavior of both adolescents from divorced and adolescents from intact families. These findings should guide the development of more effective interventions targeting parental conflict and should make parents aware of the harm their conflicts can do to their adolescents...|$|R

40|$|Background: Previous {{studies have}} shown a linkage between parental divorce and adolescents' delinquent behavior. However, it remains unclear whether adolescents’ {{ethnicity}} and gender are moderating factors in this correlation. Purpose: To examine the differences in delinquent behavior between adolescents from <b>divorced</b> and intact <b>families,</b> {{as well as to}} investigate the role of ethnicity and gender in explaining these differences. Method: Quantitative research has been completed by collecting cross-sequential data in the years 2006 and 2013. These data have been combined and generated a sample of 4177 selectively recruited high school students. The results are based on the students who answered questions about parental divorce and delinquent behavior. Results: Adolescents from <b>divorced</b> <b>families</b> show significantly higher levels of delinquent behavior compared to adolescents from intact families. Furthermore, a significant difference has been found in mean delinquent behavior between adolescents from different ethnic groups. Compared to western adolescents from <b>divorced</b> <b>families,</b> non-western adolescents from <b>divorced</b> <b>families</b> showed significantly higher levels of delinquent behavior. Although boys from intact and <b>divorced</b> <b>families</b> showed higher levels of delinquent behavior compared to girls from intact and <b>divorced</b> <b>families,</b> gender did not play a significant role. Conclusion: Adolescents from <b>divorced</b> <b>families</b> report considerably more frequent delinquent behavior than adolescents from intact families. In the linkage between parental divorce and delinquent behavior ethnicity plays a significant role. Even though results show that boys are more delinquent compared to girls after parental divorce, gender does not {{play a significant role in}} explaining the link between parental divorce and delinquent behavior.

40|$|MSW, North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 <b>Divorce</b> and <b>family</b> {{disruption}} {{are growing}} phenomena {{in the world}} and a reality in many children‟s lives. Almost half of all <b>divorced</b> <b>families</b> in South Africa have {{children under the age of}} 18 years. Divorce is a traumatic experience for children. Adolescent children in particular experience divorce as distressing. Adolescent children need to face numerous challenges while going through the transitional phase between childhood and adulthood. They are in the process of identity formation and rely on their parents‟ support and presence to develop a strong and positive identity. The Military is often described as a selfish entity, which demands members‟ undivided attention and loyalty. When Military families go through a process of divorce, they need to face the trauma of the divorce as well as the specific demands of the organisation. Adolescent children from <b>divorcing</b> <b>families</b> in a Military context experience specific needs, and their parents and the Military as organisation have a definite role to play in fulfilling these needs. This study focused on exploring the needs of adolescent children in <b>divorced</b> <b>families</b> in a South African Military context. A significant amount of research has been done on adolescent children in <b>divorced</b> <b>families,</b> but little is known about the needs of adolescent children in <b>divorced</b> <b>families</b> in a South African Military context. Hence, it is in this particular area that this study endeavours to make a contribution. The research was conducted in three Military bases in the Cape Town metropole area. Nine participants (five females and four males) consented to participate in the study. The size of the sample was not predetermined, but was based on data saturation. Participants were purposefully selected on the basis of the following: they are adolescents between the ages of 11 and 18 years, they have parents whose divorce process has been finalised, and one or both of their parents are employed by the Military. Data was collected through conducting semi-structured one-on-one interviews with all participants. A semi-structured interview schedule assisted the researcher to facilitate the interviews for consistency. The researcher was able to validate data and elaborate on certain issues during interviews. Data was analysed through thematic analysis and different themes and sub-themes were defined. The researcher ensured the trustworthiness of the research process by following the guidelines as suggested by Lincoln and Guba (1985). The study found that adolescent children in <b>divorced</b> <b>families</b> in a South African Military context have specific needs and that their focal need was for emotional support. They need their parents to communicate openly with them regarding the divorce process as well as the reasons for the divorce. Adolescents in Military <b>divorced</b> <b>families</b> long for a good relationship between them and their parents. They need to feel loved and want their parents physically and emotionally present in their lives. Participants need from the Military and schools to offer therapeutic support services as well as group sessions for adolescent children in Military <b>divorced</b> <b>families.</b> Although their basic psychological needs were met by the residing parent, they need to know that the newly formed single-parent family of which they now form part will be able to survive financially. Some researchers found that adolescent children from <b>divorced</b> <b>families</b> tended to reject faith. However, participants in this study indicated that they strongly needed support from their spiritual organisations and youth movements. In order to meet the needs of adolescent children in <b>divorced</b> <b>families</b> in the South African Military context, parents need to stay involved in their children‟s lives and communicate in an open and honest way with them. Military social workers, psychologists and chaplains need to ensure that therapeutic services are available to adolescent children of divorcing parents and that the adolescents attend these sessions. Work-related Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) could be put in place to ensure that all adolescent children from <b>divorcing</b> <b>families</b> attend therapeutic sessions. Group sessions should be available and accessible for adolescent children in <b>divorcing</b> Military <b>families.</b> Master...|$|R
40|$|Background: This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the differences in internalizing and externalizing behavior among adolescents from <b>divorced</b> and intact <b>families</b> in the Netherlands and the possible changes in these differences compared to a decade ago. More specifically, the comparison consists of differences in anxiety, depression, delinquency, and aggression. Moreover, these differences between adolescents from intact and <b>divorced</b> <b>families</b> will be compared to differences in an earlier wave of the study, ten years ago. Method: To answer the research questions, data has been collected in 2006 (N = 1659) and 2016 (N = 518) from students of high schools {{all over the country}} (Students and Families). Results: There appears to be a significant difference between mean level of internalizing behavior among adolescents from <b>divorced</b> and intact <b>families.</b> Adolescents from <b>divorced</b> <b>families</b> appear to experience significantly more anxiety and depression than their peers from intact families. No significant difference appears between externalizing behavior among adolescents from <b>divorced</b> and intact <b>families.</b> A significant interaction of family structure and wave for internalizing behavior has been found. Compared with the data from 2006, internalizing behavior has increased among adolescents from both <b>divorced</b> <b>families</b> and intact families. There also appears to be a significant interaction of family structure and wave for delinquency, but not for aggression. Externalizing behavior decreased among adolescents from <b>divorced</b> <b>families</b> and intact families as well, compared with the data from 2006. Discussion: The pointedly findings of this research are the increase of internalizing and decrease of externalizing behavior between 2006 and 2016. The differences between intact and <b>divorced</b> <b>families</b> became bigger for internalizing, but smaller for externalizing behavior. Since this was the first study to date on this theme, we recommend replication of these findings in a larger sample. Further, possible explanations for this result are suggested to be found among experts in the field.

40|$|Executive {{functions}} are {{a group of}} neurocognitive functions that direct cognitive, emotional and social behaviour, to enable an adequate reply to a new situation. The rapid development of executive functions in pre-schoolers (three to five year olds) assume a certain vulnerability to influences from the environment. The goal {{of this study is}} to investigate the influence of social economic status (SES), family structure and child day-care on executive functioning of four- and five-year old children. Parents or caretakers filled in two questionnaires about their own children: one was about demographic features, the other was the standard BRIEF-Preschool Version. Analyses were performed on a sample of 497 four- and five year olds. As we hypothesised, a negative effect was visible of low SES and a <b>divorced</b> <b>family</b> structure on executive functioning. Child day-care seemed to compensate for children whose parents are divorced. Moreover, for children who lived in a family structure where one biological parent found a new partner, day-care seemed to have a further negative effect on executive functioning. Furthermore, this study confirmed the unidimensional, general model for executive functioning for pre-schoolers previously proposed by Wiebe and colleagues (2008) and Wagner-Fuhs & Days (2010). Although the effects were small and the study sample was not statistically representative for the Dutch population, we were able to replicate results from previous research.

40|$|Background: Children of <b>divorced</b> <b>families</b> {{report more}} {{internalizing and externalizing}} problem {{behavior}} compared to children of continuously married parents. Research shows that a possible cause for this increased problem behavior, which can be reduced by protective factors, may be the stress that accompanies and a parental divorce. This study focuses on potential protective factors in the family environment of children from <b>divorced</b> <b>families.</b> Specifically having siblings, {{the quality of the}} sibling relationship and owning a pet are expected to reduce possible problem behavior. Method: A subsample of a cross-sequential dataset was taken consisting of 1432 children from <b>divorced</b> <b>families.</b> The protective effects of siblings, sibling relationships, and pets were examined using dummy variables via mostly regression analyses. The independent variables were both internalizing and externalizing problem behavior. Results: The quality of the sibling relationship significantly predicted less externalizing problem behavior in children from <b>divorced</b> <b>families,</b> compared to children from intact families. No protective effect of the quality of sibling relationships for internalizing problem behavior was found in this study. Solely having a sibling did not significantly predict the reduction of either type of problem behavior. Also a non-significant relationship between owning a pet and problem behavior was found. However, the relationship between having pets and problem behavior showed an almost significant effect, hinting at a protective effect of pets on externalizing problem behavior in children of divorce. Conclusion: In this study we found some protective factors for children of <b>divorced</b> <b>families</b> are present in the family environment. These protective factors {{can be found in a}} sibling relationship and presumably in pets.
