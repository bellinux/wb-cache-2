50|$|A clutch damper is {{a device}} that softens the {{response}} of the clutch engagement/disengagement. In automotive applications, this is often provided by a mechanism in the clutch disc centres. In addition to the <b>damped</b> <b>disc</b> centres, which reduce driveline vibration, pre-dampers may be used to reduce gear rattle at idle by changing the natural frequency of the disc. These weaker springs are compressed solely by the radial vibrations of an idling engine. They are fully compressed and no longer in use once the main damper springs take up drive.|$|R

40|$|In this project, {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate the effect of magnetic <b>damping</b> on rotating <b>discs.</b> A freely rotating disc made from a magnetic conducting material would eventually come to a rest on its own, owing to natural damping factors such as friction and air resistance. However, {{under the influence of}} a magnetic field, we expect the damping behavior to deviate from normal conditions as this spinning disc, would now be cutting various lines of flux that originate due to the present magnetic fields generated by a present electromagnet. Thus it is the purpose of this project to experimentally determine what orientation of applied electromagnets and hence of magnetic fields would produce the most significant damping effect. The <b>damping</b> of such <b>discs</b> by magnetic means can be very useful in applications such as braking in large vehicles such as trains and roller-coasters. Since magnetic braking is contact-less it produces no wear and tear as compared to friction driven braking and requires less maintenance It is concluded from this project that the use of a magnetic field is indeed feasible in order to damp the rotation of a spinning disc and certain orientations are more effective than others in achieving this result. Recommendations for improvement of the experimental process have also been suggested in the form of testing the theory at higher rotation speeds. i...|$|R
40|$|Thc {{magnitude}} of mechanical vibration and noise generated within machinery depends on damping. However, little is understood about how damping is distributed {{among the various}} possible damping sources. The results given in this papcr isolate and quantify lubrication film <b>damping</b> between rolling <b>discs</b> and show that damping within the lubrication film contributes significantly to the total damping. A comparison of laboratoiy nicasurcniciits with computer calculations shows that lubrication film damping is grcatest under conditions of contact separation and thus indicates that fluid film damping is generated primarily by the squeeze film mechanism. 1 1 NTRODUCTION 'The {{magnitude of}} mechanical vibration and noise generated within machinery depends on damping.

40|$|Although a {{brake pad}} and disc have many modes of vibration, {{when it is}} {{unstable}} and hence noisy then frequently only a single mode of the complete system contributes to the vibration. In this condition, only a few modes are required to model the system. In this paper, a two-degree-of-freedom model is adopted where the disc and the pad are modelled as single modes connected by a sliding friction interface. Using this model, {{the interaction between the}} pad and the disc is investigated. Stability analysis is performed to show under what parametric conditions the system becomes unstable, assuming that the existence of a limit cycle represents the noisy state of the disc brake system. The results of this analysis show that the <b>damping</b> of the <b>disc</b> is as important as that of the pad. Non-linear analysis is also performed to demonstrate various limit cycles in the phase space.

40|$|The {{parametric}} resonances {{that occur}} in a stationary annular disc under the action of a distributed mass–spring–damper system which rotates, with friction, around the disc at subcritical speeds is {{the main focus of}} this paper. The distributed system occupies an annular sector and the stiffness, mass, damping and friction are each expanded in a Fourier series. When the distributed system is rotated then a set of stiffness, mass, damping and friction terms are obtained that vary both spatially and temporally. Finite element discretization is applied to the disc and the distributed system and the parametric resonances are determined by a multiple time–scales analysis of the finite element equations. The equations that define the transition curves are generally complex, although they are strictly real when damping and friction are omitted. Numerical results show that friction has a destabilizing effect over the entire subcritical speed range. <b>Disc</b> <b>damping</b> and damping in the rotating system both tend to suppress the vibrations of the disc when the speeds are subcritical.

40|$|The {{in-plane}} vibration of a slider-mass {{which is}} driven around {{the surface of}} a flexible disc, and the transverse vibration of the disc, are investigated. The disc is taken to be an elastic annular plate and the slider has flexibility and damping in the circumferential (in-plane) and transverse directions. The static friction coefficient is assumed to be higher than the dynamic friction. As a result of the friction force acting between the disc and the slider system, the slider will oscillate in the stick-slip mode in the plane of the disc. The transverse vibration induced by the slider will change the normal force on the disc, which in turn will change the in-plane oscillation of the slider. A numerical method is used to solve the two coupled equations of the motion. Results indicate that normal pressure and rotating speed can drive the system into instability. The rigidity and <b>damping</b> of the <b>disc</b> and transverse stiffness and damping of the slider tend to suppress the vibrations. The in-plane stiffness and damping of the slider do not always have a stabilizing effect.

40|$|At the Iggesund mill {{there are}} several methods and {{equipments}} in laboratory scale that simulate the offset printing process in order to evaluate mottle tendency or ink tack for instance. However, {{it is not possible}} to study the effect of pre-damping prior to printing on these properties, which mostly is the case in industrial printing. The purpose of this work was therefore to develop a method for pre-damp application used prior to laboratory offset printing in order to learn more about the ink/fountain solution/substrate interaction. This method was used to study the effect of pre-damp on ink tack measurements and on water interference mottle tendency in laboratory scale. The initial trials were focused on ink tack measurements without pre-damp in order to achieve knowledge about this type of measurement. The effect of different parameters used within the ink tack measurements was also investigated. The ink tack measurements were rather sensitive to the method of ink distribution procedure, the positioning of the tack disc and the fastening of the paperboard sample. Additionally, the printing speed, the printing pressure and the hold time affected the measurements. However, measurements in the cross direction and the machine direction of the paperboard were compared, and did not show a significant difference. Different levels of tackiness of the ink were also tested. For instance, an ink that previously had caused delamination failure in industrial offset printing showed a relatively high ink tack. Four different paperboard qualities were also compared. The small differences in ink tack between the samples were explained by the differences in coating characteristic resulting in different ink absorption. The same paperboard qualities were also used in an inter-comparison between different laboratories measuring ink tack (Iggesund, STFI and Imerys). The same machine settings and the same type of ink was used in the investigation. Although the four qualities always were ranged in the same order, both the level and the shape of the ink tack curve differed in between the three laboratories. One explanation given was that different tack discs were used in the investigation. The method developed for pre-damp application was based on condensation of a water film on a cooled down metal disc. The effect of the temperature on the metal disc surface (inside a fridge), the dwell time inside a desiccator and the time for condensation in a conditioned room on the amount of water developed on the disc surface was investigated. The amount of water developed and transferred could be related to the resulting print density or transferred ink amount. A lower print density or transferred ink amount implied a larger amount of water applied to the sample. The experiments showed that this procedure is rather uncertain and that the tests are difficult to reproduce. However, a lower temperature of the <b>damp</b> <b>disc</b> inside the fridge in general resulted in a larger amount of water developed onto the disc surface. The pre-damp application was used prior to printing and ink tack measurements. The maximum and the shape of the ink tack curve only changed slightly when using pre-damp in comparison to the measurements without pre- damp. In general, the ink tack curve in the later phase was lowered when using pre-damp, indicating a faster ink setting and drying. This may be attributed to that the viscosity of the ink decreases when blended with water. Another explanation given was that penetration of water into the substrate leads to swelling and consequently a rougher surface and a lower ink tack. A lower amount of ink transferred in some cases may be another explanation. The pre-damp was also applied prior to printing in Prüfbau in mottle evaluations, creating water interference mottle. Two paperboard samples with different levels of performance in industrial printing were compared. The sample with less good performance also appeared worse in this investigation with respect to mottle, both with and without pre-damp before printing. This sample had lower coat weight according to burn out pictures and also a lower contact angle in comparison to the better sample. A correlation was also achieved between the water interference mottle tendency obtained in laboratory printing and in a full scale printing trial, respectively. Only three qualities were included in this investigation. Further experiments must be performed to really see the correlation between these two methods. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|Accretion discs {{are present}} around both stellar-mass black holes in X-ray {{binaries}} and supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei. A {{wide variety of}} circumstantial evidence implies {{that many of these}} discs are warped. The standard Bardeen [...] Petterson model attributes the shape of the warp to the competition between Lense [...] Thirring torque from the central black hole and viscous angular-momentum transport within the disc. We show that this description is incomplete, and that torques from the companion star (for X-ray binaries) or the self-gravity of the disc (for active galactic nuclei) can {{play a major role in}} determining the properties of the warped disc. Including these effects leads to a rich set of new phenomena. For example, (i) when a companion star is present and the warp arises from a misalignment between the companion's orbital axis and the black hole's spin axis, there is no steady-state solution of the Pringle [...] Ogilvie equations for a thin warped disc when the viscosity falls below a critical value; (ii) in AGN accretion discs, the warp can excite short-wavelength bending waves that propagate inward with growing amplitude until they are <b>damped</b> by the <b>disc</b> viscosity. We show that both phenomena can occur for plausible values of the black hole and disc parameters, and briefly discuss their observational implications. Comment: 28 pages, 11 figure...|$|R
40|$|With {{an average}} {{eccentricity}} of about 0. 29, the eccentricity distribution of extrasolar planets is markedly {{different from the}} solar system. Among other scenarios considered, it has been proposed that eccentricity may grow through planet-disc interaction. Recently, it has been noticed that the thermodynamical state of the disc can significantly influence the migration properties of growing protoplanets. However, the evolution of planetary eccentricity in radiative discs has not been considered yet. In this paper we study the evolution of planets on eccentric orbits that are embedded in a three-dimensional viscous disc and analyse the disc's effect on the orbital evolution of the planet. We use the three-dimensional hydrodynamical code NIRVANA that includes full tensor viscosity and implicit radiation transport in the flux-limited diffusion approximation. The code uses the FARGO-algorithm {{to speed up the}} simulations. First we measure the torque and power exerted on the planet by the disc for fixed orbits, and then we let the planet start with initial eccentricity and evolve it in the disc. For locally isothermal we confirm previous results and find eccentricity damping and inward migration for planetary cores. In the case of radiative discs, the planets experience an inward migration as long as its eccentricity lies above a certain threshold. After the damping of eccentricity cores with masses below 33 Earthmasses begin to migrate outward in radiative discs, while higher mass cores always migrate inward. For all planetary masses studied (up to 200 Earthmasses) we find eccentricity <b>damping.</b> In viscous <b>discs</b> the orbital eccentricity of embedded planets is damped during the evolution independent of the mass. Hence, planet-disc interaction {{does not seem to be}} a viable mechanism to explain the observed high eccentricity of exoplanets. Comment: 18 pages, Astronomy&Astrophysics, in pres...|$|R
