25|$|Elderspeak is a {{specialized}} speech style used by younger adults when addressing older adults. The speaker makes accommodations that include producing shorter, less complex sentences, using simpler vocabulary, <b>filler</b> <b>words,</b> fragmented sentences, lexical filters, and repetition. Elderspeak also includes using {{terms that are}} overly endearing, asking closed questions that prompt an answer, and using the collective “we”. Young people tend to speak at a slower rate and include more pauses when communicating with elders. This speech style is often patronizing in nature and resembles baby talk. Elderspeak stems from a reliance on stereotypes about cognitive abilities of older persons, and its use may {{be a result of}} or contribute to ageism, a form of discrimination based on age differences. Young people tend to believe that aging is associated with cognitive declines, including declines in language processing and production. However, this speech pattern is primarily based on stereotypes, as evidenced by its use in situations where older adults are clearly functioning well. When conversing with older persons, younger people often accommodate their speech based on their personal evaluation of their conversation partner’s ability, rather than their actual ability. Working to overcome elderspeak through awareness and self-monitoring as well as through formal educational programs are strategies individuals and other care providers can use to promote successful aging for older clients. Therefore, although some aspects of elderspeak may be beneficial for some recipients, it is generally seen as inappropriate and can hinder intergenerational communication.|$|E

5000|$|The auction chant is a {{repetition}} of two numbers at a time which indicate the monetary amount involved with the sale of an item. The first number {{is the amount of}} money which is currently being offered by a bidder for a given item. The second number is what the next bid needs to be in order to become the [...] "high bidder" [...] or simply [...] "the current man on". In between the numbers are [...] "filler words" [...] which are what the auctioneer says to tie the chant together making it smooth and rhythmic. <b>Filler</b> <b>words</b> serve as a thinking point for both the auctioneer and the bidders. <b>Filler</b> <b>words</b> can serve to make a statement, ask questions, or can simply serve as a means of adding rhythm to the chant (which all <b>filler</b> <b>words</b> should do regardless). Typical <b>filler</b> <b>words,</b> which are taught at schools of auctioneering, are [...] "dollar bid", [...] "now", and [...] "will ya' give me?". The typically taught chant for beginning auctioneers follows the pattern: [...] "One dollar bid, now two, now two, will ya' give me two? Two dollar bid, now three, now three, will ya' give me three?", and continues in this fashion until the crowd stops bidding and the item is sold to the high bidder (auto auctions have [...] "reserves" [...] or [...] "minimum price" [...] placed on all autos, so if the high bidder doesn't meet the reserve, they may be asked to raise their own bid in order to successfully purchase the vehicle in question). Often prior to [...] "closing the bidding" [...] & selling an item, auctioneers will announce: [...] "Going once, going twice, sold!" [...] or [...] "Going, going, gone!", followed by announcing the winning bid. Often auctioneers will stand at a lectern with a gavel, which they use to bang the lectern to end bidding on an item prior to announcing the winning bid. Slurring <b>filler</b> <b>words</b> to make multi-part filler word phrases is a key element, giving the illusion that the auctioneer is talking fast, and thus creating more excitement and bidding anxiety among the bidding crowd.|$|E

[...] "Like" [...] {{is used as}} a <b>filler</b> <b>word,</b> similar to [...] "um" [...] or [...] "er," [...] as in, [...] "I'm, like, about to call my friend."

5000|$|For instance, {{the passage}} 室那室那 阿囉嘇佛囉舍利 (Siddhaṃ text of T. 1113b: cinda 2 arṣam pracali), {{is thought to}} be a {{corruption}} of kṛṣṇa-sarpopavīta [...] "thou with the black serpent as the sacred thread" [...] (attested in other versions and hinted in Amoghavajra's commentary in T. 1111), with the word for 'serpent' (सर्प sarpa) as written in Siddhaṃ script being misread as 2arsa. Meanwhile, 薩婆菩哆那摩縛伽摩罰特豆 (T. 1113b: sarva-bhutanama vagama vadudu) is a misrendering of sarva-bhūtānām bhava-mārga visodhakam ("(it) cleanses the path of existence of all beings"), with dudu (特豆) being a <b>filler</b> <b>word</b> to cover a portion of the text that was not perceived clearly.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} sought to {{investigate}} the use of prediction during sentence comprehension and whether prediction could lead to false memories for sentences when the ending of a sentence is not properly recovered. Participants listened to sentences (e. g. “The boy will eat the cake”) whilst looking at supporting visual scenes. Sentences either contained a constraining verb that could refer to only one object in the scene (e. g. “eat”) or a non-constraining verb that could apply to any object in the scene (e. g. “move”). Some sentences contained a <b>filler</b> <b>word</b> (“thingy” or “something”) instead of the final noun of the sentence. Participants were presented with a memory test after listening to a block of sentences and had to respond whether a visually presented sentence had previously been heard or not. Critical sentences had the <b>filler</b> <b>word</b> replaced with the correct noun to test for false recognition of sentences with predicted words. Results showed that participants looked towards a target object before hearing its name significantly more and earlier when the sentence heard contained a constraining verb than when the sentence contained a non-constraining verb. Greater looks towards distractor objects in the scene {{were found in the}} non-constraining verb condition than the constraining verb condition. In the memory tests, participants were significantly worse at rejecting critical sentences than rejecting new sentences or accepting sentences previously heard. However, {{there was no significant difference}} between performance on critical trials in which participants had engaged in predictive eye-movements and critical trials in which participants had not engaged in predictive eye-movements. Results provide further support for prediction during online sentence comprehension but the nature of the representation of the predicted item and the consequences of an incorrect or unresolved prediction remains an open question...|$|R

40|$|Both {{human and}} {{automatic}} processing of speech require recognizing {{more than just}} the words. We describe a state-of-the-art system for automatic detection of “metadata ” (information beyond the words) in both broadcast news and spontaneous telephone conversations, developed as part of the DARPA EARS Rich Transcription program. System tasks include sentence boundary detection, <b>filler</b> <b>word</b> detection, and detection/correction of disfluencies. To achieve best performance, we combine information from different types of language models (based on words, part-of-speech classes, and automatically induced classes) with information from a prosodic classifier. The prosodic classifier employs bagging and ensemble approaches to better estimate posterior probabilities. We use confusion networks to improve robustness to speech recognition errors. Most recently, we have investigated a maximum entropy approach for the sentence boundary detection task, yielding a gain over our standard HMM approach. We report results for these techniques on the official NIST Rich Transcription metadata tasks. 1...|$|R

50|$|While each {{prosodic}} unit {{may carry}} a large information load in rehearsed speech, in extemporaneous conversation {{the amount of}} information is much more limited. There is seldom more than a single lexical noun in any one IU, and it is uncommon to have both a lexical noun and a lexical verb in the same IU. Indeed, many IUs are semantically empty, taken up by <b>filler</b> <b>words</b> such as um, well, or y'know. Chafe (1994) believes that this reflects the constraints of information processing by the brain during speech production, with chunks of speech (IUs) corresponding to chunks of cognitive output. It is also a possibility that the distribution of information across IUs is designed to maximize language comprehension by the other party.|$|E
