5|$|By {{the time}} Mobile was {{included}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> Territory in 1813, the population had dwindled to roughly 300 people.

5|$|Other {{analysis}} {{suggested that}} in fleet actions, only broadsides were effective, thus maximizing {{the number of}} centerline guns was the most efficient approach.

5|$|She {{was placed}} in reserve {{after the end of}} the war and sold in 1874. Her new owners {{converted}} Chickasaw into a train ferry in 1881 and renamed her Gouldsboro. The ship was later converted into a barge and remained in use until she sank sometime during the 1950s. Her wreck was discovered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River in New Orleans in 2003, although there are no plans to raise her.|$|E
5|$|The Mississippi Health Project brought primary {{medical care}} to the rural Black {{population}} across the state for six summers.

5|$|Fungal {{pneumonia}} is uncommon, but occurs {{more commonly}} in individuals with weakened immune systems due to AIDS, immunosuppressive drugs, or other medical problems. It {{is most often}} caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, blastomyces, Cryptococcus neoformans, Pneumocystis jiroveci (pneumocystis pneumonia), and Coccidioides immitis. Histoplasmosis is most common <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River basin, and coccidioidomycosis is most common in the Southwestern United States. The number of cases has been increasing in the later half of the 20th century due to increasing travel and rates of immunosuppression in the population.|$|E
50|$|The five school districts, {{other than}} the Cleveland School District, are among the 20 {{smallest}} of the 152 school districts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> State of <b>Mississippi.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> State of <b>Mississippi,</b> Bolivar County was the only county that had six school districts. Consolidation was urged to save money and facilitate cooperation. <b>In</b> 2012 <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> Senate Education Committee passed a bill asking <b>the</b> State of <b>Mississippi</b> to consolidate <b>the</b> six school districts in Bolivar County to three or two. <b>The</b> <b>Mississippi</b> Senate passed <b>the</b> bill 37-11.|$|R

5|$|In 1861, Loring joined Fletcher in L. Fletcher & Co., {{a general}} store specializing in {{supplies}} for lumbermen on Nicollet Avenue across from Minneapolis City Hall where they prospered for fifteen years. They joined with W. F. Cahill {{to convert the}} municipal waterworks building into a flour mill run on hydropower, the smallest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> west bank milling district. With George Hineline they added three limestone stories and operated it as the W. F. Cahill & Co. Holly mill. During this period, Loring served in the city government, first as road supervisor and in 1872 as a Minneapolis City Council member from the Fifth Ward in the Near North community.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} session of the 33rd Congress, Breckinridge acted as {{spokesman}} for Ways and Means Committee bills, including a bill to assume and pay the debts Texas incurred prior to its annexation. Breckinridge's friends, W. W. Corcoran and Jesse D. Bright, were two of Texas's major creditors. The bill, which was approved, paid only those debts related to powers Texas surrendered to Congress upon annexation. Breckinridge was disappointed that the House defeated a measure to pay the Sioux $12,000 owed them for the 1839 purchase of an island <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River; the debt was never paid. Another increase in the subsidy to the Collins Line passed over his opposition, but Pierce vetoed it.|$|E
5|$|Shiloh was the costliest {{battle in}} American history {{to that point}} and the {{staggering}} 23,746 total casualties stunned the nation. Briefly hailed a hero for routing the Confederates, Grant was soon mired in controversy. The Northern press castigated Grant for shockingly high casualties, and accused him of drunkenness during the battle, contrary to the accounts of officers and others {{with him at the}} time. However, Grant's victory at Shiloh ended any chance for the Confederates to prevail <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> valley or regain its strategic advantage in the West.|$|E

5|$|The Benjamin G. Humphreys Bridge, {{the first}} bridge {{to connect the}} two towns, had become {{functionally}} obsolete. Its narrow road had only two lanes with no shoulders. Because of its location near a sharp bend <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River, the bridge had become a hazard to river traffic; barges and towboats frequently collided with it. In 1994, a study concluded that a new bridge was needed and the old one should be torn down. Construction was begun in 2001 and the new bridge opened in 2010. In 2011, the process of removing the old bridge began.|$|E
5|$|The Early Woodland period saw the {{introduction}} of ceramics to Iowa, including Marion Thick and Black Sand types. Marion Thick may have originated with the nucleated Late Archaic cultures of the Upper Midwest, and was widespread in distribution. Early Woodland Indians in eastern Iowa built large burial mounds <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River region, and participated in long-distance trade of exotic raw material. This long-distance trade {{may have been the}} forerunner of the later Havanna-Hopewell trading sphere. In north-central Iowa, Early Woodland peoples appear to have interacted more directly with the Prairie Lakes region of Minnesota. Numerous Early Woodland sites have been excavated in Iowa, including the Gast Spring Site, and many sites which have not been formally published.|$|E

5|$|The {{city has}} a Department of Homeland Security (DHS), {{becoming}} the only local DHS in the state. The team oversees an area of nine counties. Upon receiving $2.5 million in grants from the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency and other organizations, the department began training law enforcement offices from other Southern states in passenger rail rescue as well as offering civilian classes in basic handguns, Boy Scout first aid and hunting, and firearms training. The DHS helps during times of crisis such as Hurricane Ivan in September 2004, when the department helped establish and support shelters for 700 evacuees. The city now serves {{as the leader of}} one of the task forces <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> DHS, a combination of three nine-county teams.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{has been}} prone to flooding, due to it being <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River's vicinity. The floods have {{impacted}} the Eagle Bend area, {{one of the}} communities on MS 465. In May 2011, the highway was closed in preparation for floods, which were already impacting the region. It re-opened in June, after repairs and cleanups were done to the road. MS 465 was closed again in early January 2016, as waters approached flood levels again. People were told to evacuate Eagle Lake via the northern section of MS 465. After waters receded {{by the end of}} January, the highway was re-opened to the public.|$|E
5|$|Wake lows form due to {{adiabatic}} warming {{in the wake}} of mature squall lines at the back edge of their rain shields, where evaporative cooling is unable to offset warming due to atmospheric subsidence, or downward motion. They can be caused by gravity waves which duct through boundary layers which are deep and cold to the north of a weather front. As with mesoscale high-pressure areas behind a squall line, when new thunderstorm development stops along the squall line, the wake low will weaken as well. Clearing conditions will accompany the wake low, due to the descending warm air mass associated with the feature. Within the United States, these systems have been observed to form <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> river valley, Southeast, Florida, and Great Plains.|$|E
