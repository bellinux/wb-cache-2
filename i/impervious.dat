5|$|As {{part of the}} {{clean-up}} it {{was proposed}} to line the two disused graving docks with an <b>impervious</b> synthetic membrane and fill them with the contaminated soil.|$|E
5|$|An {{embankment}} dam {{is a massive}} artificial water barrier. It is typically created by the emplacement and compaction of a complex semi-plastic mound of various compositions of soil, sand, clay and/or rock. It has a semi-permanent natural waterproof covering for its surface, and a dense, waterproof core. This makes such a dam <b>impervious</b> to surface or seepage erosion.|$|E
5|$|Iron {{is by far}} {{the most}} {{reactive}} element in its group; it is pyrophoric when finely divided and dissolves easily in dilute acids, giving Fe2+. However, it does not react with concentrated nitric acid and other oxidizing acids due to the formation of an <b>impervious</b> oxide layer, which can nevertheless react with hydrochloric acid.|$|E
5|$|While {{historically}} pure, {{the stream}} now suffers from urban stream syndrome, partially {{due to the}} amount of <b>impervious</b> surfaces within its watershed. Flowing over glacial till, the stream's bed is rich in cobbles and the kill supports populations of benthic macroinvertebrates, trees, shrubs, fish, birds, snapping turtles, and frogs. As of 2016, a Vassar–Cornell University program is monitoring the water quality of the Fonteyn Kill.|$|E
5|$|Historically, most rain {{falling on}} the {{watershed}} was taken up by vegetation, flowed into wetlands, soaked into the ground, or evaporated. Heavy rain in the winter months recharged the groundwater and provided baseflows to the slough during dry summers. Urban development, which replaced vegetation and water-absorbing soils with airport runways, house roofs, highways, warehouses, parking lots, and other hard surfaces, interrupted this cycle. In 1999, a study estimated that <b>impervious</b> surfaces covered 54percent of the watershed. Storm runoff that might have taken days to reach the historic slough reaches the developed slough in hours.|$|E
5|$|Riprap {{was laid}} on the {{upstream}} face of the dam beginning November 9 of that year. In 1962, a series of labor strikes impacted communities in the Central Valley, also affecting construction of the dam, which was temporarily halted on May 3 of that year. After work restarted on June 26, pervious core material for the dam was soon out of supply, so <b>impervious</b> material was used to complete the dam core.|$|E
5|$|The {{report also}} noted {{concerns}} about the District's conclusion that the water withdrawals will have few deleterious ecological effects. This conclusion {{was based on the}} model findings that increased flows from upper basin projects and from changes in land use (increases in <b>impervious</b> areas) largely compensated for the impacts of water withdrawals on water flows and levels. Although the upper basin projects are positive insofar as they will return land to the basin (and water to the river), the same cannot be said about increased urban runoff, the poor quality of which is well known.|$|E
5|$|Eolambia {{would have}} lived in a forested {{environment}} {{at the edge of}} lakes in a humid floodplain environment, feeding on gymnosperms, ferns, and flowering plants. The water levels in the lakes changed over time with cyclical wet and dry spells caused by the precession of the Earth, reflected by alternating bands in the sediments of the Mussentuchit Member. As a juvenile, Eolambia would have been preyed upon by large crocodylomorphs residing in the lake waters. With increasing age, however, they became <b>impervious</b> to the crocodylomorphs, and mature individuals (at least eight to nine years in age) were preyed on by large theropods such as the neovenatorid Siats.|$|E
5|$|Examination of {{the radar}} array also allowed British {{scientists}} {{to conclude that}} they would have to deploy a countermeasure that had recently been developed, code-named Window. Examination of the Würzburg array showed that it was <b>impervious</b> to being jammed by conventional means used by the British during the early years of the conflict; thus Window would have to be deployed against German radars. The effectiveness of Window against Würzburg radar arrays was confirmed by a raid conducted by RAF Bomber Command on 24 July 1943 against Hamburg (Operation Gomorrah); when the bombers utilised Window, all of the radar arrays in Hamburg were blinded and their operators confused, unable to distinguish between the radar signature of a real bomber and several pieces of Window giving off a similar signature.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, {{working under}} {{commission}} from the Farnese family, Titian {{would not have}} sought to portray the sitters in an obviously unsympathetic manner. While Paul is shown as old and frail, he is given a broad chest and cunning eyes that indicate his intelligence and guile. Ottavio is presented as cold and <b>impervious,</b> but this was probably a device to show his strength of character and conviction. Alessandro is favoured by his positioning closest to the Pope, yet x-ray analysis reveals he had originally stood {{to the left of}} the pope and was moved, probably on request by Alessandro himself, to a position where his hand was resting on the papal throne, indicating his claim on the papacy.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon {{is shown}} to be {{as he would have}} been high up in the mountains, as a mortal and imperilled man. While this seems in some way demeaning to Napoleon's figure (and {{contrasts}} in the extreme with David's version, which shows Napoleon <b>impervious</b> to the cold, and in a heroic light), Delaroche's artwork was not intended to portray him in a hostile or unbecoming way. Delaroche wanted to depict Napoleon as a credible man, who suffered and underwent human hardship too, on his most daring exploits, and felt that making him appear as he really {{would have been in the}} situation would by no means debase or diminish Napoleon's iconic status or legacy, but rather make him a more admirable person.|$|E
5|$|President Sukarno proclaimed Indonesia's {{independence}} on 17 August 1945, {{days after}} the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Expecting the Dutch colonial government to return, Djajakusuma and Ismail helped establish the Independent Artists (Seniman Merdeka) {{as a form of}} resistance. The group travelled throughout the city, spreading news of Indonesia's proclaimed independence while performing from an open-air truck. After the arrival of the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration, the group sometimes attempted to spy on the Europeans or hide information which would be considered useful to the returning Dutch forces. Owing to this dangerous work, Djajakusuma began carrying a pistol, and went to Banten to ask a kyai to make him <b>impervious</b> to bullets.|$|E
5|$|The Sulphur Creek {{watershed}} {{has had a}} {{long history}} of water pollution, which can be attributed to residential development. While no raw sewage flows into the creek, the creek is contaminated by large quantities of urban runoff from <b>impervious</b> paved surfaces that collects toxins before pouring untreated into the creek. There are over four large storm drain outlets that pour directly into Sulphur Creek. Such untreated runoff has caused E. coli and Enterovirus to increasingly harm the creek and its remaining biodiversity. Channelization is also another factor, and standing water in the Sulphur Creek Reservoir has suffered eutrophication. The primary source of bacteria contamination is the largest tributary of Sulphur Creek, now mostly underground. The channel joins the creek not too far from its mouth. It has been proved that 87 percent of the Sulphur Creek mainstem is severely degraded.|$|E
5|$|The raw wound {{fabric of}} silk or cotton was fed from large rollers into Myers' {{varnishing}} machine for processing. The processed wet fabric, soaked with varnish, was rubbed and pressed so the varnish {{would go into}} all the pores. The excess varnish was then removed and the wet fabric cloth hung outdoors in bright sunshine for 6 to 12 hours like laundry. The processed fabric had the elastic properties of rubber. This patented varnish that Myers invented was able to seal the balloon material to hold the hydrogen gas, that otherwise would penetrate even glass and metal. The silk or cloth fabric used required eight to ten applications of the varnish to seal properly to be thoroughly <b>impervious</b> to hydrogen gas.|$|E
5|$|The {{superclass}} Tetrapoda {{is divided}} into four classes of vertebrate animals with four limbs. Reptiles, birds and mammals are amniotes, the eggs of which are either laid or carried by the female and are surrounded by several membranes, {{some of which are}} <b>impervious.</b> Lacking these membranes, amphibians require water bodies for reproduction, although some species have developed various strategies for protecting or bypassing the vulnerable aquatic larval stage. They are not found in the sea {{with the exception of one}} or two frogs that live in brackish water in mangrove swamps. On land, amphibians are restricted to moist habitats because of the need to keep their skin damp.|$|E
5|$|As in England, {{commissions}} of new statuary {{tended to}} be made in relatively cheap lead and even more economical painted or gilded plaster. The plasterwork of John Cheere's yard in London was particularly in demand. Also important was the work from the yard of John Bacon (1740–99) who produced a monument for Robert Dundas (d. 1787) at Borthwick Church and one for Mrs Allardyce (d. 1787) at West Church, Aberdeen. Bacon was also a partner in Mrs Eleanor Coade's Artificial Stone Manufactory at Lambeth in London. This produced a buff coloured ceramic that could be moulded to provide fine detail, and be fired in sections, but was <b>impervious</b> to frost and fire. Much cheaper than carved stone, Coade stone was used for sphinxes, balustrading, capitals, coat of arms, tablets, ornamental vases, church monuments and fonts. It was used extensively by the Adam brothers, particularly in the houses they built in Scotland, such as Cullen, Banff, Culzean Castle, Ayrshire, Dunbar Castle, East Lothian, Register House, Edinburgh, Gosford House, East Lothian and Wedderburn, Berwickshire. As well as supplying sculpture, candelabra and cippi, the Adam family supplied designs to the Carron Company, founded in 1759, which produced a wide range of iron products, including stoves, safes, vases and tablets.|$|E
5|$|Construction of Route 25 east of Wareham, however, {{was delayed}} {{for nearly three}} decades to {{property}} disputes, environmental concerns and resistance from business owners in Buzzards Bay village, who claimed the freeway would divert all the traffic, and their business, elsewhere, leaving a ghost town in its wake. The proposed alignment ran through land {{where much of the}} state's cranberry harvest was located, and this led to lengthy lawsuits and delays. In particular, farmers were concerned that salt runoff from winter ice removal would harm cranberry harvests. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the MassDPW developed several proposals to control storm water runoff and avoid potential damage to the cranberry crops. Engineers for the department developed four different drainage systems to be used {{along the length of the}} freeway that would divert runoff away from the Wareham River basin. In addition, the freeway was planned with a thicker asphalt pavement that was largely <b>impervious</b> to water.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the {{embankment}} began on September 16, 1968 using the hydraulic fill method. The dam's massive concrete emergency spillway was completed on January 19, 1969. However, severe flooding on January 26 destroyed the cofferdam {{and all of}} the construction site's bridges, putting work a month behind schedule. Cleanup proceeded at a rapid pace and placing of <b>impervious</b> material for the dam's core commenced on February 27. For the next fifteen months, a fleet of massive 125-ton (113 t) dump trucks delivered an almost constant stream of dirt and rock to the site, and the dam wall rose at an average rate of one and a half feet (0.5 m) per day. The workforce peaked at 500 men in mid-1969 and on December 10, the service spillway was completed. On May 28, 1970, {{the embankment}} was finally topped out with the last of over 250,000 truckloads of material.|$|E
5|$|Henry re-granted Pevensey Castle to Gilbert I de l'Aigle but {{continued}} {{to use it for}} his own purposes, as happened in 1101 when he spent the summer at Pevensey to deter a threatened invasion by Duke Robert of Normandy. Pevensey was confiscated again by the Crown under King Stephen, with Gilbert's family also losing the rest of their possessions. It was subsequently re-granted to Gilbert de Clare, 1st Earl of Pembroke, who switched his allegiance to Stephen's cousin and rival, the Empress Matilda, in 1141. Although Gilbert changed his loyalty back to Stephen the following year, he was taken hostage by the king in 1147 after a revolt by Gilbert's uncle, Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester. A promise to surrender the Clare family's castles secured Gilbert's release but {{as soon as he was}} freed, he too rebelled. In response, Stephen undertook the second siege of Pevensey Castle with a land and sea blockade. The castle once again proved <b>impervious</b> to direct assault but the garrison was eventually starved out.|$|E
5|$|Newspapers {{reported}} that Myers had {{a monopoly on}} the making of hydrogen gas balloons and was the only producer in the United States of these balloons for the government. A loft in the Myers house was made available for a sewing area of balloon materials to make the large balloons. The fabric material was patterned, sewed together into large strips, and made ready for varnishing. He had a patent of a fabric made from sea island cotton that {{was used for the}} varnish application. Myers' patented varnish formula made the fabric <b>impervious</b> to hydrogen. The varnish used to seal the fabric material for the balloon envelopes was prepared in a low pit outdoors in a ravine behind the house. This was below ground level so the fabric being prepared was sheltered from the wind. It also provided a fire-pit in case the flammable material caught on fire. There was a water-hose handy for putting out a fire.|$|E
5|$|One day, {{however, the}} mirror tells her {{that there is}} a new fairest woman in the land, her 14-year-old stepdaughter, Princess Snow White. She became obsessively jealous of the princess' {{emerging}} beauty, therefore turning her into a scullery maid in her own home. After observing the handsome Prince from another kingdom singing a love song to Snow White, the proud Queen, in a jealous rage, commands her faithful Huntsman, Humbert, to take the princess deep into the forest and kill her. He is ordered to bring back her heart in a box to prove that he had done so. But Humbert cannot bear to kill the young princess upon realizing that she is <b>impervious</b> to harm, so he tells Snow White of the Queen's plot and tells her to run away and never to come back. To escape the penalty, he comes back with a pig's heart and gives it to the Queen. When she questions her mirror, it again replies that Snow White is the fairest in the land, and that she is living at the cottage of the Seven Dwarfs, revealing that the box contains the heart of a pig. The Dwarfs are fearful of the Queen's black magic but decide to take in Snow White anyway.|$|E
5|$|The Taken are {{protected}} by a shield of darkness, initially rendering them <b>impervious</b> to attack; they can only be injured with a firearm after exposure to light, which burns the darkness away. This puts significant emphasis on flashlights in conjunction with conventional weapons, such as a revolver or shotgun. Flashlight beams act as a reticle. The handheld lights Wake can carry can be boosted, which destroys the darkness faster, but also reduces the light's battery level. Besides the conventional shooter gameplay need for reloading ammunition, the player must also insert fresh batteries into the flashlight when they run out, or {{wait for it to}} recharge slowly. The strength of the darkness protecting an enemy can vary among the Taken. The amount of darkness remaining is represented by a corona of light that appears when aiming at an enemy, and a stronger darkness may recharge over time. When a Taken is finally destroyed, it disappears.|$|E
5|$|The {{secretions}} {{from the}} parasite give the Nemesis massively heightened regenerative abilities, which {{result in the}} creature being almost <b>impervious</b> to damage; although it can be put down with enough fire from small arms, eventually it will repair itself and resume the pursuit of its targets. However, this resulted in unexpected side effects, including damage to the skin {{and the emergence of}} additional tentacles, as well as unpredictable mutations caused by further attacks. In Resident Evil 3, the creature's survival instincts eventually override Nemesis' programming, causing the host's body to reject the parasite and transform into a giant digestive organ. Featuring large central bone protrusions and elongated tentacles, it crawls looking for prey, yet continues trying to complete its mission despite its now diminished intelligence. This design proved to be the most difficult for the game's development team, as they worked {{to try to make it}} appear as unique as possible.|$|E
5|$|Working in his {{laboratory}} {{to develop new}} corrosion-resistant metals for auto parts, Haynes discovered that mixing tungsten with chromium, steel and iron resulted {{in the formation of}} strong and lightweight alloys that were <b>impervious</b> to corrosion, and could endure high temperatures. In 1912, he formed Haynes Stellite Company to produce one of the new alloys, and received lucrative contracts during World War I, making Haynes a millionaire in 1916. He sold his patent for stainless steel to the American Stainless Steel Company in exchange for enough stock to gain a seat at the company's board of directors, a position he held for 12 years. He merged the Haynes Stellite company with Union Carbide in 1920. After passing through different owners, the company was renamed and is now called Haynes International. Haynes returned his focus to his automotive company, but in the economic recession of the 1920s the business went bankrupt and was liquidated.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eighteenth}} century the {{development}} of the Grand Tour took young Scottish aristocrats to the continent, particularly Rome, which was home to the exiled Jacobite Stuarts. This in turn fuelled interest in classical and Renaissance styles, and the buying of artistic works, particularly sculptures. However, the only major Scottish collection of marble before the nineteenth century was that of James Johnstone, 2nd Marquess of Annandale. As in England, commissions of new statuary tended to be crafted in relatively cheap lead and even more economical painted or gilded plaster. The plasterwork of John Cheere's yard in London was particularly in demand. Also important was the work from the yard of John Bacon (1740–99). Bacon was also a partner in Mrs Eleanor Coade's Artificial Stone Manufactory at Lambeth in London. This produced a buff coloured ceramic that could be moulded to provide fine detail, and be fired in sections, but was <b>impervious</b> to frost and fire. Much cheaper than carved stone, Coadstone was used for sphinxes, balustrading, capitals, coats of arms, tablets and ornamental vases. It was used extensively by the Adam brothers, particularly in the houses they built in Scotland, such as Cullen, Banff, Culzean Castle, Ayrshire, Dunbar Castle, East Lothian, Gosford House, East Lothian and Wedderburn, Berwickshire. They also supplied sculpture, candelabra and cippi that made up the neo-classical Adam Style.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} an open world environment with a day-night cycle and dynamic weather system {{which can be}} seamlessly explored. The map is composed of forest, jungle, desert, and snowy mountain regions. Mountainous terrain is traversed with the employment of parkour, which is aided {{by the use of}} zip-lines installed throughout the world. Corruption Zones constitute areas that heighten difficulty and are populated by corrupted machines that behave with more aggression. To uncover more of the map, one must scale large giraffe-like machines known as Tallnecks. Twenty-five robotic creature designs are present in the game. Save points and fast travel can be accessed by interacting with campfires, once discovered. The quest structure unfolds to accommodate the exploration of tribes, while the main story covers the entire world. Side quests involve Aloy completing tasks, like gathering materials, coming to the aid of individuals in danger of being killed, solving mysteries, assuming control of bandit camps, eliminating criminals and more difficult machines, accomplishing various challenges at any of the five Hunting Grounds, and obtaining an ancient armour that makes Aloy almost <b>impervious</b> to damage. A dialogue wheel is used to communicate with non-playable characters. Collectibles include vantages that offer visual information of the Old World; metal flowers, which when acquired contain poetry; and old relics, such as ancient mugs and tribal artefacts.|$|E
25|$|Hicks Creek {{flows through}} several sub-basins, {{including}} 1B, 1C, 2, 3, 4A, 6A, and 8A. The first {{three of these}} contain no <b>impervious</b> surfaces. However, sub-basin 3 contains 22.2 percent <b>impervious</b> surface and 20.0 percent of sub-basin 4A is <b>impervious.</b> A total of 30.0 and 42.7 percent of sub-basins 6A and 8A consist of <b>impervious</b> surfaces, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Although {{most of the}} {{watershed}} of Ackerly Creek has relatively little <b>impervious</b> cover, an area in {{the watershed}}'s southernmost reach has approximately 40 percent <b>impervious</b> cover. The creek has a relatively broad and developed floodplain in Dalton. At least one railroad bridge crosses the creek.|$|E
25|$|Working {{models and}} {{attachment}} orientations are relatively stable over time, {{but they are}} not <b>impervious</b> to change.|$|E
25|$|For {{this type}} of dam, it is {{essential}} to have an <b>impervious</b> foundation with high bearing strength.|$|E
25|$|Apart from rooftops, tanks {{may also}} be set up to collect {{rainwater}} from concrete patios, driveways and other <b>impervious</b> surfaces.|$|E
25|$|Various sculptural {{fragments}} {{were also}} found, {{in a rather}} conventional, classical style, rather <b>impervious</b> to the Hellenizing innovations occurring {{at the same time}} in the Mediterranean world.|$|E
25|$|Gaza is {{a coastal}} plain, {{bordering}} the Negev desert which witnesses flash floods during heavy rains as water runs {{across the surface}} of the <b>impervious</b> desert soil.|$|E
25|$|Because {{tailings}} dams often store {{toxic chemicals}} from the mining process, {{they have an}} <b>impervious</b> liner to prevent seepage. Water/slurry levels in the tailings pond must be managed for stability and environmental purposes as well.|$|E
25|$|The eastern Deccan plateau, called Telangana, {{is made of}} vast {{sheets of}} massive granite rock, which {{effectively}} traps rainwater. Under the thin surface layer of soil is the <b>impervious</b> gray granite bedrock. It rains here only during some months.|$|E
25|$|Each {{kernel of}} popcorn {{contains}} {{a certain amount}} of moisture and oil. Unlike most other grains, the outer hull of the popcorn kernel is both strong and <b>impervious</b> to moisture and the starch inside consists almost entirely of a hard type.|$|E
