40|$|High-volume {{microassembly}} on {{an industrial}} scale with a positioning accuracy better than ± 5 ?m is currently achieved by either serial kinematic robots with stacked linear axes or parallel SCARA robots. Future microassembly applications will surpass {{the need for}} clean room laboratories and will for example also enhance car body parts in the automotive industry with new functionalities. In light of this, {{there is a need}} for the high accuracy used in microassembly to be applied to larger parts. Due to technical effects these microassembly robots cannot simply be scaled up. Therefore when excluding the technical issue of the sensor guiding system the question for the right choice of handling robot kinematic arises. The paper compares a <b>gantry</b> <b>type</b> microassembly <b>robot</b> with stacked linear axes and a new approach consisting of an articulated robot arm with a fine positioning unit at the tool tip. The existing systems and future scaled-up systems with similar kinematics are compared in terms of economic and technological benefits. Economic issues are acquisition cost and cost of ownership, but also the achievable cycle times for a given scenario. Furthermore, the ease of integration into existing manufacturing systems is compared. From the technical viewpoint, accuracy and repeatability are basic requirements for microassembly. The ease of control, the flexibility of the systems and the reliability are other technical issues considered...|$|R

30|$|From {{the results}} of the experiments, the {{construction}} process by the one-part foam <b>type</b> <b>robot</b> uses more material and takes longer, mainly because of the curing process and waiting time for curing (1 h). However, it is useful for filling a ditch or a hole. The foam expands in a horizontal direction without any expansion in the vertical direction. Thus, the foam fills the gaps between structures, and the robot can build a composite structure. Although the two-part foam <b>type</b> <b>robot</b> is useful for all building tasks, the two-part foam construction process requires accurate sensing and position control. In addition, each foam structure is built separately, causing the final structure to have an undulating surface. These issues may be considered weaknesses in more complex environments.|$|R
