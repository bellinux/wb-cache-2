Being given the lower frequency of service on weekdays and Saturdays, except Thursdays (racing), we can perfectly accept the reduction to ten trips to those going from the racecourse to the forest, but, concerning the part of the journey from Trianon to the racecourse, it is imperative that the Chief Engineer (Lechelas) keeps the minimum to 30, otherwise there will be a kind of abandonment of the line, because for this small distance, it will not be possible to get reasonable traffic with more frequent departures.|$|E

25|$|Chemicals {{are also}} used for sterilization. Heating {{provides}} a reliable way to rid objects of all transmissible agents, {{but it is not}} always appropriate <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> damage heat-sensitive materials such as biological materials, fiber optics, electronics, and many plastics. In these situations chemicals, either as gases or in liquid form, can be used as sterilants. While the use of gas and liquid chemical sterilants avoids the problem of heat damage, users must ensure that article to be sterilized is chemically compatible with the sterilant being used. In addition, the use of chemical sterilants poses new challenges for workplace safety, as the properties that make chemicals effective sterilants usually make them harmful to humans.|$|E

As he freezes to death, he radios Capa to escape the airlock, decouple the bomb from the ship, and activate it as it plummets into the sun, delivering the payload to its destination. Capa blows the airlock, separates the bomb from the ship, which explodes, and enters the payload, where he finds Cassie. Pinbacker ambushes them, telling them God ordered him to send all humanity to Heaven. As they hurtle into the sun, Capa escapes Pinbacker, reaching the bomb controls. Not sure <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> work under these extreme conditions, he watches as the bomb begins to successfully ignite {{at the edge of}} the sun itself.|$|E

It will serve both to participate in humanitarian and warlike missions.

He also mentions that he is starting to feel relieved that nothing serious has gone wrong. Just as they discuss their honeymoon, Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) calls round to tell the couple that the ballroom at Lassister's Hotel has raw sewage running through it and the kitchen is out of order. Toadie asks Paul how they can have the reception there and Paul tells them that he has arranged a marquee for them in the hotel's grounds. He will also give them the use of a suite for the day, as a gesture of good will. After Paul leaves, Sonya tries to calm Toadie down.|$|E
25|$|The {{momentum}} {{to create a}} new honour typically originates at either the Chancellery of Honours or the Department of National Defence, though private organisations or individuals may also make proposals. The chancellery will investigate whether or not the suggested honour is necessary and <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> conform within the national honours structure. Should it meet these criteria, the notion is put before the Honours Policy Committee—a group of senior public servants, formed in 1980 within the Privy Council Office—and then, if approved, is moved before the Cabinet for an Order in Council to be drawn up. On the prime minister's advice, via the governor general, the documents and drawings for the new honour are presented to the Queen for her consideration; only with her signature on the relevant letters patent and the design sketches does the new honour officially become extant. Any future amendments to the honour's appearance or award criteria do not need the monarch's approval; the governor general will perform such tasks instead.|$|E
