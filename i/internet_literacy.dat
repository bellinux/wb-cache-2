2500|$|Multimodality in the 21st {{century has}} caused {{educational}} institutions to consider changing {{the forms of}} even its traditional aspects of classroom education. According to Hassett and Curwood, authors of Theories and Practices of Multimodal Education, “Print represents only one mode of communication…” and with a rise in digital and <b>Internet</b> <b>literacy,</b> other modes are needed, from visual texts to digital e-books. Other changes occur by integrating music and video with lesson plans during early childhood education; however, such measures are seen as augmenting and increasing literacy for educational communities by introducing new forms, rather than replacing literacy values. In several children’s books released today, written language is no longer the most important factor while producing these books. According to Miller and McVee, authors of Multimodal Composing in Classrooms, “These new literacies do not set aside traditional literacies. Students still {{need to know how to}} read and write, but new literacies are integrated." [...] The main purpose of early childhood education is still evident but the form that is now being presented to children is different. Some learning outcomes include – but are not limited to – reading, writing, and language skills. For example, “Multimodal Composing In Classrooms,” written by Miller and McVee, advocates storyboarding as an assignment and says that it “is multimodal in that there is the visual and audio of a film clip, the drawing representation of the film’s images, as well as the written analysis of the scene." [...] According to Roger Essley in his article, [...] "Visual Tools for Differentiating Reading & Writing Instruction," [...] storyboarding is “the origin of all written language. Teachers are able to use storyboards for visual organization to strengthen writing skills and help the writing process. They can be used in brainstorming sessions, problem solving, planning, and much more.|$|E

50|$|Project harmony brought {{together}} organizations and private donors {{to invest in}} ICT projects for Armenia. These projects were meant {{to help build a}} demonstration network of 24-internet- connected secondary schools from the city of Yerevan and a few regions close to the capital. This led to two following grants in support of the Armenia School Connectivity Program, eventually reaching across Armenia, and creating a network of 330 secondary schools with an Internet Computer Center (ICC). The program hired and appropriately trained approximately 600 ICC staff. The people responsible for the ICC program created outreach activities and information literacy programs for the local community. For the isolated and under-served communities of Armenia, project harmony expanded Internet accessibility through the Mobile Internet Lab project. The purpose of the Mobile Internet Lab was to ride through Armenia, offering basic computer and <b>Internet</b> <b>literacy</b> to the school and community members in remote villages.

40|$|<b>Internet</b> {{information}} <b>literacy</b> has {{the potential}} to open the whole world of knowledge to easy access and use. Computer <b>literacy</b> and <b>Internet</b> readiness alone do not empower the learner to capitalise {{on the use of the}} Internet to acquire useful knowledge. Without information literacy, the learner would be overwhelmed not only by the information overload but also by being confronted with the amount of unreliable information posted on the Internet. Therefore this paper looks at how the Internet age might influence the ways that students learn and how to capitalise on it to prepare those students for the digital world of today and how to be empowered for the future challenges of the increasing complexities of tomorrow. The findings indicate that the integration of discipline-specific <b>Internet</b> information <b>literacy</b> into the curriculum is essential before we can enhance student learning using the Internet for resource-based learning. It is also to equip them with relevant information management skills and the ability to learn independently. These are fundamental skills required to become emerging lifelong learners in the midst of an information explosion so as to be able to meet the challenges of the 21 st century and the knowledge economy. ...|$|R

50|$|Due to {{unprecedented}} {{increasing number}} of enrollees in San Pablo City National High School. The SPCNHS can no longer accommodate all {{the students in the}} city. The City Government of San Pablo City decided to established satellite schools across the barangay called annex to solve the problem. One of the barangays for establishing satellite secondary school is Barangay Santisimo. Elias Corales† the barangay chairman on that time donated a hectare land in order to build a barangay secondary school named Santisimo Rosario Annex according to Kapasyahan Blg. 93-3 dated July 1, 1993. In 1995 Santisimo Annex was started as a single three-room building standing in an open field without fences. Four pioneer teachers were assigned in Santisimo Rosario Annex named Ronie Nacario was the first designated as Teacher-in-Charge, Teresa Yema, Maritess Fandiño, and Michelle D. Benedictos. In 1996 Editha L. Fule assigned as Teacher-in-Charge of Santisimo Annex. Since 1996 more additional school buildings are constructed {{with the help of the}} local government, parents and teachers' association (PTA), and Non-Government Organizations (NGO). In 1999, first commencement exercises (4-year curriculum) of rosarians was held in Rizal Hall, San Pablo City Central School. In 2001 the school perimeter fence was built. A major school landscape was initiated by the freshmen in 2003 also the institution hires Jayson Bargados, the first security guard for the school's security. The first computer room was built in 2004 with the help of Personal Computers for Public Schools (PCPS) program by Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). In 2005 major restructuring of faculty members occurred. Half of the original faculty members were transferred to other schools and replaced with newer set of teaching force and in the same year Santisimo Annex gained independence from San Pablo City National High School and renamed as Santisimo Rosario National High School. After gaining a new school identity, white-green uniform were replaced by aqua green in 2006. Using of flash drives as storage devices instead of floppy disks for saving documents was introduced and another school renovation lead by school volunteer Paulton Sityar was held on the same year. First internet access was made possible by Gearing Up <b>Internet</b> <b>Literacy</b> & Access for Students (GILAS) project in 2007 spearheaded by Airnel Abarra also treehouse was built inside the campus for the preparation of hosting Science Camp. In 2012 Physical Education uniforms were standardized. Due to the remoteness of Barangay Atisan which was located on the foot of the Mount Malepunyo and San Isidro National High School and can no longer accommodate more students from that barangay, the SRNHS extension was established.|$|E

By means of surveys, interviews and participant observations, it interrogates the literacies that are perceived by ASRs as most important for their integration in their Johannesburg communities and whether literacy needs change over time. It begins {{with a sample of}} thirty subjects and ends with two participant observation participants, narrowing the sample size to ten, then five and finally two, based on the importance of information on literacies susceptible of being retrieved from the subject‟s data. The data was analysed within the framework of theories on social literacies and Berry‟s integration theory. Key findings are that in the ASRs‟ opinion, firstly, being able to communicate in English increases one‟s chances of finding employment, engaging in trading activities and operating efficiently in Johannesburg. Secondly, being able to communicate in a local language made it easier for ASRs to build successful social relationships with locals. Thirdly, computer <b>literacies</b> and <b>Internet</b> <b>literacies</b> may mostly be beneficial if the ASRs already have a profession, trade, skill or occupation. Findings from this research provide a foundation for more investigation into the literacies needs of ASRs, the factors that facilitate the acquisition of these literacies and their impact on the ASRs‟ lives {{in the context of their}} Johannesburg communities...|$|R
