5|$|By 1835 {{the idea}} of {{building}} a railway from Glasgow into Ayrshire gained sufficient support for a survey to be commissioned from John Miller, a partner <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> of Grainger and Miller, which had been heavily involved in the earlier railways in the west of Scotland. Miller proposed a route from Tradeston, in Glasgow {{at the south end}} of Glasgow Bridge, through Paisley and the Garnock Valley to Kilwinning and Ayr, with a branch from Dalry to Kilmarnock. The cost was to be £550,000 and a 10% return could be expected; notwithstanding the south-westerly course of the line, it was foreseen as a first step towards linking with railways in England.|$|E

5|$|After {{graduating from}} Duke, Nixon {{initially}} hoped {{to join the}} Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Sverdrup owned 60% and Parcel 40%of the new firm, which opened its doors on 1 April 1928. The company's headquarters was located in St. Louis, Missouri. Sverdrup & Parcel's first contract was for the design of a bridge over the Missouri River at Hermann, Missouri, for which it received a fee of $33,000. While at the Missouri State Highway Department Sverdrup met D. C. Wolfe and E. R. Grant, and he asked them if they would join the company. Sverdrup subsequently hired design engineer Brice R.

5|$|The {{following}} year, in July 2008, KKR {{announced a}} new plan to list its shares. The plan called for KKR to complete a reverse takeover of its listed affiliate KKR Private Equity Investors {{in exchange for a}} 21% interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm.</b> In November 2008, KKR announced a delay of this transaction until 2009. Shares of KPE had declined significantly {{in the second half of}} 2008 with the onset of the credit crunch. KKR has announced that it expects to close the transaction in 2009. In October 2009, KKR listed shares in KKR & Co. on the Euronext exchange, replacing KPE and anticipates a listing on the New York Stock Exchange in 2010.

5|$|Upon {{graduation}} Paton joined Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners, {{which had}} been founded in 1922. One of his first jobs there was {{to assist with the}} design of a new jetty for Barking Power Station. In 1927 he worked on a dam at Maentwrog in North Wales and between 1932 and 1933 was resident engineer on the Glenlee portion of the Galloway hydro-electric power scheme. Paton was seconded to the Rangoon Port Trust in 1930 to construct a wharf for the export of Lead from Burma. This wharf survived a serious earthquake on 5 May 1930 and was opened on 20 February 1931. On 10 April 1931 Paton sailed to Canada to undertake a survey of its ports and outline the additional facilities that would be required in the next 25–50 years. He was assisted in this for six weeks by Ralph Freeman who had designed the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The report was issued on 15 January 1932 but was not implemented until 1935 with the election of William Lyon Mackenzie King as Prime Minister of Canada. The report's findings continued to be in use until the 1970s. Paton was responsible {{for the construction of a}} new brewery for Guinness in Park Royal, London from October 1933 to October 1936. This was the biggest job of his career thus far and involved the construction of seven steel framed buildings, a power station, a storage silo, roads and railway sidings. Paton also built industrial and trading estates in Wales, West Cumberland and London. He was made a partner <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> in 1938.|$|E
