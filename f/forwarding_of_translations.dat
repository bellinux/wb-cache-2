This paper describes the re-cent extensions of HENSHIN by a visual editor for triple graph grammars (TGGs). The visual editor (called HENSHINTGG) supports a compact visualization of triple rules in an integrated editor panel. Internally, triple graph rules are represented as HENSHIN rules and can be simulated using the HENSHIN EMF model transforma-tion engine. Our extension supports the automatic generation <b>of</b> <b>forward</b> <b>translation</b> rules for transforming source into target models. A converter from HENSHIN TGG rules to the graph transformation analysis tool AGG allows a systematic check for conflicts <b>of</b> <b>forward</b> <b>translation</b> rules in AGG based on critical pair analysis...|$|R

Despite {{the high degree}} of evolutionary conservation in the sequences of their GTP-binding domains, the rates of GTP hydrolysis and nucleotide exchange vary broadly between different trGTPases. EF-Tu, one of the best-characterized model G proteins, evolved an exceptionally rapid and tightly regulated GTPase activity, which ensures rapid and accurate incorporation of amino acids into the nascent chain.

40|$|How are {{visual and}} {{physical}} motion cues integrated in self-motion perception? We performed a psychophysical study to test how forward accelerations can be realistically simulated. Participants were {{seated on a}} 6 dof Stewart motion platform and viewed a computer-generated visual scene on a projection screen (54 × 40. 5). The visual scene consisted of a randomly structured ground plane and sky. Observers were told that eye height was always 2 m above ground. In each of the 180 trials, participants experienced a brief simulated forward acceleration (4 s ramp, followed by 2 s of constant acceleration) that was presented both as platform motion and motion within the visual scene. After the acceleration, the screen went dark and the platform returned to zero in 6 s. Participants used a joystick to indicate the realism <b>of</b> the <b>forward</b> acceleration experienced. They were explicitly told to give high ratings for trials in which they convincingly felt moving forward {{in accordance with the}} visual stimulus, and low ratings in trials in which they noticed conflicts. In each trial, stimuli were chosen randomly within fixed intervals for all six varied parameters: visual forward accelerations (0 – 1. 5 m/s^ 2), platform backwards pitch (0 – 15), brief <b>forward</b> <b>translations</b> <b>of</b> the platform (0 – 0. 5 m in 4 s), ratio of acceleration/deceleration durations for the translations (0. 11 – 1. 5), and up/down noise simulating ground roughness (0 – 7 cm) using low-pass filtered noise (cosine window, 0. 3 – 1 s). Multiple hierarchical regression analyses performed for each subject revealed that only two parameters had a clear influence on the ratings: higher platform pitches and higher visual accelerations induced a better impression <b>of</b> being accelerated <b>forward.</b> Brief <b>forward</b> <b>translations</b> <b>of</b> the platform and bumps increased believability for some observers.

Methods Nineteen participants walked for two minutes on a motorized treadmill as a horizontal actuator assisted the <b>forward</b> <b>translation</b> <b>of</b> the center of mass during the stance phase. All subjects walked at a self-select speed that had a medium-high velocity. The actuator provided assistive forces equal to 0, 3, 6 and 9 percent of the participant's body weight. The largest Lyapunov exponent, which measures the nonlinear structure, was calculated for the hip, knee and ankle joint time series. A repeated measures one-way analysis of variance with a t-test post hoc was used to determine significant differences in the nonlinear gait dynamics. Results The magnitude of the largest Lyapunov exponent systematically increased as the percent assistance provided by the mechanical actuator was increased. Conclusion These results support our model's prediction that control <b>of</b> the <b>forward</b> progression <b>of</b> the center of mass influences the nonlinear gait dynamics. The inability to control the <b>forward</b> progression <b>of</b> the center of mass during the stance phase may be the reason the nonlinear gait dynamics are altered in pathological populations. However, these conclusions need to be further explored at a range of walking speeds. </p...|$|R
40|$|Epub {{ahead of}} printThe {{aim of this}} study was to compare the kinetic and {{kinematic}} parameters of standing and crouch sprint starts. Parallel starts (PS), false starts (FS), jump starts (JS) and crouch starts (3 PS) were compared. Eighteen participants performed each start on a force plate and six infrared cameras captured the three-dimensional coordinates of 36 retro-reflective markers. Performance during a five-metre sprint (T 5 m) was analysed. Duration of the start phase (Tstart), mean values of horizontal and total ground reaction forces (GRFs) (Fx_mean and Ftot_mean), ratio of force (RF), maximal power (Pmax) and kinetic energy (KE) of each limb were calculated. Significant differences were found for T 5 m, Tstart, KE, Pmax, Fx_mean, Ftot_mean and RF for the crouch start compared to the other starts (P ≤q 0. 05). Significant correlations were found between T 5 m and Tstart (r = 0. 59; P ≤q 0. 001), and T 5 m and Pmax, Fx_mean and RF (- 0. 73 ≤q r ≤q - 0. 61; P ≤q 0. 001). To conclude, the crouch start resulted in the best performance because Tstart was shorter, producing greater Pmax, Fx_mean with a more <b>forward</b> orientation <b>of</b> the resultant force. Greater KE of the trunk in each start condition demonstrated the role of the trunk in generating <b>forward</b> <b>translation</b> <b>of</b> the centre of mass (CM) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{template}} {{model of}} human visual self-motion perception (Perrone, JOSA, 1992; Perrone & Stone, Vis. Res., in press), which uses neurophysiologically realistic "heading detectors", {{is consistent with}} numerous human psychophysical results (Warren & Hannon, Nature, 1988; Stone & Perrone, Neuro. Abstr., 1991) including the failure of humans to estimate their heading (direction <b>of</b> <b>forward</b> <b>translation)</b> accurately under certain visual conditions (Royden et al., Nature, 1992). We tested the model detectors with stimuli used by others in- single-unit studies. The detectors showed emergent properties {{similar to those of}} MST neurons: 1) Sensitivity to non-preferred flow. Each detector is tuned to a specific combination of flow components and its response is systematically reduced by the addition of nonpreferred flow (Orban et al., PNAS, 1992), and 2) Position invariance. The detectors maintain their apparent preference for particular flow components over large regions of their receptive fields (e. g. Duffy & Wurtz, J. Neurophys., 1991; Graziano et al., J. Neurosci., 1994). It has been argued that this latter property is incompatible with MST playing a role in heading perception. The model however demonstrates how neurons with the above response properties could still support accurate heading estimation within extrastriate cortical maps...|$|R
