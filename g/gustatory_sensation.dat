In addition, the physicochemical properties of the syrups in a solid state were compared. Evaluation of sweetness with a powdered sample revealed significant differences between formulation A and formulation B and between formulation B and formulation C. In contrast, the results of principal component analysis (PCA) with a taste sensor revealed differences in principal component 1 (PC 1) among formulations A, B, and C. Smell sensor measurement of powdered samples revealed differences in products in terms of only PC 1, but these results were not related to the results of <b>gustatory</b> <b>sensation</b> testing with a smell sensor. Measurement of particle size distribution and scanning electron microscopy revealed differences in the particle diameter and particle surface shape for each product. Formulation B had the strongest absorption in the near-infrared spectrum, followed by formulation A and then formulation C. Accordingly, differences in preparations were presumably caused by variations in manufacturing specifications, such as types of additives and their content and coating methods used. In other words, the characteristics of each product were revealed by evaluation of their physical properties, sensing of taste and smell, and human <b>gustatory</b> <b>sensation</b> tests...|$|E

40|$|Quality {{evaluation}} of traditional balsamic vinegar (TBV) is primarily based on sensory analysis. For every TBV batch, official sensory panels give a final score, which determines its assessment into quality and price categories.

Loose leaf Gymnema sylvestre can be prepared as a tea and will impair the ability to taste sugar by blocking sweet receptors on the tongue. This report describes a laboratory exercise easily applied to an undergraduate neuroscience course {{that can be used to}} illustrate the principles of <b>gustatory</b> <b>sensation.</b> Combined with a preceding lecture on the primary taste sensations, students experience and appreciate how the primary tastes are combined to produce overall taste. In addition, the exercises outlined here expand upon previously published demonstrations employing Gymnema sylvestre to include illustrations of the different sensory transduction mechanisms associated with each of the four or five primary taste modalities. Students compare their qualitative primary taste experiences to salt, sugar, aspartame, chocolate, and sweet-sour candy prior to and following exposure to Gymnema sylvestre. The herb’s impairment of sweet sensation is profound and dramatically alters the perception of sweetness in sugar, chocolate, and candy without altering the perception of the other primary tastes.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to prepare and to {{investigate}} acetaminophen taste-masked granules obtained in a high-shear mixer using three different wet granulation methods (method A: water granulation, method B: granulation with a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) binding solution and method C: steam granulation). The studied formulation was: acetaminophen 15 %, -lactose monohydrate 30 %, cornstarch 45 %, polyvinylpyrrolidone K 30 5 % and orange flavour 5 % (w/w). In vitro dissolution studies, performed at pH 6. 8, showed that steam granules enabled the lower dissolution rate in comparison to the water and binding solution granules; these results were then confirmed by their lower surface reactivity (DR) during the dissolution process. Moreover, the results of the <b>gustatory</b> <b>sensation</b> test performed by six volunteers confirmed the taste-masking effects of the granules, especially steam granules (P < 0. 001). Morphological, fractal and porosity analysis were then performed to explain the dissolution profiles and the results of the <b>gustatory</b> <b>sensation</b> test. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis revealed the smoother and the more regular surface of steam granules with respect to the samples obtained using methods A and B; these results were also confirmed by their lower fractal dimension (Ds) and porosity values. Finally, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results showed a shift of the melting point of the drug, which was due to the simple mixing of the components and not to the granulation processes. In conclusion, the steam granulation technique resulted a suitable method to comply the purpose of this work, without modifying the availability of the drug. © 2003 Elsevier B. V.

A Positron Emission Tomography (PET) activation study was then performed on a separate group of healthy subjects to ascertain brain regions involved in the perception of citric acid. A role for the right anterior temporal lobe in taste quality recognition was elucidated in that experiment.

40|$|International audienceBackground: Osteopathic {{manipulative}} treatment (OMT) of the sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) is used empirically for {{the treatment}} of rhinitis and snoring and is thought to increase pharyngeal stability. This trial was designed to study the effects of this treatment on pharyngeal stability evaluated by critical closing pressure in obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome. Methods: This single-centre, randomized, crossover, double-blind study compared active manipulation and sham manipulation of the SPG. Randomization was computer-generated. Patients each received one active manipulation and one sham manipulation at an interval of 21 days and were evaluated 30 min and 48 h after each session administered by a qualified osteopath. Neither the patients, nor the investigator performing the evaluations were informed about the order of the two techniques (double-blind). The primary endpoint was the percentage of responding patients presenting increased pharyngeal stability defined by a variation of critical closing pressure (Pcrit) of at least − 4 cmH 2 O at 30 min. Secondary endpoints were the variation of Pcrit in absolute values, sleepiness and snoring. Others endpoints were lacrimation (Schirmer’s test), induced pain, sensations experienced during OMT. Results: Ten patients were included and nine (57 [50; 58] years, comprising 7 men, with an apnoea-hypopnoea index of 31. 0 [25. 5; 33. 2]/h; (values are median [quartiles])) were analysed. Seven patients were analysed for the primary endpoint and nine patients were analysed for secondary endpoints. Five patients responded after active manipulation versus no patients after sham manipulation (p[*]=[*] 0. 0209). Active manipulation induced more intense pain (p[*]=[*] 0. 0089), increased lacrimation (ns) and more tactile, nociceptive and <b>gustatory</b> <b>sensations</b> (13 versus 1) compared to sham manipulation. No significant difference was observed for the other endpoints. Conclusions: Osteopathic manipulative treatment of the SPG may improve pharyngeal stability in obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome. This trial validates the feasibility of the randomized, controlled, double-blind methodology for evaluation of this osteopathic treatment. Studies on a larger sample size must specify the efficacy on the apnoea-hypopnoea index...|$|R
40|$|Hallucinations {{and other}} unusual sensory {{experiences}} (USE) {{can occur in}} all modalities in the general population. Yet, the existing literature is dominated by investigations into auditory hallucinations (“voices”), while other modalities remain under-researched. Furthermore, there is a paucity of measures which can systematically assess different modalities, which limits our ability to detect individual and group differences across modalities. The current study explored such differences using a new scale, the Multi-Modality Unusual Sensory Experiences Questionnaire (MUSEQ). The MUSEQ is a 43 -item self-report measure which assesses USE in six modalities: auditory, visual, olfactory, <b>gustatory,</b> bodily <b>sensations,</b> and sensed presence. Scale development and validation involved a total of 1, 300 participants, which included: 513 students and community members for initial development, 32 individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorder or bipolar disorder for validation, 659 students for factor replication, and 96 students for test-retest reliability. Confirmatory factor analyses showed that a correlated-factors model and bifactor model yielded acceptable model fit, while a unidimensional model fitted poorly. These findings were confirmed in the replication sample. Results showed contributions from a general common factor, as well as modality-specific factors. The latter accounted for less variance than the general factor, but could still detect theoretically meaningful group differences. The MUSEQ showed good reliability, construct validity, and could discriminate non-clinical and clinical groups. The MUSEQ offers a reliable means of measuring hallucinations and other USE in six different modalities...|$|R
40|$|Flavour {{perception}} {{is a complex}} combination of the olfactory, <b>gustatory</b> and trigeminal <b>sensations</b> perceived during eating. During this eating process, tastants must be dissolved into saliva to be transported to the taste bud receptor cell membranes and aroma compounds have {{to be released in}} the oral cavity then transferred to the nasal cavity to reach the olfactory receptors. This release highly depends on food composition and structure, on the molecular properties of the stimuli but also on physiological characteristics of individuals and mastication behaviour. However, interactions occur between texture, taste and aroma perception at different levels: physic-chemical interactions in the food product and during the chewing process, peripheral physiological interactions and cognitive interactions. Focusing on flavour release and perception in dairy products, this review will present the influence of food composition (fat, protein, salt) and structure, of the interindividual variability of the subjects (chewing behaviour, saliva, mouth coating, oral volumes), of the interaction between food products and subjects and of cognitive interactions...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The insula is {{important}} for <b>gustatory</b> <b>sensation,</b> motor speech control, vestibular function, and sympathetic control of cardiovascular tone. The {{purpose of this study}} was to test two hypotheses: 1) gross anatomic study of the insula will disclose reproducible patterns of insular structure, and 2) analysis of MR appearance will enable physicians to recognize these patterns on imaging studies. METHODS: Gross insular anatomy was determined in 16 normal human cadaveric hemi-spheres. The 1. 5 -T MR images of 300 insulae were analyzed to determine the gyral and sulcal patterns displayed; their relationship to the Heschl gyrus, to the overlying opercula, and to the vertical planes perpendicular to the Talairach-Tournoux baseline at the anterior commissure (VAC) and posterior commissure (VPC); their continuity into the orbitofrontal cortex; and appropriate landmarks for the anterior border, apex, and posterior border of the insula. RESULTS: MR images displayed the central sulcus of the insula (97 %); the anterior (99 %), middle (78 %), and posterior (98 %) short insular gyri that converge to the apex (100 %) anteriorly; and the anterior (99 %) and posterior (58 %) long insular gyri posteriorly.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to mask the intensely bitter taste of primaquine phosphate (PRM) and to formulate suspension powder (cachets) of the taste masked drug. Taste masking was done using beta-cyclodextrin. To characterize and formulate taste masked cachets of PRM, the 1 : 25  M physical mixture was selected based on bitterness score. Phase solubility studies, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) were performed to identify the physicochemical interaction between drug and carrier, hence its effect on dissolution. Cachets were evaluated for angle of repose, sedimentation characterization and pH. In vitro drug release studies for physical mixture and kneaded system were performed at pH, 1. 2 and 6. 8. Bitterness score was evaluated using <b>gustatory</b> <b>sensation</b> test. Phase solubility studies showed weak interaction between PRM and CD. The FTIR, DSC and XRPD studies indicated inclusion complexation in physical mixture and kneaded system. In addition, kneaded system and physical mixture exhibited better drug release at pH 1. 2 and negligible effect at pH 6. 8. Cachets prepared using physical mixture, (DS 24), showed complete bitter taste masking and easy redispersibility. Taste evaluation of cachets in human volunteers rated tasteless with a score of 0 to DS 24 and 3 to DS 25.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present investigation was to reduce the bitterness with improved dissolution, in acidic medium (pH  1. 2), of mefloquine hydrochloride (MFL). Microparticles were prepared by coacervation method using Eudragit E (EE) as polymer and sodium hydroxide as precipitant. A 32 full factorial design was used for optimization wherein the drug concentration (A) and polymer concentration (B) were selected as independent variables and the bitterness score, particle size and dissolution at various pH were selected as the dependent variables. The desirability function approach has been employed {{in order to find}} the best compromise between the different experimental responses. The model is further cross validated for bias. The optimized microparticles were characterized by FT-IR, DSC, XRPD and SEM. Bitterness score was evaluated by human <b>gustatory</b> <b>sensation</b> test. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the reduced bitterness of MFL can be obtained by controlling the dissolution of microparticles at pH  6. 8 and increasing the EE concentration. The increase in polymer concentration leads to reduction in dissolution of microparticles at pH[*]>[*] 5 due to its insolubility. However the dissolution studies at pH  1. 2 demonstrated enhanced dissolution of MFL from microparticles might be due to the high porosity of the microparticles, hydrophilic nature of the EE, and improved wettability, provided by the dissolved EE. The bitterness score of microparticles was decreased to zero compared to 3 + of pure ARM. In conclusion the bitterness of MFL was reduced with improved dissolution at acidic pH...|$|E

40|$|Flavor is {{a result}} of the complex {{combination}} of olfactory, <b>gustatory</b> and trigeminal <b>sensations</b> perceived during oral processing of foods, including thermal, painful, tactile and/or kinesthetic effects. Aim of this study was to better understand interactions between synchronous tactile (texture) and olfactory (odor) sensations, using a psychophysical and an electrophysiological approach. Texture stimuli were aliquots of lean milk and thickened lean milk. A butter aroma was presented either orthonasally or retronasally after oral processing and before swallowing the oral stimulus or in the absence of an oral stimulus. Eighteen subjects (11 women, 7 men, mean age 24 years), naïve to the expected effects, rated both odor and texture intensity of each stimulus. Event-related potentials (ERP) were obtained from five recording positions. For the psychophysical data, the presence of an oral stimulus increased odor intensity, irrespective of odor presentation route. For the electrophysiological data, both early and late chemosensory ERPs were affected by odor conditions, texture conditions, and their respective interaction. In conclusion: (1) perceptual interactions occurred between food texture and odor, with cross-modal interactions being found for both orthonasal and retronasal odor administration, and (2) these interactions between texture and odor occur at both primary-sensory and cognitive evaluative levels of stimulus processing. The temporal dimension plays then a critical role in the investigation of odor–texture interactions...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} {{transformation}} of table olives {{is the result}} of complex biochemical reactions that are determined by the interactions of the indigenous microflora of the olives together with a variety of contaminating microrganisms from different sources (fiber-glass fermenters, PVC tanks, pipelines, pumps and water) with the compositional characteristics of the fruit. One of the most important aspects of improving the quality of table olives is the use of selected microorganisms to drive the fermentation. These can supplant the indigenous microflora and, in particular, the complementary microflora that are responsible for spoilage of canned olives. In this context, from a technological point of view, a well-characterised collection of microrganisms (lactic acid bacteria, yeasts) that is possibly isolated from the matrix to be processed (the olive fruit) will provide the basis for the development of starter culture systems. These cultures can be fully compatible with the typical products and guarantee high quality standards. Inoculation of the brine with such selected starter cultures will reduce the probability of spoilage and help to achieve an improved and more predictable fermentation process. Control of the fermentation processes can thus occur through chemical, chemico-physical and microbiological approaches, and since 2008 (COI/OT/MO/Doc. No 1. Method for the sensory analysis of table olives), also through organoleptic evaluation. This last has established the necessary criteria and procedures for sensory analysis of the negative, <b>gustatory</b> and kinaesthetic <b>sensations</b> of table olives that can also be attributed to abnormal proliferation of microrganisms. It also sets out the systematics for commercial classification, through the assessment of the median of the defect predominantly perceived...|$|R
40|$|Hedonic impact, or ‘liking, ’ is a {{critical}} aspect of reward. Food and sex, for example, are potent sensory pleasures with liked hedonic impact, and it is widely acknowledged that the ‘liking ’ of food and sex carries important survival and reproductive benefits for humans and animals. However, sensory pleasure {{may not always be}} beneficial. Rewards with large hedonic impact (e. g., junk food) may often be consumed more than those with low hedonic impact (e. g., vegetables), and in this way, hedonics may contribute to overeating and obesity and also to abuse of drugs. Although the ‘wanting ’ and ‘liking ’ of rewards are separable, pleasure ‘liking ’ may be a major contributor to normal and excessive reward consumption. Thus, it is important that behavioral neuroscience gains an under-standing of how the brain causes reward hedonic impact. So how does it? How does the brain transform a mere sensory stimulus into a pleasurable and liked stimulus? For example, taste sweetness by itself is merely a sensa-tion, so its pleasure must arise within the brain, where neural systems actively paint pleasure onto the <b>gustatory</b> <b>sensation</b> to generate a ‘liking ’ reaction, as a sort of “pleasure gloss ” (Berridge 2004). The question of how sensations are painted with pleasure to become liked can be answered in part by identifying which particular neu-ral systems are able to amplify objective indicators of the hedonic impact of natural rewards. Parts of the brain opioid system may be especially important in painting a pleasure gloss onto sensation in both humans and animals (Cooper 1983; Morley an...|$|E

Taste masking was done by solid dispersion with mono amino glycyrrhyzinate pentahydrate (GLY) by solvent evaporation method. To characterize and formulate taste masked rapid disintegrating tablets (RDTs) of ARM, the 1 : 1 M solid dispersion was selected based on bitterness score. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) were performed to identify the physicochemical interaction between drug and carrier, hence its effect on dissolution. RDTs were evaluated for weight variation, disintegration time, hardness and friability. In vitro drug release studies were performed for RDTs at pH  1. 2 and 6. 8. Bitterness score was evaluated using mini-column method and compared with <b>gustatory</b> <b>sensation</b> test. FTIR spectroscopy and DSC showed no interaction while XRPD showed amorphization of ARM in GLY solid dispersion. RDTs prepared using solid dispersion, (RDT 3), showed faster disintegration (within 28  s) and complete bitter taste masking of ARM. In addition, RDT 3 exhibited better dissolution profile at both pH  1. 2 and 6. 8, than RDTs prepared from pure ARM (RDT 5). Taste evaluation of RDTs in human volunteers rated tasteless with a score of 0 to RDT 3 and 3 to RDT 5. Mini-column revealed that RDT 5 showed increase in number of persons who sensed bitterness with increased amount of ARM release while RDT 3 sensed no bitterness.

The ATP-evoked responses of P 2 X 2 receptors are allosterically modulated by divalent zinc and protons. We have used site-directed mutagenesis and two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology to test whether any of the 34 extracellular aspartate and glutamate residues of the ATP-gated rat P 2 X 2 receptor are important for general channel function, pH potentiation, or zinc modulation. All of the extracellular acidic residues tested produced functional channels with only small changes in ATP potency or maximal response. Seven candidates (D 82, E 85, E 91, E 115, D 136, D 209, and D 281) showed significantly reduced zinc potentiation, and one candidate (E 84) showed significantly reduced zinc inhibition. Further tests with cysteine versions of the eight identified candidates and thiol-reactive MTSET suggested that only D 136 remains a good candidate to directly bind zinc at the potentiation site, and there were no good candidates for zinc inhibition. When the 34 alanine substituted mutants were screened for ability to potentiate to acidic pH, E 63 showed significantly reduced pH potentiation as compared with wild type P 2 X 2. Molecular level understanding of the structure-function relationship of allosteric sites of these receptors might allow for development of selective drugs that target allosteric sites, which could lead to safer therapies with fewer side effects than current approaches with neurotransmitter agonists and antagonists...|$|E
40|$|Carbonation, or the {{presence}} of carbon dioxide (CO 2) dissolved in solution, is a commonly encountered feature of beverages in the contemporary human diet. While the popularity of carbonation {{may be attributed to}} its distinct sensory qualities, the specific orosensory pathways mediating CO 2 detection in mammals have not previously been delineated. This dissertation describes the identification of specific cellular and molecular mechanisms that mediate taste sensation of carbonation, using the mouse as a model system. The mammalian gustatory system is sensitive to CO 2, and these responses are sensitive to inhibition of carbonic anhydrases, enzymes that catalyze the interconversion of carbon dioxide with carbonic acid. Through gene expression profiling I discovered that the gene carbonic anhydrase IV (Car 4), encoding an extracellular enzyme, is specifically expressed in acid sensing taste receptor cells (TRCs). Genetic ablation of the Car 4 locus resulted in a major deficit in <b>gustatory</b> CO 2 <b>sensation</b> that is stimulus specific, not affecting responses to acid. Ablation or silencing of acid sensing TRCs likewise produced a profound deficit in taste responses to CO 2. These studies identified a primary pathway of the gustatory carbonation response, substantiating acid sensing TRC and the Car 4 enzyme as key mediators. A smaller gustatory neural response to carbonation remains {{even in the absence of}} sour-sensing TRC and/or Car 4. To identify additional carbonation sensing pathways, I applied an in vivo calcium-imaging assay to define the ensemble of primary gustatory neurons activated by CO 2. These studies revealed that in addition to robust activation of sour sensing neurons, a secondary gustatory pathway for CO 2 detection is mediated by subpopulations of bitter and sweet responsive neurons. I identified carbonic anhydrase VII (Car 7) as an intracellular carbonic anhydrase specifically expressed by sweet, bitter and umami sensing TRC. Pharmacological and gene expression data support a role for Car 7 in transducing the secondary CO 2 sensing pathway. These studies suggested that carbonation acts as a complex gustatory stimulus, stimulating sour, sweet and bitter taste qualities simultaneously. The rules governing peripheral encoding of multi-modal taste stimuli are not well understood. To address this issue, I examined the peripheral gustatory response to binary mixtures of taste qualities. I found that most combinations of taste qualities are represented as a superimposition of the component responses. However, neural responses to attractive stimuli, including natural sugars, artificial sweeteners and umami tastants, are selectively suppressed by simultaneous co-stimulation with a sour (acidic) stimulus. Acid-mediated suppression of sweet is cell autonomous, occurring even in the absence of gustatory acid sensing. Remarkably, carbonation stimulates sour signaling without suppressing sweet taste response. These studies suggest that cross-modal interactions at the periphery modulate the sensory response to complex taste stimuli...|$|R
40|$|Peru und Bolivia {{dispose of}} a unique variety of Capsicum accessions mainly from the species C. baccatum and C. chinense {{that have not been}} {{characterized}} by its biochemical and sensory traits. This research aims to study the relationship between sensory attributes like sweet, sour, and bitter as well as the content of sugars and organic acids obtained by instrumental analysis in Capsicum powders. Prior to the analysis, the capsicum fruits were harvested, solar or oven-dried, milled in their native countries, and then sent to the University of Wuppertal. After a basic and product-specific training, a sensory descriptive Panel of 14 judges was established. 31 native chili powders were analysed in six different product sets by their olfactory (pro- and retronasal), <b>gustatory</b> and trigeminal <b>sensations.</b> The sensory profiling method used was Free Choice Profiling (FCP), in which each assessor created and evaluated its own list of descriptive terms without agreeing in the meaning of the attributes {{with the rest of the}} panel. The sensory data was evaluated by Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA). GPA creates a consensus sample space, in which the highest statistical agreement among the assessors is presented. FCP was a quick and inexpensive method that could be performed with the small available amount of powder. It mainly reveals the interrelationships (similarities and differences) among the samples of each set, and provides a coarse characterization of the samples. Regarding the characterization, the most agreement was observed by the attributes: sweet, bitter, pungent and burning. Besides that, a few olfactory characteristics were able to be interpreted for some sample groups such as acidic, caramel-like, chocolate-like, toasted/smoky, musty and fruity. Due to the drying process, typical odour notes of fresh Capsicum fruits such as fresh, flowerly, and green bell pepper were not observed. Moreover, a rapid instrumental method was developed to simultaneously detect sugar and organic acids. Fructose, glucose, sucrose, citric acid and malic acid were first formed into trimethylsilyl derivates with an oximation and silylation step, and then analysed by gas chromatography (GC) with a flame ionization detector (FID). The total sugar content (sum of fructose, glucose and sucrose) and the total organic acid content (sum of citric acid and malic acid) of 191 native samples (involved in this project) were quantified. Following concentration ranges in Capsicum powders were observed: 0, 6 - 17, 8 g glucose/ 100 g dry weight, 0, 9 - 33, 6 g fructose/ 100 g, 0 - 7, 0 g sucrose/ 100 g, 0, 2 - 8, 3 g citric acid/ 100 g and 0 - 5 g malic acid/ 100 g. It was also possible to show the variability of these analytes in dry material for the species C. baccatum and C. chinense, which have not been investigated yet. With the developed method, the 31 sensory analysed samples were also characterized by their sugar and organic acid contents in order to prove a correlation between the sensory and instrumental data. Two correlation methods were tested: GPA and linear regression. Both methods showed that there is a positive correlation between the attribute sweet and the total sugar content in Capsicum powders. However, there was no correlation between the sourness and the total organic acid content. The attributes pungent and burning also were positively correlated with the total capsaicinoid content. Only the linear regression model revealed that a considerable linear relationship was present in the three cases. As a result, a rough forecast of the sweetness, pungency, and burning sensation with the linear equations based on the instrumental data of new samples, can be generated...|$|R
40|$|The ventroposterior {{medialis}} parvocellularis (VPMpc) {{nucleus of}} the thalamus, the thalamic relay nucleus for <b>gustatory</b> <b>sensation,</b> receives primary input from the parabrachial nucleus, and projects to the insular cortex. To reveal the unique properties of the gustatory thalamus in comparison with archetypical sensory relay nuclei, this study examines the morphology of synaptic circuitry in the VPMpc, focusing on parabrachiothalamic driver input and corticothalamic feedback. Anterogradely visualized parabrachiothalamic fibers in the VPMpc bear large swellings. At electron microscope resolution, parabrachiothalamic axons are myelinated and make large boutons, forming multiple asymmetric, adherent, and perforated synapses onto large‐caliber dendrites and dendrite initial segments. Labeled boutons contain dense‐core vesicles, and they resemble a population of terminals within the VPMpc containing calcitonin gene‐related peptide. As is typical of primary inputs to other thalamic nuclei, parabrachiothalamic terminals are over five times larger than other inputs, while constituting only 2 % of all synapses. Glomeruli and triadic arrangements, characteristic features of other sensory thalamic nuclei, are not encountered. As revealed by anterograde tracer injections into the insular cortex, corticothalamic projections in the VPMpc form a dense network of fine fibers bearing small boutons. Corticothalamic terminals within the VPMpc were also observed to synapse on cells that were retrogradely filled from the same injections. The results constitute an initial survey describing unique anatomical properties of the rodent gustatory thalamus. J. Comp. Neurol. 523 : 139 – 161, 2015. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Using biotinylated tract tracers and light and electron microscopy, the authors provide quantitative ultrastructural characterization of two inputs that arrive to the gustatory thalamic nucleus (ventroposterior medialis parvocellularis nucleus [VPMpc]) : parabrachiothalamic axons that bring the primary input, and corticothalamic axons that provide the feedback input...|$|E
