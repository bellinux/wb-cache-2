Suicidal behavior has been observed in salmonella seeking to overcome competing bacteria by triggering an immune system response against them.

5|$|Ceremonies came to {{surround}} many memorials; many memorials were formally opened or unveiled in public ceremonies, {{while others were}} used for recurring ceremonies on commemorative days. Memorials in Britain and France were typically opened in civic ceremonies involving local dignitaries, veterans and the next-of-kin of fallen servicemen. Some memorials acquired daily ceremonies; in 1928 it became customary to play the Last Post bugle call at the Menin Gate memorial <b>each</b> <b>evening,</b> for example, and this practice spread to many other similar memorials in France.|$|E
5|$|Montville {{suggested}} that Ruth is probably even more popular today {{than he was}} when his career home run record was broken by Aaron. The long ball era that Ruth started continues in baseball, {{to the delight of}} the fans. Owners build ballparks to encourage home runs, which are featured on SportsCenter and Baseball Tonight <b>each</b> <b>evening</b> during the season. The questions of performance-enhancing drug use, which dogged later home run hitters such as McGwire and Bonds, do nothing to diminish Ruth's reputation; his overindulgences with beer and hot dogs seem part of a simpler time.|$|E

That night, Shiloh is {{attacked}} by a German Shepherd Dog while in his makeshift cage and his family discovers Marty has been lying and hiding the dog. After taking the dog to the town doctor, the family must return Shiloh to his rightful owner by Sunday.|$|E

The Times estimated that one year before The Quatermass Experiment was broadcast, in August 1952, the total television audience consisted of about 4 million people. In March of that year, the BBC estimated that an average of 2.25 million people watched BBC programmes <b>each</b> <b>evening.</b>|$|E
5|$|All trucks of the LRDG were {{equipped}} with the Bagnold sun compass and some trucks were also {{equipped with}} a P8 Tank Compass. Each patrol had a navigator who always rode in the second truck in the formation. He was equipped with a theodolite and astronomical position tables with which to plot star sightings, and maps. Watches were used and adjusted <b>each</b> <b>evening</b> using the GMT time check. One major problem faced early on by the LRDG {{was a lack of}} accurate maps for Libya in particular. Patrols had to do their own surveys and make their own maps of each route they took. In July 1941 the Survey Section was formed to carry out this task.|$|E
5|$|<b>Each</b> <b>evening,</b> Texas {{retired from}} her {{bombardment}} position close to Okinawa, but returned {{the next morning}} to resume her bombardments. The enemy ashore, preparing for a defense-in-depth strategy as at Iwo Jima, made no answer. Only air units provided a response, as several kamikaze raids were sent to harass the bombardment group. Texas escaped damage during those attacks. On 1 April, after six days of aerial and naval bombardment, the ground troops went ashore, and for almost two months, Texas remained in Okinawan waters providing gunfire support for the troops and fending off the enemy aerial assault. In performing the latter mission, she claimed one kamikaze kill on her own and claimed three assists. On 14 May she departed Okinawa for the Philippines.|$|E

5|$|Much {{time was}} spent on getting guitars to sound as Simon preferred. A bit of {{experimentation}} among the additional session players occurred, from which Simon would edit himself, compiling them together or often deleting them altogether. Many songs were recorded with a hand-built cigar-box guitar, which Simon bought from Mississippi blues musician Super Chikan. Analogue effects were applied before recording digitally to keep mixes simple; this method also inspired Simon while arranging the songs. Smith would burn Simon a compact disc <b>each</b> <b>evening</b> of the day’s session, and he would return {{the next day with}} notes on the recordings. This resulted in mixes being created as the album developed, rather than {{at the end of the}} process. Simon and Ramone often listened to their recordings while driving around, noting what would need changes.|$|E
5|$|While {{living in}} London, Mr Norrell {{encounters}} Vinculus, a street-magician, who relates a prophecy about a nameless slave and two magicians in England, but Norrell dismisses it. While travelling, Vinculus later meets Jonathan Strange, a young gentleman of property from Shropshire, and recites the same prophecy, which prompts Strange {{to become a}} magician. Meanwhile, the gentleman with thistle-down hair takes a liking to Stephen Black, Sir Walter's butler, and promises {{to make him a}} king. Emma (now Lady Pole) lapses into lassitude. She rarely speaks, and her attempts to communicate her situation are confounded by magic. Without the knowledge of the other characters, <b>each</b> <b>evening</b> she and Stephen are forced to attend balls held by the gentleman with thistle-down hair in the Faerie kingdom of Lost-Hope, where they dance all night long.|$|E
5|$|Internally, {{the ground}} floor of the west wing housed the dining room, service areas and led through to the kitchen and bakehouse. The service area was fitted with a {{mezzanine}} floor to provide sleeping facilities for male servants; the sleeping quarters for female servants were {{on the top floor of}} the mansion to keep the two sexes a good distance away from each other. On the same level, the east wing had a study with ante-room set in the northwest corner, a boudoir, two drawing rooms and a billiard room. An expansive library, divided into sections by pillars, was between the boudoir and study, beside the large bay window. The first floor, accessed via the main staircase positioned within the entrance hall, had all the family bedrooms, and featured balconies. Hip baths were carried to the bedrooms <b>each</b> <b>evening</b> as no bathrooms were incorporated. Cubitt had furniture workshops in London where the majority of the mansion's furnishings and fittings were crafted from mahogany. Nurseries were on the top floor beside the female servant accommodation. Around thirty rooms made up the basement, among them a smoking room where editions of Punch and The Illustrated London News were supplied as reading material. The remaining rooms on the basement level were workshops, wine cellars and individual parlours for the butler, housekeeper and other principal servants, together with general storerooms.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} the number of {{partitions}} of n with alternating sum k such that the multiplicity of each part is bounded by 2 m+ 1 equals the number of partitions of n with k odd parts such that the multiplicity of <b>each</b> <b>even</b> part is bounded by m. The first proof relies on two formulas with two parameters that are related to the four-parameter formulas of Boulet. We also give a combinatorial proof of this result by using Sylvester's bijection, which implies a stronger partition theorem. For m= 0, our result reduces to Bessenrodt's refinement of Euler's Theorem. If the alternating sum and the number of odd parts are not taken into account, we are led to a connection to a generalization of Euler's theorem, which can be deduced from a theorem of Andrews on equivalent upper bound sequences of multiplicities. Analogously, we {{show that the}} number of partitions of n with alternating sum k such that the multiplicity of <b>each</b> <b>even</b> part is bounded by 2 m+ 1 equals the number of partitions of n with k odd parts such that the multiplicity of <b>each</b> <b>even</b> part is also bounded by 2 m+ 1. We provide a combinatorial proof as well. Comment: 15 page...|$|R
