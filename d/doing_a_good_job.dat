5|$|Another {{interviewer}} further {{asked of}} the developers of the removals of other features from previous {{entries in the}} series, including dual screen play, leveling up, Survival mode, Combat mode, and Hard mode. The dual-screen play was removed, with the developers commenting that while {{it could have been}} implemented, it did not need to be, and the full use of the dual screens for viewing intel on units and terrain allowed the gameplay to proceed more seamlessly. The ability to level up players' Commanding Officers was introduced in Days of Ruins predecessor, , the developers commenting that the gameplay centered around how well players used their commanding officer. This mechanic was replaced by the ability to level up individual units, commenting that this mechanic required players to work strategically with how they deploy their units. The Survival and Combat modes were removed due to not fitting with the redesign of the world, preferring to have a more focused game. Finally, Hard mode was removed due to the developers feeling that the Normal mode was designed {{in such a way that}} a widespread audience could enjoy it. They also commented that earning a high ranking in this mode by <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> was effectively the same as Hard mode.|$|E

In 1977, a big stunt scene would have taken us a week to film—it's pretty impressive what they are able to do with computers and effects technology today on a weekly TV show. It gives it a lot more production value and inventiveness than I thought I was going to see when I first heard about the series. I think the show is doing a really good job following the mythology, and Tom is <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> following the tradition.|$|E

Radio {{stations}} around the world paid homage to USA for Africa's creation by simultaneously broadcasting the charity song. In addition to the simulcast, the milestone was marked by {{the release of a}} two-disc DVD called We Are the World: The Story Behind the Song. Ken Kragen asserted that the reason behind the simulcast and DVD release was not for USA for Africa to praise themselves for <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job,</b> but to [...] "use it to do some more good [...] That's all we care about accomplishing."

Towards {{the end of the}} race, Webber was running 2nd behind Lewis Hamilton, with no further pit stops to make, when Sebastian Vettel, driver for sister team Scuderia Toro Rosso, ran into the back of him when Hamilton suddenly reduced his speed in poor visibility and heavy rain under a safety car, taking both cars out of the race. He had been lapping faster than Hamilton due to damage on the McLaren's sidepod from contact with Robert Kubica. Out of the current Formula One drivers, until his win at the 2009 German Grand Prix, Webber has had the second highest number of starts without a win, and {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "unluckiest man in modern Formula One", a title that was reinforced in Japan as Webber started the race suffering from food poisoning and vomited inside his helmet during the first safety car period. When questioned by ITV's Louise Goodman about the race ending collision Webber commented: [...] "Well it's kids, isn't it. Kids with not enough experience, <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> then they fuck it all up," [...] Webber was particularly critical of Hamilton's driving that led to the accident, describing his antics as [...] "shit".

We have 60 episodes and that is probably as many as [...] really needs. It is a standard number for a show like this. I have done a little research and people say it is just crazy doing a series and movie at the same time. I would rather concentrate on <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> on the movie," [...] he noted. He directed the film from a story that he conceived with five other writer-animators from the series: Paul Tibbitt, Derek Drymon, Aaron Springer, Kent Osborne, and Tim Hill. The writers created a mythical hero's quest: the search for a stolen crown, which brings SpongeBob and his best friend Patrick to the surface. In 2003, during the {{production of}} The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, his mentor Jules Engel {{died at the age of}} 94. Hillenburg dedicated the film to his memory.

The group performed the song backed by a troupe of dancers and wore matching black trousers, gold and blue tops with military jackets with ammunition belts. Little Mix's mentor during their time on The X Factor, Tulisa Contostavlos, praised the performance: [...] "You're professional, you're all on point and confident now." [...] Spin South West said that the performance manifested why Little Mix won the competition in 2011.

500|$|Zack's role in Crisis Core has {{received}} a mainly positive reaction. IGN's Ryan Clements particularly praised Zack's relationships with the other main characters. 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish agreed with Clements, arguing that Zack's story contrasted with other RPG plots, calling it [...] "the heart of the game." [...] Kevin VanOrd from GameSpot labelled Zack a [...] "likable and complex hero," [...] arguing that he [...] "transcends the usual spiky-haired heroism and teenage angst with an uncommon maturity that develops as the game continues." [...] GameSpy's Gerald Villoria described Zack as [...] "King of the Nice Guys," [...] noting that even though {{he can be a}} [...] "pretty hate-worthy character if you're the jaded type who mocks the typical Final Fantasy storyline," [...] players who dislike him could come to appreciate him. Zack was also called an [...] "endearing main character" [...] by Game Revolution who stated that despite what the character goes through during the game, he still retains his friendly attitude. Like other reviewers, RPGamer viewed him to have the [...] "full, soulful carriage of a Final Fantasy hero" [...] due to his personal conflicts, despite his [...] "artfully teased hair and devil-may-care grin." [...] Although Eurogamer's Simon Parkin found Zack's physical appearance to be highly similar to Cloud's, he added that [...] "this fan service doesn't put a foot wrong until he reaches into his [...] pocket, pulls out a mobile phone and speaks." [...] He also praised Zack's English voice actor for <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job,</b> noting [...] "his character's maturing and developing over the 15-hour storyline." [...] IGN AU's Patrick Kolan agreed, calling Rick Gomez's work as [...] "pretty likeable." [...] GamesRadar's AJ Glasser commented that the way Zack obtains the Buster Sword and the way he gives it to Cloud is the [...] "ultimate payoff" [...] of Crisis Core, stating that the fact gamers know how the game will end is a serious detraction. When Ayaka finished the song [...] "Why" [...] for Crisis Core, she mentioned that she wanted to deliver it alongside Zack's fate [...] "to the hearts of many people." [...] IGN UK's Dave McCarthy noted how Zack's role in the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII evolved as the series developed, to the point of him getting his own game.|$|E

The Democratic Alliance subsequently filed for a judicial review of the NPA's decision, with party leader Helen Zille stating that Mpshe had [...] "not taken a decision based in law, but [...] buckled to political pressure". The case was set to be heard on 9 June 2009. Whilst Zuma filed his responses timeously, Mpshe delayed the hearing of the matter, requesting two extensions to file the NPA's response. NPA spokesperson Mthunzi Mhaga {{said he could not}} file papers because there were [...] "outstanding matters" [...] to be resolved. Zille, the Democratic Alliance's party head contended that Zuma's response was fundamentally wrong and [...] "devoid of any constitutional basis".
