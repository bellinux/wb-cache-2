30|$|When an <b>alginate</b> <b>dressing</b> {{comes in}} contact with an exuding wound, an ion {{exchange}} reaction takes place. Calcium ions in the <b>alginate</b> <b>dressing</b> are exchanged with sodium ions in the tissue fluid or wound exudates and the dressing swells (Boateng et al. 2008).The moisture level of the wound is kept in control by this gel formed. Alginate gels are able to absorb fluid about 20 times of their weight. This property of alginate gels makes them very desirable as dressing for wounds that contain low to high exudates (Dabiri et al. 2016). Modern wound dressings such as <b>alginate</b> <b>dressing</b> allow wound healing in moist environment (Orive et al. 2002).|$|R
40|$|In chronic wound management, {{alginate}} dressings {{are used}} to absorb exudate and reduce the microbial burden. Silver alginate offers {{the added benefit of}} an additional antimicrobial pressure on contaminating microorganisms. This present study compares the antimicrobial activity of a RESTORE silver <b>alginate</b> <b>dressing</b> with a silver-free control dressing using a combination of in vitro culture and imaging techniques. The wound pathogens examined included Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, β-haemolytic Streptococcus, and strictly anaerobic bacteria. The antimicrobial efficacy of the dressings was assessed using log 10 reduction and 13 -day corrected zone of inhibition (CZOI) time-course assays. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to visualise the relative proportions of live/dead microorganisms sequestered into the dressings over 24 hours and estimate the comparative speed of kill. The RESTORE silver <b>alginate</b> <b>dressing</b> showed significantly greater log 10 reductions and CZOIs for all microorganisms compared with the control, indicating the antimicrobial effect of ionic silver. Antimicrobial activity was evident against all test organisms for up to 5 days and, in some cases, up to 12 days following an on-going microbial challenge. Imaging bacteria sequestered in the silver-free dressing showed that each microbial species aggregated in the dressing and remained viable for more than 20 hours. Growth was not observed inside of the dressing, indicating a possible microbiostatic effect of the alginate fibres. In comparison, organisms in the RESTORE silver <b>alginate</b> <b>dressing</b> were seen to lose viability at a considerably greater rate. After 16 hours of contact with the RESTORE silver <b>alginate</b> <b>dressing,</b> > 90 % of cells of all bacteria and yeast were no longer viable. In conclusion, collectively, the data highlights the rapid speed of kill and antimicrobial suitability of this RESTORE silver <b>alginate</b> <b>dressing</b> on wound isolates and highlights its overwhelming ability to manage a microbial wound bioburden in the management of infected wounds...|$|R
30|$|Alginate {{dressings}} {{are mainly}} {{used to treat}} exudating wounds including infected post-operative wounds and leg ulcers. They {{are available in the}} form of porous sheets formed by freeze drying or fibrous materials intended for packing into wound cavities. When an <b>alginate</b> <b>dressing</b> comes in contact with an exuding wound, an ion exchange reaction takes place. Calcium ions in the <b>alginate</b> <b>dressing</b> are exchanged with sodium ions in the tissue fluid or wound exudates and the dressing swells. The degree of swelling of the dressing depends upon the chemical composition of the dressing and also on its botanical origin (Thomas 2000).

40|$|OBJECTIVES:: To compare {{postoperative}} {{healing of}} split-thickness skin graft (STSG) donor sites using traditional dressings (paraffin gauze) or modern wound dressings (<b>alginate</b> <b>dressing</b> and polyurethane film) in a randomized controlled trial. METHOD:: Thirty patients {{were randomly assigned}} to treatment of an STSG donor site with an <b>alginate</b> <b>dressing</b> and a polyurethane film or nonadherent paraffin gauze. Outcome variables were pain (measured with a visual analog scale), amount of dressing changes, healing time, cosmetic outcome, treatment costs, and overall satisfaction with the procedure. RESULTS:: There {{was no significant difference in}} pain (postoperative day 1 : 2. 1 vs 1. 2, P =. 26; postoperative days 5 - 7 : 1. 0 vs 0. 9, P =. 47; final removal: 1. 9 vs 1. 0, P =. 19) and time to healing (18. 1 vs 15. 4 days, P =. 29) between alginate/polyurethane film dressing and nonadherent paraffin gauze. The semiocclusive dressings with polyurethane film required multiple dressing changes, whereas the nonadherent paraffin gauze could be left in place until complete epithelialization. Treatment costs were substantially lower for paraffin gauze. CONCLUSIONS:: Semiocclusive dressings with alginate dressings and polyurethane film showed no advantages over treatment with paraffin gauze. With lower costs and better patient acceptance, paraffin gauze dressings were the preferred treatment for STSG donor sites...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{effects of}} a {{collagen}} dressing on hard-to-heal venous leg ulcers (VLUs) were evaluated in this prospective, randomised, controlled study. Method: Patients with hard-to-heal VLU were included and {{divided into two groups}} using the block randomisation method. The first group was treated with a collagen and an <b>alginate</b> <b>dressing</b> (group A), and the second group with an <b>alginate</b> <b>dressing</b> alone (group B). Both groups also had a short-stretch compression system applied at every dressing change. The dressings were changed twice a week for 12 weeks or until the ulcer was healed. Granulation tissue improvement, wound size, overall dressing performance and dressing comfort were evaluated and recorded. Results: A total of 40 patients completed the study evaluation period. Group A had a 65 % increase in granulation tissue compared to 38 % in group B. The mean ulcer area was reduced to 45 % in group A compared to 20 % in group B at 12 weeks. No significant side effects were detected in either group. Patients of both groups were satisfied with their treatment and healing progress. Conclusion: The results of this study showed the effectiveness and safety of a collagen dressing in hard-to-heal VLUs as an adjunctive therapy with compression bandaging.

40|$|Abstract. Aggregation problem {{limits the}} use of silver {{nanoparticles}} (nano-Ag). Liquid chemical reduction method was used to fabricate silver/hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (nano-Ag/HA) by depositing nano-Ag {{on the surface of}} hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (nano-HA). The XRD result shows nano-Ag/HA is a hybrid composite of hydroxyapatite and face-centered cubic crystalline silver. The TEM result confirms the size and distribution of nano-Ag are dependent on the mass ratio of deposited nano-Ag and nano-HA, decreasing the mass ratio can obtain nano-Ag with smaller size and less particle aggregation, which can be contributed to the heterogeneous nucleation effect of nano-HA on nano-Ag. Silver/hydroxyapatite/alginate composite dressing was fabricated by spraying nano-Ag/HA onto the surface of the <b>alginate</b> <b>dressing.</b> The test result of disc diffusion method shows the evident antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli (E. coli) is assigned to nano-Ag/HA, no significant difference can be found between the dressings with 0. 01 g and 0. 02 g nano-Ag...|$|R
40|$|Background: Split-thickness skin graft (STSG) donor sites {{sometimes}} {{cause more}} postoperative morbidity for patients than the wound {{covered with the}} graft. Yet, {{there is no consensus}} on which dressings are best suited to treat these donor sites. Objective: To evaluate two commonly used modern wound dressings in the postoperative healing of STSG donor sites in a prospective randomized controlled trial. Methods: 38 patients were randomly assigned to treatment of an STSG donor site with an <b>alginate</b> <b>dressing</b> or a polyurethane film dressing. The primary outcome measures were postoperative pain scores, secondary outcome variables were time to epithelialization, dressing changes and complications. Results: Postoperative pain on day 1 was significantly lower in the polyurethane film group (2. 05 vs. 0. 79, p = 0. 035) as compared to the alginate group. This difference was not detected on day 5 (0. 89 vs. 0. 53, p = 0. 52). Time to epithelialization did not differ significantly between the two dressing groups. There were more dressing changes in the polyurethane film group and problems with leakage. Conclusion: Whereas film dressings resulted in initially lower pain scores, alginate dressings caused fewer additional dressing changes and less leakage. © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the clinical therapeutic effect of the combined application of alginate and recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) on the healing of refractory chronic skin ulcers. A single center, three arm, randomized study was performed at Jinan Central Hospital (Jinan, Shandong, China). A total of 60 patients with refrac-tory chronic skin ulcers, which persisted for> 1 month, were enrolled and randomly assigned into one of the following three groups: alginate dressing/rhGM-CSF group (group A), rhGM-CSF only group (group B) and conventional (vaseline dressing) group (group C). The wound area rate was measured, granulation and color were observed and pain was evalu-ated. The data were summarized and statistical analysis was performed. The results demonstrated that group A exhibited a significantly faster wound healing rate and lower pain score compared with the other groups (P< 0. 01). In conclusion, the combined application of <b>alginate</b> <b>dressing</b> and rhGM-CSF for the treatment of refractory chronic skin ulcers demonstrated significant advantages. It promoted the growth of granulation tissue, accelerated re-epithelialization and also effectively reduced wound pain, and thus improved the quality of life for the patient.

40|$|Sickle-cell {{disease is}} the most {{prevalent}} genetic disease in the Brazilian population. Lower limb ulcers are the most frequent cutaneous complications, affecting 8 % to 10 % of the patients. These ulcers are usually deep and may take many years to heal. Evidence {{about the effectiveness of}} systemic or topical treatment of these wounds is limited, apart from stabilization of the anemia. A 28 -year old woman with sickle-cell disease was admitted for treatment of three deep chronic lower leg ulcers. All wounds had tendon exposure and contained firmly adherent fibrin slough. Following surgical debridement and before grafting, the wounds were managed with three different dressings: a rayon and normal saline solution <b>dressing,</b> a calcium <b>alginate</b> <b>dressing</b> covered with gauze, and negative pressure therapy. All three wounds healed successfully and their grafts showed complete integration; only the rayon-dressed wound required a second debridement. The alginate and rayon-dressed wounds recurred after 9 months and required additional skin grafts. Helpful research on managing ulcers in patients with sickle-cell disease is minimal, but the results of this case study suggest that topical treatment modalities may affect outcomes.

By way of an investigator initiated clinical trial, {{we tested the}} hypothesis that a silver-eluting <b>alginate</b> topical surgical <b>dressing</b> would lower wound complication rates in patients undergoing open arterial procedures in the lower extremity. MethodsThe study block-randomized 500 patients at three institutions to standard gauze or silver alginate dressings placed over incisions after leg arterial surgery. This original operating room dressing remained until gross soiling, clinical need to remove, or postoperative day 3, whichever was first. Subsequent care was at the provider's discretion. The primary end point was 30 -day wound complication incidence generally based on National Surgical Quality Improvement Program guidelines. Demographic, clinical, quality of life, and economic end points were also collected. Wound closure was at the surgeon's discretion. ResultsParticipants (72 % male) were 84 % white, 45 % were diabetic, 41 % had critical limb ischemia, and 32 % had claudication (with aneurysm, bypass revision, other). The overall 30 -day wound complication incidence was 30 %, with superficial surgical site infection as the most common. In intent-to-treat analysis, silver alginate {{had no effect on}} wound complications. Multivariable analysis showed that Coumadin (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ; odds ratio [OR], 1. 72; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 03 - 2. 87; P =. 03), higher body mass index (OR, 1. 05; 95 % CI, 1. 01 - 1. 09; P =. 01), and the use of no conduit/material (OR, 0. 12; 95 % CI, 0. 82 - 3. 59; P <. 001) were independently associated with wound complications.

In the first trial (77 patients), wounds were treated with a calcium <b>alginate</b> <b>dressing</b> (Algisite M). In the second trial (77 patients), wounds were treated with a hydrofibre dressing (Aquacel). In the Algisite M trial, complete closure of wounds was reported in 23 / 77 (30 %) patients, a further 15 / 77 (19 %) patients had wounds that had almost healed, and 23 / 77 (30 %) patients had granulating wounds. Overall, improvement in wounds was observed for 82 % of patients. A very positive, or positive clinician judgement on Algisite M was obtained for 74 / 77 (96 %) patients. In the Aquacel trial, 14 / 77 (18 %) patients had complete healing of wounds, 5 / 77 (6 %) patients had wounds that had almost healed, and 9 / 77 (12 %) patients had granulating wounds.

There was no statistical {{difference between the two groups}} in numbers healed (17 per group). There was a difference in the mean wear time (mean hydrofiber group, 3. 63 days; mean alginate group, 3. 27 days; p < 0. 001). Cost per healed ulcer, including nurse time, resulted in costs of £ 1184. 09 ($ 1700. 02) for the hydrofiber and £ 1200. 73 ($ 1723. 69) for the alginate. In terms of 10 -percentage point reduction in ulcer area, the costs of the hydrofiber was £ 80. 15 ($ 115. 06) and the cost of the alginate was £ 104. 92 ($ 150. 62).

40|$|Introduction Thermography is {{a surface}} thermal {{radiation}} measurement technique whose application has been expanding {{in the healthcare}} field. The unhealed wound is a serious public health problem because it intervenes {{in the quality of}} life of patients and may cause emotional and psychological losses. The wound temperature can provide quantitative data that allow for the healing process to be monitored. The aim of this study was to verify whether thermography can be used as a method to evaluate the healing of pressure ulcers. Methods Eight participants with sacral pressure ulcers were recruited and randomly divided into two groups: A (control) and B (experimental). Both groups received standard treatment for a period of four weeks, which consisted of a daily cleaning of the pressure ulcers with physiological saline (sodium chloride 0. 9 %) followed by an <b>alginate</b> hydrogel <b>dressing.</b> The group B received light-emitting diode (LED) phototherapy in addition to standard treatment, three times a week, yielding a total of 12 sessions. Photographs and thermograms of each pressure ulcer were obtained in all sessions in both groups. Results Pressure ulcers treated with LED phototherapy were healed. The pressure ulcer area of group B decreased over the 12 treatment sessions, whereas the pressure ulcer area of group A increased. The ulcer temperature of group B was higher than that of group A during the treatment (temperature difference up to 7. 6 %).

40|$|Burn {{wound healing}} {{involves}} {{a complex set}} of overlapping processes in an environment conducive to ischemia, inflammation, and infection costing $ 7. 5 billion/year in the US alone, in addition to the morbidity and mortality that occur when the burns are extensive. We previously showed that insulin, when topically applied to skin excision wounds, accelerates re-epithelialization, and stimulates angiogenesis. More recently, we developed an <b>alginate</b> sponge <b>dressing</b> (ASD) containing insulin encapsulated in PLGA microparticles that provides a sustained release of bioactive insulin for > 20 days in a moist and protective environment. We hypothesized that insulin-containing ASD accelerates burn healing and stimulates a more regenerative, less scarring, healing. Using a heat-induced burn injury in rats, we show that burns treated with dressings containing 0. 04 mg insulin/cm 2, every three days for 9 days, have faster closure, faster rate of disintegration of dead tissue, and decreased oxidative stress. In addition, in insulin-treated wounds the pattern of neutrophil inflammatory response suggests faster clearing of the burn dead tissue. We also observe faster resolution of the pro-inflammatory macrophages. We also found that insulin stimulates collagen deposition and maturation with the fibers organized more like a basket weave (normal skin) than aligned and crosslinked (scar tissue). In summary, application of ASD-containing insulin-loaded PLGA particles on burns every three days stimulates faster and more regenerative healing. These results suggest insulin as a potential therapeutic agent in burn healing and, because of its long history of safe use in humans, insulin could become one of the treatments of choice when repair and regeneration are critical for proper tissue function.

40|$|Abstract Background: Surgical site {{infection}} (SSI) in {{the groin}} after vascular surgery is common and deep perivascular infection leads to long periods of hospitalization, sometimes to amputation and/or death. Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is increasingly used for treating wounds such as deep perivascular groin infections after vascular surgery, {{but there is no}} scientific evidence supporting its benefit over traditional wound therapy. Aims: To study the effect of NPWT on wound healing, complications, resource use, quality of life, cost-effectiveness, and to explore the experiences of patients with deep perivascular groin infections after vascular surgery undergoing NPWT at home Methods: A retrospective study was performed on consecutive patients undergoing NPWT between 2004 and 2006, and a randomized controlled trial was conducted between 2007 and 2011, where patients undergoing NPWT were compared to those treated with a traditional <b>alginate</b> <b>dressing.</b> Finally, a qualitative interview study was conducted between 2013 and 2014, in which patients undergoing NPWT in the outpatient setting were interviewed 7 - 14 days after discharge. Results: Twenty-eight patients/ 33 groins were studied in Study I, ten patients in each group in Studies II & III and 15 patients in Study IV. The median wound healing time was 55 days in Study I, 57 days in the NPWT group compared to 104 in the alginate group (p= 0. 026) in Studies II & III and 58 days in Study IV. The graft preservation rate in NPWT patients was 83 %, 86 % and 85 % in Studies I, II/III and IV, respectively. Bacterial clearance from the wound was the same in the NPWT and alginate group in Studies II &III. One patient in the NPWT and one in the alginate group in Studies II &III had a severe bleeding from the femoral artery reconstruction site. Nine (43 %) out of 21 groins with synthetic graft infections in Study I had an infection-related complication, compared to 0 (0 %) out of 12 groins in those that did not have a synthetic graft infection (p= 0. 012), and non-healing wounds were associated with amputation (p= 0. 005) and death (p< 0. 001). A median of 21 (IQR 15 - 30) dressing changes were performed in the NPWT group, compared to 73 (IQR 51 - 98) (p< 0. 001) in the alginate group in Studies II & III. Compared to alginate therapy, NPWT saved the nurses 4. 5 hours of work the first week after surgical revision in Study III. The total costs for the NPWT and alginate group in Study III were the same, of which 87 % and 83 %, respectively, were attributed to in-hospital costs. In Study III, estimation of Euroqol 5 Dimensions instrument and Brief Pain Inventory showed no differences at respective time points between the two groups. In Study IV an overall theme emerged from the descriptions of the experiences of patients with deep perivascular groin infection after vascular surgery undergoing NPWT at home, namely that it meant a transition from being a dependent patient to a person who needs to be involved and have self-care competence. A need to feel prepared for this before discharge from hospital was expressed. Lack of information and feelings of uncertainty prolonged the time before feeling confident in managing the treatment. The informants gradually accepted the need to be tied to a machine, became competent in its management, and found solutions to perform everyday tasks. Overall, {{it was a relief to}} be treated at home. Conclusion: NPWT in patients with deep perivascular SSI after vascular surgery is superior to traditional alginate therapy in terms of wound healing and cost-effectiveness. Patients expressed several benefits of treatment with NPWT at home. However, they experienced unnecessary stress and anxiety due to lack of information on the treatment and instruction concerning the equipment. Therefore, adequate information and education must be provided...|$|R

In general, {{no statistically significant differences}} in wound healing were found for various dressing comparisons (11 of 13 trials).

Gauze was inexpensive, but its use was associated with significantly more nursing time than dressing with foam (two of three trials). No substantial differences in hospital stay were found (four of five trials). Conclusions: Only small, poor-quality trials exist, rendering the evidence insufficient. Foam is best studied as an alternative to gauze and appears to be preferable in terms of pain reduction, patient satisfaction and nursing tim...|$|R
40|$|An open {{randomised}} prospectively controlled {{trial was}} performed to assess the healing efficacy, slippage rate and degree of discomfort on removal of calcium alginate and a silicone-coated polyamide net dressing on split skin graft donor sites. Sixteen patients were randomised to the calcium alginate group and 14 to the silicone-coated group. The donor sites were assessed at days 7, 10, 14 and up to day 21. The mean time to healing in the calcium alginate group was 8. 75 +/- 0. 78 days (range 7 to 14 days) compared to 12 +/- 0. 62 days (range 7 to 16 days) for the silicone-coated group (p < 0. 01). Although more silicone-coated dressings slipped (5 versus 1), {{the difference was not}} statistically significant. Pain during the first dressing change was assessed using a visual analogue pain scale. Although {{no significant differences were found}} between the groups, it was necessary to change the dressing protocol in the silicone-coated arm of the trial after entering the first two patients. Overlaid absorbent gauze adhered to the donor site through the fenestrations in the dressing necessitating the placement of paraffin gauze between the experimental dressing and the overlying cotton gauze. There was one infection in the study, occurring in the alginate group. Based on these results we recommend calcium <b>alginate</b> as the <b>dressing</b> of choice for split skin graft donor sites...|$|R
