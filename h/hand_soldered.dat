50|$|Tube sockets were {{typically}} mounted in holes {{on a sheet}} metal chassis and wires or other components were <b>hand</b> <b>soldered</b> to lugs {{on the underside of}} the socket. In the 1950s, printed circuit boards were introduced and tube sockets were developed whose contacts could be soldered directly to the printed wiring tracks. Looking at the bottom of a socket, or, equivalently, a tube from its bottom, the pins were numbered clockwise, starting at an index notch or gap, a convention that has persisted into the integrated circuit era.|$|E
50|$|Solder mask or solder stop mask or {{solder resist}} {{is a thin}} lacquer-like layer of polymer that is usually applied to the copper traces of {{a printed circuit board}} (PCB) for {{protection}} against oxidation and to prevent solder bridges from forming between closely spaced solder pads. A solder bridge is an unintended electrical connection between two conductors by means of a small blob of solder. PCBs use solder masks to prevent this from happening. Solder mask is not always used for <b>hand</b> <b>soldered</b> assemblies, but is essential for mass-produced boards that are soldered automatically using reflow or solder bath techniques. Once applied, openings must be made in the solder mask wherever components are soldered, which is accomplished using photolithography. Solder mask is traditionally green but is now available in many colors.|$|E

40|$|The role of {{contacts}} in characterization of traps in semi-insulating (SI) GaAs by {{thermally stimulated current}} (TSC) methods has been demonstrated by comparing alloyed In and soldered In contacts. Alloyed In contacts, which have an ohmic characteristic, assure high sensitivities in both TSC and temperature dependent photocurrent (PC), and both are important for determining the trap concentrations in SI GaAs. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>soldered</b> In contacts, which act like Schottky barriers, cause a significant reduction of both PC and TSC, particularly at low temperatures, {{and can lead to}} a misinterpretation of TSC results...|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to using traditional bars or coiled wires of all-metal solder and manually applying flux {{to the parts}} being joined, much <b>hand</b> <b>soldering</b> since the mid-20th century has used flux-core solder.

40|$|The {{assembly}} of sealed hollow rotors, {{a key component}} in achieving liquid-levitated micro-gyroscopes, represents a significant challenge. The rotor is a thin-wall cylinder composed of materials that are only 100 -μm thick. Furnace <b>soldering</b> and <b>hand</b> <b>soldering</b> are used to join the work pieces, but produce defects evident from deformations and surface roughness. Modeling and experiments show that the deformation {{is related to the}} temperature during assembly and the mode by which heat is applied to the components. Temperature affects the deformation through thermal stress and air pressure on the rotor, but the mode of heating creates a big difference. Surface deformation of the rotor alters the detecting capacitance and introduces uncertainty in detection sensitivity of the gyroscope. Experiments show that at 220 °C, furnace soldering of rotors causes a great decrease in detection sensitivity, leading to a relative uncertainty of nearly 40 %. In contrast, <b>hand</b> <b>soldering</b> leads to a relative uncertainty of about 5 %. Spot heating of the rotor during assembly is much better than total heating as less thermal stress is generated and the air pressure difference is almost eliminated. Lowering the temperature is helpful to as long as the connection is sufficiently strengthened...|$|R
50|$|For <b>hand</b> <b>soldering,</b> {{the heat}} source tool should be {{selected}} {{to provide adequate}} heat for the size of joint to be completed. A 100 watt soldering iron may provide too much heat for printed circuit boards, while a 25 watt iron will not provide enough heat for large electrical connectors, joining copper roof flashing, or large stained-glass lead came. Using a tool with too high a temperature can damage sensitive components, but protracted heating by a tool that is too cool or under powered can also cause heat damage, perhaps even detaching PCB traces from the substrate.|$|R

5000|$|A typical pad on {{a printed}} circuit board is only {{connected}} to a few narrow tracks. A pad directly connected to the copper pour is difficult to solder since the heat quickly leaks away from the pad into the copper pour due to high thermal conductivity of copper. A thermal connection restricts the heat flow, making the pad easier to solder.Via holes that only connect one layer to another, without having soldering wires or pins into the hole, do not normally need thermal restriction.Wire leaded components that are either carrying radio frequency currents, where the additional inductance would be problematic, or where very high current densities are expected, and the spokes of the thermal relief may act as a fuse, may require the thermal relief pattern to be customised or even omitted, in which case the parts may require additional <b>hand</b> <b>soldering</b> during assembly.|$|R
5000|$|Soldering {{operations}} can {{be performed}} with hand tools, one joint at a time, or en masse on a production line. <b>Hand</b> <b>soldering</b> is typically performed with a soldering iron, soldering gun, or a torch, or occasionally a hot-air pencil. Sheetmetal work was traditionally done with [...] "soldering coppers" [...] directly heated by a flame, with sufficient stored heat in {{the mass of the}} soldering copper to complete a joint; gas torches (eg, butane or propane) or electrically-heated soldering irons are more convenient. All soldered joints require the same elements of cleaning of the metal parts to be joined, fitting up the joint, heating the parts, applying flux, applying the filler, removing heat and holding the assembly still until the filler metal has completely solidified. Depending on the nature of flux material used and the application, cleaning of the joint may be required after it has cooled.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} defect when hand-soldering {{results from the}} parts being joined not {{exceeding}} the solder's liquidus temperature, resulting in a [...] "cold solder" [...] joint.

Properly done, the iron heats the parts to be connected, which in turn melt the solder, guaranteeing adequate heat in the joined parts for thorough wetting. In electronic <b>hand</b> <b>soldering</b> the flux is embedded in the solder. Therefore, heating the solder first may cause the flux to evaporate before it cleans the surfaces being soldered.

Cold-soldered joints also happen in mass production, and are a common cause of equipment which passes testing, but malfunctions after sometimes years of operation.

40|$|The LION Navigator, as a {{standard}} product line of Airbus Defence and Space, has started a design for manufacturing initiative for switched mode power supplies in the year 2010.

40|$|<b>Hand</b> <b>soldering</b> using rosin core solder wire {{is common}} in the {{electronics}} industry and several studies have implicated the aerosol produced when rosin flux is heated in causing respiratory sensitisation. Control of solder fume is generally achieved using local exhaust hoods, simple blowers with a filter or low-volume high-velocity (LVHV) ventilation systems. None of these provide an ideal control system and so a push-pull ventilation design was developed as an alternative. Laboratory tests of the system's capture efficiency were carried out using nitrous oxide tracer gas. Capture efficiency was generally greater than 90 % with the push airflow operating. However, without the push airflow, capture efficiency decreased sharply with increasing distance from the exhaust hood (between 38 and 58 % at 420 mm {{from the front of}} the exhaust hood with the same exhaust airflow used by the push-pull system). The push-pull system was found to be relatively insensitive to obstructions placed in the path of the air flow or the influence of cross draughts.

40|$|Considerable {{interest}} {{exists in}} the process known as the pin-in-paste, or the Alternative Assembly and Reflow Technology (AART) process. The AART process allows for the simultaneous reflow of both odd-form and through hole devices as well as surface mount components. This process has several advantages over the typical mixed technology process sequence that includes wave <b>soldering</b> and/or <b>hand</b> <b>soldering,</b> often in addition to reflow soldering. The advantages include, {{but are not limited}} to, the following: multiple operations can be condensed into one comprehensive process; fewer pieces of equipment, materials, and personnel are necessary; a reduction in cost and cycle time can be realized; the high defect rate associated with wave soldering may be reduced; and it eliminates one or more thermal process steps thereby improving solderability, electronic component reliability, etc. Numerous issues must be considered before implementing a high-yield AART process. A high-yield process requires a scientific understanding and a systematic examination of materials, design, and process related factors on proper interconnection formation and assembly reliability. For example, solder paste selection and component resin choice are important material characteristics. Component body design and stencil aperture design are critical parameters in the design area. Finally, the reflow profile and the placement method are important process parameters that must be understood and controlled. Many important aspects and issues for a successful AART process have been identified and examined in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} five years, the {{electronic}} assembly industry has been examining a variety of alloy systems as lead-free alternatives for the conventional 63 Sn/ 37 Pb eutectic system. Many of the proposed systems are quite interesting from a technical standpoint, but fall short when considering practical issues such as cost, availability, and repeatability of manufacture. The intent {{of this paper is}} to provide the industry with a practical, and technically feasible, lead-free process that can be implemented or used as a baseline to compare other more complex systems. The benchmark process consists of: 1) PCB’s with a very thin metallized silver coating on the pads (rather than the Sn/Pb hot air solder leveled pads-HASL, 2) 96. 5 Sn/ 3. 5 Ag and 95. 5 Sn/ 4. 0 Ag/ 0. 5 Cu eutectic and near eutectic alloy systems for solder paste applications; 3) 99. 3 Sn/ 0. 7 Cu eutectic alloy system for wave soldering applications; and 4) 99. 3 Sn/ 0. 7 Cu alloy for <b>hand</b> <b>soldering</b> applications. Although this approach represents a practical, feasible process, there are a few significant issues associated with implementation of a lead-free process. The costs of the materials are still higher than the standard Sn/Pb process, there are increased limits on the degree of wetting, the process requires an inert atmosphere in the wave soldering process (nitrogen at the wave is sufficient), and it pushes the reflo...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this bachelor thesis is to construct something interesting to be displayed at student recruitment fairs all around Sweden, to increase the interest in applying for education in electronics. The thesis consists of two parts, constructing two circuit boards. The first one is the main board that will be mounted on a small motor vehicle. The second one is the controller to steer the motor vehicle. The main board will be equipped with electronic components to communicate with a computer as well as photo detectors {{to communicate with the}} controller. Communication between the main board and the controller is transferred via infrared light. Both parts were simulated until the results matched the given specifications. The two circuits were then transferred to Eagle to make PCB layouts. The main board was ordered from Cogra and the controller etched by hand. Components were added to the main board by means of solder paste and fixated trough a reflow oven. Some components were added via <b>hand</b> <b>soldering</b> as were all components on the controller board. The cards were then tested to see how well the main board amplified the signal, from the controller, and where, on the frequency spectrum, the main board had the highest gain.

40|$|Electroluminescent (EL) wire is {{a unique}} kind of wire because it glows when {{attached}} to a power source. EL wire has many applications, both creative and practical. For example: Burning Man enthusiasts like to adorn their clothing with the flexible wire, and emergency responders use it to mark off accidents on the road at night. What makes EL wire glow is the electrical reactions between its copper wires and phosphor coating. The problem with this wire, however, {{is that it is}} very difficult to connect it to a battery. This is due to the wire’s structure. Beneath its protective plastic shielding, EL wire has a core copper wire, double wrapped with a very fine pair of copper wires. These fine copper wires are hard to solder to, and can break without much effort. Standard soldering methods use a basic alligator tooth style double clamp to hold EL wires in place for soldering. This device is very poorly made, as one must tighten and re-tighten every moveable joint for a precision solder. Adjusting these clamps can be maddening, especially when many EL solder joints must be made. There must be a better way to terminate EL wire, therefore various connection methods are considered as possible solutions. They are: improved <b>hand</b> <b>soldering,</b> machine soldering, conducive epoxy, and crimping. Ultimately it was decided that an improved solder technique would prove to be the best solution. And it entailed manufacturing a custom fixture that would hold the EL wire for easy soldering. The design went though many phases and was tested to see if it commanded a faster soldering time over its clamping counterpart. The results suggest the fixture has a mean soldering time that is statistically significantly less than the mean soldering time of the alligator clamps, with ninety-five percent confidence. An economic analysis determined that if even just one electrician were to try to profit off of making EL wire assemblies, working either full-time or part-time, he or she would save money in labor hours by purchasing the fixture. A hobbyist on the other hand, who makes only a few EL wire assemblies a month, might be stretching his or her wallet too far by spend the money for the fixture. The bottom line is that if someone stands to make a profit off EL wire assemblies, or is serious about making all kinds of EL artwork, this fixture will save the user time...|$|R
40|$|A flight {{printed wiring}} board (PWB) for a {{satellite}} project was observed {{to have a high}} incidence of measling. Other PWB's produced for the program by the same manufacturer did not exhibit the degree of measling as did the 'measle-prone' board. Measling susceptibility during <b>hand</b> <b>soldering</b> and measling effects on PWB insulation resistance were investigated for three production PWB's. Measling resistance was significantly different between the three boards: the 'worst' exhibited five times the number of measles as the 'best' board. 'Severe' measling (that which is likely to affect board reliability) did not exist on the 'best' board, even under extreme soldering conditions (399 degrees C for 12 - 15 sec.), whereas the 'worst' board showed an average of one 'severe' measle for every two pads under more normal soldering conditions (288 - 343 degrees C for 2 - 5 sec.). Both soldering time and temperature affected measling, with time having a slightly greater influence (2 percent versus 12 percent). Measling effects on PWB insulation resistance were inconclusive. These were evaluated by in situ resistance measurements on the same three boards at elevated temperature and humidity. The measured resistance for all three boards decreased for exposures greater than 50 degrees C and 50 percent relative humidity. The 'measle-prone' board showed a resistance decrease at only 25 degrees C and 50 percent relative humidity. However, no definitive difference was detected between measled and not-measled (control) samples. The boards evaluated were production boards, so the effect of interlayer traces connecting the plated-through holes was not controlled. It is likely the resistance measurements were over different volumes of PWB laminate, which would account for the widely varying resistances measured. Thermomechanical measurements on board laminate materials did not reveal any differences attributed to measling. Differences in glass transition temperature were significantly different when measured by DTA, but not by SDT.

40|$|The SA 1358 - 10 and SA 2052 - 4 {{circular}} JT Type plug connectors {{are used}} {{on a number of}} nuclear weapons and Joint Test Assembly (JTA) systems. Prototype units were evaluated for the following specific defects associated with the 95 Sn- 5 Sb (Sn-Sb, wt. %) solder joint used to attach the beryllium-copper (BeCu) spring fingers to the aluminum (Al) connector shell: (1) extended cracking within the fillet; (2) remelting of the solder joint during the follow-on, soldering step that attached the EMR adapter ring to the connector shell (and/or soldering the EMR shell to the adapter ring) that used the lower melting temperature 63 Sn- 37 Pb (Sn-Pb) alloy; and (3) spalling of the Cd (Cr) layer overplating layer from the fillet surface. Several pedigrees of connectors were evaluated, which represented older fielded units as well as those assemblies that were recently constructed at Kansas City Plant. The solder joints were evaluated that were in place on connectors made with the current soldering process as well as an alternative induction soldering process for attaching the EMR adapter ring to the shell. Very similar observations were made, which crossed the different pedigrees of parts and processes. The extent of cracking in the top side fillets varied between the different connector samples and likely the EMR adapter ring to the shell. Very similar observations were made, which crossed the different pedigrees of parts and processes. The extent of cracking in the top side fillets varied between the different connector samples and likely reflected the different extents to which the connector was mated to its counterpart assembly. In all cases, the spring finger solder joints on the SA 1358 - 10 connectors were remelted {{as a result of the}} subsequent EMR adapter ring attachment process. Spalling of the Cd (Cr) overplating layer was also observed for these connectors, which was a consequence of the remelting activity. On the other hand, the SA 2052 - 4 connector did not exhibit evidence of remelting of the spring finger solder joint. The Cd (Cr) layer did not show signs of spalling. These results suggested that, due to the size of the SA 1358 - 10 connector, any of the former or current soldering processes used to attach the EMR adapter ring and/or EMR shell to the connector shell, requires a level of heat energy that will always result in the remelting of the spring finger solder joint attached with either the Sn-Ag or the Sn-Sb alloy. Lastly, it was construed that the induction soldering process, which is used to attach the EMR adapter ring onto the shell, was more likely to have caused the remelting event rather than the more localized heat source of the <b>hand</b> <b>soldering</b> iron used to attach the EMR shell to the adapter ring...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to design a small profile, low-power, high {{performance}} printed circuit board (PCB) with support for high speed peripherals, while relying on the equipment and facilities of NTNU as much as possible. The intended usage of this module is in image processing applications for autonomous vehicles. The accomplishment of this goal encompasses gaining experience within proficient usage of computer aided design (CAD) tools, implementation of high speed design theory, fabrication of a multilayer PCB, and assembly of advanced components with small footprints and high pin densities, such as ball grid arrays (BGA) and quad flat no leads (QFN) packages. In addition, validation of functionality and testing is {{also a part of}} the process. There are several reasons for why such a project is important, and the benefits of carrying out such a project can be leveraged in several areas. First of all, it is desirable to get an overview of the production limitations at the NTNU campus. Where does the limit go for how advanced designs we can produce? What is not possible to do at the NTNU campus? How far can we push our capabilities? Then there is the desire of setting precedence within advanced PCB design and production, in order to build competence at the University that the students and researchers can benefit from in the future. All for the purpose of increasing the quality of their education. Furthermore, low power image processing capabilities with support for high speed peripherals are highly desirable in autonomous vehicles and increase the potential for future research. In order to achieve the goals set for this project, one needs to gain an understanding of what the various components require in terms of design and assembly, and an overview needs to be worked out in order to see how much of these requirements can be met at campus. The process started at finding the correct CAD tool. An attempt was made at using the OrCAD package which The Department of Cybernetics had licenses for. It was discovered that the OrCAD licenses we were in possession of were not suited for the requirements of high-speed bus design. Therefore, an Altium Designer license was borrowed from The Department of Electronics and Telecommunication (IET). Extensive research was done to acquire knowledge about high-speed bus design, which resulted in successful DDR 2, Ethernet, and USB bus implementations. The finished design was given the name textit{KybMo}. The workshop at The Department of Engineering cybernetics is in possession of a milling machine for PCB fabrication. However, this machine can only accommodate fabrication of two layer boards, and not 8 layers, as the design required. Thus the fabrication of the board had to be outsourced to an external manufacturer. The department of Engineering Cybernetics recently acquired a re-flow oven that can accommodate assembly of surface mount components such as BGAs and QFNs, but the oven had never been used before, so no one possessed any experience on how to operate it. Gaining this experience was therefore important and the oven was used with successful results. <b>Hand</b> <b>soldering</b> of extremely small discrete components on the bottom side of the board was carried out, as well as successful testing of alternative methods such as using a heating plate and a heat gun with extremely low air pressure in order to avoid blowing the components away. Software packages including stand alone examples, and a Linux system configured for reference designs based on the same System on Chip (SoC) utilized by the KybMo, the OMAP-L 138, were modified to fit the configuration of the KybMo and was used for validation of functionality. The project resulted in successful fabrication and assembly of a small, low-power, high performance 8 layer PCB, with over two hundred components. All of the high speed buses were validated and the system was successfully able to boot Linux. This proves that it is definitely possible to design and assemble systems of industrial complexity at the NTNU campus. However, the cost was more than expected. In order for student projects such as this one to be economically supported by the Department, an effort has to be made to push the limits of the design so that less than eight PCB layers are required. Otherwise, an attempt at acquiring external sponsorship is instrumental. </p...|$|R
