5|$|According to {{the authors}} of the 2011 genetic study, the close {{relation}} between the King Island and mainland emus indicates that the former population was isolated from the latter relatively recently, due to sea level changes in the Bass Strait, as opposed to a founding <b>emu</b> lineage that diverged from the mainland <b>emu</b> far earlier and had subsequently gone extinct on the mainland. Models of sea level change indicate that Tasmania, including King Island, was isolated from the Australian mainland around 14,000 years ago. Up to several thousand years later King Island was then separated from Tasmania. This scenario would suggest that a population ancestral to both the King Island and Tasmanian <b>emu</b> was initially isolated from the mainland taxon, after which the King Island and Tasmanian populations were separated. This in turn indicates that the likewise extinct Tasmanian <b>emu</b> is probably as closely related to the mainland <b>emu</b> as is the King Island <b>emu,</b> with both the King Island and Tasmanian <b>emu</b> being more closely related to each other. Fossil <b>emu</b> taxa show an average size between that of the King Island <b>emu</b> and mainland <b>emu.</b> Hence, mainland emus can be regarded as a large or gigantic form.|$|E
5|$|The King Island <b>emu</b> (Dromaius novaehollandiae minor) is an extinct {{subspecies}} of <b>emu</b> {{that was}} endemic to King Island, which {{is situated in}} the Bass Strait between mainland Australia and Tasmania. Its closest relative may be the extinct Tasmanian <b>emu</b> (D. n. diemenensis), as they belonged to a single population until less than 14,000 years ago, when Tasmania and King Island were still connected. The small size of the King Island <b>emu</b> may {{be an example of}} insular dwarfism.|$|E
5|$|The King Island <b>emu</b> and the {{mainland}} <b>emu</b> show few morphological differences {{other than their}} significant difference in size. Mathews stated that the legs and bill were shorter than those of {{the mainland}} <b>emu,</b> yet the toes were nearly of equal length, and therefore proportionally longer. The tarsus of the King Island <b>emu</b> was also three times longer than the culmen, whereas it was four times longer in the mainland <b>emu.</b> Additional traits that supposedly distinguish this bird from the mainland <b>emu</b> have previously been suggested to be the distal foramen of the tarsometatarsus, and the contour of the cranium. However, the distal foramen is known to be variable in the mainland <b>emu</b> showing particular diversity between juvenile and adult forms and is therefore taxonomically insignificant. The same is true of the contour of the cranium, which is more dome-shaped in the King Island <b>emu,</b> a feature that is also seen in juvenile mainland emus.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{aimed to}} survey current {{practices}} in European epilepsy monitoring units (<b>EMUs)</b> {{with emphasis on}} safety issues. METHODS: A 37 -item questionnaire investigating characteristics and organization of <b>EMUs,</b> including measures for prevention and management of seizure-related serious adverse events (SAEs), was distributed to all identified European <b>EMUs</b> plus one located in Israel (N= 150). RESULTS: Forty-eight (32 %) <b>EMUs,</b> located in 18 countries, completed the questionnaire. Epilepsy monitoring unit beds are 1 - 2 in 43 %, 3 - 4 in 34 %, and 5 - 6 in 19 % of EMUs; staff physicians are 1 - 2 in 32 %, 3 - 4 in 34 %, and 5 - 6 in 19 % of <b>EMUs.</b> Personnel operating in <b>EMUs</b> include epileptologists (in 69 % of <b>EMUs),</b> clinical neurophysiologists trained in epilepsy (in 46 % of <b>EMUs),</b> child neurologists (in 35 % of <b>EMUs),</b> neurology and clinical neurophysiology residents (in 46 % and in 8 % of <b>EMUs,</b> respectively), and neurologists not trained in epilepsy (in 27 % of <b>EMUs).</b> In 20 % of <b>EMUs,</b> patients' observation is only intermittent or during the daytime and primarily carried out by neurophysiology technicians and/or nurses (in 71 % of <b>EMUs)</b> or by patients' relatives (in 40 % of <b>EMUs).</b> Automatic detection systems for seizures are used in 15 %, for body movements in 8 %, for oxygen desaturation in 33 %, and for ECG abnormalities in 17 % of <b>EMUs.</b> Protocols for management of acute seizures are lacking in 27 %, of status epilepticus in 21 %, and of postictal psychoses in 87 % of <b>EMUs.</b> Injury prevention consists of bed protections in 96 % of <b>EMUs,</b> whereas antisuffocation pillows are employed in 21 %, and environmental protections in monitoring rooms and in bathrooms are implemented in 38 % and in 25 % of <b>EMUs,</b> respectively. The most common SAEs were status epilepticus reported by 79 %, injuries by 73 %, and postictal psychoses by 67 % of <b>EMUs.</b> CONCLUSIONS: All <b>EMUs</b> have faced different types of SAEs. Wide variation in practice patterns and lack of protocols and of precautions to ensure patients' safety might promote the occurrence and severity of SAEs. Our findings highlight the need for standardized and shared protocols for an effective and safe management of patients in <b>EMUs...</b>|$|R

5|$|Despite the {{potential}} prey-predator relationship, {{the presence of}} predaceous dingoes {{does not appear to}} heavily influence <b>emu</b> numbers, with other natural conditions just as likely to cause mortality. Wedge-tailed eagles are the only avian predator capable of attacking fully-grown emus, though are perhaps most likely to take small or young specimens. The eagles attack emus by swooping downwards rapidly and at high speed and aiming for the head and neck. In this case, the emu's jumping technique as employed against the dingo is not useful. The birds try to target the <b>emu</b> in open ground so that it cannot hide behind obstacles. Under such circumstances, the <b>emu</b> can only run in a chaotic manner and change directions frequently to try and evade its attacker. Other raptors, monitor lizards, introduced red foxes, feral and domestic dogs, and feral pigs occasionally feed on <b>emu</b> eggs or kill small chicks.|$|E
5|$|Subfossil {{remains of}} the King Island <b>emu</b> show that the tibia was about 330mm (13in) long, and the femur was 180mm (7in) long. The pelvis was 280mm (11in) long, 64mm (2.5in) wide at the front, and 86mm (3in) wide at the back. The tarsometatarsus {{averaged}} 232mm (9in) in length. In males, the tibiotarsus averaged 261mm (10in), whereas it averaged 301mm (12in) in females. In contrast, the same bones measured 269mm (10.5in) and 305mm (12in) in the Kangaroo Island <b>emu.</b> Apart from being smaller, the King Island <b>emu</b> differed osteologically from the Kangaroo Island <b>emu</b> in the intertrochlear foramen of the tarsometatarsus usually being fully or partially abridged. The outer trochlea was more incurved towards the middle trochlea in the Kangaroo Island bird, whereas they were parallel in the King Island <b>emu.</b>|$|E

5|$|The King Island <b>emu</b> was the {{smallest}} of all emus, and had darker plumage than the mainland <b>emu.</b> It was black and brown, and had naked blue skin on the neck, and its chicks were striped like those on the mainland. The subspecies was distinct from the likewise diminutive Kangaroo Island <b>emu</b> (D. n. baudinianus) {{in a number of}} osteological details, including size. The behaviour of the King Island <b>emu</b> probably did not differ much from that of the mainland <b>emu.</b> The birds gathered in flocks to forage and during breeding time. They fed on berries, grass and seaweed. They ran swiftly, and could defend themselves by kicking. The nest was shallow, and consisted of dead leaves and moss. Seven to nine eggs were laid, which were incubated by both parents.|$|E
5|$|The <b>emu</b> (Dromaius novaehollandiae) is {{the second-largest}} living bird by height, after its ratite relative, the ostrich. It is endemic to Australia {{where it is}} the largest native bird and the only extant member of the genus Dromaius. The emu's range covers most of {{mainland}} Australia, but the Tasmanian <b>emu</b> and King Island <b>emu</b> subspecies became extinct after the European settlement of Australia in 1788. The bird is sufficiently common for it to be rated as a least-concern species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.|$|E
5|$|The <b>emu</b> has a {{prominent}} place in Australian Aboriginal mythology, including a creation myth of the Yuwaalaraay and other groups in New South Wales {{who say that the}} sun was made by throwing an emu's egg into the sky; the bird features in numerous aetiological stories told across a number of Aboriginal groups. One story from Western Australia holds that a man once annoyed a small bird, who responded by throwing a boomerang, severing the arms of the man and transforming him into a flightless <b>emu.</b> The Kurdaitcha man of Central Australia is said to wear sandals made of <b>emu</b> feathers to mask his footprints. Many Aboriginal language groups throughout Australia have a tradition that the dark dust lanes in the Milky Way represent a giant <b>emu</b> in the sky.

5|$|During the Late Quaternary period (0.7 {{million years}} ago), small emus {{lived on a}} number of {{offshore}} islands of mainland Australia. In addition to the King Island <b>emu,</b> these included taxa found on Kangaroo Island (D.n.baudinianus) and Tasmania (D.n.diemenensis), all of which are now extinct. The smallest taxon, the King Island <b>emu,</b> was confined to a small island situated in the Bass Strait between Tasmania and Victoria, approximately 100km (62mi) from both coasts. King Island was once part of the land bridge which connected Tasmania and mainland Australia, but rising sea levels following the last glacial maximum eventually isolated the island. As a result of phenotypic plasticity the King Island <b>emu</b> population possibly underwent a process of insular dwarfism.|$|E

5|$|In 1967, {{when the}} King Island <b>emu</b> was still {{thought to be}} only known from prehistoric remains, James Greenway {{questioned}} whether {{they could have been}} exterminated by a few natives, and speculated that fires started by prehistoric men or lightning may have been responsible. At this time, the mainland <b>emu</b> was also threatened by overhunting, and Greenway cautioned that it could end up sharing the fate of its island relatives if no measures were taken in time.|$|E
5|$|The Australian amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews coined further {{names in}} the early 1910s, {{including}} a new genus name, Peronista, as he believed the King and Kangaroo Island birds were generically distinct from the mainland <b>emu.</b> Later writers claimed that the subfossil remains found on King and Kangaroo Islands were not discernibly different, and that they therefore belonged to the same taxon. In 1959, the French ornithologist Christian Jouanin proposed {{that none of the}} skins were actually from Kangaroo Island, after inspecting expedition and museum documents. In 1990, Jouanin and Jean-Christophe Balouet used environmental forensics to demonstrate that the mounted skin in Paris came from King Island, and that at least one live bird had been brought from each island. All scientific names given to the Kangaroo Island <b>emu</b> were therefore based on specimens from King Island or were otherwise invalid, leaving it nameless. More recent finds of subfossil material and subsequent studies on King and Kangaroo Island <b>emu,</b> notably by Shane A. Parker in 1984, confirmed their separate geographic origin and distinct morphology. Parker named the Kangaroo Island bird Dromaiusbaudinianus, after Nicolas Baudin, the leader of the French expedition. The name Dromaius ater was kept for the King Island <b>emu.</b>|$|E

5|$|There are few {{morphological}} {{differences that}} distinguish the extinct insular emus {{from the mainland}} <b>emu</b> besides their size, but all three taxa were most often considered distinct species. A 2011 genetic study of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, which was extracted from five subfossil King Island <b>emu</b> bones, showed that its genetic variation fell within that of the extant mainland emus. It was therefore interpreted as conspecific with the emus of the Australian mainland, and was reclassified as a subspecies of Dromaiusnovaehollandiae, D. n. ater. Other animals present on King Island are also considered as subspecies of their mainland or Tasmanian counterparts rather than distinct species. The authors suggested that further studies using different methods {{might be able to}} find features that distinguish the taxa. In its 2013 edition, The Howard and Moore Complete Checklist of the Birds of the World emended the trinomial name of the King Island <b>emu</b> to D. n. minor, based on Spencer's D. minor, on the ground that Vieillot's D. ater was originally meant for the mainland <b>emu.</b> This rationale was accepted by the IOC World Bird List, which used D. n. minor thereafter.|$|E
5|$|There are few native natural predators of emus still alive. Early in its species history it {{may have}} faced {{numerous}} terrestrial predators now extinct, including the giant lizard Megalania, the thylacine, and possibly other carnivorous marsupials, which may explain their seemingly well-developed ability to defend themselves from terrestrial predators. The main predator of emus today is the dingo, which was originally introduced by Aboriginals {{thousands of years ago}} from a stock of semi-domesticated wolves. Dingoes try to kill the <b>emu</b> by attacking the head. The <b>emu</b> typically tries to repel the dingo by jumping into the air and kicking or stamping the dingo on its way down. The <b>emu</b> jumps as the dingo barely has the capacity to jump high enough to threaten its neck, so a correctly timed leap to coincide with the dingo's lunge can keep its head and neck out of danger.|$|E
5|$|Emus are farmed {{primarily}} for their meat, leather, feathers and oil, and 95% of the carcass can be used. <b>Emu</b> meat is a low-fat product (less than 1.5% fat), and {{is comparable to}} other lean meats. Most of the usable portions (the best cuts come from the thigh and the larger muscles of the drum or lower leg) are, like other poultry, dark meat; <b>emu</b> meat is considered for cooking purposes by the US Food and Drug Administration to be a red meat because its red colour and pH value approximate that of beef, but for inspection purposes it {{is considered to be}} poultry.|$|E
