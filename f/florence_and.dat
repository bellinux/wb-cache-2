Later in its duration, the tight pressure gradient between <b>Florence</b> <b>and</b> a high-pressure system over southeastern Canada produced strong winds and rough waves along the East Coast of the United States. The hurricane also caused strong swells and rough ocean conditions, including rip currents, in the Bahamas and Atlantic Canada. In South Carolina, high waves produced severe beach erosion on several beaches.|$|E

5|$|Cossa succeeded Alexander V as John XXIII in 1410. John XXIII was {{acknowledged}} as pope by France, England, Bohemia, Prussia, Portugal, {{parts of the}} Holy Roman Empire, and numerous Northern Italian city states, including <b>Florence</b> <b>and</b> Venice; however, the Avignon Pope Benedict XIII was regarded as pope by the Kingdoms of Aragon, Castile, and Scotland and Gregory XII was still favored by Ladislaus of Naples, Carlo I Malatesta, the princes of Bavaria, Louis III, Elector of the Palatinate, and parts of Germany and Poland.|$|E
5|$|Cossa's {{body was}} moved to the Baptistry and the nine-day funeral, as {{prescribed}} by the Ordo Romanus, was well-attended by the Florentine elite and the papal court. Cossa's corpse was crowned with a white mitre with his cardinal's hat at his feet on the funerary bier during the rituals, which took place entirely within the Baptistry and Duomo. The first three days of ceremonies celebrated in turn Cossa's role as cardinal and pope, his role as an ally of <b>Florence,</b> <b>and</b> his role as a private citizen. He received a temporary burial until the tomb was complete.|$|E
5|$|In March 1914, the Northern Epirote Declaration of Independence was {{announced}} in Gjirokastër and it was confirmed in the Protocol of Corfu. The Republic, however, was short-lived, as Albania collapsed {{at the beginning of}} World War I. The Greek military returned in October–November 1914, and again captured Gjirokastër, along with Saranda and Korçë. In April 1916, the territory referred to by Greeks as Northern Epirus, including Gjirokastër, was annexed to Greece. The Paris Peace Conference, 1919 restored the pre-war status quo, essentially upholding the border line decided in the 1913 Protocol of <b>Florence,</b> <b>and</b> the city was again returned to Albanian control.|$|E
