Seed of the introduced common chickweed (Stellaria media) and capeweed (Arctotheca calendula) are also consumed. Nectar of Grevillea alpina, and spores from moss have been recorded as food items.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{compared}} daily visitation frequency indices by 4 large (> 150 g), 7 medium-size (50 – 150 g), 5 small (30 – 50 g) and 8 {{and tiny}} (< 30 g) frugivorous bird species on fleshy <b>fruits</b> <b>of</b> two native shrubs (Olea europaea subsp. africana and Chrysanthemoides monilifera subsp. monilifera), two established alien shrubs (Solanum mauritianum and Lantana camara) and two emerging alien shrubs (Myoporum tenuifolium and Pittosporum undulatum) at nine different {{sites in the}} Cape Floristic Region. Large, medium-size and tiny birds as groups displayed significantly higher visitation frequency indices on <b>fruits</b> <b>of</b> both emerging alien shrub species than the other shrub species. Small birds as a group displayed insignificantly different visitation frequency indices on <b>fruits</b> <b>of</b> both emerging and established alien shrub species but significantly higher visitation frequency indices on <b>fruits</b> <b>of</b> both emerging and established alien shrub species than on <b>fruits</b> <b>of</b> the native shrub species. However, {{there were significant differences}} in foraging frequency indices of the bird species included within each of these body size groups on <b>fruits</b> <b>of</b> the different shrub species. Among the large birds, Columba guinea and among the medium size birds Sturnus vulgaris, Streptopelia senegalensis, Turdus olivaceus and Onychognathus morio all exhibited significantly higher visitation frequency indices on <b>fruits</b> <b>of</b> both emerging alien shrub species than on <b>fruits</b> <b>of</b> the other shrub species. These findings indicate that alien plant control measures should be focused on eradicating localised populations of emerging aliens to limit preferential consumption <b>of</b> their <b>fruits</b> by birds and consequent dispersal of their seeds that germinate readily into natural areas...|$|R

40|$|Plum fruits (Prunus domestica L.) {{have long}} been known as food for people since ancient times. They are {{consumed}} fresh, dried or processed. The increasing consumers’ demand for quality <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> is a relevant reason to present information about {{the differences in the}} chemical composition and the sensory characteristics between the widely spread and newly studied plum cultivars. The present study was carried out in the period 2009 - 2012 at the Fruit-Growing Institute – Plovdiv, Bulgaria on 12 plum cultivars. The results of chemical composition analysis showed that the <b>fruits</b> <b>of</b> ‘Jojo’, ‘Topking’, ‘Topfive’ and ‘Mirabelle de Nancy’ have a total soluble solid above 20 0 Brix. The highest sugar content was found in the <b>fruits</b> <b>of</b> ‘Jojo’. <b>Fruits</b> <b>of</b> ‘Pacific’ have the highest titratable acids content (1. 28 %) compared to the other cultivars. The highest vitamin C content (11. 92 mg/ 100 g) was determined in the <b>fruits</b> <b>of</b> ‘Stanley’ cultivar. According to the sensory data, <b>fruits</b> <b>of</b> the cultivars ‘Bellamira’, ‘President’ and ‘Tuleu Timpuriu’ were grouped as the most delicious fruits and were regarded as suitable for fresh consumption. The general sensory evaluation showed that the <b>fruits</b> <b>of</b> ‘Bellamira’, ‘Haganta’, ‘President’ and ‘Tuleu Timpuriu’ are excellent in quality and they could be recommended to consumers and traders...|$|R

5|$|As {{the bird}} became extinct before {{significant}} field observations could be made, not much {{is known about}} its behavior. The Lānai hookbill is only known to have eaten the <b>fruit</b> <b>of</b> the ōpuhe; however, {{it is unlikely that}} its unique bill would have developed to eat fruit, and {{it may have been a}} snail specialist. The hookbill has not been seen since 1918, and by 1940 nearly all of Lānai's forests were converted into pineapple fields, destroying the bird’s habitat. The combination of habitat destruction and the introduction of feral cats and rats are thought to have led to the Lānai hookbill’s extinction.|$|E
