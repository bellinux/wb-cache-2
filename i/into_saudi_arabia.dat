5|$|Initially {{believing the}} Iraqi Army would only {{advance to the}} Ramallah oil field, Schwarzkopf was {{surprised}} when the Iraqis captured Kuwait City. Fearing Iraq would next invade Saudi Arabia, Schwarzkopf ordered contingency plans put in motion, with the 82nd Airborne Division, 101st Airborne Division and 24th Infantry Division put on alert. He was then called to an emergency meeting with President George H. W. Bush, where his Internal Look '90 strategic plans were made {{the basis of a}} potential counteroffensive plan. By August 5, Bush opted for an aggressive response to the invasion. Schwarzkopf then accompanied Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney to meet with Saudi King Fahd to convince him to allow U.S. troops <b>into</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia</b> to counter the Iraqi military. With Fahd's consent, Bush ordered troops <b>into</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia</b> on August 7, initially tasked to defend Saudi Arabia should Iraq attack. U.S. commanders from the beginning wanted a quick conflict characterized by decisive, overwhelming force, as opposed to the gradual escalation of U.S. involvement as had been seen in Vietnam. Schwarzkopf in particular was very adamant that many of the policies governing military operations in Vietnam, especially slow escalation of air power and troop force, not reoccur. His plan for direct and overwhelming force was initially criticized in Washington as uncreative. By August 13, the news media began to closely cover Schwarzkopf, who had been named to lead the operation.|$|E
5|$|From his {{headquarters}} in Tampa, Schwarzkopf began planning the operations to defend Saudi Arabia. Lieutenant General Charles Horner, USAF, ran the headquarters in Riyadh. Schwarzkopf planned supply lines for the 50,000 troops initially sent to Saudi Arabia, tapping Major General William G. Pagonis {{as director of}} the logistical operations, with U.S. Air Force cargo aircraft landing supplies at Dhahran and U.S. Navy ships offloading troops and supplies at Dammam. By August 20, 20,000 U.S. troops were in Saudi Arabia, with another 80,000 preparing to deploy, and a further 40,000 reserves tapped to augment them. Schwarzkopf arrived at the CENTCOM command in Riyadh on August 25, and on August 29 he conducted his first front-line tour of the potential combat zone, accompanied by reporters. Over the next several weeks, Schwarzkopf spoke frequently with both reporters and troops under his command, conducting many high-profile press conferences and updates to the situation in Saudi Arabia. Schwarzkopf worked to help coordinate the contributions of the different nations contributing military forces to the effort. By mid-October, Schwarzkopf indicated he was confident the forces were of a sufficient level that they could defend Saudi Arabia if it was attacked. Through October, Schwarzkopf and his command were occupied with setting up facilities and supply lines for the troops streaming <b>into</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia.</b> He also worked to minimize the culture clash among foreigners in sharia-dominated Saudi Arabia, such as the high visibility of women in military roles. Schwarzkopf remained at his command in Riyadh through December, making frequent frontline visits to the troops. On December 29, 1990, he received a warning order from The Pentagon to be ready to attack into Iraq and Kuwait by January 17.|$|E

5000|$|On June 21, 2004, The Weekly Standard {{published}} an op-ed by Stalinsky titled: “Diplomatic Missionaries?” The op-ed discusses mishaps {{on the part}} of Saudi Arabian diplomats in Washington and a Government Accountability Office (GAO) investigation <b>into</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia's</b> support for Jihadisto ideology, particularly {{on the part of}} the Saudi embassy's Islamic Affairs Department (IAD). It cites instances of <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia</b> exporting and sponsoring pro-Jihadist ideology across the Islamic world, an includes quotes from the IAD website espousing this ideology. The op-ed quotes Saudi embassy officials supporting the activities of the IAD and rejecting efforts to shut it down. The op-ed suggests that after the GAO report, there will be more calls for the U.S. to take action against the Saudi embassy's Islamic Affairs Department. The op-ed also notes that Stalinsky's research was cited in the <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia</b> Accountability Act of 2009, which, if passed, would [...] "halt Saudi support for institutions that fund, train, incite, encourage, or in any other way aid and abet terrorism." ...|$|R

25|$|October {{was also}} the month where Somali forces joined the {{fighting}} alongside the Houthis. Some 200 Somali recruits arrived on boats via the Red Sea and were mainly sent on suicide missions against government and military targets in Saada City.

Other sources indicated that Somali fighters were used for engineering methods, primarily by digging trenches to hide ammunition and launch ambushes from the mountains. By December, a Somali diplomat claimed that many Somali refugees suffered abduction by the Houthis as they fled <b>into</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia.</b> Those who refused faced execution.|$|E

500|$|Saddam Hussein, who is {{believed}} to have said, [...] "The air force has never decided a war," [...] nevertheless worried that the air campaign would erode Iraq's national morale. The Iraqi leader also believed that the United States would not be willing to lose many troops in action, and therefore sought to draw Coalition ground troops into a decisive battle. In an attempt to provoke a ground battle, he directed Iraqi forces to launch Scud missiles against Israel, while continuing to threaten the destruction of oilfields in Kuwait.
