5|$|At {{the same}} time as the Fleet Air Arm was {{receiving}} its first aircraft, the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment had three FG.1s delivered to its 'C' Squadron for flight deck trials aboard Eagle. Two sets of trials were successfully carried out in March and June 1969; the first comprised approaches and touch and go landings, while the second set of trials involved full catapult launch and arrested recovery. As a result of the reheat from the Spey turbofans, the ship's jet blast deflectors (JBD) were not used; instead a steel plate was fixed to the deck to absorb the heat of the engines building to launch, and <b>fire</b> <b>hoses</b> were used after each launch to prevent them melting.|$|E
5|$|Production on {{the film}} was {{temporarily}} shut down after a fire destroyed several soundstages at Paramount Studios, {{one of which was}} adjacent to the set for the Genesis planet. Initially, the set's pyrotechnics were suspected of causing the fire, but the cause was ruled to be arson. Shatner was among the cast members who grabbed <b>fire</b> <b>hoses</b> to stop the flames. Correll hoped the place would burn down so that he would get his chance to film in Hawaii. While most of the set was undamaged, holes {{in the side of the}} building had to be covered with heavy black curtains to prevent outside light from leaking in.|$|E
5|$|The building, {{including}} the load-bearing elements, was constructed of wood. There were 10 fire extinguishers and 11 <b>fire</b> <b>hoses</b> in the hotel. Only a few escape routes had proper emergency lighting and {{directions to the}} emergency exits, and the hotel was also not on a hotline with the emergency centre of the fire department. The building had been inspected by the fire department, first in February 1976, {{and later in the}} beginning of 1977, after which the hotel's management was notified in writing that there were severe fire safety defects. They issued a list of proposed improvements to be implemented by the hotel, such as complying with the building regulations and the regulations for residence facilities.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of 6November 1995, a fire {{broke out in the}} Rova compound, {{destroying}} or severely damaging all of its buildings. Once the flames had been extinguished, all that remained of the original structures were the stone shells of the royal chapel and Manjakamiadana. Fire-fighters arrived late at the scene. Their capacity to douse the fire was hampered by the discovery that their <b>fire</b> <b>hoses</b> did not properly fit onto the nearby hydrants. In addition, the water pressure at the hydrants was significantly reduced due to Analamanga hilltop's high elevation. As the fire-fighters battled the flames, numerous bystanders ran into Rova compound buildings to retrieve artefacts of historic and cultural significance. Approximately 1,675 objects were saved out of an estimated total of 6,700. Some pillaging is believed to have occurred. On {{the night of}} the fire, the body of one of the queens was found in the public square in the centre of the city. A funeral vigil was held the following day for these royal remains. The remains were later identified as belonging to Ranavalona III, and have since been re-interred in the royal tombs at Ambohimanga.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Oblique <b>fire</b> <b>hose</b> {{instability}} is investigated using hybrid simulations for proton betas of {{the order}} of one and for proton parallel temperatures sufficiently greater than the perpendicular ones. The simulations confirm previous simulation results showing that this instability has a self-destructing properties and efficiently reduces the proton temperature anisotropy. A parametric study using one-dimensional standard hybrid simulations shows that stronger changes in the temperature anisotropy and stronger wave emissions appear for larger initial temperature anisotropies. An ideal, slow plasma expansion, modelled by a two-dimensional hybrid expanding box simulation, leads to a generation of proton temperature anisotropy. The anisotropy leads first to destabilization of the dominant parallel <b>fire</b> <b>hose</b> which interacts mainly with minor supra-Alfvénic protons whereas the evolution of core protons is determined by the expansion. Consequently, the effective anisotropy is only slightly reduced and the system eventually becomes unstable with respect to the oblique <b>fire</b> <b>hose</b> instability. The oblique <b>fire</b> <b>hose</b> strongly scatters the protons and removes the anisotropy disrupting the parallel <b>fire</b> <b>hose.</b> An important portion of the fluctuating wave energy is dissipated to protons and only long-wavelength waves remains in the system. The system with a low wave activity then develops again larger temperature anisotropies and the evolution repeats itself. It is concluded that both parallel and oblique proton <b>fire</b> <b>hose</b> instabilities constrain the proton temperature anisotropy in the expanding solar wind with the latter one constituting a final frontier for the anisotropy. These results give a possible explanation of some apparent discrepancies between observations and linear predictions. In addition, a simple bounded anisotropy model is developed to include some of the kinetic effects of the <b>fire</b> <b>hose</b> instabilities in fluid models. 1...|$|R

25|$|Connor {{enforced}} legal {{racial segregation}} and denied civil rights to black citizens, {{especially during the}} Southern Christian Leadership Conference's Birmingham campaign of 1963. He became an international symbol of institutional racism. Bull Connor directed the use of <b>fire</b> <b>hoses</b> and police attack dogs against civil rights activists; children protestors were also subject to these attacks. These tactics to continue white supremacy were covered by national media and broadcast on national television, horrifying much of the nation. The outrages served as catalysts for major social and legal change in the Southern United States and contributed to passage by the United States Congress of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.|$|E
25|$|At one point, the {{gas tank}} exploded, which put out the store’s gaslights. The men worked on by candlelight and the glow from the {{approaching}} flames. The employees got enough steam up to operate the store’s powerful pumps in the basement, and volunteers went to the roof and used the store's <b>fire</b> <b>hoses</b> to wet down the roof and the wall {{on the side of}} the oncoming fire. Early in the following morning however, the city's waterworks burned, thus ending the water supply and making further efforts useless.

25|$|In 1960, while {{opposing}} desegregation of New Orleans public schools, Perez spoke provocatively at a {{rally in}} the city.

When the schools were reopened, Perez organized a boycott by white residents. His group made threats to whites who allowed their children to attend desegregated schools. Perez arranged for poor whites to attend a segregated private school without charge, and he helped to establish a new whites-only private school in New Orleans. The Roman Catholic Church supported desegregation, and integrated its parochial schools. The bishop of New Orleans excommunicated Perez for his overt opposition to the church's teachings.|$|E
25|$|Soon, the Train was put {{in charge}} of the landing's water supply, {{something}} that had been neglected during the early stage of the campaign. As there was no supply available, water had to be brought by sea, often in petrol tins. This responsibility was given to the Train on 12 August, they were able to source three fire engines and some hoses, which, with the Train's pontoons were used to pump supplies brought from transport ships to tanks on the beach. The <b>fire</b> <b>hoses</b> were kept under guard, and eventually replaced with metal pipe as soldiers would constantly make holes in it to get at the water inside. This was just some of the work that saw the Train removed from the 11th Division and directly attached to the IX Corps Engineers, becoming responsible for all work afloat or on the beach up to the high-water mark that the Navy might require.|$|E

40|$|Using {{two-dimensional}} hybrid expanding box simulations {{we study}} {{the competition between}} the continuously driven parallel proton temperature anisotropy and <b>fire</b> <b>hose</b> instabilities in collisionless homogeneous plasmas.

This instability is generally unable to counteract the induced anisotropization and the system typically becomes unstable with respect to the oblique <b>fire</b> <b>hose</b> instability later on. The oblique instability efficiently reduces the anisotropy and the system rapidly stabilizes while {{a significant part of the}} generated electromagnetic fluctuations is damped to protons. As long as the magnetic field is in the quasi radial direction, this evolution repeats itself and the electromagnetic fluctuations accumulate. For sufficiently oblique magnetic field the expansion drives T_p>T_p and brings the system to the stable region with respect to the <b>fire</b> <b>hose</b> instabilities.
