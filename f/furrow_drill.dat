40|$|Practices {{that combine}} GPS-based {{guidance}} for terrain contouring and tillage for runoff detention have potential to increase water infiltration and reduce runoff. The {{objective of this}} study was to investigate contour planting as a means to reduce soil erosion on steep slopes of the Columbia Plateau dryland wheat region. An exploratory field study was conducted on a Ritzville silt loam (coarsesilty, mixed, superactive, mesic Calcidic Haploxerolls) and 0 - 20 percent slopes. Planting was performed with a deep <b>furrow</b> <b>drill</b> on the contour to a depth of 20 cm. Our results demonsrate that a strip of deep-furrow seeding precisely contoured on the upper shoulder slope should provide sufficient detention storage to capture and hold the runoff from a 100 -yr 24 -h storm if the contour strip area was approximately 2 % of the runoff collection area. This research also examined artificial neural networks for generating routing maps that optimize seeding on precise, GPS-guided contours. A contouring algorithm was evaluated in which the direction of a tractor is determined by contour-based neural activity whereby neurons corresponding to regions of the terrain of similar height to that of the tractor’s current position receive the greatest excitatory input. The contour region, therefore, has the global effect of influencing the whole state space to attract the tractor in the right direction.

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 Wheat (Triticum aestivum) is {{the major}} food crop {{produced}} on the Anatolian Plateau of Turkey where due to limited rainfall the farmers follow the traditional system of fallow farming. They are presently producing an average of 1. 15 tons of grain per hectare during the crop year. This rate of production {{does not meet the}} needs of the country and during the last 15 - 20 years Turkey has frequently had to import wheat. The present fallow system permits extensive livestock grazing during the late fall and winter months in the noncrop year. Spring tillage practices are delayed to permit weed growth for additional foraging by livestock during the early and late spring period. This delayed spring tillage, using wooden or steel plows, leaves the soil loose and subject to rapid drying. Little plant residue is left on the surface to protect the soil and maintain water infiltration rates. The farmer also must cultivate several times before planting in order to prepare a satisfactory seedbed. Under these conditions Turkish farmers have learned that seed planted early in the fall in dry, warm soil may be germinated by light rain, subsequently dry out and then die. Thus, they have over time adopted the practice of delaying planting until late fall when temperatures are cooler and frequent rains more certain. Under these conditions the crop is largely dependent upon late spring and early summer rains for satisfactory grain production. Climate in dryland regions of Oregon and Washington are similar to those in the Anatolian Plateau. Previous research conducted on the Anatolian Plateau indicated that modified technology from Oregon and Washington could be adopted to Turkish conditions resulting in substantial increases in grain yield. The objective of this study was to compare three fallow-tillage systems for moisture conservation and early vs. late seeding dates on subsequent grain yield of wheat. The tillage treatments were (1) a fall chisel operation followed by a spring chisel tillage, (2) chiselling twice in the spring in perpendicular directions, and (3) moldboard plowing in the spring. All three systems received subsequent tillages with a sweep-harrow combination as required to maintain a weedfree fallow and uniform seedbed. The amount of moisture conserved was not affected by the three tillage systems employed and grain yield was not different due to tillage method. All of the systems conserved sufficient water to allow early seeding into residual moisture with a deep <b>furrow</b> <b>drill.</b> A 94 per cent stand emerged within 15 days. At a later sowing date wheat was seeded into dry soil using a double disc drill. Emergence was delayed due to late rains. After 56 days an 89 per cent stand had emerged. In this experiment a 36 per cent grain yield increase resulted from early seeding; 3. 79 tons per hectare compared to 2. 79 tons per hectare from the late seeded plots, a highly significant difference. The 3. 79 tons per hectare is 2. 64 tons per hectare more than the average yield from local farms, where a traditional fallow system is followed. The major components contributing to the yield increases from early seeding were (1) more plants and heads per unit area, (2) more kernels per head and to a lesser degree (3) kernel weight. This study suggests that if Turkish farmers adopt improved summer fallow systems, wheat yields can be increased significantly; thus, reducing or perhaps eliminating the need for importing wheat. However, the loss of grazing land under a clean fallow system for livestock will need to be evaluated in terms of the total economic and social conditions to determine if the increased wheat yields warrant the change in farming practices. It is anticipated that the loss of forage during the fallow period would be offset by the increase of stubble and cereal aftermath as a result of grain yield increase during the cropping sequence...|$|E
50|$|A hoe is {{an ancient}} and {{versatile}} agricultural and horticultural hand tool used to shape soil, remove weeds, clear soil, and harvest root crops. Shaping the soil includes piling soil {{around the base of}} plants (hilling), digging narrow <b>furrows</b> (<b>drills)</b> and shallow trenches for planting seeds or bulbs. Weeding with a hoe includes agitating the surface of the soil or cutting foliage from roots, and clearing soil of old roots and crop residues. Hoes for digging and moving soil are used to harvest root crops such as potatoes.|$|R
40|$|Dysfunctional rangelands lose {{nutrients}} and material {{faster than they}} capture or create them. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the effectiveness of contour <b>furrows,</b> <b>drill</b> seeding, and aeration treatments in capturing overland flow, concentrating resources, and establishing perennial bunch grasses to convert dysfunctional semiarid rangeland to a functional rangeland. The site, located on the Edwards Plateau in west Texas, USA, had bare, structurally crusted soils with sparse short-grasses (Scleropogon brevifolius). The site had a low infiltration rate contributing to excess overland flow and loss of nutrients, organic matter, and soil. Contour furrows were installed with varying intra-furrow distances (0. 6 to 61 m) and then broadcast seeded to determine if furrow spacing would produce a vegetative response. Portions of the intra-furrow areas were aerated and drill seeded. All seed mixes contained warm season, perennial bunch grasses (Bouteloua curtipendula, Leptochloa dubia, and Setaria leucopila). Soil beneath furrows had greater soil water content (p-value < 0. 05) than intra-furrow areas. Furrow plots had greater density of seeded grasses and total vegetation (19 individuals m- 2 and 191 individuals m- 2, respectively) than intra-furrow plots (0 individuals m- 2 and 89 individuals m- 2, respectively). This study supports other findings that suggest 1. 5 m to 1. 8 m is optimum intra-furrow spacing. Vegetative responses to drill seeding and aeration treatments were insignificant. Observations suggest that contour furrows are effective at establishment and support of perennial vegetation by capturing and retaining water that otherwise would be lost to runoff from untreated soil...|$|R
50|$|Mandrillus is {{the genus}} of the {{mandrill}} and its close relative the drill. These two species {{are closely related}} to the baboons, and until recently were lumped together as a single species of baboon. Both Mandrillus species have long furrows on either side of their elongated snouts. The adult male mandrill's furrows are blue, while the <b>furrows</b> of the <b>drill</b> are black. Both species are terrestrial, living on the ground of the rainforests and occasionally grasslands of Central Africa.|$|R
50|$|Rather than {{cutting and}} turning {{the soil to}} produce ridged furrows, the ard breaks up a narrow strip of soil and cuts a shallow <b>furrow</b> (or <b>drill),</b> leaving {{intervening}} strips undisturbed. The ard is not suited for clearing new land, so grass and undergrowth are usually removed with hoes or mattocks. Cross-ploughing is often necessary to break the soil up better, where the soil is tilled twice {{at right angles to}} the original direction (lengthwise and across). This usually results in square or diamond-shaped fields and is effective at clearing annual weeds. The ard's shallow furrows are ideal for most cereals, and if the seed is sown broadcast, the ard can be used to cover the seed in rows. In fact, the ard may have been invented in the Near East to cover seed rather than till. That would explain why in Mesopotamia seed drills were used together with ards. The ard is most useful on light soils such as loams or sands, or in mountain fields where the soil is thin, and can be safely used in areas where deep ploughing would turn up hardpan or would cause salination or erosion.|$|R
25|$|When {{agriculture}} {{was first}} developed, simple hand-held digging sticks and hoes {{were used in}} highly fertile areas, such as {{the banks of the}} Nile where the annual flood rejuvenates the soil, to create <b>drills</b> (<b>furrows)</b> to plant seeds in. Digging sticks, hoes, and mattocks were not invented in any one place, and hoe-cultivation must have been common everywhere agriculture was practiced. Hoe-farming is the traditional tillage method in tropical or sub-tropical regions, which are characterised by stony soils, steep slope gradients, predominant root crops, and coarse grains grown at wide distances apart. While hoe-agriculture is best suited to these regions, it is used in some fashion everywhere. Instead of hoeing, some cultures use pigs to trample the soil and grub the earth.|$|R
40|$|Argentina has {{experienced}} {{changes in its}} agricultural production, moving from traditional practices which greatly disturbed soils towards systems that reduce soilworking. Direct seeding {{is a good example}} of the latter. Seeding machines have improved significantly in recent years, incorporating new technical and functional features. Two seeding systems are used in soybean cultivation: the traditional method which relies on planters equipped and drills (which plant in rows). The second option allows the use of a single seeding machine for wheat-soybean rotation and is the object of growing market interest. The aim of this study was to compare two direct seeding machines representative of these systems. The following variables were recorded: a) the «treatment » received by the seed (as determined by seed viability), b) the relationship between plants grown and seeds planted per row, c) the uniformity of plant distribution per linear meter of furrow, and d) yield per linear meter of furrow plus yield as kg ha- 1 at harvest. The trial was performed in 12 randomly selected plots at Nogoyá (Entre Ríos, Argentina), which for the last six years had been direct-seeded. The results obtained were compared using the Tukey test (significance set at p < 0. 05). Significant differences were found in favour of the planter with respect to «treatment » received by the seed, the quantity of viable seed distributed, sowing efficiency and yield per linear meter of <b>furrow.</b> Key words: <b>drills,</b> planters, sowing efficiency, yield, seed viability...|$|R
