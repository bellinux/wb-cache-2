25|$|Owing to tetrachloroethylene's cancer risks, California's Air Resources Board {{banned the}} {{substance}} from use in new <b>dry-cleaning</b> <b>machines</b> in 2007, with older PCE-using machines {{shut down by}} mid-2010 {{and the use of}} all such machines discontinued in California by 2023.|$|E
5000|$|Before {{the final}} {{instalment}} had been paid, AC ran into financial difficulties, and [...] "D" [...] approached [...] "T" [...] for help. [...] "T" [...] agreed {{to purchase the}} <b>dry-cleaning</b> <b>machines</b> from AC and pay the price directly to [...] "C." [...] "T" [...] also entered into another agreement with AC whereby [...] "T" [...] resold the machines to AC at exactly same purchase price, in instalments. No actual delivery took place, and AC remained {{in control of the}} machines.|$|E
40|$|International audienceUsed as {{a solvent}} in the dry-cleaning industry, {{tetrachloroethylene}} (C 2 Cl 4) {{can be a}} pollutant of residential indoor air, which can cause long-term harmful exposures because of its neurotoxicity and probable carcinogenicity. In France, dry-cleaning facilities are integrated in urban environments (shopping malls, residential buildings) and can contribute to C 2 Cl 4 exposure for customers and residents. This exploratory work presents the results from five studies carried out in one shopping mall and four residential buildings housing a dry-cleaning facility. These studies involved <b>dry-cleaning</b> <b>machines</b> fitted with a Carbon Adsorber and unfitted, with or without Air Exhaust System. Samples were collected in the cleaning facilities and in the apartments located above with passive samplers allowing measurement of time-integrated concentrations on a 7 days sampling period. It has obviously shown the degradation of indoor air quality in these environments and underlined the contributing role of the machine technology and ventilation system {{on the amount of}} released C 2 Cl 4 in the indoor air. To temper these results, it must be pointed out that some parameters (building insulation, amount of solvent used [...] .) which would influence C 2 Cl 4 fugitive release have not been quantified and should be looked at in further studies...|$|E
50|$|A <b>dry-cleaning</b> <b>machine</b> {{is similar}} to a {{combination}} of a domestic washing machine and clothes dryer. Garments are placed in the washing or extraction chamber (referred to as the 'basket' or 'drum'), which constitutes the core of the machine. The washing chamber contains a horizontal, perforated drum that rotates within an outer shell. The shell holds the solvent while the rotating drum holds the garment load. The basket capacity is between about 10 and 40 kg (22 to 88 lb).|$|R
40|$|Tetrachloroethylene, PCE (CAS 127 - 18 - 4), is a polychlorinated solvent abundantly used in French dry {{cleaning}} facilities. It {{has been identified}} as a hazardous urban air pollutant by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency causing acute, chronic and potential carcinogenic health effects. In France, dry-cleaning facilities are very frequently integrated in urban environments (large shopping malls or residential buildings) and thus can significantly contribute to PCE exposure for supermarket customers and building residents. The aim of this exploratory work is to study indoor air levels in the environment of five French cleaning facilities and assess population exposure in connection to the <b>dry-cleaning</b> <b>machine</b> technology and kind of ventilation...|$|R
