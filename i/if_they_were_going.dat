25|$|Despite {{these new}} amenities, {{many of the}} miners were disillusioned {{by the lack of}} new discoveries and left the area.

25|$|CBS did {{not want}} sportscasters to give the final score on the late-evening newscasts aired by its local affiliates. The network {{preferred}} the games to not be over by that time <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to be aired on tape later that night. Most CBS games were either 8:30 or 9:00p.m. local starts. For instance, CBS aired Games 1–3 of the 1981 Western Conference Finals, between the Houston Rockets and Kansas City Kings. Ironically, both Western Conference teams finished the regular season with a record 40–42, instead of the Eastern Conference Finals between the Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers (both teams finished with a 60–22 record).|$|E

25|$|In the Life of Crassus Plutarch {{wrote that}} in Rome {{there were reports}} about the two men's meeting with Caesar. Pompey and Crassus were asked <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to be {{candidates}} for the consulship. Pompey replied that perhaps he was, and perhaps he was not. Crassus replied that he would if {{it was in the}} interest of the city, but otherwise he would desist. When they announced their candidacies everyone withdrew theirs, but Cato encouraged Lucius Domitius to proceed with his. He withdrew it when his slave was killed. Plutarch mentioned Cato's encouragement and the murder of the slave in The Life of Pompey as well.|$|E
25|$|After {{getting off}} to 2–7 start, the Mavericks {{eventually}} found {{themselves with the}} sixth spot in the Western Conference playoff bracket for 2009 after going 50–32 (ninth consecutive 50+-win season) and about {{three to four weeks}} earlier, weren't even sure <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to make the eighth and final spot. But a run of 5–1 in their last six regular season games got them to a game over the Hornets for sixth place. Dirk Nowitzki also entered the postseason with a streak of twenty-five consecutive games of scoring 20 or more points, which was ended in {{the first game of the}} quarterfinals series versus the arch-rival, San Antonio Spurs.|$|E
25|$|Penthouse, {{started by}} Bob Guccione in England in 1965, took a {{different}} approach. Women looked indirectly at the camera, as <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> about their private idylls. This change of emphasis was influential in erotic depictions of women. Penthouse {{was also the first}} magazine to publish pictures that included pubic hair and , both of which were considered beyond the bounds of the erotic and in the realm of pornography at the time. In the late 1960s, magazines began to move into more explicit displays often focusing on the buttocks as standards of what could be legally depicted and what readers wanted to see changed. By the 1970s, they were focusing on the pubic area and eventually, by the 1990s, featured sexual penetration, lesbianism and homosexuality, group sex, masturbation, and fetishes in the more hard-core magazines such as Hustler.|$|E

25|$|This {{game was}} part of a double header at the Garda RFC Westmanstown. The Vikings {{entering}} the game as huge underdogs {{for the first time in}} many years. Making matters worse the Vikings lost starting QB Marc Ashworth and Starting RB Ryan Meches to unforeseen circumstances leaving them with a 22-man squad facing the Champions. The game started positively for the Vikings on offence gathering some first downs and field position. The Defence which was the story of the day matched the champions in every aspect and looked a better outfit than the one that lost to Belfast in the Shamrock bowl the year before. As the first half came to a close the score was a measly 0–0 with both teams showing why they have been dominant in Irish football in recent years. The Vikings cam out in the second half hoping to get some movement on offence with their Defence continuing to be Dominant and impressive. The Vikings turned to players like ever present Kieran Coen to play both sides of the ball and he was the best player on the field on the day. With many other players such as Ian Cahill, Craig Switzer, Michael Guinane, Kieran Coen, Adrian Garvey and Sean Goldrick playing Offence, Defence and Special teams the game started to wear on the Vikings. 0-0 entering the 4th quarter in unprecedented 28 degree heat there was an air of inevitability about the game with the Vikings continually running 3 and outs on offence something had to give. With less than 10 minutes left and the Trojans creeping into Viking territory there was a sense that a big play needed to be made on Defence <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to have a shot of knocking off the Trojans. That chance came with a well read pass from the Trojans QB by Craig Switzer. The ball in his hands with 60 yards of clear field in front of the speedster nickel star of the Vikings and he took his eye off the ball and it fell on the turf. The crowd, the team and everyone else knew that was the chance and sure enough 3 plays later the Trojans constant Barrage finally broke the Vikings Defensive wall and ran in for a 20-yard score with 7 minutes left. The Trojans stopped the Vikings offense after some gutsy first downs by QB Paul Keane, RB/DL Ian Cahill and WR Sean Goldrick. The Trojans played the clock down to minutes left and with the game getting away from them the Vikings Defence gave up another score leaving it 14–0 final score.|$|E

The Japanese government did not want to embarrass itself on an international stage by saying no, so the Ministry of Education was told to look into this. The Ministry logically turned to Kanō, who was a physical educator with recent experience in Europe. Kanō agreed to represent Japan at the International Olympics Committee, and, after talking to the French ambassador to Japan and reading pamphlets sent by the Swedes, developed, in his words, [...] "a fairly good idea of what the Olympic Games were." ...|$|E
