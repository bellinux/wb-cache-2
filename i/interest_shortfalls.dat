40|$|The Asset Backed CDS {{contract}} {{was introduced in}} 2005 {{as an extension of}} the standard corporate CDS. It generally trades under the ISDA "pay-as-you-go'' (PAUG) confirmation which handles the unique features of ABS - amortization, principal writedowns and <b>interest</b> <b>shortfalls.</b> The current market standard for pricing is a simple adaptation of the widely used intensity based model, where the amortization schedule of the security is deterministic. Taking example from some European ABS, we establish stylized facts about their default. In particular, we show that principal writedowns often come along with an extension of the ABS' maturity and can also be preceded by <b>interest</b> <b>shortfalls.</b> This paper introduces adjustments to the classical framework to account for these specificities, with amortization profile becoming a default-dependent function. We show that the resulting duration becomes an increasing function of spread, capturing the fact that distressed ABS shift toward slower amortization. ...|$|E

40|$|We empirically {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} financial distress on corporate ownership and control. Our analysis {{is based on a}} panel of 267 German firms that suffered from repeated <b>interest</b> coverage <b>shortfalls</b> between 1996 and 2004. We track each firm’s development over the distress cycle with particular attention to corporate ownership, restructuring, and management turnover. We find a significant decrease in ownership concentration. Private investors gradually give up their dominating role and thereby cease to be an effective source of managerial control. By contrast, ownership representation by banks and outside investors almost doubles. Shareholdings by executive and non-executive directors also substantially increase but have no effect on managerial tenure. Forced management turnover is mostly initiated by outside investors and banks and often occurs subsequent to debt restructurings, block investments, and takeovers...|$|R
40|$|Part 4 - 25 {{contains}} a uniform administrative penalty regime which covers all "taxation laws" {{as defined in}} s 995 - 1 of the ITAA 1997, that is, all those laws and regulations administered by the Commissioner. By administrative penalty regime it is meant penalties that may be applied by the Commissioner in contrast to those that may be applied by the courts for tax offences. The various tax offences are dealt with in Part III of the TAA. There is often an overlap {{in which case the}} Commissioner has an option which way to proceed. Guidelines on the circumstances where the Commissioner may refer a matter for prosecution are set out in the Corporate Management Practice Statement Fraud Control and the Prosecution Process. Typically where a prosecution is commenced administrative penalties will cease to be payable. Part 4 - 25 comprises Divisions 280, 284, 286, 288, 290 and 298. Division 280 deals with the imposition of the <b>shortfall</b> <b>interest</b> charge and the circumstances where it might be remitted. Division 286 deals with penalties for failing to lodge documents on time. Division 288 contains miscellaneous administrative penalties, such as penalties for failing to keep records, allow access or do certain things as required by the legislation. Division 290 contains civil penalties relating to the promotion and implementation of certain tax avoidance and evasion schemes. Finally, Division 298 contains various machinery provisions, such as those dealing with the remission of penalties, imposition of the general interest charge and rules relating to civil penalty proceedings...|$|R
40|$|Agricultural land values rose {{across the}} state during 1993, {{averaging}} 6. 6 percent for the year ending February 1, 1994. According to the 1994 Nebraska Farm Real Estate Market survey, largest annual increases were reported in the east, southwest, and north areas with percentage increases of 8. 9 percent, 8. 4 percent, and 8 : 0 percent respectively. While weather adversity was widespread across Nebraska during 1993, buyer interest remained keen, and appeared to intensify in late 1993 and early 1994 as crop commodity prices rose. In any local market, agricultural land values will exhibit rather pronounced ranges in market values depending upon real and perceived productivity variations. High grade land may exhibit a price premium of 20 percent or more over average grade land; while conversely, low grade land appears to be discounted by an even greater percentage. In short, the land market seems to be functioning with appropriate sensitivity to productivity variations. Market activity continues {{to be dominated by}} active farmer buyers seeking add-on units. The supply largely reflects estate settlements and retirement. Of actual 1993 transactions reported in the 1994 UNL survey, nearly half (48 percent) were outright cash purchases. This level remains high, despite the favorable mortgage financing environment which existed during 1993. The 1994 cash rental market showed some increase in cash rental rates. For irrigated land, the increase was 7 percent or more over year-earlier levels throughout much of the state. For most types of land 1994 cash rental rates represent historical highs. But despite current historical highs in annual cash rental rates, the average net percentage rates of return to agricultural real estate investment appear to range from 4 to 6 percent. At these levels, the debt-servicing potential of this type of investment is rather low. As for expectations for 1994, UNL survey reporters generally expected the level of market activity to be similar to that of 1993. More than half expected further value increases of about 5 percent with only {{a very small percentage of}} reporters expecting value declines. However, many commented that both market activity and values could be 2 ̆ 2 shocked 2 ̆ 2 by significant increases in <b>interest</b> rates or <b>shortfalls</b> in farm income during 1994...|$|R
