25|$|Malaria {{has placed}} the strongest known {{selective}} {{pressure on the}} human genome since the origination of agriculture within the past 10,000 years. Plasmodium falciparum was probably not able to gain a foothold among African populations until larger sedentary communities emerged {{in association with the}} evolution of <b>domestic</b> <b>agriculture</b> in Africa (the agricultural revolution). Several inherited variants in red blood cells have become common in parts of the world where malaria is frequent as a result of selection exerted by this parasite. This selection was historically important as the first documented example of disease as an agent of natural selection in humans. It was also the first example of genetically controlled innate immunity that operates early in the course of infections, preceding adaptive immunity which exerts effects after several days. In malaria, as in other diseases, innate immunity leads into, and stimulates, adaptive immunity.|$|E

The panel cointegration and panel causality tests are applied in this study. The results show that there is a long-run causal relationship among all variables. The short-run dynamics suggest that there is a bidirectional causality relationship between agricultural output and greenhouse gases emissions from agriculture while there is no causal relationship between foreign investments in <b>agriculture</b> and <b>domestic</b> investments in <b>agriculture</b> as well as foreign investments in agriculture and greenhouse gases emissions from agriculture. It is also found that there is unidirectional short-run causal relationship from agricultural output to <b>domestic</b> investments in <b>agriculture.</b> The results provide some important implications for policy-makers...|$|R

25|$|Agricultural {{policy is}} the set of {{government}} decisions and actions relating to <b>domestic</b> <b>agriculture</b> and imports of foreign agricultural products. Governments usually implement agricultural policies {{with the goal of}} achieving a specific outcome in the domestic agricultural product markets. Some overarching themes include risk management and adjustment (including policies related to climate change, food safety and natural disasters), economic stability (including policies related to taxes), natural resources and environmental sustainability (especially water policy), research and development, and market access for domestic commodities (including relations with global organizations and agreements with other countries). Agricultural policy can also touch on food quality, ensuring that the food supply is of a consistent and known quality, food security, ensuring that the food supply meets the population's needs, and conservation. Policy programs can range from financial programs, such as subsidies, to encouraging producers to enroll in voluntary quality assurance programs.|$|E
6000|$|... 13. I am {{strongly}} {{disposed to}} believe, {{that it is}} owning to the unwillingness of governments to allow the free egress of their corn, when it is scarce, that nations are practically so little dependent upon each other for corn, as they are found to be. According to all general principles {{they ought to be}} more dependent. But the great fluctuations in the price of corn, occasioned by this unwillingness, tend to throw each country back again upon its internal resources. This was remarkably the case with us in 1800 and 1801, when the very high price, which we paid for foreign corn, gave a prodigious stimulus to our <b>domestic</b> <b>agriculture.</b> A large territorial country, that imports foreign corn, is exposed not infrequently to the fluctuations which belong to this kind of variable dependence, without obtaining the cheapness that ought to accompany a trade in corn really free.|$|E
60|$|If {{population}} {{did increase}} {{with the increase}} of capital and in proportion to it, the fall of profits would still be inevitable. Increased population implies increased demand for agricultural produce. In the absence of industrial improvements, this demand can only be supplied at an increased cost of production, either by cultivating worse land, or by a more elaborate and costly cultivation of the land already under tillage. The cost of the laborer’s subsistence is therefore increased, and, unless the laborer submits to a deterioration of his condition, profits must fall. In an old country like England, if, in addition to supposing all improvement in <b>domestic</b> <b>agriculture</b> suspended, we suppose that there is no increased production in foreign countries for the English market, the fall of profits would be very rapid. If both these avenues to an increased supply of food were closed, and population continued to increase, as it is said to do, at the rate of a thousand a day, all waste land which admits of cultivation in the existing state of knowledge would soon be cultivated, and the cost of production and price of food would be so increased that, if the laborers received the increased money wages necessary to compensate for their increased expenses, profits would very soon reach the minimum. The fall of profits would be retarded if money wages did not rise, or rose in a less degree; but the margin which can be gained by a deterioration of the laborers’ condition is a very narrow one: in general, they can not bear much reduction; when they can, they have also a higher standard of necessary requirements, and will not. On the whole, therefore, we may assume that in such a country as England, if the present annual amount of savings were to continue, without any of the counteracting circumstances which now keep in check the natural influence of those savings in reducing profit, the rate of profit would speedily attain the minimum, and all further accumulation of capital would for the present cease.|$|E

Based on the land use, Serang river has settlements, activities, and {{agriculture}} production of citizen. By that activities, lead to come up the waste disposal which contain of BOD. To know the river’s load, can be detected by BOD measurement. BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand) is kind of characteristic to show oxygen solute which used by microorganism to degrade organic substances in aerobic (Thobanoglus, 1991). The more organic substances lay in water, the more microorganism live on it, so that increase oxygen level needed to degrade organic substance and lead to increase BOD level. Serang river’s load is dominated by <b>domestic</b> activities and <b>agriculture,</b> so that waste disposal come into the river. The impact of <b>domestic</b> and <b>agriculture</b> load on the same segment from year to year is increasing the BOD concentration. Those conditions are proved by segment 1 in 2011 have 72, 38 Kg/day BOD load and 6, 91 mg/L BOD concentration, while segment 1 in 2016 has 73, 35 Kg/day BOD load and 7, 04 mg/L BOD concentration.
