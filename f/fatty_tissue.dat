5|$|Adult {{males have}} large cheek flaps {{to show their}} {{dominance}} to other males. The cheek flaps are made mostly of <b>fatty</b> <b>tissue</b> and are supported by the musculature of the face. Mature males' throat pouches allow them to make loud calls.|$|E
5|$|Osmium tetroxide {{has been}} used in {{fingerprint}} detection and in staining <b>fatty</b> <b>tissue</b> for optical and electron microscopy. As a strong oxidant, it cross-links lipids mainly by reacting with unsaturated carbonâ€“carbon bonds and thereby both fixes biological membranes in place in tissue samples and simultaneously stains them. Because osmium atoms are extremely electron-dense, osmium staining greatly enhances image contrast in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies of biological materials. Those carbon materials have otherwise very weak TEM contrast (see image). Another osmium compound, osmium ferricyanide (OsFeCN), exhibits similar fixing and staining action.|$|E
5|$|Together with turtles, the tuatara has {{the most}} {{primitive}} hearing organs among the amniotes. There is no eardrum and no earhole, and the middle ear cavity is filled with loose tissue, mostly adipose (<b>fatty)</b> <b>tissue.</b> The stapes comes {{into contact with the}} quadrate (which is immovable), as well as the hyoid and squamosal. The hair cells are unspecialized, innervated by both afferent and efferent nerve fibres, and respond only to low frequencies. Though the hearing organs are poorly developed and primitive with no visible external ears, they can still show a frequency response from 100 to 800Hz, with peak sensitivity of 40dB at 200Hz.|$|E
50|$|Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) {{is a type}} of {{digestive}} enzyme that helps regulate the uptake of triacylglycerols from chylomicrons and other low-density lipoproteins from <b>fatty</b> <b>tissues</b> in the body. The exoenzymatic function allows it to break down the triacylglycerol into two free fatty acids and one molecule of monoacylglycerol. LPL can be found in endothelial cells in <b>fatty</b> <b>tissues,</b> such as adipose, cardiac, and muscle. Lipoprotein lipase is downregulated by high levels of insulin, and upregulated by high levels of glucagon and adrenaline.|$|R

50|$|In {{areas where}} vole populations live in close {{proximity}} to industrial areas, voles are used as a biological indicator to monitor environmental contamination, especially persistent organic pollutants such as PCBs which build up in the vole's <b>fatty</b> <b>tissues.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{veterinary}} practice, {{dogs are}} the species most commonly affected by hypothyroidism. The {{majority of cases}} occur {{as a result of}} primary hypothyroidism, of which two types are recognized: lymphocytic thyroiditis, which is probably immune-driven and leads to destruction and fibrosis of the thyroid gland, and idiopathic atrophy, which leads to the gradual replacement of the gland by <b>fatty</b> <b>tissue.</b> There is often lethargy, cold intolerance, exercise intolerance, and weight gain. Furthermore, skin changes and fertility problems are seen in dogs with hypothyroidism, {{as well as a number}} of other symptoms. The signs of myxedema can be seen in dogs, with prominence of skin folds on the forehead, and cases of myxedema coma are encountered. The diagnosis can be confirmed by blood test, as the clinical impression alone may lead to overdiagnosis. Lymphocytic thyroiditis is associated with detectable antibodies against thyroglobulin, although they typically become undetectable in advanced disease. Treatment is with thyroid hormone replacement.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} is not {{a simple}} procedure and the consequences of failure are grave. Therefore, the patient is carefully evaluated for potential difficulty or complications beforehand. This involves taking the medical history of the patient and performing a physical examination, the results of which can be scored against one of several classification systems. The proposed surgical procedure (e.g., surgery involving the head and neck, or bariatric surgery) may lead one to anticipate difficulties with intubation. Many individuals have unusual airway anatomy, such as those who have limited movement of their neck or jaw, or those who have tumors, deep swelling due to injury or to allergy, developmental abnormalities of the jaw, or excess <b>fatty</b> <b>tissue</b> of the face and neck. Using conventional laryngoscopic techniques, intubation of the trachea can be difficult or even impossible in such patients. This is why all persons performing tracheal intubation must be familiar with alternative techniques of securing the airway. Use of the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope and similar devices has become among the preferred techniques in the management of such cases. However, these devices require a different skill set than that employed for conventional laryngoscopy and are expensive to purchase, maintain and repair.|$|E

30|$|Accumulation in {{specific}} tissues, e.g. substances such as PCBs accumulate extensively in <b>fatty</b> <b>tissues</b> and organs from wildlife samples [40]. In some cases, inefficient or nonexistent detoxification processes {{may be responsible}} for high BCF values (e.g. TBT in molluscs) [41, 42].|$|R
25|$|DCM is also metabolized by {{the body}} to carbon {{monoxide}} potentially leading to carbon monoxide poisoning. Acute exposure by inhalation has resulted in optic neuropathy and hepatitis. Prolonged skin contact can result in DCM dissolving some of the <b>fatty</b> <b>tissues</b> in skin, resulting in skin irritation or chemical burns.|$|R
25|$|Local {{side effects}} are rare but can include: pain, infection, skin pigment changes, loss of <b>fatty</b> <b>tissue,</b> and tendon rupture.|$|E
25|$|The most {{prominent}} effect of JBS is pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. Varying degrees of decreased secretion of lipases, pancreatic juices such as trypsin, trypsinogen and others, {{as well as}} malabsorption of fats and disruptions of glucagon secretion and its response to hypoglycemia caused by insulin activity are major concerns when JBS is diagnosed. Associated with developmental errors, impaired apoptosis, and both prenatal and chronic inflammatory damage, necrosis and fibrosis of the pancreatic acini (clusters of pancreatic exocrine gland tissue, where secretion of pancreatic juice and related enzymes occurs), pancreatic exocrine insufficiency in JBS can additionally stem from congenital replacement of the acini with <b>fatty</b> <b>tissue.</b> Near total replacement of the entire pancreas with <b>fatty</b> <b>tissue</b> has also been reported. This is a progressive, sometimes fatal consequence of the disorder.|$|E
25|$|To {{create a}} T1-weighted image, {{magnetization}} {{is allowed to}} recover before measuring the MR signal by changing the repetition time (TR). This image weighting is useful for assessing the cerebral cortex, identifying <b>fatty</b> <b>tissue,</b> characterizing focal liver lesions and in general for obtaining morphological information, {{as well as for}} post-contrast imaging.|$|E
5000|$|Adipocere (...) , {{also known}} as corpse, grave or {{mortuary}} wax, is a wax-like organic substance formed by the anaerobic bacterial hydrolysis of fat in tissue, such as body fat in corpses. In its formation, putrefaction {{is replaced by a}} permanent firm cast of <b>fatty</b> <b>tissues,</b> internal organs, and the face.|$|R
25|$|When {{administered}} orally, ketoconazole is best absorbed at highly acidic levels, so antacids {{or other}} causes of decreased stomach acid levels will lower the drug's absorption. Absorption {{can be increased}} by taking it with an acidic beverage, such as cola. Ketoconazole is very lipophilic and tends to accumulate in <b>fatty</b> <b>tissues.</b>|$|R
50|$|With few exceptions, {{like some}} {{vitamins}} from B-complex, hypervitaminosis usually occurs more with fat-soluble vitamins (D, E, K and A or 'DEKA'), which {{are stored in}} the liver and <b>fatty</b> <b>tissues</b> of the body. These vitamins build up and remain for a longer time in the body than water-soluble vitamins.|$|R
25|$|The plantar muscles can be {{subdivided}} {{into three groups}} associated with three regions: those of the big digit, the little digit, and the region between these two. All these muscles are covered by the thick and dense plantar aponeurosis, which, together with two tough septa, form the spaces of the three groups. These muscles and their <b>fatty</b> <b>tissue</b> function as cushions that transmit {{the weight of the}} body downward. As a whole, the foot is a functional entity.|$|E
25|$|Because {{breasts are}} mostly <b>fatty</b> <b>tissue,</b> their shape can within limits be molded by clothing, such as {{foundation}} garments. Bras are commonly worn by about 90% of Western women, {{and are often}} worn for support. The social norm in most Western cultures is to cover breasts in public, though the extent of coverage varies depending on the social context. Some religions ascribe a special status to the female breast, either in formal teachings or through symbolism. Islam forbids women from exposing their breasts in public.|$|E
25|$|In JBS, {{mutations}} in the UBR1 gene alter, disrupt or prevent {{the synthesis of}} ubiquitin ligase. In the pancreatic acinar cells, UBR1 is more highly expressed {{than anywhere else in}} the body. Impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasome system directly related to insufficient activity of ubiquitin ligase has been established as the cause of both congenital and progressive inflammatory damage, <b>fatty</b> <b>tissue</b> replacement, connective tissue proliferation and errors in innervation of the acini and islets, correlating to failures of normal apoptotic destruction of damaged cells and constitutive malpresence of proteins. This also applies to other areas affected by deleterious UBR1 expression, such as the craniofacial area, musculoskeletal and nervous systems, dentition and organs.|$|E
40|$|Low-back and sciatic pain {{has long}} puzzled the medical profession. An {{imposing}} {{list of possible}} causes for this syndrome has been compiled which implicates various joint and ligamentous structures in the lumbosacral region, the spinal-nerve roots, the muscles and fascia of the lumbar area, the local <b>fatty</b> <b>tissues,</b> the abdominal aorta and iliac vessels...|$|R
50|$|The {{three main}} paths of {{exposure}} to toxaphene are ingestion, inhalation, and absorption. For humans, {{the main source of}} toxaphene exposure is through ingested seafood. When toxaphene enters the body, it usually accumulates in <b>fatty</b> <b>tissues.</b> It is broken down through dechlorination and oxidation in the liver, and the byproducts are eliminated through feces.|$|R
25|$|Dioxins are absorbed {{primarily}} through dietary intake of fat, {{as this is}} where they accumulate in animals and humans. In humans, the highly chlorinated dioxins are stored in <b>fatty</b> <b>tissues</b> and are neither readily metabolized nor excreted. The estimated elimination half-life for highly chlorinated dioxins (4â€“8 chlorine atoms) in humans ranges from 4.9 to 13.1 years.|$|R
25|$|Endocrine {{insufficiency}} of {{the pancreas}} occurs with JBS, {{though it is}} sometimes less common and less pronounced than the more prominent effects on exocrine function. The islets of Langerhans are ducts in the pancreas where endocrine activity such as the release of hormones glucagon, somatostatin and insulin takes place. Pancreatic endocrine insufficiency in JBS {{can be associated with}} either a buildup of connective tissue in the islet regions, congenital replacement of the islets with <b>fatty</b> <b>tissue,</b> or improper nerve signalling to the islets. Endocrine dysfunction of the pancreas often results in diabetes mellitus. Both insulin resistance and diabetes have been observed with JBS, and it is suggested that diabetes should be considered as a complication of JBS and its course.|$|E
25|$|Like most toothed whales, {{it has a}} {{compartment}} {{found at}} {{the centre of the}} forehead that contains an organ used for echolocation called a melon, which contains <b>fatty</b> <b>tissue.</b> The shape of the beluga's head is unlike that of any other cetacean, as the melon is extremely bulbous, lobed, and visible as a large frontal prominence. Another distinctive characteristic it possesses is the melon is malleable; its shape is changed during the emission of sounds. The beluga is able to change the shape of its head by blowing air around its sinuses to focus the emitted sounds. This organ contains fatty acids, mainly isovaleric acid (60.1%) and long-chain branched acids (16.9%), a very different composition from its body fat, and which could play a role in its echolocation system.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fatty</b> <b>Tissue.</b> In Biology, {{adipose tissue}} (/ËˆÃ¦dÉ™ËŒpoÊŠs/) or body fat or fat depot or just fat is loose {{connective}} tissue composed of adipocytes. It is technically composed of roughly only 80% fat; fat in its solitary state {{exists in the}} liver and muscles. Adipose tissue is derived from lipoblasts. Its main role is to store {{energy in the form}} of lipids, although it also cushions and insulates the body. Far from hormonally inert, adipose tissue has in recent years been recognized as a major endocrine organ, as it produces hormones such as leptin, resistin, and the cytokine TNFÎ±. Moreover, adipose tissue can affect other organ systems of the body and may lead to disease. Obesity or being overweight in humans and most animals does not depend on body weight but on the amount of body fatâ€”to be specific, adipose tissue. Two types of adipose tissue exist: white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT). The formation of adipose tissue appears to be controlled in part by the adipose gene. Adipose tissue was first identified by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner in 1551.|$|E
50|$|Crocodile oil is {{extracted}} from the <b>fatty</b> <b>tissues</b> of crocodiles and has been used both as preventive and a treatment {{for a number of}} human ailments and conditions for many years and across numerous cultures, including Ancient Egypt. It is somewhat red in color, and less viscous than alligator oil. Both were used in the tanning industry.|$|R
25|$|Fibroadenomas, are benign breast tumours {{characterized}} by an admixture of stromal and epithelial tissue. Breasts are made of lobules (milk producing glands) and ducts (tubes that carry the milk to the nipple). These are surrounded by glandular, fibrous and <b>fatty</b> <b>tissues.</b> Fibroadenomas develop from the lobules. The glandular tissue and ducts grow over the lobule to form a solid lump.|$|R
50|$|Fatty acids (provided {{either by}} {{ingestion}} or by drawing on triglycerides stored in <b>fatty</b> <b>tissues)</b> are distributed to cells {{to serve as}} a fuel for muscular contraction and general metabolism. They are broken down to CO2 and water by the intra-cellular mitochondria, releasing large amounts of energy, captured in the form of ATP through beta oxidation and the citric acid cycle.|$|R

500|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema vary based on the cause, but it {{is often associated with}} swelling of the neck and chest pain, and may also involve sore throat, neck pain, difficulty swallowing, wheezing and difficulty breathing. Chest X-rays may show air in the mediastinum, the middle of the chest cavity. A significant case of subcutaneous emphysema is easy to detect by touching the overlying skin; it feels like tissue paper or Rice Krispies. [...] Touching the bubbles causes them to move and sometimes make a crackling noise. [...] The air bubbles, which are painless and feel like small nodules to the touch, may burst when the skin above them is palpated. [...] The tissues surrounding SCE are usually swollen. [...] When large amounts of air leak into the tissues, the face can swell considerably. [...] In cases of subcutaneous emphysema around the neck, there may be a feeling of fullness in the neck, {{and the sound of the}} voice may change. If SCE is particularly extreme around the neck and chest, the swelling can interfere with breathing. The air can travel to many parts of the body, including the abdomen and limbs, because there are no separations in the <b>fatty</b> <b>tissue</b> in the skin to prevent the air from moving.|$|E
