5|$|Although {{opinions}} {{differ on}} whether the Bala Kanda narrative of Ahalya refers to the divinity of Rama, later sources assert Rama's divine status, portraying Ahalya as a condemned woman rescued by God. The Bhakti-era poets use the episode as an archetypal example to demonstrate God's saving <b>grace.</b> <b>The</b> main theme of such narratives is her deliverance by Rama, which is seen as proof of his compassion.|$|E
5|$|In Harford County, high {{waves and}} {{the storm surge}} caused {{moderate}} flooding in areas, forcing 55 to evacuate along the Bush River and 12 to evacuate along the waterfront to Havre de <b>Grace.</b> <b>The</b> promenade boardwalk in Havre de Grace was destroyed. Moderate winds left 51,600residents in the county without power. Damage in the county totaled at least $12.5million (2003USD, ($ USD).|$|E
60|$|And {{thus have}} I in few words showed you <b>the</b> <b>grace</b> of <b>the</b> Spirit, {{and how it}} putteth forth itself towards the saving of the soul. And verily, Sirs, it is {{necessary}} that you know these things distinctly--to wit, <b>the</b> <b>grace</b> of <b>the</b> Father, <b>the</b> <b>grace</b> of <b>the</b> Son, and <b>the</b> <b>grace</b> of <b>the</b> Holy Ghost; for it is not <b>the</b> <b>grace</b> of one, but of all these three, that saveth him that shall be saved indeed.|$|R
60|$|So then, it remaineth that I show you, FIRST, How we {{are saved}} by <b>the</b> <b>grace</b> of <b>the</b> Father. SECOND, How we are saved by <b>the</b> <b>grace</b> of <b>the</b> Son. And, THIRD, How we are saved by <b>the</b> <b>grace</b> of <b>the</b> Spirit.|$|R
60|$|There {{is a third}} sort, {{that think}} the holiness of the Spirit is {{sufficient}} of itself; but they (if they had it) are deceived also; for it must be <b>the</b> <b>grace</b> of <b>the</b> Father, <b>the</b> <b>grace</b> of <b>the</b> Son, and <b>the</b> <b>grace</b> of <b>the</b> Spirit, jointly, that must save them.|$|R
5|$|Short Term 12 is a 2013 American drama film {{written and}} {{directed}} by Destin Daniel Cretton. The film is based on Cretton's short film of the same name, produced in 2009. It stars Brie Larson as <b>Grace,</b> <b>the</b> supervisor of a group home for troubled teenagers.|$|E
5|$|First Light {{follows the}} {{adventure}} of two protagonists, Peter, who lives {{with his mother and}} father in New York but is in Greenland for his father's research, and Thea, who lives in an underground colony in Greenland called Gracehope. Gracehope was formed hundreds of years ago by a group called the Settlers who used to live in England. They possessed unusual abilities, such as extremely good vision and hearing, leading them to be called 'eye adepts' and 'ear adepts', respectively. These powers were seen as sorcery, prompting <b>Grace,</b> <b>the</b> leader of the Settlers, to bring the Settlers under the ice in Greenland where they could live in peace.|$|E
5|$|In its Tropical Cyclone Report on <b>Grace,</b> <b>the</b> National Hurricane Center {{reported}} that the formation of Grace was poorly forecast. The first mention of the precursor low on October1 predicted {{that it would not}} develop into a tropical or subtropical cyclone. Over the following three days, the system was not mentioned in the NHC's tropical weather outlooks until just prior to Grace's classification. The lack of preceding outlooks was attributed to the storm's unusual location and the sparsity of data for storms in the region.|$|E

5|$|On Monday, 26 August, Gloucestershire met Lancashire {{again at}} the Clifton College Close Ground and, despite another good innings by Hornby, Gloucestershire this time were victorious by 8 wickets. Grace had won the toss and put Lancashire in to bat first. <b>Grace</b> <b>the</b> bowler was once more the star {{performer}} as he took 7–77 and 5–32, {{but this time he}} did well with the bat and made a good 49 in difficult conditions. His brother Fred scored 73 not out and this was crucial to the Gloucestershire success. Grace scored 20 not out in the second innings as Gloucestershire made 32–2 to win.|$|E
5|$|The Transfiguration was a {{major theme}} in Eastern Christian art, and every Eastern Orthodox monk who had trained in icon {{painting}} had to prove his craft by painting an icon depicting it.

5|$|As Galván left a Farmacia Guadalajara {{drugstore}} {{near his}} home in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, on the evening of 27 February 2014, he was kidnapped along with businessman Miguel Ángel Ortiz. His vehicle was discovered abandoned with open doors in the pharmacy's parking lot by his wife. The following day, a disfigured corpse found in the trunk of a pickup truck in the town of García, Nuevo León, was taken to the hospital of the Autonomous University of Nuevo León. After more than a month of forensic examination, experts officially identified the corpse as that of Galván on 31 March 2014. Post-mortem reports concluded that Galván had been tortured before being killed with a coup de <b>grâce.</b> <b>The</b> exact location of Galván's murder remains unknown, although authorities tend to believe he was most likely killed in Tamaulipas.|$|E
5|$|Ascending the {{staircase}} are bronze railings with mahogany banisters. The railings {{are decorated with}} the swastika symbol which, whilst mostly associated with Nazi Germany, has been traced {{back as far as}} the 3rd millennium B.C.E. in Asia. The stairway's newel posts, on the landing between the second and third floors, are a pair of bronze ram's heads, identical newel posts <b>grace</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the stairs as well. The second floor landing offers a view of the stained glass windows, all original, which were fully restored during the 1980s renovation. Elevator access is also located on the second floor landing, the elevator was a 1950s addition to the courthouse. Originally, to access the third floor, the only option was one of two staircases. Both staircases rose from the second floor landing to the third floor, one staircase was located to either side of the stairwell leading to the landing. When the elevator was installed {{the staircase}} on the left-hand side of the landing was removed.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} Gilbert faced {{financial}} difficulty {{as an amateur}} cricketer. Most amateurs were from privileged backgrounds, whereas professionals mainly came from the working class. It was almost unthinkable for an amateur to become a professional, although many did receive financial inducements such as generous expenses and sinecure positions within county organisations. Unlike the Grace brothers, Gilbert {{did not have a}} profession outside cricket to provide a supplementary income allowing him to live comfortably. A solution seemed to arrive in 1880, when Fred <b>Grace,</b> <b>the</b> manager of the United South of England XI touring side and one of W. G. Grace's brothers, died and Gilbert took over his paid job as secretary. But the popularity of professional touring teams was already in decline, and the increasing number of matches between county teams attracted more interest. An indication of trouble came in 1882 when a professional cricketer took Gilbert to court over unpaid fees for an appearance in a match.|$|E

5|$|Covenant {{theology}} is an interpretive framework used by Reformed theologians which was significantly {{developed during the}} seventeenth century. Under this scheme, as articulated by the Assembly, God's dealings with men are {{described in terms of}} two covenants: the covenant of works and covenant of <b>grace.</b> <b>The</b> Westminster Confession was the first major Reformed symbol to explicitly mention the covenant of works (sometimes called the covenant of life), in which God offered Adam eternal life on condition of perfect obedience. In the fall of man, Adam broke the covenant of works by eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. To remedy this, God offered salvation apart from human initiative in what was called the covenant of grace. This covenant allowed man to enjoy eternal life despite his inability to obey God's law perfectly. The idea of the covenant of grace was a much more common feature of orthodox Reformed theology. The Westminster divines set these two covenants against each other as the two major ways in which God deals with people.|$|E
5|$|Further {{recognition}} {{came with}} the hanging of one of Fuller's paintings, Summer Breezes, at the Royal Academy in 1904. Other Australian artists whose works were hung {{at the same time}} included Rupert Bunny, E. Phillips Fox, Albert Fullwood, George Lambert, and Arthur Streeton. Fuller was the only woman painter to be represented. A critic writing in The West Australian observed:The work... is essentially Australian in almost every detail. Standing in a sunlit Australian paddock, a lithesome Australian blonde holds her summer hat on against the rude caresses of an Australian breeze—a subject simple but grand in its simplicity... Next to its suggestion of breezy sunshine and the incidental portrayal of willowy <b>grace</b> <b>the</b> picture is to be admired for its colour scheme... The details of the picture disclose untiring care.|$|E

From September 1945 to July 1947 he was the European Director of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Gale retired from the British Army with the honorary rank of lieutenant general in October 1947, and took up a position with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. In 1954 Harold Macmillan persuaded Gale to become chairman of the Basildon, Essex New Town Development Corporation, a post Gale served in until 1964. Macmillan described Gale {{as one of the}} most efficient officers he had ever known. Gale and Minnie lived in La Tour de Peilz, Vaud, Switzerland, where he died on 8 April 1971.
