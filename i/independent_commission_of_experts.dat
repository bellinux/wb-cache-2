40|$|The 1900 San Francisco plague is a {{significant}} event in which citizens, physicians, and public health officials denied a diagnosis of plague on economic, political, and social grounds. To resolve the controversy, Surgeon General Walter Wyman appointed an <b>independent</b> federal <b>commission</b> <b>of</b> university-based <b>experts</b> to investi-gate whether plague was present. I use the activities of Frederick Novy, the commission bacteriologist and professor at the University of Michigan, to explore one circumstance in which bacteriology attempted to rede-fine traditional conceptions of disease during the early germ era. Novy showed plague was present in the city but without its characteristic clinical features and devastating epidemiological pattern. Physicians who under-stood plague by its classic features, however, contested Novy’s scientific evidence. His bacteriologic redefini-tion had no special authority to prevail over opposing conceptions about plague; it was accepted and acted upon once it served the overall interest of the city—to avert a trade embargo. 1900 SAN FRANCISCO OUTBREAK In 1899, the mainland United States had been spared of dreaded bubonic plague epidemics [1].

40|$|Foreword] In 2017, the <b>Commission</b> <b>of</b> <b>Experts</b> on Research and Innovation is {{submitting}} its 10 th Annual Report. This is {{an opportunity}} to review the last ten years of German research and innovation policy (R&I policy). The <b>Commission</b> <b>of</b> <b>Experts</b> identifies fundamental developments in R&I policy, acknowledges important advances, and develops key recommendations for action with regard to upcoming challenges. In the election year 2017, it is even more important to provide citizens with information on clearly defined options for R&I-policy measures over the next legislative periods. The <b>Commission</b> <b>of</b> <b>Experts</b> wishes to make a contribution to this end. In the introductory chapter A 0, the <b>Commission</b> <b>of</b> <b>Experts</b> identifies challenges for R&I policy and derives objectives for the year 2025 : an increase in research and development (R&D) expenditure to 3. 5 percent {{of the gross domestic product}} (3. 5 percent target); a significant improvement in the international visibility of German universities; doubling the amount of venture capital available in Germany; a leading international position in the field of digital infrastructure; doubling the share of funds allocated to research and knowledge transfer in the domain of digital change; and a leading position in Europe in the field <b>of</b> e-government. The <b>Commission</b> <b>of</b> <b>Experts</b> describes sets <b>of</b> measures for six important fields of activity that can boost Germany 2 ̆ 019 s innovative strength: the science system (Chapter A 1), the transfer of knowledge and technology (A 2), innovation in established companies (A 3), entrepreneurship (A 4), governance of the R&I system (A 5), and digital change (A 6). Detailed analyses of the respective fields of activity are presented, and proposals are substantiated, in the corresponding chapters B 1 to B 6. Furthermore, the <b>Commission</b> <b>of</b> <b>Experts</b> submits two proposals on R&D funding through tax credits (Chapter B 7). Following an analysis of existing quantitative studies of R&D funding through tax credits in important countries, the <b>Commission</b> <b>of</b> <b>Experts</b> arrives at a positive recommendation: when designed appropriately, R&D tax credits are effective and lead to an increase in corporate R&D spending, particularly by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The introduction of such a funding instrument in Germany would be a sensible measure. According to the <b>Commission</b> <b>of</b> <b>Experts,</b> two proposals should be on the short list: a tax credit on income tax proportional to a company 2 ̆ 019 s internal R&D expenditures, or a tax credit on wage tax calculated on the basis of the R&D personnel costs incurred.
