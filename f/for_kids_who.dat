2500|$|Sissy's Magical Ponycorn Adventure was {{developed}} by Untold Entertainment Inc. developer Ryan Henson Creighton and his five-year-old daughter Cassie Creighton. Ryan {{was in charge of}} developing the game and voicing non-playable characters, while Cassie was in charge of voicing Sissy, drawing the art, creating the non-playable characters, and designing some of the puzzles. Ryan, a veteran designer of children's video games, brought Cassie with him to the Toronto Game Jam with the intent of allowing her to develop her first video game; because of her young age, Ryan had to make sure that she did not act disruptively there. On her first day at the Game Jam, she did [...] "about six hours" [...] worth of coloring, and an hour's worth of voice acting at home. Ryan took her drawings and integrated them into the Untold Graphic Adventure Game System. It took about two days to finish. The game's website has ads that play before the game loads, and a PayPal button that viewers may click on and donate money to Cassie's college fund. It was released on May 24, 2011. Ryan was not interested in making a game <b>for</b> <b>kids</b> <b>who</b> just like breasts and guns; instead, he wanted to make a game that could appeal to a broad range of people, including people who do not play games. Jaime Woo wrote that video game culture was often [...] "critical, dismissive, and negative" [...] and that the game was [...] "easy fodder" [...] due to its cute appearance. Ryan was unconcerned about potential negative response, and called it a [...] "pure, non-cynical game".|$|E
