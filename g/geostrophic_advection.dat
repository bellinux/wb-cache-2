During this period, the average mixed-layer temperature {{in the region of}} 170 - 210 (deg) E, 25 - 40 (deg) N rises by 1. 8 K.

40|$|International audienceARGO hydrographic profiles, two hydrographic transects and {{satellite}} measurements of air-sea exchange parameters {{were used to}} characterize the properties and seasonal heat budget variations of the Surface Mixed Layer (SML) south of Africa. The analysis distinguishes the Subtropical domain (STZ) and the Subantarctic Zone (SAZ), Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ) and Antarctic Zone (AZ) of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. While no Subantarctic Mode Water forms in that region, occurrences of deep SML (up to ∼ 450 m) are observed in the SAZ in anticyclones detached from the Agulhas Current retroflection or Agulhas Return Current. These are present latitudinally throughout the SAZ, but preferentially at longitudes 10 - 20 ° E where, according to previous results, the Subtropical Front is interrupted. Likely owing to this exchange window and to transfers at the Subantarctic Front also enhanced by the anticyclones, the SAZ shows {{a wide range of}} properties largely encroaching upon those of the neighbouring domains. Heat budget computations in each zone reveal significant meridional changes of regime. While air-sea heat fluxes dictate the heat budget seasonal variability everywhere, heat is mostly brought through lateral <b>geostrophic</b> <b>advection</b> by the Agulhas Current in the STZ, through lateral diffusion in the SAZ and through air-sea fluxes in the PFZ and AZ. The cooling contributions are by Ekman advection everywhere, lateral diffusion in the STZ (also favoured by the ∼ 10 ° breach in the Subtropical Front) and <b>geostrophic</b> <b>advection</b> in the SAZ. The latter likely reflects an eastward draining of water warmed through mixing of the subtropical eddies...|$|E
40|$|Interannual {{sea surface}} {{temperature}} (SST) anomalies in the South China Sea (SCS) are largely influenced by El Nino through El Nino-driven atmospheric and oceanic changes. This paper discovers a new observed {{feature of the}} SCS SST anomalies: a double-peak evolution following an El Nino event. The first and second peaks occur around February and August, respectively, in the subsequent year of the El Nino year (denoted by February [+ 1] and August [+ 1]). During and after the mature phase of El Nino, a change of atmospheric circulation alters the local SCS near-surface air temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and monsoon wind. These factors influence surface heat fluxes and oceanic flows over the SCS that can either warm or cool the SCS depending upon stages of SST anomaly evolution. The shortwave radiation and latent heat flux anomalies are major contributions to the first peak of the SCS SST anomalies, although the <b>geostrophic</b> heat <b>advections</b> warm the western boundary region of the SCS. After the first peak of February [+ 1], both the Ekman and <b>geostrophic</b> heat <b>advections,</b> assisted with a reduction of the net heat flux anomalies, cool the SCS SST anomalies. In August [+ 1], the mean meridional <b>geostrophic</b> heat <b>advection</b> makes the SCS SST anomalies peak again. Then, the latent heat flux anomalies (mainly attributed to anomalous air-sea difference in specific humidity) and the mean zonal <b>geostrophic</b> heat <b>advection</b> take over for the cooling of the SCS after the second peak...|$|R

40|$|A simple {{stochastic}} atmosphere {{model is}} coupled to a realistic {{model of the}} North Atlantic Ocean. A north–south SST dipole, with its zero line centered along the subpolar front, influences the atmosphere model, which in turn forces the ocean model by surface fluxes related to the North Atlantic Oscillation.

The oscillation consists of a fast wind-driven, positive feedback {{of the ocean and}} a delayed negative feedback orchestrated by overturning circulation anomalies. The positive feedback turns out to be necessary to distinguish the coupled oscillation from that in a model without any influence from the ocean to the atmosphere.

Detailed analyses of these two CGCMs reveal that the PDO is mainly affected by ocean heat transport rather than surface heat flux, in particular in the MRI model which has a larger contribution of ocean heat transport to the heat budget. It is found that the ocean heat transport due to Ekman advection versus <b>geostrophic</b> <b>advection</b> contributes differently to the PDO in the western and central North Pacific.

A large westward traveling wave, as described by previous authors, was observed in January 1979 during a series of minor warmings. By comparing these two events, it is shown that in both cases the superposition of traveling and quasi-stationary waves led to constructive interference that was responsible for the warmings. However, there was significant asymmetry between eastward and westward traveling components. A local Eulerian analysis of potential vorticity (PV) transport indicates that adiabatic, <b>geostrophic</b> <b>advection</b> by the resolvable scales of motion explains qualitatively (but not quantitatively) the observed potential vorticity tendencies in the LIMS Northern Hemisphere winter.

It is found that midtropospheric geostrophic vorticity and quasigeostrophic vertical motions can be diagnosed from microwave temperature measurements of only two deep layers. The lower- (1000 - 400 hPa) and upper- (400 - 50 hPa) layer temperatures are estimated from limb-corrected TIROS-N Microwave Sounding Units (MSU) channel 2 and 3 data, spatial fields of which can be used to estimate the midtropospheric thermal wind and geostrophic vorticity fields. Together with Trenberth's simplification of the quasigeostrophic omega equation, these two quantities can be then used to estimate the <b>geostrophic</b> vorticity <b>advection</b> by the thermal wind, which is related to the quasigeostrophic vertical velocity in the midtroposphere. Critical to the technique is the observation that geostrophic vorticity fields calculated from the channel 3 temperature features are very similar to those calculated from traditional, "bottom-up " integrated height fields from radiosonde data. This suggests a lack of cyclone-scale height features {{near the top of the}} channel 3 weighting function, making the channel 3 cyclone-scale "thickness " features approximately the same as height features near the bottom of the weighting function.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Previous idealized-modelling {{studies have}} shown the {{importance}} of across-jet barotropic shear to the resulting evolution of cyclones, anticyclones, surface-based fronts, and upper-level fronts. Meanwhile, many observational studies of cyclones have shown the importance of along-jet variations in the horizontal wind speed (i. e. confluence and diffluence). This study investigates {{the importance of these}} along-jet (zonal, for zonally-oriented jets) variations in the horizontal wind speed to the resulting structures and evolutions of baroclinic waves, using idealized models of growing baroclinic waves. An idealized primitive-equation channel model is configured with growing baroclinic perturbations embedded within confluent and diffluent background flows. When the baroclinic perturbations are placed in background confluence, the lower-tropospheric frontal structure and evolution initially resemble the Shapiro–Keyser cyclone model, with a zonally-oriented cyclone, strong warm front, and bent-back warm front. Later, as the baroclinic wave is amplified in the stronger downstream baroclinicity, the warm sector of the cyclone narrows, becoming more reminiscent of the Norwegian cyclone model. The upper-level frontal structure develops with a southwest–northeast orientation, and becomes strongest {{at the base of the}} trough, where <b>geostrophic</b> cold <b>advection</b> is occurring. In contrast, when the baroclinic perturbations are placed in background diffluence, the lower-tropospheric frontal structure and evolution resemble the Norwegian cyclone model, with a meridionally-oriented cyclone, strong cold front, and occluded front. The upper-level frontal structure is initially oriented northwest–southeast on the western side of the trough, before becoming zonally oriented. Weak geostrophic temperatur...|$|R

The model used is an atmospheric quasi‐geostrophic model coupled to a “slab” oceanic mixed layer, which includes mean <b>geostrophic</b> <b>advection</b> by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). The ocean‐atmosphere coupling occurs through surface heat fluxes and Ekman current heat advection. In a fully coupled simulation, the atmospheric part of the model, which includes high‐frequency transient eddies at midlatitudes, exhibits a strong Southern Annular Mode (SAM) as the first mode of variability at interannual timescales. The SAM‐related wind anomalies induce Ekman currents in the mixed layer which produce sea surface temperature anomalies. These are then advected along by the ACC. A forced mechanism where the ocean role is reduced to advect the sea surface temperature (SST) appears sufficient to reproduce the main features of the variability.

40|$|This paper characterizes Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCSs) during 2001 over Iberia and the Balearic Islands {{and their}} {{meteorological}} settings. Enhanced infrared Meteosat imagery {{has been used}} to detect their occurrence over the Western Mediterranean region between June and December 2001 according to satellite-defined criteria based on the MCS physical characteristics. Twelve MCSs have been identified. The results show that the occurrence of 2001 MCSs is limited to the August-October period, with September being the most active period. They tend to develop during the late afternoon or early night, with preferred eastern Iberian coast locations and eastward migrations. A cloud shield area of 50. 000 km(2) is rarely exceeded. When our results are compared with previous studies, it is possible to assert that though 2001 MCS activity was moderate, the convective season was substantially less prolonged than usual, with shorter MCS life cycles and higher average speeds. The average MCS precipitation rate was 3. 3 mm. h(- 1) but a wide range of values varying from scarce precipitation to intense events of 130 mm. 24 h(- 1) (6 September) were collected. The results suggest that, during 2001, MCS rainfall was the principal source of precipitation in the Mediterranean region during the convective season, but its impact varied according to the location. Synoptic analysis based on NCEP/NCAR reanalysis show that several common precursors could be identified over the Western Mediterranean Sea when the 2001 MCSs occurred: a low-level tongue of moist air and precipitable water (PW) exceeding 25 mm through the southern portion of the Western Mediterranean area, low-level zonal warm advection over 2 degrees C. 24 h(- 1) towards eastern Iberia, a modest 1000 - 850 hPa equivalent potential temperature (theta(e)) difference over 20 degrees C located close to the eastern Iberian coast, a mid level trough (sometimes a cut-off low) over Northern Africa or Southern Spain and high levels <b>geostrophic</b> vorticity <b>advection</b> exceeding 12. 10 (- 10) s(- 2) over eastern Iberia and Northern Africa.

This budget includes the mixed layer heat content variation, the surface heat fluxes, and the Ekman contribution to advection. The <b>geostrophic</b> <b>advection</b> cannot be directly estimated from Argo data but, following previous works, an ad hoc procedure is implemented to take it into account. The resulting annual budget is closed within the error bar but this closure hides some compensation between the summer and the winter residuals (− 16 ± 9 W m− 2 and 21 ± 26 W m− 2, respectively). A similar heat budget built by using colocated Argo floats in the 1 / 4 ° DRAKKAR ORCA 025 ‐G 70 fo simulation over 2001 - 2007 shows seasonal patterns similar to the Argo‐based budget.

40|$|The {{physical}} processes controlling the mixed layer salinity (MLS) seasonal {{budget in the}} tropical Atlantic Ocean are investigated using a regional configuration of an ocean general circulation model. The analysis reveals that the MLS cycle is generally weak in comparison of individual {{physical processes}} entering in the budget because of strong compensation. In evaporative regions, around the surface salinity maxima, the ocean acts to freshen the mixed layer against the action of evaporation. Poleward of the southern SSS maxima, the freshening is ensured by <b>geostrophic</b> <b>advection,</b> the vertical salinity diffusion and, during winter, a dominant contribution of the convective entrainment. On the equatorward flanks of the SSS maxima, Ekman transport mainly contributes to supply freshwater from ITCZ regions while vertical salinity diffusion adds {{on the effect of}} evaporation. All these terms are phase locked through the effect of the wind. Under the seasonal march of the ITCZ and in coastal areas affected by river (7 °S: 15 °N), the upper ocean freshening by precipitations and/or runoff is attenuated by vertical salinity diffusion. In the eastern equatorial regions, seasonal cycle of wind forced surface currents advect freshwaters, which are mixed with subsurface saline water because of the strong vertical turbulent diffusion. In all these regions, the vertical diffusion presents an important contribution to the MLS budget by providing, in general, an upwelling flux of salinity. It is generally due to vertical salinity gradient and mixing due to winds. Furthermore, in the equator where the vertical shear, associated to surface horizontal currents, is developed, the diffusion depends also on the sheared flow stability...|$|E
40|$|Ocean {{salinity}} changes play {{an important}} role in modulating ocean and climate variability. Analyses of the repeating observations along PN, TK, and 137 degrees E sections reveal that both surface and subsurface salinity in the Northwest Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG) had clear quasi-decadal oscillation (QDO) of approximate to 10 year and a sustained freshening trend during 1987 - 2012. Surface salinity in the NPSG troughed in 1989, 1999, and 2008, and peaked in 1993, and 2003. The peak-to-tough range of surface salinity oscillation can reach 0. 3 psu. Meanwhile, surface salinity decreased about 0. 10 psu from 1987 to 2012 with a freshening trend of - 0. 0042 psu yr(- 1). These surface salinity anomalies were subducted into the subsurface layer mainly in the ventilated zone along the Kuroshio Extension, and advected over the NPSG. The QDO of the subsurface salinity maximum (S-max) lagged that of the surface salinity by about 1 approximate to 2 years. Both the peak-to-tough range of the S-max oscillation (0. 15 psu) and its freshening trend (- 0. 0036 psu yr(- 1)) are smaller than those of the surface salinity. Salinity changes in the NPSG likely began in the mid- 1970 s associated with the North Pacific regime shift during 1976 / 1977. Analyses of mixed layer salinity budget indicated that air-sea freshwater flux change in the NPSG is the leading factor controlling the surface salinity anomalies, while change of large-scale ocean circulation (<b>Geostrophic</b> <b>advection)</b> also plays a minor role.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to contribute to further understanding of the stable boundary layer (SBL) over land, and its representation in atmospheric models. A SBL develops during night due to radiative surface cooling. Observations in the SBL are difficult since many different physical processes can play a role. These processes are turbulent mixing, radiative transport, a coupling with the vegetation and underlying soil, drainage flows, gravity waves, fog, and aspects of land use heterogeneity. Therefore, the understanding and {{the representation of the}} SBL in weather forecast and climate models is relatively poor, especially for calm nights. In this thesis, a detailed column model of the atmosphere-land surface system is used to represent the atmospheric boundary layer over land and ice. As such, LES results and CASES 99 field observations are used for comparison and model evaluation. It turns out that the degree of land-surface coupling {{plays a key role in}} forecasting the SBL. Also, the sensitivity of the radiation transfer model to vertical resolution is examined. It is found that the SBL can be satisfactorily modelled (except for the low-level jet (LLJ) and intermittency of the turbulence) if the <b>geostrophic</b> wind speed, <b>advection,</b> subsidence, and vegetation and soil properties are known, and if relatively high vertical resolution is used near the surface (both in the soil and in the atmosphere). The column model is used to study the nighttime 2 m temperature increase due to additional CO 2 as function of wind speed. Observations show that the temperature increase is similar for windy and calm nights, although this is somewhat counterintuitive. Model results confirm that the temperature increase is indeed similar for windy and calm nights. Next an intercomparison study of limited area weather forecast models (COAMPS, MM 5, HIRLAM) is performed for CASES- 99. Large errors occur in the forecasted minimum temperature, SBL height and diurnal temperature range. Models that account for a realistic interaction with the land surface are advantageous. A sufficient large domain is required to forecast the LLJ, and the forecasted surface cooling is very sensitive to the choice of the radiation scheme, especially for calm nights. Overall it is possible to upgrade the model performance by using the lessons learnt with the column model. In the thesis, also the role of orographic drag on the SBL is explored. It is shown that orography of 10 m amplitude can produce drag as large as the turbulent drag. Accounting for this in a model gave sufficient cyclone filling and a better forecast of the SBL structure and LLJ. The thesis concludes with studies of the SBL height. Dimensional analysis is used to derive a new and robust formulation for the SBL height for a broad range of latitude land-use conditions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSpiciness {{variability}} in the thermocline {{is believed to be}} an important subsurface ocean process affecting sea surface temperature (SST) and climate variability over the tropical oceans. Analysis of in-situ observations during 2003 – 2014 reveals pronounced spiciness variations at interannual-to-decadal timescale within the thermocline of the tropical Indian Ocean (TIO). Isopycnal potential temperature and salinity anomalies between σθ= 24. 0 – 25. 0 kgm− 3 have typical magnitudes of 0. 2 °C and 0. 08 psu in the southeastern Arabian Sea and the southern TIO, comparable with those observed in the Pacific basin. In the southeastern Arabian Sea, spiciness variations are dominated by a decadal trend, showing positive (warm, salty) anomalies in 2003 – 2006 and negative (cold, fresh) anomalies in 2009 – 2013. The major cause is the mixed-layer property change in the northern Arabian Sea, which induces variation in both spiciness and amount of water detrained down to the thermocline. In the southern TIO, largest variations occur at two zonal spiciness fronts where different thermocline water masses converge. These signals are primarily produced by wind-driven <b>geostrophic</b> <b>advection.</b> Anomalies at the northern front (11 – 6 °S) exhibit westward spreading tendency and quick diffusion, which reflect mainly the signatures of the 1 st baroclinic mode Rossby waves. Anomalies at the southern front (18 – 13 °S) move westward to the western TIO via the advection of the South Equatorial Current (SEC). These low-frequency subsurface spiciness variations can alter the background vertical thermal gradient in the thermocline ridge region (55 – 85 °E, 12 – 4 °S), although such impact on the SST variability is generally small...|$|E

Anomalous air-sea heat flux is the dominant term of the heat budget {{over most of the}} domain, while anomalous Ekman heat fluxes account for 20 - 40 % {{of the variance in the}} latitude band 40 °- 60 °S. In the ACC pathway, lateral fluxes of heat associated with anomalous geostrophic currents are a major contributor, dominating downstream of several topographic features, reflecting the influence of eddies and frontal migrations. A significant fraction of the variability of large-scale SST anomalies is correlated with either ENSO or the SAM, each mode contributing roughly equally. The relation between the heat budget terms and these climate modes is investigated, showing in particular that anomalous Ekman and air-sea heat fluxes have a co-operating effect (with regional exceptions), hence the large SST response associated with each mode. It is further shown that ENSO- or SAM-locked anomalous geostrophic currents generate substantial heat fluxes in all three basins with magnitude comparable with that of atmospheric forcings for ENSO, and smaller for the SAM except for limited areas. ENSO-locked forcings generate SST anomalies along the ACC pathway, and advection by mean flows is found to be a non-negligible contribution to the heat budget, exhibiting a wavenumber two zonal structure, characteristic of the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave. By contrast SAM-related forcings are predominantly zonally uniform along the ACC, hence smaller zonal SST gradients and a lesser role of mean advection, except in the SouthWest Atlantic. While modeled SST anomalies are significantly correlated with observations over most of the Southern Ocean, the analysis of the data-model discrepancies suggests that vertical ocean physics may play a significant role in the nonseasonal heat budget, especially in some key regions for mode water formation...|$|E
40|$|South Atlantic Ocean {{variability}} is {{investigated by}} means of an ocean general circulation model (ORCA 2), forced with the NCEP/ NCAR-reanalysis for the 1948 - 1999 period. A rotated EOF analysis of the mixed layer temperature suggests a breakdown of the South Atlantic into three subdomains, with characteristic spatial and temporal scales: (a) the tropical Atlantic, with mainly interannual fluctuations, (b) the subtropics, with variability on an interannual to decadal scale, and (c) the midlatitudes, with interannual and multidecadal variability. These modes are closely connected to anomalous atmospheric circulation patterns, which induce typical forcing mechanisms for each region. Temperature changes in the western to central tropics are found to be driven by changes in surface heat fluxes and horizontal advection of heat, while in the central to eastern tropics and the northern Benguela, temperature changes are connected to reduced vertical entrainment, altering the depth of the mixed layer and leading to reduced upwelling. In the subtropics, changes in the net surface fluxes drive the upper ocean temperature anomalies, and wind induced vertical mixing dissipates them, inducing changes in the depth of the mixed layer. Anomalous heat and volume transports are found to be related to anomalous Ekman and geostrophic currents. A wind driven mechanism is suggested, whereby changes in Ekman related heat and volume transport lead to modulations of the subtropical gyre and thus to changes in the geostrophic related heat and volume transport. The midlatitudes experience temperature changes mainly due to horizontal advection and wind induced vertical mixing, whereby <b>geostrophic</b> <b>advection</b> of heat dominates in the western to central area, and Ekman induced heat transports are confined to the eastern midlatitudes. Results from a SVD analysis between mixed layer temperatures and sea level pressure suggests that these forcing mechanisms, their associated regions and time scales, as well as heat and volume transports are also valid for the coupled ocean-atmosphere system. end{abstract}.

40|$|Several {{diagnoses of}} {{three-dimensional}} circulation, using density and velocity {{data from a}} high-resolution, upper-ocean SeaSoar and acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) survey of a cyclonic jet meander and adjacent cyclonic eddy containing high Rossby number flow, are compared. The Q-vector form of the quasigeostrophic omega equation, two omega equations derived from iterated geostrophic intermediate models, an omega equation derived from the balance equations, and a vertical velocity diagnostic using a primitive equation model in conjunction with digital filtering are used to diagnose vertical and horizontal velocity fields. The results demonstrate {{the importance of the}} gradient wind balance in flow with strong curvature (high Rossby number). Horizontal velocities diagnosed from the intermediate models (the iterated geostrophic models and the balance equations), which include dynamics between those of quasigeostrophy and the primitive equations, are significantly reduced (enhanced) in comparison with the geostrophic velocities in regions of strong cyclonic (anticyclonic) curvature, consistent with gradient wind balance. The intermediate model relative vorticity fields are functionally related to the geostrophic relative vorticity field; anticyclonic vorticity is enhanced and cyclonic vorticity is reduced. The iterated geostrophic, balance equation and quasigeostrophic vertical velocity fields are similar in spatial pattern and scale, but the iterated geostrophic (and, to a lesser degree, the balance equation) vertical velocity is reduced in amplitude compared with the quasigeostrophic vertical velocity. This reduction is consistent with gradient wind balance, and is due to a reduction in the forcing of the omega equation through the <b>geostrophic</b> <b>advection</b> of ageostrophic relative vorticity. The vertical velocity diagnosed using a primitive equation model and a digital filtering technique also exhibits reduced magnitude in comparison with the quasigeostrophic field. A method to diagnose the gradient wind from a given dynamic height field has been developed. This technique is useful for the analysis of horizontal velocity in the presence of strong flow curvature. Observations of the nondivergent ageostrophic velocity field measured by the ADCP compare closely with the diagnosed gradient wind ageostrophic velocity...|$|E
40|$|A bi-dimensional {{mixed layer}} model (MLM) {{of the global}} ocean is used to {{investigate}} the sea surface salinity (SSS) balance and variability at daily to seasonal scales.

This comparison proves the model results are consistent with observations, except at high latitudes and {{in some parts of the}} equatorial band. The salinity balance can then be analysed in all the remaining areas. The annual tendency and amplitude of each of the six processes included in the model are described, whilst providing some physical explanations. A map of the dominant process shows that freshwater flux controls SSS in most tropical areas, Ekman transport in Trades regions, <b>geostrophic</b> <b>advection</b> in equatorial jets, western boundary currents and the major part of subtropical gyres, while diapycnal mixing leads over the remaining subtropical areas and at higher latitudes. At a global scale, SSS variations are primarily caused by horizontal advection (46 %), then vertical entrainment (24 %), freshwater flux (22 %) and lateral diffusion (8 %). Finally, the simulated SSS variability is compared to an in situ climatology, in terms of distribution and seasonal variability.

40|$|Winter {{positions}} of the Arctic front (AF) during the known periods of the climate cooling (1949 – 1980) and warming (1981 – 2012) were analyzed within the sector 10 ° W – 60 ° E. The AF positios were determined by the following indicators: 1) a surface pressure; 2) horizontal wind divergence; 3) geostrophic vortex; 4) geostrophic heat advection. The main extrema of these four dynamic characteristics coincide and fall on the latitude 72. 5 ° N. This corresponds to the average position of the AF for a given resolution and confirms correctness of our choice of these characteristics as the AF indicators. Relative differences between mean profiles of all values of the above warm and cold periods were calculated using method of normalization of each value for the corresponding latitude by the standard deviation for the entire period (1949 – 2012). To study variability of the AF position we used mean yearly winter profiles of the variables under investigation together with the statistical analysis of {{positions of}} the extrema within the latitude degrees. For pressure and <b>geostrophic</b> <b>advection</b> {{positions of the}} absolute minima were determined while for geostrophic vortex and divergence – positions of the absolute maxima.  The data show that according to different criteria the AF average positions for the period 1949 – 2012 lie within the zone 72. 4 – 73. 4 N. The interannual variability of the AF positions lies within the 1 – 2 degrees of latitude and corresponds to the range of the air temperature variability above the zone of maximal changes in the sea ice area. According to the standard deviation values of the divergence and the geostrophic vortex are the most stable in region of the AF passage. Comparison of differences of the studied characteristics between the warm and cold periods shows that {{the changes in the}} AF positions are not statistically significant (P(t) < 91 % t‑criterion) unlike the changes in positions of isolines which characterize the warming (P(t) = 100 %). Thus, despite significant changes in properties of the surface and the temperature regime to the north of 72. 5 N (the warming), according to all the criteria the AF climatic position remains quasi‑stationary for 32 ‑year periods of averaging. </p...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} how coastal banks influence wind-driven circulation along stratified continental shelves. Numerical experiments are conducted for idealized symmetric banks; the standard bank (200 km long and 50 km wide) has dimensions {{similar to the}} Heceta Bank complex along the Oregon shelf. Model runs are forced with 10 days of steady winds (0. 1 Pa); upwelling and downwelling cases are compared. The bank introduces significant alongshelf variability in the currents and density fields. Upwelling-favorable winds create an upwelling front and a baroclinic jet (flowing opposite coastal-trapped wave propagation) that bend around the standard bank, approximately centered on the 90 -m isobath. The upwelling jet is strongest over the upstream bank half, where it advects a tongue of dense water over the bank. There is a current reversal shoreward of the main jet at the bank center. Upwelling is most intense over the upstream part of the bank, while there is reduced upwelling and even downwelling over other bank sections. Downwelling-favorable winds create a near-bottom density front and a baroclinic jet (flowing {{in the direction of}} coastal-trapped wave propagation) that bend around the standard bank; the jet core moves from the 150 -m isobath to the 100 -m isobath and back over the bank. The downwelling jet is slowest and widest over the bank; there are no current reversals. Results over the bank are more similar to 2 D results (that preclude alongshelf variability) than in the upwelling case. Downwelling is weakened over the bank. The density field evolution over the bank is fundamentally different from the upwelling case. Most model results for banks with different dimensions are qualitatively similar to the standard run. The exceptions are banks having a radius of curvature smaller than the inertial radius; the main jet remains detached from the coast far downstream from these banks. The lowest-order across-stream momentum balance indicates that the depth-averaged flow is <b>geostrophic.</b> <b>Advection,</b> ageostrophic pressure gradients, wind stress, and bottom stress are all important in the depth-averaged alongstream momentum balance over the bank. There is considerable variability in alongstream momentum balances over different bank sections. Across-shelf and alongshelf advection both change the density field over the bank. Barotropic potential vorticity is not conserved, but the tendency for relative vorticity changes and depth changes to partially counter each other results in differences between the upwelling and downwelling jet paths over the bank. Only certain areas of the bank have significant vertical velocities. In these areas of active upwelling and downwelling, vertical velocities {{at the top of the}} bottom boundary layer are due to either the jet crossing isobaths or bottom Ekman pumpin...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} identifies and quantifies {{the impact}} of processes driving two biogeochemical phenomena of interest by considering them {{in the context of}} the large-scale circulation in which they occur. Both processes occur in the North Pacific transition zone (NPTZ), a basin-wide region near the subpolar-subtropical gyre boundary. First, this work investigates the physical forcing behind the large seasonal variability in the location of the Transition zone chlorophyll front (TZCF). The TZCF is a persistent gradient in sea surface color that separates high chlorophyll waters to the north from low chlorophyll waters to the south. The chlorophyll front shifts seasonally by about 1000 km, oscillating between its southernmost winter latitude and its northernmost summer latitude. The forcing behind this seasonal signal is of interest because a number of migratory marine animals, both commercial and endangered, appear to track it. This first study finds that vertical processes, traditionally viewed as controlling the dynamical supply of nutrients to surface waters, are insufficient to explain seasonal variations in nutrient supply to the transition zone. Instead, the wind-driven horizontal Ekman transport of nutrients, moving southward from the subpolar gyre into the northern reaches of the subtropical gyre, drives the southward migration of the TZCF. Such lateral transport of nitrate supports up to 40 % of new primary productivity in the region annually, and nearly all of new primary productivity in the winter. Second, this work investigates why the North Pacific transition zone waters are a notably strong sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) on a mean annual basis, while seasonally they vary from a sink in the winter to a neutral to weak source in the summer. As the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO 2) in the surface mixed layer exerts primary control on the direction and magnitude of air-sea carbon exchange, this study quantifies {{the impact of}} processes regulating seawater pCO 2 : temperature, salinity, advection of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and alkalinity (ALK), mixing of DIC and ALK, biology, and air-sea carbon flux. Seasonal controls on pCO 2 in the North Pacific transition zone differ from annual controls. Temperature effects dominate the seasonal signal, but are partially countered throughout the year by opposing processes. In spring and summer, biological drawdown partially offsets the increase in pCO 2 due to warming waters; in fall and winter, the vertical entrainment of carbon moderates the decrease in pCO 2 due to cooling waters. On a mean annual basis, air-sea carbon flux, biology, mixing, and advection all have a net impact on seawater pCO 2. Though important seasonally, temperature has a small impact on pCO 2 and air-sea carbon flux annually, accounting for only about 15 - 20 % of oceanic carbon uptake through temperature-driven solubility changes. This second study again finds an important role for lateral processes to play in regulating biogeochemical phenomena in the North Pacific transition zone. The ability of the region to uptake atmospheric carbon year after year is maintained by those processes exporting carbon from its surface waters: the vertical export of organic carbon to depth, and the lateral <b>geostrophic</b> <b>advection</b> of carbon out of the region. This lateral advection alone determines the location of the sink region: of the processes impacting seawater pCO 2 on a mean annual basis, only the geostrophic divergence of DIC disproportionately lowers pCO 2 in the transition zone latitudes, supporting greater atmospheric CO 2 uptake here than in surrounding regions. This dissertation identifies and quantifies processes driving biogeochemical features in the North Pacific transition zone, finding the large-scale circulation in the region plays a significant role in regulating these processes. The unique physical oceanographic characteristics of the NPTZ, and in particular the lateral transport, support biological and chemical attributes notably distinct from adjacent waters.
