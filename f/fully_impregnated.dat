40|$|The {{performance}} of Extractant Impregnated Resin (EIR) technology for extraction of aldehydes from aqueous solutions has been investigated. The extraction capabilities of several different aliphatic and aromatic primary amines towards aldehydes were tested and compared. Aliphatic amines showed high affinity. The most promising extractant, Primene® JM-T, was immobilized in a porous particle. As a solid support three different macroporous adsorbents were tested, XAD- 16, MPP and Stamypor. Their capacities {{for the removal}} of aldehydes were compared with the non-impregnated resin and the resin impregnated with the non-reactive solvent. It was shown that the addition of a reactive extractant can increase the adsorption capacity of an otherwise poor adsorbent for several orders of magnitude. The capacity {{for the removal of}} aldehydes was increased with the increase of amine loading on the particle. Temperature influence on the sorption of benzaldehyde on <b>fully</b> <b>impregnated</b> MPP was studied. It was shown that with temperature increase, sorption capacity is increased. The stability of EIRs regarding the loss of the extractant due to the leakage in water was also studied. It was shown that immobilization reduces the extractant’s solubility in water.

In order to evaluate the ability of commercial basalt fabrics and their composites to meet the potentials of basalt fibers, the work has used raw materials from commercial catalogs with no further modification. Two common manufacturing techniques for medium performance composites have been adopted: vacuum assisted resin infusion, and hand-impregnated vacuum bagging. Two panels, one for each technique, have been fabricated, able to provide {{a sufficient number of}} samples for a comprehensive stiffness and strength characterization through Tensile, Flexural, In-Plane Shear, Short Beam Shear, Double Cantilever Beam and End-Notched Flexural tests. Results revealed a significant dependence of the mechanical properties on the manufacturing processes, due to their different ability to <b>fully</b> <b>impregnate</b> the dry fabric assembly, and on the quality of fiber/matrix adhesion.

40|$|The {{manufacturing}} process of high voltage power transformers consists of several phases such as design, assembly, drying and impregnation process which are time consuming. Before electrical testing, a transformer needs an extra standing time for further impregnation of cellulose material in particular those of high density. It {{should be noted}} that the duration of the standing time depends on the ratings of the transformer. The main reason for considering this standing time is to reduce the probability of failure during electrical testing. This means that the reduction of such standing time is a crucial issue. Therefore, the main goal of this thesis is to optimize the post impregnation process of high density cellulosic material. One of the requirements for shortening the post impregnation standing time is that during the electrical tests of the transformer the PD level should not exceed the PD acceptance given by IEC standard level. In this thesis, it is investigated if the standing time is related to the occurrence of partial discharges in high density materials. This is done by performing a number of partial discharge measurement on different samples. Further on, tan? measurements were performed on different samples in the course of impregnation process to investigate whether the losses decrease in the course of time. In this research, the impregnation processes of two different cellulosic materials, namely transformerboard (PSP) an laminated wood (KP) are studied. Based on that, an empirical model that predicts the time needed to <b>fully</b> <b>impregnate</b> a cellulosic sample is developed. This model relates the impregnation time with sample material, dimensions, shapes, impregnation and temperature.

Histological traits of the living and dead leaves of desiccation-tolerant Xerophyta scabrida (Pax) Th., Dur. et Schinz. were investigated after safranin staining to examine the dynamics of rehydration and the process ofwater transport by safranin impregnation differences. Staining that appeared on the leaf's surface epidermal glands after 30 min of remoistening in living X. scabrida leaves suggested that glandular complexes could {{take part in the}} water uptake {{from the beginning of the}} rehydration process, when the xylemmight not have been filled up, yet. The leaves of living X. scabrida became <b>fully</b> <b>impregnated</b> faster than the dead leaves: Sclerenchyma staining started from the xylem while dead X. scabrida leaves were not able to rehydrate fully. The dynamics of rehydration by the orientation of immersing leaveswas also studied. Leaves immersed into the solution with their base downward became <b>fully</b> <b>impregnated</b> earlier than the leaves sank into the dye with their apex downward. Faster water supply in the former case might have been related to the earlier recovery of xylem integrity and the resultant spatially continuous water supply. The results indicate that the living leaves of desiccation-tolerant X. scabrida were able to uptake significantwater amount not only (and not primarily) through their vascular tissues but by external water conduction. Due to the specific binding of safranin to lignifying cell walls and its fast spread from the xylem to the sclerenchymatous bundle sheaths also confirm the potential role of sclerenchyma in the water movement of leaf tissues...|$|E

40|$|The {{overall goal}} of this thesis was to develop new {{knowledge}} to facilitate the production of Norway spruce wood-based materials that are more durable and more homogenous than current materials by using a hydrophobic oil impregnation process). Linseed oil uptake and its dispersion were studied at both macroscopic and microscopic levels, when used to impregnate Norway spruce wood with the Linotech process. The effects of raw material properties, and treatments prior to impregnation, on retention of oil were also quantified. Furthermore, resulting crack development, modulus of elasticity and dimensional stability after impregnation was analysed. Finally, the possible use of Near-Infrared Spectroscopy measurements to estimate global oil uptake in impregnated wood was evaluated as well. There were significant differences in uptake between different wood tissues. Water-filled porosity (water volume divided by porosity volume) and basic density had significant effects on oil retention levels within tissue types. In addition, treatments prior to impregnation affected the oil retention levels. Furthermore, there were relatively good fits of the derived linear regressions predicting the retention of oil within all tissue types (0. 85, 0. 79, 0. 66 and 0. 69 in r 2 for mature sapwood, juvenile sapwood, mature heartwood and juvenile heartwood, respectively). Heartwood/mature wood and heartwood/juvenile wood showed 10 - 20 % weight increases due to linseed oil uptake, compared to 30 - 50 % in sapwood/mature wood in one experiment. One overall regression equation predicting oil uptake, based on Near Infrared Spectroscopy measurements, showed an r 2 as high as 0. 89. No surface cracks due to impregnation were found in sapwood samples and only occasional cracks in heartwood samples. Internal cracks with a radial orientation occurred more frequently in heartwood samples than in sapwood samples. There was a clear negative correlation between the initial water-filled porosity and the abundance of cracks that developed. The flexural modulus was largely unaffected by impregnation; however, the variation seems to become lower for impregnated sapwood specimens than for control specimens. The effects of the impregnation on dimensional stability, tested in a water soaking experiment, were strongest in dried mature sap and heartwood tissue specimens (Anti-swelling efficiency 29. 2 - 22 % and < 20 %, respectively). However, it also had positive effects on specimens representing other tissue and pre-impregnation treatment combinations. The treatments eliminated much {{of the variation in}} swelling and shrinking coefficients observed between untreated tissues. The results of the presented studies imply {{that it is possible to}} <b>fully</b> <b>impregnate</b> Norway spruce wood with a hydrophobic oil in a commercial process and to produce durable wood-based materials with homogenous properties.

40|$|Treating {{wood with}} the {{water-borne}} {{sodium salt of}} N'-N-naphthaloylhydroxylamine (Na-NHA) protects wood against decay and termite damage. Initial testing indicated little or no inhibition of sapstain fungi, molds, or soft-rot fungi by Na-NHA, suggesting that the mechanism by which this compound protected wood was complex and not that of a broad-spectrum biocide. Previously, we (Green et al, 1997) suggested that the protective mechanism was due to Na-NHA complexing with calcium ions to disrupt fungal metabolism, and/or binding of Na-NHA to the calcium in pit membranes, which acts as a physical barrier to fungal colonization. More recent experiments suggest an alternate mechanism. Specifically, pKa measurements of Na-NHA show that the sodium salt will be essentially <b>fully</b> protonated when <b>impregnated</b> into SYP which is naturally acidic (pH at or below 5. 5). Furthermore, the protonated form (H-NHA) was more fungicidal than Na-NHA against two white- and two brown-rot fungi, with the bioactivity approaching that of several commercial organic fungicides.

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of applications {{require the use of}} high temperature superconductors (HTS) such as (RE=Rare Earth) Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7 -x (REBCO) coated conductors [1]. HTS conductors show particularly great potential for high field magnets applications [1] due to their high upper critical fields [2], But several groups have shown that REBCO coated conductors are prone to delamination failure [3] [4] [5]. Under relatively low transverse stress the HTS film separates from the substrate and the conductor degrades [6]. This is problematic due to high transverse stresses that occur in <b>fully</b> epoxy <b>impregnated</b> solenoids wound with this conductor. Application of thin walled heat shrink tubing introduces a weak plane around the conductor, preventing delamination degradation [7]. However, manual application of the shrink tubing is impractical, requiring three operators limited to insulating 100 m lengths or less of REBCO conductor. The high risk of damage to the conductor, also associated with this process, shows the need for a mechanized process. Strict guidelines for the capabilities of the mechanized process were set: a single operator must have the capability to insulate continuous 200 m lengths of REBCO conductor with a minimum insulation rate of 50 m per work day. This thesis presents the ideation, prototyping, and construction of such a mechanized insulation process. Results of prototyping yielded an insulation rate of 100 m per work day with two operators, and the capacity to insulate 130 m of REBCO conductor [8]. Local critical current test indicated that no damage is caused to the tape from the insulation process [9]. A final mechanized Shrink Tube Insulation Apparatus (STIA) was developed, increasing the conductor length capacity to 450 m and reducing the number of operators to one. Due to unforeseen motor and tape tension issues, modifications to STIA were required, which increased the number of operators to two. Through a collaborative effort between the Applied Superconductivity Center (ASC) and the Kyushu University in Japan, a continuous 200 m length of Fujikora-produced REBCO conductor was provided, to be insulated by STIA. An insulation rate of 100 m per work day was achieved with two operators. In the latter of the paper, current work to rectify the issues causing the need for two operators is presented...|$|R

40|$|Continuous fibre {{reinforced}} thermoplastics are a high competitive material {{class for}} diversified applications {{because of their}} inherent properties like light-weight construction potential, integral design, corrosion resistance and high energy absorption level. Using these materials, one approach towards a large volume scaled part production rate is covered by an automated process line, consisting of a pressing process for semi-finished sheet material production, a thermoforming step and some additional joining technologies. To allow short cycle times in the thermoforming step, the utilised semi-finished sheet materials, which are {{often referred to as}} 'oganic sheets', have to be <b>fully</b> <b>impregnated</b> and consolidated. Nowadays even this combination of outstanding physical and chemical material properties combined with the economic processing technology are no guarantee for the break-through of continuous fibre reinforced thermoplastics, mainly because of the high material costs for the semi-finished sheet materials. These costs can be attributed to a non adapted material selection or choice of process parameters, as well as by unfavourable pressing process type itself. Therefore the aim of the present investigations was to generate some alternatives regarding the choice of raw materials, the set-up or the selection of the pressing process line and to provide some theoretical tools for the determination of process parameters and dimensions. Concerning raw material aspects, the use of the blending technology is one promising approach towards cost reduction for the matrix component. Novel characteristics related to the fibre structure are CF-yarns with high filament numbers (e. g. 6 K or 12 K instead of 3 K) or multiaxial fibre orientations.

The filament winding technology, the pultrusion process and the tape placement are processes suitable for the manufacturing using UD semi-finished products. The demand for parts made of UD composites is constantly increasing over the last years. A key feature for the success of this technology is the improvement of the manufacturing procedure.

The present work is related to the development of a new method for the impregnation of carbon fiber rovings with thermoset resin. The developed impregnation unit consists of a sinusoidal cavity without any moving parts. The unit in combination with an automated resin mixing-dosing system allows complete wet-out of the fibers, precise calibration of the resin fraction, and stable processing conditions. The thesis focuses on the modeling of the impregnation process.

FRCM is usually constituted by one or multiple plies of dry fabrics (carbon, glass, aramid, basalt or PBO fibers) embedded into an inorganic matrix.

40|$|Abstract An {{experimental}} CMR {{study is}} presented on the catalytic oxidation of ethane. Two different alumina membranes were investigated, the first with V loading close to monolayer coverage, the second {{with a significant}} higher V dopant degree, meaning with bulk-like V 2 O 5 as the active phase. Catalytic testing is performed under {{a wide variety of}} parameters to identify suitable regions of operation conditions. Results are compared with previous PBMR and FBR experiments in order to draw conclusions regarding the potential of the different membrane reactor configurations. After testing the membranes have been be investigated by spatially resolved SEM and XPS to evaluate the reaction induced modifications in the chemical composition and structure of the membranes. Introduction Membrane reactors are attractive in the selective oxidation of light hydrocarbons. This is due to changed reactant concentration and contact time profiles compared to the conventional fixed bed reactor (FBR) [1, 2]. Among the different membrane reactor configurations the catalytic membrane reactors (CMR) with impregnated ceramic porous membranes have several advantages. First, they can be operated with very low pressure drops because of the absence of a packed bed causing a high resistance. Second, there are significant lower permeability limitations for the oxidant e. g. compared to electrochemical or other membrane reactors with gas dense ion conducting membranes. Third, in comparison to the latter ones, operation temperature is 200 - 300 K lower, what allows to save energy costs. Despite of an intensive research in this field, catalytic membrane reactors are still far from industrial application. One of the open questions is the possibility of reversible and irreversible changes of the catalytic layer yielding modifications in the catalytic activity during the operation under local oxygen deficit conditions. Experimental Two catalytic membrane series were investigated within this study. Commercially available tubular alumina ceramic composite membrane tubes (length 250 mm, outer diameter 10 mm, inner diameter 7 mm) were used as support. The separation layer (γ-alumina, 2 µm thickness) had a pore diameter of 10 nm. The membranes were impregnated by dipping into a hot saturated solution of vanadyl acetylacetonate in acetone. Membranes were <b>fully</b> <b>impregnated</b> to suppress possible deep oxidation reactions caused by blank alumina [3]. In case of the first membrane series the dipping was performed one time for 4 hours. In case of the second series the membranes were dipped for 2 hours in the impregnation solution, then the membranes were dried at 100 °C for 30 minutes followed by a second impregnation step. After impregnation all membrane tubes were washed in cold acetone to prevent inhomogenities of the impregnated layer. Than they were dried overnight at 130 °C and calcinated at 700 °C for 4 hours. Finally, both ends of the calcinated membranes were vitrified by dipping into molten glassware in that way, that a permeable zone of 60 mm length results {{in the middle of the}} membranes. For characterisation purposes one membrane of each series was cut up. The achieved V loadings were found to be 0. 003 and 0. 15 % V, respectively. BET measurements give values of 0. 21 m²/g for both membrane series. This corresponds to a value of 42 m²/g for the separation layer. The V density (atoms/nm²) is 1. 7 for series 1 and 84 for series 2, meaning the catalytic active phase is present as well dispersed vanadate in case of series 1 and as bulk-like V 2 O 5 in series 2. Catalytic testing of membranes in the selective oxidation of ethane with varying temperatures (450 - 650 °C), feed compositions (0. 7 % ethane, 0 - 2 % O 2, balance N 2), W/F ratios (0. 103 and 0. 062 g cat. h/l) and shell to tube side ratios (0. 11 – 9) to identify best operation regions is presently underway. Additionally, the performance of one unimpregnated membrane was evaluated to check for wall reactions under real operation conditions. The results will be compared to previous PBMR and FBR experiments [2 - 4] in order to draw conclusions regarding the potential of the different membrane reactor configurations. After the catalytic testing the used membranes were cut up to check for changes due to their use inside the reactor. Cut membranes have been analyzed using SEM and XPS. The first technique provides information on structural changes and a possible V migration within the membrane. The latter one provides the details of the chemical composition and, particularly, of the effective oxidation state of vanadium (V ef. ox) in the surface layer [5]. Our spatially resolved XPS measurements provide the axial and circular mapping of the V ef. ox along the curved membrane surface thus allowing the evaluation of V ef. ox profiles during CMR operation. Also these results are compared to the classical FBR operation. References 1. A. L. Y. Tonkovich, J. L. Zilka, D. M. Jimenez, G. L. Roberts, J. L. Cox, Chem. Eng. Sci, 51 (5) (1996) 789 2. F.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to assess the {{feasibility}} of integrating nanoparticles into glass fiber (GF) reinforced isotactic polypropylene (iPP) composites via existing thermoplastic processing routes, and to investigate whether this results in significant improvements in the mechanical properties of the final composites. A longer term aim will be to extend the approach to the preparation of hybrid composites with added non-structural functionality. However, the nanoparticles that have provided the focus for the present project, montmorillonite layered silicates (MMT) and nanocarbons, were chosen for their potential as structural reinforcing elements. A melt-spinning grade and a film grade of iPP were used to prepare iPP-based nanocomposite precursors {{in the form of}} melt-spun fibers and extrusion-calendered films respectively. Long glass fiber (LGF) and glass mat thermoplastic (GMT) composites were then compression-molded from co-woven, co-wound and intercalated semi-finished products. The processing behavior and structural performance of the resulting composites are discussed in terms of the matrix morphology and its influence on the matrix rheological and mechanical properties, and interactions between the matrix and the reinforcing fibers. The nanocomposites were prepared by either (i) combined solvent and melt-mixing or (ii) direct melt-mixing. Combined solvent and melt-mixing was more suitable for dispersing carbon nanofibers (CNF), which tended to agglomerate. With iPP/MMT, both routes gave a mixed intercalated-exfoliated morphology with an MMT interlayer spacing up to 57 % greater than in the as-received MMT. However, direct melt-mixing was considered to be better suited to industrial requirements, and also more convenient for laboratory scale preparation. Melt-compounded iPP/MMT injection moldings showed a monotonic increase in stiffness with increasing MMT content, a 40 % increase in tensile modulus being measured at 13. 5 wt% MMT, for example. The tensile strength, on the other hand, reached a maximum 10 % increase over that of the pure iPP at about 3 wt% MMT, but fell off at higher MMT contents. iPP/MMT and iPP/CNF fibers were melt-spun using a laboratory-scale industrial spinning line. Processability was consistent with the melt rheology, the maximum MMT content for which fiber spinning was possible being about 5 wt%. The MMT platelets were aligned with the fiber axis over the whole range of MMT loadings and fiber draw ratios. MMT particle aspect ratios of about 150 were observed by TEM in this case, i. e. greater than in the as-compounded iPP/MMT, for which the particle aspect ratios were about 50. An aspect ratio of 150 was found to be consistent with micromechanical modeling of the observed increases in fiber stiffness with MMT content, which reached 170 % for iPP/ 2 wt% MMT fibers melt-spun with a draw ratio of 1 and a drive-roll velocity of 360 m/min. The tensile strength again reached a maximum at about 3 wt% MMT. The thermal stability of the fibers, determined by thermal mechanical analysis, also increased on MMT addition, the onset of extensive fiber creep shifting from 90 °C for pure iPP fibers to about 110 °C for iPP/ 1. 1 wt% MMT fibers. Moreover, significantly reduced shrinkage was observed in the presence of MMT, which is a potential advantage for textile based composite processing. In the case of iPP/CNF fibers, limited particle orientation and the presence of aggregates in all the formulations led to relatively poor tensile properties, about 50 % lower than those obtained with iPP/MMT fibers melt-spun with the same filler content (4 wt%) and processing conditions. iPP/MMT therefore provided the main focus for subsequent work. iPP/MMT films were produced by extrusion-calendering. Partial orientation of MMT platelets in the melt flow direction resulted in anisotropic stiffness and strength. However, both the tranverse and axial stiffnesses increased with MMT content, with improvements of up to 75 % at 5. 9 wt% MMT with respect to those of the pure iPP films, consistent with Halpin-Tsai predictions for composites containing oriented platelets with the observed aspect ratio of 50. The fracture resistance of the films, determined using modified essential work of fracture (EWF) tests, was likewise strongly dependent on the testing direction. For axial crack propagation, the EWF decreased monotonically with MMT content, but for transverse crack propagation, it reached a maximum at about 3 wt% MMT. This was attributed to orientation dependent cavitation and crack deviation {{in the presence of the}} MMT particles. Rheological measurements indicated increases in the low shear rate melt viscosity by up to two orders of magnitude on MMT addition to the iPP, with a potentially significant influence on the impregnation behavior of composite preforms. For co-woven and co-wound LGF-matrix fiber preforms, impregnation was highly dependent on the fiber bed geometry. For 40 vol% glass fiber co-wound composites, the porosity increased from about 7 vol% for a pure iPP matrix compression molded at 0. 6 MPa, to 14 vol% for a iPP/ 3. 4 wt% MMT matrix compression molded at 1. 8 MPa. However, the more intimate mixing between the fibers obtained in co-woven preforms led to more consolidated composites in each case (below 2 vol% porosity) with no filtering of the MMT particles. In modeling the impregnation kinetics of glass mat thermoplastic composites (GMT) based on iPP/MMT, the matrix was therefore considered to behave as a continuum and, for simplicity, to show Newtonian behavior. Consistent results were obtained, but in the presence of MMT, higher impregnation times were predicted than observed experimentally in model GMT preforms, owing to the nonlinear response of the nanocomposites. Moreover, under experimental conditions corresponding to the industrial process (0. 2 MPa at 200 °C), iPP/ 5. 9 wt% MMT-based hybrid composites were <b>fully</b> <b>impregnated</b> (porosity between 11 and 17 vol%) and the glass mat completely relaxed after about 30 s of compression molding, which is consistent with typical GMT industrial process cycle times (20 - 60 s). Fully consolidated 30 wt% GF - hybrid GMT specimens were prepared for mechanical testing by compression molding at 2 MPa and 200 °C for 10 min, resulting in a porosity of about 2 vol%. At room temperature, the flexural modulus and strength of iPP/MMT-based GMTs increased monotonically with MMT addition, the increases reaching about 45 % and 33 % respectively at 5. 9 wt% MMT. The increase in the flexural modulus on MMT addition was greater than predicted on the basis of a conventional rule of mixtures taking into account glass fiber orientation and aspect ratio, and the measured Young's moduli of the matrix. This was tentatively attributed to improvements in the flexural properties of the matrix in the presence of the MMT higher than those observed in tension. Increases in the flexural modulus and strength were also observed at 50 °C and 90 °C, but were less marked than at room temperature. The impact strength of the hybrid composites decreased with increasing MMT content at room temperature owing both to the decrease in matrix fracture resistance inferred from the data for the precursor films, and to an improved fiber-matrix interface as reflected by SEM observations, and argued to be due to the presence of coupling agents. Given that the presence of MMT was shown not to have serious consequences for impregnation, taken as a whole these results are considered highly promising for the implementation of nanocomposite matrices in GMT, and to establish the general feasibility of producing hybrid fiber reinforced thermoplastic nanocomposites by conventional processing routes...|$|E
