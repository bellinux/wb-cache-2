5|$|A few species, the Caribbean fire sponge Tedania ignis, cause {{a severe}} rash in humans who handle them. Turtles and some fish feed mainly on sponges.

Predation by fish may even help to spread sponges by detaching fragments.|$|E

5|$|From the mid-Heian period, {{the palace}} {{suffered}} several fires and other disasters. During reconstructions, emperors {{and some of}} the office functions resided outside the palace. This, along with the general loss of political power of the court, acted to further <b>diminish</b> <b>the</b> importance of the palace as the administrative centre. Finally in 1227 the palace burned down and was never rebuilt. The site was built over so that almost no trace of it remains. Knowledge of the palace is thus based on contemporary literary sources, surviving diagrams and paintings, and limited excavations conducted mainly since the late 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Hornsby went {{unsigned}} by {{any team}} in 1943, but he signed as a player-manager with the Vera Cruz Blues of La Liga Mexicana in Mexico in 1944. After hitting a game-winning grand slam for the second win of a series in March, he resigned when the team owner complained that the win would <b>diminish</b> <b>the</b> crowd for the third game of the series. Following his release, he did some commentary for radio station WTMV, assisted the Cleveland Indians in spring training in 1947, and became a TV announcer for Chicago Cubs games in 1949.|$|E

At the end of his term of office as vice president in January 1961, Nixon and his family returned to California, where he practiced law and wrote a bestselling book, Six Crises, which included coverage of the Hiss case, Eisenhower's heart attack, and the Fund Crisis, which had been resolved by the Checkers speech.|$|E

5|$|All LDL {{receptor}} family proteins {{contain a}} cytoplasmic tail {{with at least}} one NPXY motif. This motif is important for binding intracellular adapter proteins and endocytosis. ApoER2 is distinct from most other members of the LDL family of receptors due to a unique insert on its cytoplasmic tail. In ApoER2, there is a proline-rich 59 amino acid insert encoded by the alternatively spliced exon 19. This insert allows for protein interactions that are unable to occur with other LDL receptors. It binds the PSD-95 adapter protein, cross-linking ApoER2 and the NMDA receptors during the process of long-term potentiation, and is also bound specifically by JIP-2, an important interaction in the JNK signalling pathway. It is also speculated that this insert may <b>diminish</b> <b>the</b> function of ApoER2 in lipoprotein endocytosis by somehow disrupting the NPXY motif.|$|E
5|$|Body {{adornment}} {{has only}} recently become a subject of serious scholarly research by archaeologists, who have been hampered in studying body piercing by a sparsity of primary sources. Early records rarely discussed the use of piercings or their meaning, and while jewellery is common among grave goods, {{the deterioration of the}} flesh that it once adorned makes it difficult to discern how the jewellery may have been used. Also, the modern record has been vitiated with the 20th-century inventions of piercing enthusiast Doug Malloy. In the 1960s and 1970s, Malloy marketed contemporary body piercing by giving it the patina of history. His pamphlet Body & Genital Piercing in Brief included such commonly reproduced urban legends as the notion that Prince Albert invented the piercing that shares his name in order to <b>diminish</b> <b>the</b> appearance of his large penis in tight trousers, and that Roman centurions attached their capes to nipple piercings. Some of Malloy's myths are reprinted as fact in subsequently published histories of piercing.|$|E

5|$|Divided {{into five}} stanzas of ten lines each, the ode {{contains}} a narrator's discourse {{on a series}} of designs on a Grecian urn. The poem focuses on two scenes: one in which a lover eternally pursues a beloved without fulfilment, and another of villagers about to perform a sacrifice. The final lines of the poem declare that beauty is truth, truth beauty,' – that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know", and literary critics have debated whether they increase or <b>diminish</b> <b>the</b> overall beauty of the poem. Critics have focused on other aspects of the poem, including the role of the narrator, the inspirational qualities of real-world objects, and the paradoxical relationship between the poem's world and reality.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century, oaths {{were taken}} very seriously. As King, James was Head of the Church of Scotland or Kirk, sworn by his Coronation Oath to {{preserve}} its position and privileges. The Test Act required government officials and MPs to swear an Oath of Allegiance to the Protestant religion and the monarch, regardless of personal religion. James thus received their support despite his own Catholicism but promised not to <b>diminish</b> <b>the</b> primacy of the Church of Scotland. Removing these restrictions was seen as contrary to that commitment. Many MPs were also members of the Episcopalian minority imposed on the Kirk in 1661; Argyll's defeat showed the weakening of Presbyterian influence but voting for these measures would undo that. James' credibility was seriously damaged, since he appeared willing to ignore his previous commitments, his Coronation Oath and his most loyal supporters.|$|E

In 1187 he was appointed treasurer of the priory, and in that role was sent by the cathedral chapter to King Henry II of England to plead their case against Baldwin of Forde, the Archbishop of Canterbury. The archbishop and his monks were in dispute over Baldwin's plan to found a collegiate church at Hackington in honour of Thomas Becket which most of the monks opposed because they feared it would <b>diminish</b> <b>the</b> prestige of their priory.|$|E

He visited Pennsylvania in April to discuss the Libertarian Party's platform with students from Penn State. Native American activist, and challenger to Paul, Russell Means of South Dakota also appeared at the event. Means had officially announced his Libertarian presidential nomination candidacy a day before Paul. While Means received heightened media attention for his comments regarding Native Americans and militancy, reports in the news media circulated that highlighted Paul's calls for the nation to return to the Gold Standard, and <b>diminish</b> <b>the</b> power of the Federal Reserve. Paul and Means were described as members of the right and left wing of the Libertarian Party, respectively.|$|E
5|$|She {{identifies}} the UN as the book's villain and criticizes the UN's practise of moral equivalency that treats both sides equally even though {{one side is}} clearly dominant and brutally oppressive. It results in the requirement of its personnel to remain neutral but Off questions how a peacekeeper can remain neutral while watching people being killed. The book treats this as a reality of international relations, which places precedence on state sovereignty over human rights, and a factor in making the UN slow, ineffectual, and inappropriately bureaucratic. She notes that some peacekeepers cope by demonizing all sides which helps <b>diminish</b> <b>the</b> sense of impotence in being unable to intervene.|$|E
5|$|The F-4s {{and their}} crews, however, proved {{equal to the}} {{situation}} and claimed seven MiG-21s destroyed, {{almost half of the}} 16 then in service with the VPAF without loss to USAF aircraft. Olds himself shot down one of the seven, for which he and the other aircrew were awarded Silver Stars. Follow-up interceptions over the next two days by MiGs against RF-4C reconnaissance aircraft led to a similar mission on a smaller scale on January 6, with another two MiG-21s shot down. VPAF fighter activity diminished to almost nothing for 10 weeks afterwards, thereby accomplishing the main goal of Operation Bolo: to eliminate or <b>diminish</b> <b>the</b> threat of MiGs to the strike formations.|$|E
