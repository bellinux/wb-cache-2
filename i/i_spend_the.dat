On Christmas Eve, Derrick noted in his diary that the next day would be his [...] "4th Xmas overseas" [...] and [...] "I don't care where <b>I</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> next one I only hope I'm still on deck [...] ". On 7 February 1944, the battalion sailed from Finschhafen for Australia, disembarking at Brisbane. Granted home leave, Derrick {{made his way to}} South Australia for a short period with Beryl. In April, he was admitted to hospital suffering from malaria before returning to his battalion the following month. During this time, he was charged with being absent without leave and subsequently forfeited a day's pay.|$|E

2500|$|The American author Nathaniel Hawthorne {{writes of}} Cathay as a remote, exotic and {{difficult}} to reach location in [...] "Footprints on the Seashore", a short story from his 1837 collection Twice-Told Tales. On listening to the sea's unchanging voice the solitary author writes: [...] "This is wisdom, and therefore will <b>I</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> next half-hour in shaping little boats of driftwood and launching them on voyages across the cove, with the feather of a seagull for a shade.

Yet how would the merchant sneer at me!" ...|$|E

Radwańska also took the Toray Pan-Pacific in 2011, and is {{the first player to}} have won the event twice since it moved outdoors, and onto a hard court, in 2008. [...] "This is the first tournament I have won twice, so it's very special for me," [...] said Radwanska. She added, [...] "I really didn't expect that kind of score against Belinda, she's playing so well.

6000|$|April 23.--Off to New York on {{a little}} tour and visit. Leaving the hospitable, home-like {{quarters}} of my valued friends, Mr. and Mrs. J. H. Johnston--took the 4 P. M. boat, bound up the Hudson, 100 miles or so. Sunset and evening fine. Especially enjoy'd the hour after we passed Cozzens's landing--the night lit by the crescent moon and Venus, now swimming in tender glory, and now hid by the high rocks and hills of the western shore, which we hugg'd close. (Where <b>I</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> next ten days is in Ulster county and its neighborhood, with frequent morning and evening drives, observations of the river, and short rambles.) ...|$|E
6000|$|He stopped, {{and made}} a little gesture. [...] "Of course, there are big hotels where one could meet {{pleasant}} people, as well as operas and theatres, at Winnipeg, and one could get there in two days on the cars. I dare say I could manage a trip to Montreal or New York occasionally too, {{and we have a}} few well-educated people from the East on the prairie not more than twenty miles away; but, since I have nobody to go with, going away from home doesn't appeal to me, so <b>I</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> long night sitting beside the stove with the cedar shingles crackling over me in the cold. Now and then I read, and when I don't there is plenty to think about in planning out the next year's campaign." ...|$|E

60|$|It was on {{a bright}} winter's day {{in the month of}} January 1846 that I was sent for by the Governor, and told to hold myself in {{readiness}} to start early the following morning with Mr Stone for Tadousac--adding, that probably <b>I</b> should <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> approaching summer at Seven Islands.|$|R
6000|$|Dinner being over, I throw {{myself at}} length upon the sand and, {{basking in the}} sunshine, let my mind disport itself at will. The walls of this my hermitage have no tongue to tell my follies, though I {{sometimes}} fancy that they have ears to hear them and a soul to sympathize. There is a magic in this spot. Dreams haunt its precincts and flit around me in broad sunlight, nor require that sleep shall blindfold me to real objects ere these be visible. Here can I frame a story of two lovers, and make their shadows live before me and be mirrored in the tranquil water as they tread along the sand, leaving no footprints. Here, should I will it, I can summon up a single shade and be myself her lover.--Yes, dreamer, but your lonely heart will be the colder for such fancies.--Sometimes, too, the Past comes back, and finds me here, and in her train come faces which were gladsome when I knew them, yet seem not gladsome now. Would that my hiding-place were lonelier, so that the Past might not find me!--Get ye all gone, old friends, and let me listen to the murmur of the sea--a melancholy voice, but less sad than yours. Of what mysteries is it telling? Of sunken ships and whereabouts they lie? Of islands afar and undiscovered whose tawny children are unconscious of other islands and of continents, and deem the stars of heaven their nearest neighbors? Nothing of all this. What, then? Has it talked for so many ages and meant nothing all the while? No; for those ages find utterance in the sea's unchanging voice, and warn the listener to withdraw his interest from mortal vicissitudes and let the infinite idea of eternity pervade his soul. This is wisdom, and therefore will <b>I</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> next half-hour in shaping little boats of driftwood and launching them on voyages across the cove, with the feather of a sea-gull for a sail. If the voice of ages tell me true, this is as wise an occupation as to build ships of five hundred tons and launch them forth upon the main, bound to [...] "Far Cathay."

6000|$|It is {{my desire}} that this, which I shall post here to-morrow, shall be a tiny {{item in the}} hecatomb of {{friendship}} gracing your breakfast table on Christmas morning and mingling the smoke of (certain) aged and infirm victims with the finer and fresher fumes of the board. But the aged and infirm propose and the postman disposes and I can only hope I shall not be either disconcertingly previous or ineffectively subsequent. If my mind's eye loses you at sweet (yet sublime) Underbank, I still {{see you in a}} Devonshire mild light and feel your Torquay window letting in your Torquay air--which, at this distance, in this sadly Southeasternized corner, suggests all sorts of enviable balm and beatitude. It was a real pang to me, some weeks ago, when you were coming up to town, to have to put behind me, with so ungracious and uncompromising a gesture, the question, and the great temptation, of being there for a little at the same moment. But there are hours and seasons--and I know the face of them well--when my need to mind my business here, and to mind nothing else, becomes absolute--London tending rather over-much, moreover, to set frequent and freshly-baited traps, at all times, for a still too susceptible and guileless old country mouse. All my consciousness centres, necessarily, just now, on a single small problem, that of managing to do an [...] "American book" [...] (or rather a couple of them,) that I had supposed myself, in advance, capable of doing on the spot, but that I had there, in fact, utterly to forswear--time, energy, opportunity to write, every possibility quite failing me--with the consequence of my material, my [...] "documents" [...] over here, quite failing me too and there being nothing left for me but to run a race with an illusion, the illusion of still seeing it, which is, as it recedes, so to speak, a thousand lengths ahead of me. I shall keep it up as a tour de force, and produce my copy somehow (I have indeed practically done one vol. of [...] "Impressions"--there are to be two, separate and differently-titled;) but I am unable, meanwhile, to dally by the way--the sweet wayside of Pall Mall--or to turn either to the right or the left. (My subject--unless I grip it tight--melts away--Rye, Sussex, is so little like it; and then where am I? And yet the thing interests me to do, though at the same time appalling me by its difficulty. But I didn't mean to tell you this long story about it.) I hope you are plashing yourself in more pellucid waters--and I find I assume that there is in every way a great increase of the pellucid in your case by the fact of the neighbouring presence of your (as I again, and I trust not fallaciously assume) sympathetic collaterals. I should greatly like, here, a collateral or two myself--to find the advantage, across the sea, of the handful of those of mine who are sympathetic, makes me miss them, or the possibility of them, in this country of my adoption, which is more than kind, but less than kin.... <b>I</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> month of January, further, in this place--then I do seek the metropolis for 12 or 14 weeks. I expect to hear from you that you have carried off some cup or other (sculling for preference) in your Bank Holiday Sports--so for heaven's sake don't disappoint me. You're my one link with the Athletic world, and I {{like to be able to}} talk about you. Therefore, àpropos of cups, all power to your elbow! I know none now--no cup--but the uninspiring cocoa--which I carry with a more and more doddering hand. But I am still, my dear Norris, very lustily and constantly yours, ...|$|E
