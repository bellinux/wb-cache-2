The two most prominent {{security features}} are the engraved portrait of Yusof bin Ishak (which contains fine lines that are difficult for counterfeiters to mimic) and the <b>Kinegram</b> (a printed security hologram); MAS states that banknotes with missing or mutilated portrait or/and <b>Kinegram</b> command no value. Paper versions issued by BCCS features its logo and the face value, while those issued by the MAS features its logo with the Merlion (a mythical creature and national symbol) and the face value. Polymer versions of the banknote have the <b>Kinegram</b> replaced by {{an image of the}} Singapore lion symbol with the face value, showing the coat of arms of Singapore when tilted at varying degrees.|$|E

A hologram security feature known as a <b>Kinegram</b> can also inserted into packaging, bars that contain these are called Kinebars.|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} kinegrams in German and Czech language. It {{is divided into}} two main parts, namely the theoretical and practical part. The former defines the main terminology of phraseological discipline, typical features of phraseologisms and their classification. Additonally, the terms <b>kinegram</b> and confrontational phraseology are described. The practical part is concerned with assigning czech equivalents to the german kinegrams in contrastive phraseology. Consequently, the kinegrams are divided into five groups according to their equivalence. Some of the kinegrams are described in detail with help of contemporary german press...|$|E
