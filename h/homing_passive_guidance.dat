40|$|There is {{evidence}} that experience of the sensory consequences, {{in the absence of}} practice of the required motor commands, is sufficient to learn new bimanual coordination patterns. This was shown through improvements of an incongruent group who practiced a desired 30 ° phase offset between the limbs while 1 limb was weighted such that the desired phase relation was achieved when synchronous motor commands were sent to the limbs (P. Atchy-Delama, P. G. Zanone, C. E. Peper, & P. J. Beek, 2005). In addition to testing a similar incongruent and congruent group (i. e., no weight), the authors extended this experiment by removing visual feedback during practice and by including an auditory modeling and <b>passive</b> <b>guidance</b> group. All groups showed improvement, except for the modeling group. The <b>passive</b> <b>guidance</b> group made more errors in posttests than the congruent and incongruent groups. Only the congruent group increased the amount of time around 30 ° after practice. Active experience of the sensory consequences combined with practice sending appropriate motor commands is the most effective method for learning, even though strategic improvements can be attained without experience of the latter. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R

40|$|Background and Purpose. Robotic {{devices that}} provide <b>passive</b> <b>guidance</b> and {{stabilization}} {{of the legs}} and trunk during treadmill stepping may increase the delivery of locomotor training to subjects with neurological injury. Lower-extremity guidance also may reduce voluntary muscle activity as compared with compliant assistance provided by therapists. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate differences in metabolic costs and lower-limb muscle activity patterns during robotic- and therapist-assisted treadmill walking. Subjects. Twelve ambulatory subjects with motor incomplete spinal cord injury partic-ipated. Methods. In 2 separate protocols, metabolic and electromyographic (EMG) data were collected during standing and stepping on a treadmill with therapist and robotic assistance. During robotic-assisted walking, subjects were asked to match the kinematic trajectories of the device and maximize their effort. During therapist-assisted walking, subjects walked on the treadmill with manual assistance provided as necessary. Results. Metabolic costs and swing-phase hip flexor EMG activity were significantly lower when subjects were asked to match the robotic device trajectories than with therapist-assisted walking. These differences were reduced when subjects were asked to maxi-mize their effort during robotic-assisted stepping, although swing-phase plantar-flexor EMG activity was increased. In addition, during standing prior to therapist- or robotic-assisted stepping, metabolic costs were higher without stabilization from the robotic device. Discussion and Conclusion. Differences in metabolic costs and muscle activity patterns between therapist- and robotic-assisted standing and stepping illustrate the importance of minimizing <b>passive</b> <b>guidance</b> and stabilization provided during step training protocols.

40|$|Traditional {{guidance}} laws with range-to-go {{information or}} time-to-go estimation {{may not be}} implemented in <b>passive</b> <b>homing</b> missiles since <b>passive</b> seekers cannot measure relative range directly.

In the proposed guidance law, two time-varying bias terms are applied to divide the trajectory into initial phase and terminal phase. The initial bias is designed {{as a function of}} LOS rate and look angle to maintain the seeker’s lock-on while the final bias eliminates the deviation between the integral value of angle control bias and the expected bias amount.

5000|$|The Soviets and Vietnamese {{were able}} to adapt {{to some of these}} tactics. The USSR {{upgraded}} the radar several times to improve ECM (electronic counter measures) resistance. They also introduced a <b>passive</b> <b>guidance</b> mode, whereby the tracking radar could lock on the jamming signal itself and guide missiles directly towards the jamming source. This also meant the SAM site's tracking radar could be turned off, which prevented Shrikes from homing in on it. Some new tactics were developed to combat the Shrike. One of them was to point the radar to the side and then turn it off briefly. Since the Shrike was a relatively primitive anti-radiation missile, it would follow the beam away from the radar and then simply crash when it lost the signal (after the radar was turned off). SAM crews could briefly illuminate a hostile aircraft to see if the target was equipped with a Shrike. If the aircraft fired one, the Shrike could be neutralized with the side-pointing technique without sacrificing any S-75s. Another tactic was a [...] "false launch" [...] in which missile guidance signals were transmitted without a missile being launched. This could distract enemy pilots, or even occasionally cause them to drop ordnance prematurely to lighten their aircraft enough to dodge the nonexistent missile.|$|R
