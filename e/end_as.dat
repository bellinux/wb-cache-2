5|$|Owing {{to a lack}} of {{confidence}} in the local currency, the US dollar is widely accepted as a medium of exchange alongside the Somali shilling.

5|$|Another rivalry {{leading up}} to the event was between The Undertaker and Batista over the World Heavyweight Championship. At the Royal Rumble in January, The Undertaker won the 2007 Royal Rumble match. As a result, he was given the right to a title match at WrestleMania for any of WWE's three major championships (ECW World, World Heavyweight, or WWE). On the February 5 episode of Raw, Undertaker teased all three World Champions (Bobby Lashley, Batista, and John Cena). Undertaker then chose World Heavyweight Champion Batista as his {{opponent}} to face at WrestleMania 23. At WrestleMania, The Undertaker defeated Batista to win the World Heavyweight Championship to extend his WrestleMania undefeated streak to 15-0. Their rivalry, however, did not <b>end,</b> <b>as</b> General Manager Theodore Long booked a Last Man Standing match—a match where the first person unable to respond to a ten count by the referee lost—between The Undertaker and Batista at Backlash.|$|E
5|$|Coulson {{returned}} to training in early November before making {{his return to}} action later that month, scoring in a reserve-team match against Grimsby Town. His first-team return came on 22 November 2008 after entering Barnsley's 2–1 defeat away to Preston North <b>End</b> <b>as</b> an 90th-minute substitute. However, a recurrence of his knee injury in January 2009 ruled him out of action {{for the rest of}} 2008–09, which he finished with three appearances. On 16 October 2009, Coulson signed a one-month loan deal with Conference Premier club Chester City, making his debut on 17 October 2009 against Gateshead in a 1–0 home victory. He scored his first goal for Chester on 7 November 2009 in a 3–1 away win over Grays Athletic. After Chester failed in an attempt to extend his loan he {{returned to}} Barnsley in November 2009, having scored one goal from five appearances. However, these were later removed from the records after Chester were expelled from the Football Conference the following February {{as a result of the}} club breaching five league rules.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War Waterloo {{station and}} the nearby Thames bridges were a {{significant}} target for bombing, and there were several near-misses on the station during the London Blitz of 1940–41. Although there were several interruptions to the Necropolis train service owing to enemy action elsewhere on the line, the Necropolis station was undamaged {{during the early stages}} of the bombing campaign. During the night of 16–17 April 1941, in one of the last major air raids on London, this good fortune came to an <b>end.</b> <b>As</b> bombs repeatedly fell on the Waterloo area, the rolling stock parked in the Necropolis siding was burned, and the railway arch connecting the main line to the Necropolis terminus was badly damaged. Multiple incendiary devices and high explosive bombs struck the central section of the terminus building. While the LNC's office building and the station platforms survived, the central section of the station was reduced to rubble. On 11 May 1941 the station was officially declared closed.|$|E
5|$|During the mid-season break, McManus left City to join Frickley Athletic. Instead, Powell signed Jimmy Gooch from Preston North <b>End</b> <b>as</b> his replacement. Gooch, aged 32, {{was more}} {{experienced}} than Smith and so {{took over as}} first-choice goalkeeper {{at the start of}} the 1953–54 season playing the first 20 games. Smith was called up to the first-team in November for a 1–1 draw with Hartlepools United. He remained in the side and played all but two games for the rest of the season, coming back into the team for the final league game of the season against Gateshead as City finished fifth. He kept 11 clean sheets, which included equalling a club best five in consecutive matches as City won a record nine straight games, during which they conceded just one goal.|$|E

5|$|Expanding {{and moving}} out of their {{homeland}} in Scandinavia and northern Germany, the Germanic peoples had lived in today's Poland for several centuries, during which period many of their tribes also migrated out in the southern and eastern directions (see Wielbark culture). With {{the expansion of the}} Roman Empire, the Germanic tribes came under the Roman cultural influence. Some written remarks by Roman authors that are relevant to the developments on Polish lands have been preserved; they provide additional insight when compared with the archeological record. In the <b>end,</b> <b>as</b> the Roman Empire was nearing its collapse and the nomadic peoples invading from the east destroyed, damaged or destabilized the various Germanic cultures and societies, the Germanic people left eastern and central Europe for the safer and wealthier southern and western parts of the European continent.|$|E
5|$|Feige {{stated in}} January 2013 that Ant-Man {{would be part}} of Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and {{indicated}} in May that the screenplay needed to be modified in order to fit into the universe, as the project had been in development before the first Iron Man film. Feige also stated that shooting was slated to begin sometime in 2014, and that casting would begin towards the end of 2013. In July 2013, Wright said that he and Cornish had completed the script for the film and that Marvel allowed him to delay its production so that he could complete The World's <b>End,</b> <b>as</b> that film's producer Eric Fellner was diagnosed with cancer.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the capture}} of Sattelberg, the 2/48th {{continued}} the advance north {{along with the rest}} of the 26th Brigade, pushing on over difficult terrain to Wareo, where they arrived on 8 December. Following this, the Japanese began to fall back to Sio in retreat and the battalion's involvement in combat operations on the peninsula came to an <b>end</b> <b>as</b> troops from the 5th Division arrived to relieve them. In January, the battalion camped around the Dallman River before being withdrawn back to Finschhafen, camping around the Song River. In February 1944, the 2/48th was withdrawn back to Australia along with the 9th Division. Sailing aboard an American Liberty ship, the battalion landed in Brisbane on 20 February, and made camp at Kalinga before personnel marched out for a long period of home leave. During its time in New Guinea, the battalion had suffered 125 casualties, of which 36 were killed, three died of wounds, eight died of illness and 77 were wounded.|$|E
