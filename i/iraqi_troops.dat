5|$|In early June, insurgents began {{advancing}} {{into the}} central and northern parts of Iraq. On 10 June, Mosul fell to ISIL, a devastating defeat given that there were 30,000 <b>Iraqi</b> <b>troops</b> in the city facing approximately 1,500 ISIL fighters. Most of the Iraqi Army soldiers refused to fight and fled.|$|E
5|$|On 18 August 1933, <b>Iraqi</b> <b>troops</b> entered Mosul {{where they}} were given an {{enthusiastic}} reception by its Muslim inhabitants. Triumphant arches were erected and decorated with melons pierced with daggers, symbolising the heads of murdered Assyrians. The crown prince Ghazi himself came {{to the city to}} award 'victorious' colours to those military and tribal leaders who participated in the massacres and the looting.|$|E
5|$|On August 2, 1990, Saddam Hussein sent an invading {{force of}} <b>Iraqi</b> <b>troops</b> into Kuwait. According to the United States {{government}} Hussein's forces would continue south into Saudi Arabia's oil fields. The United States military deployment to Saudi Arabia, Operation Desert Shield, grew rapidly {{to become the}} largest American deployment since the Vietnam War.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} March 2008, the {{situation}} in the city led to an <b>Iraqi</b> <b>troop</b> surge into the city and the 2008 Battle of Basra.|$|R
50|$|The Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force heavily used BL755 cluster {{bombs on}} <b>Iraqi</b> <b>troop</b> and armour {{concentrations}} during the Iran-Iraq War. They were {{carried by the}} F-5E, F-5F, F-4D and F-4E Phantoms.|$|R
50|$|A CNN poll {{conducted}} January 11 found that 32% of 1,093 adults polled 'strongly' or 'moderately' supported a planned increase in <b>Iraqi</b> <b>troop</b> levels, while 66% 'strongly' or 'moderately' opposed the plan. Three percent were unsure. The {{margin of error}} was plus or minus three percent.|$|R
5|$|The summit {{marked a}} shift in Alliance {{priorities}} towards greater involvement in the Middle East, a strategically important region, whose security and stability was regarded as {{closely linked to the}} Euro-Atlantic security. The existing Mediterranean Dialogue (MD) cooperation was broadened, and two new major engagements were launched: the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative (ICI) and a training mission for <b>Iraqi</b> <b>troops.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{the units}} {{moved to the}} Saudi border, many were {{attacked}} by Coalition aircraft. Around the Al-Wafrah forest, about 1,000 Iraqi armored fighting vehicles were attacked by Harrier aircraft with Rockeye cluster bombs. Another Iraqi convoy of armored vehicles was hit by A-10s, which destroyed {{the first and last}} vehicles, before systematically attacking the stranded remainders. Such air raids prevented the majority of the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>troops</b> deployed for the offensive from taking part in it.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, 2nd Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade's 5th Battalion moved {{north of}} Khafji to block Iraqi {{reinforcements}} attempting {{to reach the}} city. This unit was further bolstered by the 8th Ministry of Defense and Aviation Brigade, and heavily aided by Coalition air support. Although fear of friendly fire forced the 8th Ministry of Defense and Aviation Brigade to pull back the following morning, Coalition aircraft successfully hindered Iraqi attempts to move more soldiers down to Khafji and caused large numbers of <b>Iraqi</b> <b>troops</b> to surrender to Saudi forces.|$|E
50|$|In {{preparation}} for Operation Beit ol-Moqaddas, the Iranians had launched numerous air raids against Iraq air bases, destroying 47 jets (including Iraq's brand new Mirage F-1 fighter jets from France); this gave the Iranians air superiority over the battlefield while {{allowing them to}} monitor <b>Iraqi</b> <b>troop</b> movements.|$|R
5000|$|The Iraqi Air Force {{was almost}} {{completely}} obliterated {{in the opening}} stages of the Persian Gulf War (2 August 1990 - 28 February 1991). It lost most of its aircraft, and command and control capability, to precise Coalition strikes and <b>Iraqi</b> <b>troop</b> desertion to Iran. The Iraqis shot down relatively small numbers of opposing American aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|Funded by the Shah, the {{listening}} posts were constructed in Northern Iran by the CIA. After the Iranian Revolution, Iran maintained the facilities in [...] "impeccable condition" [...] despite having {{little or no}} knowledge about how to operate them. With the potential {{to provide information about}} <b>Iraqi</b> <b>troop</b> movements, CIA official George Cave advised Iran's interim government to make use the system.|$|R
5|$|On August 1, 1990, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein {{sent the}} invading Iraqi forces into {{neighboring}} Kuwait, a small petroleum-rich state long claimed by Iraq {{as part of}} its territory. This invasion sparked the initiation of the Persian Gulf War and it brought worldwide condemnation. An estimated 140,000 <b>Iraqi</b> <b>troops</b> quickly took control of Kuwait City and moved on to the Saudi Arabia/Kuwait border. The United States had already begun to develop contingency plans for the defense of Saudi Arabia by the U.S. Central Command, headed by General Norman Schwarzkopf, because of its important petroleum reserves.|$|E
5|$|That night, two U.S. Army heavy {{equipment}} transporters entered {{the city of}} Khafji, apparently lost, and were fired upon by <b>Iraqi</b> <b>troops.</b> Although one truck managed {{to turn around and}} escape, the two drivers of the second truck were wounded and captured. This led to a rescue mission organized by 3rd Battalion 3rd Marine Regiment, which sent a force of 30 men to extract the two wounded drivers. Although encountering no major opposition, they did not find the two drivers who had, by this time, been taken prisoner. The Marines did find a burnt out Kuwaiti AMX-30, with its dead crew. That same night, a U.S. Air Force AC-130 was shot down by an Iraqi surface-to-air missile (SAM), killing the aircraft's crew of 14.|$|E
5|$|Twenty {{years after}} the Falklands {{conflict}} Bravo November saw service in Iraq, being the first British helicopter to land Royal Marines ashore. After departing from , Bravo November landed the first Royal Marines on to the Al-Faw peninsula to seize oil-pumping facilities before <b>Iraqi</b> <b>troops</b> could destroy them. The second DFC for actions at the controls of Bravo November was awarded to Squadron Leader Steve Carr {{for his role in}} an operation in Iraq. Bravo November was tasked with delivering the Marines to the landing sites marked by US special forces before returning for more troops, guns and freight. The aircraft was being flown at an altitude of less than 100ft with restricted visibility due to dust clouds thrown up by American armoured forces.|$|E
2500|$|Rumsfeld {{argues that}} while he was a [...] "latecomer" [...] in {{supporting}} the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>troop</b> 'surge', he still felt open to changing policy. He states that until 2006 Generals Tommy Franks, Ricardo Sanchez, George Casey, and John Abizaid had all assured him that increasing troop levels would not help the situation. Rumsfeld points out that he signed off on General David Petraeus' appointment before his departure.|$|R
50|$|Their {{plane was}} hit by Iraqi anti {{aircraft}} fire {{and they had to}} eject. They were captured by <b>Iraqi</b> ground <b>troops,</b> even though their status was unknown at the time.|$|R
50|$|Baghdad Soldiers, working {{together}} with <b>Iraqi</b> Army <b>troops,</b> discovered two caches totaling approximately 700 lbs. of homemade explosives {{in the early}} morning hours of 15 July 2007 in Operation Purple Haze.|$|R
5|$|During the 1980s these battleships {{made use}} of the RQ-2 Pioneer, an {{unmanned}} aerial vehicle employed in spotting for the guns. Launched from the fantail using a rocket-assist booster that was discarded shortly after takeoff, the Pioneer carried a video camera in a pod under {{the belly of the}} aircraft which transmitted live video to the ship so operators could observe enemy actions or fall of shot during naval gunnery. To land the UAV a large net was deployed {{at the back of the}} ship; the aircraft was flown into it. Missouri and Wisconsin both used the Pioneer UAVs successfully during Operation Desert Storm, and in one particularly memorable incident, a Pioneer UAV operated by Wisconsin received the surrender of <b>Iraqi</b> <b>troops</b> during combat operations. This particular Pioneer was later donated to the Smithsonian Institution, and is now on public display. During Operation Desert Storm these Pioneers were operated by detachments of VC-6. In addition to the Pioneer UAVs, the recommissioned Iowas could support six types of helicopters: the Sikorsky HO3S-1, UH-1 Iroquois, SH-2 Seasprites, CH-46 Sea Knight, CH-53 Sea Stallion and the LAMPS III SH-60B Seahawk.|$|E
5|$|Harith {{advocated}} various reforms, {{the most}} prominent being the full legal equality of the native non-Arab converts (mawali) with the Arab Muslims, echoing a long-standing demand of the former, in conformity with the precepts of Islam. This had been attempted twice before, by the Caliph Umar II (r. 717–720) and by the governors Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri and Ashras ibn Abdallah al-Sulami, but both times the resulting rise in conversions and concomitant drop in revenue (as the numerous mawali {{would not have to}} pay the poll tax) put an end to this, leading to a first rebellion in 728 under Abu al-Sayda' Salih ibn Tarif. Many of the groups and individuals associated with this first uprising would also participate in Harith's movement. Harith was seen as a champion of the rights of the ʿajam (non-Arabs, especially Iranians), many of whom flocked to his banner, but he also had a large following from the disaffected among the Arabs themselves, especially his fellow Tamim and the Azd. Disaffection was widespread among the Khurasani Arabs due to the heavy casualties suffered against the Turgesh at the Battle of the Defile in 731, as well as the dissemination of anti-Umayyad propaganda by proto-Shi'ite groups. This was exacerbated by the resentment felt at the introduction of 20,000 <b>Iraqi</b> <b>troops</b> into the province {{in the aftermath of the}} Defile, and the parallel order of Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (r. 723–743) to disperse the older Arab settlers from Marw to other settlements so as to improve their defence against the Turgesh.|$|E
25|$|The {{offensive}} {{began on}} 24 March 2016, near the Makhmur {{area of the}} Nineveh Province. Thousands of <b>Iraqi</b> <b>troops</b> had been deployed there in the previous weeks, setting up bases alongside Kurdish and US forces. While advancing westward toward the oil town of Qayyarah, <b>Iraqi</b> <b>troops</b> {{were reported to have}} recaptured several villages from ISIL, among them Al-Nasr, Garmandi, Kudila and Khurburdan, though it was later revealed that ISIL was still occupying Al-Nasr and the government forces were trying to capture it.|$|E
50|$|Peshmerga in Iraqi Kurdistan {{said they}} had taken control {{of the city of}} Kirkuk and {{provided}} logistical assistance to <b>Iraqi</b> government <b>troops,</b> during the 2014 Northern Iraq offensive by Sunni militants.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{war against}} Iraq, {{numerous}} Kurdish refugees fled northward from the remaining forces of Saddam Hussein. The United States initiated a vast airlift operation, named Operation Provide Comfort, to drop food and supplies to these refugees concentrated in Iraq along the Turkish border. Because tensions between the Iraqi and Allied forces in the area remained quite high, the 525th was called back to Turkey in April 1991 to protect the vulnerable Allied cargo aircraft. In addition, the 525th was tasked, {{as part of the}} operation, to fly at low altitude over Iraq and provide intelligence updates of <b>Iraqi</b> <b>troop</b> and equipment locations.|$|R
50|$|Following {{turnover}} with , the Battle Group proceeded {{directly to}} the Adriatic to conduct operations in support of Operation Deny Flight and Sharp Guard. In response to aggressive <b>Iraqi</b> <b>troop</b> movements south towards Kuwait, the George Washington Battle Group transited the Suez Canal at maximum speed. Persian Gulf Operations Vigilant and Southern Watch were resumed on 15 October 1994. After Iraqi forces turned north and tensions eased, the Battle Group returned to the Mediterranean Sea. Turnover with the IKE Battle Group took place north of the Suez Canal and the USS George Washington/CVW-7 returned to a rainy Norfolk on 17 November 1994.|$|R
25|$|That same day, <b>Iraqi</b> <b>troops</b> with 1-26th INF {{along with}} 1-14 INF secured the main {{bridge across the}} Tigris River. American forces {{encountered}} insurgents transporting and unloading weapons using speedboats and opened fire, destroying the boats.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, on 15 July, <b>Iraqi</b> <b>troops</b> {{established}} a floating {{bridge over the}} Tigris river south of Mosul, connecting Makhmur to Qayyarah. On 16 July, a large boat carrying more than two tons of explosives {{en route to the}} floating bridge was destroyed completely by a coalition airstrike near Haj Ali village.|$|E
25|$|British 3 Commando Brigade, {{with the}} United States Marine Corps' 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit and the Polish Special Forces unit GROM attached, {{attacked}} {{the port of}} Umm Qasr. There they met with heavy resistance by <b>Iraqi</b> <b>troops.</b> A total of 14 Coalition troops and 30–40 <b>Iraqi</b> <b>troops</b> were killed, and 450 Iraqis taken prisoner. The British Army's 16 Air Assault Brigade also secured the oil fields in southern Iraq in places like Rumaila while the Polish commandos captured offshore oil platforms near the port, preventing their destruction. Despite the rapid advance of the invasion forces, some 44 oil wells were destroyed and set ablaze by Iraqi explosives or by incidental fire. However, the wells were quickly capped and the fires put out, preventing the ecological damage and loss of oil production capacity that had occurred {{at the end of}} the Gulf War.|$|E
50|$|In 1990-91, {{the wing}} {{deployed}} the largest contingent of U-2s ever to Saudi Arabia to support Operation DESERT SHIELD/STORM. The Dragon Lady tracked <b>Iraqi</b> <b>troop</b> and armor buildups, assessed bomb damage, and monitored a massive {{oil spill in}} the Persian Gulf. U-2 pilots alerted ground stations of Scud missile launches and guided fighter aircraft to destroy Scud launchers. After the Gulf War, the U-2 stayed in Saudi Arabia to monitor Iraqi compliance with the peace agreement. In 1998, the Dragon Lady set a weight-to-altitude record and in 1999 won the Collier Trophy, aviation's most coveted award.|$|R
50|$|On 7 November 2006 <b>Iraqi</b> {{government}} <b>troops</b> arrested individuals {{suspected of}} involvement in the kidnap and imprisonment of Norman Kember. The same day, Kember released a statement in which he refused to testify against them.|$|R

25|$|By {{the eve of}} the Invasion of Kuwait {{which led}} to the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the army was {{estimated}} to number 1,000,000 men. Just before the Persian Gulf War began, the force comprised 47 infantry divisions plus 9 armoured and mechanised divisions, grouped in 7 corps. This gave a total of about 56 army divisions, and total land force divisions reached 68 when the 12 Iraqi Republican Guard divisions were included. Although it was said at the time in Western media that <b>Iraqi</b> <b>troops</b> numbered approximately 545,000 (even 600,000) today most experts think that both the qualitative and quantitative descriptions of the Iraqi army at the time were exaggerated, as they included both temporary and auxiliary support elements. Many of the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>troops</b> were also young, under-resourced and poorly trained conscripts. Saddam did not trust the army; among counterbalancing security forces was the Iraqi Popular Army.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 1 October, the Iraqi 36th Commando Battalion seized the Golden Mosque inside the city, {{capturing}} 25 insurgents and uncovering weapons caches. The Golden Mosque is considered the third-holiest shrine in Shia Islam, and any damage to it would have aroused significant controversy. Other <b>Iraqi</b> <b>troops</b> secured the Great Mosque of Samarra, a valued historic and cultural site.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, British forces in Basra {{were faced with}} {{increasing}} restiveness, and became more selective in the areas they patrolled. In all, April, May and early June represented the bloodiest months of fighting {{since the end of}} hostilities. The <b>Iraqi</b> <b>troops</b> who were left in charge of Fallujah after the truce began to disperse and the city fell back under insurgent control.|$|E
50|$|June 18: A suicide truck bomber {{targeted}} <b>Iraqi</b> security <b>troops</b> {{occupying the}} Al Mutawakil school in central Samara. Gunmen also attacked {{the building as}} a diversion, and in total four soldiers and one civilian were killed.|$|R
50|$|The wing's {{most notable}} {{intelligence}} operation took place from August 1990 to March 1991 in Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm. In the largest U-2 deployment ever, the wing flew {{more than 800}} missions over the Persian Gulf region. U‑2s tracked <b>Iraqi</b> <b>troop</b> and armor buildups, assessed bomb damage, and monitored a massive oil spill in the Persian Gulf. U-2 pilots even alerted the anti-missile network of inbound Scud missiles. When the ground war ended and most troops returned home, 9th Wing personnel and the U-2s remained {{in the region to}} help the United Nations verify Iraqi compliance with the terms of the cease‑fire agreement.|$|R
5000|$|Vigilant Warrior. In {{his book}} Against All Enemies, Richard Clarke recounts {{that there was}} a NORAD {{exercise}} ongoing called Vigilant Warrior. The claim is based on a comment that Richard Myers made to Clarke via a video link on September 11, 2001. However, there is no other record of a NORAD exercise named Vigiliant Warrior. Myers was possibly referring to Vigilant Guardian (the aforementioned yearly NORAD exercise held in conjunction with Global Guardian) or Amalgam Warrior (a large-scale, live-fly, CINCNORAD sponsored exercise which is held twice annually). Vigilant Warrior was also a 1994 operation by the US army in the Persian Gulf region, in response to <b>Iraqi</b> <b>troop</b> movements towards Kuwait.|$|R
