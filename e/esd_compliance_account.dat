40|$|This study {{examines}} <b>accounting</b> <b>compliance</b> using an agency theory framework through {{an analysis of}} 220 non-financial Indonesian listed companies’ 2006 annual reports. The level of regulatory compliance is measured using a 29 item index derived from the specific requirements of the Indonesian accounting standards (PSAK) on inventory, fixed assets, and depreciation. The key dependent variable is the aggregate compliance (IARCagg) with further sub-analysis conducted on measurement and disclosure rules and each individual standard. The findings reveal that only 60. 61 % of accounting regulation rules are followed by Indonesian companies. Measurement rules demonstrate higher compliance than disclosure. Depreciation rules have very high compliance with inventory and fixed assets much lower. Consistently, historical cost topics are far better addressed than fair market value themes. Regression analysis demonstrates that size of firm and return on assets are statistically significant predictors of IARC. Bigger and more profitable companies have far higher <b>compliance</b> with <b>accounting</b> rules. This is consistent with prior <b>accounting</b> <b>compliance</b> studies (Nichols and Street, 2007). Of special interest are the findings that corporate governance and ownership structure {{do not appear to}} explain <b>accounting</b> regulatory <b>compliance</b> in an Indonesian context.

A study was done to determine the possibility of financial gain by means of share price prosperity {{as a result of}} <b>compliance</b> with environmental <b>accounting</b> principles. Objective: To investigate the relationship between the commitment to environmental accounting principles and the share price of Main Board listed companies on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Design: A quantitative, cross-sectional design with descriptive, explanatory and contextual elements was undertaken. Setting and Sample: An all-inclusive sample of the announcements of the Main Board listed companies of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange between 1 June 2008 and 1 June 2013 was used, as well as a stratified random sample of 32 companies – 16 as listed on the SRI Index and 16 not. Measurements: Data related to <b>compliance</b> with environmental <b>accounting</b> principles were correlated with share price fluctuations of Main Board listed companies. T-tests were done to determine whether a correlation exists between <b>compliance</b> with environmental <b>accounting</b> principles and fluctuations in share price. Results: 56 instances of upward trends and 80 instances of downward trends after one month followed announcements that included <b>compliance</b> to environmental <b>accounting</b> principles (one constant and one unknown). 52 instances of upward trends and 54 instances of downward trends after one year followed these announcements (30 unknown). 48 out of 336 listed companies (14 %) announce environmental <b>accounting</b> principle <b>compliance</b> with their shareholders. More announcements referring to environmental <b>accounting</b> <b>compliance</b> were posted in 2012 and 2013 (n = 17 and n = 22 averaged for six months) compared to those in 2008 to 2011 (n = 9; n = 15; n = 14 and n = 15 averaged for six months). 56 % of companies complying with environmental accounting principles are from the mining industry. 39. 19 % of principles complied with was within the diverse principle division. P-values derived from t-tests done to investigate correlations between share price and <b>compliance</b> with environmental <b>accounting</b> principles on various levels all revealed P-values of more than 0. 25. Conclusions: No statistically significant correlation could be made between <b>compliance</b> with environmental <b>accounting</b> principles and fluctuations in share price. There is low divulgence of compliance practices to shareholders from mentioned companies. An upward trend for <b>compliance</b> with environmental <b>accounting</b> principles is noted during the past five years.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this paper}} is to explore the causes of {{variations}} in financial accounting and disclosure practices in a municipal setting highly influenced by governance reforms - the Swedish municipal waste management sector. This focus is motivated by the claim that recent governance reforms have made the organization of public services delivery more diversified and fragmented, which may have had a negative effect on transparency and accountability. Design/methodology/approach: To document the accounting and disclosure practices of the Swedish solid waste management organizations, a questionnaire approach was selected. The study uses a conceptual theoretical framework that complements the basic variables considered to influence public sector financial accounting and disclosure practices with factors such as competition and municipal governance forms. Findings: The results show that <b>compliance</b> <b>accounting</b> and disclosure transparency to some extent have different antecedents and that the external environment, including market competition, size and economic input, influences both. The governance forms, on the other hand, only influenced <b>compliance</b> <b>accounting</b> (negatively and positively) and not the willingness to disclose information in general. The overall conclusion is that changes to the economic and institutional context mixed with different municipal governance forms introduces a multiplicity of forces that makes the accounting practices themselves diversified and fragmented and not necessarily only in a "negative" direction. Practical implications: From a policy perspective the results indicate that the changing institutional and organizational environment has not been matched by attention to, and regulation of, reporting structures that secure external vertical accountability processes. The general implication for future regulations should therefore be to recognize the influence of different economic and institutional forces and develop accountability models that enable and preserve the benefits of governance reform initiatives without losing accountability and transparency. Originality/value: Few prior quantitative studies have theoretically related municipal accounting and disclosure practices to factors such as market competition and popular municipal governance forms (municipal corporation, regional cooperation, outsourcing, etc.). Knowledge of how reforms might influence municipal accounting practices might benefit future policy decisions on accountability models with aim of enable and preserve the benefits of governance reform initiatives without losing accountability and transparency...|$|R
