500|$|Marc Hirsh of The Boston Globe listed [...] "The Only Exception" [...] as the {{highlight}} of Brand New Eyes, crediting the song as being an [...] "essential". Hirsh said that [...] "The Only Exception" [...] is [...] "probably {{the best place to}} start" [...] with the album, describing Williams' vocals as [...] "forging a connection" [...] rather than [...] "simply spitting out her feelings"; he also praised the other band members for locking in at a [...] "sympathetic simmer". Channing Freeman of Sputnikmusic felt that [...] "The Only Exception" [...] had similarities to [...] "The Boy Who Blocked His Own Shot" [...] by Brand New. Freeman stated that on Paramore's All We Know Is Falling, [...] "My Heart" [...] was a [...] "blunt and obvious song" [...] that focused on a [...] "climax to be emotional", but with [...] "The Only Exception", Paramore have [...] "figured out that it doesn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> loud to incite a reaction in the listener". He also noted that the song shows that Williams' lyrics have [...] "definitely improved". Jesse Catalodo of Slant felt that the lyrics to [...] "The Only Exception" [...] may be [...] "irredeemably over-the-top" [...] but its [...] "vocal melodies are the stuff of perfect pop".|$|E

He went on to finish 3rd behind Jenson Button and Sebastian Vettel. A week later at [...] at Monza, Räikkönen qualified 7th and finished the race in 5th. At the , Räikkönen qualified 12th as his Lotus E20 couldn't match {{the pace of the}} top 3 teams and eventually finished 6th.

The [...] saw the {{introduction of a}} coanda style exhaust system and several other minor updates to the Lotus E20 which, Lotus team boss Éric Boullier regarded as a new era in his team's development race. Räikkönen eventually qualified 5th and finished the race in 5th after an impressive battle with McLaren's Lewis Hamilton which ended in Räikkönen's favour. Even though he was 48 points behind the championship leader Sebastian Vettel after 16 rounds of the [...] season, Räikkönen said he takes inspiration from the [...] season which he won at the last round in Brazil after McLaren's Lewis Hamilton suffered gearbox problems. At the , Räikkönen qualified in 7th place. He couldn't manage to improve his starting position {{because of a lack of}} top speed on the straights. After this race, the contract with Lotus was extended for [...] due to the fact that the terms of options in the contract have been met. On 4 November 2012, Räikkönen won his first race for the Lotus F1 team at the [...] after a good start from fourth saw him take Pastor Maldonado and Mark Webber at the first corner. He was unable to match the pace of Hamilton, but a mechanical issue retired the McLaren and allowed Räikkönen to win the race, despite pressure from the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso in the closing stages. Although he was now mathematically eliminated from the championship as a result of Vettel finishing 3rd, the Lotus name celebrated its first win since the 1987 Detroit Grand Prix which was won by Ayrton Senna. Still third, Räikkönen was 16 points clear of Lewis Hamilton in the championship. But after Hamilton's pole position at the concluding race of 2012, Räikkönen would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> at least fifth in the race if Hamilton were to win. He qualified only ninth. On lap 52, Räikkönen, who had been in-and-out of the points frequently, made a mistake and went off the track and tried to use an escape road to re-enter the track rather than drive over the grass. The road was blocked and he was forced to turn back. He lost numerous places and found himself behind a Caterham and a Marussia. He skidded again to be lapped, but re-claimed the lost places and with a retirement from Hamilton, finished the race in 10th and claimed his 3rd place in the standings, with a 1-point contribution to the tally. He ended the season 71 points behind Fernando Alonso and 74 points behind champion Sebastian Vettel.|$|E
