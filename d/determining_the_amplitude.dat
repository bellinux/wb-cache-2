50|$|Samples {{in digital}} audio are {{recorded}} as integers or floating-point numbers stored in digital memory. Those numbers are encoded using {{a series of}} on and off memory bits. The larger the number of bits, the more accurately a sample encodes the instantaneous volume level of a sampled audio waveform. DAWs today typically use 32-bit floating-point numbers, {{because they are more}} suitable for successive layered processing and mixing, but the final master output usually consists of 16-bit or 24-bit integer samples. Early digital audio gear and video games used 8-bit integer samples or less. Roland's classic TR-909 drum machine used 6-bit integer samples. The number of bits used in each sample directly affects the signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range of the digital signal, specifically by <b>determining</b> <b>the</b> <b>amplitude</b> of a kind of noise called quantization noise that is similar to low-pass-filtered white noise.|$|E
50|$|Neurotransmitter release can be {{measured}} by <b>determining</b> <b>the</b> <b>amplitude</b> of the postsynaptic potential after triggering an action potential in the presynaptic neuron. Measuring neurotransmitter release this way can be problematic because {{the effect of the}} postsynaptic neuron to the same amount of released neurotransmitter can change over time. Another way is to measure vesicle fusion with the presynaptic membrane directly using a patch pipette. A cell membrane {{can be thought of as}} a capacitor in that positive and negative ions are stored on both sides of the membrane. The larger the area of membrane the more ions that are necessary to hold the membrane at a certain potential. In electrophysiology this means that a current injection into the terminal will take less time to charge a membrane to a given potential before vesicle fusion than it will after vesicle fusion. The time course to charge the membrane to a potential and the resistance of the membrane is measured and with these values the capacitance of the membrane can be calculated by the equation Tau/Resistance=Capacitance. With this technique researchers can measure synaptic vesicle release directly by measuring increases in the membrane capacitance of the presynaptic terminal.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{important}} factors for <b>determining</b> <b>the</b> <b>amplitude</b> of the P3a include habituation and target discrimination. One {{major difference between}} the P3b and the P3a is that only the P3a habituates with repeated presentation. The habituation indicates {{that some sort of}} memory encoding for the event has been created, and for this reason the event no longer generates a response when repeated. Each time a novel event is experienced, it is compared to the previously created neural representation, and, if it is sufficiently deviant, then the process begins again. If this event is not sufficiently deviant (i.e., it is the same) then habituation occurs. The P3a's rapid amplitude reduction with exposure to repeated trials of novel stimuli supports the idea that the P3a is the electrophysiological representation of the orienting response (which also habituates in behavior). [...] For example, Grillon and colleagues used a 3 stimulus odd-ball paradigm wherein they presented subjects with a condition in which the deviant stimuli were constant and a condition in which the deviant stimuli were always novel. Their results showed the largest P3a amplitude in response to deviant stimuli that were novel.|$|E

40|$|Background] A {{complete}} set is a minimum set of observables which {{allows one to}} <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> underlying reaction <b>amplitudes</b> unambiguously. Pseudoscalar-meson photoproduction from the nucleon is characterized by four such amplitudes and {{complete set}}s involve single- and double-polarization observables. [Purpose] Identify complete sets of observables, and study how measurements with finite error bars impact their potential to <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> reaction <b>amplitudes</b> unambiguously. [Method] <b>The</b> authors provide arguments to employ the transversity representation in order to <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>amplitudes</b> in pseudoscalar-meson photoproduction. It is studied whether <b>the</b> <b>amplitudes</b> in <b>the</b> transversity basis for the γ p → K^+Λ reaction can be estimated without ambiguity. To this end, data from the GRAAL collaboration and mock data from a realistic model are analyzed. [Results] It is illustrated that the moduli of normalized transversity amplitudes can be determined from precise single-polarization data. Starting from mock data with achievable experimental resolution, it is quite likely to obtain imaginary solutions for the relative phases of <b>the</b> <b>amplitudes.</b> Also <b>the</b> real solutions face a discrete phase ambiguity which {{makes it impossible to}} obtain a statistically significant solution for the relative phases at realistic experimental conditions. [Conclusions] Single polarization observables are effective in <b>determining</b> <b>the</b> moduli of <b>the</b> <b>amplitudes</b> in a transversity basis. <b>Determining</b> <b>the</b> relative phases of <b>the</b> <b>amplitudes</b> from double-polarization observables is far less evident.
