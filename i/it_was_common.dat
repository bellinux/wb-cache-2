5|$|According to Pentecostal biblical interpretation, the Gospel of John 20:22 {{shows that}} the disciples of Jesus were already born again before the Holy Spirit fell at Pentecost. They then cite biblical {{examples}} in the Book of Acts 2, 8, 10, and 19 to show that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>common</b> in the New Testament for Spirit baptism to occur after conversion. In following the biblical pattern, they argue, Christians today should also pray for this baptism which results in greater power for ministry and witness.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>common</b> to bury dogs {{in ancient}} Egypt, {{the funeral of}} Abuwtiyuw was unusually elaborate, an honour {{normally}} reserved for upper-class humans. The pharaoh's gifts suggest that the corpse was mummified, as was commonly done with humans at the time, {{in the belief that}} the Ka of the dead would enter into its afterlife through the ceremonial burial.|$|E
5|$|As {{the islands}} have no {{harbours}} or anchorages, the phosphate ships were loaded by securing to deep moorings and embarking their cargo via cantilever jetties. During south-westerly wind periods—which are common from November to March—the ships {{had to stop}} loading and sail away from the island until conditions improved. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>common</b> for these ships {{to be allowed to}} drift to save fuel, and there were often several vessels lying off Nauru.|$|E

5|$|Even though peasant {{households}} {{were significantly}} smaller than aristocratic ones, the wealthiest of these would also employ servants. Service {{was a natural}} part of the cycle of life, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>common</b> for young people to spend some years away from home in the service of another household. This way they would learn the skills needed later in life, {{and at the same time}} earn a wage. This was particularly useful for girls, who could put the earnings towards their dowry.|$|E
5|$|Even without {{managerial}} manipulation, quotas {{were very}} often low {{and easy to}} overfulfill. Quotas had been lowered during the Second World War so that new workers {{would be able to}} fulfill their output expectations; in industries such as engineering, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>common</b> for workers to double their basic pay through bonuses.|$|E
5|$|Harold Oliver {{was born}} to Cornish {{immigrants}} James Oliver and Sarah Mill in the gold mining town of Waukaringa. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>common</b> for Cornish people, where mining was a key industry, to move to Australia and use their knowledge to attempt a better life as the economy in Cornwall was waning. During Oliver's childhood in the 1890s the town was home to 600 people. Today it is a ghost town.|$|E

5|$|Hesketh-Prichard {{was shocked}} to learn of the high {{attrition}} rate due to well-trained German snipers. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>common</b> for British regiments to lose five men a day to snipers; he learned that one battalion lost eighteen in a single day. The German snipers could not be located, leaving them free to continue shooting from their place of concealment. He was also dismayed by the poor quality of marksmanship amongst the British troops.|$|E
5|$|In Ancient Rome {{people did}} not eat or drink with the same pottery as that used by someone who was {{affected}}. People of the time would spit on their chest believing that this would keep the problem from affected them. According to Apuleius and other ancient physicians, in order detect epilepsy <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>common</b> to light a piece of gagates, whose smoke would trigger the seizure. Occasionally a spinning potter's wheel was used, perhaps a reference to photosensitive epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 13thcentury, Crusader castles were mostly built by Military Orders {{including}} the Knights Hospitaller, Knights Templar, and Teutonic Knights.

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>common</b> {{practice}} for crews' wages {{to be stopped}} when a ship was sunk. Famed Labour leader James Larkin {{raised the issue of}} the survivors' treatment in the Dáil Éireann. Citing the crew member who was told by the Labour exchange to 'go and get his record card', which was lost when Irish Oak sank, he suggested that the Dáil Éireann ask the German Consul-General to send a submarine to retrieve it.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>common</b> {{practice}} for ore freighters, even in foul weather, to embark with not all cargo clamps locked {{in place on}} the hatch covers. Maritime author Wolff reported that depending on weather conditions, all the clamps were eventually set within one to two days. Captain Paquette of Wilfred Sykes was dismissive of suggestions that unlocked hatch clamps caused Fitzgerald to founder. He said that he commonly sailed in fine weather using the minimum number of clamps necessary to secure the hatch covers.|$|E
5|$|Minor {{changes were}} made to the track on 22 February 2010 after {{bobsleigh}} four-man teams from Latvia and Croatia rolled over in supplementary practice. Following a meeting with 11 team captains, practice runs were postponed by the FIBT until later that day to adjust the shape of turn 11 so it would be easier for sleds to get {{through the rest of the}} track without crashing. FIBT spokesman Don Krone also stated that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>common</b> that turn profiles were changed when it was being used by other sliding disciplines such as luge and skeleton.|$|E

50|$|Although such {{intermediate}} implementations do {{not require}} units of currency (e.g., dollars), <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>common</b> practice to use budgeted dollars as the scale for PV and EV. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> also <b>common</b> practice to track labor hours in parallel with currency. The following EVM formulas are for schedule management, and {{do not require}} accumulation of actual cost (AC). This <b>is</b> important because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>common</b> in small and intermediate size projects for true costs to be unknown or unavailable.|$|R
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} differences between proto-globalization and archaic globalization was the switch from inter-nation trading of rarities to the trading of commodities. During the 12th and 13th centuries <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>common</b> to trade items that were foreign and rare to different cultures. A popular trade during archaic globalization involved European merchants sailing to areas of India or China in order to purchase luxury items such as porcelain, silk and spices. Traders of the pre-modern period also traded drugs and certain foods such as sugar cane and other crops.|$|E

5|$|When {{referring}} to the language, the name is normally capitalized (Perl) as a proper noun.

Schwartz, however, capitalized the language's name in the book to make it stand out better when typeset. This case distinction was subsequently documented as canonical.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the ideal}} ages for {{marriage}} were thirty {{for a man}} and twenty for a woman, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>common</b> for a male to marry at age sixteen and a female at age fourteen. To encourage families to marry off their daughters, a law was introduced in 189 BCE that increased the poll tax rate fivefold for unmarried {{women between the ages}} of fifteen and thirty. People of the Han practiced a strict form of exogamy where one could not marry a person who had the same surname, even if both partners could not be traced back to a common ancestor (however, this excluded the royal family, who sometimes married distant relatives for political reasons). Officials often married into families with officials of equal status and sometimes married royal princesses or had their daughters marry kings and even the emperor.|$|E
5|$|Born on 16 November 1945 in Brussels, van Hamel was the {{youngest}} of three siblings of Dutch parents. Her father, Diederik (Dick) Alfred van Hamel, was a diplomat stationed in Copenhagen. Her mother, Manette van Hamel (née Cramer), born in 1913 in Deventer, was a music teacher and violinist who played in a string quartet. Martine van Hamel began ballet lessons at the age of four in Copenhagen where <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>common</b> for children to study ballet. As a diplomat, her father was routinely stationed in different countries such as Denmark, the Netherlands, and Indonesia. It was difficult for her to find teachers but she took lessons when possible. While her father was stationed in Caracas, Venezuela, van Hamel, then age ten, took classes with Henry Danton from The Royal Ballet. Danton frequently guest taught at the National Ballet of Venezuela. In 1958, she moved to Canada to study at Canada's National Ballet School with Betty Oliphant.|$|E
