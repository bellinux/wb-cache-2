Improvising a code using a series of specific golf-course holes to guide him through the mine fields sown to protect him and to get him to the Song Meiu Giang, they radioed him, [...] "You're going to play 18 holes and you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> the Swanee and make like Esther Williams and Charlie the Tuna.

500|$|When the First World War {{began in}} August 1914, Emmeline and Christabel {{considered}} {{that the threat}} posed by Germany was a danger to all humanity, and that the British government needed the support of all citizens. They persuaded the WSPU to halt all militant suffrage activities until fighting on the European mainland ended. It was no time for dissent or agitation; Christabel wrote later: [...] "This was national militancy. As Suffragists we could not be pacifists at any price." [...] A truce with the government was established, all WSPU prisoners were released, and Christabel returned to London. Emmeline and Christabel set the WSPU into motion on behalf of the war effort. In her first speech after returning to Britain, Christabel warned of the [...] "German Peril". She urged the gathered women to follow the example of their French sisters, who – while the men fought – [...] "are able to keep the country <b>going,</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> the harvest, to carry on the industries". Emmeline urged men to volunteer for the front lines.|$|E

500|$|Davis toured relentlessly for {{two years}} while tolerating intense {{physical}} pain and difficulty walking, caused by joint pain from sickle-cell anaemia, badly damaged ankles after a 1972 car wreck, and osteoporosis in his left hip, which had been operated on a decade earlier. He had also developed nodules on his larynx that often left him short of breath, especially when playing the trumpet. To numb the pain, he became increasingly dependent on self-medicating with painkillers, cocaine, and morphine, which combined with his alcohol and recreational drug use led to mood swings; he would by turns feel vulnerable and hostile. By the end of 1974, a disappointing showing in Down Beat magazine's readers poll reinforced to Davis that his reputation had diminished. Unfazed by detractors and personal troubles, he kept his touring schedule intense. [...] "He was like the general looking at the fort {{and they had a}} moat and we were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> that fort", Henderson later said. [...] "That was the attitude of the band. We didn't give a shit what the critics said. People are gonna like what they like, but if you don't like it, respect it. Respect that I {{have the right to do}} what I do. Because with or without you, we're going to do it anyway." ...|$|E

At that time the club had no black members.|$|E

[...] He also reportedly offered cocaine to a taxi driver.|$|E

2500|$|For {{his first}} year in the soap, little was known about the character's background, which Swash commented on in an {{interview}} with the Sunday Mirror in February 2004: [...] "It's weird because we don't know anything about Mickey's background. I was filming Kat and Alfie's wedding and I thought, 'Hang on, where's my family? Why have I abandoned them on Christmas Day to go to some wedding?' But I'm sure it'll all become clear.

2500|$|While incarcerated at the Stateville Correctional Center in Crest Hill, Illinois, Speck {{was given}} the {{nickname}} [...] "birdman" [...] after the film Birdman of Alcatraz, because he kept a pair of sparrows that had flown into his cell. He {{was described as a}} loner who kept a stamp collection and enjoyed listening to music. His contacts with the warden included requests for new shirts, radio and other mundane items. The warden merely described him as [...] "a big nothing doing time." [...] Speck was not a model prisoner; he was often caught with drugs or distilled moonshine. Punishment for such infractions never stopped him. [...] "How am I <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> trouble? I'm here for 1,200 years!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Hedrick caused {{controversy}} when {{he insisted}} Shani Davis, fellow American speed skater in the 1,000m race, should {{have participated in}} the men's pursuit, stating, [...] "I don't see what his logic is. We can't be beat if he skates. It's his decision. I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> the middle of it. I would like him to be in the pursuit, but am I going to beg him? No." [...] Five-time gold medalist and Olympic-team physician, Eric Heiden, has publicly written that Davis made the right choice in not participating in the team pursuit and thereby not jeopardizing his chances at a gold medal in his best event, the 1,000 meter race. Davis eventually won the gold medal in the 1000 m race, while Hedrick finished sixth.|$|E
2500|$|On December 7, 1980, Taylor had an {{encounter}} with Mark David Chapman, who would assassinate John Lennon just one day later. Taylor told the BBC in 2010: [...] "The guy had sort of pinned me {{to the wall and}} was glistening with maniacal sweat and talking some freak speak about {{what he was going to}} do and his stuff with how John was interested, and he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> touch with John Lennon. And it was surreal to actually have contact with the guy 24 hours before he shot John." [...] The next night, Taylor, who lived in the next building from Lennon, heard the assassination occur. Taylor commented: [...] "I heard him shot—five, just as quick as you could pull the trigger, about five explosions." ...|$|E
2500|$|On Saturday, February 11, {{the lineup}} for Team USA was announced. Hedrick would skate with Mull and Leveille for the {{preliminary}} races, reserving veteran Olympians Boutiette and Parra for the finals.

Much of the criticism towards Davis was from Hedrick himself. Two days before the official announcement, Hedrick stated, [...] "I don't see what his logic is. We can't be beat if he skates. It's his decision. I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> the middle of it. I would like him to be in the pursuit, but am I going to beg him? No." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Abbott {{brothers}} officially {{broke up}} Pantera in 2003, also {{the year when}} their [...] was released (on September 23), when the Abbott brothers concluded that Anselmo had abandoned Pantera and would not return. The break-up of the band was not amicable and subsequently a war of words was waged between the former bandmates via the heavy metal and musical press. The Abbott brothers and Pantera crew members claimed that they tried numerous times to contact Anselmo over the phone to reorganize Pantera, but Anselmo maintains that they never called him. Caught up in the torrent was Rex Brown, who later said [...] "It {{was a bunch of}} he said, she said nonsense that was going on, and I wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> the middle of it." [...] Anselmo's comment in a 2004 issue of Metal Hammer magazine saying that [...] "Dimebag deserves to be beaten severely" [...] typified Pantera's internal conflicts; Anselmo insists that this comment was tongue-in-cheek, and he was angered his comment ended up {{on the cover of the}} [...] "god damn" [...] magazine. This explanation was soon dismissed by Vinnie Paul, who said shortly after the 2004 murder of his brother that he had personally listened to the audio files of the interview and that Anselmo had not been misquoted or misrepresented, but said the exact words which appeared in the article. In July 2004, Vulgar Display of Power went double-platinum, and The Great Southern Trendkill went platinum the next month.|$|E
2500|$|Brando starred as Colonel Walter E. Kurtz in Francis Ford Coppola's Vietnam epic Apocalypse Now (1979). He plays {{a highly}} {{decorated}} U.S. Army Special Forces officer who goes renegade, running his own operation based in Cambodia and is feared by the U.S. military {{as much as}} the Vietnamese. Brando was paid $1million a week for 3 weeks work. The film drew attention for its lengthy and troubled production, as Eleanor Coppola's documentary Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse documents: Brando showed up on the set overweight, Martin Sheen suffered a heart attack, and severe weather destroyed several expensive sets. The film's release was also postponed several times while Coppola edited millions of feet of footage. In the documentary, Coppola talks about how astonished he was when an overweight Brando turned up for his scenes and, feeling desperate, decided to portray Kurtz, who appears emaciated in the original story, as a man who had indulged every aspect of himself. Coppola: [...] "He was already heavy when I hired him and he promised me that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> shape and I imagined that I would, if he were heavy, I could use that. But he was so fat, he was very, very shy about it... He was very, very adamant about how he didn't want to portray himself that way." [...] Brando admitted to Coppola that he had not read the book, Heart of Darkness, as the director had asked him to, and the pair spent days exploring the story and the character of Kurtz, much to the actor's financial benefit, according to producer Fred Roos: [...] "The clock was ticking on this deal he had and we had to finish him within three weeks or we'd go into this very expensive overage... And Francis and Marlon would be talking about the character and whole days would go by. And this is at Marlon's urging—and yet he's getting paid for it." ...|$|E
