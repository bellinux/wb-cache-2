5|$|After 1963 Blyton's output was {{generally}} confined to {{short stories and}} books intended <b>for</b> <b>very</b> young readers, such as Learn to Count with Noddy and Learn to Tell Time with Noddy in 1965, and Stories for Bedtime and the Sunshine Picture Story Book collection in 1966. Her declining health and a falling off in readership among older children have been put forward as the principal reasons for this change in trend. Blyton published her last book in the Noddy series, Noddy and the Aeroplane, in February 1964. In May the following year she published Mixed Bag, a song book with music written by her nephew Carey, and in August she released her last full-length books, The Man Who Stopped to Help and The Boy Who Came Back.|$|E

5|$|Cacti were {{cultivated}} as ornamental {{plants from}} the time they were first brought from the New World. By the early 1800s, enthusiasts in Europe had large collections (often including other succulents alongside cacti). Rare plants were sold <b>for</b> <b>very</b> high prices. Suppliers of cacti and other succulents employed collectors to obtain plants from the wild, in addition to growing their own. In the late 1800s, collectors turned to orchids, and cacti became less popular, although never disappearing from cultivation.|$|E
5|$|During the 1870s the {{distinction}} grew between 'first-class ironclads' or 'battleships' {{on the one}} hand, and 'cruising ironclads' designed for long-range work on the other. The demands on first-class ironclads <b>for</b> <b>very</b> heavy armor and armament meant increasing displacement, which reduced speed under sail; and the fashion for turrets and barbettes made a sailing rig increasingly inconvenient. , launched in 1876 but not commissioned until 1881, was the last British battleship to carry masts, and these were widely seen as a mistake. The start of the 1880s saw the end of sailing rig on ironclad battleships.|$|E

5|$|From a {{strategic}} point of view, by defending Thermopylae, the Greeks {{were making the}} best possible use of their forces. As {{long as they could}} prevent a further Persian advance into Greece, they had no need to seek a decisive battle and could, thus, remain on the defensive. Moreover, by defending two constricted passages (Thermopylae and Artemisium), the Greeks' inferior numbers became less of a factor. Conversely, for the Persians the problem of supplying such a large army meant they could not remain in the same place <b>for</b> <b>very</b> long. The Persians, therefore, had to retreat or advance, and advancing required forcing the pass of Thermopylae.|$|E

5|$|In high-mass main-sequence stars, the opacity is {{dominated}} by electron scattering, which is nearly constant with increasing temperature. Thus the luminosity only increases as the cube of the star's mass. For stars below 10 , the opacity becomes dependent on temperature, resulting in the luminosity varying approximately as the fourth power of the star's mass. <b>For</b> <b>very</b> low-mass stars, molecules in the atmosphere {{also contribute to the}} opacity. Below about 0.5 , the luminosity of the star varies as the mass to the power of 2.3, producing a flattening of the slope on a graph of mass versus luminosity. Even these refinements are only an approximation, however, and the mass-luminosity relation can vary depending on a star's composition.|$|E
5|$|In prokaryotes, {{transcription}} {{occurs in}} the cytoplasm; <b>for</b> <b>very</b> long transcripts, translation may begin at the 5'end of the RNA while the 3'end is still being transcribed. In eukaryotes, transcription {{occurs in the}} nucleus, where the cell's DNA is stored. The RNA molecule produced by the polymerase {{is known as the}} primary transcript and undergoes post-transcriptional modifications before being exported to the cytoplasm for translation. One of the modifications performed is the splicing of introns which are sequences in the transcribed region that do not encode protein. Alternative splicing mechanisms can result in mature transcripts from the same gene having different sequences and thus coding for different proteins. This is a major form of regulation in eukaryotic cells and also occurs in some prokaryotes.|$|E
