5|$|Head I, {{completed}} late in 1948, {{is considered}} {{more successful than}} Head II. Although it is well-regarded critically, Head II is seen {{as something of a}} creative cul-de-sac, while Heads III, IV and V are usually considered as merely intermediate steps towards HeadVI. It is exceptional in Bacon's oeuvre that works of their relative poor quality survive; he was ruthlessly self-critical and often slashed or abandoned canvasses before they were completed. When pressed again by Brausen in 1953 to produce works for a New York show that she had been publicising for a year, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>full</b> of doubt and destroyed most of what he had been working on, including several other popes.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, {{his boat}} shipwrecked in the Río de la Plata, between Argentina and Uruguay. He survived by {{clinging}} to a wooden part of the boat, while around him 80 passengers died. Later on, while {{on a trip to}} Algiers, he showed the pocket knife, which had enabled him to survive this ordeal. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>full</b> of gratitude also for the children lodged at an orphanage, and asked the cardinal archbishop of Algiers, Léon-Etienne Duval, to help out the orphanage (or Kasbah).|$|E
25|$|Neither {{the success}} at Uman nor what {{followed}} at Kiev {{would have happened}} had Rundstedt not backed his subordinates and resisted Hitler's interference {{in the conduct of}} the campaign. As during the French campaign, Hitler was panicked by his own success. By early July <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>full</b> of anxiety that the German armour was advancing too quickly, without infantry support, and that it was exposed to Soviet counter-attacks. On 10 July Brauchitsch arrived at Rundstedt's headquarters at Brody, with instructions from Hitler that Kleist was turn south towards Vinnitsa and link up with Schobert's army there, rather than continue south-east to Kirovograd. This would still have trapped many Soviet divisions, but it would have allowed the mass of Soviet forces at Uman and Kiev to escape. Rundstedt defended Kleist's ability to execute the larger encirclement, and persuaded Brauchitsch that he was right. Brauchitsch then contacted Halder, who succeeded in persuading Hitler to support Rundstedt. This was a sign that Rundstedt still had Hitler's respect, as were Hitler's two visits to Rundstedt's armies during this period.|$|E

25|$|In 1841 James David Forbes, {{professor}} of natural philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, {{came to see}} the Matterhorn. A philosopher and geologist, and an observant traveller, he continued the work of De Saussure in his journeys and his writings. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>full</b> of admiration for the Matterhorn, calling it the most wonderful peak in the Alps, unsealed and unscalable. These words, pronounced by a man noted among all his contemporaries for his thorough knowledge of mountains, show what men's feelings then were towards the Matterhorn, and how {{at a time when the}} idea of Alpine exploration was gaining ground in their minds, the Matterhorn stood by itself as a mountain apart, of whose conquest it was vain even to dream. And such it remained till long after this; as such it was described by John Ball twenty years later in his celebrated guide-book. Forbes ascended the Theodul Pass in 1842, climbed the Breithorn, and came down to Breuil; as he descended from the savage scenery of the Matterhorn, the Italian landscapes of the Valtournanche seemed to him like paradise. Meanwhile Gottlieb Samuel Studer, the geographer, together with Melchior Ulrich, was describing and mapping the topographical features of the Zermatt peaks.|$|E
25|$|England {{obviously}} {{needed to}} do something to maintain their hold on the Ashes and three changes were made to the team. The first was forced as Godfrey Evans had broken his middle finger and the reserve wicket-keeper Roy Swetman made his Test debut. This was not so much of a loss as first thought, Evans had not batted well for some years and Swetman had impressed behind the stumps throughout the tour and his batting had improved beyond all hopes. Peter Richardson had failed repeatedly as an opening batsman in the Tests and was replaced by his old opening partner Arthur Milton, even though he had broken his finger at Christmas. Willie Watson was dropped in favour of the newly arrived Cambridge and Sussex batsman Ted Dexter, who was also a more than useful swing bowler. May also had his final trump card, the fast bowler Fred Trueman, who had been ill at Brisbane and left out at Melbourne. He is widely considered to be England's greatest fast bowler and with good reason; he was the first man to take 300 wickets in Tests—307 at (21.57)—had tremendous stamina and bowled with a near perfect side on action that produced late swing at high pace. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>full</b> of confidence and believed that he could get any batsman out on any wicket. Australia made changes as well, dropping Lindsay Kline who had taken 0/77 in two Tests and Bobby Simpson who had made a duck but was retained as twelfth man for his fielding. Instead they brought in the dual purpose fast-medium seamer and off-spinner Keith Slater, who had been twelfth man in the Second Test, but who had been accused of throwing by the MCC and Keith Miller. Mel McInnes kept his place as umpire even though Peter May and Freddie Brown had pointedly asked if it was necessary for him to officiate in all the Tests.|$|E
500|$|Although as High Commissioner Constantine {{looked after}} {{his staff and}} was {{respected}} by other diplomats, Howat observes there is limited evidence that he was successful in the post: [...] "In the one area in which he acted positively, he blundered—the Bristol affair. In {{the language of the}} game he loved... his timing was wrong though <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>full</b> of good intentions". Howat adds that he did not increase his stature or reputation during his term of office. Mason believes that [...] "there was too much of the welfare officer about him and not enough of the government focused diplomat." ...|$|E

500|$|Henry Winter {{writing for}} The Daily Telegraph gave a brief {{explanation}} as to why Arsenal did not perform – their striker Henry was [...] "not at the races." [...] <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>full</b> of praise of United's determination and summarised: [...] "Yet though Arsenal had dominated possession, United had offered the more impressive individuals." [...] Matt Dickinson of The Times described the victory as huge for [...] "Ferguson and his faltering squad," [...] regardless of the scoreline or indeed if Arsenal had played the better football in patches. The Guardian correspondent Kevin McCarra felt aggrieved in the manner Arsenal had ended their unbeaten run, but pointed out they were fortunate no action was taken when Cole fouled Ronaldo. He closed his piece with an illustration of how impressive Arsenal's run was: [...] "In those prior 49 games they had never even been behind in the closing 20 minutes." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1835, Clifford {{was elected}} to the Massachusetts legislature, where he sat on a {{committee}} that revised the state's statutes. [...] In 1836 he served as an aide to Governor Edward Everett, a position he held until Everett lost the 1839 election. [...] Everett rewarded Clifford for his service by naming him district attorney for the southern district of the state in 1839, a post he held for ten years. [...] He was concurrently elected state senator representing Bristol County in 1845. [...] In 1849 he was appointed state attorney general by Governor George N. Briggs. [...] He was the only major appointed Whig official retained by Democrat George S. Boutwell after he took office in 1851. [...] Boutwell explained in his memoirs that Clifford [...] "was a good officer and an upright man, but he lacked the quality which enables a man to reach conclusions. [...] This peculiarity made him useful to me. He would investigate a subject, give me the authorities and precedents, and leave the conclusions to me. Next, {{there was no one in}} the administration party whom I wished to appoint. Mr. [...] Hallett was the candidate most generally supported. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>full</b> of prejudices and he was not well instructed as a lawyer. In these respects Clifford was his opposite." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Talking bollocks" [...] {{generally}} means talking nonsense or bullshit, for example: [...] "Don't {{listen to}} him, he's talking bollocks", or [...] "...talking absolute bollocks".

Bollockspeak tends to be buzzword-laden and largely content-free, like gobbledygook: [...] "Rupert, we'll have to leverage our synergies to facilitate a paradigm shift by Q4" [...] is an example of management bollockspeak. There is a whole parodic book entitled The Little Book of Management Bollocks. When a great deal of bollocks is being spoken, it may be said that the 'bollocks quotient' is high.|$|E

2500|$|Kelly {{also became}} famous for making unusual plays.

Right after his death, his longtime captain-manager in Chicago, Cap Anson, said he was a [...] "genius" [...] as a coacher. [...] Apparently referring to Kelly's ability to distract opposing fielders, Anson said, [...] "Many a run has been scored through Kelly's trickiness. He was a rattling all-around man, but his cleverest work was done behind the plate [...] <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>full</b> of tricks and was never so happy as when playing a practical joke."

2500|$|Grimm's {{scientific}} character combined {{breadth and}} unity. He {{was as far}} removed from the narrowness of the specialist who has no ideas or sympathies beyond just one author or corner of science as he was from the shallow dabbler who feverishly attempts to master the details of a half-dozen unrelated pursuits. The same concentration exists within his own specialised studies. [...] The very foundations of his nature were harmonious; his patriotism and love of historical investigation realised their fullest satisfaction {{in the study of the}} language, traditions, mythology, laws and literature of his own country. But from this centre, he pursued his investigations in every direction as far as his instinct allowed. He was equally fortunate in the harmony that existed between his intellectual and moral natures. He cheerfully made the heavy sacrifices that science demands from its disciples without envy or bitterness; although he lived apart from his fellow men, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>full</b> of human sympathy.|$|E
2500|$|In 1895–1896 Bunin divided {{his time}} between Moscow and Saint Petersburg.

In June 1898 Bunin moved to Odessa. Here he became close to the Southern Russia Painters Comradeship, became friends with Yevgeny Bukovetski and Pyotr Nilus. In the winter of 1899–1900 he began attending the Sreda (Wednesday) literary group in Moscow, striking up a friendship with the Nikolay Teleshov, among others. Here the young writer made himself quite a reputation as an uncompromising advocate of the realistic traditions of classic Russian literature. [...] "Bunin made everybody uncomfortable. Having got this severe and sharp eye for real art, feeling acutely {{the power of a}} word, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>full</b> of hatred towards every kind of artistic excess. In times when (quoting Andrey Bely) [...] "throwing pineapples to the sky" [...] was the order of the day, Bunin's very presence made words stick in people's throats," [...] Boris Zaitsev later remembered.
