5|$|I {{had little}} hopes on Monday last {{but to have}} supped in your cabin: but it pleased God to order it otherwise. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thankful</b> for it. As for those cowardly captains who deserted you, hang them up, for by God they deserve it.|$|E
500|$|Many {{survivors}} of the tragedy refused to blame anyone. Survivor John Jacques wrote, [...] "I blame nobody. I am not anxious to blame anybody... I {{have no doubt that}} those who had to do with its management meant well and tried to do the best they could under the circumstances." [...] Another survivor, Francis Webster, was quoted as having said, [...] "Was I sorry that I chose to come by hand cart? No. Neither then nor any minute of my life since. The price we paid to become acquainted with God was a privilege to pay and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thankful</b> that I was privileged to come in the Martin Hand Cart Company." [...] On the other hand, survivor John Chislett, who later left the Church, wrote bitterly of Richards promising them that [...] "we should get to Zion in safety." ...|$|E
500|$|.....I {{remain an}} utter disbeliever {{in almost all}} that you {{consider}} the most sacred truths. I will pass over as utterly contemptible the oft-repeated accusation that sceptics shut out evidence because {{they will not be}} governed by the morality of Christianity... <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thankful</b> I can see much to admire in all religions. To the mass of mankind religion of some kind is a necessity. But whether there be a God and whatever be His nature; whether we have an immortal soul or not, or whatever may be our state after death, I can have no fear of having to suffer for the study of nature and the search for truth, or believe that those will be better off in a future state who have lived in the belief of doctrines inculcated from childhood, and which are to them rather a matter of blind faith than intelligent conviction.|$|E
6000|$|... 'There is nothing,' said Annie, 'that {{we have in}} common. I {{have long}} found that there <b>is</b> nothing. If <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>thankful</b> to my husband for no more, instead of for so much, <b>I</b> should <b>be</b> <b>thankful</b> to him for having saved me from the first mistaken impulse of my undisciplined heart.' ...|$|R
60|$|This was {{the most}} {{charitable}} view he could take of the matter, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thankful</b> that no worse result followed.|$|R

2500|$|Vaughan's {{memorial}} {{was held}} on August 30, 1990, at Laurel Land Cemetery in Dallas, where he was buried next to his father, and was preceded by a private chapel service for close friends and family. Reverend Barry Bailey of the United Methodist Church in Fort Worth, who was Vaughan's AA sponsor, opened the service with personal thoughts: [...] "We're here to thank God for this man's life. He was a genius, a superstar, a musician's musician. He captured the hearts of {{thousands and thousands of}} people. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thankful</b> for the impact of this man's influence on thousands of people in getting his own life together in the name of God." [...] Kim Wilson, Jeff Healey, David Bowie, Charlie Sexton, ZZ Top, Colin James, and Buddy Guy attended the event. Stevie Wonder, Jackson Browne, and Bonnie Raitt sang [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] at the event. Nile Rodgers gave a eulogy, while a member of the Nightcrawlers read chapters five and eleven from The Big Book, the foundation of Alcoholics Anonymous. In 1995, the Vaughan family received an undisclosed settlement for wrongful death.|$|E
2500|$|Zaid welcomed Abdullah's {{announcement}} {{in spite of}} the lack of a formal apology, saying: [...] "(One) can say sorry in other ways." [...] George Seah's son told the press that although all his father wanted was an apology, the family would not reject any goodwill payments. Tan Sri Wan Suleiman Pawanteh's wife said: [...] "Although I thank the prime minister, I feel less than satisfied at his decision (not to make a straightforward apology). This {{is not the end of}} the story for me. (Without an apology) I don't know, people don't know, that my husband was not guilty. I want my husband's name to be cleared. I feel my husband was innocent. He was an honest judge...Even so, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thankful</b> that our prime minister cares about us enough (to do this much)." [...] Tan Sri Eusoffe Abdoolcader's granddaughter regretted that acknowledgement had been so late in coming: [...] "I wish he was here. He's the main person affected by all this. It's a different case from the others (Salleh and Wan Suleiman) because he was reinstated. It's been 12 years. It should have been solved earlier." [...] Tun Salleh Abas however welcomed Abdullah's statement, saying: [...] "I feel great. It was something I didn't expect. I suffered so much humiliation ... so much so I ran away from the public and took solace in being a farmer." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Conde at Jarnac, Charles XII. at Pultowa--which?' said Louis. 'I {{thought of}} both myself--only, unluckily, I made such frightful blunders. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thankful</b> to my men for {{bringing}} me off, like other great commanders.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Nuttie stood pouting, {{but more}} {{thoughtful}} and less violent, as she said, 'How can <b>I</b> <b>be</b> <b>thankful?</b> <b>I</b> don't want position or anything. I only {{want him to}} let my--my own mother, and aunt, and me alone.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Humph!” The man {{fell back}} a little. “Well, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thankful</b> for that. But you boys {{had no right}} to look at it,” he grumbled.|$|E
60|$|I {{hope you}} {{did not get a}} chill in the garden. The weather is a little wrong again, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thankful</b> for last night's sunset.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] {{answered}} Leo, {{out of the}} gloom. [...] "'Sufficient to the day is {{the evil}} thereof,' <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thankful</b> enough to be here." ...|$|E
60|$|Mabane grunted, {{and took}} up his brush. For once <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thankful</b> that we <b>were</b> alone. At last I saw my way. After weeks of {{ineffective}} scribbling {{a glimpse of the}} real thing had come to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Haven't <b>I</b> <b>been</b> {{in hiding}} {{for the last}} six weeks?" [...] he asked her. [...] "And haven't <b>I</b> <b>been</b> <b>thankful</b> to sleep in a ditch? And wasn't I campaigning before that? I tell you I couldn't sleep in a bed. It's a habit I've lost entirely." ...|$|R
60|$|And while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing this, little G. {{seemed to}} be possessed by {{the spirit of the}} brook to caper down into the ravine, with a series of leaps far safer for a {{waterfall}} than a boy. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thankful</b> when <b>I</b> saw him safely at the bottom.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know. Bessie fools {{one into}} {{thinking}} oneself always doing her a favour. Oh, Rachel, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thankful</b> {{you have never}} taken to being agreeable." ...|$|E
6000|$|PHOEBE. He was so amusing {{from the}} first. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thankful,</b> Susan, that I too {{have a sense}} of humour. I am {{exceedingly}} funny at times; am I not, Susan? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "If {{she will}} have you, {{there is no good}} thing I would not wish for you both," [...] I said; but in spite of my efforts my voice rang hollow, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thankful</b> when Cotton, who did not seem to notice it, rode away.|$|R
60|$|My little pupil {{was away}} for the day--gone {{to play with the}} clergyman's {{children}} down in the village, and my time <b>was</b> my own. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thankful,</b> for <b>I</b> could not possibly have forced myself into the wearisome routine of lesson hearing and teaching. Solitude was my only relief.|$|R
60|$|Indeed, {{it was the}} Captain who awakened me, not I the Captain, {{saying that}} {{daylight}} was on the break and we had better be stirring. So {{we went down to}} the Store, where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thankful</b> to find that everything had been tidied up in accordance with my directions.|$|R

6000|$|... "Not with me. I like {{a little}} of everything; a little absurdity, for example, is very amusing. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thankful</b> for a few queer people; but much {{of them is a}} bore." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "One must live, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thankful</b> to do {{anything}} to lighten Ailie's burthen.

60|$|She sighed, {{and kissed}} me. And I felt at last that I {{had come home}} after many wanderings. We sat down, mother and {{daughter}} on the sofa with their fingers locked.
