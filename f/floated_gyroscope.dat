40|$|Inertial {{navigation}} devices include star sensor, GPS, and gyroscope. Optical {{fiber and}} laser gyroscopes provide high accuracy, and their manufacturing costs are also high. Magnetic suspension rotor gyroscope improves the accuracy {{and reduces the}} production cost of the device because {{of the influence of}} thermodynamic coupling. Therefore, the precision of the gyroscope is reduced and drift rate is increased. In this study, the rotor of liquid <b>floated</b> <b>gyroscope,</b> particularly the dished rotor gyroscope, was placed under a thermal field, which improved the measurement accuracy of the gyroscope. A dynamic theory of the rotor of liquid <b>floated</b> <b>gyroscope</b> was proposed, and the thermal field of the rotor was simulated. The maximum stress was in x, 1. 4; y, 8. 43; min[*] 97. 23; and max[*] 154. 34. This stress occurred at the border of the dished rotor at a high-speed rotation. The secondary flow reached 5549 [*]r/min, and the generated heat increased. Meanwhile, the high-speed rotation of the rotor was volatile, and the dished rotor movement was unstable. Thus, nanomaterials must be added to reduce the thermal coupling fluctuations in the dished rotor and improve the accuracy of the measurement error and drift rate...|$|E
40|$|A {{summary of}} the results of the 12 Marshall Space Flight Center science demonstrations {{performed}} on Skylab is presented. The demonstrations include diffusion in liquids, ice melting, liquid <b>floating</b> zone, <b>gyroscope,</b> liquid films, immiscible liquids, Rochelle salt growth, deposition of silver crystals, fluid mechanics, neutron environment, orbital mechanics, and charged particle mobility...|$|R
50|$|The sensors used in AIRS are <b>floated</b> {{gas bearing}} <b>gyroscopes</b> and SFIR accelerometers which are {{derivatives}} of PIGA accelerometers. Although {{this type of}} accelerometer is most accurate it contains many precise parts which makes them very expensive to build (approximately $300,000 per unit). PIGA/SFIR accelerometers are also very susceptible to failure because of complicated design.|$|R
50|$|A {{critical}} {{requirement for}} accuracy is low static friction (stiction) in the bearings of the pendulum; this {{is achieved by}} various means ranging from double ball bearing with a superimposed oscillatory motion to dither the bearing above its threshold or {{through the use of}} gaseous or fluid bearings or by the alternative method of <b>floating</b> the <b>gyroscope</b> in a fluid and restraining the residual mass by jewel bearings or electromagnetic means. Although this later method still has the viscous friction of the fluid this is linear and has no threshold and has the advantage of having minimal static friction. Another aspect is the accurate control of the gyroscope's rotational rate.|$|R
50|$|A {{recovered}} MMIA accelerometer from an unexploded V2 {{was presented}} to Dr Charles Stark Draper of the United States's MIT instrumentation lab who had been developing the basis of inertial navigation for aircraft by initially concentrating efforts on achieving extremely low drift rate gyroscopes known as a <b>floated</b> integrating <b>gyroscope.</b> Draper combined ideas from his integrating gyroscopes, which were mounted in cans that floated in fluids that were {{held in place by}} jeweled bearings, with the recovered V2 accelerometer by floating the pendulum-gyroscope portion. The more generic name of PIGA was suggested by Dr Draper due to the addition of various refinements such as electromagnetic or optical sensing of pendulum position. Such accelerometers were used in the Titan II and Polaris Systems and Minuteman systems.|$|R
