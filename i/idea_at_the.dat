In 1795, his writing being enthusiastically received, Dennie was persuaded to begin a literary journal, The Tablet. William Spotswood, a Boston printer and bookseller, agreed to oversee the entire enterprise, splitting the profits evenly with Dennie. Such a literary journal was a novel <b>idea</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, and it was well received among the city's elite. Despite the initial excitement surrounding the project and content from noted writers such as John Sylvester John Gardiner, The Tablet lasted {{only a few months}} before folding, having published thirteen issues.|$|E
5|$|Australia having {{declared}} war on 3September 1939, the RAAF Air Board met in November to discuss Mary Bell's letter, but postponed taking any further action. Bell continued to lobby, as did various women's groups seeking to support the war effort and free male staff for overseas postings. In July 1940, the new Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Burnett, invited her to produce {{a proposal for a}} women's auxiliary, supervised by her husband John, who had rejoined the Air Force at the war's outbreak and was now a wing commander in the Directorate of Organisation at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne. Mary recommended forming the new service under the Air Force Act to permit women to enlist {{for the duration of the}} war under conditions similar to RAAF members, rather than enrolling on a short-term contractual basis, a radical <b>idea</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time which would not be put in place until 1943. She also suggested a volunteer reserve or 'citizen' force to augment the enlisted women, effectively the existing WATC, though this was seen as placing too much emphasis on her personal command. Various senior Air Force officers, including the recently promoted Air Marshal Williams, and the Director of Personnel Services, Group Captain Joe Hewitt, opposed a women's service. Burnett, an RAF member who appreciated how the WAAF proved its worth during the Battle of Britain, championed its establishment as the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force (WAAAF).|$|E

5|$|Louis Pasteur {{was unable}} to find a causative agent for rabies and speculated about a {{pathogen}} too small to be detected using a microscope. In 1884, the French microbiologist Charles Chamberland invented a filter (known today as the Chamberland filter or the Pasteur-Chamberland filter) with pores smaller than bacteria. Thus, he could pass a solution containing bacteria through the filter and completely remove them from the solution. In 1892, the Russian biologist Dmitri Ivanovsky used this filter to study what is now known as the tobacco mosaic virus. His experiments showed that crushed leaf extracts from infected tobacco plants remain infectious after filtration. Ivanovsky suggested the infection might be caused by a toxin produced by bacteria, but did not pursue the <b>idea.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> time it was thought that all infectious agents could be retained by filters and grown on a nutrient medium– this was part of the germ theory of disease. In 1898, the Dutch microbiologist Martinus Beijerinck repeated the experiments and became convinced that the filtered solution contained a new form of infectious agent. He observed that the agent multiplied only in cells that were dividing, but as his experiments did not show that it was made of particles, he called it a contagium vivum fluidum (soluble living germ) and re-introduced the word virus. Beijerinck maintained that viruses were liquid in nature, a theory later discredited by Wendell Stanley, who proved they were particulate. In the same year Friedrich Loeffler and Paul Frosch passed the first animal virus– agent of foot-and-mouth disease (aphthovirus)– through a similar filter.|$|E

Allegri 9, I- 42100 Reggio Emilia, ItalyConference AimsThe {{purpose of}} the conference is to {{initiate}} an investigation into how current research on computer games touches upon philosophical issues. In line with this purpose, the conference is interdisciplinary, drawing together researchers from very diverse fields: philosophy, computer game-theory, semiotics, aesthetics, sociology, psychology, and anthropology. The conference is a collaboration between the Department of Philosophy, Classics, History of Art and <b>Ideas</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Oslo; the Center for Computer Game Research <b>at</b> <b>the</b> IT-University of Copenhagen; Department of Social, Cognitive and Quantitative Science <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Modena/Reggio Emilia and the Philosophical Project Centre (FPS), Oslo. The conference is the second international instalment of The Third Place, an ongoing project on philosophical problems arising from the increasing cultural/societal significance of computer games. The first instalment of the project, the conference “The Third Place: Computer Games and Our Conception of the Real”, was a shared initiative of FPS in Oslo and the Center for Computer Game Research <b>at</b> <b>the</b> IT-University of Copenhagen. That conference took place <b>at</b> <b>the</b> IT-University of Copenhagen on May 20 - 21, 2005.

25|$|During Law's time as Colonial Secretary, {{the three}} main issues were the {{question}} of manpower for the British Army, the crisis in Ireland and the Dardanelles Campaign. Dardanelles took priority, as seen by Asquith's restructuring of his War Council into a Dardanelles Committee. Members included Kitchener, Law, Churchill, Lloyd George and Lansdowne, with the make-up divided between political parties to defuse tension and provide criticism of policy. The main discussion was {{on the possibility of}} reinforcing the forces already landed, something Law disagreed with. With Asquith and the Army in support, however, he felt that he was ill-equipped to combat the proposal. Five more divisions were landed, but faced heavy casualties for little gain. As a result, Law led a strong resistance to the <b>idea</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> next Committee meeting on 18 August. The idea only avoided being scrapped thanks to the French promise to send forces in early September, and the arguing became an immense strain on the government.|$|E
25|$|As governor, Gayoso de Lemos {{consolidated}} {{the military}} power of Spain in New Orleans, still fearing a possible thrust south by Britain and desiring to keep Spanish Louisiana a buffer between the U.S. (with its territory now extending to Natchez) and Spanish Texas. He was pragmatic and continued the unofficial policy of allowing Americans {{to bring their}} slaves with them from the north, although the importation of new slaves had been prohibited since 1792. However, he was dogmatic {{in other areas of}} government; in 1798, he issued a comprehensive edict concerning Catholicism as the state faith of the colony. In addition to increasing formal church membership, it attempted to coerce people to give up unnecessarily working on Sundays and holy days. In the edict Gayoso de Lemos condemned anyone who challenged the theology or social centrality of the Church. In 1798 he also instituted state-run garbage collection (a novel <b>idea</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time), {{to prevent the spread of}} diseases and bad smells in the city.|$|E
25|$|New Regent Street is a {{pedestrian}} mall in Christchurch.

Due to its coherent architectural character, the buildings in the streets are listed as Category I heritage items by Heritage New Zealand, and in addition, the entire street has a historic area listing. The street was pedestrianised in 1994 in preparation for the introduction of the , which began operation in February 1995. Damaged in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, the street and buildings reopened in April 2013, and the tram returned from November of that year. Following the 2016 Valentine's Day earthquake, five of the buildings that had not been repaired after the previous earthquakes have been cordoned off, which stopped the tram from operating on its original heritage loop until May.|$|E

25|$|How Xenocrates {{tried to}} {{establish}} and connect scientifically these assumptions, which appear to be taken chiefly from his books {{on the nature of}} the gods, we do not learn, and can only discover the one fundamental <b>idea</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> basis of them, that all grades of existence are penetrated by divine power, and that this grows less and less energetic in proportion as it descends to the perishable and individual. Hence he also appears to have maintained that as far as consciousness extends, so far also extends an intuition of that all-ruling divine power, of which he represented even irrational animals as partaking. But neither the thick nor the thin, to the different combinations of which he appears to have tried to refer the various grades of material existence, were regarded by him as in themselves partaking of soul; doubtless because he referred them immediately to the divine activity, and was far from attempting to reconcile the duality of the principia, or to resolve them into an original unity. Hence too he was for proving the incorporeality of the soul by the fact that it is not nourished as the body is.|$|E

500|$|Although Henson's {{elevation}} was controversial chiefly among {{factions of}} the clergy– in general lay people supported his appointment– it nevertheless gave fresh impetus {{to the idea}} of taking away from the prime minister the power to choose bishops.

He argued from historical examples that appointments made at the Church's instigation were partisan and disastrous, and that the Crown and prime minister were able to take an unbiased view in the national interest. Despite the public support for him, the controversy revived Henson's feelings of isolation.|$|E
