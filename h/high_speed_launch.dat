50|$|The Type Two HSL was a 63 ft <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>launch</b> craft made by British Power Boat Company (BPBC). The craft {{were used}} during the Second World War for air-sea rescue {{operations}} to save Allied aircrew from the sea. The Type Two superseded the 64 ft <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>launch,</b> and itself {{was replaced by the}} 68 ft Type Three HSL also built by the BPBC. It was nicknamed the 'Whaleback' due to the distinctive curve to its deck and humped cabin.|$|E

50|$|In February 1930 the Duke married Loelia Ponsonby in London. After the ceremony, {{the happy}} couple {{made their way}} to Westminster Pier, from where the Duke piloted his bride by <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>launch</b> to the Cutty Sark, moored at Deptford. Unfortunately the bride was {{extremely}} seasick during the Channel crossing.|$|E
5000|$|However, the {{internal}} arrangements of the RAF 100 was to prove vulnerable to combat damage, its high deck made {{the recovery of}} aircrew in the water difficult, and for wartime use it was underarmed. These shortcomings were rectified in the Type Two <b>High</b> <b>Speed</b> <b>Launch,</b> nicknamed the [...] "Whaleback" [...] from its deck shape.|$|E
50|$|RAF Kalafrana {{also served}} as an ASR centre, {{operating}} a number of <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>launches</b> of various types. A secondary base at Ta' Veccia in St. Paul's Bay gave the maritime section greater coverage and reduced reaction times.|$|R
5000|$|The Xpress {{has nearly}} the same track layout as the [...] "Rock 'n' Roller Coaster" [...] models at Disney Parks. The Xpress' layout {{is a bit more}} spacious to {{compensate}} for a <b>higher</b> <b>speed</b> <b>launch</b> due to the trains being lighter without the musical hardware.|$|R
50|$|As {{the vessels}} it had {{inherited}} from the Navy began wear out the RAF began to have built for it <b>launches</b> capable of <b>higher</b> <b>speeds</b> and {{in light of the}} larger crews of some aircraft, greater capacity. This would in the late 1930s lead to the acquiring of <b>High</b> <b>Speed</b> <b>Launches</b> (HSL) for rescue operations.|$|R
50|$|The United States Coast Guard (USCG) Short Range Prosecutor is a 7-meter, <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>launch</b> {{designed}} to be launched from cutters, at speed, from a stern launching ramp.The Short Range Prosecutor is a rigid-hull inflatable, powered by water-jets, for intercepting and boarding suspect vessels. It mounts a radar and special shock-proof seats, and can travel at 30 knots.|$|E

50|$|The Type Two 63 ft HSL was {{designed}} in 1937 by Hubert Scott-Paine; 63 foot long and {{known as the}} Whaleback from the distinctive curve to its deck. This was the main <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>launch</b> class ship used during the Second World War and {{was instrumental in the}} rescue of Allied aircrew from the sea after they were shot down.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1930s speed trials {{took place on}} the Thames for Armed <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>launches</b> some of which would latter form the fleet of boats used in Air Sea Rescue piloted by watermen during the 1940s. 400 barges or Thames {{lighters}} were turned over to military use as bumboats or simply beached during the Normandy landings of 1944.|$|R
5000|$|Constructed in 1962, the AEDC Range-G is {{the largest}} {{routinely}} operated light-gas gun in the United States. It is located at Arnold Engineering Development Center on Arnold Air Force Base. The design of the range came from collaboration between German and American scientists after World War II.

50|$|Coastal Forces was a {{division}} of the Royal Navy established during World War II. It consisted of small coastal defence craft which the Navy designated with names such as: Motor Launch, <b>High</b> <b>Speed</b> <b>Launch,</b> air-sea rescue, Motor Gun Boat and Motor Torpedo Boat. It did not include landing craft, trawlers or purpose-built minesweepers. Other Navies operated equivalent boats, but classified and named them somewhat differently.|$|E
50|$|British torpedo boats of the First World War {{were small}} at only around 15 tons and {{were known as}} Coastal Motor Boats. In the Second World War, British MTBs were {{operated}} by Coastal Forces. A similar size boat with a different role in the Second World War was the BPB 63 ft <b>High</b> <b>Speed</b> <b>Launch</b> used by the RAF. The last MTBs in the Royal Navy were the two s of 1958 which were capable of 50 kn.|$|E
50|$|The Long Range Interceptor is an 11-meter (approximately 36 feet) <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>launch</b> vessel {{designed}} to be deployed from United States Coast Guard cutters via a rear launching ramp.The Long Range Interceptor is a rigid hull inflatable, powered by water-jets, for intercepting and boarding suspect vessels. It mounts a radar, special shock-proof seats, and can travel at 35 knots. They can be armed with machine guns or grenade launchers, and have ballistic panels for crew protection.|$|E
50|$|During World War II the British Power Boat Company built {{large numbers}} of Motor Torpedo Boats, <b>High</b> <b>Speed</b> Motor <b>Launches,</b> and Motor Gun Boats (previously known as Motor Anti-Submarine Boats), being {{credited}} with saving the lives of over 13,000 service personnel.|$|R
25|$|As more <b>High</b> <b>Speed</b> <b>Launches</b> became {{available}} these were formed into new dedicated Air Sea Rescue Units (ASRU). Together with {{the expansion of}} the ASRS component of the MCS, the ASRS worked to improve the survival of aircrews through the development and issue of better individual survival equipment-including one man inflatable dinghies for fighter pilots copied from the Germans; the training of aircrew in ditching drills to maximise their chances of surviving to be retrieved; the development and fielding of air droppable survival equipment; and better coordination and collaboration amongst the different services, branches and units in the locating and retrieval of downed airmen.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the biggest}} oversights of the entire system {{was the lack of}} {{adequate}} air-sea rescue organisation. The RAF had started organising a system in 1940 with <b>High</b> <b>Speed</b> <b>Launches</b> (HSLs) based on flying boat bases and at a number of overseas locations, but it was still believed that the amount of cross-Channel traffic meant that {{there was no need for}} a rescue service to cover these areas. Downed pilots and aircrew, it was hoped, would be picked up by any boats or ships which happened to be passing by. Otherwise the local life boat would be alerted, assuming someone had seen the pilot going into the water.|$|R
5000|$|In 2012, Grizzly Gulch (Traditional Chinese: 灰熊山谷) opened as the park's {{equivalent}} to Frontierland. Grizzly Gulch {{is much smaller}} compared to the [...] "Frontierlands" [...] of other Disney Parks, featuring only one ride, Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars. This roller coaster attraction is {{a variation of the}} [...] "Big Thunder Mountain Railroad" [...] attractions found at other Disney Parks, featuring special ride elements unique to this attraction, including backwards portions, and a <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>launch</b> section.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "whaleback" [...] {{has also}} been applied to a type of <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>launch</b> first {{designed}} for the Royal Air Force during World War II, and to certain smaller rescue and research vessels especially in Europe that, like the Great Lakes vessels, have hulls that curve over to meet the deck. An example of the former is the British Power Boat Company Type Two 63 ft HSL. The designation in this case comes not from the curve along the gunwale, but from the fore and aft arch in the deck.|$|E
50|$|During September 1944, British {{aircraft}} dropped leaflets {{printed in}} German over the islands almost every night, then on 22 September an unarmed air-sea rescue <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>launch</b> HSL-2632 travelled from France {{to a point}} near St Martin’s point off Guernsey, arriving late and not finding any German ship to meet them, they proceeded to St Peter Port harbour under a white flag, met by E-boat S-112 which {{was not aware of}} the proposed meeting. A message was sent ashore but the opportunity for a discussion was refused. The HSL-2632 sailed off to England, being fired at by an 8.8 cm battery on Alderney who were not aware of the attempted peace mission.|$|E

50|$|Ynys Gaint lies {{close to}} the Anglesey shore at OS {{reference}} SH561725, between Ynys Faelog and Ynys Castell. Between 1942 and 1944 the island housed a Royal Air Force air-sea rescue unit, with several <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>launches,</b> and {{a small part of}} the island is still occupied by the MOD, housing a Royal Naval Auxiliary Service (RNXS) unit until 1994. A quasi-military presence remains on the island in the form of an Army Cadet unit and the Maritime Volunteer Service. There are also two privately owned residential properties on Ynys Gaint. One of these had a portion of its garden designed by Sir Clough Williams-Ellis, of Portmeirion fame.|$|R
5000|$|In one {{of these}} {{nighttime}} missions, 19 June 1940, the squadron attacked the Ruhr. Pickard's Wellington was hit by anti-aircraft fire and one engine was seriously damaged. Losing altitude, {{he was able to}} nurse the aircraft past the coast but ended up having to ditch in the North Sea. The crew escaped alive and all entered a rubber dinghy. After a number of hours they were located by an RAF <b>High</b> <b>Speed</b> <b>Launch</b> from Felixstowe. Unfortunately, Pickard had set down in a mined area. [...] It took several more hours for them to drift out from among the mines so they could be picked up. In all they spent 14 hours in the bitter cold of the North Sea.|$|E
50|$|To {{launch the}} trains, Storm Runner {{utilizes}} a system invented by Intamin that launches the trains using hydraulics. This system {{is similar to}} the propulsion on a locomotive wheel except it doesn't spin completely. The inner diameter of the wheel is attached to the hydraulic actuator and the outer radius of the wheel is then attached to the launch mechanism. The outer diameter of the wheel amplifies the energy output from the slow actuator stroke creating a <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>launch</b> in a matter of seconds. A pusher car is attached to the launch mechanism and the train attaches to this pusher car prior to launch. Once the train reaches the end of the launch area, the pusher car disengages and gravity does the rest.|$|E
50|$|On the 2 October 1944 six Beaufighters of Coastal Command {{took off}} from Langham {{to carry out a}} night patrol along the Frisian Islands of the coast of the Netherlands. Their task was to {{randomly}} attack any enemy shipping encountered there. One of the aircraft (NT 909) was piloted by New Zealander Warrant Officer Douglas Mann. His navigator was English and he was Flight Sergeant Donald Kennedy. Close to the island of Borkum the plane went into an attack on a convoy, but in poor visibility the plane struck an unknown obstacle causing Mann to lose control. The Convoy’s flak ships opened fire on the stricken plane shooting it down and, after some difficulty, Mann and Kennedy took to their rescue dinghy. After several abortive rescue attempts the airmen were finally rescued by <b>High</b> <b>Speed</b> <b>Launch</b> 2679, stationed at Gorleston-on-Sea, on the 10 October after being in the sea for eight days. When the Skipper of the Launch, Flying Officer David Ross located them and pulled them aboard the men were both suffering from acute hypothermia and immersion foot. They were taken to Great Yarmouth naval Hospital were both men made a full recovery. Douglas Mann was eventually returned to 489 Squadron and awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.|$|E
50|$|HSC Max Mols is a <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> {{catamaran}} <b>launched</b> on 1 December 1997 at the Incat shipyard in Tasmania. She {{has spent}} the majority of her career serving the Aarhus-Odden route with Mols Linien. She has frequently been chartered to other operators in the Baltic Sea and English Channel.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} Robertson-built Fairmile boats had {{distinguished}} war records: ML-160 was lead vessel in the starboard column during Operation Chariot, the St Nazaire Raid on the heavily defended German dry dock and naval base in March 1942; {{many of the}} boats took part in Operation Overlord, the invasion of Normandy; and several of these <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>launches</b> were engaged in top secret operations in the Mediterranean. MTB 625 and MTB 653 were built for the Royal Norwegian Navy and famously {{took part in the}} secretive 30th MTB Flotilla operations out of Lerwick. MTB 718, which was launched at the yard in 1944, took part in clandestine operations in France and Norway {{towards the end of the}} war.|$|R
50|$|Air-sea rescue {{by flying}} boat or {{floatplane}} was a method used by various nations before World War II {{to pick up}} aviators or sailors who were struggling in the water. Training and weather accidents could require an aircrew to be pulled from the water, and {{these two types of}} seaplane were occasionally used for that purpose. The limitation was that if the water's surface were too rough, the aircraft {{would not be able to}} land.Though closer to shore (e.g. in the English Channel) the RAF Air Sea Rescue Service operated <b>High</b> <b>Speed</b> <b>Launches</b> but until 1943, the most that could be done was to drop emergency supplies to the survivors, including an inflatable rubber dinghy carried as-standard in RAF aircraft.|$|R
