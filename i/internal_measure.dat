30|$|The {{remainder}} {{of this article is}} organized as follows: Sect. 2 examines some popular criteria of deciding whether found clusters are valid, and the general procedure we used in this article to evaluate stream clustering. In Sect. 3, we list eleven different mostly used <b>internal</b> evaluation <b>measures</b> and shortly show how they are actually exploited in clustering evaluation. In Sect. 4, we introduce a set of thorough experiments on different kinds of data streams with different errors to show the behaviors of these <b>internal</b> <b>measures</b> in practice with a k-means-based stream clustering algorithm. In addition, we investigate more concretely how the <b>internal</b> <b>measures</b> react to stream-specific properties of data. To do this, several common error scenarios in stream clusterings are simulated and also evaluated with internal clustering validation. In Sect. 5, the <b>internal</b> evaluation <b>measures</b> are again used to validate a density-based stream clustering. This is done by first extracting a “ground truth” of the clustering quality using external evaluation measures and then checking which of the <b>internal</b> <b>measures</b> has the highest correlation with that ground truth. Finally, in Sect. 6, we summarize the contents of this article.|$|R

50|$|When a {{clustering}} {{result is}} evaluated {{based on the}} data that was clustered itself, this is called internal evaluation. Those that use a gold standard are called external measures and {{are discussed in the}} next section - although when they are symmetric they may also be used as measures between two clusters for internal evaluation. These methods usually assign the best score to the algorithm that produces clusters with high similarity within a cluster and low similarity between clusters. One drawback of using internal criteria in cluster evaluation is that high scores on an <b>internal</b> <b>measure</b> do not necessarily result in effective information retrieval applications. Additionally, this evaluation is biased towards algorithms that use the same cluster model. For example, k-means clustering naturally optimizes object distances, and a distance-based internal criterion will likely overrate the resulting clustering.|$|E

However, such supervised measures are not directly useful for construction of better clustering algorithms when class labels are not provided. We propose a method for identifying <b>internal</b> cluster evaluation <b>measures</b> that use only information present in the dataset and are related to given external indices. We utilize these <b>internal</b> <b>measures</b> {{for the construction of}} representative based clustering algorithms. Both identification and utilization steps of the proposed method are enabled by use of a component-based clustering algorithm design. Experiments on 432 algorithms using gene expression data sets provide evidence that some <b>internal</b> <b>measures</b> could be used as surrogates for external indices proposed in the literature. Moreover, the obtained results suggest that <b>internal</b> <b>measures</b> correlated to selected external indices can guide the algorithms toward significantly better cluster models.

There are mainly two kinds of statisticbased measures for word extraction: the <b>internal</b> <b>measure</b> and the contextual measure. This paper discusses these two kinds of measures for Chinese word extraction. First, nine widely adopted internal measures are tested and compared on individual basis. Then various schemes of combining these measures are tried so as to improve the performance. Finally, the left/right entropy is integrated to see the effect of contextual measures. Genetic algorithm is explored to automatically adjust the weights of combination and thresholds. Experiments focusing on two-character Chinese word extraction show a promising result: the F-measure of mutual information, the most powerful <b>internal</b> <b>measure,</b> is 57. 82 %, whereas the best combination scheme of internal measures achieves the F-measure of 59. 87 %.

We develop a nonstandard measure theory with values in a complete non-Archimedean valued field K, e. g. the p-adic numbers Q_p. The corresponding theory for real-valued measures is well known {{by the work of}} P. A. Loeb, R. M. Anderson and others. We first review some of the standard facts on non-Archimedean measures and briefly sketch the prerequisites from nonstandard analysis. Then internal measures on rings and algebras with values in a nonstandard field ^*K are introduced. We explain how an <b>internal</b> <b>measure</b> induces a K-valued Loeb measure. The standard-part map between a Loeb space and the underlying standard measure space is measurable almost everywhere. We establish liftings from measurable functions to internal simple functions. Furthermore, we prove that standard measure spaces can be described as push-downs of hyperfinite <b>internal</b> <b>measure</b> spaces. This result is an analogue of a well-known Theorem on hyperfinite representations of Radon spaces. Then standard integrable functions are related to internal S-integrable functions and integrals are represented by hyperfinite sums. Finally, the results are applied to measures and integrals on Z_p and Z_p^×. We obtain explicit series expansions for the p-adic zeta function and the p-adic Euler-Mascheroni constant which we use for computations. Comment: 29 pages, 2 figure...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{extend the}} {{standard}} formalism {{of quantum mechanics}} to a quantum theory for a total system including one <b>internal</b> <b>measuring</b> apparatus. The internality of the measuring apparatus implies that different decomposition of a given density operator for the <b>internal</b> <b>measuring</b> apparatus into mixture of pure states may have different physical implications. We use `specified mixed-state description' to call a density operator with a specified decomposition into mixture of pure states. The proposed theory has three basic assumptions, which roughly speaking have the following contents: (i) Physical states of the total system {{can be associated with}} vectors in the total Hilbert space; (ii) the dynamical evolution of a state vector obeys Schrödinger equation; and (iii) under a principle of compatible description and certain non-transition condition, a pure-vector description of the total system may imply the existence of certain specified mixed-state description. The principle of compatible description states that different mathematical descriptions for the same physical state of the total system must give consistent predictions for results of measurements performed by the <b>internal</b> <b>measuring</b> apparatus. This principle imposes a restriction to vectors in the Hilbert space and this may effectively break the time-reversal symmetry of Schrödinger equation. Comment: 23 pages, 2 figure.

For a specific measure i, minimizing the fraction mentioned in Eq. 14 implies that the numerator is considerably smaller than the denominator. Thus, the deviation of the measure i from the ground truth V_truth^i is considerably smaller than the deviation from its own mean. Thus, we can get some kind of guaranty that this correlation is strong enough. As we are unable to find an <b>internal</b> <b>measure</b> i whose V_best^i=V_truth^i, we perform this approximation to find the one with the closest tendency to make V_truth^i its V_best^i.|$|E

40|$|Background Setting {{thresholds}} {{is important}} for the practical use of <b>internal</b> software <b>measures,</b> so software modules can be classified as having either acceptable or unacceptable quality, and software practitioners can take appropriate quality improvement actions. Quite a few methods have been proposed for setting thresholds and several of them are based on the distribution of an <b>internal</b> <b>measure’s</b> values (and, possibly, other <b>internal</b> <b>measures),</b> without any explicit relationship with any external software quality of interest. Objective In this paper, we empirically investigate the consequences of defining thresholds on <b>internal</b> <b>measures</b> without taking into account the external measures that quantify qualities of practical interest. We focus on fault-proneness as the specific quality of practical interest. Method We analyzed datasets from the PROMISE repository. First, we computed the thresholds of code measures according to three distribution-based methods. Then, we derived statistically significant models of fault-proneness that use <b>internal</b> <b>measures</b> as independent variables. We then evaluated the indications provided by the distribution-based thresholds when used along with the fault-proneness models. Results Some methods for defining distribution-based thresholds requires that code measures be normally distributed. However, we found that this is hardly ever the case with the PROMISE datasets, making that entire class of methods inapplicable. We adapted these methods for non-normal distributions and obtained thresholds that appear reasonable, but are characterized by a large variation in the fault-proneness risk level they entail. Given a dataset, the thresholds for different internal measures—when used as independent variables of statistically significant models— provide fairly different values of fault-proneness. This is quite dangerous for practitioners, since they get thresholds that are presented as equally important, but practically can correspond to very different levels of user-perceivable quality. For other distribution-based methods, we found that the proposed thresholds are practically useless, as many modules with values of <b>internal</b> <b>measures</b> deemed acceptable according to the thresholds actually have high fault-proneness. Also, the accuracy of all of these methods appears to be lower than the accuracy obtained by simply estimating modules at random. Conclusions Our results indicate that distribution-based thresholds appear to be unreliable in providing sensible indi cations about the quality of software modules. Practitioners should instead use different kinds of threshold-setting methods, such as the ones that take into account data about the presence of faults in software modules, in addition to the values of <b>internal</b> software <b>measures...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{implement}} statistical process control (SPC) in service quality using three-level SERVQUAL, quality function deployment (QFD) and <b>internal</b> <b>measure.</b> Design/methodology/approach – The SERVQUAL questionnaire is developed according to internal services of train. Also, it is verified by reliability scale and factor analysis. QFD method is employed for translating SERVQUAL dimensions’ importance weights which are derived from Analytic Hierarchy Process into internal measures. Furthermore, the limits of the Zone of Tolerance are used to determine service quality specification limits based on normal distribution characteristics. Control charts and process capability indices are used to control service processes. Findings – SPC is used for service quality through a structured framework. Also, an adapted SERVQUAL questionnaire is created for measuring quality of train’s internal services. In the case study, it is shown that reliability is the most important dimension in internal services of train for the passengers. Also, the service process is not capable to perform in acceptable level. Research limitations/implications – The proposed algorithm is practically applied to control the quality of a train’s services. <b>Internal</b> <b>measure</b> is improved for continuous data collection and process monitoring. Also, it provides an opportunity to apply SPC on intangible attributes of the services. In the other word, SPC is used to control the qualitative specifications of the service processes which have been measured by SERVQUAL. Originality/value – Since SPC is usually used for manufacturing processes, this paper develops a model to use SPC in services in presence of qualitative criteria. To reach this goal, this model combines SERVQUAL, QFD, normal probability distribution, control charts, and process capability. In addition, it is a novel research on internal services of train with regard to service quality evaluation and process control. Hadi Akbarzade Khorshidi, Sanaz Nikfalazar, Indra Gunawa...|$|E
