5|$|The {{makeshift}} raft is shown as barely seaworthy as it rides the deep waves, {{while the men}} are rendered as broken and in utter despair. One old man holds the corpse of his son at his knees; another tears his hair out in frustration and defeat. A number of bodies litter the foreground, waiting to be swept away by the surrounding waves. The men in the middle have just viewed a rescue ship; one points it out to another, and an African crew member, Jean Charles, stands on an empty barrel and frantically waves <b>his</b> <b>handkerchief</b> to draw the ship's attention.|$|E
25|$|In the end, {{the pair}} condemn Croker to jump. When A {{goes to the}} window to inspect Croker, however, he is {{surprised}} by something inexplicable that causes him to remove <b>his</b> <b>handkerchief</b> and bring it timidly to the would-be jumper’s face. Although critics Ackerley and Gontarski assert that A’s discovery is an “enigmatic smile” on Croker’s face, Beckett makes no mention of this in the ending, leaving it open to various interpretations such as Croker may be crying (justifying the handkerchief), smiling, was dead prior to A and B’s arrival or else died during the process.|$|E
25|$|The {{police and}} the gang fired {{at each other for}} about a quarter of an hour. Then there was a lull but nothing could be seen {{for a minute or two}} because of the smoke. Superintendent Hare {{returned}} to the railway-station with a shattered left wrist from one of the first shots fired. He bled profusely, but Tom Carrington, artist for the Australasian Sketcher, stopped the haemorrhage with <b>his</b> <b>handkerchief.</b> Hare then ordered O'Connor to surround the hotel, and later attempted to return to the battle but gradually lost so much blood that he had to be conveyed to Benalla by a special railway engine.|$|E

500|$|Cambridge were pre-race favourites {{although}} former Oxford rower {{and author}} George Drinkwater {{noted that the}} public had been unaware of the significant improvements from Oxford following their transition to the Clasper vessel. Oxford won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex {{side of the river}} to Cambridge. [...] The race started at 5:39 p.m. and quickly descended into chaos: darkness was falling and it became quickly apparent that the Cambridge crew had not heard the command to [...] "go" [...] from the starter Searle. [...] By now, according to Oxford's bow G. C. Bourne, [...] he was [...] "old with a feeble voice", and although the Oxford stroke L. R. West saw Searle drop <b>his</b> <b>handkerchief,</b> and set off, the Cambridge boat did not move.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Atkinson reprised his {{character}} for a live performance {{as part of}} the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. In the scene, Mr. Bean works within the London Symphony Orchestra in its performance of [...] "Chariots of Fire", conducted by Simon Rattle. For this scene, Bean does not wear his usual brown tweed sports jacket, but the traditional clothing of the musician - white tie and tails. As they perform the piece, Bean is mostly bored with playing the same note repeatedly on the synthesiser and gets jealous of the more interesting part being played on the grand piano. Still bored, he takes out his mobile phone and takes a picture of himself, looking proud. He then sneezes in a comical fashion and tries to retrieve <b>his</b> <b>handkerchief</b> from his bag behind him, finding he cannot reach it while at the synthesizer, until he uses an umbrella to maintain his performance. When he finally blows his nose with his handerchief, he throws it into the grand piano.|$|E
500|$|Seydlitz's {{first months}} as a cornet were made {{difficult}} by the regimental colonel, who considered him a spy for the Margrave, and abused him by sending him on useless errands and generally {{making it clear}} that the cornet was no match for the colonel. Within a year of Seydlitz's commission, the old King Frederick William died and his son, Frederick II of Prussia, ascended to the throne. [...] Frederick claimed Silesia from the Habsburg's Maria Theresa, and made a broad appeal to arms. [...] The Margrave's regiment {{played an important role in}} the ensuing war, during which Seydlitz came to the notice of the King several times. Once, when Frederick asked the caliber of the artillery shelling the Prussian line, opinions were divided and vague. Seydlitz rode in front of the battery, halting in their line of fire. When he saw a ball hit the ground, he picked it up, wrapped it in <b>his</b> <b>handkerchief</b> and presented it to the King.|$|E
6000|$|... 'So it is. Wonder if Spitfire {{was right}} about these beastly spots?' And Dolly sat down to try dry {{cleansing}} with one of <b>his</b> <b>handkerchiefs.</b> 'Asleep?' he asked, {{after a few moments}} of this cheerful occupation, fearing that his chum might be too comfortable when he was in a fume himself.|$|R

500|$|The Privy Garden was {{originally}} {{created as a}} private royal pleasure garden and continued to serve a similar purpose during the Interregnum (1649–1660), when the English Council of State put considerable effort and money into repairing and improving the garden. They appear to have reserved it exclusively for their own use, with their own individual keys for access. By Samuel Pepys' time, after the Restoration of the monarchy, it had become [...] "a through-passage, and common." [...] The wall that enclosed the garden was often used by ballad-sellers to display their wares to passers-by, and courtiers used it to air their laundry. Pepys recorded his titillation {{at the sight of}} the underwear of Charles II's mistress, Lady Castlemaine, hanging out to dry in the Privy Garden. A century later, James Boswell wrote in his diary that he had taken a prostitute into the garden and [...] "indulged sensuality", but he was shocked to find when he got home that she had stolen <b>his</b> <b>handkerchief.</b>|$|E
500|$|One {{of those}} convicted, James Reid {{committed}} suicide by hanging {{himself in his}} prison cell, using <b>his</b> <b>handkerchief</b> attached to a nail in the wall. The remaining six were hanged and then burned on the Gallow Green in Paisley on 10June 1697, the last mass execution for witchcraft in western Europe. John and James Lindsay, brothers from Formakin Mill, near Houston, aged 11 and 14 respectively, held each other's hands as they were hanged together. Catherine Campbell, after having been carried struggling and screaming to the gallows, [...] "called down the wrath of God and the Devil on her accusers" [...] before being despatched. Margaret Fulton appeared to have become insane, and [...] "spoke cheerfully about visits to Elfland and the Abode of the Fairies {{on the backs of}} magical horses". Margaret Lang admitted to consorting with the Devil, but said that she had renounced sin and was reconciled with God. Agnes Naismith laid a [...] "dying woman's curse" [...] on everyone present and their descendants; for many years afterwards every tragedy in the town was blamed on [...] "the witches' curse".|$|E
2500|$|In 1916, in {{the earlier}} phase of Berlin's career, {{producer}} and composer George M. Cohan, during a toast to the young Berlin at a Friar's Club dinner in his honor, said, [...] "The thing I like about Irvie is that although he has moved up-town and made lots of money, it hasn't turned his head. He hasn't forgotten his friends, he doesn't wear funny clothes, {{and you will find}} his watch and <b>his</b> <b>handkerchief</b> in his pockets, where they belong." ...|$|E

2500|$|The crowd {{stood and}} applauded {{for almost two}} minutes. Gehrig was visibly shaken as he {{stepped away from the}} microphone, and wiped the tears away from his face with <b>his</b> <b>handkerchief.</b> Babe Ruth came over and hugged him as a band played [...] "I Love You Truly" [...] and the crowd chanted, [...] "We love you, Lou". The New York Times account the {{following}} day called it [...] "one of the most touching scenes ever witnessed on a ball field", that made even hard-boiled reporters [...] "swallow hard." ...|$|E
2500|$|Arne was so keen {{on music}} that he smuggled a spinet {{into his room}} and, damping the sounds with <b>his</b> <b>handkerchief,</b> would {{secretly}} practise during the night {{while the rest of}} the family slept. He also dressed up as a liveryman in order to gain access to the gallery of the Italian Opera. It was at the opera that Arne first met the musician and composer Michael Festing, who was a major influence on him. Festing not only taught him to play the violin, but also took him to various musical events, including going to compete against [...] Thomas Roseingrave for the post of organist at Hanover Square, and a visit to Oxford in 1733 to hear George Frideric Handel's oratorio Athalia.|$|E
2500|$|During {{this portion}} of the fighting, Captain Elliott had {{requested}} that Dolphin provide fire support to the Marines by shelling the Spanish blockhouse and nearby positions with her naval guns. Through a miscommunication of signals, however, the gunboat began unknowingly dropping shells in the direct path of a small force of fifty marines and ten Cuban irregulars led by 2nd Lt. Magill, who was attempting to flank the Spanish position and potentially cut off any avenue of retreat. [...] Affixing <b>his</b> <b>handkerchief</b> to a long stick and braving the Spanish fire, Sergeant John H. Quick took up an exposed position on the ridge to immediately wigwag a flag signal to Dolphin to adjust her gunfire. War Correspondent Stephen Crane, who had accompanied the Marines, later described the scene in his war tale [...] "Marines Signaling Under Fire at Guantanamo": ...|$|E

2500|$|Monçada and John are {{interrupted}} {{by the appearance of}} Melmoth himself. He confesses to them his purpose on Earth, that his extended life is almost over, and that he has never been successful in tempting another into damnation: [...] "I have traversed the world in the search, and no one to gain that world, would lose his own soul!" [...] Melmoth has a dream of his own damnation, and of the salvation of Stanton, Walberg, Elinor, Isidora and Monçada. He asks John and Monçada to leave him alone for his last few hours of mortal existence. They hear terrible sounds from the room, but when they enter, the room is empty. They follow Melmoth's tracks {{to the top of a}} cliff, and see <b>his</b> <b>handkerchief</b> on a crag below them. [...] "Exchanging looks of silent and unutterable horror", they return home.|$|E
2500|$|Called a “St. Francis of the wilderness,” [...] Sheffey was {{renowned for}} his {{concern about the}} welfare of animals. [...] He once {{dismounted}} to collect tadpoles in <b>his</b> <b>handkerchief</b> {{so that he could}} transfer them to a stream from a small pool where they were certain to die. [...] Others he tried to save by bringing water to their mud hole. [...] Sheffey regularly stopped to right beetles and dropped out of funeral processions to lift insects {{out of the way of}} wagon wheels. [...] He gave his lunch to hungry dogs and tried (unsuccessfully) to “relieve” flies caught on sticky paper. [...] Once when his brother-in-law cut a wasp in two with a pair of scissors, Sheffey went out to the yard and starting praying. [...] When the brother-in-law asked why, he replied, “I am praying for the Lord to make another wasp to take the place of the one you killed.” [...] Sheffey was especially solicitous of his horse. [...] He specifically instructed hosts how to water and feed his horse, and he often dismounted rather than make the horse carry him up a steep grade. Sheffey had a sweet tooth and would often fill his mouth with sugar, honey, or maple syrup. [...] He regularly prayed, “Lord, bless the little honeybees for they make sweet honey. Like sweet Jesus.” ...|$|E
