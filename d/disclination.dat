50|$|A <b>disclination</b> {{is a line}} {{defect in}} which {{rotational}} symmetry is violated. In analogy with dislocations in crystals, the term, disinclination, for liquid crystals first used by F. C. Frank and since then has been modified to its current usage, disclination.It is a defect in the orientation of director whereas a dislocation is a defect in positional order.|$|E

40|$|Restricted Access. The {{influence}} of elastic anisotropy on twist <b>disclinations</b> in nematic liquid crystals has been considered. It is shown that anisotropy alters the structure {{as well as}} the energy of <b>disclinations.</b> The problem is exactly solvable when there is twist anisotropy only. i. e., K 11 = K 33 ne K 22. When there is pure splay-bend anisotropy one can get the leading corrections to the structure and energy through a perturbation technique. The properties of twist and wedge <b>disclinations</b> in the presence of anisotropy have also been compared. Elastic anisotropy influences +sand -s <b>disclinations</b> differently in the case of wedge <b>disclinations,</b> but not so in the case of twist <b>disclinations.</b> For pure splay-bend anisotropy, twist <b>disclinations</b> have, in general, a higher energy than wedge <b>disclinations.</b> This may partly account for the absence of twist <b>disclinations</b> in nematic liquid crystals...|$|R

5000|$|The {{existence}} of the hexatic phase was proposed by John Michael Kosterlitz and David J. Thouless as well as Bertrand Halperin, David Robert Nelson and A. P. Young in theoretical studies about melting in two dimensions. They proposed two phase transitions by binding of topological defects (dislocation and declination). The first transition occurs when the solid (quasi-long-range positional order, long-range orientational order) undergoes a dislocation unbinding transition to the hexaticphase (short-range positional order, quasi-long-range orientational order). The second transition is the <b>disclination</b> unbinding transition which transforms the hexatic phase into an isotropic phase (short-range positional and orientational order).|$|E
50|$|There {{exists a}} close analogy of {{geometry}} of spacetime with {{the structure of}} defects in crystal. Dislocations are represented by torsion, disclinations by curvature. These defects are not independent of each other. A dislocation is equivalent to a disclination-antidisclination pair, a <b>disclination</b> is equivalent to a string of dislocations. This is the basic reason why Einstein's theory based purely on curvature can be rewritten as a teleparallel theory based only on torsion. There exists, moreover, infinitely many ways of rewriting Einstein's theory, {{depending on how much}} of the curvature one wants to reexpress in terms of torsion, the teleparallel theory being merely one specific version of these.|$|E

We found modified stress functions for the twist <b>disclination.</b> In addition, we calculate the <b>disclination</b> density, effective Frank vector, <b>disclination</b> torsion and effective Burgers vector of a straight twist <b>disclination.</b> By means of gauge theory of defects we decompose the elastic distortion into the translational and rotational gauge {{fields of the}} straight twist <b>disclination.</b> Comment: 21 pages, 4 figure...|$|E
40|$|The {{spontaneous}} {{emergence of}} collective flows is a generic property of active fluids and {{often leads to}} chaotic flow patterns characterised by swirls, jets, and topological <b>disclinations</b> in their orientation field. However, the ability to achieve structured flows and ordered <b>disclinations</b> is of particular importance {{in the design and}} control of active systems. By confining an active nematic fluid within a channel, we find a regular motion of <b>disclinations,</b> in conjunction with a well defined and dynamic vortex lattice. As pairs of moving <b>disclinations</b> travel through the channel, they continually exchange partners producing a dynamic ordered state, reminiscent of Ceilidh dancing. We anticipate that this biomimetic ability to self-assemble organised topological <b>disclinations</b> and dynamically structured flow fields in engineered geometries will pave the road towards establishing new active topological microfluidic devices.

We determine the structure of the walls and explain the main features of the dynamics.

3000|$|We {{postulate}} that <b>disclinations</b> {{could be}} natural defects at the intersections of material interfaces (i.e. junction of interfaces). This {{is the case}} triple lines, twin tips or ledges on the twin interface. This has also been suggested in other body of works (Bollmann 1970; Xu et al. 2013; Barrett and El Kadiri 2014). With regards to disclinations’ habit planes, as suggested by atomistic simulations -albeit providing at best circumstantial evidence- we further postulate that <b>disclinations</b> can naturally glide on minimum energy interface planes. In the case of tensile twinning in magnesium, <b>disclinations</b> would therefore glide on the [...] (101 ̅ 2) twin plane. In addition, wedge <b>disclinations</b> which would bound {{the tip of a}} twin domain could also glide/climb on the basal/prismatic interface. The latter was shown to be a minimum energy interface. In what concerns the ’dark side’ of the twin (Liu et al. 2016), i.e. observing the twin domain along the twin shear direction, twist <b>disclinations</b> would then potentially ’cross-slip’ on pyramidal/pyramidal boundaries (i.e. { 2 ̅ 110 }//{ 21 ̅ 1 ̅ 0 } or potentially { 1 ̅ 010 }//{ 101 ̅ 1 ̅}).|$|R

40|$|Introduction Although the {{electronic}} properties of elastic materials containing topological defects {{have been widely}} studied since the early 50 's [1, 2] {{in the context of}} deformation potential theory, there has been a recent revival of interest in such problems using both gauge field theory [3 to 5] and Riemann-Cartan geometry [6 to 8]. In this work we use the latter approach to study the effects of the curvature associated with <b>disclinations</b> in a monolayer of graphite. <b>Disclinations</b> have a fundamental role in the formation of non-flat low-dimensional carbon structures such as fullerenes and graphene tubules among others. They are responsible for the local curvature that bends those structures into their various shapes. This is easily seen by incorporating <b>disclinations</b> to a graphite sheet. Graphite has a honeycomblike, flat, two-dimensional carbon network made solely of 6 -membered rings. Rings made of a number of carbon atoms other than 6 correspond to <b>disclinations.</b> They ar...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{interactions}} between a nematic liquid crystal <b>disclination</b> and {{the surface of the}} half-space which bounds it. When strong anchoring conditions are applied on the bound-ary, we show how the biaxial core of the <b>disclination</b> affects the repulsive force that tends to drive the <b>disclination</b> away from the surface. If we replace the strong boundary conditions with an anchoring potential, the surface-disclination interaction depends on the surface ex-trapolation length. In particular, we show that the nematic may expel the <b>disclination</b> if the anchoring strength is below a critical value. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} the {{interaction}} between a surface <b>disclination</b> and a bulk <b>disclination</b> placed symmetrically with respect to it has been considered {{on the basis of the}} continuum theory. It is found that at large distances the bulk <b>disclination</b> is attracted by the surface <b>disclination</b> with a force that is independent of the sign of the former. The force of attraction is found to be nearly the same for bulk disclinations of strength 1 / 2, 1 and 2. The theory appears to qualitatively account for the experimental observations of Kléman and Williams...|$|E
40|$|The {{relation}} between two elastic continuum approaches to grain boundary structure, the dislocation and <b>disclination</b> models, is discussed. It is {{shown that the}} <b>disclination</b> model has two advantages: a well-behaved expression for the elastic energy of <b>disclination</b> dipole walls, which describes the elastic energy over a wide interval of misorientations, and a continuous misorientation angle dependence of the elastic energy of grain boundaries in an interval between two delimiting boundaries. The elastic energy of the most general, faceted <b>disclination</b> wall is calculated. For cases in which both the energies of delimiting boundaries and elastic constants are available from atomic simulations (001 and 111 tilt boundaries in copper and 001 and 011 tilt boundaries in diamond) quantitative agreement between the <b>disclination</b> model and simulation results is obtained...|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} that in nematic liquid {{crystals}} the <b>disclinations</b> which {{are attached to}} the external boundaries of the specimens can be described by a Peierls-Nabarro type model known from the theory of crystal dislocations. Mathematically, dislocations with planar cores and surface <b>disclinations</b> are then completely analogous if the isotropic one-constant approximation and a planar distribution of the director are assumed. Solutions are first given for <b>disclinations</b> in a half-cylinder of large radius and the possibility of an asymmetry in the distribution of the director on the surfaces, which may be caused by an asymmetry in the anchoring forces, is discussed. <b>Disclinations</b> confined to one of the surfaces of a thin nematic layer are also studied. It is shown that the boundary conditions on the other surface may introduce an asymmetry into the distribution of the director in the bulk of the specimen. This long-range asymmetry should be distinguished from the intrinsic, short range asymmetry...|$|R
