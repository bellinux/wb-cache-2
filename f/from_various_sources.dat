5|$|King Arthur is {{a legendary}} British leader who, {{according}} to medieval histories and romances, led the defence of Britain against Saxon invaders {{in the late}} 5th and early 6th centuries AD.

The sparse historical background of Arthur is gleaned <b>from</b> <b>various</b> <b>sources,</b> including the Annales Cambriae, the Historia Brittonum, and the writings of Gildas.

5|$|There are {{numerous}} {{portions of the}} long-running British science-fiction television programme Doctor Who that are no longer held by the BBC. Between 1967 and 1978 the BBC routinely deleted archive programmes, for various practical reasons (lack of space, scarcity of materials, a lack of rebroadcast rights). As {{a result of the}} cull, 97 of 253 episodes from the programme's first six years are currently missing, primarily from seasons 3 through 5, leaving 26 serials incomplete.

5|$|Before Animaniacs was {{put into}} {{production}} in 1991, various collaboration and brainstorming efforts were thought up to create both the characters and premise of the series. For instance, ideas that were thrown out were Rita and Runt being the hosts of the show and the Warners being duck characters that senior producer Tom Ruegger drew in his college years. After the characters from the series were created, they were all shown to executive producer Steven Spielberg, who would decide which characters would make it into Animaniacs (the characters Buttons and Mindy were chosen by Spielberg's daughter). The characters' designs came <b>from</b> <b>various</b> <b>sources,</b> including caricatures of other writers, designs based on early cartoon characters, and characters that simply had a more modern design.|$|E

5|$|Jesus is {{the central}} figure of Christianity. Although Christian views of Jesus vary, it is {{possible}} to summarize the key beliefs shared among major denominations, as stated in their catechetical or confessional texts. Christian views of Jesus are derived <b>from</b> <b>various</b> <b>sources,</b> including the canonical gospels and New Testament letters such as the Pauline epistles and the Johannine writings. These documents outline the key beliefs held by Christians about Jesus, including his divinity, humanity, and earthly life, and that he is the Christ and the Son of God. Despite their many shared beliefs, not all Christian denominations agree on all doctrines, and both major and minor differences on teachings and beliefs have persisted throughout Christianity for centuries.|$|E
5|$|Non-musical subjects, both {{religious}} and numerological, influenced Sorabji's music, too, {{and he took}} inspiration <b>from</b> <b>various</b> <b>sources.</b> His Fifth Piano Sonata (Opus archimagicum) is inspired by the tarot, and his Tāntrik Symphony for Piano Alone has seven movements titled after the bodily centres of Tantric and Shaktic yoga. The song Benedizione di San Francesco d'Assisi sets the text of a Catholic benediction. However, Sorabji did not intend the first two of these works to be programmatic, and he heaped scorn on attempts to represent stories or ideologies in music.

5|$|The {{chronology}} {{of the tomb}} monument's completion is not precisely known, but portions can be determined <b>from</b> <b>various</b> <b>sources.</b> According to the passing reference of a Florentine notary, in 1424 (by the Florentine calendar) part of the tomb was installed. Michelozzo's Catasto from July 1427 indicates that Michelozzo had been Donatello's partner {{for about two years}} ("due anni o incircha") and that three-fourths of the 800florin budget had been spent. To harmonize these accounts, one must conclude either that Michelozzo's chronology was imprecise, that Donatello received the commission before the partnership was formed, or that the 1424 date in the Florentine calendar falls in 1425 in the modern calendar.|$|E
5|$|The museum's founder Sigurður Hjartarson {{worked as}} a teacher and {{principal}} for 37 years, teaching history and Spanish at Reykjavík's Hamrahlid College for the last 26 years before his retirement. As a child, he owned a bull's pizzle, which was given to him to use as a cattle whip. He began collecting penises after a friend heard the story of the bull's penis in 1974 and gave him four new ones, three of which Sigurður gave to friends. Acquaintances at whaling stations began bringing him whale penises as well, and the collection grew from there, expanding through donations and acquisitions <b>from</b> <b>various</b> <b>sources</b> around Iceland.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1945 {{he became}} Professor of Physics at the University of Melbourne vice Laby, a {{position}} he held until 1959. He built up a nuclear physics research school {{at a time when}} Australian universities were only just beginning to award PhDs, and most research students went abroad to pursue their studies. He attempted to equip it as best as his limited funds would allow. Wherever possible, equipment and parts were built by staff and students. His cosmic ray group participated in the 1947–48 Antarctic expedition of , and he designed and built a 200 kV neutron generator and a 1 MeV Van de Graaff generator. A 3 MeV betatron was converted an 18 MeV electron synchrotron in 1948. A 5 to 12 MeV cyclotron was the largest machine built at the University up to that time. Design work began in 1953, and it commenced operation in 1957, running until 1976. Martin did not have the money to build it, but managed to scrounge funding and components <b>from</b> <b>various</b> <b>sources.</b> Although he was an experimental physicist, he created a theoretical physics group under Courtney Mohr. He also managed to persuade the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) to transfer CSIRAC, Australia's first digital electronic computer, to the School of Physics in 1955, creating the first academic computing facility in Australia, and the beginning of computer science at the University of Melbourne.|$|E
