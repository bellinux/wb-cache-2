40|$|Abstract. The 2004 electoral {{campaign}} {{marks the beginning}} of internet use in the political communication in Romania. It has also been the first campaign that resorts to negative communication via online tools. The main actors of this negative campaign, motivated and involved in it by the strategic planners and PR specialists, were the sympathizers of the DA Alliance 2. Its communication consultants launched an online platform on their candidate’s website on which the party members and sympathizers could upload <b>electoral</b> <b>materials.</b> The funnier and more depreciative the <b>electoral</b> <b>materials</b> regarding the Social Democratic Party (SDP) counter-candidate were, the more visible they were online, being sent through email, through visited blogs or viewed on video-sharing websites. As a space dedicated to the freedom of expression, situated beyond any official (state) censorship, the online environment became the space where the DA Alliance sympathizers got actively involved in its campaign. One of the fundamental reasons was that the prime minister in 2004 (a SDP member) was easy to be mocked at and treated on internet {{as if he were a}} peer of the DA Alliance voters. This pseudo-democratization transformed the DA Alliance candidate and its communication strategic planners into winners...|$|R
5000|$|Hood is {{perceived}} to be antagonistic to the Australian Greens, in such policies as providing the right to remove dangerous, sick and dying trees, which the Greens strongly opposed. Hood endorsed weekly garbage collection, in a move the Greens disagreed with because it leads to increases in the amount of household rubbish going to landfill Hood has also been a strong opponent of euthanasia legislation introduced by Steph Key on the basis it fails to provide sufficient corroborative evidence of the desire for suicide apart from the killer as the sole witness, and that the elderly and dying could be pressured into suicide if they felt they became a burden on their family, essentially, that voluntary euthanasia, fortuitously, causes involuntary euthanasia. He also raised the issue that the Greens, who oppose capital punishment, endorse euthanasia. Hood has criticized the high abortion rate, in light of low fertility rates, and has encouraged adoption in lieu. Hood has rejected the scrapping of parliamentary prayer, saying the practice dates back to the establishment of the Westminster system, and that the brief periods were useful for silent reflection. Hood has also rejected legislation to permit the cloning of human embryos, on the basis new technology could create embryonic stem cells without using human embryos and eggs, thereby making the legislation unnecessary. Hood has opposed the decriminalisation of prostitution. which he states is consistent with his Christian feminist position. Hood has also suggested plain-packaged DVD's for content that is restricted by law. Despite being lampooned by the Chaser's War on Everything, in {{that it is necessary to}} have sexual intercourse to have families, Hood denies he has spoken with the Australian Sex Party for a preference deal. Hood has rejected the Greens call to name and shame religious schools which discriminate based on sexual orientation on their web site. Although sometimes failing to block Green legislation, Hood has provided opposition rigor necessary to challenge status quo, including public consultation. The Greens however, sometimes work cooperatively with Family First, for instance in Bob Brown's call for national changes to electoral legislation, following the issue of counterfeit how-to-vote cards by the Australian Labor Party that were passed off as Family First <b>electoral</b> <b>material,</b> in what was also called [...] "unethical, if not illegal" [...] by opposition leader Isobel Redmond. The antagonism was not evident in Hood and the Greens's advocacy of the Adelaide Oval redevelopment. In fact, Parnell has voted in the same way as Hood on several occasions, against both the government and opposition. Nevertheless, Hood has stated that he will never make a preference deal with the Greens, as their core policies are irreconcilable with the positions of Family First.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{draws on}} a study of poster and {{audiovisual}} spot advertisements in the 2014 elections (see Holtz-Bacha et al. in press).

After the National Assembly began meeting for its new term, Sabaye was again designated as First Vice-President of the National Assembly's Legal and Administrative Affairs Commission on 18 September 2007. Dendé Solange appealed the result of the vote in Bétou to the Constitutional Court, accusing Sabaye of transferring voters and campaigning after the official end of the campaign period. Sabaye's lawyer denied the allegations and in turn accused Dendé Solange's supporters of setting fire to <b>electoral</b> <b>materials</b> at three polling stations, preventing those stations from reporting their results.
