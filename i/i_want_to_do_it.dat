500|$|Cresswell {{admitted}} {{he had not}} made the impact {{he had hoped to}} in the York first team, but ahead of 1998–99 said [...] "I've had some stick from a small number of fans, but hopefully I can prove them wrong. I will prove them wrong. This a big season for me. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for York City. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for myself." [...] After a positive start to the season, Cresswell attracted attention from other clubs, with a number of scouts attending matches to watch him play. Manager Alan Little claimed some clubs were making illegal approaches for the player, and that this was having a detrimental effect on his performances. Preston North End manager David Moyes claimed his club had a bid of more than £500,000 for Cresswell rejected, while York chairman Douglas Craig rejected this, saying a formal offer had not been received from any club. He was York's top scorer in 1998–99 with 19 goals from 42 appearances.|$|E
500|$|D'Angelo was {{dissatisfied}} with the direction of R and soul music when conceiving the album. In an interview for Jet, he said that [...] "the term R doesn't mean {{what it used to}} mean. R is pop, that's the new word for R" [...] He also found contemporary R to be [...] "a joke", adding that [...] "the funny thing about it is that the people making this shit are dead serious about the stuff they're making. It's sad—they've turned black music into a club thing." [...] In the liner notes for Voodoo, Saul Williams examined the album's concept and echoes D'Angelo's dissatisfaction with the mainstream direction of contemporary R/soul and hip hop, noting a lack of artistic integrity in the two music genres. In an interview for Ebony, D'Angelo said of his role and influences for Voodoo, [...] "I consider myself very respectful of the masters who came before. In some ways, I feel a responsibility to continue and take the cue from what they were doing musically and vibe on it. That's what I want to do. But <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for this time and this generation". In the album's EPK, D'Angelo said that Voodoo is [...] "like a funk album. The natural progression of soul, the next step to soul is funk".|$|E
500|$|Ross {{described}} Eve's {{relationship with}} Julian Crane as an authentic representation of an interracial couple. She felt Eve was written as a fully realized person {{with her own}} story, {{rather than as a}} [...] "walking, living philosophical statement" [...] about race relations. Ross praised [...] "the people who laid the groundwork for [...] " [...] and allowed characters to be played other than [...] "in a minstrel-like way", similar to Ellen DeGeneres paving the way for Will & Grace. Ross and Amelia Marshall, who played Eve's adoptive sister Liz Sanbourne, believed that the relationship emphasized a difference in social classes rather than races. Initially, Ross felt intimidated by playing a part of a supercouple, saying [...] "t means so much to me that <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> justice", but following the show's cancelation, she identified it as her favorite storyline. She went on to equate the Julian and Eve's love story to that of Romeo and Juliet. [...] "My Baby's Gone", a song that Eve frequently performs on the show during flashbacks, was used to symbolize Eve's relationship with Julian. Ross recorded the vocals for it, as well as four other songs, without the aid of Auto-Tune. Passions was Ross' first singing role. When asked by a fan about her experiences singing on the show, Ross said she worked with a vocal coach, and described her sound as [...] "sincere, soft, [...] non-grating".|$|E

500|$|When Anders and Tyrol {{detonate}} {{the bomb}} {{at the beginning}} of the episode, one of the Number Three (D'anna) models was to film a propaganda film in front of Laura Roslin's (Mary McDonnell) school at the time, but that was cut. Also, Jammer (Dominic Zamprogna) was originally considered the suicide bomber at the end, but was changed to Duck because he had less to live for after his wife's death. In the original drafts, the resistance was not planning suicide bombings, but [...] "freaking the Cylons out" [...] by imprisoning many of them in a secret underground prison, torture them for information, and leave them alive instead of killing them, as they would resurrect otherwise. This would make the Cylons worry about their missing comrades. However, Moore later realized that suicide bombings would be [...] "really potent and really powerful." [...] When writing the scenes involving Duck leading to the suicide bombing, Moore got [...] "emotionally caught up in it," [...] adding [...] "as I was writing these scenes of him standing in the police ranks, we know he's got the belt on. What's he gonna do? And then, oh my God, he actually does it. I mean, it's really horrifying stuff. But it's true. That's why <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> It really happens. People do this." [...] The producers were initially worried that the Sci Fi Channel would not allow the inclusion of the bombing scene, but to Moore's surprise, Sci Fi executive Mark Stern did not object to it.|$|E
