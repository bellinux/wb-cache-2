So it was a quick answer that I should have obviously thought about. But, obviously, negotiations weren't going on. Nothing was going on.|$|E
25|$|In a June 2016 interview, Kiedis {{stated that}} he at first regretted writing Scar Tissue saying “I did regret the book for a while as there was some pain caused then, I started seeing the long term {{positive}} reverberating. People were reading it in hospitals, in prisons and schools and it was having a positive effect. I realised that {{the whole point of}} writing that book wasn’t for me, but to show that somebody can go all the way down and come all the way back and have a productive, successful happy interesting life. And so whatever shame, pain or difficulty or discomfort I went through, then it was worth <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> get so many people coming up to me saying their kids had read it and got their act together because of it.” Kiedis has stated that due to the subject matter in his book, especially his reflections on his sexual relationships, that he hopes that his family hasn't read his book. “I have asked everyone in my family not to read the book.” Kiedis said.|$|E

500|$|Casablanca {{was part}} of the film {{colorization}} controversy of the 1980s, when a colorized version aired on the television network WTBS.

When Ted Turner of Turner Broadcasting System purchased MGM/UA's film library two years later, he canceled the request, before contracting American Film Technologies (AFT) in 1988. AFT completed the colorization in two months at a cost of $450,000. Turner later reacted to the criticism of the colorization, saying, [...] " [...] {{is one of a handful}} of films that really doesn't have to be colorized.

The director explained, [...] "I resented it before I saw <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> thought, 'well, {{how are you going}} to do what Ricky and Steve did. In fact, the first season I didn't get into it at all. In the second season, they really found their voice.

It wasn’t like {{we had a lot}} of people watch it and they didn’t come back to it. If anything, I think we were building slowly, but to me the way TV works is you spend a lot of money advertising and promoting, or you have to let a show stay some place for a long period of time and an audience slowly comes to it.

Fresco also added, [...] "I still feel there’s an audience out there for <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> know that the people who liked it, liked it a lot." ...|$|E

[...] Beyoncé was also motivated by her audience's strong expectations from her as a singer. While preparing her third solo album, Beyoncé wanted to experiment with stronger lyrics and record ballads like [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] because, [...] "the music and the emotion in the story is told [...] so much better.
