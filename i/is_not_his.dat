5|$|The {{scene with}} Peter in the hypnotherapist's office was censored from television, as Peter {{discusses}} his genitals and reproductive organs. When Peter {{comes to the}} realization that Francis <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>his</b> real father and when Stewie dreams about being tortured by Lois, a harp sound can be heard; MacFarlane comments that even small things like that take {{a lot of work to}} produce. The alcohol bottles being pushed by the airplane that Peter and Brian are traveling on were animated by computer, as is the taxi driving along the street. On the DVD commentary, MacFarlane notes that the scene would not have looked good without computer aid. He said it makes the animations seem more realistic than without a computer. The two men circling each other for fifty years and waiting for the other to throw the first punch was not broadcast for television.|$|E

Jack finds Tracy disobeying his order, but Tracy shouts that Jack <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>his</b> dad. Jack and Tracy meet with an NBC shrink, and Jack role-plays Tracy's father, Tracy, and Tracy's mom, among several other people from Tracy's childhood, conveying the message that even though Tracy's parents may have divorced, they still loved him. This comforts Tracy, and affirms that while he loves his family, they are crazy, {{and he needs to}} stay away from them. Tracy hugs Jack, and tells him that he is the only family he needs.|$|E
5|$|Although {{subject to}} all {{national}} laws and government, the Antakarana are also {{united in their}} recognition of the authority of a king (Ampanjaka) who is the living descendent {{of a line of}} Antankarana royalty going back nearly four centuries. The authority of this king is reaffirmed every five years at the village of Ambatoharaña in a ritual mast-raising ceremony called the tsangantsainy. Although some accounts date the ritual back to the origins of Antankarana kingship, the specific features of the ceremony as practiced today are rooted in historical events of the 19th century. The ceremony includes a pilgrimage to Nosy Mitsio to commemorate the flight of Antankarana refugees to the island in the 1830s to escape the advancing armies of the Kingdom of Imerina and to visit the tombs of ancestors who died there; until recently, it has sometimes also included raising both French and Antankarana banners to honor the 1841 treaty signed with the French. The king is selected by a council of elder {{members of the royal family}} in the ruling line. He is responsible for reciting joro (ancestral invocations) at ceremonies where the ancestors' blessings are requested. Another important social role is that of the Ndriambavibe. The Antankarana community selects a single noble woman to hold this position, which has similar authority and importance to that of the king. She <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>his</b> wife; rather, she has a separate leadership role to fulfill. The Antankarana are recognized among Malagasy as one of the few remaining ethnic groups in Madagascar that continues to reassert the ancestral authority of their king through continued practice of traditional kingship rituals.|$|E

Several weeks later, Alice receives flowers and assumes they are from Anthony. Anthony is then forced to take her out again, as {{he does not want to}} upset her.

Later, during a game of spin the bottle, Anthony and Alice kiss, and he then decides that he really does like her and invites her on a proper date. Alice decides she is ready to lose her virginity to Anthony, although he does not pressure her. Her brother Joey (David Witts) overhears and manipulates Anthony into playing poker with Derek. Anthony cannot resist due to his gambling addiction and ends up losing the emporium. Both Derek and Joey tell him to leave and Alice is left stood up. Joey tells her Derek drove Anthony away, so she rushes to the emporium to find Anthony, but is too late as he leaves Walford via the tube station.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{begins with}} Peggy's {{day and a}} heated {{argument}} with her boyfriend Abe, over her preoccupation with work and the effect this has on their sex life. The argument ends with Abe's leaving in a huff. After Don pulls Megan away for an impromptu trip to a Howard Johnson's hotel in upstate New York, Peggy has to pitch to the Heinz executives without them and unsuccessfully tries to sell the Heinz executives on her concept.

Don hangs up on her, and Peggy returns to her office. When Peggy asks about Ginsberg's life, Ginsberg initially claims to be a Martian, stating that Morris Ginsberg <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>his</b> father. Michael was born in a Nazi concentration camp and, after its liberation, Morris claimed him from a Swedish orphanage when Michael was 5 years old.

Sivaramakrishnan is his given name and his father's given name was Laxmanan and hence he started out as L. Sivaramakrishnan as is common with Tamils to keep the first letter of one's father's first name as initial.|$|E
