This condition can progress to scarring of the liver (fibrosis), and advanced scarring (cirrhosis). In some cases, those with cirrhosis go on to develop liver failure or liver cancer.|$|E

40|$|Background: Impaired {{signaling}} in the IFN-g/IL- 12 pathway causes {{susceptibility to}} severe disseminated infections with mycobacteria and dimorphic yeasts. Dominant gain-of-function mutations in signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT 1) {{have been associated}} with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis. 							Objective: We sought to identify the molecular defect in patients with disseminated dimorphic yeast infections. 							Methods: PBMCs, EBV-transformed B cells, and transfected U 3 A cell lines were studied for IFN-g/IL- 12 pathway function. STAT 1 was sequenced in probands and available relatives. Interferon-induced STAT 1 phosphorylation, transcriptional responses, protein-protein interactions, target gene activation, and function were investigated. 							Results: We identified 5 patients with disseminated Coccidioides immitis or Histoplasma capsulatum with heterozygous missense mutations in the STAT 1 coiled-coil or DNA-binding domains. These are dominant gain-of-function mutations causing enhanced STAT 1 phosphorylation, delayed dephosphorylation, enhanced DNA binding and transactivation, and enhanced interaction with protein inhibitor of activated STAT 1. The mutations caused enhanced IFN-g–induced gene expression, but we found impaired responses to IFN-g restimulation. 							Conclusion: Gain-of-function mutations in STAT 1 predispose to invasive, severe, disseminated dimorphic yeast infections, likely through aberrant regulation of IFN-g–mediated inflammationFil: Sampaio, Elizabeth P [...] National Institutes of Health.

5|$|Diseases {{which can}} be {{transmitted}} from one organism to another are known as infectious diseases, and the causative biological agent involved {{is known as a}} pathogen. The process by which the pathogen is introduced into the body is known as inoculation, and the organism it affects is known as a biological host. When the pathogen establishes itself in a step known as colonization, it can result in an infection, consequently harming the host directly or through the harmful substances called toxins it can produce. This results in the various symptoms and signs characteristic of an <b>infectious</b> <b>disease</b> like pneumonia or diphtheria.|$|E
5|$|Hepatitis C is an <b>infectious</b> <b>disease</b> {{caused by}} the {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) that primarily affects the liver. During the initial infection people often have mild or no symptoms. Occasionally a fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, and yellow tinged skin occurs. The virus persists in the liver in about 75% to 85% of those initially infected. Early on chronic infection typically has no symptoms. Over many years however, it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis. In some cases, those with cirrhosis will develop complications such as liver failure, liver cancer, or dilated {{blood vessels in the}} esophagus and stomach.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the significant lack of genetic diversity in cheetahs is a cause of poor quality and production of sperm, and birth defects such as cramped teeth, kinked tails, and bent limbs. Cheetahs do have low fertility rates, but they appear to have flourished for thousands of years with these low levels of genetic variance. Cheetah expert Laurie Marker points out that the high level of genetic uniformity would mean that if an <b>infectious</b> <b>disease</b> surfaced in a population, all of them have (or lack) the same level of immunity. In 1982, 60% of the cheetah population in the Wildlife Safari (Oregon, United States) died due to a peritonitis epidemic.|$|E
5|$|Long-term active {{memory is}} {{acquired}} following infection by activation of B and T cells. Active immunity {{can also be}} generated artificially, through vaccination. The principle behind vaccination (also called immunization) is to introduce an antigen from a pathogen in order to stimulate {{the immune system and}} develop specific immunity against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism. This deliberate induction of an immune response is successful because it exploits the natural specificity of the immune system, as well as its inducibility. With <b>infectious</b> <b>disease</b> remaining one of the leading causes of death in the human population, vaccination represents the most effective manipulation of the immune system mankind has developed.|$|E
5|$|Malaria is a mosquito-borne <b>infectious</b> <b>disease</b> {{affecting}} {{humans and}} other animals caused by parasitic protozoans (a group of single-celled microorganisms) belonging to the Plasmodium type. Malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever, tiredness, vomiting, and headaches. In severe cases it can cause yellow skin, seizures, coma, or death. Symptoms usually begin ten to fifteen days after being bitten. If not properly treated, people may have recurrences of the disease months later. In those who have recently survived an infection, reinfection usually causes milder symptoms. This partial resistance disappears over months to years if the person has no continuing exposure to malaria.|$|E
