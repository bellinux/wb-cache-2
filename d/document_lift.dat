40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new methodology for developing CAT tools that assist translators of technical and scientific texts by (i) on-the-fly highlight of nominal and verbal terminology in a source language (SL) <b>document</b> that <b>lifts</b> possible syntactic ambiguity and thus essentially raises the document readability and (ii) simultaneous translation of all SL document one- and multi-component lexical units. The methodology {{is based on}} a language-independent hybrid extraction technique used for document analysis, and language-dependent shallow linguistic knowledge. It is targeted at intelligent output and computationally attractive properties. The approach is illustrated by its implementation into a CAT tool for the Russian-English language pair. Such tools can also be integrated into full MT systems. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{difficulties}} with Garrard's election over Benjamin Logan in 1795 {{added to a}} litany of complaints about the state's first constitution. Some {{believed that it was}} undemocratic because it required electors to choose the governor and state senators and many offices were appointive rather than elective. Others opposed life terms for judges and other state officials. Still others wanted slavery excluded from the <b>document,</b> or to <b>lift</b> the ban on ministers serving in the General Assembly. In the aftermath of the disputed 1795 election, all parties involved agreed that changes were needed. The present constitution provided no means for amendment, however. The only remedy was another constitutional convention.|$|R
40|$|We can infer on {{the basis}} of factual data from the nationÕs records, of for example, number of {{siblings}}, oneÕs place among siblings in a family, migration, religious affiliation, etc., the possible influences on a typical individual. We can talk about generic migrants, farmers and psychiatric patients. This is usually the most which can be known about a person who lived 100 years ago. The extent to which a person can be known is determined by the quality of the data and our ability to infer mean-ings. Catherine Currie is exceptional because she lives on through her diary. We can know her through the style in which she wrote the diary, through the content, both from her and others. Furthermore, she is known in a way few people can be known. She suf-fered two psychotic illnesses which allow her to be known in sickness as well as health. Those episodes, their development and the aftermaths are docu-mented in the diary and in Yarra Bend Asylum records. These historical <b>documents</b> <b>lift</b> Catherine Currie from being an ordinary figure in society in rural Australia to being in the foreground. Catherine and her diary The seven volumes of the Currie diaries were brought to public notice when Butler collected data for the history of the Buln Buln Shire in Gippsland in south-east Victoria in 1979. Copies of the diaries are held at the State Library of Victoria [1], and the Yarra Bend Asylum records of 1881 [2] and 1895 [3] at the Public Records Office. Data from the diaries have been used in a number of historical publications and most recently in a book by McLeary and Dingle about Catherine Currie and her diary [4]. McLeary and Dingle have undertaken a great deal of research so that the outlines of CatherineÕs parents and their lives are known from birth, marriage and death certificates. Shipping records reveal their arrival in Australia from England with their children. Sarah Ann Catherine Wells was born in England in 1845 and arrived in Victoria in 1853.

40|$|Aim. To {{critically}} {{discuss the}} use of tibolone (T), in light {{of a series of}} very recent double-blind placebo (PL) controlled trials (LISA, LIFT, OPAL, THEBES, LIBERATE) conducted worldwide in a large number of postmenopausal women (PMW). Methods. The most relevant publications on T therapy in PMW were considered with emphasis on menopausal symptoms, quality of life, sexuality, bone, cardiovascular system (CVS) and oncologic risk. Results. T significantly relieves climacteric symptoms and improves mood and sexual well-being (LISA). T is as effective as estrogen–progestin therapy in preventing bone loss and reducing the relative risk of vertebral and non-vertebral fractures (LIFT). By using surrogate endpoints of the individual risks for the CVS, studies show mixed results, but a favourable effect on acute miocardial infarction and thromboembolism has been <b>documented</b> (THEBES, <b>LIFT,</b> OPAL). Although findings about endometrial and colon cancer are reassuring, conclusive data on breast cancer risk with T are not available and an increased risk of recurrence in women with previous breast cancer emerged (LIBERATE). Conclusions. T is effective in treating menopausal syndrome with a good tolerability profile. In spite of some unsolved issues in term of safety, T is still a good treatment option for early PMW...|$|R
40|$|Wind {{turbines}} in {{the field}} can be subjected to many and varying wind conditions, including high winds with rotor locked or with yaw excursions. In some cases the rotor blades may be subjected to unusually large angles of attack that possibly result in unexpected loads and deflections. To better understand loadings at unusual angles of attack, a wind tunnel test was performed. An 18 -inch constant chord model of the NACA 4415 airfoil section was tested under two dimensional steady state conditions in the Ohio State University Aeronautical and Astronautical Research Laboratory (OSU/AARL) 7 x 10 Subsonic Wind Tunnel (7 x 10). The objective of these tests was to <b>document</b> section <b>lift</b> and moment characteristics under various model and air flow conditions. These included a normal angle of attack range of {minus} 20 {degree} to + 40 {degree}, an extended angle of attack range of {minus} 60 {degree} to + 230 {degree}, applications of leading edge grit roughness (LEGR), and use of vortex generators (VGs), all at chord Reynolds numbers as high as possible for the particular model configuration. To realistically satisfy these conditions the 7 x 10 offered a tunnel-height-to-model-chord ratio of 6. 7, suggesting low interference effects even at the relatively high lift and drag conditions expected during the test. Significantly, it also provided chord Reynolds numbers up to 2. 0 million. 167 figs., 13 tabs...|$|R

The objective was to <b>document</b> section <b>lift</b> and moment characteristics model and air flow conditions. Surface pressure data was acquired at {minus} 60 {degrees} through + 230 {degrees} geometric angles of attack, at a nominal 1 million Reynolds number. Cases with and without leading edge grit roughness were investigated. The leading edge mulated blade conditions in the field. Additionally, surface pressure data were acquired for Reynolds numbers of 1. 5 and 2. 0 million, with and without leading edge grit roughness; the angle of attack was limited to a {minus} 20 {degrees} to 40 {degrees} range. In general, results showed lift curve slope sensitivities to Reynolds number and roughness. The maximum lift coefficient was reduced as much as 29 % by leading edge roughness. Moment coefficient showed little sensitivity to roughness beyond 50 {degrees} angle of attack, but the expected decambering effect of a thicker boundary layer with roughness did show at lower angles. Tests were also conducted with vortex generators located at the 30 % chord location on the upper surface only, at 1 and 1. 5 million Reynolds numbers, with and without leading edge grit roughness. In general, with leading edge grit roughness applied, the vortex generators restored 85 percent of the baseline level of maximum lift coefficient but with a more sudden stall break and at a higher angle of attack than the baseline...|$|R
40|$|Hydraulic lift was {{investigated}} among native {{plants in the}} Mojave Desert using in situ thermocouple psychrometers. Night lighting and day shading experiments were used to verify the phenomenon. Hydraulic lift was detected for all species examined: five shrub species with different rooting depths and leaf phenologies and one perennial grass species. This study {{was the first to}} <b>document</b> hydraulic <b>lift</b> for a CAM species, Yucca schidigera. The pattern of diel flux in soil water potential for the CAM species was temporally opposite to that of C 3 species: for the CAM plant, soil water potential increased in shallow soils during the day when the plant was not transpiring and decreased at night when transpiration began. Because CAM plants transport water to shallow soils during the day when surrounding C 3 and C 4 plants transpire, CAM species that hydraulically lift water may influence water relations of surrounding species {{to a greater extent than}} hydraulically lifting C 3 or C 4 species. A strong, negative relationship between the percent sand in the study site soils at the 0. 35 m soil depth and the frequency that hydraulic lift was observed at that depth suggests that the occurrence of hydraulic lift is negatively influenced by coarse-textured soils, perhaps due to less root–soil contact in sandy soils relative to finer-textured soils. Differences in soil texture among study sites may explain, in part, differences in the frequency that hydraulic lift was detected among these species. Further investigations are needed to elucidate species versus soil texture effects on hydraulic lift...|$|R
40|$|The current thesis {{presents}} a numerical study of steady and unsteady turbulent reacting flows. The flow is calculated using Finite Volume based parabolic and elliptic flow solvers. A transported probability density function (pdf) approach, closed at the joint–scalar level, {{is used for}} the inclusion of the thermochemistry. A common characteristic of all the studied cases are the strong finite rate chemistry effects which govern the flow. Two experimentally well <b>documented</b> turbulent <b>lifted</b> flames were computed in order to explore the detailed thermochemical flow structure and to reduce uncertainties associated with the chemical kinetics. The effect of the applied detailed chemistry and its subsequent simplification on the calculated thermochemical structure was also quantified. The two cases feature fuel jets of methane or hydrogen issuing into a vitiated, high temperature coflow. Molecular mixing is closed using the modified Curl’s mixing model and two algebraic closures are considered for the closure of the mixing frequency. More complex flow patterns are considered through the calculation of bluff body stabilised flames. These flames feature a recirculation region and a neck zone of high strain rates, where significant levels of local extinction are found. The transported pdf method captures the local extinction and can predict the pollutant formation with high accuracy. The standard mixing frequency closure leads to over– prediction of local extinction, while an algebraic extension leads to improved predictions. When the flame is close to global extinction, strong instabilities occur, which lead to questions regarding the use of a two–dimensional approach. For this reason, a three– dimensional computational tool was developed and validated using both presumed and transported pdf methods for the representation of the thermochemistry.
