5|$|By September 1944, Allied {{forces had}} {{successfully}} broken {{out of their}} Normandy beachhead and pursued shattered German forces across Northern France and Belgium. Although Allied commanders generally favoured a broad front policy to continue the advance into Germany and the Netherlands, Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery proposed a bold plan to <b>head</b> <b>north</b> through the Dutch Gelderland, bypassing the German Siegfried Line defences and opening a route into the German industrial heartland of the Ruhr. Initially proposed as a British and Polish operation codenamed Operation Comet, the plan was soon expanded to involve most of the First Allied Airborne Army and a set piece ground advance into the Netherlands, codenamed Market Garden.|$|E

5|$|The {{depression}} {{moved slowly}} to the north-northwest through {{a break in the}} subtropical ridge, and as convective banding features became more prominent the system intensified into Tropical Storm Beryl. Throughout much of its duration, the storm tracked through an environment with light vertical wind shear and well-established upper-level outflow. Shortly after becoming a tropical storm, the low-level circulation of Beryl became exposed with limited deep convection, though deep convection re-developed the following morning. Outflow continued to improve, and with warm sea surface temperatures Beryl gradually intensified to attain peak winds of 60mph (95km/h) early on July 20 while located about 120miles (190km) east of Nags <b>Head,</b> <b>North</b> Carolina.|$|E

5|$|Early in {{the season}} — nearly two months earlier than the first storm {{formation}} in 2004 — a low-pressure area formed and persisted north of Honduras. Despite significant shear, the low managed to become Tropical Depression One on June 8 just north of Honduras. The depression began to <b>head</b> <b>north</b> towards western Cuba that day, but {{as it was a}} very large and poorly organized system under the influence of heavy shear, the official forecasts from the National Hurricane Center emphasized that the route the storm would take was uncertain. Despite this uncertainty, the official forecasts were highly accurate in predicting the storm's track. As the shear dropped, the depression strengthened further and it became Tropical Storm Arlene on June 9. It produced precipitation over a very wide area; the Cayman Islands reported tropical storm-force winds and heavy rain over 150 statute miles (240km) east of the center. Arlene crossed the western tip of Cuba on the morning of June 10 with 50mph (85km/h) winds. Tropical Storm Arlene had an unusual structure throughout its life, with a large circulation containing numerous small centers rotating about a larger gyre, as opposed to an inner convective core.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, {{plans were}} made for US 140 to be decommissioned, with MD 97 to replace the section between Westminster and the Pennsylvania border, where it would connect to PA 97. This {{proposal}} was made in order to eliminate short routes from the U.S. Highway System. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials approved {{the removal of the}} US 140 designation on October 28, 1977. On January 1, 1979, MD 97 was rerouted at Westminster to <b>head</b> <b>north</b> to the Pennsylvania border, replacing US 140. At the Pennsylvania border, the route connected to PA 97, which replaced the US 140 designation in Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, the former alignment of MD 97 between Westminster and the Pennsylvania border northwest of Emmitsburg became a part of MD 140. Dualization of MD 97 in Montgomery County was extended further north from MD 28 to MD 108 by 1989. There are plans to build an interchange at the route’s intersection with Randolph Road in order to improve movements for automobiles as well as for pedestrians and bicycles accessing the nearby Glenmont Metro station. Another new interchange was built with MD 200 (Intercounty Connector) north of MD 28 and opened on February 23, 2011.|$|E

Immediately following a single-point urban interchange (SPUI) at 3200 West, the freeway intersects I-215 {{in the form of}} a cloverleaf interchange. The road dips to the south slightly and, following two SPUIs at Redwood Road (SR-68) and 900 West, the freeway terminates at the Spaghetti Bowl interchange, giving eastbound motorists on SR-201 the option of continuing to I-15, I-80, 1300 South and 900 South. However, an eastbound traveler wanting to continue on the surface portion of SR-201 to State Street must exit on 900 West, <b>head</b> <b>north</b> briefly and then turn eastbound on 2100 South; a westbound traveler on 2100 South wishing to connect to the freeway must take an on-ramp from the surface street just before 900 West.
