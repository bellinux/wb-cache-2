5|$|Day's {{origins and}} the events of his early life remain obscure. Scholars <b>have</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> Day {{was born and raised}} in Dunwich, but there is no direct {{evidence}} that proves this claim. He may have been in London by 1540, as his name is mentioned in a city deposition as being a former servant of the printer and physician Thomas Raynalde. In 1546, he was probably one of twenty men who were granted the freedom of the city by redemption to work for the Stringers' Company of London.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unknown}} how {{effective}} the Caesar cipher {{was at the}} time, but {{it is likely to}} have been reasonably secure, not least because most of Caesar's enemies would have been illiterate and others would <b>have</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> the messages were written in an unknown foreign language. There is no record at that time of any techniques for the solution of simple substitution ciphers. The earliest surviving records date to the 9th century works of Al-Kindi in the Arab world with the discovery of frequency analysis.|$|E

5|$|Neither treaty {{made any}} {{provision}} {{as to the}} mode or {{manner in which the}} removal of the Indians or surrender of the reservations was to take place. The grantees <b>have</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> they were authorized to take forcible possession of the two reservations, or of the four, as the case would have been under the first treaty. The plaintiff in this case was expelled by force; and unless this mode of removal can be sustained, the recovery against the defendants for the trespass was right, and must be affirmed.|$|E
5|$|The St. Edmund {{memorial}} coins were minted {{in great}} quantities {{by a group}} of more than 70 moneyers, many of whom appear to have originated from continental Europe: over 1800 specimens were found when the great Cuerdale Hoard was discovered in Lancashire in 1840. The memorial coins were widely used within the Danelaw. Coins have mainly been found in the east of England, but the exact location of any of the mints they came from is not known with certainty, although scholars <b>have</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> they were made in East Anglia.|$|E
5|$|Descartes {{argued that}} God's {{existence}} can be deduced from his nature, just as geometric ideas can be deduced {{from the nature}} of shapes—he used the deduction of the sizes of angles in a triangle as an example. He suggested {{that the concept of}} God is that of a supremely perfect being, holding all perfections. He seems to <b>have</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> existence is a predicate of a perfection. Thus, if the notion of God did not include existence, it would not be supremely perfect, as it would be lacking a perfection. Consequently, the notion of a supremely perfect God who does not exist, Descartes argues, is unintelligible. Therefore, according to his nature, God must exist.|$|E

5|$|The Maryland colony {{was founded}} by Cecil Calvert in 1634. Like his father George Calvert, who had {{originated}} the efforts {{that led to the}} colony's charter, Cecil Calvert was Catholic at a time when England was dominated by the Anglican Church. The Calverts intended the colony as a haven for Catholics fleeing England and as a source of income for themselves and their descendants. Many of Maryland's first settlers were Catholic, including at least two Catholic priests, one of whom became the earliest chronicler of the colony's history. But whatever Calvert's intentions, Maryland was a colony of an Anglican nation. Its charter had been granted by an Anglican king and seems to <b>have</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> the Church of England would be its official church. Anglican and later Puritan newcomers quickly came to outnumber the early Catholic settlers. Thus, by 1649 when the law was passed, the colonial assembly was dominated by Protestants, and the law was in effect an act of Protestant tolerance for Catholics, rather than the reverse.|$|E
25|$|The friendship, however, did not last. Xiao, fearing for {{the safety}} of his family during the Cultural Revolution, {{destroyed}} all the letters he had received from Forster and asked Forster not to contact him again. Because Forster might <b>have</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> Xiao was ignoring him, he burned some of the letters he had kept as a memento of their friendship.|$|E
25|$|Seascape {{is set on}} a {{beach in}} a time {{contemporary}} with the writing of the play. Though it is unstated in the text, several critics <b>have</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> the action takes place somewhere on the east coast of the United States. All of the play is confined to one afternoon. This physical setting emphasizes the transitional state of the characters' lives. It is one of many symbols in the play.|$|E

25|$|Finally, Custer may <b>have</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> in {{the event}} of his encountering Native Americans, his {{subordinate}} Benteen with the pack train would quickly come to his aid. Rifle volleys were a standard way of telling supporting units to come to another unit's aid. In a subsequent official 1879 Army investigation requested by Major Reno, the Reno Board of Inquiry (RCOI), Benteen and Reno's men testified that they heard distinct rifle volleys as late as 4:30pm during the battle.|$|E
25|$|Some writers <b>have</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> the Irish in 19th-century North America were impoverished. DiMatteo (1992), using {{evidence}} from probate records in 1892, shows this is untrue. Irish-born and Canadian-born Irish accumulated wealth {{in a similar}} way, and that being Irish was not an economic disadvantage by the 1890s. Immigrants from earlier decades may well have experienced greater economic difficulties, but in general the Irish in Ontario in the 1890s enjoyed levels of wealth commensurate {{with the rest of}} the populace.|$|E
25|$|They produce large mucus webs to filter-feed on {{phytoplankton}} {{but also}} small zooplankton. They eat the web with the captured prey and then re-reproduce a web net. The web {{is large and}} spherical {{and it is difficult}} to see during the day because of diffuse reflection. Webs are easier to see at night. Limacina helicina is easily disturbed (like all other Thecosomata); when disturbed, it retracts into its shell and destroys its web. Gilmer & Harbison (1991) <b>have</b> <b>assumed,</b> <b>that</b> Limacina helicina feeds while motionless (without actively swimming). Its web enables them neutral buoyancy or allow them slow sinking only.|$|E

25|$|Note that in {{this example}} we <b>have</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> {{temperature}} is low enough that heat capacities are not influenced by molecular vibration (see heat capacity). However, vibrational modes simply cause gammas which decrease toward 1, since vibration modes in a polyatomic gas gives the gas additional ways to store heat which do not affect temperature, and thus do not affect molecular velocity and sound velocity. Thus, the effect of higher temperatures and vibrational heat capacity acts to increase {{the difference between the}} speed of sound in monatomic vs. polyatomic molecules, with the speed remaining greater in monatomics.|$|E
25|$|Constitutionally (in Article 160 of the Constitution of Malaysia), one of {{the four}} tests for {{entitlement}} to the privileges accorded to a Malaysian Malay is that one must be a Muslim. The rationale for this is that Islam is considered intrinsic to Malay ethnic identity, which culturally and historically is ruled by a Sultan who is a Muslim. Another test is that one must follow the Malay culture. Controversially, court rulings <b>have</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> all ethnic Malays must automatically satisfy this constitutional definition of a Malaysian Malay, and have therefore concluded that they must satisfy all of its requirements, so they have to be Muslim.|$|E
25|$|Old Norse had {{a stress}} accent which {{fell on the}} first syllable. Several {{scholars}} have proposed that Proto-Norse also had a separate pitch accent, which was inherited from Proto-Indo-European and has evolved into the tonal accents of modern Swedish and Norwegian, which in turn have evolved into the stød of modern Danish. Another recently advanced theory is that each Proto-Norse long syllable and every other short syllable received stress, marked by pitch, eventually leading {{to the development of}} the Swedish and Norwegian tonal accent distinction. Finally, quite a number of linguists <b>have</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> even the first phonetic rudiments of the distinction didn't appear until the Old Norse period.|$|E

25|$|Many authors <b>have</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> plug-in {{recharging}} {{will take}} place overnight at home. However, residents of cities, apartments, dormitories, and townhouses might not have garages or driveways with available power outlets, and they might {{be less likely to}} buy plug-ins unless recharging infrastructure is developed. Electrical outlets or charging stations near their places of residence, or in commercial or public parking lots or streets or workplaces are required for these potential users to gain the full advantage of PHEVs. Even house dwellers might need to charge at the office or to take advantage of opportunity charging at shopping centers. However, this infrastructure is not in place today and it will require investments by both the private and public sectors.|$|E
25|$|The {{backward}} reclining {{figure of}} the chacmool presents a defenceless, passive appearance and has been likened by Miller to the positioning of captives in Classic period Maya sculpture and painting. Bent elbows and knees are common in depictions of Maya captives; the full-frontal view of the face is rare in Maya art except among representations of captives. The form of the Chichen Itza chacmools lacks the typical traits of Maya deities and most scholars <b>have</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> the iconography of Maya chacmools is equivalent {{to that of the}} central Mexican examples. Eduard Seler commented in the early 1960s that chacmools in Chichen Itza tended to be located in temple antechambers, where the bowl or disc gripped by the figure served to receive pulque as an offering.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} authors <b>have</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> the {{surviving}} tower remnant equates to a distinctive part of Grose's engraving however the thickness at nearly 3 metres {{and the other}} features of this clearly later building together with map evidence suggests otherwise and in addition the OS map evidence suggests a typical square or oblong tower castle shaped building rather than a relatively unfortified laird's house with comparatively thin walls, many doors at ground level akin to buildings such as the Place of Auchinleck. The footprint of Corshill House {{as shown by the}} engraving also seems far too large for the knoll on which the surviving remnant of Old Corsehill Castle still stands. Oddly the 1779 map by Crawford does not indisputably show Corsehill as a ruin although by this time the lands of Cocklebie have extended across the once prestigious avenue of trees.|$|E
