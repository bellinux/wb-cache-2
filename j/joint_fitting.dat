Using cosmological N-body {{simulations}} {{we study}} the line-ofsight velocity distribution {{of dark matter}} haloes focusing on the lowestorder even moments, dispersion and kurtosis, and their application to estimate the mass profiles of cosmological structures.

The coronal temperature structure and abundances have been derived from multi-temperature fitting and confirmed by a differential emission measure analysis. The corona as seen by ASCA is essentially isothermal with a temperature around 0. 3 keV, consistent with the evolutionary picture of coronae of aging solar-type stars. A comparison between the measurements from various instruments indicates a source variability in the coronal flux (which precludes the <b>joint</b> <b>fitting</b> of data from different instruments taken at different epochs) and temperature structure consistent with that discovered {{in a series of}} ROSAT observations. The elemental abundances agree with solar photospheric abundances for Ne, Si, and Fe at 1 σ level, while O appears to be underabundant by a factor of about 3 relative to solar photospheric values, and Mg overabundant by a factor of a few.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{physical}} limitations placed on CMB temperature and polarization {{measurements of the}} initial power spectrum by geometric projection, acoustic physics, gravitational lensing and the <b>joint</b> <b>fitting</b> of cosmological parameters. Detailed information on the spectrum is greatly assisted by polarization information and localized to the acoustic regime k = 0. 02 - 0. 2 Mpc^{- 1 } with a fundamental resolution of Delta k/k> 0. 05. From this study we construct principal component based statistics, which are orthogonal to cosmological parameters including the initial amplitude and tilt of the spectrum, that best probe deviations from scale-free initial conditions. These statistics resemble Fourier modes confined to the acoustic regime and ultimately can yield ~ 50 independent measurements of the power spectrum features to percent level precision. They are straightforwardly related to more traditional parameterizations such as the {{the running of the}} tilt and in the future can provide many statistically independent measurements of it for consistency checks.

40|$|The {{combination}} of spectroscopic stellar metallicities and resolved star color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) {{has the potential}} to constrain the entire star formation and chemical enrichment history (SFH) of a galaxy better than fitting CMDs alone (as is most common in SFH studies using resolved stellar populations). In this paper, two approaches for incorporating external metallicity information into color-magnitude diagram fitting techniques are presented. Overall, the <b>joint</b> <b>fitting</b> of metallicity and CMD information can increase the precision on measured age-metallicity relationships and star formation rates by ~ 10 % over CMD fitting alone. However, systematics in stellar isochrones and mismatches between spectroscopic and photometric metallicity determinations can reduce the accuracy of the recovered SFHs. I present a simple mitigation of these systematics that can reduce the amplitude of these systematics to the level obtained from CMD fitting alone, while ensuring the age-metallicity relationship is consistent with spectroscopic metallicities. As is the case in CMD-fitting analysis, improved stellar models and calibrations between spectroscopic and photometric metallicities are currently the primary impediment to gains in SFH precision from jointly fitting stellar metallicities and CMDs.

40|$|The {{discrepancy}} between the amplitudes of matter fluctuations inferred from Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) cluster number counts, the primary temperature, and the polarization anisotropies of {{the cosmic microwave background}} (CMB) measured by the Planck satellite can be reconciled if the local universe is embedded in an under-dense region as shown by Lee, 2014. Here using a simple void model assuming the open Friedmann-Robertson-Walker geometry and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique, we investigate how deep the local under-dense region needs to be to resolve this discrepancy. Such local void, if exists, predicts the local Hubble parameter value that is different from the global Hubble constant.

We show that the inclusion of polarization sensitivity requires <b>joint</b> <b>fitting</b> to three observed spectra, {{one for each of}} the Stoke's parameters, I(E), U(E), and Q(E). The equations for Stoke's I(E) (the total intensity spectrum) are identical to the familiar case with no polarization sensitivity, and for which the model-predicted spectrum is obtained by a convolution of the source spectrum, F(E'), with the familiar energy response function, e(E') *R(E', E), where e(E') and R(E', E) are the effective area and energy redistribution matrix, respectively. In addition to the energy spectrum, the two new relations for U(E) and Q(E) include the source polarization fraction and position angle versus energy, a(E'), and psi'_ 0 (E'), respectively, and the model-predicted spectra for these relations are obtained by a convolution with the "modulated" energy response function, m(E') *e(E') R(E, E'), where m(E') is the energy-dependent modulation fraction that quantifies a polarimeter's angular response to 100 % polarized radiation. We present results of simulations with response parameters appropriate for the proposed PRAXyS Small Explorer observatory to illustrate the procedures and methods, and we discuss some aspects of photoelectric polarimeters with relevance to understanding their calibration and operation.

We want {{to address the question}} whether GRB 111209 A was a special event beyond its extreme duration alone, and whether it is a classical GRB or another kind of high-energy transient. The afterglow may yield significant clues. We present afterglow photometry obtained in seven bands with the GROND imager as well as in further seven bands with the UVOT telescope on-board Swift. The light curve is analysed by multi-band modelling and <b>joint</b> <b>fitting</b> with power-laws and broken power-laws, and we use the contemporaneous GROND data to study the evolution of the spectral energy distribution. We compare the optical afterglow to a large ensemble we have analysed in earlier works, and especially to that of another ultra-long event, GRB 130925 A. We furthermore undertake a photometric study of the host galaxy. We find a strong, chromatic rebrightening event at ≈ 0. 8 days after the GRB, during which the spectral slope becomes redder. After this, the light curve decays achromatically, with evidence for a break at about 9 days after the trigger. The afterglow luminosity is found to not be exceptional. We find that a double-jet model is able to explain the chromatic rebrightening. The afterglow features have been detected in other events and are not unique. The GRB and and afterglow parameters of GRB 111209 A are in agreement with the known distributions for these parameters. While the central engine of this event may differ from classical GRBs, there are multiple lines of evidence pointing to GRB 111209 A to result from the core-collapse of a massive star with a stripped envelope.
