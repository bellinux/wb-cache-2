The first prototype, P1, performed early test flights during {{the first phase of the}} flight test program, during which the handling and attitude of the aircraft were explored and the flight envelope gradually expanded, including autorotation tests and being flown at up to 97 per cent of its maximum <b>internal</b> <b>load</b> takeoff weight. P2 and P3 are the main vehicles for airworthiness certification testing; they are more representative of production aircraft, their design incorporating several refinements that had been made based upon experiences with P1. Following on from EASA certification, Marenco aims to quickly achieve Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification for the North American market as well. Completion of P1 was reportedly delayed by as much as six months due to the late delivery of its engine by Honeywell. In December 2013, the completed P1 was revealed to the public.|$|E

[...] Since the {{directional}} coupler is a linear device, the notations on figure 1 are arbitrary. [...] Any port can be the input, (an example is seen in figure 20) which {{will result in the}} directly connected port being the transmitted port, the adjacent port being the coupled port, and the diagonal port being the isolated port. [...] On some directional couplers, the main line is designed for high power operation (large connectors), while the coupled port may use a small connector, such as an SMA connector.

[...] In figure 20, one signal enters port P3 and one enters port P2, while both exit port P1. [...] The signal from port P3 to port P1 will experience [...] of loss, and the signal from port P2 to port P1 will have [...] loss. [...] The <b>internal</b> <b>load</b> on the isolated port will dissipate the signal losses from port P3 and port P2. [...] If the isolators in figure 20 are neglected, the isolation measurement (port P2 to port P3) determines the amount of power from the signal generator F2 that will be injected into the signal generator F1. [...] As the injection level increases, it may cause modulation of signal generator F1, or even injection phase locking. [...] Because of the symmetry of the directional coupler, the reverse injection will happen with the same possible modulation problems of signal generator F2 by F1. [...] Therefore, the isolators are used in figure 20 to effectively increase the isolation (or directivity) of the directional coupler. [...] Consequently, the injection loss will be {{the isolation of the}} directional coupler plus the reverse isolation of the isolator.|$|E

A best fit paraboloid analysis is used to determine a {{root mean square error}} and defocus from each analysis. The statistical properties of these quantities as well as the <b>internal</b> <b>loads</b> are calculated from the results of many independent analyses.

The <b>internal</b> <b>loads</b> are {{inextricably linked to}} occupant behaviour, both directly through the contribution of occupant heat output to thermal energy balance and indirectly via the interactions between occupants, appliances and building services. While occupancy itself is difficult to measure directly, most buildings possess a wealth of data {{in the form of}} monitored electricity consumption in varying degrees of resolution. These data, particularly plug loads, may be used to inform the model of occupant-related <b>internal</b> <b>loads.</b> Different approaches to parameterisation of plug loads have been investigated, with the purpose of exploring the conditions that might lead to preference of one approach over another.

50|$|Note {{that the}} {{deflections}} necessary {{to develop the}} stresses indicated in a plastic analysis are generally excessive, frequently {{to the point of}} incompatibility with the function of the structure. Therefore, separate analysis may be required to ensure design deflection limits are not exceeded. Also, since working materials into the plastic range can lead to permanent deformation of the structure, additional analyses may be required at limit load to ensure no detrimental permanent deformations occur. The large deflections and stiffness changes usually associated with plastic bending can significantly change the <b>internal</b> <b>load</b> distribution, particularly in statically indeterminate beams.

The problems with eutrophication in Sweden is mainly in the south where agriculture has affected the areas for a long time. Skråmträsket is a lake in north of Sweden who has been affected from anthropogenic activities such as wastewater and runoff from agriculture. The lake has high phosphorus concentrations, originating both from catchment runoff and <b>internal</b> <b>loading</b> from the sediments. Skråmträsket have had algal blooms during the last 20 years. The municipality of Skellefteå and the local water group have collaborated during the last years to mitigate external sources of phosphorus, focusing mainly on the deepest area of the lake. This report’s a continuation of the work and investigates the <b>internal</b> <b>loading</b> of phosphorous in the lake sediments and possible actions to restore the lake. The <b>internal</b> <b>loading</b> tends to be more widespread than previously studies have shown, also the shallow sediment areas tend to show signs of <b>internal</b> <b>loading.</b> The conclusions are based on previous samplings from the lake including own sampling made for this report. As a complement is a literature study done to investigate more about possible methods to restore Skråmträsket. There are two possible methods to proceed with, aluminum treatment of the sediments or bottom water pumping. It’s important that the measure will be long-lived. Therefore, it is important to continue the samplings and expand the areas for sampling. The focus of the actions must include both the deep areas and the shallow areas of the sediment. ...|$|R

40|$|Eutrophication of the Baltic Sea has {{potentially}} {{increased the}} frequency and magnitude of cyanobacteria blooms. Eutrophication leads to increased sedimentation of organic material, increasing the Extent of anoxic bottoms and subsequently increasing the <b>internal</b> phosphorus <b>loading.</b> In addition, the hypoxic water volume displays a negative relationship with the total dissolved inorganic nitrogen pool, suggesting greater overall nitrogen removal with increased hypoxia. Enhanced <b>internal</b> <b>loading</b> of phosphorus {{and the removal of}} dissolved inorganic nitrogen leads to lower nitrogen to phosphorus ratios, which are one of the main factors promoting nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria blooms. Because cyanobacteria blooms in the open waters of the Baltic Sea seem to be strongly regulated by internal processes, the effects of external nutrient reductions are scale-dependent. During longer time scales, reductions in external phosphorus load may reduce cyanobacteria blooms; however, on shorter time scales the <b>internal</b> phosphorus <b>loading</b> can counteract external phosphorus reductions. The coupled processes inducing <b>internal</b> <b>loading,</b> nitrogen removal, and the prevalence of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria can qualitatively be described as a potentially self-sustaining "vicious circle.

In this study a geometrically accurate, nonlinear finite element model of C 0 –C 7 was developed using CT images of the human cervical spine. This model was used to derive the moment–rotation responses of the cervical spine, under physiological moments of 0. 33, 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5 and 2. 0 Nm for flexion/extension in the sagittal plane, lateral bending in the frontal plane and axial rotation. Moreover, {{the results from the}} finite element model were used to calculate muscle forces that contribute in equilibrium of the head during rotations in the sagittal and frontal planes. To achieve this, a biomechanical model and the optimization algorithm were used to determine the relationship between required muscle forces and neck angle for the quasi-static condition.
