As far as the association between economic performance and pollution <b>disclosures</b> is concerned, the results show that the subgroup of large firms with poor economic performance provides the most detailed pollution information.

40|$|In {{this study}} we examine the {{relationship}} between the auditor’s going concern opinion and management’s forward-looking <b>disclosures</b> in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section of 10 -K filings. The research objective is two-fold and addresses whether the presence of a going concern opinion is associated with (1) the quantity of forward-looking <b>disclosures</b> and (2) the clarity of the forward-looking <b>disclosures.</b> We examine MD&A <b>disclosures</b> from a sample of 2, 365 financially distressed companies over the fiscal years 2010 - 2014 and find that while the absolute number of forward-looking <b>disclosures</b> is lower for companies receiving a going concern opinion, the proportion of forward-looking <b>disclosures</b> in the MD&A is greater {{in the presence of a}} going concern opinion. We also find that the forward-looking <b>disclosures</b> are clearer communications, as evidenced by the use of less equivocation, when the company receives a going concern opinion. In addition, we find that forward-looking <b>disclosures</b> are significantly different for first-time versus continuing going concern opinions. In sum, our results suggest generally improved forward-looking <b>disclosures</b> in MD&A when companies receive a going concern opinion from their auditor...|$|R

5|$|If an {{employee}} does {{make such a}} <b>disclosure,</b> Section 2 inserts a new Section 47B, providing that the employee shall suffer no detriment in their employment as a result. This includes both negative actions {{and the absence of}} action, and as such covers discipline, dismissal, or failing to gain a pay rise or access to facilities which would otherwise have been provided. If {{an employee}} does suffer a detriment, he is permitted to make a complaint before an employment tribunal under Section 3. In front of an employment tribunal, the law is amended in Sections 4 and 5 to provide compensation, and to reverse the burden of proof; if an employee has been dismissed for making a protected <b>disclosure,</b> this dismissal is automatically considered unfair. Similarly, under Section 6, an employee cannot be given priority when discussing redundancies simply because he made such a <b>disclosure.</b> These sections take into account Section 7, which notes that there is no requirement of age or length of employment before they come into effect.|$|E

40|$|Our paper {{focuses on}} {{corporate}} social responsibility (CSR) <b>disclosures</b> made by 98 listed companies, across industries. Content analysis methodology was used.

The present study fills this gap in the literature. The sample selectedcomprises a representative cross-section of the industrial sectors in the Main Board of the KLSE. Previous studies have used ad-hoc samples, which limits the generalizability of the findings. Findings from the study suggest that the <b>disclosures</b> have a public-relations bias, with a very general, ‘good news’ type of <b>disclosures</b> being the norm. Consistent with prior studies in other developing countries, quantitative or monetary <b>disclosures,</b> as well as ‘bad news’ <b>disclosures</b> are minimal.

40|$|International audienceInformation risk – the {{uncertainty}} regarding {{the parameters of}} the distribution of firms’ future cash flows – generates valuation errors and is costly to investors who require a higher return to compensate for greater information risk. We argue that, on average, through their impairment-testing <b>disclosures,</b> managers convey information that reduces information risk. Using <b>disclosures</b> from firms included in the SBF 250 index of Euronext Paris over the period 2006 – 2009, we document a negative association between impairment-testing <b>disclosures</b> and implied cost of equity capital. We find that prospective entity-specific impairment-testing <b>disclosures</b> are negatively associated with cost of capital whereas descriptive <b>disclosures</b> exhibit no association with cost of capital. Additionally, we document that firms which avoid booking impairments when low performance indicators suggest a greater likelihood of impairments exhibit no association between impairment-testing <b>disclosures</b> and cost of capital. This suggests that those firms’ <b>disclosures</b> are perceived as less accurate by investors. We also find that prospective impairment-testing <b>disclosures</b> are negatively related to analysts’ forecast errors. Our study adds to the literature on the economic consequences of financial reporting and sheds light on the consequences of one accounting mechanism, namely impairment-testing <b>disclosures,</b> ensuring conservatism of financial reporting...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{corporate}} social <b>disclosures</b> practices of Spanish firms. Annual reports of 41 Spanish firms for the year 2007 were analysed to determine the level of corporate social <b>disclosures</b> (CSD), industry differences in CSD and the effect of financial performance on the quality of <b>disclosures.</b> Results show that Spanish firms disclose most information on governance followed by products and services. Differences in <b>disclosures</b> made by various industry groups were observed suggesting that each industry group has certain preferences in disclosing information to their stakeholders. No significant relationship between financial performance and corporate social <b>disclosures</b> for Spanish companies was observed. This research suggests that CSR <b>disclosures</b> by Spanish firms are influenced by government regulations. The customers are other group of influential stakeholders.

40|$|Despite its {{contribution}} to the economy, the resources sector faces growing pressure from stakeholders, including investors and regulators, for managing {{the environmental impacts of}} its operations. Being an environmentally sensitive sector, resource sector companies should provide <b>disclosures</b> of their environmental footprint in their annual and/or sustainability reports. However, it is claimed that, given that environmental <b>disclosures</b> in annual and sustainability reports are largely voluntary, the quality of those <b>disclosures</b> are questionable with respect to their relevance and faithful representation. Therefore, the overall objective of this thesis was to explore the quality of environmental <b>disclosures</b> by Australian resources sector companies. This was undertaken through an assessment of quality based on existing reporting frameworks and assessment of investors’ perspectives on the quality of <b>disclosures.</b> Thus, the aim of the project was twofold: first, to identify the extent to which corporate environmental <b>disclosures</b> align with the quality attributes suggested in established regulatory guidelines and frameworks; and second, to obtain investors’ perspectives regarding corporate environmental initiatives and environmental <b>disclosures...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates how the {{characteristics}} of information security incidents and <b>disclosures</b> in financial reports affect the valuation of a firm. Building on theories of <b>disclosures</b> in the accounting literature, we investigate investor reaction to <b>disclosures</b> through both quantitative and qualitative analyses. A cross-sectional analysis is first performed to {{examine the effect of}} the number of <b>disclosures</b> on stock price reactions to information security incidents. The results suggest that information security risk factors disclosed in financial reports increases the impact of information security incidents. Such an observation is consistent with investors perceiving the <b>disclosures</b> as a warning of future incidents. In order to provide a richer interpretation of the results, we further explore the contents of the <b>disclosures</b> using text mining techniques. One of the key findings is that breached firms react to information security incidents by disclosing additional and more specific risk factors. We further build a model to link <b>disclosures</b> with different stock price reactions to information security incidents to provide insights into how companies should disclose security concerns and practices. The model suggests that the <b>disclosures</b> associated with non-negative reactions are more generic and includ...|$|R
