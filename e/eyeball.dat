5|$|Laboratory {{tests have}} shown that the human <b>eyeball</b> is far too rigid to spontaneously change shape to a degree that would be {{necessary}} to accomplish what Bates described. Exceedingly small changes in axial length of the <b>eyeball</b> (18.6–19.2 micrometres) are caused by the action of the ciliary muscle during accommodation. However, these changes are far too small to account for the necessary changes in focus, producing changes of only −0.036 dioptres.|$|E
5|$|Some {{cases of}} {{nearsightedness}} {{are recognized as}} due to a transient spasm of the ciliary muscle, rather than a misshapen <b>eyeball.</b> These are classed as pseudomyopia, of which spontaneous reversal may account for some reports of improvement.|$|E
5|$|This is a {{hardy breed}} with few breed {{specific}} health problems. The main hereditary problem {{highlighted by the}} American Sealyham Terrier Club is an eye condition called lens luxation, for which there are DNA tests. Lens luxation is {{a condition in which}} the lens slips out of position in the <b>eyeball</b> due to the weakening of the fibers that holds it in place.|$|E
50|$|Hearts must be {{collected}} here, <b>eyeballs</b> serve as stones. Enemies include skulls, and palette-swapped butterflies (these give out hearts when killed). Two worm-like characters will also appear here: a bony one, which turns hearts to <b>eyeballs</b> and <b>eyeballs</b> to skulls, {{and a healthy}} meaty one which turns skulls back to <b>eyeballs</b> and <b>eyeballs</b> to hearts.|$|R
50|$|These {{dances and}} !kia may also {{contribute}} to the healer's sense of self. As K"au fDau, a blind healer told Professor Katz:“God keeps my <b>eyeballs</b> in a little cloth bag. When he first collected them, he got a little cloth bag and plucked my <b>eyeballs</b> out and put them into the bag and then he tied the <b>eyeballs</b> to his belt and went up to heaven. And now when I dance, on the nights when I dance and the singing rises up, he comes down from heaven swinging the bag with the <b>eyeballs</b> above my head and then he lowers the <b>eyeballs</b> to my eye level, and as the singing gets strong, he puts the <b>eyeballs</b> into my sockets and they stay there and I cure. And then when the women stop singing and separate out, he removes the <b>eyeballs,</b> puts them back in the cloth bag and takes them up to heaven.”So during the !kia state, this man says he can see, both figuratively and literally.|$|R

5|$|Neck {{stiffness}} usually presents {{six hours}} after initial onset of SAH. Isolated dilation of a pupil {{and loss of}} the pupillary light reflex may reflect brain herniation {{as a result of}} rising intracranial pressure (pressure inside the skull). Intraocular hemorrhage (bleeding into the <b>eyeball)</b> may occur in response to the raised pressure: subhyaloid hemorrhage (bleeding under the hyaloid membrane, which envelops the vitreous body of the eye) and vitreous hemorrhage may be visible on fundoscopy. This is known as Terson syndrome (occurring in 3–13 percent of cases) and is more common in more severe SAH.|$|E
5|$|An {{increase}} in intracranial pressure {{may lead to}} impairment of the optic nerves (II) due to compression of the surrounding veins and capillaries, causing swelling of the <b>eyeball</b> (papilloedema). A cancer, such as an optic glioma, may also impact the optic nerve (II). A pituitary tumour may compress the optic tracts or the optic chiasm of the optic nerve (II), leading to visual field loss. A pituitary tumour may also extend into the cavernous sinus, compressing the oculuomotor nerve (III), trochlear nerve (IV) and abducens nerve (VI), leading to double-vision and strabismus. These nerves may also be affected by herniation of the temporal lobes of the brain through the falx cerebri.|$|E
5|$|Damage to nerves III, IV, or VI {{may affect}} the {{movement}} of the <b>eyeball</b> (globe). Both or one eye may be affected; in either case double vision (diplopia) will likely occur because the movements of the eyes are no longer synchronized. Nerves III, IV and VI are tested by observing how the eye follows an object in different directions. This object may be a finger or a pin, and may be moved at different directions to test for pursuit velocity. If the eyes do not work together, the most likely cause is damage to a specific cranial nerve or its nuclei.|$|E
50|$|Monsters {{are found}} roaming {{the field in}} the form of flying <b>eyeballs,</b> which trigger battle {{sequences}} when the character comes into contact with them. These <b>eyeballs</b> chase after the on-screen character if he/she comes into the eyeballs' view.|$|R
5000|$|One {{belief is}} that McDonald's uses cow <b>eyeballs</b> in its products, {{permitting}} it to brand them as [...] "100% beef". However, the USDA mandates that all beef by-products, including cow <b>eyeballs,</b> be appropriately labeled. McDonald's, has asserted that its products contain [...] "100% pure USDA inspected beef; no additives, no fillers, no extenders." [...] In addition, cow <b>eyeballs</b> are actually {{more expensive than the}} more commonly eaten cow parts, due to demand from scientific institutions for experiments.|$|R

5|$|Eye {{conditions}} which affect the Parson Russell Terrier include primary lens luxation, a heritable condition. This disease causes the zonular fibres to be abnormal {{and begin to}} disintegrate in affected dogs. The fibres support {{the lens of the}} eye, and their destruction can cause the lens to fall into the wrong location within the eye. If the lens falls into the anterior chamber of <b>eyeball</b> then a secondary glaucoma can occur, causing loss of vision. National kennel associations such as the Kennel Club (UK) publish DNA screening results on Parson Russell Terriers, broken down into three groups; clears, carriers, and affecteds.|$|E
5|$|The album package {{consists}} of 156 Polaroid photos that unfold into a 2×2 square. The Polaroid photos are seemingly random. One {{of the photos}} featured on the front cover is the <b>eyeball</b> of Dennis Rodman, former Chicago Bulls player and friend of the band, while another photo is of Vedder's foot {{after he had been}} stung by a stingray. The pictures, when viewed from afar, blend to form the No Code triangle/eyeball logo that is the theme throughout the album. The CD and vinyl came with lyrics printed on the back of replica Polaroids. Only nine Polaroids came in a set, leaving one to have to obtain another set to accumulate all thirteen songs.|$|E
5|$|When {{the bust}} was first discovered, no piece of quartz to {{represent}} the iris of the left <b>eyeball</b> was present, as in the other eye, and none was found despite an intensive search and a then significant reward of £5 being put up for information regarding its whereabouts. Borchardt assumed that the quartz iris of the left eye had fallen out when the sculptor Thutmose's workshop fell into ruin. The missing eye led to speculation that Nefertiti may have suffered from an ophthalmic infection, and actually lost her left eye, though {{the presence of an}} iris in other statues of her contradicted this possibility.|$|E

5|$|The {{senses of}} Psittacosaurus can be {{inferred}} from the endocast. Large olfactory bulbs are present, indicating the genus had an acute sense of smell. The size of these bulbs are comparable to large predatory theropods, although they likely evolved to avoid predators instead of to seek out prey. The sclerotic rings in reptiles directly show {{the size of the}} <b>eyeball.</b> The rings are not well preserved in Psittacosaurus, with one individual preserving them likely contracted postmortem, but if they {{are similar to those of}} Protoceratops, Psittacosaurus would have had large eyes and acute vision. The curvature of the semicircular canals is related to the agility of reptiles, and the large curved canals in Psittacosaurus show that the genus was much more agile than later ceratopsians. Comparisons between the scleral rings of Psittacosaurus and modern birds and reptiles suggest that it may have been cathemeral, active throughout the day and for short intervals at night.|$|E
25|$|A {{common cause}} of low visual acuity is {{refractive}} error (ametropia), or errors in how the light is refracted in the <b>eyeball.</b> Causes of refractive errors include aberrations {{in the shape of}} the <b>eyeball,</b> the shape of the cornea, and reduced flexibility of the lens. Too high or too low refractive error (in relation to the length of the <b>eyeball)</b> is the cause of nearsightedness (myopia) or farsightedness (hyperopia) (normal refractive status is referred to as emmetropia). Other optical causes are astigmatism or more complex corneal irregularities. These anomalies can mostly be corrected by optical means (such as eyeglasses, contact lenses, laser surgery, etc.).|$|E

The 'Ceasefire' not always honored, found the Battalion in trenches, in <b>eyeball</b> to <b>eyeball</b> contact with Pakistani Forward Defended Localities (FDLs), along the Sialkot Railway line. In some areas the FDLs were a mere 20 meters apart, and C Company could hear Pakistan soldiers talking, and even smoking the hookah in their trenches and bunkers.|$|E
