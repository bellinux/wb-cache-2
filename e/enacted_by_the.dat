5|$|Early 20th-century weight limits were enacted {{to protect}} dirt and gravel roads from {{damage caused by}} the solid wheels of heavy trucks. As time passed, truck weight limits focused {{primarily}} on gross weight limits (which had no prescribed limits on length). By 1974, bridges received special protection from increasing truck weight limits. The bridge formula law was <b>enacted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Congress to limit the weight-to-length ratio of heavy trucks, and to protect roads and bridges from {{the damage caused by}} the concentrated weight of shorter trucks. The formula effectively lowers the legal weight limit for shorter trucks, preventing them from causing premature deterioration of bridges and highway infrastructure.|$|E

5|$|The Hortensian Law {{deprived}} the patricians {{of their}} last weapon against the plebeians, and thus resolved the last great political question of the era. No such important political changes occurred between 287 BC and 133 BC. The important laws of this era were still <b>enacted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> senate. In effect, the plebeians {{were satisfied with the}} possession of power, but did not care to use it. The senate was supreme during this era because the era was dominated by questions of foreign and military policy. This was the most militarily active era of the Roman Republic.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish Parliament {{can give}} {{legislative}} consent over devolved matters {{back to the}} UK Parliament by passing a Legislative Consent Motion if United Kingdom-wide legislation is considered more appropriate for a certain issue.

For instance, university education and care services for the elderly are free at point of use in Scotland, while fees are paid in the rest of the UK.

Article 18 prohibits the State from conferring any titles other than military or academic distinctions, and the citizens of India cannot accept titles from a foreign state. Thus, Indian aristocratic titles and title of nobility conferred by the British have been abolished.
