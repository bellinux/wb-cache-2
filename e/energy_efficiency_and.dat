5|$|Following the 2011 Japanese nuclear accidents, Germany's federal {{government}} {{is working on a}} new plan for increasing <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>and</b> renewable energy commercialization, with a particular focus on offshore wind farms. Under the plan, large wind turbines will be erected far away from the coastlines, where the wind blows more consistently than it does on land, and where the enormous turbines won't bother the inhabitants. The plan aims to decrease Germany's dependence on energy derived from coal and nuclear power plants.|$|E

Drivers are trained in techniques to achieve maximum <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency,</b> <b>and</b> lighting has been minimised; the provider of the bulk of the energy for the Channel Tunnel has been switched to nuclear power stations in France.|$|E
5|$|Considerable debate exists {{about the}} size of the rebound in <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>and</b> the {{relevance}} of the Jevons paradox to energy conservation. Some dismiss the paradox, while others worry that it may be self-defeating to pursue sustainability by increasing energy efficiency. Environmental economists have proposed that efficiency gains be coupled with conservation policies that keep the cost of use the same (or higher) to avoid the Jevons paradox. Conservation policies (such as cap and trade) do not display the paradox, and can be used to control the rebound effect.|$|E

5|$|The 7000 {{series of}} cars, {{currently}} being built by Kawasaki Heavy Industries Rolling Stock Company of Kobe, Japan are being delivered for on-site testing during winter 2013, and first entered service April 14, 2015 on the Blue Line. The new cars {{are different from}} previous models in that while still operating as married pairs, the cab in one car was eliminated, {{turning it into a}} B car. The new design allows for increased passenger capacity, elimination of redundant equipment, greater <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency,</b> <b>and</b> lower maintenance costs. The National Transportation Safety Board investigation of the fatal June 22, 2009, accident led it to conclude that the 1000 series cars are unsafe and unable to protect passengers in a crash. As a result, on July 26, 2010, Metro voted to purchase 300 7000 series cars to replace the remaining 1000 series cars. An additional 128 7000 series cars were also ordered to serve the new Silver Line to Dulles Airport (64 for each phase). In May 2013, Metro placed another order for 100 7000 series cars, which will replace all of the 4000 series cars. On July 13, 2015, WMATA used their final option and purchased an additional 220 7000 series railcars for fleet expansion, bringing the total number of 7000 series railcars on order to 748.|$|E
