40|$|Aims:We {{investigate}} the abundance distributions of silicon and iron {{on the surface}} of HR 7224 and check for the presence of magnetic fields. We try further to find an explanation for the observed Balmer line variations, alternative to that by surface temperature gradients given in a previous article. Methods: Based on time series of more than 570 high resolution spectra we {{investigate the}} abundance distribution of silicon and iron using the Doppler Imaging technique applying two independent program codes and using single and multiple components atmosphere models. We further calculate the combined effect of abundance changes of Si, Fe, and He on the Hβ line profile and compare it with the observations. The mean longitudinal magnetic field strength of HR 7224 is measured spectropolarimetrically. Results: The Doppler Imaging analysis of HR 7224 shows the presence of large silicon and <b>iron</b> <b>spots</b> on the star's surface, large gradients of the abundances of these elements, and hints to enhanced line strengths near the visible pole of the star. The explanation of the observed Balmer line variations by inhomogeneous abundance distributions alone requires unrealistic large gradients of the helium abundance. Magnetic field measurements gave no definite results, a field strength of the order of + 400 G is likely. Conclusions: We can exclude the hypothesis that the hydrogen line profile variations of HR 7224 are caused by inhomogeneous abundance distributions of Fe, Si, and He alone or by pressure gradients like in the case of Ap stars. Still the observed variations can be described only by the combined effect of abundance and temperature gradients. In this case, the derived Doppler imaging maps will reflect also the temperature gradients and the surface will be cooler in regions of enhanced line strength like at the visible pole. At present state, the physical origin of possible surface temperature gradients remains unknown. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|Stainless steels are {{corrosion-resistant}} by nature, {{which might}} suggest that passivating them would be unnecessary. However, stainless steels are not completely impervious to rusting. One common mode of corrosion in corrosion-resistant steels is when small spots on the surface begin to rust because grain boundaries or embedded bits of foreign matter (such as grinding swarf) allow water molecules to oxidize some of the <b>iron</b> in those <b>spots</b> despite the alloying chromium. This is called rouging. Some grades of stainless steel are especially resistant to rouging; parts made from them may therefore forgo any passivation step, depending on engineering decisions.|$|R

5000|$|Wau {{is a town}} in New Guinea, in the {{province}} of Morobe situated {{at one end of the}} Wau-Bulolo Valley. It was the site of a gold rush during the 1920s and 1930s. Gold prospectors arrived at the coast at Salamaua and struggled inland along the Black Cat Track. The miners partially cleared the area and built houses and workshops, and established a water supply and an electricity grid. They constructed the aerodromes at Wau and Bulolo which were the primary means of reaching the Wau-Bulolo Valley. Wau aerodrome was a rough Kunai grass airstrip 3100 ft in length with a 10 per cent slope heading directly for Mount Kaindi. Aircraft could approach from the north east only, landing uphill and taking off downhill. The mountain at the end of the runway prevented second attempts at landing and precluded extension of the strip. Pilots had to manoeuvre Dakotas under clouds and through dangerous passes, [...] "dodging a peak here and cloud there", landing at high speeds. This required good visibility, but the weather over Owen Stanley Range was characterised by frequent storms, vertical drafts, and mists which rose from the jungle floor. The first landing at Wau was made by Ernest Mustard in his De Havilland DH.37 on 19 April 1927. Osmar White, who reached Wau in June 1942, wrote: and Bulolo were towns built sole by virtue of man's conquest of the air. Every nail, sheet of <b>iron,</b> weatherboard, <b>spot</b> of paint, pane of glass, crock, wire or sheet of paper was carried in by air at freight rates between 4d and 1/5d per pound. The wrecked trucks that now dotted the highways, rusted out and twisted by fire, were brought in by air. The billiard tables at the hotels were brought in by air. Easy chairs, refrigerators, bathtubs, stoves, dynamos, linoleum, carpets, garden statuary, even great mining dredges, bulldozers and power shovels—all were brought in by air, and this in a decade when most people in Australia were still thinking it adventurous to take a five-minute joy ride over an airfield.|$|R

The way by which macrophages manage non-heme iron at physiological concentration is still not fully understood. We investigated protein changes in mouse bone marrow macrophages incubated with ferric ammonium citrate (FAC 10 μM <b>iron).</b> Differentially expressed <b>spots</b> were identified by nano RP-HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. Transcriptomic, metabolomics and western immunoblotting analyses complemented the proteomic approach. Pattern analysis was also used for identifying networks of proteins involved in iron homeostasis. FAC treatment resulted in higher abundance of several proteins including ferritins, cytoskeleton related proteins, glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) at the membrane level, vimentin, arginase, galectin- 3 and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). Interestingly, GAPDH has been recently proposed to act as an alternative transferrin receptor for iron acquisition through internalization of the GAPDH-transferrin complex into the early endosomes. FAC treatment also induced the up-regulation of oxidative stress-related proteins (PRDX), which was further confirmed at the metabolic level (increase in GSSG, 8 -isoprostane and pentose phosphate pathway intermediates) through mass spectrometry-based targeted metabolomics approaches.

40|$|A new {{screening}} technique using two-dimensional gels {{was developed}} in order to rapidly identify various elements in well-separated protein spots. Yeast mitochondrial proteins were separated using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (blue native/SDS 2 D-PAGE) and marked by silver staining. The 2 D gels were systematically analyzed by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) using a double-focusing sector field instrument. From more than 60 mitochondrial protein spots in two-dimensional gels, phosphorus, sulfur and selected metals (Cu, Zn and Fe) were detected in a short analysis time by screening 2 D gel with LA-ICP-MS using a focused laser beam. In selected protein spots a quantitative element determination was performed. Ion intensities of phosphorus and metals in single protein spots in the gels were measured at medium mass resolution using an optimized microanalytical method by LA-ICP-MS and in a solution of the gel (blank) after HNO 3 digestion by ICP-MS. For quantification purposes sulfur {{was used as the}} internal standard element. The detection limits for phosphorus, sulfur, copper, zinc and <b>iron</b> in protein <b>spots,</b> determined in the gel blank (Coomassie staining), were 0. 18 mug g(- 1), 1. 3 mg g(- 1), 6. 4 mug g(- 1), 17. 6 mug g(- 1) and 9. 5 mug g(- 1), respectively.

Having returned from Ireland, Happy Hogan resumes work at Stark Industries, and Tony Stark gets a letter from his cousin Morgan asking for help. What Tony doesn't realize is that his cousin Morgan is under the employ of Count Nefaria who is hoping to use Morgan in a plot to destroy Tony Stark, although Morgan would do it [...] "for free". First traveling to the States to pretend to seek Tony's help, Morgan is introduced to the Stark Industries staff and shown around the building. That night as Tony {{is on his way}} to a party, he happens to spy a rocket and decides to investigate it as Iron Man. Finding there's a bomb inside, Iron Man rushed back to Stark Industries and calls a bomb squad as Tony Stark. Arriving on the scene, they find the field empty. This whole episode is part of Morgan's plan, and Morgan (hiding in the bushes) uses a visio-projector to make Stark hallucinate and think he's seeing aliens. Using the device on Tony, Morgan begins to make everyone doubt Tony's sanity, and causes Senator Hamilton Byrd (a skeptic who accused Stark deliberately of being a Communist spy) to begin demanding that Stark be stripped of his defense contracts with the US army for fear that he may become a threat to national security. Believing that he is not insane, Stark returns to the original location where he started seeing aliens as Iron Man and begins scanning the area, unaware that Morgan has followed him there as well. Just before Morgan can blast Iron Man with the visio-projector, real aliens from the planet Froma arrive to investigate Earth.

40|$|Over the years, {{the use of}} PM {{machines}} {{has been}} increasing in the offshore wind industry and marine industry. The industries thrive on efficient function of the PM machines. These machines are prone to electro-mechanical faults due to environmental conditions and maintenance. Out of all these faults, stator internal faults are concerning as they can lead to insulation failures which may take around 30 seconds to expand and lead to a fire on ships, or on wind turbines. These type of faults develop gradually, which gives the opportunity to control the fault currents before they reach dangerous levels. Rolls Royce Marine AS is also working to tackle this problem for their hybrid propulsion shaft generator. DNVGL requires the generator to be made electrically dead during such event and the long-term propulsion should not be affected. During such conditions, WTs are either turned off or field weakening is used to develop a fault tolerant control (FTC) by the help of power electronics for the WT. FTC helps the machine not to be turned off completely, but less power is generated during fault conditions. An alternative efficient field weakening method using a Dual Rotor PMSM was suggested for both the applications. The DR-PMSM has two rotors instead of one, with identical surface mounted magnets on both rotors. One of these rotors {{has the capacity to}} rotate with respect to the other, {{in order to reduce the}} flux or completely short the flux path by misalignment of rotors. The machine stator is exactly like the conventional PMSM. The machine is capable of reducing the induced emf to zero by field weakening. In this thesis a transient 3 D finite element model is presented to test the credibility of the machine. A 2 D FEM of a conventional PMSM was also built to check the validity of the machine. It is seen that torque is a function of the active length of the machine, and if a gap is introduced between the rotors then the total length of the machine must be increased. Also, axial flux component which induces eddy currents in the stator teeth was studied. By modeling anisotropy in the stator <b>iron,</b> certain hot <b>spots</b> could be seen in the middle part of the stator. The forces that were in the shifting mechanism were studied and it was concluded that machine cogging can be reduced to reduce the effect of these forces. A machine prototype was also built which confirms the field weakening capability of the machine. The DR-PMSM works like a conventional PMSM but with flux weakening capabilities and can be implemented on marine and wind turbine applications for these type of fault conditions...|$|R
40|$|Metals with excitonic instabilities are {{multiband}} {{systems with}} significant electron-electron interaction. The electronic transport in such systems {{is affected by}} collective fluctuations of the electrons, leading to anomalous features in the measured transport coefficients. Many of these anomalies have not been well understood because the transport mechanisms in these systems tend to be rather complex. The complexity arises, on the one hand, from the multiband nature and, on the other, from the anisotropic scattering of electrons accompanied by emitting or absorbing collective fluctuations. Previous works considering scattering due to collective fluctuations have mainly focused on single-band systems, for example {{in the context of}} the normal-state transport in cuprates. The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in iron pnictides has renewed the interest in multiband systems. Exploring the transport mechanisms in multiband systems, I find some interesting new aspects, which do not occur in single-band systems. In particular, anisotropic scattering in a model with electronlike and holelike Fermi surfaces can lead to a negative conductivity contribution of the minority carriers, i. e., in an electric field, the minority carriers drift in the direction opposite of what one would expect based on their charge. I show that this effect can explain a reduced magnetoresistance in connection with an enhanced Hall coefficient, which has been measured in pnictides. Of particular interest are multiband models with hot spots on the Fermi surface, in part because of their relevance for the <b>iron</b> pnictides. Hot <b>spots</b> are states with enhanced scattering and therefore reduced excitation lifetimes. In single-band systems, the hot spots are found to have a much lower contribution to the total conductivity than other parts of the Fermi surface, which leads to the so-called hot-spot structure. I show that in the multiband case, the conductivity contributions are much more isotropic around the Fermi surface so that hot spots contribute to transport with a similar strength as other parts of the Fermi surface. I discuss this effect on the basis of an approximate analytical solution of the transport problem and numerically calculate the temperature dependence of several transport coefficients. It turns out that in the nematic phase of iron pnictides, the unexpectedly strong conductivity contribution of hot spots can explain the puzzling behavior of the resistive anisotropy. I show that the experimental observations can be explained within a scenario in which the anisotropy is mainly due to the broken symmetry of the spin-fluctuation spectrum in the nematic phase. In the spin-density-wave state, strongly anisotropic scattering can arise due to the propagating magnons. Using a two-band model relevant for iron pnictides, I find that this scattering can lead to an unusual interruption of the orbital motion of electrons in the magnetic field. As a consequence, the low-field magnetoresistance is linear with an alternating sign of the slope as a function of the direction of the current. In strong magnetic fields, the interrupted orbital motion makes the system unstable, which is characterized by a drop of the resistivity to zero...|$|R
40|$|In {{developing}} countries, {{iron deficiency}} (ID) {{and the related}} iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) affects about 50 % of children and woman and about 25 % of men. In total, an estimated two billion people is affected worldwide. In developing countries, a typical diet is based on cereals, legumes and vegetables and these contain many iron inhibitors like phytic acid and polyphenols. Iron fortification of maize meal, a staple food in South Africa {{is regarded as a}} cost effective, sustainable way to improve iron status in that country. The replacement of electrolytic iron with sodium iron (III) ethylenediaminetetraacetate (NaFeEDTA) (a more bioavailable source of iron) in the current multi-micronutrient fortificant premix added to maize meal as an iron fortificant compound has the potential to greatly enhance the efforts to improve the iron status of populations consuming high-phytate cereal-based diets. However, poor consumer acceptance, unacceptable taste and discolouration of iron fortified foods have been frequently listed as causes of unsuccessful iron fortification programmes. This study evaluated the effects of replacing electrolytic iron (35 mg iron/kg maize meal) in a multi-micronutrient fortificant premix with NaFeEDTA (at 15 and 30 mg iron/kg maize meal) added to special maize meal on the colour (L* a* b*) and sensory properties (appearance and flavour) of stiff porridges. The porridges were prepared using three different types of cooking vessels (stainless steel, cast iron and aluminium pots) and was evaluated fresh (within 30 minutes of preparation) and after 24 hour refrigerated storage (3 - 5 oC). The porridges were subjected to analytical sensory evaluation to test for difference or similarity and a consumer acceptance test (n = 80 consumers). Electrolytic iron significantly reduced L* and a* colour values in fortified maize meal when compared to maize meal fortified with the multi-micronutrient mix excluding iron. Elemental iron powders (e. g. electrolytic iron) being black or dark grey powders may have caused slight darkening of cereal flours. The <b>spot</b> <b>iron</b> test showed a uniform distribution of iron in maize meal with NaFeEDTA 15 (fortified with 15 mg iron/kg maize meal), NaFeEDTA 30 (fortified at 30 mg iron/kg maize meal) and electrolytic iron as well commercially fortified maize meals. Electrolytic iron or NaFeEDTA 15 and 30 maize meals resulted in stiff maize porridge prepared in aluminium, cast iron and stainless steel having lower L* values when compared to porridge prepared from maize meal fortified with the multi-micronutrient premix excluding iron. This could be attributed to interaction between polyphenols (ferulic and p-coumaric acid) found in maize meal and iron ions (Fe 2 +/Fe 3 +). This interaction has been suggested to induce structural changes and polymerisation in the polyphenols and thereby influencing their light absorption pattern and thus leading to darkening of maize porridges. Cast iron cookware showed significant differences (p < 0. 05) between iron treated porridges and control porridge (fortified with premix excluding iron) in both appearance and flavour while stainless steel showed significant differences (p < 0. 05) between iron treated porridges and control porridge only in flavour and aluminium cookware showed significant differences (p < 0. 05) between iron treated porridges and control porridge only in appearance. These differences could be attributed to the differences in thermal conductivity and heat transfer of the materials of the different cooking vessels and possible leaching of iron ions (Fe 3 +/Fe 2 +) from cast iron and stainless steel cookware and aluminium (Al 3 +) ions from aluminium cookware at different concentrations and/or rates during the cooking process. Appearance changes are probably due to the interaction between ion irons and polyphenols while flavour changes could be attributed to possible lipid oxidation of linoleic acid, a major polyunsaturated fatty acid found in maize meal. Iron ions (Fe 3 +/Fe 2 +) promotes lipid oxidation of linoleic acid leading to the development of hexanal, a major off-flavour compound in iron fortified maize meal porridge. Findings from this study indicate that a change from fortifying maize meal with electrolytic iron to NaFeEDTA will not lead to changes in appearance and flavour of maize porridge. However, an excess amount of NaFeEDTA (30 mg iron/kg maize meal) might lead to acceptability (taste) problems if porridge is prepared in cast iron cookware. Fortification of maize meal porridge with a more bioavailable source of iron (NaFeEDTA) may reduce the prevalence of iron deficiency in South Africa.
