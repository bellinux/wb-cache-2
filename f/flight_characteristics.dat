5|$|The {{design work}} was {{supported}} by a preceding research programme studying the <b>flight</b> <b>characteristics</b> of low ratio delta wings. A supersonic Fairey Delta 2 was modified to carry the ogee planform, and, renamed as the BAC 221, used for flight tests of the high speed flight envelope, the Handley Page HP.115 also provided valuable information on low speed performance.|$|E

The {{normally}} sesquiplane I-4s had {{the bottom}} wings removed (with no ill effect on <b>flight</b> <b>characteristics)</b> due to clearance problems with TB-1 propellers. First flight 3 December 1931. The TB-1 was piloted by A. I. Zalevskiy and A. R. Sharapov, the I-4s were piloted by V. P. Chkalov and A. F. Anisimov. Vakhmistrov himself flew in the front gunner's turret.|$|E
5|$|As the P.1127 {{had been}} {{developed}} {{at a time of}} deep UK defense cuts, Hawker had to seek commercial funding, and significant engine development funding came from the U.S. Research assistance was also provided by U.S.; including a series of wind tunnel tests conducted by NASA's Langley Research Center using sub-scale models, which demonstrated acceptable <b>flight</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Hawker test pilot Hugh Merewether went to the U.S. at NASA's request to fly the Bell X-14. In March 1959, the company's board of directors (Hawker Siddeley then) decided to privately fund two P.1127 prototypes.|$|E
40|$|T. M. 311 gave a short {{outline of}} modern {{theoretical}} aerodynamics {{as applied to}} light airplane design. This discussion may have been somewhat obscure to the nontechnical reader.

50|$|An {{autothrottle}} (automatic throttle) {{allows a}} pilot {{to control the}} power setting of an aircraft's engines by specifying a desired <b>flight</b> <b>characteristic,</b> rather than manually controlling the fuel flow. These systems can conserve fuel and extend engine life by metering the precise amount of fuel required to attain a specific target indicated air speed, or the assigned power for different phases of flight. A/T and AFDS (Auto Flight Director Systems) work together to fulfill the whole flight plan and greatly reduce the pilots' work load.|$|R
5000|$|No {{one knows}} for sure how the {{returning}} boomerang was invented, but some modern boomerang makers speculate that it developed from the flattened throwing stick, still used by the Australian Aborigines and other indigenous peoples around the world, including the Navajo in North America. A hunting boomerang is delicately balanced and much harder to make than a returning one. The curving <b>flight</b> <b>characteristic</b> of returning boomerangs was probably first noticed by early hunters trying to [...] "tune" [...] their throwing sticks to fly straight.|$|R
5|$|During {{the initial}} pilot {{conversion}} course, {{it became apparent}} that the AV-8B exhibited <b>flight</b> <b>characteristics</b> different from the AV-8A. These differences, as well as the digital cockpit fitted instead of the analog cockpit of the TAV-8A, necessitated additional pilot training. In 1984, funding for eight AV-8Bs was diverted {{to the development of a}} two-seat TAV-8B trainer. The first of the 28 TAV-8Bs eventually procured had its maiden flight on 21 October 1986. This aircraft was delivered to VMAT-203 on 24 July 1987; the TAV-8B was also ordered by Italy and Spain.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{deployment}} to Syria of several new Russian military systems, various countries had reportedly {{expressed interest in}} the Su-35. These countries included Algeria, Egypt, and Vietnam. According to Kommersant, the Algerian military had requested an Su-35 for testing in February 2016; the country was satisfied with the fighter's <b>flight</b> <b>characteristics</b> and so Moscow is waiting for a formal application. It is expected that the first phase {{will focus on the}} acquisition of at least twelve aircraft. Other countries that had also expressed interest in the aircraft include Kazakhstan, North Korea, and Pakistan, although a Russian official denied that the country was in talks with the latter about the Su-35.|$|E
5|$|In {{order for}} the Tornado to perform well as a {{low-level}} supersonic strike aircraft, it was considered necessary for it to possess good high-speed and low-speed <b>flight</b> <b>characteristics.</b> To achieve high-speed performance, a swept or delta wing is typically adopted, but these wing designs are inefficient at low speeds. To operate at both high and low speeds with great effectiveness, the Tornado uses a variable-sweep wing. This approach had been adopted by earlier aircraft, such as the American General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark strike fighter, and the Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 fighter. The F-111 has many similarities with the smaller Tornado; however, the Tornado differs in being a multi-role aircraft with more advanced onboard systems and avionics.|$|E
50|$|Males of O. meridionalis are {{remarkable}} {{in that they}} have an extremely small amount of wing area relative to its rather bulky body. In particular, the hindwings are very reduced and tetragonal in shape, tapering into a single pair of filamentous tails that are easily broken. The only other tailed Ornithoptera is Ornithoptera paradisea. Specimens of this sex are weak fliers and tend to spend most of the day resting. Females are more normally proportioned and have a <b>flight</b> <b>characteristic</b> more typical of the genus Ornithoptera. Both sexes have been recorded feeding at flowers in numbers early in the morning.|$|R

5|$|The Victor was {{commonly}} {{described as}} having good handling and excellent performance, along with favourable low speed <b>flight</b> <b>characteristics.</b> During the flight tests of the first prototype, the Victor proved its aerodynamic performance, flying up to Mach 0.98 without handling or buffeting problems; there were next to no aerodynamic changes between prototype and production aircraft. Production aircraft featured an automated nose-flap operation to counteract a tendency for the aircraft to pitch upwards during low-to-moderate Mach numbers. At low altitude, the Victor typically flew in a smooth and comfortable manner, {{in part due to}} its narrowness and flexibility of the crescent wing. One unusual flight characteristic of the early Victor was its self-landing capability; once lined up with the runway, the aircraft would naturally flare as the wing entered into ground effect while the tail continued to sink, giving a cushioned landing without any command or intervention by the pilot.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the athlete}} has taken <b>flight,</b> <b>characteristics</b> {{similar to that}} of a glider come into force. Ski flyers are able to cover such {{tremendous}} distances and land safely primarily due to the skis they use, which are substantially wider and longer than their cross-country or Alpine skiing counterparts. Each ski is first attached securely {{at the front of the}} boot, which has an exaggerated forward slant; the heel is then attached to a wedge on the ski using a hinged binding peg or strap with a maximum length of , allowing the athlete to lean forward into their preferred aerodynamic position and spread the skis wide apart. Much like aircraft wings, the skis are flexible to an extent, resulting in them bending and vibrating significantly upon takeoff. Maintaining stability in the air is paramount: a loss of balance, or a differential pressure under the skis, can lead to disaster (see list of ski flying accidents). A few athletes have a natural tendency to drift over to one side of the hill, invariably shortening their jump distance.|$|E
5|$|Some uses {{of heavy}} metals, {{including}} in sport, mechanical engineering, military ordnance, and nuclear science, {{take advantage of}} their relatively high densities. In underwater diving, lead is used as a ballast; in handicap horse racing each horse must carry a specified lead weight, based on factors including past performance, so as to equalize the chances of the various competitors. In golf, tungsten, brass, or copper inserts in fairway clubs and irons lower the centre of gravity of the club making it easier to get the ball into the air; and golf balls with tungsten cores are claimed to have better <b>flight</b> <b>characteristics.</b> In fly fishing, sinking fly lines have a PVC coating embedded with tungsten powder, so that they sink at the required rate. In track and field sport, steel balls used in the hammer throw and shot put events are filled with lead in order to attain the minimum weight required under international rules. Tungsten was used in hammer throw balls at least up to 1980; the minimum size of the ball was increased in 1981 to eliminate the need for what was, at that time, an expensive metal (triple the cost of other hammers) not generally available in all countries. Tungsten hammers were so dense that they penetrated too deeply into the turf.|$|E

5000|$|A harp trap is {{a device}} used to capture bats without exposing them to disentangling from traps like mist nets and hand nets. It capitalizes on bats' <b>flight</b> <b>characteristic</b> of turning {{perpendicular}} to the ground to pass between obstacles, {{in this case the}} trap's strings, in which flight attitude they cannot maintain their angle of flight and drop unharmed into a collection chamber. [...] Invented in 1958 by US Public Health Service veterinarian Denny Constantine, the harp trap has been modified for different applications and efficiencies by users, including Merlin Tuttle's double harp trap in 1974, Charles Francis' 4-frame harp trap in 1989, and other modifications improving collapsibility and portability.|$|R
5|$|The TSR-2 {{was to be}} {{powered by}} two Bristol-Siddeley Olympus reheated turbojets, {{advanced}} variants of those used in the Avro Vulcan. The Olympus would be further developed and would power the supersonic Concorde. The design featured a small shoulder-mounted delta wing with down-turned tips, an all-moving swept tailplane and a large all-moving fin. Blown flaps were fitted across the entire trailing edge of the wing to achieve the short takeoff and landing requirement, something that later designs would achieve with the technically more complex swing-wing approach. No ailerons were fitted, control in roll instead being implemented by differential movement of the slab tailplanes. The wing loading was high for its time, enabling the aircraft to fly at very high speed and low level with great stability without being constantly upset by thermals and other ground-related weather phenomena. The EE Chief Test Pilot, Wing Commander Roland Beamont, favourably compared the TSR-2's supersonic flying characteristics to the Canberra's own subsonic <b>flight</b> <b>characteristics,</b> stating that the Canberra was more troublesome.|$|E
5|$|The 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit (Special) {{constructed}} prototype {{atomic weapons}} (without nuclear material) and drop tested them. Little {{was known about}} the <b>flight</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the prototype atom bomb designs and how the fusing mechanism would work. In February 1945, a Flight Test Section was created within the 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit to carry out testing with prototype bombs {{in the shape of}} the Little Boy and Fat Man bombs. It was originally equipped with five Silverplate B-29s, three flight crews and five maintenance crews. To help out with an increasingly demanding schedule, four crews from the 393d Bombardment Squadron were made available. The Flight Test Section carried out 24 drop tests in June and 30 in July. About two thirds of the June tests were with Fat Man shapes and the rest with Little Boy ones. In July, all but four of the tests were with Fat Man shapes, some with explosive-filled Pumpkin bombs. Test drops were carried out at Wendover, at the Naval Ordnance Test Station at Inyokern, and at the Salton Sea Naval Auxiliary Air Station. Testing continued up to the last minute, with the Fat Man firing unit, known as the X-unit, only being successfully tested at Wendover on 4 August, and a final test of the X-unit was carried out six days later.|$|E

40|$|A unique {{feature of}} airdrop systems is the {{inherent}} and large variability in <b>flight</b> dynamic <b>characteristics.</b> The same physical article dropped {{on two different}} occasions will exhibit significantly different dynamic response. The problem only becomes worse for different test articles. Control systems for autonomous airdrop systems explicitly or implicitly assume knowledge of the <b>flight</b> dynamic <b>characteristics</b> in some way, shape, or form. A question facing autonomous airdrop designers is whether to use precomputed dynamic characteristics inside the control law, or to compute the needed <b>flight</b> dynamic <b>characteristics</b> in-flight and subsequently employ them in the control law. This paper establishes conditions when in-flight identified characteristics, {{with a focus on}} the turn rate dynamics, should be used, and when it is better to use precomputed results. It is shown that with expected levels of system variability, sensor noise, and atmospheric wind, in-flight identification generally produces significantly more accurate dynamic behavior of the lateral dynamics than a precomputed model of the nominal system, even when the in-flight identification is performed with highly inaccurate sensor data. The only exception to this rule observed in this work is the situation where atmospheric winds are high and a direct heading measurement is not available. In this situation, a precomputed estimate of the time constant of the lateral dynamics is more accurate than an in-flight estimate. These conclusions are reached though a comprehensive simulation study using a validated airdrop flight dynamic model applied to both a small and large parafoil...|$|R
