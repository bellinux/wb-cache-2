40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{relationships}} between insects and other organisms in the Late Jurasic to Middle Cretaceous ecosystems is {{documented in the}} f ossU record by generalized to highly host-specific vasailar plant and insect associations, and to a much lesser extent by plant-fungal-insect and tetrapod-insect associations. Vascular plant and insect associations are essentialy modem during this interval, and consist of external <b>foliage</b> <b>feeding,</b> leaf mining, galling, v^rood boring, piercing-and-sucking, sporivory and pollinivory, nectarivory, and pollination sjmdromes. Late Jurassic versions of all these interactions occurred on a diverse repertoire of major gymnospermous plant clades (angiosperms excepted) whereas {{by the end of}} the Middle Cretaceous most of these interactions had been transferred onto angiosperms either by descent from gymnospermous ancestors or by direct host transfer. Examples of these host-plant shifts include generalized external <b>foliage</b> <b>feeding,</b> probable host-specific leaf mining, galling, pollinivory, and nectarivory. While most of these associations did not persist to the present, there is evidence that relict, primitive insect lineages survived as intimate herbivores today on host-plant taxa with Late Jurasic to Middle Cretaceous ancestors, notably cycads and primitive dicotyledonous angiosperms...|$|E
40|$|Insect-protected soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) was {{developed}} to protect against <b>foliage</b> <b>feeding</b> by certain Lepidopteran insects. The assessment of potential consequences of transgene introgression from soybean to wild soybean (Glycine soja Seib. et Zucc.) is required as {{one aspect of the}} environmental risk assessment (ERA) in Japan. A potential hazard of insect-protected soybean may be hypothesized as transfer of a trait by gene flow to wild soybean and subsequent reduction in <b>foliage</b> <b>feeding</b> by Lepidopteran insects that result in increased weediness of wild soybean in Japan. To assess this potential hazard two studies were conducted. A three-year survey of wild soybean populations in Japan was conducted to establish basic information on foliage damage caused by different herbivores. When assessed across all populations and years within each prefecture, the total foliage from different herbivores was ≤ 30 %, with the lowest levels of defoliation (< 2 %) caused by Lepidopteran insects. A separate experiment using five levels of simulated defoliation (0 %, 10 %, 25 %, 50 % and 100 %) was conducted to assess the impact on pod and seed production and time to maturity of wild soybean. The results indicated that there was no decrease in wild soybean plants pod or seed number or time to maturity at defoliation rates up to 50 %. The results from these experiments indicate that wild soybean is not limited by lepidopteran feeding and has an ability to compensate for defoliation levels observed in nature. Therefore, the potential hazard to wild soybean from the importation of insect-protected soybean for food and feed into Japan is negligible...|$|E

Furthermore, accumulation of Mir 1 -CP in the vasculature suggests that Mir 1 -CP can potentially function as a phloemmobile protein. In a recent study, we provided evidence that Mir 1 -CP can curtail the growth of phloemsap sucking insect, corn leaf aphid (CLA; Rhopalosiphum maidis). Our current study further examined whether aboveground feeding by CLA can induce resistance to subsequent herbivory by belowground feeding western corn rootworm (WCR; Diabrotica virgifera virgifera).

Five large field trials at four altitudes in Tasmania, southern Australia, were established to measure performance of E. gunnii, E. globulus, their F 1 hybrids and E. nitens, the species currently used at higher altitudes. Four of these trials were browsed by brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula), allowing inheritance {{of resistance to}} browsing between cross-types to be determined. Inheritance in the F 1 hybrids {{was found to be}} additive, with partial dominance towards the less resistant E. gunnii, particularly at lower altitudes. E. nitens sustained similar damage levels to E. globulus. Field damage results were compared with relative intake of <b>foliage</b> in <b>feeding</b> trials using captive possums.

This means that E. nitens should generally remain the species of choice for forestry at high altitudes in southern Australia, particularly in areas where brushtail possum damage is not controlled.

40|$|ReportApple trees {{grown in}} the eastern United States are subject to attack by several insects and mites that feed on foliage. While injury caused by <b>foliage</b> <b>feeding</b> pests may vary due to the time and type of feeding, the {{principal}} mechanism of damage {{appears to be the}} reduction of photosynthesis by leaves. If individual pests affect the apple tree via reductions in leaf photosynthesis, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the influence of multiple pests is an additive reduction in leaf photosynthesis. Affirming the additive affect of multiple sources of pest injury would bolster current pest management practices. Spotted Tentiform Leafminer (STLM) (Phyllonorychter blancardella) is an important apple insect pest. Larvae burrow beneath the layers of apple leaves and consume the mesophyll creating mines where most of the green tissue has been removed. Unfortunately, {{little is known about the}} influence of damage by this insect on apple tree photosynthesis. Here, we present results from experiments designed to answer three questions: 1.

In this study, we evaluated one hypothesis for this difference: that the growth and fitness of native thistles are limited by natural enemies. Specifically, we tested the effect of insect <b>foliage</b> <b>feeding</b> on the survival and growth of large and small rosettes of tall thistle, Cirsium altissimum, using an insecticide exclusion experiment. Large juveniles were proportionally more damaged than were small ones. Insecticide reduced insect feeding, including overall intensity of plant damage and area removed or damaged {{on each of the}} two longest leaves, compared to controls treated only with water. As a result, both leaf growth and plant size increased significantly {{by the end of the}} growing season. Growth parameters showing major increases with the reduction in insect herbivory included upper rootcrown diameter, the total number of leaves, and the length of the two longest leaves on both large and small rosettes. Insecticide also reduced the mortality of large juveniles to half that of the controls. Thus, the study shows that the suite of naturally occurring, coevolved, foliage-feeding insects significantly reduces the growth and survival of rosettes of this native thistle under field conditions. The results provide strong support for the hypothesis underlying biological control of weeds programs...|$|E
40|$|During {{studies of}} the {{foraging}} ecology of birds in the western Goldfields of Western Australia in Spring 1997, 63 species were recorded. The majority were resident and insectivorous, but we estimate that about 25 % were migratory or nomadic. Our interpretation of the data is that migrants and nomads had aggregated {{in the area in}} response to an abundance of nectar and insects, following good rains in autumn and winter. In addition, there were seven species of raptors, possibly attracted by the numerous nectar-feeders. Ground-foragers dominated the avifauna, but many species foraged in the shrub and canopy layers by gleaning and snatching insects from the <b>foliage.</b> <b>Feeding</b> on flying insects was also prominent and accentuated by the availability of flying termites (Isoptera) at dusk. In contrast, bark was a poorly used foraging substrate compared with other woodlands that have been studied. Differences in community-wide foraging profiles can be explained by temporal and spatial variation in the kinds and abundance of prey (including nectar), but have important implications for the conservation of woodland bird communities.

40|$|Background: The Eocene, {{a time of}} {{fluctuating}} {{environmental change}} and biome evolution, was generally driven by exceptionally warm temperatures. The Messel (47. 8 Ma) and Eckfeld (44. 3 Ma) deposits offer {{a rare opportunity to}} take a census of two, deep-time ecosystems occurring during a greenhouse system. An understanding of the long-term consequences of extreme warming and cooling events during this interval, particularly on angiosperms and insects that dominate terrestrial biodiversity, can provide insights into the biotic consequences of current global climatic warming. Methodology/Principal Findings: We compare insect-feeding damage within two middle Eocene fossil floras, Messel and Eckfeld, in Germany. From these small lake deposits, we studied 16, 082 angiosperm leaves and scored each specimen for {{the presence or absence of}} 89 distinctive and diagnosable insect damage types (DTs), each of which was allocated to a major functional feeding group, including four varieties of external <b>foliage</b> <b>feeding,</b> piercing- and-sucking, leaf mining, galling, seed predation, and oviposition.

40|$|Most {{studies on}} plant–herbivore {{interactions}} focus on either root or shoot herbivory in isolation, but above- and belowground herbivores may interact on a shared host plant. Cotton (Gossypium spp.) produces gossypol {{and a variety}} of other gossypol-like terpenoids that exhibit toxicity to a wide range of herbivores and pathogens. Cotton plants also can emit herbivore-induced volatile compounds at the site of damage and systemically on all tissues above the site of damage. As these volatile compounds attract natural enemy species of the herbivore, they are thought to represent an indirect plant defense. Our study quantified gossypol and gossypol-like compounds in cotton plants with <b>foliage</b> <b>feeding</b> (Heliocoverpa zea), root feeding (Meloidogyne incognita), or their combination. Cotton plants with these treatments were studied also with respect to induced local and systemic volatile production and the attraction of the parasitic wasp Microplitis croceipes to those plants. We also evaluated whether foliage or root feeding affected foliar nitrogen levels in cotton. After 48 hr of leaf feeding and 5 wk of root feeding, local and systemic induction of volatiles (known to attract parasitoids such as M. croceipes) occurred with herbivore damage to leaves, and it increased in levels when root herbivory was added. Nevertheless, M. croceipes were equally attracted to plants with both leaf and root damage and leaf damage only. In contrast to previous studies in cotton, production of gossypol and gossypol-like compounds was not induced in leaf and root tissue following foliage or root herbivory, or their combination.

These host-plant and herbivore associations are mediated by seven functional feeding groups: a) external <b>foliage</b> <b>feeding,</b> b) piercing-and-sucking, c) boring (Phase 1 origins); d) galling, e) seed predation, f) nonfeeding oviposition (Phase 2 origins); and leaf mining (early Phase 3 origin).

Both the predation and oviposition rates were assessed in the laboratory to evaluate which mite species is potentially the most effective predator of E. americanus. In two greenhouse trials with non-flowering sweet pepper plants, we compared {{the efficacy of the}} predators E. gallicus and E. ovalis with A. swirskii and we assessed how this was affected by the application of cattail pollen. All stages of E. americanus, except adults, were consumed by all species of predatory mites.

Euseius gallicus displayed very low predation and oviposition rates compared to the other species of predatory mites. Cattail pollen did not support the population growth of poinsettia thrips, but it strongly increased the predatory mite population densities, particularly those of E. ovalis. Both A. swirskii and E. ovalis significantly reduced thrips densities on plants.

In a bioassay, S. exigua larvae were allowed to feed on either undamaged plants, or on plants that had previously been exposed to root herbivory, foliar herbivory, or a combination of both. Previous root herbivory reduced the relative growth rates as well as the food consumption of S. exigua by more than 50 % in comparison to larvae feeding on the undamaged controls. We found no effects in the opposite direction, as aboveground herbivory by S. exigua did not affect the relative growth rates of root-feeding A. lineatus. Remarkably, neither did the treatment with foliar herbivory affect the food consumption and relative growth rate of S. exigua in the bioassay. However, this treatment did result in a significant change in the distribution of S. exigua feeding. Plants that had been pre-exposed to foliar herbivory suffered significantly less damage on their young terminal leaves. While plant growth and foliar nitrogen levels were not affected by any of the treatments, we did find significant differences between treatments with respect to the level and distribution of plant defensive chemicals (terpenoids). Exposure to root herbivores resulted in an increase in terpenoid levels in both roots as well as in mature and immature foliage. Foliar damage, on the other hand, resulted in high terpenoid levels in young, terminal leaves only.

The great majority of the eggs of our smaller birds are so spotted or streaked with brown or black on variously tinted grounds that, when lying {{in the shadow of the}} nest and surrounded by the many colours and tints of bark and moss, of purple buds and tender green or yellow foliage, with all the complex glittering lights and mottled shades produced among these by the spring sunshine and by sparkling raindrops, they must have a quite different aspect from that which they possess when we observe them torn from their natural surroundings. We have here, probably, a similar case of general protective harmony to that of the green caterpillars with beautiful white or purple bands and spots, which, though gaudily conspicuous when seen alone, become practically invisible among the complex lights and shadows of the <b>foliage</b> they <b>feed</b> upon.|$|R
5000|$|On 10 January 1898, on a {{suggestion}} from Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen, approximately 50 residents founded the Aegidienberger Spar- und Darlehenskassenverein (Aegidienberg Savings and Loan Association). This cooperative {{made it possible}} to extend the water supply beginning in 1902, and from 1908 gave support to the Automobilgesellschaft (automobile association), whose aim was to create a bus connection with Bad Honnef and Königswinter. [...] On Whitsunday, 12 July 1905, a large fire in Orscheid, caused by children who were presumably playing, destroyed 13 buildings. In 1912 the first gymnastics club, Germania, was founded. When the First World War began in 1914, many men were called up for military service, including all the teachers. Many events were held to promote war bonds. The loan association lost reserves totalling 13,000 RM to the war bonds. The longer the war lasted, the more urgent was the need for raw materials. Children, especially, were required to collect these: paper, glass, tin foil, and also large quantities of <b>foliage</b> to <b>feed</b> the warhorses. Leaves were plucked from the trees and sent either fresh or dried to the collection point at Siegburg. They were dried in every possible place in homes. Copper fittings and every imaginable household object were requisitioned in numerous metal collections; even the church bells were melted down for the armaments industry.|$|R
