5|$|Once a field {{had been}} selected, an observing {{strategy}} {{had to be}} developed. An important decision was to determine which filters the observations would use; WFPC2 is equipped with forty-eight filters, including narrowband filters isolating particular emission lines of astrophysical interest, and broadband filters useful <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colours of stars and galaxies. The choice of filters {{to be used for}} the HDF depended on the 'throughput' of each filter—the total proportion of light that it allows through—and the spectral coverage available. Filters with bandpasses overlapping as little as possible were desirable.|$|E

5|$|Before King {{published}} {{the discovery of}} the fragment, she asked AnneMarie Luijendijk and fellow papyrologist Roger S. Bagnall of the Institute <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Study</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ancient World at New York University to review the fragment. They determined that it was likely authentic, both because of the skills which would have been required to forge the fragment, and because the papyrus seemed to have been in a collection for many years without having been announced. Luijendijk and Bagnall both doubted that the text was forged. Giovanni Maria Vian the editor of L'Osservatore Romano, the Vatican's official newspaper, dismissed the fragment as fake. In a television documentary about the fragment that was presented on the Smithsonian Channel in September 2012, Professor Alberto Camplani of Sapienza University of Rome suggested that he considered it more likely to be authentic.|$|E

5|$|Current Electoral College rules tend to {{decrease}} voter turnout in states without close races.
