5|$|Ithan Valley Park is a 19-acre {{park that}} is {{adjacent}} to the creek. It contains a hiking trail and has <b>fishing</b> <b>opportunities.</b> Radnor Valley Country Club is a golf course that borders the creek. Formerly crossing the creek, it was redesigned in 1968 to run north-south along the creek due to construction of Interstate 476.|$|E
5|$|Ithan Creek {{is within}} the Piedmont Uplands physiographic province. The creek was {{historically}} the site of several mills and {{has been subjected to}} numerous floods over the years. In 1902, a sewage company began dumping raw sewage into the creek, but this practice was stopped in 1905. The creek is in approved trout waters. It is the site of Ithan Valley Park, a small park with hiking and <b>fishing</b> <b>opportunities</b> and the Radnor Valley Country Club.|$|E
5|$|On {{the north}} side, the Midway High Lakes Area, which lies mostly outside the {{wilderness}} area, {{is one of}} the more popular areas around Mount Adams. The area is made up of four large lakes, Council Lake, Takhlakh Lake, Ollalie Lake, and Horseshoe Lake; one small lake, Green Mountain Lake; and a group of small lakes, Chain of Lakes. The area offers developed and primitive camping as well as a good number of trails for hiking and backpacking. Most trails are open to horses and many outside the wilderness are open to motorcycles. More scenery similar to what is encountered in the Mount Adams Wilderness abounds. The area also offers boating and <b>fishing</b> <b>opportunities</b> on several of the lakes.|$|E

5|$|Shoshone National Forest has {{virtually}} all the original animal and plant species that were there when white explorers such as John Colter and Jim Bridger first visited the region. The forest {{is home to the}} Grizzly bear, cougar, moose, tens of thousands of elk as well as the largest herd of bighorn sheep in the U.S. The streams in the forest are considered to have some of the best game species <b>fishing</b> <b>opportunities</b> in the U.S. including Yellowstone cutthroat trout. More than 1,300 miles of hiking trails, 32 campgrounds and adjacent forests and parklands provide numerous recreational opportunities. There are four wilderness areas within the forest, protecting {{more than half of the}} managed land area from development. From sagebrush plains through dense spruce and fir forest to craggy mountain peaks, Shoshone National Forest has a rich biodiversity rarely matched in any protected area.|$|E
5|$|Of the 28 {{fish species}} {{present in the}} forest, 11 are not native and have been {{introduced}} by humans. Rainbow trout, chinook salmon, westslope cutthroat trout, bull trout, and mountain whitefish are all native {{to some of the}} forest's waterways, while brook trout are a common invasive species that compete with the forest's salmonids. The forest's management indicator species is bull trout because they are sensitive to habitat changes and depend on specific habitat conditions. Sockeye salmon are native to the Salmon River watershed {{in the northern part of}} the forest, but dam construction on the Columbia and Snake rivers has hampered the migration of this anadromous fish and caused its population to collapse. Warm Lake supports the forest's only native population of Kokanee salmon, the resident (non-migratory) form of sockeye salmon. However, due to introductions by humans, Anderson Ranch, Arrowrock, Lucky Peak, and Deadwood reservoirs now support populations of Kokanee salmon. To provide additional recreational <b>fishing</b> <b>opportunities,</b> the Idaho Department of Fish and Game stocks several of the forest's waterways with rainbow trout, while reservoirs are also stocked with Kokanee or chinook salmon and Lake Cascade is stocked with coho salmon and steelhead, the anadromous form of rainbow trout.|$|E

40|$|Discards {{refer to}} that part of the catch {{returned}} to the sea during fishing operations. This study assesses the consequences, causes, and potential solutions to the discard problem using the example of North Sea fisheries. Fishermen's immediate objectives during fishing operations and the low confidence in projected gains from discard reduction measures have promoted use of unselective trawls while the poor enforcement of the quota system has exacerbated discard quantities. It is concluded that a reduction in discard rates is required for a long-term solution to the ecological and economic costs of discarding and the development of <b>fishing</b> <b>opportunity</b> incentives can promote the use of more selective fishing techniques.

40|$|A creel {{survey was}} {{conducted}} at the Keystone stilling basin to determine differences in pressure, harvest, and species composition between hydropower generation discharge and non-discharge periods. Pressure during discharge was 1. 7 times greater than during non-discharge. Total harvest during generation discharge was 1. 8 times that of non-discharge and was dominated by striped bass. Striped bass harvest rate was 3 times greater during discharge. During non-discharge, white bass, channel catfish, and blue catfish became important species in the harvest. No patterns of white or striped bass harvest were observed within generation discharge or non-discharge periods.

40|$|Sustainable {{management}} of fisheries is often compromised by management delaying implementation of regulations that reduce harvest, {{in order to}} maintain higher catches in the short term. Decreases or increases in fish population growth rate driven by environmental change, including ecosystem and climate change, affect the harvest that can be taken sustainably. If not acted on rapidly, environmental change could result in unsustainable <b>fishing</b> or missed <b>opportunity</b> for higher catches. Using simulation models of harvested fish populations influenced by environmental change, we explore how long fisheries managers can afford to wait before changing harvest regulations in response to changes in population growth. If environmental change causes population declines, delays greater than five years increase the probability of population collapse. Species with fast and highly variable population growth rates are more susceptible to collapse under delays and should be a priority for revised management where delays occur. Generally, the long-term cost of delay, in terms of lost <b>fishing</b> <b>opportunity,</b> exceeds the short-term benefits of overfishing. Lowering harvest limits and monitoring for environmental change can alleviate the impact of delays; however, these measures may be more costly than reducing delays. We recommend that management systems that allow rapid responses to population growth changes be enacted for fisheries management to adapt to ecosystem and climate change...|$|R
