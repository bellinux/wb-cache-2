5|$|Among insects, the stinger of {{the female}} honey bee is a {{modified}} ovipositor, homologous with ovipositors in other insects such as the Orthoptera, <b>Hemiptera,</b> and those Hymenoptera without stingers.|$|E
5|$|Insectes (Insects, inc. Myriapods): 1. Myriapodes, 2. Thysanoures (Thysanura), 3. Parasites, 4. Suceurs, 5. Coléoptères (Coleoptera), 6. Orthoptères (Orthoptera), 7. Hémiptères (<b>Hemiptera),</b> 8. Névroptères (Neuroptera), 9. Hyménoptères (Hymenoptera), 10. Lépidoptères (Lepidoptera), 11. Ripiptères (Strepsiptera), 12. Diptères (Diptera).|$|E
5|$|Thrips have {{asymmetrical}} mouthparts {{unique to}} the group. Unlike the <b>Hemiptera</b> (true bugs), the right mandible of thrips is reduced and vestigial – and in some species completely absent.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} {{swallows}}, both martins feed on flying insects, hunting in single-species groups or with other swallows and swifts. They feed low over {{a variety of}} open habitats or woodland. Prey items recorded for the Mascarene martin include scarab, click and other beetles, <b>Hemiptera</b> and flying ants, and Brazza's martins will take termites. In eastern Africa, areas deforested by logging or conversion to agriculture are used for hunting by Brazza's martins.|$|E
5|$|Bees {{beat their}} wings about 200 times a second. Their thorax muscles do not {{contract}} on each nerve firing, but rather vibrate like a plucked rubber band. This is efficient, since it lets the system consisting of muscle and wing operate at its resonant frequency, leading to low energy consumption. Further, it is necessary, since insect motor nerves generally cannot fire 200 times per second. These types of muscles are called asynchronous muscles and {{are found in}} the insect wing systems in families such as Hymenoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera, and <b>Hemiptera.</b> Bumblebees must warm up their bodies considerably to get airborne at low ambient temperatures. Bumblebees have been known to reach an internal thoracic temperature of 30°C (86°F) using this method.|$|E
5|$|During the Permian, the dragonflies Odonata {{were the}} {{dominant}} aerial predator and probably dominated terrestrial insect predation as well. True Odonata {{appeared in the}} Permian and all are amphibian. Their prototypes are the oldest winged fossils, {{go back to the}} Devonian, and are different from other wings in every way. Their prototypes may have had the beginnings of many modern attributes even by late Carboniferous and it is possible that they even captured small vertebrates, for some species had a wing span of 71cm. The earliest beetle-like species during the Permian had pointed, leather like forewings with cells and pits. <b>Hemiptera,</b> or true bugs had appeared in the form of Arctiniscytina and Paraknightia having forewings with unusual venation, possibly diverging from Blattoptera.|$|E
5|$|Entomopathogenic fungi, {{which cause}} disease in insects, {{include at least}} 14 species that attack aphids. Beauveria bassiana is mass-produced and used to manage {{a wide variety of}} insect pests {{including}} whiteflies, thrips, aphids and weevils. Lecanicillium spp. are deployed against white flies, thrips and aphids. Metarhizium spp. are used against pests including beetles, locusts and other grasshoppers, <b>Hemiptera,</b> and spider mites. Paecilomyces fumosoroseus is effective against white flies, thrips and aphids; Purpureocillium lilacinus is used against root-knot nematodes, and 89 Trichoderma species against certain plant pathogens. Trichoderma viride has been used against Dutch elm disease, and has shown some effect in suppressing silver leaf, a disease of stone fruits caused by the pathogenic fungus Chondrostereum purpureum.|$|E
5|$|In <b>Hemiptera</b> (true bugs), the {{forewings}} may be hardened, {{though to}} a lesser extent than in the beetles. For example, the anterior part of the front wings of stink bugs is hardened, while the posterior part is membranous. They are called hemelytron (pl. hemelytra). They are only found in the suborder Heteroptera; the wings of the Homoptera, such as the cicada, are typically entirely membranous. Both forewings and hindwings of Cicada are membranous, most species are glass-like although some are opaque. Cicadas are not good fliers and most fly only a few seconds. When flying, forewing and hindwing are hooked together by a grooved coupling along the hindwing costa and forewing margin. Most species have a basic venation as shown in the following picture.|$|E
5|$|Records {{of visits}} by pollinators exist {{for only a}} few species, but most of these suggest that the species are pollinated by insects. Flowers of A.chiribogensis produce small {{quantities}} of nectar, but lack a scent. Fruit flies (Drosophilidae), fungus gnats (Mycetophilidae, Sciaridae), midges (Cecidomyiidae, Ceratopogonidae) and micromoths (Lepidoptera) were recorded visiting these flowers, but bees and hover flies were not. Aiphanes eggersii was thought to be pollinated by bees and possibly by wind. Fruit flies (Drosophilidae), hover flies (Syrphidae), biting midges (Ceratopogonidae) and leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae) were recorded visiting the flowers of A.erinacea, but bees were not. Aiphanes horrida was reportedly pollinated by wind, bees (Meliponidae), weevils (Curculionidae) and bugs (<b>Hemiptera).</b> Flies and weevils were observed on the flowers of A.simplex.|$|E
5|$|Very low {{sounds are}} also {{produced}} in various species of Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Mantodea and Neuroptera. These low sounds are simply the sounds {{made by the}} insect's movement. Through microscopic stridulatory structures located on the insect's muscles and joints, the normal sounds of the insect moving are amplified {{and can be used}} to warn or communicate with other insects. Most sound-making insects also have tympanal organs that can perceive airborne sounds. Some species in <b>Hemiptera,</b> such as the corixids (water boatmen), are known to communicate via underwater sounds. Most insects are also able to sense vibrations transmitted through surfaces.|$|E
5|$|All {{species are}} predators and scavengers. Iridomyrmex ants tend to many <b>Hemiptera</b> insects and {{butterfly}} larvae to receive honeydew. Workers forage and scavenge for small insects, and they collect nectar from flowers and hunt for prey. Iridomyrmex ants normally forage on the ground, but most species will forage up into trees and vegetation {{to look for}} food. Most ants are diurnal foragers, but some are nocturnal. These nocturnal ants will sometimes become active during the day, but this depends on the suitability of the weather. They will also block their entrance holes when it is daytime; however, I. bigi is nocturnal and never comes out during the day. In a few species, a nest will not {{be placed in a}} shaded area; this is so it can warm up during the early mornings and workers can forage shortly after sunrise.|$|E
5|$|Ants of this genus are eurychoric; {{they have}} a {{widespread}} geographic distribution in many different climates, but they are usually found in dry and mesic habitats. They {{are referred to as}} a tropical genus, but the type specimen was collected from temperate Sydney. They are found in sclerophyll woodland and forests, eucalypt woodland, Casuarina forests, mallee, hillsides, beaches and urban areas. These ants are arboreal ants and nests are located in bark, logs, rotten wood, sand, soil, under rocks and stones, tree stumps and twigs or branches. In urban areas, colonies are found under cracked paths, inside house walls or in patio areas. Some species are considered pests, and they forage into pastures and houses where they show a preference for fluids and sweets. Ochetellus flavipes nesting habits are unique among Australian ants, and they construct small runways across the ground. These nests are structurally similar to nests built by some Polyrhachis ants, which construct platforms woven from plants that house the <b>Hemiptera</b> insects they attend to.|$|E
5|$|In rural Australia, meat ants are {{important}} to farmers as they place animal carcasses on their nests. In a matter of weeks, the entire carcass will be consumed and reduced to bones. However, Iridomyrmex ants are sometimes considered pests, due to these ants entering human houses to feed on food and soil disturbance. Eradication of nests can be difficult, as nests can be repopulated from a rival colony or adjoining nests which were not affected. Particular species have adapted rather well to urbanisation; during the early days in Canberra, newly constructed suburbs provided new nest sites for meat ants, and populations flourished. Other factors include plantations enriched with valuable food sources and home gardens. Workers also cause problems {{for those who are}} Citrus producers; they will affect the biological control of <b>Hemiptera</b> insects, specifically those who produce honeydew.|$|E
5|$|Triaenops menamena mainly {{occurs in}} the dry regions of western Madagascar, but has also been {{recorded}} in humid areas in the far southeast and northeast, and is found up to 1300m (4300ft) above sea level. It mainly occurs in forests, but has also been recorded outside forest and is not dependent on it. An obligate cave dweller, it is known to roost in large colonies, with one cave colony estimated to contain over 40,000 bats; this cave also contained an estimated 10,000 Paratriaenops furculus. The effective population size of the species {{is estimated to be}} about 121,000. Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) form the main component of its diet, but it also eats Coleoptera (beetles) and <b>Hemiptera</b> (bugs) and fewer members of some other insect orders. It is unclear how the ecological niches of Triaenops and the less frequently captured Paratriaenops furculus are separated, as both eat lepidopterans and occur in the same regions.|$|E
5|$|The {{black bean}} aphid (Aphis fabae) {{is a small}} black insect in the Aphis genus, with a broad, soft body, {{a member of the}} order <b>Hemiptera.</b> Other common names include blackfly, bean aphid and beet leaf aphid. In the warmer months of the year it is found in large numbers on the undersides of leaves and on the growing tips of host plants, {{including}} various agricultural crops and many wild and ornamental plants. Both winged and wingless forms exist and at this time of year, they are all females. They suck sap from stems and leaves and cause distortion of the shoots, stunted plants, reduced yield and spoiled crops. This aphid also acts as a vector for viruses that cause plant disease and the honeydew it secretes may encourage the growth of sooty mould. It breeds profusely by live birth but its numbers are kept in check, especially in the later part of the summer, by various predatory and parasitic insects. Ants feed on the honeydew it produces and take active steps to remove the aphid's enemies. It is a widely distributed pest of agricultural crops and can be controlled by chemical or biological means. In the autumn, winged forms move to different host plants where both males and females are produced. These mate and the females lay eggs which overwinter.|$|E

25|$|Tessaratomidae is {{classified}} under order <b>Hemiptera</b> (true bugs), suborder Heteroptera, infraorder Pentatomomorpha, and superfamily Pentatomoidea (shield bugs and stink bugs).

25|$|Other {{forms of}} human trypanosomiasis also exist {{but are not}} {{transmitted}} by tsetse. The most notable is American trypanosomiasis, known as Chagas disease, which occurs in South America, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, and transmitted by certain insects of the Reduviidae, members of the <b>Hemiptera.</b>|$|E
25|$|Consumed plant {{material}} includes fruit (either fallen {{or on the}} tree), seeds, green shoots, tender leavers, buds, flowers, tender stems, roots, and tubers. Much of the animal food consists of insects, including ants, termites, beetles, grasshoppers, <b>hemiptera,</b> and lepidopteran larvae, as well as gastropods, mollusks, worms, and small vertebrates, such as amphibians and reptiles. Larger species will eat small mammals.|$|E
25|$|In 2000 {{the insect}} {{collection}} {{was the largest}} collection at MZUSP, with over 4.8million specimens preserved dry (pinned) or in ethanol. The collection is an aggregation of smaller collections focused on individual insect orders, such as Coleoptera (beetles), Diptera (true flies), <b>Hemiptera</b> (true bugs), Hymenoptera (sawflies, wasps, bees and ants), Isoptera (termites) and Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies). Each collection is curated independently.|$|E
25|$|Aphids passively feed on sap of phloem {{vessels in}} plants, {{as do many}} of their fellow members of <b>Hemiptera</b> such as scale insects and cicadas. Once a phloem vessel is punctured, the sap, which is under pressure, is forced into the aphid's food canal. Occasionally, aphids also ingest xylem sap, which is a more dilute diet than phloem sap as the {{concentrations}} of sugars and amino acids are 1% {{of those in the}} phloem. Xylem sap is under negative hydrostatic pressure and requires active sucking, suggesting an important role in aphid physiology. As xylem sap ingestion has been observed following a dehydration period, aphids are thought to consume xylem sap to replenish their water balance; the consumption of the dilute sap of xylem permitting aphids to rehydrate. However, recent data showed aphids consume more xylem sap than expected and they notably do so when they are not dehydrated and when their fecundity decreases. This suggests aphids, and potentially, all the phloem-sap feeding species of the order <b>Hemiptera,</b> consume xylem sap for another reason than replenishing water balance.|$|E
25|$|Scutellerids {{were first}} {{described}} by the English zoologist William Elford Leach in 1815. It belongs to the order <b>Hemiptera</b> (true bugs), under the suborder Heteroptera and infraorder Pentatomomorpha. They are classified under the superfamily Pentatomoidea. They were formerly classified as a subfamily of Pentatomidae by George Willis Kirkaldy in 1909. The earliest attempt to restore them to family status was in 1917 by Edward Payson Van Duzee. Most authorities today regard it as a valid family group.|$|E
25|$|Social living {{provides}} {{a multitude of}} advantages to its practitioners, including predation risk reduction, environmental buffering, food procurement, and possible mating advantages. The most advanced form of sociality is eusociality, characterized by overlapping generations, cooperative care of the young, and reproductive division of labor, which includes sterility or near-sterility of {{the overwhelming majority of}} colony members. With few exceptions, all the practitioners of eusociality are insects of the orders Hymenoptera (ants, bees, and wasps), Isoptera (termites), Thysanoptera (thrips), and <b>Hemiptera</b> (aphids).|$|E
25|$|Other insect {{groups on}} the site are less well surveyed, but several rare species have been recorded, {{including}} for six species of weevil (Curculionoidea), eight species of plant bugs (<b>Hemiptera),</b> and two species of chrysomelid beetle, Aphthona herbigrada and Mantura matthewsii; both of which feed on the rock rose (Helianthemum). Day-flying moths recorded include for the wood tiger (Parasemia plantaginis), and the rare forester moth (Jordanita globulariae). Small mammals such as rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and badgers (Meles meles) are common to the site and the surrounding area.|$|E
25|$|After {{considering}} the various suspected agents, Portaels et al. proposed {{the hypothesis that}} human beings, as well as domestic and wild animals, could be contaminated or infected by biting insects such as water bugs. Aquatic bugs are cosmopolite insects found throughout temperate and tropical regions especially rich in freshwater. They represent about 10% of all species of <b>Hemiptera</b> associated with water and belong to two series of the suborder Heteroptera: the Nepomorpha, which include four superfamilies whose members {{spend most of their}} time under water, and the Naucoridae, which include a single family, the Naucoridae, whose members are commonly termed creeping water bugs.|$|E
25|$|All known fairyflies are parasitoids of eggs {{of other}} insects. These eggs are {{commonly}} laid in concealed locations, {{such as in}} plant tissues or underground. They {{do not seem to}} be species-specific when it comes to choosing hosts. Some species are known to parasitize insects from several families of a single order. Their most common hosts are insects belonging to the order <b>Hemiptera</b> (true bugs), especially Auchenorrhyncha (leafhoppers, cicadas, and allies) and Coccoidea (scale insects), but this might be because these groups are simply better studied. Other important host orders include Coleoptera (beetles), Diptera (true flies), Odonata (dragonflies and allies), Psocoptera (booklice and allies), and Thysanoptera (thrips). Hosts are known definitely for only a quarter of all known genera.|$|E
25|$|During a {{study of}} the bat's diet, {{examination}} of droppings showed that it can also gather prey items from the ground. The diet was found mostly to consist of large Diptera (flies) but Trichoptera (caddisfly), Hymenoptera (bees, wasps, ants and hoverflies) and Arachnida (spiders and harvestmen) were also commonly eaten. The remains of other prey items occasionally found in the droppings included Lepidoptera (moths), Coleoptera (beetles), <b>Hemiptera</b> (bugs), Dermaptera (earwigs) and Chilopoda (centipedes). This bat may use its interfemoral membrane to catch prey and the fringing hairs may have a sensory function. It has been shown that it can land on the ground to pick up and pursue invertebrates that are active at night, and continues to emit search signals in order to locate them precisely.|$|E
25|$|Of the {{estimated}} 200,000 animal species in Australia, about 96% are invertebrates. While {{the full extent}} of invertebrate diversity is uncertain, 90% of insects and molluscs are considered endemic. Invertebrates occupy many ecological niches and are important in all ecosystems as decomposers, pollinators, and food sources. The largest group of invertebrates is the insects, comprising 75% of Australia's known species of animals. The most diverse insect orders are the Coleoptera, with 28,200 species of beetles and weevils, the Lepidoptera with 20,816 species including butterflies and moths, and around 14,800 species of Hymenoptera, including the ants, bees and wasps. Order Diptera, which includes the flies and mosquitoes,comprises 7,786 species. Order <b>Hemiptera,</b> including bugs, aphids and hoppers, comprises 5,650 species; and there are 2,827 species of order Orthoptera, including grasshoppers, crickets and katydids. Introduced species that pose a significant threat to native species include the European wasp, the red fire ant, the yellow crazy ant and feral honeybees which compete with native bees.|$|E
25|$|For {{the most}} part the femur and tibia are the longest leg {{segments}} but variations in the lengths and robustness of each segment relate to their functions. For example, gressorial and cursorial, or walking and running type insects respectively, usually have well-developed femora and tibiae on all legs, whereas jumping (saltatorial) insects such as grasshoppers have disproportionately developed metafemora and metatibiae. In aquatic beetles (Coleoptera) and bugs (<b>Hemiptera),</b> the tibiae and/or tarsi of one or more pairs of legs usually are modified for swimming (natatorial) with fringes of long, slender hairs. Many ground-dwelling insects, such as mole crickets (Orthoptera: Gryllotalpidae), nymphal cicadas (Hemiptera: Cicadidae), and scarab beetles (Scarabaeidae), have the tibiae of the forelegs (protibiae) enlarged and modified for digging (fossorial), whereas the forelegs of some predatory insects, such as mantispid lacewings (Neuroptera) and mantids (Mantodea), are specialized for seizing prey, or raptorial. The tibia and basal tarsomere of each hindleg of honey bees are modified for the collection and carriage of pollen.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{completion}} of feeding, the mosquito will withdraw her proboscis, {{and as the}} gut fills up, the stomach lining secretes a peritrophic membrane that surrounds the blood. This membrane keeps the blood separate from {{anything else in the}} stomach. However, like certain other insects that survive on dilute, purely liquid diets, notably many of the <b>Hemiptera,</b> many adult mosquitoes must excrete unwanted aqueous fractions even as they feed. (See the photograph of a feeding Anopheles stephensi: Note that the excreted droplet patently is not whole blood, being far more dilute). As long as they are not disturbed, this permits mosquitoes to continue feeding until they have accumulated a full meal of nutrient solids. As a result, a mosquito replete with blood can continue to absorb sugar, even as the blood meal is slowly digested {{over a period of several}} days. Once blood is in the stomach, the midgut of the female synthesizes proteolytic enzymes that hydrolyze the blood proteins into free amino acids. These are used as building blocks for the synthesis of egg yolk proteins.|$|E
25|$|Chrysoperla carnea adults eat pollen and {{honeydew}} {{and are not}} predatory, but {{the larvae}} have been recorded as feeding on seventy different prey species in five insect orders. The prey are mostly from the order <b>Hemiptera</b> and are predominantly aphids on low growing vegetation. On crops, the larvae have been reported as attacking several species of aphids, red spider mites, thrips, whitefly, the eggs of leafhoppers, leaf miners, psyllids, small moths and caterpillars, beetle larvae and the tobacco budworm. They {{are considered to be}} important predators of the long-tailed mealybug under glass. C. carnea occurs naturally in many growing regions of the northern hemisphere. It is considered an important aphid predator in cotton crops in Russia and Egypt, sugar beet in Germany and vineyards in Europe. It {{has been found to be}} effective at controlling the cotton whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, in cotton crops in Pakistan. The presence of the larvae on the foliage was found to inhibit visitation and oviposition by B. tabaci which suggests the larvae may produce a volatile semiochemical which repels the whitefly.|$|E
25|$|Seed {{predation}} often {{occurs at}} contrasting plant ontogenic stages. Predispersal seed predation takes place when seeds {{are removed from}} the parent plant before dispersal, {{and it has been}} most often reported in invertebrates, birds, and in granivorous rodents that clip fruits directly from trees and herbaceous plants. Postdispersal seed predation arises once seeds have been released from the parent plant. Birds, rodents, and ants are known to be among the most pervasive postdispersal seed predators. Furthermore, postdispersal seed predation can take place at two contrasting stages: predation on the ‘‘seed rain’’ and predation on the ‘‘seed bank’’. Whereas predation on the seed rain occurs when animals prey on released seeds usually flush with the ground surface, predation on the seed bank takes place after seeds have been incorporated deeply into the soil. Both pre- and post-dispersal seed predation are extremely frequent in nature. However, fundamental differences occur between the two. Pre-dispersal predators are most often specialists, as {{they are more likely to}} adapt to clustered resources. Predator specialization requires that these animals utilize specific cues like plant chemistry (volatile compounds), color and size to attack seeds. In addition, specialization requires that the life cycle of the predator match the production of seeds by the host plant. Therefore, animals with shorter life span, like insects, are more common pre-dispersal predators. Common insect groups of pre-dispersal predators are Coleoptera, <b>Hemiptera,</b> Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera. For this reason, a greater diversity of predators feed on seeds prior to dispersal. Nevertheless, there are important vertebrate pre-dispersal predators, especially birds and small mammals.|$|E
