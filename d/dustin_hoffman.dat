5000|$|Similarly, LaMarche {{points to}} two {{other types of}} movies {{difficult}} to market to large audiences. [...] "Winter can {{be a boon to}} little movies with niche audiences," [...] she writes, pointing to <b>Dustin</b> <b>Hoffmans</b> directorial debut, Quartet, which received a limited U.S. release in January 2013, and Struck by Lightning, released at the same time. Movies that also blend genres or defy such categorization, such as the zombie-human Romeo and Juliet retelling, Warm Bodies, or the limited-release Charlie Sheen comedy A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III, are also ideal for their dump-months release time frame.|$|R
5000|$|Rather {{than being}} an asylum escapee, as {{portrayed in the}} Tick comic book series, the {{animated}} version of The Tick crashes a superhero convention to win the [...] "protectorship" [...] of The City.

Its title character was voiced by Townsend Coleman and his sidekick, Arthur, by Micky Dolenz for Season 1. Rob Paulsen took over the latter role for Seasons 2 and 3. The series also features Die Fledermaus as a shallow, self-absorbed Batman parody; Sewer Urchin, an Aquaman parody who resembles <b>Dustin</b> <b>Hoffmans</b> character in Rain Man; and American Maid, a more noble superheroine featuring aspects of Wonder Woman and Captain America.|$|R

5|$|The film's {{official}} debut was in Toronto on 7 September 2006, at the Ryerson University Theatre {{during the}} Toronto International Film Festival.

5|$|Abebe {{has been}} {{featured}} in several documentaries about his life and the Olympics in general. His victory at the 1964 Olympics was featured in the 1965 documentary, Tokyo Olympiad directed by Kon Ichikawa. Footage from that film was recycled in the 1976 thriller, Marathon Man directed by John Schlesinger and starring <b>Dustin</b> <b>Hoffman.</b> Abebe {{was the subject of}} Bud Greenspan's 1972 documentary, The Ethiopians.

5000|$|Skits in the MTV series {{included}} [...] "The Eddie Munster Comeback Special," [...] where Ben {{plays an}} all-grown-up and angry Eddie Munster, complete with who {{gets into a}} shouting match with Grandpa from The Munsters (played by Al Lewis) while trying to stage a serious moment from John Steinbecks Of Mice and Men. In somewhat of a foreshadowing of his subsequent series, one episode was dedicated to showing the FOX network that Ben and Jeff could play all {{the characters in the}} 1990 Fox primetime lineup, spoofing COPS, Alien Nation, Booker, and Married... with Children. [...] "The Star Trek Show" [...] spoofed William Shatner and Bono and the inevitable demise of the red-shirted security officers beamed down to an alien planet, portrayed by Ben and Jeffs characters [...] "Howie and Jordo," [...] two college-age underachievers who were constantly in trouble. Through multiple layers of sub-referencing, Howie and Jordo jump through a time portal and end up at Woodstock and sing the [...] "Time Portal Blues", while still wearing their Star Trek uniforms. Another multi-layered Star Trek reference is made in an episode where Stiller runs through multiple episodes of satire, playing Al Pacino in Dog Day Afternoon, but having hijacked The Enterprise, speaking through Uhura with Leon (played by Jeff Kahn) who is his boyfriend who needs an alien change operation. He does the same kind of stunt playing Captain Kirk in the character of Tom Cruise in Rain Man with Kahn playing <b>Dustin</b> <b>Hoffmans</b> savant character in the makeup and dialogue of Mr. Spock. Stiller and Kahn were constantly sub-referencing into thicker layers of characterizations.|$|R

5|$|Casting {{the film}} proved troublesome, {{particularly}} for the lead role of Deckard. Screenwriter Hampton Fancher envisioned Robert Mitchum as Deckard and wrote the character's dialogue with Mitchum in mind. Director Ridley Scott and the film's producers spent months meeting and discussing the role with <b>Dustin</b> <b>Hoffman,</b> who eventually departed over differences in vision. Harrison Ford was ultimately chosen for several reasons, including his performance in the Star Wars films, Ford's interest in the Blade Runner story, and discussions with Steven Spielberg who was finishing Raiders of the Lost Ark {{at the time and}} strongly praised Ford's work in the film. Following his success in films like Star Wars (1977) and Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Ford was looking for a role with dramatic depth. According to production documents, several actors were considered for the role, including Gene Hackman, Sean Connery, Jack Nicholson, Paul Newman, Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Al Pacino, and Burt Reynolds.|$|E

About to be burned for heresy, Joan is distraught {{that she will be}} executed without making a final confession. The Bishop tells her she must recant her visions before he can hear her confession. Joan signs the recantation. The relieved Bishop shows the paper to the English, saying that Joan can no longer be burned as a heretic. Whilst in her cell, Joan is confronted by an unnamed cloaked man (<b>Dustin</b> <b>Hoffman),</b> who is implied to be Joan's conscience. The man makes Joan question whether she was actually receiving messages from God.|$|E
5|$|Ilya Salkind {{had first}} {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} a Superman film in late 1973. In November 1974, after a long, difficult process with DC Comics, the Superman film rights were purchased by Ilya, his father Alexander Salkind, and their partner Pierre Spengler. DC wanted a list of actors that were to be considered for Superman, and approved the producer's choices of Muhammad Ali, Al Pacino, James Caan, Steve McQueen, Clint Eastwood and <b>Dustin</b> <b>Hoffman.</b> The filmmakers felt it was best to film Superman and Superman II back-to-back, simultaneously, and to make a negative pickup deal with Warner Bros. William Goldman was approached to write the screenplay, while Leigh Brackett was considered. Ilya hired Alfred Bester, who began writing a film treatment. Alexander felt, however, that Bester was not famous enough, so he hired Mario Puzo (The Godfather) to write the screenplay at a $600,000 salary. Francis Ford Coppola, William Friedkin, Richard Lester, Peter Yates, John Guillermin, Ronald Neame and Sam Peckinpah were in negotiations to direct. Peckinpah dropped out when he produced a gun during a meeting with Ilya. George Lucas turned down the offer because of his commitment to Star Wars.|$|E
