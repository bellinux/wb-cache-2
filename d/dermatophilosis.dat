25|$|Blowfly strike, or flystrike is {{a serious}} welfare problem in the animal industry. This {{cutaneous}} myiasis or infestation not only causes severe discomfort or stress to the animal, but will also cause death when left untreated. Ewe lambs and female sheep are primarily affected and are struck predominately in the rear quadrant of the animal due to fecal staining. Due to the difficulty in controlling these flies, there are considerable losses in the sheep industry every year. Also, there is an increasing concern of the insecticidal use and the surgical procedures done to control L. cuprina, making this not only an animal welfare issue but also an economical one. The maggots of L. cuprina rapidly grow while eating the living flesh of the sheep while secreting ammonia, thus, poisoning the sheep. Sheep show signs of skin irritation by rubbing and biting the affected areas {{during the first few}} days after the eggs have been laid. This causes an inflammatory response in the sheep resulting in severe irritation and pyrexia. Once a flystrike has started other flies are attracted to the site. Although treatment is available, the delayed response time due to symptoms allows wool breakage in the affected area and fleece to be tender overall. There are many predispositions to the flystrike that make a host more favorable, including an infection with <b>dermatophilosis</b> and footrot, both of which can be treated and prevented. In some animals a weak resistance can develop, but this immune response is often associated with a decrease in productivity which is an undesirable trait.|$|E

50|$|Dermatophilus congolensis is a gram {{positive}} bacterium and is {{the cause}} of a disease called <b>dermatophilosis</b> (sometimes called mud fever) in animals and humans, a dermatologic condition that manifests itself with the formation of crusty scabs that contain the microorganism. Some people erroneously call it mycotic dermatitis. Rainscald is another condition often seen in animals, which is also caused by Dermatophilus congolensis bacteria.|$|E
50|$|These are numerous; typical {{examples}} follow. Because ticks feed {{repeatedly and}} only on blood, and have long lives, they are suitable hosts for {{many types of}} microbes. The microbes exploit the ticks for transmission between one domestic animal and another. Ticks are thus known as vectors (transmitters) of microbes. If the microbes cause pathological changes, they are known as pathogens. Most of these parasitic relationships are highly developed with a strict biological relationship between the microbe and the tick’s gut and salivary glands. However, some microbes, such as Anaplasma marginale and A. centrale, can also be transmitted by biting flies, or by blood on injection needles (iatrogenic transmission). A characteristic of diseases caused by tick-transmitted microbes is the epidemiological state of endemic stability that commonly develops in herds or flocks of livestock. This stability is due {{to high levels of}} immunity to the microbes developing as a result of survival through early infection from infected ticks. The ticks are often constantly present and long-lived. Acquisition of immunity may be aided by the protection of antibodies in the mother’s colostrum (first milk). Some microbes causing diseases associated with ticks are not transmitted by the ticks. For example, the skin disease <b>dermatophilosis</b> of cattle, sheep, and goats is caused by the bacterium Dermatophilus congolensis, which is transmitted by simple contagion. But when Amblyomma variegatum adult ticks are also feeding and causing a systemic suppression of immunity in the host, then <b>dermatophilosis</b> becomes severe or even fatal.|$|E
5000|$|Rainscald (also {{known as}} <b>dermatophilosis,</b> rain rot and streptothricosis) {{is a common}} skin disease in horses that {{is caused by the}} {{bacterium}} Dermatophilus congolensis. [...] This is the same organism that causes Mud fever in horses. This disease is very common in cows, sheep and goats and is also found occasionally in cats, dogs, and humans. D. congolensis is a gram-positive bacterium that is thought to originate from the soil. It commonly causes disease in moist tropical areas, but can also be found in wet northern environments. [...] Moisture and high temperatures facilitate the dispersal and penetration of zoospores into the skin, contributing to the spread of the disease. Ticks, biting flies, and contact with other infected animals also causes the spread of rainscald. Once in the skin, the bacteria cause inflammation of the skin as well as the typical symptoms associated with rainscald.|$|E

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{study was conducted}} to assess cattle owners’ awareness, perceptions, attitudes and drug-usage practices with regard to bovine <b>dermatophilosis.</b> Knowledge of these farmers’ attributes is important for animal health policy makers in their endeavours to provide optimum disease control strategies that are acceptable to the communities. Data on cattle owner awareness of bovine <b>dermatophilosis,</b> causes, treatment practices, perceptions about its importance and potential dangers to humans were collected using an intervieweradministered questionnaire. A total of 185 stockowners and cattle herds were involved in the study, with bovine <b>dermatophilosis</b> determined clinically by veterinarians. The results showed that 45. 4 % of the herds were clinically positive for <b>dermatophilosis,</b> and most farmers (79. 5 %) were generally aware that <b>dermatophilosis</b> was a cattle disease. In the event of a <b>dermatophilosis</b> outbreak in a herd, 74. 1 % of the farmers treated their cattle using antibiotics; the proportion of farmers treating cattle did not differ (p > 0. 05) across the diptanks. Fifty-two farmers (52 / 63) indicated that drugs had to be administered four to seven times before an animal recovered from infection. Tetracyclines were the antibiotics used by most farmers (79. 3 %) to treat <b>dermatophilosis,</b> with 19. 1 % using penicillins. Concerns were raised by farmers about the effectiveness of these drugs against bovine <b>dermatophilosis.</b> Across the study sites, 48. 6 % and 27. 6 % of the farmers perceived bovine <b>dermatophilosis</b> to be an important disease at the herd and area level, respectively. A small proportion (12. 4 %) of the farmers regarded bovine <b>dermatophilosis</b> as a potentially zoonotic disease. The high level of stockowners’ general awareness, with regards to bovine <b>dermatophilosis,</b> sets ideal conditions for the mobilisation of farmers by animal health authorities in the control of the disease. However, further research needs to be undertaken to investigate effective antibiotic delivery protocols and the potential zoonotic impact of bovine <b>dermatophilosis</b> in a situation of high disease prevalence...|$|E
40|$|The {{association}} of fleece characters with susceptibility to <b>dermatophilosis</b> was studied in two flocks {{located on the}} south coast of Western Australia. The characters examined were wax content, suint content, wax to suint ratio, suint pH, yield, fleece wettability, fibre diameter, coefficient of fibre diameter variation, suint direct extract, direct extract pH and electrical conductivity. The results showed that wax to suint ratio was the only fleece character significantly (P < 0. 05) different in both flocks for sheep with <b>dermatophilosis</b> as compared to sheep without <b>dermatophilosis</b> (flock 1 : 2. 0 v 2. 7; flock 2 : 1. 4 v 1. 8). These differences were markedly influenced by the wax content (13. 5 v 16. 6 %, P < 0. 01) in flock 1 and the suint content (9. 7 v 8. 18, < 0. 05) in flock 2. Both the electrical conductivity (1. 30 v 0. 91 siemens/cm, P < 0. 01) and suint content of the direct extract (8. 2 v 6. 4 %, P < 0. 05) were significantly greater in sheep with <b>dermatophilosis</b> than in sheep without <b>dermatophilosis</b> for flock 1.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{document}} the ethno-veterinary plants and non-plant remedies that farmers used to control <b>dermatophilosis</b> and ticks, and validate these in vitro and in vivo, as well as determine how the interface of Amblyomma variegatum and A. hebraeum affected the epidemiology of bovine <b>dermatophilosis</b> at selected small-holder areas in North-West Zimbabwe. A structured questionnaire survey was used to collect information on the control methods used by farmers for the control of bovine <b>dermatophilosis</b> and ticks. A total of 39 plants were used by farmers for various diseases, eleven of these plants {{were used for the}} control of <b>dermatophilosis</b> while three were for tick control. Across the study sites, <b>dermatophilosis</b> was controlled using eleven plants. Among these plants; six plants; Cissus quadrangularis, Catunaregan spinosa, Pterocarpus angolensis Carica papaya, Manihot esculenta and Blumea decurrens which were frequently used were selected for further studies. In vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to validate the efficacy of these plants. The minimum inhibitory concentration and bactericidal concentration assays were used for the in vitro validation of C. quadrangularis, C. spinosa and P. angolensis. Dermatophilus congolensis was more sensitive to P. angolensis average MIC = 0. 63 mg/ml than to C. quadrangularis average MIC = iii 1. 25 mg/ml and C. spinosa average MIC = 2. 08 mg/ml. Cissus quadrangularis was selected for in vivo studies as this plant was the one most frequently used by farmers. Its therapeutic efficacy was compared to conventional antibiotics that farmers used to treat <b>dermatophilosis</b> infection. In the in vivo trials C. quadrangularis did not lead to appreciable reduction in clinical disease compared to the conventional drugs. The larval packet assay was the in vitro assay used to validate the efficacy of Carica papaya, Manihot esculenta and Blumea decurrens against larvae of A. hebraeum and Rhipicephalus appendiculatus. Manihot esculenta at 20 % w/v exhibited the highest larvicidal activity against R. appendiculatus. In the in vivo study, efficacy of the plants were investigated on naturally tick-infested cattle. Mannihot esculenta exhibited the largest tick load reduction compared to the other two plants but its performance was lower than that of conventional acaricides. The effect of A. variegatum and A. hebraeum on bovine <b>dermatophilosis</b> was investigated by evaluating how {{the presence or absence of}} these ticks and other herd level risk factors predicted clinical <b>dermatophilosis</b> and its prevalence at herd level. A structured questionnaire survey {{was carried out}} to collect data on potential risk factors. At the same time, cattle were physically examined for the presence of bovine <b>dermatophilosis,</b> according to a pre-defined case definition, and presence or absence of Amblyomma ticks was also recorded. The multivariable binary logistic model was developed with disease status as outcome, tick presence and infestion and herd level risk factors as predictors. Of the herds examined clinical bovine <b>dermatophilosis</b> was detected in 45 % (84 / 185; 95 % CI: 38. 2, 52. 6 %) of them. Herds infested with Amblyomma variegatum were associated with higher odds (OR= 6. 8; iv 95 % CI: 1. 71, 27. 10) of clinical <b>dermatophilosis</b> while the association was not significant (P > 0. 05) in A. hebraeum infested herds.

40|$|An {{outbreak}} of an atypical form of ovine <b>dermatophilosis</b> affecting the lips and muzzle {{with a very}} high morbidity in weaners and hoggets in Kenya is reported. Clinical diagnosis of ovine <b>dermatophilosis</b> was made and confirmed by direct microscopic examination as well as isolation and identification of Dermatophilus congolensis from scab material from the affected sheep. The morbidity rate within the flock was 31. 8 % (237 / 745) with 98. 3 % (233 / 237) of the affected sheep being weaners and hoggets. No fatalities were recorded. The lesions, confined in the lips and the muzzle, were swelling of both {{the upper and lower}} lips, circumscribed lumps in the skin of both the upper and lower lips, oedema of the head and the submandibular area and scabs and crusts on the lips and muzzle. Within 1 week following treatment with long acting oxytetracycline (20 %) at a rate of 20 mg/kg body weight, intramuscularly and a topical application of oxytetracycline spray, lumps regressed in size and were covered by dark-brown scabs. Removal of the dark-brown scabs revealed erythematous areas covered with purulent material and horny erythematous projections (papillae) projecting from the surfaces.

40|$|Bovine <b>dermatophilosis</b> is {{a severe}} skin {{infection}} of tropical ruminants inducing a severe loss in productivity and a 15 % mortality rate. This disease {{is caused by}} the actinomycete bacterium Dermatophilus congolensis associated with the tick Amblyomma variegatum. Currently there are no prospects for a vaccine, and acaricide or antibiotic control is hampered by the development of chemoresistance. Animal breeders have observed that <b>dermatophilosis</b> susceptibility seems to be determined genetically, and we previously identified a BoLA-DRB 3 -DQB class II haplotype marker for high (R 2 = 0. 96) susceptibility to the disease. With this marker, we developed a successful eugenic selection procedure for zebu Brahman cattle in Martinique (FWI). Over a period of five years, a marked reduction in disease prevalence, from 0. 76 to 0. 02 was achieved, and this low level has been maintained over the last two years. The selection procedure, based on a genetic marker system targeting the highly polymorphic BoLA locus, eliminates only those individuals which are at the highest risk of contracting the disease. In the present work, we discuss the properties of this system, including the "heterozygote advantage" and the "frequency dependence" theories, and examine their involvement in the biological mechanisms at the host/pathogen interface.

40|$|<b>Dermatophilosis</b> is a {{skin disease}} {{caused by a}} {{bacterium}} called Dermatophilus congolensis. The disease affects many species of domestic and wild animals and occasionally, humans. It is most prevalent in the tropics. The lesions are characterized by an exudative dermatitis with scab formation. The disease causes severe skin matting resulting in hide depreciation, overall decrease in animal productivity and, in severe cases, mortality in susceptible weak animals may {{be as high as}} 50 % in the absence of treatment. Although only recently described (Gitao et al., 1990), camel <b>dermatophilosis</b> is recognised as widespread in several camel rearing countries in the tropics. Natural D. congolensis infection of camels was first reported in Kenya in semi-arid conditions.

Camel calves were more likely to be infected than adults. Lesions began as hair matting and later developed into hard crusts. Fatality ranged from 10 to 30 %. The most effective control measure of this disease was thought to be through control of tick infestations. Several treatment regimes were tried in other animal species but with varying degrees of success.

Most outbreaks occurred after rains and affected sheep of different ages, with morbidity rates of 0. 77 % to 31 %. Clinical signs were dermatitis with crusts that stood out easily and left areas of alopecia. Dermatophilus congolensis was isolated in cultures in 5 % sheep blood agar {{by means of}} Haalstra’s method. Histologically, the epidermis showed extensive multifocal areas of ortho and parakeratotic hyperkeratosis with intracorneal microabscesses and presence of D. congolensis.

Identification of the agent: Dermatophilus congolensis normally affects the epidermis, causing the formation of scabs. it may be demonstrated in smears made from scabs emulsified or softened in water or in impression smears {{from the base of}} freshly removed adherent scabs. The organism is Gram positive, but its morphology is more readily appreciated in smears stained with Giemsa. In stained smears, the organism is seen as branching filaments containing multiple rows of cocci. This characteristic appearance is diagnostic. In wet or secondarily infected scabs, only free cocci may be present, so that staining by immunofluorescence is necessary. Dermatophilus congolensis is demonstrated in histopathological sections by Giemsa staining or by immunofluorescence. Dermatophilus cheloniae may be found in crocodiles, chelonids and cobras. Isolation of D. congolensis from freshly removed scabs is straightforward, but the organism is readily overgrown by other bacteria. When cultured from contaminated sites, special techniques involving filtration, chemotaxis, or selective media are necessary. Demonstration and identification of D. congolensis by immunofluorescence is a reliable and very sensitive method of diagnosis, but requires that laboratories make their own diagnostic antisera as these are not available commercially. Although antigenic cross-reaction with Nocardia spp. has been reported, this is likely to give only weak fluorescence. Ideally, a monoclonal antibody specific to D. congolensis should be used. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based characterisation has a/so been developed. Serological tests: A variety of serological tests has been used in studies of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of <b>dermatophilosis.</b> Antibody can be demonstrated in all but fetal blood in healthy ruminants, but the elevated levels associated with clinical infection can be used to identify animals that have been infected with the disease. Requirements for vaccines and diagnostic biologicals: Despite the identification of severa...|$|E

40|$|Extract] The skin is {{the most}} {{valuable}} product of crocodile farming and any disease affecting it diminishes {{the quality of the}} leather and hence its market value. So called brown spot disease, characterised by multiple, small, tan to brown lesions on skin in most body locations, has been recognised by farmers as an important disease problem because affected hides are downgraded. Several reports on crocodilian skin lesions have described the presence of a branching, filamentous organism and on this basis a tentative diagnosis of probable <b>dermatophilosis</b> has been made. Similar lesions have been noted in alligators' and a filamentous organism resembling Dermatophilus was isolated from several animals with brown spot lesions on one farm in Louisiana...|$|E
40|$|Blowfly {{strike and}} the methods used to combat blowfly strike were {{recorded}} on 33 properties in the Rûens area of South Africa during 2003 / 2004. Data were recorded on Merino and Dohne Merino hoggets (n = 4951) with at least 3 months' wool growth. The following data were captured: {{presence or absence of}} strike, site of the strike (body or breech), presence or absence of <b>dermatophilosis</b> as well as subjective scores for wool quality and wool colour. Control measures recorded include: chemical treatment (preventative and spot treatment), crutching, mulesing {{and the use of the}} Lucitrap® system. Blowfly strike was not significantly influenced by gender or breed. Hoggets suffering from <b>dermatophilosis</b> were more likely to be struck, compared with contemporaries not suffering from the skin disorder (0. 057 vs 0. 027; P < 0. 05). Merino hoggets generally had higher scores than their Dohne Merino contemporaries for wool quality (32. 6 vs 27. 4; P< 0. 05) and wool colour (29. 0 vs 27. 2; P< 0. 05). There was an indication that the Lucitrap® system may have reduced flystrike, but the effect was not statistically significant (P = 0. 19 for overall strikes and P = 0. 12 for body strike). The Mules operation benefited overall flystrike (0. 013 vs 0. 110; P < 0. 05); mainly through an effect on breech strike (0. 010 vs 0. 109; P < 0. 05). The proportion of fly strikes increased with wool length, and declined with an increase in farm size in wool colour score. None of the ethically acceptable control measures assessed could substantially reduce blowfly strike on their own, and an integrated pest management programme was proposed...|$|E
40|$|An {{abattoir}} {{survey to}} determine the prevalence of zoonotic diseases encountered at postmortem examination of organs and carcasses was conducted in Maiduguri municipality, Nigeria, between 2000 and 2009. A total of 1, 378, 066 animals were examined and slaughtered from which 403, 560 were cattle, 381, 601 goats, 373, 567 sheep and 219, 308 camels. Out of these numbers, a total of 14, 944 bacterial and parasitic zoonotic diseases were diagnosed which included tuberculosis (67. 6 %), <b>dermatophilosis</b> (15. 8 %), mange (16. 7 %), fascioliasis (1. 5 %) and hydatidosis (4. 3 %). Occurrence of the diseases based on sex, species of animals and season of the year did not show any significant difference (P> 0. 05). It {{was not possible to}} get the exact records on breed and age for each slaughtered animal due to poor recording systems at the abattoir. With regards to the type of animals brought for slaughter, almost all animals come from the traditional sector and it was difficult to precisely trace back the geographical origins of all animals slaughtered due to lack of reliable animal identification method and so relating the finding of the study to a particular locality becomes difficult. Species-specific prevalence of tuberculosis was 1. 6 %, 0. 4 %, 0. 3 %, 0. 3 % for cattle, sheep, goats and camels respectively with a 0. 7 % crude prevalence. Analysis of the tuberculosis cases showed a high rate of occurrence in cattle (P< 0. 05) and the most affected organs were the lungs (55. 1 %) and associated lymph nodes (27. 7 %) (P< 0. 05). It was concluded that zoonotic diseases such as tuberculosis, <b>dermatophilosis</b> and mange are endemic in the study area.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the occurrence of skin diseases in farmed crocodiles in Australia. Six farms, three in Queensland and three in the Northern Territory were visited during the period May to August 1996. Samples of skin with lesions were obtained and data on morbidity and mortality, possible aetiological agents, and other likely predisposing factors were collected. The approximate number of crocodiles on these farms varied from 800 to 3, 000. Furthermore, pathology case records of histopathological slides of crocodile skin lesions on file from 1989 to 1995 were included. All data gathered on recent (1996) cases, especially the gross and microscopic findings were combined for analysis with the data on retrospectively examined cases of skin diseases on file in the Australian Institute of Tropical Veterinary and Animal Science, James Cook University of North Queensland. Two hundred and three lesions (119 were from retrospectively examined cases and 84 were recent) from 180, mostly young crocodiles were examined. The skin lesions were obtained from crocodiles on nine farms, from a group of experimental animals and from one adult found dead in the wild. Necropsies were performed either on the crocodile farms, at James Cook University, or at the Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries - Berrimah Veterinary Laboratory, Northern Territory. The histopathological and bacteriological examination of the 84 recent cases was carried out at the Australian Institute of Tropical Veterinary and Animal Science. Samples of skin with poxvirus lesions were examined with an electron microscope. Five specific skin diseases in uncomplicated form including <b>dermatophilosis,</b> mycotic dermatitis, poxvirus infection, probable mycobacterial dermatitis and capillariasis were identified. <b>Dermatophilosis</b> was the most prevalent skin disease and was also frequently diagnosed, being present in 62 of 66 (94...|$|E
40|$|Dermatophilus congolensis is a gram {{positive}} bacterium {{which causes}} a skin disease {{in a wide}} range of animals including man. This disease is called <b>dermatophilosis,</b> commonly known as rain rot. <b>Dermatophilosis</b> causes extensive damage within the animal industry, including loss of days at work, reduction in milk yield, and deterioriation of hide and meat quality. This disease requires quick diagnostic tools and sustainable treatment to avoid economic losses. ^ The 1029 bp DNA segment of the alkaline ceramidase gene of D. congolensis was targeted to develop a species-specific PCR to speed up the diagnostic and treatment process to minimize economic losses. The PCR is sensitive, specific and detects as low as 50 × 10 - 3 µg of D. congolensis DNA within 4 hours. This PCR has potential clinical application for rapid diagnosis of <b>dermatophilosis.</b> ^ Caprylic acid is a medium chain fatty acid that contains 8 carbons in its structure. Caprylic acid and its derivatives, namely monocaprylin and sodium caprylate, are naturally occurring and proven to be potential alternatives for traditional antimicrobials. This research indicated that minimum inhibitory concentrations of caprylic acid, monocaprylin and sodium caprylate on D. congolensis were 7. 5 mM, 2. 5 mM, 15 mM respectively. The minimum bactericidal concentrations of caprylic acid, monocaprylin and sodium caprylate on D. congolensis were 15 mM, 5 mM and 70 mM respectively. Electron microscopy experiments indicated that caprylic acid disrupts the plasma membrane of the bacteria. These compounds could potentially be used to treat D. congolensis infection. ^ NMR experiments were conducted to study the interaction of the D. congolensis membrane with caprylic acid. These NMR experiments indicated that caprylic acid binds to aromatic amino acids on the surface membrane proteins of D. congolensis. However it was not clear how these compounds exert their antibacterial action on D. congolensis. Elucidation of the antimicrobial mechanisms was attempted through a proteomic approach. It was found that caprylic acid down-regulates RNA polymerase B, superoxide dismutase and heat shock proteins. Down regulation of RNA polymerase B disrupts the transcriptional mechanism, and down regulation of superoxide dismutase renders the cell vulnerable to oxidative damage. ^ Species specific PCR to detect D. congolensis is very sensitive, specific and could be potentially used to detect D. congolensis, however further research is needed to ascertain the sensitivity and specificity of this PCR with clinical samples from the infected animals. Caprylic acid exerts its antimicrobial action on D. congolensis by disrupting the plasma membrane and inhibiting various cellular pathway by inhibiting the production RNA polymerase B, super oxide dismutase and heat shock proteins. Results of this research indicate that caprylic acid and its derivatives have the potential as alternatives to antibiotics currently in use. In vivo efficacy of Caprylic acid and its derivatives needs to be studied in order to use these compounds to their full potential. ...|$|E
40|$|Vector-borne {{diseases}} are among major health constraints of small ruminant in Ethiopia. While various studies on single vector-borne diseases or presence of vectors have been conducted, no summarized evidence {{is available on}} the occurrence of these diseases and the related vectors. This systematic literature review provides a comprehensive summary on major vectors and vector-borne diseases in small ruminants in Ethiopia. Search for published and unpublished literature was conducted between 8 th of January and 25 th of June 2015. The search was both manual and electronic based. The databases used in electronic search were PubMed, Web of Science, CAB Direct and AJOL. For most of the vector-borne diseases, the summary was limited to narrative synthesis due to lack of sufficient data. Meta-analysis was computed for trypanosomosis and <b>dermatophilosis</b> while, meta-regression and sensitivity analysis was done only for trypanososmosis due to lack of sufficient report on <b>dermatophilosis.</b> Owing emphasis to their vector role, ticks and flies were summarized narratively at genera/species level. In line with, 43 peer-reviewed articles passed the inclusion criteria out of 106 initially identified research reports. Data on 7 vector-borne diseases were extracted at species and region level from each source. Accordingly, the pooled prevalence estimate of trypanosomosis was 3. 7 % with 95 % confidence interval (CI) 2. 8, 4. 9), while that of <b>dermatophilosis</b> was 3. 1 % (95 % CI: 1. 6, 6. 0). The in-between study variance noted for trypanosomosis was statistically significant (p < 0. 05). Among the three covariates considered for meta-regression, only one (species) fitted the final model significantly (p < 0. 05) and explained 65. 44 % of the between studies variance (R 2). The prevalence in sheep (5. 5 %) increased nearly by 34 % compared to goats (2. 9 %). The parasitic presence in blood was documented for babesiosis (3. 7 % in goats); and anaplasmosis (3. 9 % in sheep). Serological evidence was retrieved for bluetongue ranging from 34. 1 % to 46. 67 % in sheep, and coxiellosis was 10. 4 % in goats. There was also molecular evidence on the presence of theileriosis in sheep (93 %, n = 160) and goats (1. 9 %, n = 265). Regarding vectors of veterinary importance, 14 species of ticks in five genera, four species of Glossina and 4 genera of biting flies were reported. Despite the evidence on presence of various vectors including ticks, flies, mosquitoes and midges, research report on vector-borne diseases in Ethiopia are surprisingly rare. Especially considering the ongoing climate change, which is likely to affect distribution of vectors, better evidence on the current situation is urgently needed in order to prevent spread or to model future distribution scenarios.
