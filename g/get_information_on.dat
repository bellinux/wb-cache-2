25|$|Variation under {{domestication}} {{became a}} major topic of research: in 1855 he began to develop a web of contacts, both in the UK and worldwide, to <b>get</b> <b>information</b> <b>on</b> the origins and variation of domesticated animals, particularly poultry, ducks, rabbits, and pigeons. He got extensive information, specimens and ideas from Edward Blyth in India, who put him in contact with Edgar Leopold Layard in South Africa. At the suggestion of William Yarrell, Darwin began pigeon breeding at Down House to investigate varieties of domestic pigeons, and gained access to the expertise of William Bernhard Tegetmeier who was glad to research aspects of interest to Darwin. From March, he also got information and specimens from his relative William Darwin Fox who bred poultry and ducks at his rectory in the parish of Delamere, Cheshire.|$|E
25|$|The {{electronic}} device performing the computations is synced with a clock that is running at frequencies {{on the order}} of mega-hertz (MHz) to giga-hertz (GHz). However, due to hardware pipelining, and complexity of some instructions, some operations take multiple clock cycles to complete. Therefore, it is not always necessary to sample the signal at such a high clock rate. It is often possible to <b>get</b> <b>information</b> <b>on</b> all or most of the operations while sampling {{on the order of}} kilo-hertz (kHz). Different devices leak information at different frequencies. For example, Intel’s Atom processor will leak keys during RSA and AES encryption at frequencies between 50MHz and 85MHz. Android version 4.4’s Bouncy Castle library implementation of ECDSA is vulnerable to key extraction side channel attacks around the 50kHz range.|$|E
25|$|Every ship in {{the line}} within range began firing. At 1844, after more than ten {{and a half hours}} of attacks, U-546 rolled under and sank (in {{position}} , south-south-east of Cape Farewell, Greenland). Her captain and most of her crew were rescued by US vessels, and taken to Argentia Naval Station, Newfoundland. Eight of the surviving, captured crewmen of U-546 were tortured by US military personnel. Historian Philip K. Lundeberg has written that the beating and torture of U-546's survivors was a singular atrocity motivated by the interrogators' need to quickly <b>get</b> <b>information</b> <b>on</b> what the U.S. believed were potential cruise missile or ballistic missile attacks on the continental US by German submarines. The USN eventually learned that no V-1/2 attacks from the U-boats were planned by the Kriegsmarine.|$|E

25|$|The two agents {{attempt to}} <b>get</b> <b>information</b> <b>on</b> Masters by putting {{one of his}} {{criminal}} associates, attorney Max Waxman, under surveillance. Vukovich falls asleep on watch, and consequently they fail to catch Masters {{in the act of}} murdering Waxman. While Vukovich wants to go by the book, Chance becomes increasingly reckless and unethical in his efforts to catch Masters. While Chance relies on his sexual-extortion relationship with parolee/informant Ruth for information, Vukovich meets privately with Masters' attorney, Bob Grimes. Grimes, acknowledging a potential conflict of interest that could ruin his legal practice, agrees to set up a meeting between his client and the two agents, who engage Masters by posing as bankers from Palm Springs interested in Masters' counterfeiting services. Masters is reluctant to work with them, but ultimately agrees to print them $1,000,000 worth of fake bills.|$|E

500|$|The book {{received}} mixed reviews. Caroline Foulkes {{wrote in}} The Birmingham Post: [...] "The {{thing about this}} biography is the depths to which Taraborrelli has dug to <b>get</b> <b>information</b> <b>on</b> a famously controlling woman. He relates revealing anecdotes {{as if they were}} mere bagatelle, making News of the World style revelations look like kid's stuff. If Taraborrelli were to include in his list of acknowledgments 'thanks to the maid who let me into Madonna's bedroom to raid her underwear drawer', it wouldn't be any great surprise." [...] She also felt that [...] "despite the sensationalism, Taraborrelli's writing style lets him down. Too often it descends into the kind of mush you expect from an airport novel, with the singer coming across more like a character from Shirley Conran's Lace than a real woman." [...] Peter Sobczynski reviewed the book for the Post-Tribune and felt that [...] "the problem with writing an unauthorized tell-all biography is that, in this information-rich world that we live in, by the time a book gets written on somebody, most of the juicy stories are already common knowledge. To make up for that, the tell-all author needs to fill his or her pages with either a thoughtful analysis of the subject at hand, or, frankly, newer and better dirt. Unfortunately, celebrity biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli does neither with his latest concoction, Madonna: An Intimate Biography." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 2008, working for The National Campaign Fund, Floyd Brown {{launched}} what he called [...] "the most internet-intensive effort for an ad debut ever" [...] to disseminate via what he claimed was three to five million emails to conservatives the implication that Barack Obama had been [...] "soft" [...] on crime as a state senator in Illinois before his presidential candidacy. [...] The initiative was funded by a political action committee calling itself the [...] "National Campaign Fund," [...] which had $14,027 in the bank {{at the end of}} March, 2008. Other Brown-established groups to raise funds in this effort include a 527 group, Citizens for a Safe and Prosperous America. [...] Brown also uses a 501(c)(4) non-profit to raise funds for the Policy Issues Institute. [...] Brown made appearances to promote his ad and his company on a news network, Fox News, [...] In response to the attack ad, Newsweek published a report on the ad, saying it was the attempt of [...] "a conservative ad man striving to regain his Willie Horton notoriety" [...] and directed readers to factcheck.org to <b>get</b> <b>information</b> <b>on</b> Obama's voting record. [...] The report includes a swipe at MSNBC's Chris Matthews for airing the ad continuously, pointing to Brown's strategy of getting [...] "free" [...] air time for ads by making them controversial.|$|E
