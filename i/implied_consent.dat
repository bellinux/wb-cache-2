Under current law, that occupancy could {{not be viewed as}} undertaken with the <b>implied</b> <b>consent</b> of the government, as was the occupancy in Cramer. We therefore conclude that any individual occupancy rights acquired by the Danns must have had their inception prior to November 26, 1934, the date that the lands in question were withdrawn from entry by Executive Order No. 6910.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two ways}} to give consent: {{explicit}} consent or <b>implied</b> <b>consent.</b> Explicit consent is when a patient clearly communicates to a healthcare worker, verbally or in writing or in some other way, that relevant confidential information can be shared. <b>Implied</b> <b>consent,</b> means that a patient's consent to share personal confidential information is assumed. When personal confidential information is shared between healthcare workers, consent is taken as implied.|$|E

5000|$|Generally, {{sovereign}} nations must consent {{in order}} to be bound by a particular treaty or legal norm. However, international customary laws are norms that have become pervasive enough internationally that countries need not consent {{in order to}} be bound. In these cases, all that is needed is that the state has not objected to the law. However, states that object to customary international law before these laws may not be bound by them unless these laws are deemed to be jus cogens. [...] However, in a dispute with any nation that has not affirmed the [...] "silence implies consent" [...] principle, any invocation of the [...] "silence implies consent" [...] principle involves an appeal to custom, such that if that nation does not espouse the broader premise of acknowledging the existence of customary international law, such an appeal will depend on circular reasoning ("customary international law is binding because silence <b>implies</b> <b>consent,</b> and silence <b>implies</b> <b>consent</b> because the fact that silence <b>implies</b> <b>consent</b> is one aspect of customary international law").|$|R

25|$|By the mid-20th century, {{most major}} vice {{activities}} were being actively targeted {{by law enforcement}} in the state. Though alcohol sale and consumption was legalized, in many areas it was still substantially restricted and, even today, some counties in the state remain dry or retain significant restrictions. Most other activities went underground and have remained largely hidden. In 1969, major legislation was enacted directed at alcohol and narcotics. The <b>Implied</b> <b>Consent</b> law was passed requiring that drivers agree to breath tests when arrested for suspicion of driving while intoxicated. Statutes against narcotics were strengthened giving police and prosecutors more ability to target offenders.|$|E
25|$|As a {{trademark}} {{must be used}} to maintain rights in relation to that mark, {{a trademark}} can be 'abandoned' or its registration can be cancelled or revoked if the mark is not continuously used. By comparison, patents and copyrights cannot be 'abandoned' and a patent holder or copyright owner can generally enforce their rights without taking any particular action to maintain the patent or copyright. Additionally, patent holders and copyright owners may not necessarily need to actively police their rights. However, a failure to bring a timely infringement suit or action against a known infringer may give the defendant a defense of <b>implied</b> <b>consent</b> or estoppel when suit is finally brought.|$|E

Fourth, the Court {{rejected the}} statute limiting the time in which the government could challenge the validity of its land patents, holding that did not apply to suits on behalf of Indians. Fifth, the Court rejected estoppel: [...] "Since these Indians with the <b>implied</b> <b>consent</b> of the government had acquired such rights of occupancy as entitled them to retain possession as against the defendants, no officer or agent of the government had authority to deal with the land upon any other theory." [...] Finally, however, the Court reversed the Ninth Circuit's voiding of the entire patents, holding that only the portions possessed by the Indians should be void.|$|E
500|$|The {{principle}} in English law that a husband could not rape {{his wife had}} long been supposed to be correct, although R v R was the first {{case in which the}} marital rape exemption reached the House of Lords. [...] As late {{as the end of the}} nineteenth century family judges were still prepared to make orders for [...] "restitution of conjugal rights" [...] against estranged wives. [...] However by that time the statement in Hale had already been doubted by some judges. R v R followed several cases earlier in the 20th century which had progressively narrowed the exemption. In R v Clarke [...] 2 All ER 448; 33 Cr App R 216 a husband was found guilty of raping his estranged wife, as it was held that a court order for non-cohabitation had revoked the consent.

In order to demand a person produce a breathalyzer sample an officer must have [...] "reasonable suspicion" [...] that the person drove with more than 80mg alcohol per 100 mL of blood. The demand must be within three hours of driving. Any driver that refuses can be charged under s.254 of the Criminal Code. Most states, including California and Michigan, have <b>implied</b> <b>consent</b> laws, which means that by applying for a driver's license, drivers are agreeing to take any breathalyzer test under suspicion of a DUI.

These phases of the walk remained written on John's memory, each emphasised by the touch of that light hand on his arm; and behind all these aspects of the nocturnal city he saw, in his mind's-eye, a picture of the lighted drawing-room at home where he had sat talking with Flora; and his father, from the other end, had looked on with a kind and ironical smile. John had read the significance of that smile, which might have escaped a stranger.

60|$|Now {{as a law}} {{directed}} against {{the mass of the}} nation has not the nature of a reasonable institution, so neither has it the authority: for in all forms of government the people is the true legislator; and whether the immediate and instrumental cause of the law be a single person or many, the remote and efficient cause is the consent of the people, either actual or implied; and such consent is absolutely essential to its validity. To the solid establishment of every law two things are essentially requisite: first, a proper and sufficient human power to declare and modify the matter of the law; and next, such a fit and equitable constitution as {{they have a right to}} declare and render binding. With regard to the first requisite, the human authority, it is their judgment they give up, not their right. The people, indeed, are presumed to consent to whatever the legislature ordains for their benefit; and they are to acquiesce in it, though they do not clearly see into the propriety of the means by which they are conducted to that desirable end. This they owe as an act of homage and just deference to a reason which the necessity of government has made superior to their own. But though the means, and indeed the nature, of a public advantage may not always be evident to the understanding of the subject, no one is so gross and stupid as not to distinguish between a benefit and an injury. No one can imagine, then, an exclusion of a great body of men, not from favors, privileges, and trusts, but from the common advantages of society, can ever be a thing intended for their good, or can ever be ratified by any <b>implied</b> <b>consent</b> of theirs. If, therefore, at least an implied human consent is necessary to the existence of a law, such a constitution cannot in propriety be a law at all.|$|E

40|$|The {{legal basis}} for {{processing}} personal data {{and some other}} types of Big Data is often the informed consent of the data subject involved. Many data controllers, such as social network sites, offer terms and conditions, privacy policies or similar documents to which a user can consent when registering as a user. There are many issues with such informed consent: people get too many consent requests to read everything, policy documents are often very long and difficult to understand and users feel {{they do not have}} a real choice anyway. Furthermore, in the context of Big Data refusing consent may not prevent predicting missing data. Finally, consent is usually asked for when registering, but rarely is consent renewed. As a result, <b>consenting</b> once often <b>implies</b> <b>consent</b> forever. At the same time, given the rapid changes in Big Data and data analysis, consent may easily get outdated (when earlier consent no longer reflects a user’s preferences).
