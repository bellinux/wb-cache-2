5|$|State-run junior lyceums {{and area}} {{secondary}} schools are single-sex. Junior lyceums {{are divided into}} two grade stages. The first stage is an <b>introductory</b> stage, and runs {{for the first two}} years of secondary schooling.

This orientation is similar at area secondary schools, although the <b>introductory</b> period is longer, at three years in duration, and the final specialist period is shorter, at two years. The staff-student ratio is set at 1:11, and the school leaving age is 16.|$|E
