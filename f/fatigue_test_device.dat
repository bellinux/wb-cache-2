40|$|International audienceBoth {{experimental}} and numerical approaches {{were developed to}} follow cracking damage in steel cylinder/plane fretting fatigue contact subjected to variable loading conditions. For the experimental approach, the potential drop technique was implemented on the fretting <b>fatigue</b> <b>test</b> <b>device</b> to observe on-line crack propagation. A calibration curve relating crack length and potential provided direct knowledge of cracking status. Numerically, total life was separated between crack nucleation and crack propagation. To formalize crack nucleation prediction, Crossland multiaxial fatigue behavior was applied at a critical distance {{to take into account}} the severe fretting fatigue gradients. The crack propagation rate was formalized using Kujawski’s fatigue crack driving force parameter, View the MathML sourceK‾∗, and coupling the Paris law of the material. Using this combined crack-nucleation/crack-propagation analysis, constant fretting fatigue conditions and variable fretting fatigue sequences were investigated. Good correlations were observed. Finally, the influence of different plastic laws was investigated. Both monotonic and cyclic approximations provided good correlation with experimental data, the cyclic description being closer...|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{this project}} was to study the {{fretting}} behaviour of the cemented femoral stem fixation of a total hip prosthesis, trying to capture the loss of contact between the femoral stem and polymetylmethacrilate cement fixation. To have a landmark, studies were performed compared with cementless fixation, where no fretting phenomenon occurs, on real prostheses, under biological 3 D loading conditions. A <b>fatigue</b> <b>test</b> <b>device,</b> installed on a servo-hydraulic triaxial dynamic testing machine was used. It allowed monitoring the flexion-extension, abduction-adduction, inner-outer rotation movements, and the variation of the torsional torque, depending on normal loading. The test ends when the sample does not fail after 2000000 cycles, or when it has reached a predetermined number of cycles. Test fluid medium used was NaCl mixed with distilled water, a favourable environment for appearance of fretting corrosion. After the failure of stem fixation at 2450000 cycles, the mantle of bone cement remaining adherent on femoral stem was removed. Microscopic inspection of the femoral stem and of the inner part of the polymetylmethacrilate mantle demonstrated the existence of corrosion of the femoral stem surface beneath the cement mantle, and Fe 2 O 3 deposits on the femoral stem surface and on the inner part of the mantle...|$|E

This is of great importance when dealing with durability: due to the softness of such a support, the pavement is subjected to considerable strains that may generate top-down cracks in the layer at right angles of the orthotropic plate stiffeners and shear cracks at the interface between pavement and steel. Therefore, a five-point bending fatigue test was developed and improved since 2003 at the ENTPE laboratory, to test different asphalt concrete mixes. This study aims at modelling the mechanical behavior of the wearing course throughout the fatigue test by a finite element method (Comsol Multiphysics software). Each material steel, sealing sheet, asphalt concrete layer is considered and modelled. The modelling of asphalt concrete is complex since it is a heterogeneous material, a viscoelastic medium and it thermosensitive. The actual characteristics of the asphalt concrete (thermo physical parameter and viscoelastic complex modulus) are determined experimentally on cylindrical cores. Moreover, a damage law based on Miner's damage {{is included in the}} model. The modelling of the fatigue test leads to encouraging results. Finally, modelling's results are compared to the experimental data obtained from the five-point bending <b>fatigue</b> <b>test</b> <b>device.</b> The experimental data are very consistent with the numerical simulation...|$|E

A composicao quimica da liga NiTi foi analisada semi-quantitativamente por espectroscopia de energia de raios-X (EDS), as fases presentes foram identificadas atraves de analises por difratometria de raios-XDRX, as temperaturas de transformacao identificadas por calorimetria exploratoria diferencial (DSC) e o acabamento {{superficial}} foi avaliado por microscopia eletronica de varredura (MEV). A avaliacao dimensional foi realizada atraves de fotografias dos instrumentos pelo software Image-Pro Plus 6. 0. Os instrumentos foram divididos em dois grupos: Grupo experimental de fadiga, com 20 instrumentos novos GT e GTX de calibre 20 e taper. 06 (n= 10) ensaiados ate a ruptura em dispositivo de bancada de fadiga, para determinacao do numero de ciclos ate a fratura (NCF). Grupo experimental de torcao com 20 instrumentos novos GT e GTX de calibre 20 e taper. 04 (n= 10) ensaiados em torcao ate a ruptura, para determinacao dos valores medios de torque maximo e de deflexao angular ate a fratura. Os resultados obtidos foram analisados estatisticamente pelo teste ANOVA (95 % de confiabilidade). Todos os instrumentos apresentaram caracteristicas superficiais satisfatorias. A composicao quimica foi a mesma em todos os instrumentos analisados, aproximadamente 50, 5 %Ni- 49, 5 %Ti atomica. Os difratogramas, de GT e GTX, apresentaram apenas a presenca da austenita (fase À, de estrutura B 2) e as temperaturas de transformacao variaram, sugerindo possiveis diferencas nos tratamentos termicos dos fios. Os instrumentos GTX 20 /. 06 apresentaram resistencia a fadiga significativamente maior, quando comparados aos instrumentos GT 20 /. 06. Os instrumentos GT 20 /. 04 apresentaram valores de torque maximos significativamente maiores que os instrumentos GTX, embora menores valores de deflexao angular ate a fratura. Considerando que os dois instrumentos apresentam geometria e diametros similares, e possivel que o tratamento termico utilizado na liga (M-Wire) tenha influenciado o comportamento mecanico dos instrumentos analisados neste estudo. The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the flexural fatigue and torsional resistance of ProFile GT (Dentsply-Maillefer, Baillagues, Switzerland) and ProFile GT Series X (GTX) (Dentsply Tulsa Dental, Oklahoma, USA) instruments, taking into account their structural and dimensional characteristics. The instrument diameter at each millimeter from the tip and pitch length were the dimensional parameters measured. Chemical composition was determined by energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy and phase constitution by x-ray diffraction. Vickers microhardness measurements were performed to assess instrument strength. One group of 20 /. 06 GT and GTX instruments (n = 10 each) was tested until failure in a flexural <b>fatigue</b> <b>test</b> <b>device,</b> whereas another group of 20 /. 04 files (n = 10 each) was tested in torsion based on ISO 3630 - 1. GT and GTX instruments showed approximately the same chemical composition, namely 51 at%Ni- 49 at%Ti (56 wt%Ni- 44 wt%Ti) and contained mainly the â-phase. GTX instruments showed higher intensity x-ray diffraction peaks and a statistically higher Vickers microhardness. There was a significant decrease in the diameter of GTX in relation to GT instruments from D 6 to D 9 for 20 /. 04 instruments and from D 4 to D 7 for 20 /. 06 instruments. Pitch length increased along the active part of both instruments, with a steeper increase in GTX. In general, GT Series X instruments were significantly more resistant to flexural fatigue than were similar GT instruments (p < 0. 001) but exhibited lower torsional strength (p < 0. 001). Different structural and dimensional characteristics were found in GTX instruments in comparison with GT instruments; this is probably the cause for their higher flexural fatigue resistance and lower torsional strength...|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that the microsystem technology field brings relevant technological breakthroughs and social benefits. It aims the developing of advanced systems whose operation normally combined {{two or more of}} the following properties: electrical, mechanical, optical, biological or others, integrated onto a monolithic or hybrid miniaturized structure. Thus, the technological trends of multifunctional integration and miniaturisation are the key points of this new discipline. This works deals with investigating the problematic in development, fabrication and reliability of microsystems with particular attention to complex devices. Specifically, the complex terms refers to the following: silicon based micro-systems containing advanced mechanical components and kinematic architecture enabling the accurate positioning of an end-effector; micro-systems constituted by several components requiring specific materials and 3 D variable shaping, and then assembled. Moreover, the present book aims to evaluate potentialities and manufacture feasibility of PKM (Parallel Kinematic Machine) at millimetre and sub-millimetre scale. In micro applications, two distinct technology solutions can be distinguished. At micro scale, silicon is the most common material as it combines unique electrical and mechanical properties suitable for accomplishing the based functional principles of a micro product. Moreover, the production capabilities of microelectronic foundry can be exploited as well as the batch characteristic for cost effective solutions. This approach leads to a monolithic system with nearly 2 D ½ layout and overall package of few mm 3. Among the main applications, there are accelerometers, pressure sensors and optical micro switching, which involve the oscillation and the deformation of simple mechanical elements as proof mass, beams and cantilever. The challenge here is to establish the production of complex mechanical components and kinematic architectures (as PKM) for the development of advanced mechanical systems. On the other hand, hybrid approach conceive the product as constitute by several parts assembled together, with the further issue of choosing the most appropriate material and production technologies for each component. As far as concerns the creating, the handling and the flexible assembly of 3 D micro sized components, hybrid solution is intrinsic a complex task and the scaling down of existing manufacturing and product principles reach their limits and lead to ineffective industrial solutions. In this context, the feasibility of complex hybrid ceramic and metal-based micro systems is deeply investigated. The present book comprises three principal parts. The first one introduces the microtechnology field. The benefits derived by the miniaturisation and the functional integration are illustrated. Moreover, the most significant factors involved in developing a micro product are illustrated. Furthermore, the most promising fabrication technologies, with particular attention to those that allow the developing of complex micro-devices and the problematic in scaling down the existing fabrication concepts are illustrated. Finally, micro assembly technologies are briefly reviewed. These topics take place in Chapter I. The second part more concerns the investigation of silicon-based solutions. In Chapter II, particular attention is paid to the industrial feasibility of complex micro devices. The study involves the following tasks: prototyping of a micro-hinge anchored to the substrate; development of a 1 DoF multi-body device with planar motion; feasibility study of a multi DoF compliance systems, based on PK architecture, enabling the out of plane positioning of an end-effector. Successively, Chapter III addresses the reliability study of micro electromechanical systems under cyclic loading. The study becomes even more urgent when complex compliance configurations are chosen. The development of an experimental set-up for performing the fatigue test is presented. Moreover, the Woehler parameters of the 15 m thick epitaxial polysilicon are defined. The activities are performed at the MEMS Business Unit of STMicroelectronics, currently the Italian leader company in producing silicon-based products and within the European MACROS (Modelling And Characterization for Reliability Of Silicon MEMS) project. The third part finally deals with potential and limitations in scaling down conventional processes to develop ceramic and metal based complex hybrid solutions. Chapter IV addresses the application of spark erosion processes for machining 3 D micro-components in ceramic composites. The production performance is investigated in details and the roughing–finishing technological parameters are defined. The activities are performed within the Power MEMS Belgian project at the Micro Precision Engineering (MPE) Research Group, Mechanical Engineering Department of the Catholic University of Leuven. The research input is given by the fabrication of micro turbines for fuel based micro power generators. Then, Chapter V deals with the manufacture feasibility using micro cutting processes of a 2 DoF micro mechanism based on parallel kinematic architecture and multi body configuration, with promising applications in the high precision positioning field. The activities are performed within the MEPROMEC project, -Development and industrial application of tools and methodology for the mechatronic design-, founded by the province of Trento, Italy, at the Institute of the Industrial Technologies and Automation of the National Research Council of Italy. The study highlights the critical issues in manufacturing and assembly complex hybrid microsystems, and points out the importance of developing properly clamping units and rough pieces based on Design for Production and Design for Assembly concepts in order to improve the machining accuracy, the handling tasks and the functional integration. Finally, in Chapter VI conclusions and future works are drawn. SOMMARIO	 1 SUMMERY	 3 CONTENTS	 5 CHAPTER I: MICROTECHNOLOGY: STATE OF THE ART. 	 9 1. DEFINITION OF MICROPRODUCT. 	 9 2.

Therefore, in vitro <b>fatigue</b> <b>testing</b> of dental adhesives should predict better the in vivo performance of adhesives. The {{objective of this}} study was to determine the fatigue resistance of two representative adhesives, a self-etch and an etch&rinse adhesive, bonded to enamel and dentin. Therefore, tooth/composite interfaces were cyclically loaded using a miniaturized version of a rotating beam <b>fatigue</b> <b>testing</b> <b>device.</b> Subsequently, the load at which 50 % of the specimens fail after 10 (5) cycles, was determined as the median micro-rotary fatigue resistance (microRFR). For both adhesives, the microRFR was about 30 - 40 % lower than the corresponding micro-tensile bond strength (microTBS) to both enamel and dentin. Analysis of the fracture surfaces by Feg-SEM revealed typical fatigue fracture patterns.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} thorough air drying on the static and dynamic bonding effectiveness of a HEMA-free all-in-one adhesive bonded to Class- 1 cavity-bottom dentin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: G-Bond (GC, Japan) was applied to standard occlusal Class I cavities following either a gentle (1 bar) or strong (4 bar) air-drying technique. After restoring the cavity using a composite resin (Gradia Anterior, GC), microspecimens were prepared that were loaded until failure or inserted in a microrotary <b>fatigue</b> <b>testing</b> <b>device.</b> RESULTS: Strong air drying had no effect on the static (39. 1 vs. 38. 4 MPa) or the dynamic (19. 0 vs. 18. 6 MPa) strength of the interface complex. CONCLUSION: Strong air drying did not improve the static or the dynamic bonding effectiveness, although a very thorough (4 bar) and long air-drying procedure was employed. SEM analysis revealed that even when the adhesive was strongly air dried, droplets originating from phase separations could still be observed, albeit to a reduced extent. Ineffective drying and pooling of the adhesive in a narrow cavity diminished the effect of strong air drying of the all-in-one adhesive. status: publishe...|$|R

All the instruments were rotated until fracture during the cyclic <b>fatigue</b> <b>test</b> and slow-motion videos were captured using high-speed camera. The number of cycles to failure (NCF) was calculated. The data were analyzed statistically using {{one-way analysis of variance}} (ANOVA, p < 0. 05).

In this study, the effect of an additional {{intermediate layer}} of a low-viscosity resin on the microrotary fatigue resistance (microRFR) of a hybrid composite bonded to dentin was evaluated. The hypotheses tested were that an intermediate layer of a low-viscosity resin (i) increases the microRFR to dentin, but (ii) {{has no effect on}} the static bond strength. Microtensile bond strength (microTBS) samples were loaded until failure or inserted in a microrotary <b>fatigue</b> <b>testing</b> <b>device.</b> Specimens were <b>tested</b> at 4 Hz until failure or until 10 (5) cycles were reached. An additional intermediate elastic layer had no effect on the static microTBS, but significantly lowered the median microRFR from 28. 4 MPa to 21. 6 MPa. However, the application of an intermediate flexible layer had, no effect on the static microTBS. In conclusion, an additional elastic intermediate layer did decrease significantly the microRFR (rejection of hypothesis i), but did not alter the microTBS (acceptance of hypothesis ii). The decrease in microRFR most likely may be explained by the lower mechanical properties of the intermediary layer. status: publishe...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was to}} predict NCF and failure location of NiTi rotary instruments by FEM virtual simulation of an experimental nonstatic <b>fatigue</b> <b>test.</b> Methods: ProTaper Next (PTN) X 1, X 2, and X 3 files (DentsplyMaillefer, Baillagues, Switzerland (n = 20 each) were tested to failure using a customized <b>fatigue</b> <b>testing</b> <b>device.</b> The device and file geometries were replicated with computer-aided design software. Computer-aided design geometries (geometric model) were imported and discretized (numeric model). The typical material model of an M-Wire alloy was applied. The numeric model of the device and file geometries were exported for finite element analysis (FEA). Multiaxial random fatigue methodology was used to analyze stress history and predict instrument life. Experimental data from PTN X 2 and X 3 were used for virtual model tuning through a reverse engineering approach to optimize material mechanical properties. Tuned material parameters were used to predict the average NCF and failure locations of PTN X 1 by FEA; t tests were used to compare FEA and experimental findings (P <. 05).

Methodology: 30 new TF instruments were submitted to cyclic <b>fatigue</b> <b>tests.</b> Group 1 instruments were tested using a TFA motion (TFA) while group 2 instruments were used in continuous rotation at 500  rpm (CR). The cyclic <b>fatigue</b> <b>testing</b> <b>device</b> {{used in the present study}} has been used for studies on cyclic fatigue resistance previously. The artificial canal was manufactured to provide the instrument with a very challenging trajectory 60 ° curvature, with a 2  mm radius. All instruments were rotated or reciprocated until fracture occurred. The time to fracture was recorded. All data were subjected to statistical evaluation with analysis of variance test. Results: TFA reciprocating motion showed a significant increase (p <  0. 05) in the time to failure when compared to continuous rotation. Mean time to failure was 131  s (SD ± 25. 2) for group 1 (TFA), and was 68  s (SD ± 14. 8) for continuous rotation group (CR). Conclusions: In accordance with those findings, the results of the present study showed a significant increase of cyclic fatigue resistance of instruments used with the TFA motion. This can be explained by the alternance of engaging/disengaging movements, since the motion can be defined as a non-continuous rotation, while the traditional continuous rotation movement continuously engages and stresses the instruments...|$|R

This might {{compromise the}} bonding effectiveness, {{especially on the}} long-term. Objectives: {{to determine the effect}} of thorough air-blowing on the static and dynamic bonding effectiveness of a HEMA-free all-in-one adhesive bonded to class-I cavity-bottom dentin. Methods: G-Bond (GC, Japan) was applied to standardized occlusal class-I cavities, using either mild or strong air-blowing of the primer. After restoring the cavity using a composite resin (Gradia Anterior, GC) micro-specimens with a rounded composite/dentin interface were prepared. These were inserted in a micro-rotary <b>fatigue</b> <b>testing</b> <b>device</b> (De Munck et al., Biomaterials, 2004), or loaded statically until failure in a similar way as the fatigue set-up (control). <b>Fatigue</b> specimens were <b>tested</b> at 4 Hz until failure or until 105 cycles were reached. The mean load at which 50 % of the samples failed (median micro-rotary fatigue resistance, µRFR) was determined (in MPa) using logistic regression and the 2 groups were compared using multiple logistic regression.

40|$|Purpose: of this paper: Many {{engineering}} components {{operate under}} combined torsion and axial cyclic loading conditions, which {{can result in}} fatigue fracture after a very long life regime of fatigue. This fatigue regime were carried out beyond 109 loading cycles called very high cycle fatigue (VHCF) to understand the fatigue properties and damage mechanisms of materials. Design/methodology/approach: Torsional <b>fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> were conducted using a 20 kHz frequency ultrasonic <b>fatigue</b> <b>testing</b> <b>device.</b> The results obtained were compared {{to those of the}} conventional torsional <b>fatigue</b> <b>test</b> machine operated at 35 Hz to observe any discrepancy in results due to frequency effects between two experiments. Findings: All the <b>fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> were done up to 1010 cycles at room temperature. Damage mechanisms in torsional fatigues such as crack initiation and propagation in different modes were studied by imaging the samples in a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The results of the two kinds of material show that the stress vs. number of cycle curves (S-N curves) display a considerable decrease in fatigue strength beyond 107 cycles. Research limitations/implications: Each test, the strain of specimen in the gage length must be calibrated with a strain gage bonded to the gage section. This is a critical point of this study. The results are very sensitive to the calibration system. Control of the displacement and the output of the power supply are made continuously by computer and recorded the magnitude of the strain in the specimen. Practical implications: torsional <b>fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> has been investigated in the very high cycle fatigue (VHCF) range for two kinds of alloys used very largely in automotive engine components. Based on the test results and analyses presented in this paper, practical applications are being actually carried out in the automotive industry essentially in France. Originality/value: Ultrasonic fatigue damage (VHCF > 109) in VHCF is originally different from classical fatigue (up to 106) by typical internal fish eye formation. Additionally, fatigue crack of all the fractured specimens for the 2 -AS 5 U 3 G-Y 35 specimens initiated at the surface of the specimens.

Objectives: To evaluate the effect of an {{intermediate layer}} of a low-viscosity resin (Protect Liner F, Kuraray) on the fatigue resistance of a hybrid composite (Clearfil Photo Posterior, Kuraray) bonded to dentin using a two-step self-etch adhesive (Protect Bond, Kuraray). The hypotheses tested were that an intermediate layer of a low-viscosity resin (1) increases the fatigue resistance to dentin, but (2) {{has no effect on}} the static bond strength. Methods: Micro-tensile bond strength (µTBS) samples were loaded until failure or inserted in a micro-rotary <b>fatigue</b> <b>testing</b> <b>device</b> (De Munck et al., Biomaterials, 2004). To ensure exact centric alignment throughout the test, the preparation of a round constricted interface area (about 1 mm 2) and the <b>fatigue</b> <b>testing</b> itself were performed in the same lathe.

Materials and methods: The following cements were used in this study for bonding two zirconia blocks that were tribochemically silica-coated with the Rocatec system: Super Bond C&B (SB); Panavia Fluoro Cement (PF); and Fuji Luting (FL). Specimens were subsequently subjected to three storage conditions: 106 compressive cyclic impact loading (CL), 106 shear cyclic impact loading (SL), and no cyclic impact loading (Control) in distilled water at 37  °C with a mechanical <b>fatigue</b> <b>testing</b> <b>device.</b> Shear bond strength tests were performed with a universal testing machine. Results: Bond strengths of PF+Control (63. 6 ± 2. 4  MPa) and PF+CL (57. 2 ± 3. 8  MPa) were significantly higher than those with SB and FL. There was no significant difference between CL and SL (P> 0. 05) with SB and FL. The bond strength of the FL resin-modified glass ionomer cement was significantly lower than those with PF and SB. After applying tribochemical treatment, all specimens subjected to cyclic impact loading exhibited cohesive failure in the resin cement.

Materials and Methods: Forty-six particulate filler composite (PFC) beams and 76 fiber-reinforced composite (FRC) beams were prefabricated and subsequently luted (RelyX ARC or Panavia F 2. 0) onto flat ground bovine enamel. The SFL of the different specimen types was determined with a peel test and the DEL was determined with a rotating cantilever beam <b>fatigue</b> <b>testing</b> <b>device.</b> Results: The PFC specimens showed a significantly lower SFL than the FRC specimens. The luting cement showed a significant effect on the SFL of the PFC specimens, but not with FRC. The DEL of PFC specimens was significantly lower than for FRC specimens. The luting cement showed a significant effect on the DFL of the PFC specimens, but not so with FRC. With both the SFL and the DEL tests all PFC beams fractured, leaving the bonded part on the tooth surface, but FRC beams partially debonded from the tooth surface, leaving fibers connected to the enamel surface to a varying extent. Coincidentally, the uncured fibers turned out to be prone to aging, an effect which has been investigated. Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study, it can be concluded that PFC without fiber reinforcement is not suitable for the fabrication of two-unit cantilever RBFDPs, despite the significant effect of the luting cement, but FRC is suitable...|$|R

40|$|NiTi {{shape memory}} alloys present {{themselves}} as high potential candidate in several applications. This fact arises from their superior attributes such as large stress output, recoverable strain and outstanding biocompatibility. Fatigue life prediction of bulk shape memory alloys have been extensively investigated in the literature. Yet so far, {{information about the}} fatigue life prediction on NiTi thin films is rarely discussed or missing which might limit the window of future applications. In this thesis, NiTi freestanding films with nearly equiatomic composition were fabricated by means of magnetron sputtering, UV lithography, and wet etching. The films were subsequently annealed in vacuum. The fatigue properties of the films were characterized by a self-developed <b>fatigue</b> <b>testing</b> <b>device</b> under tension-tension loading mode. Fatigue life diagrams were conducted and investigated at various testing variables such as different cyclic frequencies and different mean strains. In addition, the influences of the chemical composition, the film thickness, and the annealing conditions on the fatigue characteristics were investigated. The fatigue endurance limit (FEL) in this work was taken at 10 million cycles. A significantly improved FEL of more than 350 % was attained by using different surface finishing. The FEL in this work is the highest among all published literature data on NiTi films. Moreover, the biocompatibilities of NiTi films were examined by investigating the cell growth on films’ surface after different surface finishing. The result showed insignificant dependence of cell growth and adhesion on the film surface. The freestanding films showed a great biocompatibility levels. In addition, the measurements of the Ni ion release on NiTi films modified with the different surface finishing were performed in a balanced salt solution used to mimic human body fluids. The {{results show that the}} Ni concentration in the tested solution is below the maximum limit of the international biocombatibitly standards and that the Ni ion release can be modified through different surface finishings.

40|$|X-ray {{computed}} tomography (CT) is an established method in non-destructive testing / evaluation (NDT / NDE) applications. A {{wide range of}} CT systems is available to the market distinct mainly by resolution properties. The process X-ray tomography application requires for an adaption of the process device which in some cases can be mounted on the rotation stage of the standard CT apparatus. Most representative examples are compact <b>fatigue</b> <b>testing</b> <b>devices</b> providing multiaxial forces to the tensile specimen encapsulated in a mostly X-ray transparent housing. This procedure is usually applied to relatively small and isolated samples. For processes that cannot be measured in an isolated environment, due to their size or other boundaries application specific CT systems can be developed using a large variety of X-ray components available on the market. In this contribution the Fraunhofer Development Centre for X-ray Technology (EZRT) shows application specific solutions realized in the past years for process monitoring in material science and chemistry. One focus of the contribution is the CT of packed distillation columns applied for {{the investigation of the}} fluid dynamics and transportation processes in different packing systems at the Institute of Separation Science and Technology, University of Erlangen-Nürnberg. Fluid dynamic parameters in distillation columns (like interfacial area, liquid hold-up and liquid film thickness on the packing or between two liquid phases) can be directly estimated from the recorded CT images of a packing cross section at different height positions along the column in operation. A segmentation process allows for a quantitative evaluation of the fluid behaviour corresponding to the packaging. The CT system is adapted to scan a chromatography or distillation column in its vertical orientation using a horizontally rotating X-ray gantry setup allowing for gravity affected measurements relevant in e. g. low pressure fluid systems. The setup allows for versatile applications with a CT scan rate of 1 Hz at a maximum resolution down to 70 microns for objects between 50 and 200 mm. This technique replaces today the commonly applied medical CT for such kind of experiments. Another presented example for a process adapted CT setup provides an insight into the Physical Vapor Transport (PVT) process at 2200 °C allowing in-situ observation of the growth of SiC bulk crystals.
