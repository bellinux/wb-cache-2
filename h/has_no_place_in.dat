25|$|The first {{sentence}} of H.J. Res. 56 {{would provide an}} official definition of legal marriage in the United States. Proponents claim {{that this is a}} reasonable measure, based on established custom, which defends the family and the institution of marriage. To others, it is an unfair means of excluding same-sex couples from receiving benefits from that institution.

25|$|Spironolactone {{has been}} studied at a high dosage in the {{treatment}} of benign prostatic hyperplasia. It was found to be better than placebo in terms of symptom relief following three months of treatment. However, this was not maintained after six months of treatment, by which point the improvements had largely disappeared. Moreover, no difference was observed between spironolactone and placebo with regard to volume of residual urine or prostate size. Gynecomastia was observed in about 5% of people. On the basis of these results, {{it has been said that}} spironolactone <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.|$|E

25|$|The {{issue of}} school prayer remains {{contentious}} even where courts {{as diverse as}} those in Canada, the United States, Russia, and Poland attempt {{to strike a balance}} between religious and secular activity in state-sponsored arenas. Some arguments have held that religion in schools is both an effective sociomoral tool as well as a valuable means to psychological stability. On the opposing side, others have argued that prayer <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> a classroom where impressionable students are continually subject to influence by the majority. The latter kind of claim holds that, to the extent that a public school itself promotes the majority religion, the state is guilty of coercive interference in the lives of the individual.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, the Illinois Senator made {{headlines}} when she convinced the Senate Judiciary Committee not to renew a design patent for the United Daughters of the Confederacy because it contained the Confederate flag. The patent had been routinely renewed {{for nearly a}} century, and despite the Judiciary Committee’s disapproval, the Senate was poised to pass a resolution sponsored by Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina that included a provision to authorize {{the extension of the}} federal patent. Moseley Braun threatened to filibuster the legislation “until this room freezes over.” She also made a plea to her colleagues about the symbolism of the Confederate flag, declaring, “It <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> our modern times, place in this body, place in our society.” Swayed by Moseley Braun’s argument, the Senate rejected the UDC’s application to renew its patent.|$|E
25|$|The {{distinction}} between dependency- and constituency-based grammars derives {{in large part}} from the initial division of the clause. The constituency relation derives from an initial binary division, whereby the clause is split into a subject noun phrase (NP) and a predicate verb phrase (VP). This division is certainly present in the basic analysis of the clause that we find in the works of, for instance, Leonard Bloomfield and Noam Chomsky. Tesnière, however, argued vehemently against this binary division, preferring instead to position the verb as {{the root of all}} clause structure. Tesnière's stance was that the subject-predicate division stems from term logic and <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> linguistics. The importance of this distinction is that if one acknowledges the initial subject-predicate division in syntax as something real, then one is likely to go down the path of constituency grammar, whereas if one rejects this division, then the only alternative is to position the verb as the root of all structure, which means one has chosen the path of dependency grammar.|$|E

25|$|The Medinah Athletic Club {{building}} {{was intended to}} combine elements of many architectural styles. At the eighth floor, its Indiana limestone facade was decorated by three large relief carvings in ancient Assyrian style. Each frieze depicted a different scene {{in the order of}} constructing a building, with Contribution on the south wall, Wisdom represented on the west wall and Consecration on the north. (According to an article in the Chicago Tribune from Sept 16, 1928 entitled “Building art inspires panels”:“The friezes were designed by George Unger, in collaboration with Walter Ahlschlager, and carved by Léon Hermant. The figures are costumed in the period of the building, which is that of an old fortress in Mesopotamia in Xerxes time, about 5th century BC. The theme of the panels as explained by Mr. Unger, was inspired by the history of construction of any building. The south panel starts the story. Here a magnificent cortege is displayed. This panel, termed Contribution, signifies the getting together of treasures for the construction of the building. In the west panel, facing Michigan Avenue, a ruler is shown with his counselors and an architect is shown bringing in a model of the building planned. The north panel shows the consecration of the building after it has been built. A priest is sacrificing a white bull whose blood will be mixed with crushed grapes and poured into the earth. A monkey trainer and his animals are shown. Since the animals represented bigotry in the ancient drawings, they are shown here in leash as symbolic belief that bigotry <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the Masonic order.”) The figures in all three scenes are said to be modeled after the faces of club members {{at the time of its}} design. Three Sumerian warriors were also carved into the facade at the twelfth-floor setback, directly above the Michigan Avenue entrance, and remain visible today.|$|E

The Griffins then ultimately accept Brian back, while Stewie, traumatized by what happened to Rupert, frantically washes him in the shower while comforting him.|$|E

500|$|Dostoyevsky's Petersburg is {{the city}} of unrelieved poverty; [...] "magnificence <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> it, because magnificence is external, formal abstract, cold". Dostoyevsky connects the city's {{problems}} to Raskolnikov's thoughts and subsequent actions. The crowded streets and squares, the shabby houses and taverns, the noise and stench, all are transformed by Dostoyevsky into a rich store of metaphors for states of mind. Donald Fanger asserts that [...] "the real city ... rendered with a striking concreteness, is also a city of the mind {{in the way that}} its atmosphere answers Raskolnikov's state and almost symbolizes it. It is crowded, stifling, and parched." [...] The inner turmoil suffered by Raskolnikov can also be perceived as a Shakespearean pathetic fallacy. For example, the great storm in Shakespeare's King Lear reflects the state of the titular character's mind, much like the chaos, disorder and noise of St. Petersburg reflects the state of Raskolnikov's mind.|$|E
