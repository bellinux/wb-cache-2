5|$|Prabhu further {{asserts that}} Tipu's hatred of Christians was {{compounded}} by fears that as they shared the same faith as their European co-religionists, the Christians were viewed as a potential fifth column {{in the event of}} a British attack. To this, he adds that Tipu also had future territorial ambitions in Goa and wanted to rid himself of any potential dissent from the Christians within his domain. Therefore, according to Prabhu, through coerced confessions of prominent Mangalorean Catholics, Tipu fabricated evidence of a large-scale Christian conspiracy against him, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> it wasn't true.|$|E
5|$|Veronica {{talks to}} Sean Friedrich {{and tells him}} about the girl-on-girl event and that Dick and Beaver took her over to a bed and argued about who should have sex with her. Veronica talks to Dick, who {{presents}} a different account of events, saying that he didn't drug her and that he found Beaver with Veronica already. Veronica approaches Beaver, who gives a set of events more {{similar to that of}} Sean. However, after Dick and Sean leave, he purports to have run away and vomited before he could bring himself to rape her. Keith says that he has to leave for an engagement in Vegas. Logan talks to Aaron, but Aaron does not even know Logan's birth date. Veronica talks to Carrie Bishop (Leighton Meester), who says that she saw Veronica having sex with Duncan. Veronica confronts Duncan, who denies the rape accusations and remembers comforting Veronica in her drugged state. Duncan says that the sex was consensual <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> that they were siblings, confirming Veronica's fears. Veronica talks to Wallace about the events but says that she is content with the answers she has. Keith calls a prostitute in Vegas for an unknown reason, while Veronica apologizes to Logan and tells her about the situation with Duncan. Back in Vegas, Keith talks to the prostitute, Cheyenne, about Abel Koontz, as Cheyenne and Koontz were together at the time of Lilly's murder. Veronica and Logan go into his darkened house before they realize that Aaron throws a surprise party for him, meaning that virtually the entire high school knows that they are dating.|$|E
25|$|Archduke Charles {{disagreed}} with Mack's aggressive strategy. When Emperor Francis I asked his opinion, Charles wrote him that Mack {{was making a}} serious blunder by invading Bavaria. Nevertheless, the emperor allowed Mack to pursue his course of action. Fearing the worst in Bavaria, Charles took up a defensive posture, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> he outnumbered Masséna.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{the steady}} {{increase}} {{of support for}} the social democrats Bismarck tried to suppress the party and related associations more firmly. Two assassination attempts on Kaiser Wilhelm I in May and June 1878 gave him the opportunity to act. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> the contrary was true, he accused the SAP of commissioning the assassins.|$|E
25|$|The {{excitement}} and {{interest of the}} dying game now centred around the batting performance of Alan Knott. His last day survival {{was more than just}} occupation of the crease. Beginning the day without a run to his name, he consistently thumbed his nose at the Australian attack for over three hours, playing shots <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> that his ship was sinking under his very feet. It was a magnificent solo effort of defiance.|$|E
25|$|In August 1812 Laura was escorting convoys but on 8 September she {{encountered}} the French privateer brig Diligent, under Alexis Grassin, off the Delaware River. Laura had just captured three American prizes {{and was in}} the process of taking a fourth when Diligent arrived on the scene. Hunter recalled his boat and her men from the prize and sailed to engage, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> from his third prize that Diligent out-manned and outgunned Laura.|$|E

25|$|Jones was {{surprised}} when a Methodist superintendent helped him get a start in the church <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> Jones to be a communist and Jones did not meet him through the Communist Party USA. In 1952, he became a student pastor in Sommerset Southside Methodist Church, but claimed he left that church because its leaders barred him from integrating blacks into his congregation. Around this time, Jones witnessed a faith-healing service at a Seventh Day Baptist Church. He observed that it attracted people and their money and concluded that, with financial resources from such healings, he could help accomplish his social goals.|$|E
25|$|From 1911 until 1915, Curtin was {{employed}} as Secretary of the Timberworkers' Union, and during World War I {{he was a}} militant anti-conscriptionist; he was briefly imprisoned for refusing to attend a compulsory medical examination, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> he would fail the exam due to his very poor eyesight. He also at this time stood as the Labor candidate for Balaclava in 1914. The strain of this period led him to drink heavily and regularly, a vice which blighted his career for many years. In 1917, he married Elsie Needham, the sister of Labor Senator Ted Needham.|$|E
25|$|Ruault {{was soon}} {{reinforced}} to 25,000 men, a force considerably outnumbering the besiegers. By 3 October the Austrian bombardment began to noticeably taper off. On 3 October, the citizen captain Charlemagne Ovigneur continued {{to serve his}} gun <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> his house was burning and his wife {{was going to give}} birth. On 4 October, Saxe-Teschen's wife, Maria Christina, Duchess of Teschen appeared in the Austrian camp and the bombardment was redoubled. By this time, Saxe-Teschen became aware of Brunswick's retreat as well as the increasing numbers of French troops opposing him. On 6 October the Austrian commander directed that the heavy siege guns be removed from the batteries. By this time 60,000 shot and shell had been fired into Lille. The Austrians evacuated the trenches on 8 October and withdrew almost unmolested {{in the face of a}} weak pursuit led by Félix Marie Pierre Chesnon de Champmorin. The inhabitants of Lille emerged from their town and, in their rage at the destruction, leveled the Austrian siege works. The victory was celebrated throughout France and caused many men to enlist in the armies.|$|E

500|$|Wooden Leg {{describes}} {{the recovery of}} many objects from the dead soldiers, some of which the Indians did not understand, such as a compass and a pocketwatch. [...] He threw away paper money he found, not realising its value. He gave away coins <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> their value, {{because he had no}} wish to trade with white men. [...] When a new column of soldiers was observed approaching (the main force of infantry under Brigadier General Alfred Terry), the council of Chiefs decided not to continue the fight. [...] At this point the Indians disengaged and the entire camp packed up and relocated.|$|E
500|$|In August 2014, it was {{confirmed}} that producers had planned a romance storyline for Mark and his housemate Paige Smith (Olympia Valance). After growing closer, they realised {{that they had}} a deeper connection than friendship. They later agreed to go out for dinner, but neither of them called it a date. Mark struggled with the idea of moving on from Kate, and <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> it was a date, he had not admitted it out loud. Mark ignored Paige afterwards, causing her to confront him as a storm hit Erinsborough. Brennan and Paige then consummated their relationship. Their first official date ended abruptly when Paige turned up wearing an old dress of Kate's she found in a charity shop. Brennan reacted angrily and shouted at Paige to leave the bar. He later realised that he had been too harsh, but just as he decided to give their relationship another go, he saw her kissing another man. McGregor commented [...] "He thinks he's blown his chances with her – but he's also wondering if this is what he really wants." ...|$|E
500|$|Other than {{mentioning}} that {{he carried a}} pocket chronometer by French which gave good results, Stokes' account of the voyage does not list or even enumerate the chronometers. [...] It may be that chronometers were now so commonplace that their use was no longer something of note. [...] However it is quite clear that the chronometers remained {{a key part of}} the mission; frequent stops were made throughout the voyage to check the rates. On 7 December 1839 Stokes went ashore at Point Pearce near the mouth of Victoria River to make observations. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> the indigenous Australians could be dangerous, he left behind his gun to more safely carry a chronometer. [...] While separated, Stokes was pursued by a group of Australians, one of whom pierced Stokes' chest cavity with a spear throw. Despite his wounds and profuse bleeding, Stokes considered the chronometer to be valuable enough to save; he carried it while he staggered back to his comrades barely able to walk and still being pursued by his attackers.|$|E

Sctanley, after having lost the wager, directs them to Eden East, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> was tricked by Dave.|$|R
500|$|The next day, Eichelberger's {{party was}} flown to Dobodura, where he assumed command of US {{troops in the}} Buna area. He {{relieved}} Harding, and replaced him with the division's artillery commander, Brigadier General Albert W. Waldron. He relieved other officers too, appointing a 26-year-old captain to command a battalion. Some of the 32nd Infantry Division's officers privately denounced Eichelberger as ruthless and [...] "Prussian". He set an example by moving among the troops on the front lines, sharing their hardships and danger. Despite the risk, he purposefully wore his three silver stars while at the front, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> Japanese snipers targeted officers, because he wanted his troops to know their commander was present. After the snipers seriously wounded Waldron in the shoulder, Eichelberger appointed Byers to command the 32nd Infantry Division, but he too was wounded on 16 December. This left Eichelberger as the only American general in the forward area, and he assumed personal command of the division. He was not the most senior general present though; he served {{under the command of}} Australian, Lieutenant General Edmund Herring, whom he referred to in letters to Em as [...] "my grand colleague".|$|E
500|$|Although his {{appearance}} {{as a domestic}} pet is mostly a cover, Perry has nonetheless expressed care and devotion for the Flynn-Fletcher family. In the episode [...] "The Ballad of Bad Beard", Perry managed to drag Candace out of the Dark Cave before it caved in because of Dr. Doofenshmirthz's [...] "self destruction button" [...] that which Candace had accidentally pressed while under the orange moss hallucination, thinking it was a vending machine. He did this <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> that Candace saw that Perry was a secret agent talking to Agent E (Eagle) and to Major Monogram in a cracked egg. Candace thought she was just hallucinating because of the orange moss she accidentally touched earlier in the episode. Also, when an invention of Doofenshmirtz's in the episode [...] "Journey to the Center of Candace" [...] might cause severe harm to Phineas and Ferb, Perry thoroughly beats up Doofenshmirtz and quickly handcuffs him. He then ties him to a pipe and, instead of just leaving him like he usually does in the series, calls for special forces from the O.W.C.A. to come and arrest the doctor, though they never show up. In [...] "Oh, There You Are, Perry," [...] Doofenshmirtz is downgraded to a low threat level and Perry is reassigned to a new nemesis. This causes him {{to have to leave}} his home with the Flynn-Fletchers, which makes him sad and he does not enjoy his new villain. Phineas and Ferb are fearful about where Perry could have gone to and put up several flyers around town for people to find him. They decide to throw a concert on the roof of a building, singing a song about how much they love Perry and want him to come home. Concurrently, Perry is reassigned to Doofenshmirtz again and returns to the brothers once more.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the struggles}} with the strike, co-executive producer/staff writer Adam Horowitz recounted this as [...] "a {{satisfying}} episode to work on—it was like we'd been waiting so long {{to tell the story}} of what happened with Michael." [...] Carlton Cuse stated that [...] "we [...] felt that the audience deserved to know, you know, once he and Walt sailed off in the boat, what was their journey." [...] Supervising producer/writer Elizabeth Sarnoff stated that [...] "Michael's goal—the whole season—is to die and he gets an opportunity to redeem himself when [...] finds him." [...] Co-executive producer/staff writer Edward Kitsis added that [...] "It's heartbreaking when Walt wouldn't see [...] … I always respected the fact that he told his son about the murders … <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> it would probably blow up their relationship, he wanted to be honest with his son. In a way, you've got to respect that." [...] Harold Perrineau, who plays Michael, concluded that [...] "He's done some bad things and he's you know, got himself into a messy situation, but at the end of the day, Michael's a good guy." [...] Instead of being intercut with scenes from the main ongoing plot, the flashbacks of [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] are presented continuously and are only bookended by present-day scenes. This is the second episode to do this after [...] "Flashes Before Your Eyes" [...] from the third season. The flashback portion of [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] is the longest in Lost history; Horowitz stated that [...] "As we were breaking the story, it just happened, and it turned into the longest flashback to date." [...] When asked why Michael's alias was not an allusion to a literary or historical figure, as with other Lost characters, Damon Lindelof explained that [...] "if the Others … had chosen … Darwin or … Dickens, then … Widmore would have gotten suspicious: he'd go like, 'oh, now there's somebody on my boat with a literary allusion in their name, which sounds very much like that's a Benjamin Linus alias', so they picked the most innocuous name they possibly could, which was Kevin Johnson." [...] Lindelof also said that it was a coincidence that [...] "Kevin Johnson" [...] was also the name of an American basketball player.|$|E

50|$|An {{example of}} paternalistic {{deception}} {{would be a}} doctor telling a mother that her daughter is doing well, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> that {{she is going to}} die. The doctor acted paternalistically to spare the mother's feelings without attempting to control her behavior or liberty of action.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{pressure}} from his desperate community, Wannihami still retains clarity of vision which transcends his blindness. He decides {{to dig up}} his son’s sealed coffin, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> it will invalidate the compensation claim. His greater purpose is {{to believe that the}} war cannot kill his son.|$|R
2500|$|Ben Kuchera of Polygon {{wrote that}} Cuphead {{was one of}} the five most {{interesting}} reveals at Microsoft's E3 2014 press conference, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> little about the game apart from its aesthetic.

2500|$|Goodloe came to Meadville <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> it was {{unlikely}} he would be ordained by a Unitarian church, because none would accept a black minister.
