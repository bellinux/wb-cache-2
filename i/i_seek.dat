25|$|May you, O Revered One! Voluntarily permit me. I {{would like}} to confess my sinful acts {{committed}} while walking. I honour your permission. I desire to absolve myself of the sinful acts by confessing them. <b>I</b> <b>seek</b> forgiveness from all those living beings which I may have tortured while walking, coming and going, treading on living organism, seeds, green grass, dew drops, ant hills, moss, live water, live earth, spider web and others. <b>I</b> <b>seek</b> forgiveness from all these living beings, be they — one sensed, two sensed, three sensed, four sensed or five sensed. Which I may have kicked, covered with dust, rubbed with ground, collided with other, turned upside down, tormented, frightened, shifted {{from one place to}} another or killed and deprived them of their lives. (By confessing) may I be absolved of all these sins.|$|E

500|$|This is my problem. I've had {{signs of}} it {{for a very long}} time. It's caused {{problems}} within my family. I thought a career in the military would get rid of it.

But, it's not going away; it's haunting me more and more as I get older. Now, the consequences of it are dire, at a time when it's causing me great pain in itself ...|$|E
500|$|Hitchens first {{referred}} to The Rage Against God in August 2009, {{in one of}} his weekly columns: [...] "Above all, <b>I</b> <b>seek</b> to counter the assertion, central to my brother's case ... that the Soviet regime was in fact religious in character. This profound misunderstanding {{of the nature of the}} USSR is the key to finding another significant flaw in what is in general his circular argument". Then, a week before the book's publication, Hitchens wrote: [...] "...it is obvious much of what I say [...] arises out of my attempt to debate religion with him , it would be absurd to pretend that much of what I say here is not intended to counter or undermine arguments he presented in his book, God Is Not Great...".|$|E
500|$|On May 22, 1856 Preston Brooks brutally {{assaulted}} Senator Charles Sumner on the Senate floor, leaving Sumner {{bloody and}} unconscious. Brooks had been upset over Sumner's Crimes Against Kansas speech that denounced the Kansas-Nebraska Act. [...] After the beating, Sumner received medical {{treatment at the}} Capitol, following which Wilson and Nathaniel P. Banks, the Speaker of the House, aided Sumner to travel by carriage to his lodgings, where he received further medical attention. [...] Wilson called the beating by Brooks [...] "brutal, murderous, and cowardly". Brooks immediately challenged Wilson to a duel. Wilson declined, saying {{that he could not}} legally or by personal conviction participate. In reference to a rumor that Brooks might attack Wilson in the Senate as he had attacked Sumner, Wilson told the press [...] "I have sought no controversy, and <b>I</b> <b>seek</b> none, but I shall go where duty requires, uninfluenced by threats of any kind." [...] The rumors proved unfounded, and Wilson continued his Senate duties without incident.|$|E

500|$|Scogin's introspective lyrics {{have covered}} topics like materialism, death, and the Nashville Christian music industry. The lyrics for Wars and Rumors of Wars were formed after a family loss: [...] "...only {{a year ago}} my father passed away. And I hate to say this, because it sounds like such a band-dude thing to say, but the lyrics are a lot darker than any other record just because of how {{personal}} they are for me." [...] Scogin usually refers to his lyrics as poems and has maintained that [...] "a song is never finished but abandoned." [...] "...as an artist you can forever be changing a song or making a song 'better' or whatever but the moment that you stop recording and send it off to be mastered you have not 'finished' the song…you have only abandoned the song {{and that is how}} it will stay forever." [...] His lyrics sometimes espouse Christian themes and beliefs, albeit subtly. For example, the track [...] "Yellow Dress: Locked Knees" [...] from Everything... contains the Spanish lyrics [...] "Jesus, yo quiero que este mundo te conozca."; when translated, it says [...] "Jesus, I want this world to know You." [...] The song [...] "And Shot Each Other" [...] from The Fiancée fades out into a Sacred Harp choir singing the song 'Child of Grace', which features the lyrics [...] "How happy is a child of grace, who feels his sins forgiven / This world, he cries, is not my place / <b>I</b> <b>seek</b> a place in Heaven." ...|$|E

60|$|There {{were times}} when I could have wished the world a world all of men, so greatly did this unassimilated series of motives and curiosities hamper me; and times when I could have wished the world all of women. I seemed always to be seeking {{something}} in women, in girls, and I was never clear what it was <b>I</b> was <b>seeking.</b> But never--even at my coarsest--was I moved by physical desire alone. Was <b>I</b> <b>seeking</b> help and fellowship? Was <b>I</b> <b>seeking</b> some intimacy with beauty? It was a thing too formless to state, that I seemed always desiring to attain and never attaining. Waves of gross sensuousness arose out of this preoccupation, carried me to a crisis of gratification or disappointment that was clearly not the needed thing; they passed and left my mind free again for a time {{to get on with}} the permanent pursuits of my life. And then presently this solicitude would have me again, an irrelevance as it seemed, and yet a constantly recurring demand.|$|R

[...] The expression [...] "rest", or [...] "resting-place", though in itself of generic import, was, when used in such circumstances as environed Ruth, quite specific in application, and would be at once understood. It was a [...] "home" [...] to which Naomi pointed, a home for her daughter's heart. In such a home, if warm and pure, there would be repose for the affections.|$|E

2500|$|By 1908, {{newspapers}} {{as serious}} as The Times used it, although with careful explanation: [...] "A 'flapper', we may explain, is a young lady who {{has not yet been}} promoted to long frocks and the wearing of her hair 'up'". In April 1908, the fashion section of London's The Globe and Traveler contained a sketch entitled [...] "The Dress of the Young Girl" [...] with the following explanation: Americans, and those fortunate English folk whose money and status permit them to go in freely for slang terms ... call the subject of these lines the 'flapper.' The appropriateness of this term does not move me to such whole-hearted admiration of the amazing powers of enriching our language which the Americans modestly acknowledge they possess ..., [...] in fact, would scarcely merit the honour of a moment of my attention, but for the fact that <b>I</b> <b>seek</b> in vain for any other expression that is understood to signify that important young person, the maiden of some sixteen years.

2500|$|The {{following}} year, {{the parents}} of Seattle University president Stephen Sundborg (and former 26-year residents of Alaska) George and Mary Sundborg donated $1million to the Seattle University School of Law Alaska Fund, a scholarship for Alaskan law students. Addressing the donation, to a school [...] southeast of Alaska, the president noted that Alaska was the only state without a law school: [...] "As an Alaskan myself, <b>I</b> <b>seek</b> as president of Seattle University to develop this educational service to Alaska in many ways. It was because of this commitment {{and in order to}} begin this broader initiative that I asked my own parents for the initial gift to the Alaska Fund." [...] The elder Sundborg (one of the 55 signers of the Alaska State Constitution, a copy of which was displayed at Seattle University {{at the time of the}} donation) was an editor of newspapers in Juneau and Fairbanks, general manager of the Alaska Development Board and assistant to Governor and United States Senator Ernest Gruening. That year, Seattle University devoted a school-library room to Alaskan law [...] "to better serve the legal community in Alaska" [...] and bid (unsuccessfully) to publish the Alaska Law Review.|$|E
