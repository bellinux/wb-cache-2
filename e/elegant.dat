5|$|A revival by Frederic Goudy for the American {{branch of}} Monotype, the name chosen to differ from other revivals. An <b>elegant</b> sample created by Bruce Rogers {{was shown in}} a spring 1923 issue of Monotype's magazine. It like Monotype Garamond {{features}} a large range of swash characters, based on Imprimerie Nationale specimen sheets.|$|E

She was considered the most beautiful of the four grand duchesses by many courtiers. Of all her sisters, Tatiana most closely resembled their mother.|$|E

5|$|The {{workmanship}} {{of early}} Ichimonji smiths such as Norimune {{resembles that of}} the Ko-Bizen school: tachi have a narrow mihaba, deep koshi-zori, funbari and an <b>elegant</b> sugata with small kissaki. The hamon is small midare or small midare with small chōji midare in small nie.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the middle}} of the film we show the Purim festival, a victory festival which the Jews {{celebrate}} as a festival of revenge on the Goyim, the Christians. Here I am depicting authentic Jewry as it was then and as it now continues unchecked in Poland. In contrast to this original Jewry, we are presented with Süss, the <b>elegant</b> financial adviser to the Court, the clever politician in short, the Jew in disguise.|$|E
5|$|Art Salsberg {{became the}} editor of Popular Electronics in 1974 with a goal of {{reclaiming}} the lead in projects. He wanted to publish a computer project that was more functional and <b>elegant</b> than the Mark-8. Les Solomon knew MITS was working on an Intel 8080 based computer project and thought Roberts could provide the project for the always popular January issue.|$|E
5|$|Borobudur is {{constructed}} {{in such a}} way that it reveals various levels of terraces, showing intricate architecture that goes from being heavily ornamented with bas-reliefs to being plain in Arupadhatu circular terraces. The first four terrace walls are showcases for bas-relief sculptures. These are exquisite, considered to be the most <b>elegant</b> and graceful in the ancient Buddhist world.|$|E
5|$|Designed by Arnold Wolf from {{a concept}} {{elaborated}} by Richard Ranger, {{it is almost}} nine feet long and requires over a hundred-man hours of hand-finishing {{by a team of}} dedicated craftsmen. Resembling less a conventional loudspeaker than an <b>elegant</b> sideboard, it is a landmark product for the company that was sought after by the well-heeled and celebrities. With an estimated total production of about 1,000 units, it is highly sought after by collectors to this day.|$|E
5|$|He {{received}} {{the education of}} a young man of the privileged senatorial class, studying rhetoric and literature. In his biography in the Lives of the Twelve Caesars, Suetonius attests to Domitian's ability to quote the important poets and writers such as Homer or Virgil on appropriate occasions, and describes him as a learned and educated adolescent, with <b>elegant</b> conversation. Among his first published works were poetry, as well as writings on law and administration.|$|E
5|$|He {{was not an}} <b>elegant</b> exponent. His normal {{language}} is flat and monotonous. But uneven, and significantly so. For this author is erudite, a fancier of words, and a collector. Hence many rarities, or even inventions... first, when depicting the measures of a military disciplinarian, he brings in technical terms redolent of the camp. Second, archaism, preciosity, and flowery words.|$|E
5|$|Her {{childhood}} was spent at her father's homes, including Pavlovsk Palace and estates in the Crimea. Her {{father was a}} younger brother of Alexander II, and her mother {{was considered one of}} the most intelligent and <b>elegant</b> women of the court. Olga was particularly close to her older brother, Nicholas, and was one of the few members of the imperial family to keep in touch with him after he was banished to Tashkent.|$|E
5|$|Imelda was {{expected}} to be sophisticated, <b>elegant,</b> and well versed by her husband. Marcos knew that having a supportive wife, a trophy that he could be proud of, would gain him more supporters as well as votes. Imelda began dressing herself with expensive clothes and made every effort to become the person whom her husband wanted her to be.|$|E
5|$|In 1790, the Swedish Academy awarded Bellman {{its annual}} Lundblad prize of 50 Riksdaler {{for the most}} {{interesting}} piece of literature of the year. Although Fredman's Epistles was neither exactly literature as understood by the academy, nor meeting the standards of <b>elegant</b> taste, Johan Henric Kellgren and the King ensured that Bellman won the prize.|$|E
5|$|In June 1913, the Entwurf ("draft") {{theory was}} the result of these investigations. As its name suggests, it was a sketch of a theory, less <b>elegant</b> and more {{difficult}} than general relativity, with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions. After more than two years of intensive work, Einstein realized that the hole argument was mistaken and abandoned the theory in November 1915.|$|E
5|$|In the {{electromagnetic}} process, {{a magnetic field}} deflected charged particles according to mass. The process was neither scientifically <b>elegant</b> nor industrially efficient. Compared with a gaseous diffusion plant or a nuclear reactor, an electromagnetic separation plant would consume more scarce materials, require more manpower to operate, and cost more to build. Nonetheless, the process was approved because {{it was based on}} proven technology and therefore represented less risk. Moreover, it could be built in stages, and would rapidly reach industrial capacity.|$|E
5|$|Isola was the {{youngest}} of three daughters of Mauno and Toini Isola. Mauno was a farmer who wrote song lyrics including a popular Finnish Christmas carol. The girls lived on the family farm and helped out with agricultural work in the summer. They made paper dolls with <b>elegant</b> dresses for their homemade paper dollshouse, which had elaborately decorated interiors.|$|E
5|$|Lecter takes Starling to Krendler's secluded lake {{house and}} treats her wounds. When Krendler arrives for the Fourth of July, Lecter subdues and drugs him. Starling, disoriented by {{morphine}} {{and dressed in}} a black velvet evening gown, awakens to find Krendler seated at the table set for an <b>elegant</b> dinner. Weakened by the drugs, she looks on in horror as Lecter removes part of Krendler's prefrontal cortex, sautés it, and feeds it to him.|$|E
5|$|Norway's {{architectural}} {{trends are}} also seen to parallel political and societal changes in Norway over the centuries. Prior to the Viking Age, wooden structures {{developed into a}} sophisticated craft evident in the <b>elegant</b> and effective construction of the Viking longships. Following that, the ascent of Christianity introduced Romanesque architecture in cathedrals and churches, with characteristically slightly pointed arches, barrel vaults, cruciform piers supporting vaults, and groin vaults; in large part {{as a result of}} religious influence from England.|$|E
5|$|Rani Mukerji as Tina Malhotra: The principal's daughter, {{who is a}} {{transfer}} student from Oxford University. She is <b>elegant</b> and sophisticated and described as the most beautiful girl in college. She {{falls in love with}} Rahul and marries him, having a daughter with him, but has always felt guilty for coming between Anjali and Rahul. She passes away after giving birth, and her last wish is for Rahul to name their child Anjali.|$|E
5|$|Several further would-be suitors {{visited the}} Skinkers, but all were repulsed by Tannakin's face and she {{remained}} unmarried. Despairing {{of finding a}} suitable husband in Wirkham, the Skinker family moved to London, and took up residence in either Blackfriars or Covent Garden. (The anonymous author of A Certaine Relation says that the family {{did not wish to}} divulge their address, to discourage curiosity-seekers from gathering.) Many who met her were taken by her <b>elegant</b> dress and excellent demeanour.|$|E
5|$|Textiles {{from the}} most {{utilitarian}} to the most luxurious are made from animal fibres such as wool, camel hair, angora, cashmere, and mohair. Hunter-gatherers have used animal sinews as lashings and bindings. Leather from cattle, pigs and other species is widely used to make shoes, handbags, belts and many other items. Animals have been hunted and farmed for their fur, to make items such as coats and hats, again ranging from simply warm and practical to the most <b>elegant</b> and expensive.|$|E
5|$|The Christ Church {{scriptorium}} {{was particularly}} active under Wulfred. Although the handwriting {{of the documents}} produced during Wulfred's archiepiscopate is quite <b>elegant,</b> the actual contents of the charters is marked by bad grammar and other errors. From this, the historian N. P. Brooks has deduced that the clergy of the cathedral were not very literate in Latin, and would have likely been unable to compose new Latin works.|$|E
5|$|The Mercury Prize {{also has}} a {{reputation}} for being awarded to outside chances rather than the favourites. The 1994 award winner was <b>Elegant</b> Slumming by the pop act M People, which some felt was a controversial decision considering the shortlist included popular albums from Britpop figureheads Paul Weller, Blur and Pulp, and electronica band The Prodigy.|$|E
5|$|The book, {{published}} in February 2005 by Jonathan Cape in the United Kingdom and in April in the United States, was critically and commercially successful. Critics noted McEwan's <b>elegant</b> prose, careful dissection of daily life, and interwoven themes. It won the 2005 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction. It has {{been translated into}} eight languages.|$|E

The second floor was mainly designed to be used as the private living quarters of the Weddells and their staff and featured a large library, which now functions as the boardroom and research facility of the Virginia Historical Society.|$|E
5|$|The jacamars {{are near}} {{passerine}} birds from tropical South America {{with a range}} that extends up to Mexico. They feed on insects caught on the wing, and are glossy, <b>elegant</b> birds with long bills and tails. In appearance and behavior they resemble the Old World bee-eaters, although they are {{more closely related to}} puffbirds.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} purpose {{of much of}} Bath's architecture is concealed by the honey-coloured classical façades; in an era {{before the advent of}} the luxury hotel, these apparently <b>elegant</b> residences were frequently purpose-built lodging houses, where visitors could hire a room, a floor, or (according to their means) an entire house for the duration of their visit, and be waited on by the house's communal servants.|$|E
