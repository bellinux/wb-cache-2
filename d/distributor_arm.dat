2500|$|Barris, by {{this time}} living in France, came back again in 1984 and formed Barris Industries. He formed a <b>distributor</b> <b>arm</b> called Bel-Air Program Sales (later Barris Program Sales) and an ad-sales barter called Clarion Communications (later Barris Advertising Sales). After a week-long trial of The Newlywed Game on ABC in 1984 (with Dating Game emcee Jim Lange), Barris {{produced}} the daily Newlywed Game (titled The New Newlywed Game) in syndication from 1985 to 1989, with original host Eubanks (and in 1988, comedian Paul Rodriguez). The Dating Game returned to syndication the next year for a three-year run (the first year hosted by Elaine Joyce, and the next two hosted by Jeff MacGregor). The Gong Show would also return for one season in 1988, now hosted by [...] "True" [...] Don Bleu. All of those shows (except for the one-week trial run of Newlywed on ABC) aired in syndication, not on the networks.|$|E
2500|$|When a pin rolls back, {{the smaller}} {{diameter}} of the pin allows it to fall rearwards through the ball return wheel. As the pins are still moving from the shaking by the board, a pin will bounce around until it lands in a pocket in the pinwheel. It may be seated in the pinwheel head-first or base-first. [...] The wheel brings the pin {{to the top and}} drops it into a metal tray, called a [...] "turnaround pan", similar to what exists on the rear end of the AMF 82-30 unit's pin <b>distributor</b> <b>arm.</b> It's shaped somewhat like a scoop, with the lip of the scoop facing the bowler. The weight of the pin's body makes it drop into the pan base-first, so that the pin's base is facing the bowler. From there a conveyor belt lifts the pin up, letting it slide into one of ten spots – nine around the periphery in groups of three spots each, and one in the center for the number-5 pin – in a rotating metal basket called the [...] "turret" [...] (located just above the deck) with only the deck itself, protected with the attached sheet metal [...] "deck shield", visible to the bowler as it descends to handle the pins. When a pin lands in an empty location in the turret, the turret rotates (or [...] "indexes") so that the next pin will land in the next empty location, with the 5-pin chute {{in the center of the}} turret being filled last. Once the turret is full, and the empty deck reaches the top of its travel, all ten pins are simultaneously dropped from the turret into the spotting chutes of the table, which lowers them onto the lane to set the new rack of pins on the pin deck.|$|E

50|$|On December 21, 1987, Coca-Cola {{spun off}} their {{entertainment}} holdings {{and sold it}} to Tri-Star Pictures, Inc. for $3.1 billion. Tri-Star was renamed as Columbia Pictures Entertainment (which they partially owned) after the film Ishtar {{turned out to be}} a notorious failure. In January 1988, Columbia/Embassy Television and Tri-Star Television were formed to create the new Columbia Pictures Television and Embassy Communications was renamed to ELP Communications. Meanwhile, Colex Enterprises, Coca-Cola Telecommunications, and Embassy Communications (the <b>distributor</b> <b>arm)</b> were merged into the new Columbia Pictures Television Distribution. All shows in the era ended with the Columbia logo between 1988 and 1991. On February 2, 1988, Barry Thurston; vice-president of Columbia/Embassy Television, became president of Columbia Pictures Television Distribution.|$|E

40|$|The {{continuous}} filter {{is a kind}} of sand filter, {{which will}} operate without any interruptions for backwashing and also it accepts high-suspended solid levels in feed stream. Fouled sand is continuously removed from the filter bed, washed and recycled back without interruption with filtration process. Various samples of water with certain amounts of turbidity enter through a feed pipe and being distributed to the filter. A central column runs from top to bottom of the filter. The water is led through an outer tube in the column by a set of radial, <b>distributor</b> <b>arms.</b> The polluted water flows up ward through the sand bed. The water emerges; clean, in the top section of the tank, and eventually spills over a weir, and then inters into a discharge pipe. In this research, the continuous sand filter was studied to determine its disinfection efficiency in addition to turbidity removal. The results showed that the filtered water had a high quality and the turbidity reduction was 95. 5 %. Inspecting the work of the filter had revealed that the removal rates of coliforms and microbial colonies were 99. 67 % and 98. 99 % respectively. On the other hand, by the use of direct filtration, turbidity reduction was over 97 %. In direct filtration, drinking water with less than 1 NTU turbidity was provided. This continuous sand filter has the advantage of stable operation and more energy saving as compared to the conventional ones...|$|R

500|$|The tank {{broke down}} twice. The <b>distributor's</b> rotor <b>arm</b> broke and a {{replacement}} {{had to be}} sourced from Madrid. Then two of the device's valves used to cool the oil exploded, due to solder melting and mixing with the oil. It was very hot in the tank, despite the installation of ten fans, {{and the lack of}} suspension meant the driver was unable to stop shaking during filming breaks. The tank only moved at , which Vic Armstrong said made it difficult to film Indiana riding a horse against the tank while making it appear faster. A smaller section of the tank's top made from aluminum and which used rubber tracks was used for close-ups. It was built from a searchlight trailer, weighed eight tons, and was towed by a four-wheel drive truck. It had safety nets on each end to prevent injury to those falling off. A quarter-scale model by Gibbs was driven over a [...] cliff on location; Industrial Light & Magic created further shots of the tank's destruction with models and miniatures.|$|R
