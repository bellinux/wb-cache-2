5|$|In his 1935 book, The Three Americas, Widney {{said that}} Atlantis {{was in the}} area where the Bahamas are located. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a semi-tropical island, {{inhabited}} by peoples from the Americas rather than from Europe. He also believed that there was a submerged lost continent in the South Pacific Ocean.|$|E
5|$|It is poetic {{justice that}} a {{helicopter}} {{is now at}} the heart of the Government's embarrassment and in the centre of their dilemma. Indeed, it was hard to blame the prison officer who observed that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the Minister for Defence paying an informal visit to Mountjoy Prison yesterday because, of course, we all know the Minister for Defence is wont to use helicopters, as somebody observed already, as other Ministers are wont to use State cars.|$|E
5|$|Keyser and de Houtman {{assigned}} {{twelve stars}} to the constellation. Bayer depicted Grus on his chart, {{but did not}} assign its stars Bayer designations. French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille labelled them Alpha to Phi in 1756 with some omissions. In 1879, American astronomer Benjamin Gould added Kappa, Nu, Omicron and Xi, which had all been catalogued by Lacaille but not given Bayer designations. Lacaille considered them too faint, while Gould thought otherwise. Xi Gruis had originally been placed in Microscopium. Conversely, Gould dropped Lacaille's Sigma as <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> too dim.|$|E

5|$|Before Live and Let Die {{had been}} published, the {{producer}} Alexander Korda had read a proof {{copy of the}} novel. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the most exciting story he had read for years, but was unsure whether it was suitable for a film. Nevertheless, {{he wanted to show}} the story to the directors David Lean and Carol Reed for their impressions, although nothing came of Korda's initial interest. In 1955, following the television broadcast of an adaptation of Fleming's earlier novel Casino Royale, Warner Bros. expressed an interest in Live and Let Die, and offered $500 for an option, against $5,000 if the film was made. Fleming thought the terms insufficient and turned them down.|$|E
5|$|In early March 1704 Beatrix Laing {{approached}} Patrick Morton, a 16-year-old {{working in}} his father's smithy, {{to ask if he}} would make her some nails. Morton refused as he was already assigned an urgent task making nails for a merchant's ship in the harbour. Displeased, Laing left threatening revenge on him. The following day Morton noticed a bucket filled with water and burning coal outside Laing's house; <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> there to cast a spell on him. Laing had a reputation as a witch having already appeared before the Kirk session in 1696 for charming. Morton immediately felt weak and had difficulty standing or walking. His health deteriorated; he began to have fits and convulsions, his stomach became distended and his body was rigid and twisted. People claimed they could see marks left on his skin by fingernails where Morton said he had been pinched. He refused food and his breathing was laboured.|$|E

5000|$|Of the {{authenticity}} of 127 Hours, Ralston {{has said that the}} film is [...] "so factually accurate <b>it</b> <b>is</b> as close to a documentary as you can get and still be a drama," [...] and he jokingly added that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> [...] "the best film ever made." ...|$|R
60|$|The troubled Grace {{took the}} letter to her father, who now {{continued}} for long hours by the fireless summer chimney-corner, as if <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> winter, the pitcher of cider standing beside him, mostly untasted, and coated with a film of dust. After reading it he looked up.|$|R

25|$|Roca {{followed}} Nicolás Avellaneda as president. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{imperative to}} conquer the territory south of the Negro River as soon as possible, and ordered the 1881 campaign {{under the control of}} Colonel Conrado Villegas.|$|E
25|$|Captain Lee, on Elwood, {{said to a}} {{reporter}} on November 1 {{that he could see}} the light on the car, and from the sound, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> moving fast across the bridge, and the motorman might not realize that the draw was open.|$|E

25|$|Houhora Mountain was {{the first}} part of New Zealand that the early {{explorer}} Kupe saw, but <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a whale, according to Māori legend. Houhora was a Māori base settlement in the early 14th century. Snapper, seals, dolphins, moa and other birds were food sources.|$|E
25|$|Howard {{accepted}} {{no personal}} {{blame for the}} fiasco at Chancellorsville, and in his autobiography suggests that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> entirely his corps's fault for running, not his. McLean, coincidentally, would be ordered west May 18. He was given a desk job, provost marshal general. under Burnside in the Department of the Ohio.|$|E
25|$|Chris Green soon {{obtained}} {{his first}} 'place' on leaving home with Lord Berners but, {{according to his}} obituary writer, when <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> he that was entitled to the mount (and not George Edwards, the nominated jockey) of Phosphorus, the eventual but unfancied winner of the 1837 Derby, he threw up his engagement.|$|E

25|$|Judges Dieter Bohlen and Heinz Henn {{had started}} a quarrel with each other during the show. On April 14's show Henn {{made it clear that}} he did not agree with {{contestant}} Mark Medlock's song choices. Bohlen, the staunch supporter of Medlock, began imitating Henn during his review of Lisa Bund's performance. Henn later stated that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> “in bad taste, in bad style and disrespectful towards the contestants”.|$|E
25|$|Pile disliked {{school and}} thus {{received}} little education. He {{was put to}} work very young. His character was more practical than theoretical, trusting more to their eye than the plan. He constantly watched {{the progress of the}} ships he had built, corresponding with their captains. His custom was to seek information where <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to be got, and to get it he used periodically to visit the largest ports of the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> me {{at first}} and chatted away quite happily to Dave, whose French was near enough non-existent. Well, {{it was not long}} before he sensed {{something}} was wrong and whipped the scarf off the poor lad's face. He stormed over to my cabin and dragged me out, half asleep, on to the track. That was that! He and the other officials kept their eyes on us after that and we had little chance of getting away with any more larks like that.|$|E

25|$|In 1925, Lou Dubois of Kingston, {{across the}} Hudson River from Red Hook, bought a popular Silk City Diner from the Paterson Vehicle Company, {{one of the}} leading diner manufacturers. He chose to install it first in an area along {{recently}} designated Route 9, the Albany Post Road, just north of nearby Rhinebeck called Astor Flats. They called it the Halfway Diner because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> about halfway along Route 9 between New York City and Albany. Dubois's wife managed the diner while her husband continued to drive trucks for a beer distributor.|$|E
25|$|On 4 April 2011, a fire {{broke out}} on a Di 8 {{locomotive}} at Kløfta on the Trunk Line while hauling a 16-wagon train of jet fuel to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. The fire started in an electrical cabinet after a diesel pipe running over it had cracked. The fire fighting was complicated by the train dispatcher not wanting to disconnect the overhead wire power as <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an electric train. The damages were so severe that the locomotive was scrapped. The Accident Investigation Board Norway criticized CargoNet for not having sufficient maintenance routines for diesel pipes, as they were neither part of the maintenance procedure nor where there specified intervals for replacement.|$|E
25|$|Laurents {{was horrified}} {{when he saw}} the first rough cut of the film. He thought there were a few good scenes, and some good moments in bad scenes, but overall <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a badly photographed jumbled mess lacking coherence. Both stars {{appeared}} to be playing themselves more often than their characters, and Streisand often used a grand accent that Laurents felt hurt her performance. Pollack admitted the film was not good, accepted full responsibility for its problems, and apologized for his behavior. The following day he retreated to the editing room to improve it as much as possible. Laurents felt the changes made it better but never as good as it could have been.|$|E
