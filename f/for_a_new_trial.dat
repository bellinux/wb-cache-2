5|$|The {{trials were}} delayed {{due to the}} {{difficulties}} in bringing together witnesses, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and interpreters. The proceedings finally began in August 1828, with Judge James Duane Doty presiding. Wau-koo-kau and Man-ne-tah-peh-keh, the two warriors imprisoned for the 1826 murders of the Methode family, were released {{due to a lack}} of witnesses, as were three Ho-Chunks held for the attack on the keelboats. Only two men, Wekau and Chickhonsic, were prosecuted. According to historian Patrick Jung, it became clear during the trial that Red Bird had committed the murders at the Gagnier cabin, and that there was not enough evidence to convict Wekau and Chickhonsic. Despite this, the white and métis jury found them guilty. Judge Doty sentenced them to hang, as he was required to do by law. Their lawyer filed a motion <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>trial,</b> arguing that the jury had ignored the evidence, and so Doty suspended the death sentences.|$|E
5|$|Upon her {{arrest on}} November 22, 1995, Green {{was charged with}} two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of {{attempted}} first-degree murder, and one count of aggravated arson.

However, when the defense's own investigators verified the strength of forensic evidence against Green, she agreed to an Alford plea to all charges. On May 30, 1996, she was sentenced to two concurrent forty-year prison sentences. Green has petitioned <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>trial</b> twice since her conviction.

40|$|For {{patients}} with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), remission {{can be achieved}} with tight control of inflammation and early use of disease modifying agents. The importance of remission as an outcome has been recently highlighted by European League Against Rheumatism recommendations. However, remission when defined by clinical remission criteria (disease activity score, simplified disease activity index, etc) does not always equate to the complete absence of inflammation as measured by new sensitive imaging techniques such as ultrasound (US). There is evidence that imaging synovitis is frequently found in these patients and associated with adverse clinical and functional outcomes. This article reviews the data regarding remission, ultrasound imaging and outcomes in {{patients with}} RA to provide the background to a consensus statement from an international collaboration of ultrasonographers and rheumatologists who have recently formed a research network - the Targeted Ultrasound Initiative (TUI) group. The statement proposes that targeting therapy to PD activity provides superior outcomes compared with treating to clinical targets alone and introduces the rationale <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> randomised <b>trial</b> using targeted ultrasound in RA...|$|R

40|$|Speakers tend {{to design}} their utterances {{specifically}} for respective audiences (AD). The knowledge that a referential concept is shared {{with a particular}} listener allows the speaker to make, otherwise ambiguous, abbreviated and definite reference. Following conflicting evidence regarding the onset of competent listener-specific design, the current paper aims to experimentally expose the natural capacity for AD at 6 - 7 years. Thirty-one children (M age = 6; 8) performed a referential communication task describing {{the order of the}} same set of 4 tangram and 4 picture cards to an experimenter who became familiar over Trials 1 - 3, to <b>a</b> <b>new</b> experimenter in <b>Trial</b> 4, and again to the original partner in Trial 5. Referential descriptions were coded for 3 measures of AD – mean number of words used, hedging, and whether they were definitely or indefinitely determined. Participants showed exemplary patterns of AD in their fluctuating length of tangram descriptions. References were significantly shortened for the familiar listener (Trial 1 to 2); significantly lengthened <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> listener (<b>Trial</b> 3 to 4); and then significantly shortened again on reunion (Trial 4 to 5). The shortening <b>for</b> <b>a</b> familiar partner shows successful entrainment of nomenclature whilst lengthening shows application of the Listener Rule. Similarly, participants only made definite references with a familiar partner. A null result of familiarity on tentative hedging and indefinite determining of references is thought to be a methodological artefact rather than theoretical shortcoming. It is concluded that 6 - 7 year olds do show competence of AD, refuting the classic Piagetian position. With wider spread testing and methodological refinement, insight could be gained to the underlying mechanisms of AD...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The common frequentist {{approach}} {{is limited in}} providing investigators with appropriate measures <b>for</b> conducting <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>trial.</b> To answer such important questions and one {{has to look at}} Bayesian statistics. Methods As a worked example, we conducted a Bayesian cumulative meta-analysis to summarize the benefit of patient-specific instrumentation on the alignment of total knee replacement from previously published evidence. Data were sourced from Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases. All randomised controlled comparisons of the effect of patient-specific instrumentation on the coronal alignment of total knee replacement were included. The main outcome was the risk difference measured by the proportion of failures in the control group minus the proportion of failures in the experimental group. Through Bayesian statistics, we estimated cumulatively over publication time of the trial results: the posterior probabilities that the risk difference was more than 5 and 10 %; the posterior probabilities that given the results of all previous published trials an additional fictive trial would achieve a risk difference of at least 5 %; and the predictive probabilities that observed failure rate differ from 5 % across arms. Results Thirteen trials were identified including 1092 patients, 554 in the experimental group and 538 in the control group. The cumulative mean risk difference was 0. 5 % (95 % CrI: − 5. 7 %; + 4. 5 %). The posterior probabilities that the risk difference be superior to 5 and 10 % was less than 5 % after trial # 4 and trial # 2 respectively. The predictive probability that the difference in failure rates was at least 5 % dropped from 45 % after the first trial down to 11 % after the 13 th. Last, only unrealistic trial design parameters could change the overall evidence accumulated to date. Conclusions Bayesian probabilities are readily understandable when discussing the relevance of performing <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>trial.</b> It provides investigators the current probability that an experimental treatment be superior to a reference treatment. In case a trial is designed, it also provides the predictive probability that this <b>new</b> <b>trial</b> will reach the targeted risk difference in failure rates.

40|$|Meta-analyses of {{randomized}} controlled trials (RCTs) provide {{the highest level}} of evidence regarding the effectiveness of interventions and as such underpin much of evidence-based medicine. Despite this, meta-analyses are usually produced as observational by-products of the existing literature, with no formal consideration of future meta-analyses when individual trials are being designed. Basing the sample size of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>trial</b> on the results of an updated meta-analysis which will include it, may sometimes make more sense than powering the trial in isolation. <b>A</b> framework <b>for</b> sample size calculation <b>for</b> <b>a</b> future RCT {{based on the results of}} a meta-analysis of the existing evidence is presented. Both fixed and random effect approaches are explored through an example. Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation modelling is used for the random effects model since it has computational advantages over the classical approach. Several criteria on which to base inference and hence power are considered. The prior expectation of the power is averaged over the prior distribution for the unknown true treatment effect. An extension to the framework allowing for consideration of the design <b>for</b> <b>a</b> series of <b>new</b> <b>trials</b> is also presented. Results suggest that power can be highly dependent on the statistical model used to meta-analyse the data and even very large studies may have little impact on a meta-analysis when there is considerable between study heterogeneity. This raises issues regarding the appropriateness of the use of random effect models when designing and drawing inferences across a series of studies. 2009...|$|R
