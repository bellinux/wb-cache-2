They agreed on 750copies of an octavo edition, with a fee of 1,125francs paid to the author upon receipt of the manuscript– by mid-February. Balzac delivered the novel in July.|$|E
5|$|Goriot, {{supportive}} of Rastignac's <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> daughter and furious with her husband's tyrannical control over her, finds himself unable to help. When his other daughter, Anastasie, informs {{him that she}} has been selling off her husband's family jewelry to pay her lover's debts, the old man is overcome with grief at his own impotence and suffers a stroke.|$|E
5|$|After {{some time}} Alder {{developed}} <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> original family in Virginia. A companion, John Moore, learned that Alder {{had been taken}} prisoner near Greenbrier, and traveled to Wythe County to search for Alder's family. Initial inquiries were unsuccessful, but {{one of a series}} of advertisements Moore placed in the district was seen by Alder's surviving brother Paul. Paul then wrote Jonathan to inform him that the family was still alive.|$|E

5|$|An {{extremely}} shy man, Etty rarely socialised {{and never}} married. From 1824 {{until his death}} {{he lived with his}} niece Betsy (Elizabeth Etty). Even in London he retained a keen <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> native York, and was instrumental in the establishment of the town's first art school and the campaign to preserve York city walls. While he never formally converted from his Methodist faith, he was deeply attached to the Roman Catholic Church {{and was one of the}} few non-Catholics to attend the 1838 opening of Augustus Pugin's chapel for St Mary's College, Oscott.|$|E
5|$|As {{the years}} went by with further childlessness, Ernest became more distant to his wife, and was {{continually}} unfaithful. Though Alexandrine continued to be devoted, choosing to ignore those relationships she was aware of, her loyalty became increasingly baffling to those outside her immediate family. By 1859, after seventeen years of childlessness, Ernest took no further <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> wife.|$|E
5|$|At the {{marriage}} venue, Govindayya plots revenge by inciting Venkatapathy {{to insist on}} the dowry being paid before {{the marriage}}. Viyyanna issues a promisory note; Venkatapathy rejects it and drags Ramana from the marriage hall. However, Ramana leaves for Madras and lives there with Ammadu. When Venkatapathy arrives, Ramana feigns mental illness while Ammadu and Raja {{pretend to be a}} nurse and a doctor.

5|$|Constantine met {{his future}} wife, Norma Agatha Cox, in 1921. She had little {{interest}} in cricket and, although their relationship developed during the early 1920s, she resented that he gave more time to cricket than he did to her. However, the relationship lasted and she began to take more of an <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> sporting achievements. They were married on 25 July 1927; their only child, Gloria, was born in April 1928. Throughout their marriage, his wife motivated him to continue his efforts to further his career and they remained close. Norma died two months after her husband in 1971.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1980s and early 1990s, {{there was a}} {{resurgence}} of <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> life among young people. Hip-hop groups such as Public Enemy adopted MalcolmX as an icon, and his image was displayed in {{hundreds of thousands of}} homes, offices, and schools, as well as on T-shirts and jackets. This wave peaked in 1992 with the release of the film MalcolmX, an adaptation of The Autobiography of MalcolmX.|$|E
5|$|George's grandfather, King George II, {{disliked the}} Prince of Wales, and took little <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> grandchildren. However, in 1751 the Prince of Wales died {{unexpectedly}} from a lung injury, and George became heir apparent to the throne. He inherited {{one of his}} father's titles and became the Duke of Edinburgh. Now more interested in his grandson, three weeks later the King created George Prince of Wales (the title is not automatically acquired).|$|E

5|$|He {{appears to}} have taken little <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{official}} duties both as paymaster and inspector-general, leaving affairs {{in the hands of}} Edmund Waters. Waters had been his private secretary, and when Villiers came to office as paymaster, Waters was appointed chief clerk in that department, rising to deputy paymaster in 1797. Waters and Villiers invested in real estate with some of the money passing through the office; unfortunately for Villiers, Waters was also diverting some of the funds to his own interest in the Opera House, and the accounts of the office were in a shambles.|$|E
5|$|He {{worked at}} Nintendo until 1996, {{when he left}} to work at other {{developers}} including Electronic Arts, Vivendi Games, Midway Games, and THQ. He established Partly Cloudy Games with friends around 2009, and , runs mobile games studio Carried Away Games. After following the fan community from afar, he came out to fans in mid 2012 and the press began to show greater <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> work. He had planned {{to write a book}} about the game's development, release, and fandom as a Kickstarter project before a reply from Nintendo discouraged him from pursuing the idea.|$|E
5|$|However, Henry's army never progressed {{further than}} Leith; there the army could keep in {{physical}} {{contact with the}} supporting fleet. Henry took a personal <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> convoys, at one point even verbally instructing that two Scottish fishermen fishing in the Firth of Forth were to be paid £2 for their (unspecified) assistance. However, Henry never besieged Edinburgh Castle where the Duke of Rothsay was ensconced. By now, Brown says, Henry's campaign {{had been reduced to}} a 'war of words.' By 29 August, the English army had returned {{to the other side of}} the border.|$|E

5|$|I {{would hold}} that {{officers}} {{must have some}} level of particularized suspicion in order to conduct a seizure and search {{like the one at}} issue here, because (1) seizing one’s personal property deprives the individual of his valid possessory <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> property, and (2) authorizing a generalized computer forensic search (untethered to any particularized suspicion) permits the Government to engage in the type of generalized fishing expeditions that the Fourth Amendment is designed to prevent.|$|E
5|$|In 1920 {{the heirs}} of Venancio Sanchez {{filed a lawsuit}} against James Deering, {{claiming}} an undivided half <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> Cape Florida property. This brought development of the resort on Cape Florida to a halt. After many legal battles, the suit was finally decided in Deering's favor by the United States Supreme Court in 1926. The decision came too late for Deering; he had died the previous year.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Will (Eric McCormack) files {{a police}} report after his laptop {{computer}} is stolen. He then meets a police detective (Douglas) who takes a special <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> case as they go undercoverhowever, Will does {{not know that the}} detective participates in Jack's (Sean Hayes) therapy group for gays.

5|$|Not {{only did}} Sorabji, {{who had not}} written any music since 1968, return to {{composition}} {{as a result of}} Hinton's <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> work, but on 24 March 1976 he gave the pianist Yonty Solomon permission to play his works in public (although it has been claimed that Michael Habermann received tentative approval at an earlier date). Several recitals ensued and led to the making of a television documentary on Sorabji, which was broadcast in 1977. The images in it consisted mostly of still photographs of his house; there was just one brief shot of Sorabji waving to the departing camera crew.|$|E
5|$|Parsons' occult and libertarian polemical {{writings}} {{were published}} posthumously, with Western esoteric and countercultural circles citing {{him as one}} of the most significant figures in propagating Thelema across North America. Although academic <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> scientific career was originally negligible, in subsequent decades historians came to recognize Parsons' contributions to rocket engineering. For these innovations, his advocacy of space exploration and human spaceflight, and his role in the founding of JPL and Aerojet, Parsons is regarded as among the most important figures in the history of the U.S. space program. He has been the subject of several biographies and fictionalized portrayals.|$|E
5|$|The {{last year}} of Schubert's life was marked by growing public acclaim for the composer's works, {{but also by the}} gradual {{deterioration}} of his health. On March 26, 1828, together with other musicians in Vienna, Schubert gave a public concert of his own works, which was a great success and earned him a considerable profit. In addition, two new German publishers took an <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> works, leading to a short period of financial well-being. However, by the time the summer months arrived, Schubert was again short of money and had to cancel some journeys he had previously planned.|$|E
