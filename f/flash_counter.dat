40|$|An {{analysis}} of mining explosive accident reports indicates {{a need for}} clear and ample warning of approaching electrical storms to reduce injuries/fatalities due to lightning induced premature detonation. Six lightning warning devices were comparatively evaluated at three test sites. The devices tested were: (1) <b>flash</b> <b>counter,</b> (2) corona point, (3) radioactive probe, (4) field mill, (5) azimuth/range locator, and (6) triangulation locator. The test sites were chosen to provide system evaluation under varied thunderstorm conditions. The devices were tested at San Antonio, Texas, Kennedy Space Center, Florida and Langmuir Laboratory, New Mexico. Comparative performance is reviewed in terms of alarm reliability, false alarm, and failure to alarm probabilities. Lightning warning system requirements and methods of relating warning criteria to explosive hazard are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{seasonal}} and latitudinal {{variations of}} lightning ground flash activity in Australia have been analysed using lightning <b>flash</b> <b>counter</b> data. A number of parameters to describe lightning activity such as lightning-days, ground flash occurrence and ground flash frequency have been derived using counter registrations and compared for eigtheen localities across Australia. Lightning activity {{is the highest}} {{in the northern part of}} the country and it has a clear defined seasonality with sharp increases of lightning-days, ground flash occurrence and ground flash frequency during the wet season months. Lightning activity generally decreases towards the south and seasonal distributions of lightning parameters are more uniform in higher latitudes, but lightning mainly stays a summer phenomenon over Australia. A reduction in lightning ground flash density by a factor of about ten for a 30 º change in latitude has been found...|$|E
30|$|The two VEGA {{balloons}} deposited into Venus’ {{atmosphere in}} 1985 floated for ~[*] 48  h {{at an altitude}} of 50 – 55  km. Each gondola was equipped with a photodiode light gauge, including an electronic high-pass filter to detect flashes. No flash detections were reported: Sagdeev et al. (1986) notes that the intermediate-brightness <b>flash</b> <b>counter</b> on VEGA 2 did increment once, indicating a possible flash, but the measurement is suspicious because it was made near the terminator (where varying cloud-top altitudes could cause strong changes in ambient illumination) and that the lower-level threshold counter should also have incremented but did not. The VEGA data have recently been restored and made available for the NASA Planetary Data System (PDS)—Lorenz et al. (2018); it may be noted that the VEGA- 2 lander pressure-temperature profile therein is the only high-quality in situ atmospheric dataset that reaches {{all the way to the}} surface of Venus.|$|E

40|$|Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) is {{the driving}} force for {{thunderstorm}} development. CAPE is closely controlled by wet bulb temperature. The lightning activity measured by a network of ten lightning <b>flash</b> <b>counters</b> widely distributed across continental Australia was studied as a function of wet bulb temperature. At each of the stations, the monthly total of lightning ground flashes, N, increased sharply with the increase of the monthly mean daily maximum wet bulb temperature, Tw,max. The dependence was strongest in the tropics and became less pronounced at temperate latitudes. In Darwin (latitude 12 S), the lightning ground flash activity increased by over three orders of magnitude over a 7 C range of Tw,max. The corresponding increases for Coffs Harbour (latitude 30 S) and for Melbourne (latitude 38 S) were about one and a half orders of magnitude and about half an order of magnitude, respectively, each over a 10 C range of Tw,max. Power law approximations were derived for each of the ten stations and showed that the logarithm of N was directly proportional to the power, P, of Tw,max. The value of P showed a sharp exponential decrease with increasing latitude away from the equator...|$|R
40|$|The first {{systematic}} {{observations of}} cloud to ground (CG) lightning in Brazil {{began in the}} decade of 1960 by recording the number of thunderstorm days (thunderdays) at different sites. The observations were done up to 1980, when the first map of the CG activity in the country was obtained. However, due to {{the limited number of}} observation sites, only a very approximate map of the lightning activity was obtained (Figure 1). Based on it, it was estimated an average flash density of 7 flashes. km- 2. year- 1, indicating a larger lightning activity compared to most of the countries in the temperate region. The thunderday observations were followed by observations carried out by a network of <b>flash</b> <b>counters</b> in part of the Southeast region of the country (Figure 2). A 43 -flash counter network operated from 1985 to 1995, recording pulses by a trigger circuit with a band pass filter centered at 10 kHz. (Pinto et al., 2003 a). In 1985, an instrumented tower to record CG flashes was installed in the Morro do Cachimbo Station (MCS), in the Southeast region of the country. The station was built by the local power company, the Companhia Energética of Minas Gerais (CEMIG) under the orientation of Dr. A. J. Eriksson (Eriksson, 1979), with the goal to determine the electric parameters of direct discharges in towers. The station records the nearby CG lightning activity, the atmospheric electric field, and the direct current measurements. In addition, it provides photograph records and video images of the flashes striking the 60 -m metallic tower...|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrences of}} {{positive}} and negative polarity cloud-to-ground lightning flashes were detected by ground-based lightning flash counters CGR 4 in Brisbane, Australia. Positive (negative) flashes constituted 2 - 5 per cent (95 - 98 per cent) of total cloud-to-ground flashes. These results were compared with data obtained by a GPATS lightning location system over the period 2005 - 2008. It was found that prior to January 2007 the GPATS lightning location system was reporting an excessive proportion of ground flashes as being positive, with a correspondingly low proportion as negative. Over the same period, the CGR 4 lightning <b>flash</b> <b>counter</b> reported positive to negative ground flash ratios consistent with those obtained by other researchers both in Australia and elsewhere using a range of instrumentation. The high proportion of positive ground flashes (up to 50 per cent) recorded by the GPATS lightning location system in Australia prior to 2007 may be attributed to one or more possible factors, including (i) changes in the processing of raw GPATS sensor data implemented in January 2007, (ii) upgrades to sensor firmware, and (iii) the installation of more GPATS sensors...|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} {{deriving}} lightning ground flash density from CIGRE lightning <b>flash</b> <b>counter</b> registrations {{based on the}} detection efficiency of the instrument, independent of the latitudinal variation of cloud flash-to-ground flash ratio is presented. Using this method, the annual mean ground flash densities, N g, {{over a period of}} up to 22 years were recalculated from the counter registrations for 17 selected Australian sites. The results were compared with the corresponding thunder-day data, T d, to obtain an empirical formula of the form N g = a T d b. The best estimates of the empirical constants a and b derived using the proposed method were found to be 0. 012 and 1. 4 respectively. The derived N g values were compared with the values obtained from three other established formulae developed by earlier workers in different countries. The N g values were also compared with values derived using present methods of estimating lightning ground flash density which utilises the ratio of cloud flashes to ground flashes. Taking into account the improved method of calculation and the relatively long period of observation, we believe that the new empirical formula presented in this paper gives the best estimates of lightning ground flash density in Australia...|$|E
40|$|Rich {{internet}} applications (RIA) provide functionality and user-experience {{known from}} traditional desktop applications, but {{run in a}} web browser and do not require an installation. Most of todays RIA development approaches force the developer to implement too much logic on the client-side, causing severe portability, maintenance and security issues. Adobe Flash provides the base technology to build cross-platform applications. Adobe Flex is a Flash framework to compose sophisticated user-interfaces using ready-made widgets. Flex applications run in any Flash enabled web browser. Adobe AIR adds the possibility to run flash applications independent of a web browser and integrate into the host-system like a native application. Glare UI is a Smalltalk framework to build Adobe Flex applications in Smalltalk. View and business logic are implemented and executed on the server. Client and server communicate using the efficient binary protocol AMF through a bi-directional connection. View state is modeled completely on the server. At any point the client can request the list of changes made to the user-interface or re-request the entire user interface. The server subscribes to particular client events and automatically executes the registered Smalltalk code when it is notified of the event. The event object is serialized by the client and contains all relevant information about the event. This allows one to make changes to the business model and update the view. The <b>flashing</b> <b>counter</b> example To demonstrate the Glare UI framework we present {{the implementation of a}} counter, an application displaying a number and two buttons that increase respectively de-crease the number. The Smalltalk code implementing this functionality is shown in Figure 1.

[...] a darker {{twist to the}} [...] "Captain Spider" [...] story is depicted, with Flash still {{possessing}} his aggressive, selfish bully attitude from his early appearances. As Peter witnessed the spider-bite, he becomes Flash's confidant, and Flash strong-arms him into making a costume and weapons. Not wanting Flash to harm anyone permanently, Peter devises the web-shooters, but Flash uses his powers to become a super-criminal called [...] "The Spider". A pep talk from Aunt May and Uncle Ben inspires Peter to do something, using his scientific genius to create a robotic exo-skeleton (similar to Doctor Octopus' tentacles) and other methods which let him <b>counter</b> <b>Flash's</b> powers and incapacitate him. Later, Mr. Fantastic removes Flash's powers and remarks that Peter has a bright future ahead of him.|$|R
