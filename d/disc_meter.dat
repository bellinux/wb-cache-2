40|$|Every year, clean, readily {{available}} water {{becomes more and}} more scarce. Metering water usage is a way to make users more aware of how much water they use, which in turn will increase the desire to conserve water and to reduce their water bill. When meters are tested in their new condition, it is normally performed under ideal laboratory conditions at constant flow rates. Then when the meters are installed in the field, they often are installed in or experience non-recommended conditions that are quite different from the ideal laboratory setting. This study investigated several non-recommended conditions that can exist in a distribution system. The conditions that were simulated were endurance (the study of accuracy as a function of meter throughput), installation (the study of accuracy as a function of upstream piping and meter mounting effects), and flow profile (the study of accuracy as a result of dynamic real world flow variances over time). The meter types that were tested in this study were displacement piston, nutating disc, multi-jet, single-jet, fluidic oscillator, magnetic, and ultrasonic. When comparing the results between the meter types it was found that some meter types were more susceptible than others to the conditions that were simulated.

40|$|Background: Grasslands {{are heavily}} {{utilised}} for livestock agriculture {{and the resultant}} degradation through mismanagement contributes to an estimated 60 % of this biome being permanently transformed. This study focused {{on the impact of}} fire and grazing in moist highland grasslands. Objectives: To determine the contribution of burning frequency and grazing intensity combined (for domestic livestock and indigenous ungulates) on vegetation structure heterogeneity and species diversity. Methods: Eight study sites under different management regimes were sampled over two summers. Vegetation structure characteristics and diversity data were collected monthly within multiple replicates in each study site. A <b>disc</b> pasture <b>meter</b> was used to assess standing biomass. Differences in vegetation structure characteristics, plant community composition and plant species assemblage structure across sites were statistically analysed using analyses of variance, indicator species analyses, multidimensional scaling ordinations and two-way cluster analyses. Results: The combination of heavy grazing and annual burning leads to a distinct plant community dominated by disturbance specialist species. Selective grazing by indigenous herbivores promotes a community of unpalatable species. This study illustrates that fenced indigenous herbivores, even at moderate stocking densities, have a greater detrimental impact on plant diversity and structure than do domestic livestock. Conclusion: Intensive grazing and burning have a detrimental impact on plant species diversity and structure. This also affects resultant palatability for grazing livestock and fenced game. To promote both grazing quality and ecological integrity we recommend a minimum sustainable ‘fodder capacity’ or standing phytomass of 5000 kg per large-animal unit per hectare for domestic livestock in moist highland grasslands. </p...|$|R
40|$|Rangeland {{resources}} play {{a significant}} role in household production and sustainability of livelihoods among pastoral communities in Kenya. Although wildlife is one of the rangeland resources, it is viewed by pastoralists as a competitor with livestock for grazing resources rather than an economic resource. It is assumed that competition between wild herbivores and cattle may have an impact on the forage biomass in rangelands as well as on livestock production. It is from this view point of competition between wildlife and livestock for forage resources, that this study assessed effects of forage utilization by wildlife on cattle diet, plant community composition, forage biomass and level of forage utilization in semi-arid lands in Kenya. The following hypotheses were tested: there is a decline in proportion of dominant grasses due to wildlife grazing; there is a decline in forage biomass due to grazing by wildlife and there are changes in the diet of cattle (Bos indicus Lichtenstein) due to grazing by wild herbivores. Grazing experiments were conducted at the Kenya Long-term Exclosure Experiment (KLEE) on Mpala Ranch, Laikipia District, Kenya. A number of techniques were used during data collection: line transects and 1 m 2 quadrats to assess plant species composition, richness and diversity. Forage biomass and increment in forage weight in grazed and ungrazed exclosures were determined by use of a <b>disc</b> pasture <b>meter,</b> whereas plant species consumed by cattle and wild herbivores were assessed by observation during feeding.

The Nkuhlu exclosures in the Kruger National Park (KNP) provided opportunity to investigate spatial heterogeneity patterns within riparian zones, {{as well as how}} these patterns are affected by fire and herbivory. A monitoring project was initiated to answer questions about the dynamics of the herbaceous layer and was aimed at determining, (1) whether there exists meaningful variance in herbaceous plant species richness and diversity across different treatments in the ecologically sensitive sodic zone and (2) whether an increase in herbaceous biomass, an artefact of herbivory and fire exclusion, suppresses herbaceous plant species diversity and richness. Herbaceous vegetation was sampled in two 1 m 2 circular sub-plots in the eastern and western corners of 81 fixed plots. The biomass of each plot was estimated with a <b>disc</b> pasture <b>meter</b> (DPM) diagonally with the plot. DPM-readings were converted to kg/ha, according to the latest conversions for the Lowveld Savanna. Species richness and biomass showed significant variance across treatments, whereas no significant variation in herbaceous species diversity was perceived. Combined treatment of fire absence and herbivore presence contributed to higher forb species richness in the sodic zone. Biomass is significantly higher in fully fenced areas where herbivores are excluded, as opposed to the open and partially fenced areas. Although no significant variation was recorded for diversity across treatments, lowest diversity was recorded in the absence of all herbivores, especially in combination with fire treatment. Therefore herbivores are essential in sustaining herbaceous plant species richness in the sodic zone, whilst no significant results were found with regard to their effect on species diversity. Although statistically non-significant, fire seems to suppress species richness. [URL]...|$|R

It isn't entirely clear to me what purpose it is supposed to serve, but it seems like unnecessary clutter. I also strongly dislike the superfluous file preview feature which wastes a lot of screen space in order to display a playable video thumbnail. The preview feature is fortunately easy to disable.The whole programs feels uncharacteristically clunky by GNOME standards, but it's a lot more functional than the stale and unambitious CD burning component that was included in previous versions of GNOME. I think that Brasero is the right way forward in the long term, but the user interface really doesn't please me.My biggest complaint with the old Nautilus CD burner is that it didn't give you clear visual hints about how much space you have left when you are putting in files to burn. The fact that Brasero dropped that feature is a bit of a disappointment. It seems like the task of building a good disc burning UI with GTK+ is not trivial and it's something that I suspect will take a skilled designer rather than a developer.Despite the problems with Brasero's interface, it's really a very capable program with a rich feature set, which leaves me hopeful that it will be able to really shine someday..|$|R

40|$|Rotational {{microfluidic}} platforms {{have attracted}} swiftly growing interest {{over the last}} decade due to their suitability for integration and automation of sample preparation and detection. Valving is of pivotal importance on these compact “Lab-on-a-Disc” (LoaD) platforms as all liquids are exposed to the same centrifugal field. A number of valving technologies have been developed to coordinate timing of serial and / or parallel multi-step / multi-liquid assay protocols comprising of laboratory unit opera-tions (LUOs) such as the release, metering and mixing of sample and reagents. So far these valving techniques could be broadly categorised into rotationally controlled or externally actuated schemes. Only recently a new, “event-triggered” flow control has been introduced. In this approach, a valve is opened upon arrival of a liquid at a defined destination on the disc; this innovative mechanism for the first time permits the cascading of LUOs independent of the spin rate. In one technology, dissolvable films (DFs) are configured with a pneumatic chamber to offer function akin to an electrical relay. Dissolving one DF, termed the control film (CF), results in the release of liquid at a distal location through a so-called load film (LF). In this paper, a new method for temporal control of actuating DF-based, event-triggered CFs which are serially aligned at defined distances along a paper strip is introduced. Liquids are transported through the paper strip at a given velocity, thus setting well-defined intervals between subsequent LUOs, e. g. incubation steps. As a proof-of-concept, we present a <b>disc</b> with inte-grated <b>metering</b> and mixing which can perform a prototypical, 4 -fold serial dilution; a common function in bioanalytical protocols. Imbibition of the paper strip sequentially opens five valves for serial dilution and mixing. To illustrate an unprecedented level of on-disc automation, this is followed by a branched cascade of 17 event-triggered valves (for a total of 22 liquid handling steps) which completes the serial dilution protocol...|$|R
40|$|MSc (Environmental Sciences), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Understanding {{relationships}} between large herbivores and plant species diversity in dynamic riparian zones, {{and more specifically}} sodic zones, is critical to biodiversity conservation. Sodic patches form {{an integral part of}} savanna ecosystems because of the ecosystem services and functions they provide, i. e. accumulation of nutrients, provision of open spaces for predator vigilance and formation of wet season wallowing points. Furthermore, these key resource areas sustain body condition for dry season survival and support reproduction through nutritional benefits, making them „nutrient hotspots. ‟ The Nkuhlu research exclosures in the Kruger National Park (KNP) provide a unique opportunity to investigate spatial and temporal heterogeneity patterns within riparian zones, and how these patterns are affected by fire and herbivory. A monitoring project was initiated to answer questions pertaining to the dynamics of the herbaceous layer and was aimed at determining (a) whether there exists meaningful variance in herbaceous plant species richness and diversity across different treatments of fire and herbivory in the ecologically sensitive sodic zone, (b) if temporal shifts in plant species composition and diversity occurs, (c) whether an increase in herbaceous biomass, an artifact of herbivory and fire exclusion, suppresses herbaceous plant species diversity and richness, and (d) whether there exists a significant relationship between herbaceous biomass and species richness/diversity. The Nkuhlu exclosures consist of three herbivory treatments, each divided into a fire and no-fire treatment, hence six treatment combinations overall. Herbivory treatments consisted of, (1) a partially fenced area designed to specifically exclude elephants (giraffes are also excluded due to body size), (2) an open, unfenced area and (3) a fully fenced area, designed to exclude all herbivores larger than a hare. Herbaceous vegetation was sampled in two 1 m 2 circular sub-plots in the eastern and western corners of each of the 82 fixed plots. Biomass of each plot was estimated with a <b>Disc</b> Pasture <b>Meter</b> (DPM) by sampling ten points diagonally within each plot. DPM-readings were converted to kg/ha according to latest conversions for the Lowveld Savanna. Species richness and biomass showed significant variance across treatments for the 2010 dataset, whereas no significant variation in herbaceous species diversity was perceived. Combined treatment of fire absence and herbivore presence contributed to higher forb species richness in the sodic zone. Biomass was significantly higher in fully fenced areas where herbivores were excluded, opposed to the open and partially fenced areas. Although no significant variation was recorded for diversity across treatments, lowest diversity was recorded in the absence of all herbivores, especially in combination with fire treatment. After nine years of herbivory exclusion, diversity of herbaceous species varied significantly. Herbaceous species composition changed over time in areas exposed to herbivory, while composition of fully fenced treatments did not reveal change. A hump-shaped relationship exists between herbaceous species richness/diversity and field biomass, at least for areas with biomass levels not exceeding 2500 kg/ha. Herbivores are therefore considered essential in sustaining herbaceous plant species richness and system heterogeneity in the sodic zone, since herbaceous species richness/diversity was higher in herbivore presence and herbaceous species composition changed over time in areas exposed to herbivory. Although statistically non-significant, fire seems to suppress species richness. Conservation implications: This study could be used as framework to advance and develop sciencebased management strategies for, at least, the sodic zones of the KNP. Research in these exclosures contributes to our understanding of these landscapes and benefit ecosystem conservation planning. It also provides valuable long-term data for key ecological processes.
