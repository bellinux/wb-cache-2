40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{classification}} of common symptoms {{and the laws of}} syndrome element combination in 251 cases of stable angina pectoris (SAP) by using cluster analysis and corresponding-correlation analysis. Methods: A total of 251 SAP cases were selected and their information from four diagnosis in traditional Chinese medicine was recorded. The classification of common symptom and the laws of syndrome element combination were investigated by cluster analysis and corresponding-correlation analysis. Results: Twenty-five symptoms found in 251 SAP cases were divided into four types by cluster analysis: <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> qi, deficiency of spleen qi, deficiency of qi and yin, and phlegm accumulation and blood stasis. The <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> qi had the closest relation to phlegm accumulation and blood stasis. By corresponding-correlation analysis, the deficiency of qi had the closest relation to blood stasis, next was turbid phlegm and heat stagnation, and then deficiency of qi and deficiency of yin. Conclusion: Blood stasis due to deficient qi is the key factor in pathogenesis of SAP. Deficiency of qi plus blood stasis, deficiency of qi plus deficiency of yin, blood stasis plus turbid phlegm, <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> qi plus blood stasis plus turbid phlegm are common syndrome element combinations of SAP.

40|$|Objective：To {{investigate}} the distribution characteristics of syndrome types of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in essential hypertension {{and to explore}} the distribution rule of TCM syndromes. Methods: A multicenter, large-sample survey method of clinical epidemiology was applied to choose the patients with essential hypertension from North, Middle, and South China. A questionnaire was designed and filled in, then 477 untreated patients with first-diagnosed essential hypertension were selected and the information was recorded into FileMaker database. A cluster analysis method was utilized to study the TCM syndrome distribution rule of essential hypertension. Results: Two-step cluster analysis was done from 3 to 7 clusters. Seven clusters were appropriate, which included <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> and kidney qi, hyperactivity of liver-yang, deficiency of yin and yang, stagnation of phlegm-dampness, phlegm-heat (subtype of stagnation of phlegm-dampness), blood stasis obstructing collaterals, and other syndromes. The symptoms presenting high percentage in each cluster were more significant in TCM theory. The syndromes of hyperactivity of liver-yang (24. 1 %) and stagnation of phlegm-dampness (27. 1 %) presented the high percentages, and <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> and kidney qi (10. 1 %), deficiency of yin and yang (8. 4 %), and blood stasis obstructing collaterals (9. 0 %) presented the low percentages. Conclusion: As compared with the current syndrome differentiation criteria, two-step cluster analysis results not only include the syndromes of deficiency of yin and yang, hyperactivity of liver-yang, stagnation of phlegm-dampness, but also cover qi deficiency and blood stasis...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} main {{characteristics}} of syndromes in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in post-stroke depression (PSD) {{and to provide}} basis for treatments with TCM herbs. Methods: According to diagnostic criteria of PSD, stroke patients and depression patients from Department of Neurology, First Affiliated Hospital, Anhui University of Traditional Chinese Medicine were assigned into cerebral stroke group (150 cases), depression group (151 cases) and PSD group (123 cases). Neuropsychological assessments and imaging and biochemical analyses were conducted. TCM syndrome differentiation for these diseases was performed. We also determined the characteristics of TCM syndromes of PSD, relative risk of the syndromes and their correlations with ages as well. Results: Scores of qi stagnation and blood stasis, liver qi depression, and transformation of fire due to qi stagnation in PSD group were significant higher than those in cerebral stroke group (P< 0. 05, P< 0. 01). In cerebral stroke group, majority of the patients displayed one syndrome, while in PSD and depression groups, the patients had three or more syndromes. Of these syndromes, the incidence rate of syndrome of liver qi depression complicated with transformation of fire due to qi stagnation or flaring of fire due to yin deficiency was high. The syndrome of liver qi depression occurred much more frequently in PSD group and depression group than in cerebral stroke group (P< 0. 05, P< 0. 01). The logistic regression analysis showed that the syndrome of qi stagnation and blood stasis had high relative risk to PSD. The syndrome of <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> and spleen {{was positively correlated with}} age in cerebral stroke group. Conclusion: The main TCM syndromes of PSD and depression are qi stagnation and blood stasis, liver qi depression, and transformation of fire due to qi stagnation. The syndrome of <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> and spleen is closely related to age among the stroke patients. The syndrome of qi stagnation and blood stasis serves as an independent risk factor for PSD. The more complicated the syndromes are, the more serious depression becomes...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the characteristics of}} syndromes of phlegm and blood stasis in patients with coronary heart disease by multiple statistical methods of matching matrix, factor analysis and clustering analysis, and to provide some references for classification and normalization of diagnosis of syndromes of phlegm and blood stasis of coronary heart disease. Methods: The correlations among 46 kinds of symptoms in syndrome of non-phlegm and non-blood stasis, syndrome of blood stasis, syndrome of phlegm and syndrome of phlegm-blood stasis blocking in 200 patients with coronary heart disease were analyzed by matching matrix, factor analysis and clustering analysis. Results: The manifestations of tongue and pulse in syndromes of phlegm and blood stasis were significantly different from those in syndrome of non-phlegm and non-blood stasis. The pathogenesis of viscera in syndromes of phlegm and blood stasis lied in the heart and kidney, andthe syndrome of <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> qi {{was the most common}} one while the syndrome of deficiency of kidney qi took the secondary place. The syndrome of phlegm was often accompanied by syndrome of deficiency of spleen qi. Only 15 ones of 46 clinical symptoms showed high frequency in concomitant appearance in syndrome of blood stasis, syndrome of phlegm and syndrome of phlegm-blood stasis blocking. Apart from having the common symptoms in syndrome of deficiency in origin, the syndrome of phlegm especially showed white and greasy fur and slippery pulse as well as distention and fullness of chest and abdominal distension; the syndrome of blood stasis showed purplish tongue and ecchymosis on tongue as well as fixed pain; and the syndrome of phlegm-blood stasis blocking showed the main symptoms of both syndrome of phlegm and syndrome of blood stasis.

Methods: The TCM symptoms {{in line with the}} diagnostic criteria of subhealth fatigue status were collected by clinical investigations and using information collection form based on TCM four diagnostic methods. Referred to Clinical Guidelines of Chinese Medicine on Subhealth and other related standards, the syndrome type was identified in accordance with clinical symptoms of each patient with subhealth fatigue by two physicians. The data of syndrome differentiation were analyzed by descriptive statistical analysis. Results: There were 81 syndrome types from 495 cases of subhealth fatigue. There were 24 syndrome types after separation, and the top ten were liver stagnation and spleen <b>deficiency,</b> stagnation <b>of</b> liver qi, hyperactivity of liver fire, disharmony between liver and stomach, damp obstruction due to spleen <b>deficiency,</b> <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> both <b>heart</b> and spleen, yin <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> liver and kidney, yang <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> spleen and kidney, stagnation of gallbladder and disturbance of phlegm, and internal disturbance of phlegm-heat. There were 17 syndrome elements, including seven disease location elements and ten disease nature elements. The disease location elements were liver, spleen, kidney, stomach, heart, gallbladder and lung. The disease nature elements were qi stagnation, qi <b>deficiency,</b> exuberance <b>of</b> fire (heat), damp obstruction, phlegm obstruction, yin <b>deficiency,</b> adverse flow <b>of</b> qi, yang <b>deficiency,</b> blood deficiency, and blood stasis. Conclusion: Syndrome types of subhealth fatigue involve in deficiency syndrome, excess syndrome, and mixture <b>of</b> <b>deficiency</b> and excess syndromes.

METHODS: From August 1, 2009 to July 31, 2010, 705 patients with GAD in 10 hospitals of Beijing were investigated over one year. Data mining techniques, such as Bayes net and cluster analysis, were {{used to analyze the}} syndrome discipline of GAD. RESULTS: A total of 61 symptoms of GAD were screened out. By using Bayes net, nine syndromes of GAD were abstracted based on the symptoms. Eight syndromes were abstracted by cluster analysis. After screening for duplicate syndromes and combining the experts’ experience and traditional Chinese medicine theory, six syndromes of GAD were defined. These included depressed liver qi transforming into fire, phlegm-heat harassing the heart, liver depression and spleen deficiency, heart-kidney non-interaction, dual <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> the <b>heart</b> and spleen, and kidney deficiency and liver yang hyperactivity.

40|$|Background—Human cardiac {{stem cells}} (CSCs) promote {{myocardial}} regeneration in adult ischemic myocardium. The regenerative capacity of CSCs in very young patients with nonischemic congenital heart defects {{has not been}} explored. We hypothesized that isolated neonatal-derived CSCs may have a higher regenerative ability than adult-derived CSCs and might address the structural <b>deficiencies</b> <b>of</b> congenital <b>heart</b> disease. Methods and Results—Human specimens were obtained during routine cardiac surgical procedures from right atrial appendage tissue discarded from 2 age groups: neonates and adults patients. We developed a reproducible isolation method that generated cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs), regardless of starting tissue weight or age. Neonatal-derived CDCs demonstrated increased number of cardiac progenitor cells expressing c-kit, flk- 1, and Islet- 1 by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. When transplanted into infarcted myocardium, neonatal-derived CDCs had a significantly higher ability to preserve myocardial function, prevent adverse remodeling, and enhance blood vessel preservation and/or formation when compared with adult-derived CDCs. Last, neonatal-derived CDCs were more cardiomyogenic than adult-derived CDCs when cocultured with neonatal cardiomyocytes and displayed enhanced angiogenic function compared with adult-derived CDCs. Conclusions—Neonatal-derived CDCs have a strong regenerative ability when compared with adult-derived CDCs that may depend on angiogenic cytokines and an increase prevalence of stem cells.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that the pathophysiology <b>of</b> chronic <b>heart</b> failure (CHF) {{may be due to}} a relative <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and/or blunted responsiveness to ANF in this state. The work presented in this thesis evaluates the role of ANF in rats with chronic moderate high-output heart failure by (1) characterizing plasma and tissue ANF levels, hemodynamics and renal function at different stages of the development <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> failure; (2) assessing the contribution of the atria and ventricles to plasma ANF levels; and (3) investigating the role of ANF and renin-angiotensin systems (RAS) in rats with aorto-caval (A-C) shunts. Chronically increased cardiac filling pressure stimulated not only ANF release but also ANF synthesis in each cardiac chamber. This in turn contributed to elevated plasma ANF levels in A-C shunt rats. An attenuated renal response to endogenous ANF and sodium and water retention were apparent in A-C shunt rats. Under inhibition of RAS, plasma ANF may exert its actions more effectively. Thus, chronic ACE inhibition and ANG II receptor antagonism improved hemodynamic conditions, diminished water retention, reversed cardiac hypertrophy, and restored plasma and tissue ANF to more "normal" levels in rats with moderate high-output heart failure. Taken together, elevated plasma ANF levels may {{play an important role in}} maintaining hemodynamic and body fluid homeostasis by opposing the neurohormonal vasoconstrictor systems in A-C shunt rats. However, a relative <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> plasma ANF and/or an attenuated response to endogenous ANF, mediated by activated neurohormonal vasoconstrictor systems, may contribute to the pathophysiology and development <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> failure at different stages.

In March in 2010 was published 59 % of people are affected by <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> vitamin D and 25 % from them are affected by acute <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> vitamin D (Gilsanz et al., 2010). <b>Deficiency</b> <b>of</b> vitamin D is typically for people who don't expose for the Sun and eat poor food for vitamin D, for women after menopause and for people afflicted with failure of kidney, liver, intestine absorption and hyperparathyroidism. <b>Deficiency</b> <b>of</b> vitamin D is the most critical for children because of disrupting their growing of cartilages, bones and teeth. Bones begin soft, fragile and usually are deformed by weight of body. Disease with these symptoms is known like rickets. In adults <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> vitamin D can cause bad accumulation of calcium in bones and so bones are demineralized, thin, soft and easy to deform [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|We {{employed}} Cre/loxP {{technology to}} generate mPDK 1 (-/-) mice, which lack PDK 1 in cardiac muscle. Insulin did not activate PKB and S 6 K, {{nor did it}} stimulate 6 -phosphofructo- 2 -kinase and production of fructose 2, 6 -bisphosphate, in the <b>hearts</b> <b>of</b> mPDK 1 (-/-) mice, consistent with PDK 1 mediating these processes. All mPDK 1 (-/-) mice died suddenly between 5 and 11 weeks of age. The mPDK 1 (-/-) animals had thinner ventricular walls, enlarged atria and right ventricles. Moreover, mPDK 1 (-/-) muscle mass was markedly reduced due {{to a reduction in}} cardiomyocyte volume rather than cardiomyocyte cell number, and markers <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> failure were elevated. These results suggested mPDK 1 (-/-) mice died <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> failure, a conclusion supported by echocardiographic analysis. By employing a single-cell assay we found that cardiomyocytes from mPDK 1 (-/-) mice are markedly more sensitive to hypoxia. These results establish that the PDK 1 signalling network {{plays an important role in}} regulating cardiac viability and preventing heart failure. They also suggest that a <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> the PDK 1 pathway might contribute to development of cardiac disease in humans...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Recent {{studies have}} shown that in chronic kidney disease (CKD) 25 (OH) D {{deficiency}} or insufficiency are a significant risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, sudden cardiac death and mortality. The high incidence of premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) have increasingly been recognized as a primary cause for worsening left ventricular systolic function and heart failure in some patients, specialty when these subjects are under optimal treatment and have implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), because the great amount of PVCs reduces the percentage of cardiac resynchronization. Aim: Our aim was to evaluate the influence of reposition of cholecalciferol in patients with <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> vitamin D in the changes of the numbers of PVCs, and consequently in the percentage of cardiac resynchronization time, during 6  months of follow-up. Methods and results: We conducted a prospective, longitudinal study of 56 patients with high incidence <b>of</b> PVCs, <b>heart</b> failure under optimal treatment, ICD + CRT, <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> vitamin D (≤ 20  ng/mL) and CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate measured by MDRD equation, between 16 and 59  mL/min/ 1. 73  m 2). All patients were treated with cholecalciferol. We observed significant ameliorating after cholecalciferol onset in the number of PVCs, CRT % time, renal function, vitamin D levels and plasmatic ions at the 6 th month of follow-up vs. baseline. Conclusions: We suggest that the effectiveness of cholecalciferol reposition for subjects with high incidence <b>of</b> PVCs, <b>heart</b> failure under optimal treatment, ICD + CRT, <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> vitamin D and CKD, restoring the function of the CRT, bringing the biventricular pacing to nearby 97 %...|$|R
40|$|Interaction {{of normal}} and {{coagulation}} factor deficient bloods with glass, Teflon and silicone-coated glass surfaces have been studied. The morphology of the blood-surface interaction was observed by scanning electron microscopy. Activation of the intrinsic coagulation system and progression of these changes, monitored {{by use of}} the partial thromboplastin time test, were influenced by both the type of surface to which blood was exposed and the <b>deficiencies</b> <b>of</b> coagulation Factors I, VIII, IX, or XII. <b>Deficiency</b> <b>of</b> fibrinogen appears to enhance, minimally, activation of the coagulation sequences by test materials. However, <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> fibrinogen markedly reduces adhesion of platelets to foreign surfaces. <b>Deficiency</b> <b>of</b> Factor XII, but not of Factors VIII or IX, decreases platelet adhesion to nonbiologic surfaces but {{to a lesser extent}} than does <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> fibrinogen. Roughness of test surfaces appears to encourage cellular deposition from blood. An ex vivo model designed for screening materials for their compatibility with blood is described...|$|R
40|$|Likelihood {{analysis}} using two autosomal/X-linked mixed models confirmed that Alport syndrome is an X-linked dominant disease {{in a large}} Utah kindred, family P. The penetrance was estimated as. 85 in females and 1. 0 in males. Previously reported abnormal segregation ratios were reexamined. No excess of affected offspring of affected parents was found. Nor was the penetrance in daughters of asymptomatic carrier mothers found to be lower than in the daughters of symptomatic mothers, although the sample size was small. However, there was an unexplained <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> sons of affected fathers.
