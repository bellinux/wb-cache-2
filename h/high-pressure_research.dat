40|$|Abstract. High-pressure-induced carbon {{transport}} from diamond anvils {{into the}} pressure chamber of diamond anvil cells (DACs) was studied by micro-Raman spectroscopy. Depending on experi-mental conditions (temperature and pressure), various carbon phases (amorphous carbon, diamond, microcrystalline or nanocrystalline graphite) were {{detected in the}} originally carbon-free samples. Temperature-induced growth of a graphite phase at the sample/diamond interface was observed in situ at high pressure in an externally heated DAC. In laser-heated samples inside the pressure-transmitting medium, at pressures above 6 GPa there was transport of carbon from the diamond culet surface into the heated part of the sample. These observations suggest that account should be taken of possible carbon diffusion in <b>high-pressure</b> <b>research</b> with DACs, such as high-pressure melting, element partitioning, phase transformations, chemical reactions, and electrical resistivity. ...|$|E

Since Percy Bridgeman was recognized by the 1946 Nobel Prize for his contribution to high-pressure physics, <b>high-pressure</b> <b>research</b> as an interdisciplinary area has attracted extensive attentions.

For instance, brand new classes of inorganic materials of unusual stoichiometries and crystal structures, with wide range of optical, mechanical, electronic and magnetic properties, have been produced at high pressure. Pressure-induced structural transformations between crystalline and amorphous materials, as well as among insulators, conductors and even superconductors, have been extensive documented. This Ph. D. work focused on investigating pressure-induced structural transformations in materials and understanding the involved chemistry, which was assembled into two parts. In part I, two molecular systems, chlorocyclohexane (CCH) and azobenzene (AB), were investigated to examine the pressure effect on chemical conformations, stability of ring structures and reactivities using Raman spectroscopy. For CCH, pressure-induced conformational change as well as rich phase transformations were observed upon compression. Both AB and hydrazobenzene (HAB) underwent a phase transition at a similar pressure. However, origins of these phase transformations were drastically different. High-pressure structures of both molecules were examined based on spectroscopic data. Their distinctive high-pressure behaviors were analyzed and interpreted with the aid of ab initio molecular orbital calculations. Part II focuses on pressure-induced structural transformations of one dimensional (1 D) nanomaterials using vibrational spectroscopy and synchrotron X-ray diffraction. Individual studies were first carried out on BN nanotubes and GaN nanowires aiming at investigating their high-pressure behaviors.

40|$|Based on his 50 -year {{career in}} static <b>{{high-pressure}}</b> <b>research,</b> P. W. Bridgman (PWB) {{is the father}} of modern high-pressure physics. What is not generally recognized is that Bridgman was also intimately connected with establishing shock compression as a scientific tool and he predicted major events in shock research that occurred up to 40 years after his death. In 1956 the first phase transition under shock compression was reported in Fe at 13 GPa (130 kbar). PWB said a phase transition could not occur in a ~microsec, thus setting off a controversy. The scientific legitimacy of shock compression resulted 5 years later when static high-pressure researchers confirmed with x-ray diffraction the existence of epsilon-Fe. Once PWB accepted the fact that shock waves generated with chemical explosives were a valid scientific tool, he immediately realized that substantially higher pressures would be achieved with nuclear explosives. He included his ideas for achieving higher pressures in articles published a few years after his death. L. V. Altshuler eventually read Bridgman articles and pursued the idea of using nuclear explosives to generate super high pressures, which subsequently morphed today into giant lasers. PWB also anticipated combining static and shock methods, which today is done with pre-compression of a soft sample in a diamond anvil cell followed by laser-driven shock compression. One variation of that method is the reverberating-shock technique, in which the first shock pre-compresses a soft sample and subsequent reverberations isentropically compress the first-shocked state.

40|$|Silicon {{is still}} a {{dominating}} element in terms of industrial applications and also fundamental research. Silicon oxides {{play a key role}} for insulator layers in integrated circuits and coatings for opto-electric devices. A microscopic understanding of the silicon-oxide structure is therefore highly demanded. New nanostructured silicon compounds showing particular physical behavior have been discovered during the last decade. So, endohedrally doped silicon clathrates are promising materials for thermo-electric applications and tailored band-gaps. The study of the interaction between the guest atoms and the host silicon network is crucial to understand changes in physical properties. Also in the view of fundamental research silicon clathrates show exciting structural and electronic phase-transitions under high pressure. Access to the structural and electronic information in bulk amorphous silicon monoxide and complex silicon compounds can be achieved by the study of absorption edges. Non-resonant inelastic x-ray scattering is a powerful tool to measure shallow absorption edges using hard x-rays. This allows the study of low energy transitions under conditions which do not permit electrons and soft x-rays. In the present work, an algorithm is presented for the proper experimental extraction of momentum-transfer dependent scattering spectra. A comparison with ab-initio calculations can contribute significantly {{to the understanding of the}} experimental spectra. Therefore, the applicability and the limits of theoretical approaches are elaborated in a study of the pure elements silicon, magnesium and sodium. Based on these methodical advances, the disproportionation of bulk amorphous silicon monoxide is analyzed and compared to the interface clusters mixture model for the SiO structure. Complex nano-structured barium doped silicon networks are examined by the survey of the barium giant dipole resonance. The first observation of different modulations of the resonance depending on the structure will be presented and future applications on <b>high-pressure</b> <b>research</b> will be highlighted...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{importance}} of rheological properties in controlling the dynamics and evolution of the whole mantle of Earth is well-recognized, experimental studies of rheological properties and deformation-induced microstructures have mostly been limited to low-pressure conditions. This is mainly a result of technical limitations in conducting quantitative rheological experiments under high-pressure conditions. A combination of factors is changing this situation. Increased resolution of composition and configuration of Earth's interior has created a greater demand for well-resolved laboratory measurement {{of the effects of}} pressure on the behavior of materials. Higher-strength materials have become readily available for containing <b>high-pressure</b> <b>research</b> devices, and new analytical capabilities [...] in particular very bright synchrotron X-ray sources [...] are now readily available to high-pressure researchers. One of the biggest issues in global geodynamics is the style of mantle convection and the nature of chemical differentiation associated with convectional mass transport. Although evidence for deep mantle circulation has recently been found through seismic tomography (e. g., van der Hilst et al. (1997)), complications in convection style have also been noted. They include (1) significant modifications of flow geometry across the mantle transition zone as seen from high resolution tomographic studies (Fukao et al. 1992; Masters et al. 2000; van der Hilst et al. 1991) and (2) complicated patterns of flow in the deep lower mantle ({approx} 1500 - 2500 km), perhaps caused by chemical heterogeneity (Kellogg et al. 1999; van der Hilst and Karason 1999). These studies indicate that while large-scale circulation involving the whole mantle no doubt occurs, significant deviations from simple flow geometry are also present. Two mineral properties have strong influence on convection: (1) density and (2) viscosity (rheology) contrasts. In the past, the effects of density contrast have been emphasized (Honda et al. 1993; Kellogg et al. 1999; Tackley et al. 1993), and the influence of rheology has been demonstrated by geodynamic modeling (Davies 1995; Karato et al. 2001) ...|$|E
