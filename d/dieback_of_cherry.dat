Additionally, virus symptoms are influenced by many abiotic factors such as time of the year, weather, and type of cultivar. [...] Due to degree of severity, some plants may only show <b>dieback</b> <b>of</b> leaves and flower necrosis on infected branches, while others will show the initial shock reaction that includes <b>dieback</b> <b>of</b> leaves and a second flush developing later in the season.|$|R
50|$|Ascospora ruborum is {{a species}} of {{anamorphic}} ascomycete fungus. It is a plant pathogen that causes cane spot and <b>dieback</b> <b>of</b> raspberry and dewberry.|$|R

40|$|Three {{types of}} factors {{influence}} the <b>dieback</b> <b>of</b> forest stands — factors that predispose stands, trigger factors that initiate dieback, and {{factors that contribute}} to further decline.

50|$|A 2012 resultor {{algae bloom}} {{resulted}} in a 50% <b>dieback</b> <b>of</b> sea grass, vital for marine creatures. The bloom {{is believed to have}} been triggered by extreme winter cold spells and drought.|$|R
50|$|Tree peonies {{in general}} can suffer from peony wilt (Botrytis paeoniae, a grey mould blight) and verticillium wilt, which may cause wilting and <b>dieback</b> <b>of</b> young shoots. In {{infected}} soils, honey fungus can cause instant death.|$|R
50|$|In gooseberries, currants, and raspberries, <b>dieback</b> <b>of</b> shoots and {{branches}} is common {{and although the}} plant may produce many blossom buds {{in the early stages}} of deficiency, fruit yields turn out low and the fruits are of poor quality.|$|R
50|$|The {{presence}} of the territorial and aggressive bell miner (Manorina melanophrys) and psyllid insects (Glycaspis) is correlated with <b>dieback</b> <b>of</b> the canopy of E. saligna, a syndrome which has been termed bell-miner-associated dieback (BMAD), though the exact mechanism remains unclear.|$|R
50|$|Larvae bore {{inside an}} {{eggplant}} fruit and feed until they pupate. Fruit feeding {{is the major}} cause of damage. The larvae may also bore into tender shoots causing wilting and <b>dieback</b> <b>of</b> the branch terminals. This reduces the fruit-bearing capacity of plant.|$|R

50|$|Toward {{the last}} two weeks of April, one can see a two-mile avenue of {{continuous}} rows <b>of</b> <b>cherry</b> blossoms on Chapel Avenue between Haddonfield Road and Kings Highway.

50|$|In France {{since the}} 1920s, the first <b>cherries</b> <b>of</b> the season always come in march {{from the region}} of Céret, where the local {{producers}} always send, as a tradition since 1932, the first crate <b>of</b> <b>cherries</b> to the French president of the Republic. In 1938, 45000 out <b>of</b> the 90000 <b>cherry</b> trees <b>of</b> Pyrénées-Orientales are in the canton of Céret. The 25000 cherry trees in Céret only then give 1250 tons <b>of</b> <b>cherries</b> each year.

40|$|Twigs {{and seeds}} of Azadirachta indica (Neem) {{infected}} with dieback disease, collected from {{different regions of}} Karnataka, India were analyzed to det. the pathogens. Phomopsis azadirachtae, the causal agent <b>of</b> <b>dieback</b> disease <b>of</b> neem {{was found to be}} seed borne. Phomopsis azadirachtae was isolated on PDA and MEA from dieback-infected neem twigs, seeds and embryo. Phomopsis genus-specific primers (5. 8 S rDNA) were then used for the detection of Phomopsis azadirachtae, the causative agent <b>of</b> <b>dieback</b> <b>of</b> neem by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Reactions were performed on DNA isolated from twigs, seeds and embryo of dieback-affected neem trees. Studies revealed the amplification of expected 141 bp DNA in Phomopsis azadirachtae isolated from various parts of diseased trees indicating the causal organism <b>of</b> <b>dieback</b> disease on neem. Isolation and identification by conventional technique takes around 15 - 21 days, whereas the present technique is capable of detecting very low propogules within 4 - 5 days. [on SciFinder(R) ...|$|R

50|$|A {{market for}} a {{particular}} commodity is in partial equilibrium if, at the current prices of all commodities, the quantity of the commodity demanded by potential buyers equals the quantity supplied by potential sellers.
