The concert was {{presented}} {{as part of the}} country's yearlong celebration of its 2,000th year according to the Coptic calendar. At the end of the concert Knowles stated [...] "I want to thank you. You {{have been one of the}} best audiences of my lifetime." [...] About the wardrobe worn by Knowles during the concert, Anita Powell of the Associated Press noted that she was covered in sequins or shiny, space-age material — from a modern interpretation of a hula girl with shiny black tendrils replacing the grass skirt to a high-necked Victorian-style top.|$|E
500|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Gavin Bowden, was first released December 7, 2000 on Vh1.com. It {{served as an}} official video for the song, after an unofficial version was released by DreamWorks as a [...] "temporary video" [...] that was played on MTV2. In an interview with MTV Radio, Wade explained {{the process of making}} the music video, and said, [...] "We shot the video at this really cool place in Crenshaw, in L.A., that was a bowling alley upstairs and a roller rink downstairs. It had this really weird, retro vibe to it. When they were setting up the different sets, we'd have to stop every 10 seconds because a bowling league would walk in. It was the coolest thing. At night, we <b>got</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> our friends to come down." ...|$|E
500|$|Whereas metal guitarists' overdriven sound {{generally}} {{comes from}} a combination of overdriven amplifiers and distortion pedals, grunge guitarists typically <b>got</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> their [...] "dirty" [...] sound from overdrive and fuzz pedals, with the amp just used to make the sound louder. Grunge guitarists tended to use the Fender Twin Reverb and the Fender Champion 100 combo amps (Cobain used both of these amps). The use of pedals by grunge guitarists was a move away from the expensive, studio-grade rackmount effects units used in other rock genres. The positive way that grunge bands viewed stompbox pedals can be seen in Mudhoney's use of the name of two overdrive pedals, the Univox Super-Fuzz and the Big Muff, in the title of their [...] "debut EP Superfuzz Bigmuff". [...] In the song Mudride, the band's guitars were said to have [...] "growled malevolently" [...] through its [...] "Cro-magnon slog".|$|E

500|$|In 2008, Popular Mechanics named The Truman Show {{as one of}} the 10 most prophetic {{science fiction}} films. Journalist Erik Sofge argued that the story {{reflects}} the falseness of reality television. [...] "Truman simply lives, and the show's popularity is its straightforward voyeurism. And, like Big Brother, Survivor, and every other reality show on the air, none of his environment is actually real." [...] He deemed it an eerie coincidence that Big Brother made its debut a year after the film's release, and he also compared the film to the 2003 program The Joe Schmo Show: [...] "Unlike Truman, Matt Gould could see the cameras, but all of the other contestants were paid actors, playing the part of various reality-show stereotypes. While Matt eventually <b>got</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the prizes in the rigged contest, the show's central running joke was in the same existential ballpark as The Truman Show." [...] Weir declared, [...] "There has always been this question: Is the audience getting dumber? Or are we filmmakers patronizing them? Is this what they want? Or is this what we're giving them? But the public went to my film in large numbers. And that has to be encouraging." ...|$|E
500|$|Others saw no {{intentional}} snub of Colbert by the press. Responding to {{a question}} about why The Washington Posts article about the dinner did not go into any detail about Colbert's speech, Media Backtalk writer Howard Kurtz responded, [...] "The problem in part is one of deadline. The presses were already rolling by the time Colbert came on at 10:30, so the story had to be largely written by then." [...] Asked why television news favored Bush's performance over Colbert's, Elizabeth Fishman, an assistant dean at the Columbia School of Journalism and a former 60 Minutes producer, told MTV that the [...] "quick hit" [...] for television news shows would have been to use footage of Bush standing beside his impersonator. [...] "It's an easier set up for visual effect", she noted. Steve Scully, president of the White House Correspondents' Association (which hosted the dinner) and political editor of C-SPAN (which broadcast the dinner), scoffed at the whole idea of the press intentionally ignoring Colbert: [...] "Bush hit such a home run with Steve Bridges that he <b>got</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the coverage. I think that exceeded expectations. There was no right-wing conspiracy or left-wing conspiracy." [...] Time columnist Ana Marie Cox dismissed allegations of a deliberate media blackout, because Colbert's performance received coverage in The New York Times, The Washington Post, and the major wire services. Fellow commentator Kurtz concurred, noting that the video was carried on C-SPAN and was freely available online; he also played two clips on his own show. [...] "Apparently I didn't get the memo," [...] he said.|$|E

2500|$|Zelen’s {{colleague}} and successor (as Department Chair), biostatistics professor Nan Laird, recalled that “those {{first few years}} of integrating twelve new faculty members from Buffalo with half as many from Harvard were part of Marvin’s grand plan to make Harvard the nation's leading biostatistics department — which it is and has been for quite some time. It was an enormously exciting time when we were united in working towards a common goal.

2500|$|... "The {{guy who did}} {{the artwork}} for the first record, Jacob Escobedo, {{came up with that}} concept for the artwork , and in that moment we began talking about retro-futurism: so if you were to {{go back and look at}} the science fiction books {{released}} in the fifties and just how fascinating it is to see what people thought about the future. And for us, that kind of became like a theme. Brian's <b>got</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> this ancient gear - synthesisers from the time that synthesisers were being made - and they were incredibly futuristic at that time. And then as we got more into it ... the whole aesthetic started to evolve from there." ...|$|E

But, Magic Johnson was given a late night television show, because he’s famous and charming. Failed in 11 shows. Magic Johnson was given a head coaching job of the Lakers, because he’s famous and charming, failed in 16 games. Magic Johnson, not interesting as a broadcaster, given broadcasting opportunity after broadcasting opportunity, because he’s famous and charming. And now, he gets to run the entire Lakers organization because he’s famous and charming. That’s amazing. That’s amazing. He’s a very kind man, to be in his presence is to be awash in all the things people like about celebrity, he will make you feel special, but he wasn’t good at any of those jobs I just mentioned, and he <b>got</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> those jobs, bypassing a whole lot of people who are more qualified, because he’s famous and charming." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ulliott {{arrived at}} the 1997 World Series of Poker (WSOP) with $200,000, but lost it all on cash games and tournament buy-ins. He {{borrowed}} over $70,000 more, but lost this too, burning some bridges in the process. He scraped together a buy-in for the $2,000 pot limit Texas hold 'em event, where he reached heads-up against fellow Englishman Chris Truby. In the final hand, Ulliott <b>got</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> his money in the pot with an open-ended straight draw and flush draw against Truby's top set. Ulliott won with a straight on the river to claim $180,310 and his only WSOP bracelet. Whitaker jumped over the barricade {{to join in the}} celebrations. The press release the next day claimed he was lucky to draw out on Truby, but mathematically, Ulliott was a 54.5% favourite to win when the money went into the pot. After winning his bracelet, he had the nickname [...] "Devilfish" [...] engraved on it.|$|E
2500|$|During the 15th {{century and}} 16th century, [...] "uses" [...] or [...] "trusts" [...] were also {{employed}} {{to avoid the}} payment of feudal taxation. If a person died, the law stated a landlord was entitled to money before the land passed to an heir, and the landlord <b>got</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the property under the doctrine of escheat {{if there were no}} heirs. Transferring title to a group of people for common use could ensure this never happened, because if one person died he could be replaced, and it was unlikely for all to die at the same time. King Henry VIII saw that this deprived the Crown of revenue, and so in the Statute of Uses 1535 he attempted to prohibit uses, stipulating all land belonged in fact to the cestui que use. Henry VIII also increased the role of the Court of Star Chamber, a court with criminal jurisdiction that invented new rules as it thought fit, and often this was employed against political dissidents. However, when Henry VIII was gone, the Court of Chancery held that the Statute of Uses 1535 had no application where land was leased. People started entrusting property again for family legacies. Moreover, the primacy of equity over the common law soon was reasserted, and this time supported by King James I in 1615, in the Earl of Oxford's case. Due to its deep unpopularity the [...] "criminal equity" [...] jurisdiction was abolished by the Habeas Corpus Act 1640. Trusts grew more popular, and were tolerated by the Crown, as new sources of revenue from the mercantile exploits in the New World decreased the Crown's reliance on feudal dues. By the early 18th century, the use had formalised into a trust: where land was settled to be held by a trustee, for the benefit of another, the Courts of Chancery recognised the beneficiary as the true owner in equity.|$|E
