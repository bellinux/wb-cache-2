The respondents are all the 67 internal auditors Inspectorate of North Sulawesi Province.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of {{customer}} emotions on customer evaluation and behavior intention. The subjects {{used in this study}} were customers of a fashion shop in Sunchon South Korea. The questionnaires were conveniently sampled from July 2010 to August, 2010. Questionnaire data from 335 customers of a national brand were analyzed through a reliability analysis, factor analysis, and multiple regression analysis. The results of this study are as follows. First, emotions of customer were divided into 2 patterns, positive emotion and negative emotion. Second positive emotion have significant (+) <b>influences</b> <b>on</b> the trust and negative emotion have significant (-) <b>influences</b> <b>on</b> the trust. Third positive emotion have significant (+) <b>influences</b> <b>on</b> the customer orientation and negative emotion have significant (-) <b>influences</b> <b>on</b> the customer orientation. Forth, the emotions of customer have a considerable impact on the interaction intention. And the positive emotion have significant (+) <b>influences</b> <b>on</b> the word-of-mouth intention and negative emotion have not a considerable impact on it.

40|$|Most {{behavioural}} genetic studies {{focus on}} genetic and environmental <b>influences</b> <b>on</b> inter-individual phenotypic differences at the population level. The growing collection of intensive longitudinal data {{in social and}} behavioural science offers {{a unique opportunity to}} examine genetic and environmental <b>influences</b> <b>on</b> intra-individual phenotypic variability at the individual level. The current study introduces a novel idiographic approach and one novel method to investigate genetic and environmental <b>influences</b> <b>on</b> intra-individual variability by a simple empirical demonstration. Person-specific non-shared environmental <b>influences</b> <b>on</b> intra-individual variability of daily school feelings were estimated using time series data from twenty-one pairs of monozygotic twins (age = 10 years, 16 female pairs) over two consecutive weeks. Results showed substantial inter-individual heterogeneity in person- specific non-shared environmental influences. The current study represents a first step in investigating environmental <b>influences</b> <b>on</b> intra-individual variability with an idiographic approach, and provides implications for future behavioural genetic studies to examine developmental processes from a microscopic angle...|$|R
40|$|Extending {{previous}} research on the genetic underpinnings of entrepreneurship, we investigate {{gender differences in the}} genetic <b>influences</b> <b>on</b> the tendency of people to become entrepreneurs. We also examined two mediating variables through which genetic factors may impact this tendency: extraversion and neuroticism. Based on 1285 pairs of identical twins (449 male and 836 female pairs) and 849 pairs of same-sex fraternal twins (283 male and 566 female pairs), we found that females have a strong genetic influence and zero shared-environmental <b>influences</b> <b>on</b> their tendency to become entrepreneurs. In contrast, males show zero genetic influence, but a large shared-environmental influence. Extraversion and neuroticism mediate the genetic <b>influences</b> <b>on</b> women's tendency to become entrepreneurs, whereas extraversion mediates shared-environmental <b>influences</b> <b>on</b> men's tendency to become entrepreneurs. We discuss this sharp difference in genetic <b>influences</b> <b>on</b> entrepreneurship across gender groups and highlight the different challenges that men and women face in their entrepreneurial endeavors.

5|$|Cantillon {{is one of}} the few economists {{cited by}} Adam Smith, who {{directly}} borrows Cantillon's sustenance theory of wages. Large sections of Smith's economic theory were possibly directly influenced by Cantillon, although in many respects Adam Smith advanced well beyond the scope of Cantillon. Some economic historians have argued that Adam Smith provided little of value from his own intellect, notably Schumpeter and Rothbard. In any case, through his <b>influence</b> <b>on</b> Adam Smith and the physiocrats, Cantillon was quite possibly the pre-classical economist who contributed most to the ideas of the classical school. Illustrative of this was Cantillon's <b>influence</b> <b>on</b> Say, which is noticeable in the methodology employed in the latter's Treatise on Political Economy.|$|E
