40|$|GTA: San Andreas” is {{an action}} {{adventure}} video game developed by Rockstar North {{and published by}} Rockstar Game. The game’s main storyline represents racial issues in the United States especially the African-American stereotypes. The {{purpose of this study}} is to analyze the gameplay, storyline, and cutscene of the game. The study uses ergodic, textual, and contextual theories to analyze the data and library research to compile the data. Library research is used to get literary and stereotype theories. There are five stereotypes showed in this game, namely, African-Americans have savage behaviour; African-Americans are poor people who live in ghettos; African-Americans tend to love hip-hop as well as raps music;African-Americans use <b>ebonic</b> language; and African-American males love to wear saggy pants or baggy clothes...|$|R
500|$|Barret's {{comparisons}} to Mr. T {{in the media}} has resulted in both praise and criticism, {{with most of the}} criticism accusing the character of serving as a negative racial stereotype of African Americans. IGN argued in favor of this point, citing his use of [...] "stilted slang," [...] and stating that the character stands out amongst the cast because [...] "his dialog is written as if it was run through a broken <b>ebonic</b> translator," [...] further noting a trend in Japanese games to apply such dialogue to characters based on their skin color. Journalist Jeremy Parish agreed that the character was racist, although he argued that cultural gaps between Japan and the United States, plus the lack of American translators for Final Fantasy VII may have been contributing factors, arguing that the likeness between Barret and Mr. T was possibly an attempt to make a character that appealed to Americans, as the actor did.|$|R
2500|$|African American Vernacular English (AAVE), {{also called}} African American English (AAE), or less {{precisely}} Black English, Black Vernacular, Black English Vernacular (BEV), or Black Vernacular English (BVE), is a variety (dialect, ethnolect and sociolect) of American English, spoken by urban working-class and (largely [...] ) middle-class African Americans. It is sometimes colloquially {{referred to as}} <b>Ebonics,</b> a term that is avoided by linguists because of its other meanings and connotations.|$|E
2500|$|National {{attitudes towards}} AAVE were {{revisited}} when a controversial resolution from the Oakland (California) school board (Oakland Unified School District) on December 18, 1996, called for [...] "Ebonics" [...] {{to be recognized}} as a language of African Americans. In fact, <b>ebonics</b> would be classified as a [...] "second language". The proposal was to implement a program similar to the Language Development Program for African American Students (LDPAAS) in Los Angeles, which began in 1988 and uses methods from the SESD programs mentioned above.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{interpretations of}} the {{controversial}} issues in the resolution include the idea that <b>Ebonics</b> is not a vernacular or dialect of English, {{that it is a}} separate language; a member of the African language family; that African Americans particular language and their dialects; that speakers of <b>Ebonics</b> should qualify for federally funded programs traditionally restricted to bilingual populations; and that students would be taught American Standard English via <b>Ebonics.</b> The Rev. Jesse Jackson condemned the resolution, saying [...] "I understand the attempt to reach out to these children, but this is an unacceptable surrender, borderlining on disgrace." [...] His comments were seconded by former Secretary of Education William Bennett, former New York governor Mario Cuomo, and Senator Joe Lieberman. [...] Jackson would later reverse his position, attributing his initial opposition to a misunderstanding of the school district's proposal. He said, [...] "They're not trying to teach Black English as a standard language. They're looking for tools to teach children standard English so they might be competitive." ...|$|E
5000|$|A two-year-old term {{created by}} a group of black scholars, <b>Ebonics</b> may be defined as [...] "the {{linguistic}} and paralinguistic features which on a concentric continuum represent the communicative competence of the West African, Caribbean, and United States slave descendants of African origin. It includes the various idioms, patois, argots, idiolects, and social dialects of black people" [...] especially those who have adapted to colonial circumstances. <b>Ebonics</b> derives its form from ebony (black) and phonics (sound, the study of sound) and refers {{to the study of the}} language of black people in all its cultural uniqueness.|$|E

5000|$|Further, these {{suggestions}} ask Black families {{and students to}} adapt in order to fit a Eurocentric system. Some researchers have begun to push back, and challenge schools to be more inclusive of activities and classroom setups that promote and support Blackness and Black Identities,. [...] In Fordham's research [...] "Dissin' [...] "the Standard": <b>Ebonics</b> as Guerrilla Warfare at Capital High", Fordham discusses how Black students have taken on <b>Ebonics</b> as the Standard language, and treat Standard English as a vernacular dialect. Fordham implicates that using <b>Ebonics</b> or standard English is a choice. She asserts that many students don't speak [...] "standard english" [...] because, either consciously or unconsciously, they recognize that forcing standard English is an institutionalized convention that [...] "marginalizes and stigmatizes the Black self." [...] Therefore, policies based off the common assumption that Black students can't speak [...] "standard english" [...] will never work, because they force students to perpetuate the dehumanization that occurs by devaluing Black language. [...] Similarly, policies that focus on getting Black students to perform more behaviors associated with Whiteness will be unsuccessful {{to the extent they}} ask Black students and Black families to adopt the behaviors {{of the people who have}} historically oppressed them.|$|E

50|$|African American Vernacular English (AAVE), {{also known}} as <b>Ebonics,</b> is a variety of English spoken by many African Americans, in both rural and urban areas.

5000|$|In 1996 with Quan as president, {{the school}} board instituted a program using Standard English Program {{strategies}} to teach standard English to African American students. The move created national news with the perception Oakland schools were teaching students [...] "Ebonics" [...] because there was discussion about <b>Ebonics</b> {{being used as a}} teaching tool.|$|E
5000|$|The term became {{widely known}} in the United States due to a {{controversy}} over {{a decision by the}} Oakland School Board to denote and recognize the primary language (or sociolect or ethnolect) of African American children attending school, and to thereby acquire budgeted funds to facilitate the teaching of standard English. Thereafter, the term <b>Ebonics</b> became popularized, though {{as little more than a}} synonym for African American Vernacular English, perhaps differing in the emphasis on its claimed African roots and independence from English. The term is linked with the nationally discussed controversy over the decision by the Oakland School Board, which adopted a resolution to teach children [...] "standard American English" [...] through a specific program of respect for students' home language and tutoring in the [...] "code switching" [...] required to use both standard English and <b>Ebonics.</b>|$|E
50|$|Other {{writers have}} since {{emphasized}} how the term represents {{a view of}} the language of Black people as African rather than European. The term was not obviously popular even among those who agreed with the reason for coining it.
