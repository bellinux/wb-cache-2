500|$|A {{music video}} {{for the song}} {{directed}} by Cameron Duddy and Mars was released on October 15, 2012. The concept of the video shows Mars {{having a good time}} with his bandmates, doing things like smoking, drinking beer and playing games. He is also seen singing the song with his band at a club. The video has a vintage style reminiscent of VHS tapes. Mars explained to MTV News, [...] "The concept is just old-fashioned fun. No story line, it's not me singing to a girl, you get a good sense of what you're going to get live... It's very VHS-y. I love that man, <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> back to my childhood, when the tracking is off and the color is off, there's a beauty in that. You'd have to stand by the TV with, like, aluminum foil all over you." ...|$|E
500|$|In Charlotte, Benjamin {{stayed in}} the home of a Jewish {{merchant}} as surrender negotiations dragged. [...] Here, Benjamin abandoned Davis's plan to fight on, telling him and the Cabinet that the cause was hopeless. [...] When negotiations failed, Benjamin was part of the shrunken remnant of associates that moved on with Davis. The party reached Abbeville, South Carolina on May 2, and Benjamin told Davis that he wanted to separate from the presidential party temporarily, and go to the Bahamas to be able to send instructions to foreign agents before rejoining Davis in Texas. According to historian William C. Davis, [...] "the pragmatic Secretary of State almost certainly never had any intention of returning to the South once gone". When he bade John Reagan goodbye, the postmaster general asked where Benjamin was going. [...] "To the farthest place from the United States, if <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> to the middle of China." ...|$|E

500|$|The Luftwaffe {{launched}} a major attack against key Maltese airfields at dawn on 20 March. Leggo, {{who had not}} slept for over 24hours, returned to the airfield {{in the early hours}} having spent the night with a girlfriend. As the German planes approached he was ordered to prepare to fly. Plagis attempted to stop his friend from going, but Leggo insisted on flying, and took off at 08:05 as {{part of a group of}} four Spitfires and 12 Hurricanes aiming to intercept a squadron of Messerschmitt Bf 109s. He was soon seen to be flying poorly. A German pilot noticed this and attacked Leggo from close range, seriously damaging his aircraft and forcing him to bale out. Another Bf 109 then swooped and either fired at Leggo or collapsed his parachute with its slipstream, causing him to fall to his death. When Plagis learned what had happened, he was inconsolable, holding himself responsible. In his journal, he vowed to [...] "shoot down ten for Doug—I will too, if <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> a lifetime".|$|E
2500|$|Magnani was mystically {{inclined}} and consulted astrologers, {{as well as}} {{believing in}} numerology. She also claimed to be clairvoyant. She ate and drank very little and could subsist for long periods on nothing more than black coffee and cigarettes. However, these habits often affected her sleep: [...] "My nights are appalling," [...] she said. [...] "I wake up {{in a state of}} nerves and <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> hours to get back in touch with reality." [...] Perhaps her strangest quirk was her love of defleaing street kittens with her thumbnails.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Binchy [...] "suffered {{a health}} crisis {{related to a}} heart condition", which {{inspired}} her to write Heart and Soul. The book about (what Binchy terms) [...] "a heart failure clinic" [...] in Dublin and the people involved with it, reflects many of her own experiences and observations in the hospital. Towards {{the end of her}} life, Binchy had the following message on her official website: [...] "My health isn't so good these days and I can't travel around to meet people the way I used to. But I'm always delighted to hear from readers, even if <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> a while to reply." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the 1983 season, Boros gained {{note for}} his {{pioneering}} use of [...] "sabermetrics" [...] {{and a computer}} to help guide his managerial decisions. In his book on baseball innovations, historian Peter Morris wrote that Boros was [...] "the first manager to make extensive use of computers in his decision-making process." [...] After every game, Boros had pitch-by-pitch data fed into a mainframe computer at Digital Equipment Corporation in Philadelphia. He would retrieve the data before the next game, analyzing how each pitcher and hitter matched up. Jay Alves, a [...] "sabermetrician" [...] hired by Boros to run the computer system, later recalled: [...] "With Steve, we tracked (on paper) virtually every pitch and where it was hit. Then I'd type it into the computer after the game, but that would {{take a couple of}} hours. That's how long <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> to do it with pencil and paper." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the 1937 season, Clark {{finished}} {{among the}} NFL leaders with five rushing touchdowns (first), 4.9 yards per rushing attempt (second), 468 rushing yards (fourth), and 45 points scored (fourth). For the Lions' 1937 Thanksgiving Day {{game against the}} Bears, the team held a [...] "Dutch Clark Day". Before a capacity crowd of 26,000, the Lions presented Clark with an automobile, and his wife received a platinum wrist watch set with diamonds. After the game, a punishing loss, Clark announced his retirement as a player, saying: [...] "I'm too old. Look how long <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> to get undressed." [...] Tod Rockwell of the Detroit Free Press wrote that, as Clark announced his retirement, he was [...] "bruised from head to foot", his left hand was [...] "swollen double its normal size", there were [...] "welts on his legs, a lump over one eye, and a belt on the mouth had split open his lips in several places." ...|$|E
2500|$|Enya is {{the sole}} {{composer}} of the music on The Memory of Trees and co-arranged them with Nicky. It is her first album not to feature guest musicians. In addition to the vocals, piano {{and an array of}} keyboards and synthesisers which defined her sound, Enya plays the violin, cello, and percussion instruments. Her method of songwriting has deviated little since the start of her career, which starts by entering the studio and forgetting about past successes. Ideas are then be put on tape as either a vocal or a piano melody. [...] "Usually what happens is the first note, the second note, and <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> on a journey and I just go along with it." [...] When a collection of ideas have been recorded Enya presents them to Nicky, starting discussions on how to develop them further into songs. Roma will then work on a lyric if they feel the song would suit one.|$|E

2500|$|... "Stay" [...] is a pop ballad that {{consists}} of piano and guitar instrumentation. It is written in the key of A minor, having the chord progression of C-Dm-Am-F. The song has a moderate tempo of 112 beats per minute. Rihanna's vocal range in the song ranges from the low note of A3 to the high note of E5. Greg Kot for the Chicago Tribune described the song as being [...] "stripped-bare". The lyrics revolve around [...] "failing to resist true love", according to Dan Martin for NME, as Rihanna sings [...] "Funny, you're the broken one/ But I'm {{the only one who}} needed saving." [...] According to Jocelyn Vena for MTV, Rihanna [...] "punctuates the emotions of the track" [...] on the lyric [...] "It's not much of a life you're living/ It's not just something you take [...] given." [...] Rihanna also makes a plea to her lover, singing [...] "'Round and around and around and around we go/ Now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know/ Not really sure how to feel about it/ Something in the way you move/ Makes me feel like I can't live without you/ <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> all the way/ I want you to stay." [...] Lewis Corner for Digital Spy wrote that Rihanna's vocals glow over the simple yet effective piano riffs.|$|E
