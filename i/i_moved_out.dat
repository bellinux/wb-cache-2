The two had a falling out and Jay-Ru died before the two {{had a chance to}} reconcile. [...] "Me and Jay-Ru was still close partners," [...] T.I. explained. [...] "We lived together, we was in the streets hustling together. I had got involved with my older son's mom at the time. <b>I</b> <b>moved</b> <b>out</b> of the apartment into my own spot with her. Me and Jay-Ru fell out about that it took a toll on me. To this day I still think about him, especially when I see his daughter",T.I. stated. According to T. I. himself, [...] securing Jamie Foxx on piano wasn't too tough of a task. [...] "I sent the word I wanted him to get on it and he got on it the next day. [...] I was thinking about everybody who could play the piano as well as sing, and Jamie {{was at the top of}} my list". [...] T. I. added that he was just about done with his album, but he's not ruling out a last-minute guest appearance by Jay-Z, who was supposed to get on a record called [...] "Good Life", [...] but due to scheduling conflicts he didn't make it and Common took his place. The two hooked up while both were in Los Angeles for the Grammys. T.I. would also have recording sessions for the album with record Producers Just Blaze, Keith Mack, Travis Barker, The Neptunes, Kevin [...] "Khao" [...] Cates, Nick [...] "Fury" [...] Loftin and Tony Galvin.|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Cadurcis {{went into}} an hysterical rage; then, {{suddenly}} jumping up, she rushed at her son. Lord Cadurcis {{took up a}} position behind the table, but the sportive and mocking air which he generally instinctively assumed on these occasions, and which, while it irritated his mother more, was in reality affected by the boy from a sort of nervous desire of preventing these dreadful exposures from assuming a too tragic tone, did not characterise his countenance on the present occasion; on the contrary, it was pale, but composed and very serious. Mrs. Cadurcis, after one or two ineffectual attempts to catch him, paused and panted for breath. He took advantage of this momentary cessation, and spoke thus, 'Mother, I am in no humour for frolics. <b>I</b> <b>moved</b> <b>out</b> of your way {{that you might not}} strike me, because I have made up my mind that, if you ever strike me again, I will live with you no longer. Now, I have given you warning; do what you please; I shall sit down in this chair, and not move. If you strike me, you know the consequences.' So saying, his lordship resumed his chair.|$|E
60|$|Finally the 29th of March came, and {{fortunately}} there {{having been a}} few days free from rain, {{the surface of the}} ground was dry, giving indications that the time had come when we could move. On that date <b>I</b> <b>moved</b> <b>out</b> with all the army available after leaving sufficient force to hold the line about Petersburg. It soon set in raining again however, and {{in a very short time}} the roads became practically impassable for teams, and almost so for cavalry. Sometimes a horse or mule would be standing apparently on firm ground, when all at once one foot would sink, and as he commenced scrambling to catch himself all his feet would sink and he would have to be drawn by hand out of the quicksands so common in that part of Virginia and other southern States. It became necessary therefore to build corduroy roads every foot of the way as we advanced, to move our artillery upon. The army had become so accustomed to this kind of work, and were so well prepared for it, that it was done very rapidly. The next day, March 30th, we had made sufficient progress to the south-west to warrant me in starting Sheridan with his cavalry over by Dinwiddie with instructions to then come up by the road leading north-west to Five Forks, thus menacing the right of Lee's line.|$|E

5000|$|The {{album was}} co-produced by Bowie and Tony Visconti, with {{contributions}} from Brian Eno. As a recovering cocaine addict, Bowie's songwriting on Low dealt with difficult issues: [...] "There's oodles {{of pain in}} the Low album. That was my first attempt to kick cocaine, so that was {{an awful lot of}} pain. And I moved to Berlin to do it. <b>I</b> <b>moved</b> <b>out</b> of the coke centre of the world Los Angeles, where Station to Station into the smack centre of the world.

5000|$|The album Low (1977) was {{recorded}} as Bowie grappled with difficult personal issues, including a troubled marriage and drug dependence: [...] "There's oodles {{of pain in}} the Low album. That was my first attempt to kick cocaine, so that was {{an awful lot of}} pain. And I moved to Berlin to do it. <b>I</b> <b>moved</b> <b>out</b> of the coke centre of the world Los Angeles into the smack centre of the world. Thankfully, I didn't have a feeling for smack, so it wasn't a threat". Visconti contended that the title was partly a reference to Bowie's [...] "low" [...] moods during the album's writing and recording. The album marked a movement for Bowie into electronic and ambient music. Side one of the album contained short, direct avant-pop song-fragments; side two comprised longer, mostly instrumental tracks. Often incorrectly given credit as Lows producer, Eno was responsible for {{a good deal of the}} direction and composition of the second side of the album and wrote the theme and instrumentation for [...] "Warszawa" [...] while Bowie was in Paris attending court hearings against his former manager. Partly influenced by the Krautrock sound of Kraftwerk and Neu!, Low evinced a move away from narration in Bowie's songwriting to a more abstract musical form in which lyrics were sporadic and optional.|$|E

All of a sudden my whole life was up in smoke. James Merceron the song's impact The Shins were not truly a band when James Mercer composed the song, {{and the idea of}} making music his career seemed uncertain. The song's creation was partially a reaction to the music scene in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the band's hometown, which Mercer described as [...] "macho, really heavy, and aggressive." [...] He characterized it as a punk rock-esque move akin to giving the finger to the entire town. The song was born out of frustration regarding his personal life and future. [...] "It's definitely a moment in my life, that sort of angst and confusion about what my future was going to be," [...] he remarked. He described it as a [...] "Saturn return" [...] period of his life, in which he felt he could not relate to anyone in his hometown and his life there had become depressing. He had become a [...] "hermit" [...] working on the band's debut album, Oh, Inverted World, and had lost interest in partying with friends. The line [...] "Gold teeth and a curse for this town" [...] refers to his songwriting talent and his feelings on Albuquerque.|$|E

Following the {{completion}} of their debut single release, [...] "When I Goose-Step", the Shins embarked on a tour with Modest Mouse. Mercer became a [...] "hermit" [...] crafting {{what would become the}} group's debut album, and became depressed with his life in Albuquerque. Friends of the band, including Zeke Howard from Love As Laughter and Isaac Brock from Modest Mouse sent record labels cassette demos of the band's songs. Mercer sent a demo to Sub Pop Records in Seattle, Washington, and label co-founder Jonathan Poneman caught a concert in San Francisco while the band was on tour with Modest Mouse. He offered the band a one-off single deal, and the Shins' second single, [...] "New Slang", was included as part of their Single-of-the-Month series, issuing a 7" [...] single to fan club members in February 2001. Positive press for [...] "New Slang" [...] made the group's debut album one of the most anticipated indie rock albums of 2001, and Sub Pop signed the band in full.

5000|$|Originally {{a gospel}} singer, with the Heritage Singers and others, he was {{featured}} on the pop-classical album Handel's Messiah - A Soulful Celebration in 1993, singing a contemporary version of [...] "Every Valley Shall Be Exalted". His first job after college in Alabama was touring with a group that sang hundreds of shows in churches over a two-year period. [...] In the mid-1990s, he toured as backup vocalist for Twila Paris. In 1996, he released his debut self-titled album, for which he wrote or co-wrote eight of the eleven songs, and earned a nomination for Best R&B Album at the 1996 Nashville Music Awards. That year, he opened on tour for Mark Lowry, {{and was one of}} several featured singers in the musical showcase Emmanuel, a national tour put together by Nashville producer Norman Miller. The tour spawned an album, which won a GMA Dove Award in 1998 for Special Event Album of the Year. He did mostly gospel until 1998 when he signed with a small music label. The label was bought out by a large corporation and Willis took that as a cue to move on. During this time he also worked to resolve the [...] "angst" [...] from being closeted about his sexuality, [...] "I always felt like God really understood—but that wasn't the message I was receiving in the church. So, when <b>I</b> <b>moved</b> <b>out</b> on my own I really internalized that message that God makes us who we are and that it's up to us to embrace that or not. I chose to embrace all those things as freedom, and that freedom begat the freedom I experience now." [...] He cites his internalized struggle as important to his transitioning out of gospel music,"I think there's this unspoken denial that you go through in gospel—maybe so in other musical art forms too—but I just felt for me it just wasn't easy to keep perpetuating that." [...] However, on June 2, 2014 Willis married his best friend of 25 years Jacqueline Leiske.|$|E
