5000|$|It's a punt. I mean, it's {{one more}} {{occasion}} where Congress has basically punted, kicked the can down the road, use what metaphor you want. It cuts $21 {{billion out of}} the 2012 budget, {{which is the only}} budget over which this Congress actually has any authority ... The <b>Democrats</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> no cuts to entitlements. The Republicans are saying no taxes. That's great except we all know the only solution to our long-term debt problem is cuts in entitlements and new taxes.|$|E
5000|$|Wasserman Schultz is a {{supporter}} of Israel. She defended her party against suggestions that the <b>Democrats</b> <b>are</b> anti-Israel, <b>saying</b> [...] "I would stack up the Democratic caucus's position on the support for Israel against the Republican caucus's {{any day of the}} week and be much more confident—and the Jewish community should be much more confident—in the Democrats' stewardship of Israel than the Republicans, especially if you compare the underlying reasons for both groups' support for Israel. The very far right group of Republicans' interest in Israel is not because they are so supportive of there being a Jewish state and making sure that Jews have a place that we can call home. It has references to Armageddon and biblical references that are more their interest. So I would encourage members of the Jewish community to put their faith in Democrats, because our support for Israel is generally for the right reasons." ...|$|R
500|$|The Eiland-Hall {{response}} brief cited {{a clip of}} Beck interviewing United States Congressman Keith Ellison, a Muslim from Minnesota. Beck had stated to U.S. Representative Ellison, [...] "No {{offense and}} I know Muslims, I like Muslims, I've been to mosques, I really don't think Islam is a religion of evil. I think it's being hijacked, quite frankly. With that being said, you <b>are</b> a <b>Democrat.</b> You <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> let's cut and run. And I have to tell you, I have been nervous about this interview because what I feel like <b>saying</b> <b>is,</b> sir, {{prove to me that}} you are not working with our enemies. And I know you’re not. I’m not accusing you of being an enemy. But that’s the way I feel, and I think a lot of Americans will feel that way." [...] It was argued that this was an example of Beck's interview style in which he challenged his guests to prove a negative. Randazza concluded Beck's rhetorical style was similar to Gottfried's, simply devoid of comedic intent.|$|R
