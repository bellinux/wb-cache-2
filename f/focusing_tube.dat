40|$|Abrasive {{waterjet}} (AWJ) cutting is a {{machining process}} to cut {{wide range of}} materials from soft materials such as rubber, leather to hard materials such as metals {{by means of a}} high-velocity slurry jet, formed as a result of injecting abrasive particles into a waterjet. The machining action is the result of these particles impacting against a workpiece with a high velocity. Conventional AWJ equipments generate water pressures up to 400 MPa (= 4000 bar = 58000 psi) and use orifices whose diameters are in the range of 0. 08 mm to 1 mm to generate plain waterjet. The abrasive particles of sizes 0. 07 mm to 0. 36 mm in diameter entrain to the jet former with air and mix with the waterjet in the mixing chamber to form the three phase slurry jet. The abrasive particles are accelerated and focused in the <b>focusing</b> <b>tube.</b> The width of the <b>focusing</b> <b>tube</b> determines the cutting width which is in the range of 0. 5 mm to 1. 5 mm in diameter. This study investigates the applicability and the performance of waterjet (WJ) and AWJcutting process beyond 400 MPa water pressure, which is called ultra-high pressures during the study. One of the objectives is to expand the application domain of the process. With higher water pressure, plain WJ is capable of cutting harder materials and it is possible to cut intricate details with AWJ due to the availability of high energy density with small orifices. Moreover, reduction in cutting costs is expected as a result of higher feed speeds or reduced abrasive consumption. The initial focus of the research is to provide guidelines to develop a reliable AWJ cutting system above 400 MPa. It was shown that the plastic deformation takes place at the thick walled cylinders subjected to internal pressure of more than 700 MPa with the current types of materials that are generally used in high pressure components. Therefore, imposing compressive residual stress to the bore of the cylinder is necessary for the parts such as high pressure intensifier cylinder where plastic deformation is unacceptable. Autofrettage and multi layer construction are the two techniques to create residual stresses in the cylinder. An optimum autofrettage pressure exists due to the Bauschinger effect. Therefore, a multi layer cylinder construction provides cylinders with higher pressure capacity. A simplified model for predicting the pressure output for double acting pressure intensifiers is presented after the design considerations for thick walled cylinders in order to estimate the required attenuator volume and the high pressure cylinder dimensions to limit the pressure fluctuations. The model is in good agreement with the pressure measurements. The energy conversions and the related efficiencies during the AWJ formation process provide a perspective to the performance of the process. Energy density of the plain and abrasive waterjet is defined to correlate with the cutting performance. Reducing the <b>focusing</b> <b>tube</b> diameter and increasing the water pressure are the most beneficial methods to increase the energy density. Other methods such as increasing the orifice diameter or reducing the feed speed are in conflict with cutting intricate details and economical considerations. With the insight gained at the previous step, the performances of plain and abrasive waterjet are evaluated. The increase in pressure results in a more scattered jet. A diverted jet generates wider cuts with wider damaged zones and rounded edges in WJ cutting. In AWJ cutting, it accelerates the wear of the entry region of the focusing nozzle. The experiments show that the length and diameter of upstream tube {{play an important role in}} jet quality. The turbulences in the flow are reduced in the upstream tube. It should be sufficiently large to make the flow laminar. Moreover, when the streamlines are guided towards the orifice with a conical seal, the resultant jet disintegrates later. After the quality of the jet is ensured, the cutting performance tests are conducted. The maximum feed rate increases more than the hydraulic power of the waterjet which shows that increasing the pressure leads to a more power efficient process. Moreover, at the same hydraulic power, the smaller jets perform better. On the other hand, the increase in depth of cut with pressure is directly proportional with the hydraulic power. It is proposed that the depth of cut is directly proportional with the energy density of the jet. However, at the low feed rates the relation is no longer linear. Therefore, the feed rate term of the energy density equation is modified to predict the depth of cut. Due to the cutting mechanism of the plain waterjet, the surface quality is poor with burrs in the case of metals and fiber damages in the case of composite materials. Therefore, plain waterjet cutting is suitable for separating instead of precision cutting of metal sheets and composites. The mixing and acceleration of the particles with a waterjet determine the cutting ability of AWJ. It becomes less efficient at high abrasive loads. The momentum from the plain waterjet to the abrasives transfers more efficient with the increase in pressure at the same abrasive load ratio. The efficiency of power transferred from the water to the abrasives decreases when the abrasive load ratio exceeds 0. 3 for low <b>focusing</b> <b>tube</b> to orifice diameter (df / do) ratios and 0. 4 for high df /do ratio. The optimum abrasive flow rate does not depend on pressure. As it was in the plain waterjet, the energy density of the jet correlates well with the cutting ability of the jet. The linear relation between these parameters becomes non-linear at high energy densities due to the increased energy losses at longer traveling lengths through the material at higher depths of cut. The final consideration of this study is the economical aspects of ultra-high pressure AWJ cutting. The cost advantage depends on the increase of the cost of the pump, the maintenance and the life of the consumables with the pressure increase. The pressure increase is cost effective if the investment costs and maintenance costs are below certain values. If several engineering issues such as the lifetimes of the critical components and the availability of wear resistant sufficiently long focusing tubes are solved, the ultra-high abrasive waterjet cutting can be implemented successfully to industrial applications.
