40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore how social workers {{interpret}} the part of the Swedish social services act that regulates each municipality’s responsibility of the people staying in it. The study’s general methodological approach connects to sociology of law. The research questions were: (1) What factors are considered important by the social workers <b>in</b> <b>assessments</b> of responsible municipality? (2) Are there variations <b>in</b> the <b>assessments</b> of responsible municipality and in that case; how can the variations be explained? (3) What discretion do the social workers consider that they have <b>in</b> <b>assessments</b> of responsible municipality? Previous studies have found considerable differences in professional social work <b>assessments</b> <b>in</b> Sweden. 69 social workers completed a questionnaire which included two vignettes. The selection maintained the emergency social services for well above 4 million citizens. Many factors were considered important <b>in</b> <b>assessments</b> of responsible municipality; the most prominent of those was the physical presence in the municipality. Variations appeared especially regarding long-term decisions and could partially be explained by which factors were considered important. The law that regulates the area of interest is a detailed legislation. However, some explanation could be found in Lipskys (2010) theory of Street-level bureaucracy...|$|R

Since this seminal article was published, a wide range of research has been published in the area of functional analyses of aberrant behaviors.

25|$|Since the 1970s, {{clinical}} psychology has continued growing into a robust profession and academic field of study. Although {{the exact number}} of practicing clinical psychologists is unknown, it is estimated that between 1974 and 1990, the number in the U.S. grew from 20,000 to 63,000. Clinical psychologists continue to be experts <b>in</b> <b>assessment</b> and psychotherapy while expanding their focus to address issues of gerontology, sports, and the criminal justice system to name a few. One important field is health psychology, the fastest-growing employment setting for clinical psychologists in the past decade. Other major changes include the impact of managed care on mental health care; an increasing realization of the importance of knowledge relating to multicultural and diverse populations; and emerging privileges to prescribe psychotropic medication.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{during the}} early 1960s, there were several scandals in California {{involving}} county assessors. These assessors were found rewarding friends and allies with artificially low assessments, with tax bills to match. These scandals led {{to the passage of}} AB 80 in 1966, which imposed standards to hold assessments to market value. The return to market value in the wake of AB 80 could easily represent a mid-double-digit percentage increase <b>in</b> <b>assessment</b> for many homeowners. As a result, a large number of California homeowners experienced an immediate and drastic rise in valuation, simultaneous with rising tax rates on that assessed value, only to be told that the taxed monies would be redistributed to distant communities. The ensuing anger started to form into a backlash against property taxes which coalesced around Howard Jarvis, a former newspaperman and appliance manufacturer, turned taxpayer activist in retirement.|$|E

25|$|After {{the club}} failed to qualify to Europe {{at the end}} of 2009–10 Serie A, as well as lack of player profit, Fiorentina {{turnover}} was decreased from €140,040,713 in 2009 to just €79,854,928, despite the wage bill also falling, la Viola still made a net loss of €9,604,353. In the 2011 financial year, the turnover slipped to €67,076,953, as the club's lack of capital gains from selling players and 2010 financial year still included the instalments from UEFA for participating 2009–10 UEFA Europa League. Furthermore, the gate income had dropped from €11,070,385 to €7,541,260. The wage bill did not fall much and in reverse the amortisation of transfer fee had sightly increased due to new signings. La Viola had savings in other costs but counter-weighted by huge €11,747,668 write-down for departed players, due to D'Agostino, Frey and Mutu, but the former would counter-weight by co-ownership financial income, which all made the operating cost remained high as worse as last year. Moreover, in 2010 the result was boosted by acquiring the asset from subsidiary (related to AC Fiorentina) and the re-valuation of its value in separate balance sheet. If deducting that income (€14,737,855), 2010 financial year was net loss 24,342,208 and 2011 result was worse with €8,131,876 only in separate balance sheet. In 2012, the club benefited from the sales of Matija Nastasić and Valon Behrami, followed by Stevan Jovetić and Adem Ljajić in 2013. In 2014, due to €28.4million drop from the windfall profit of selling players, the club recorded their worst financial results since re-foundation, despite the fact the club maintained the same level of windfall profit, the result was still worse than in 2013. Moreover, Fiorentina also revealed that the club had a relevant football net income of minus €19.5million in the first assessment period of UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations in the 2013–14 season (in May 2014). (aggregate of 2012 and 2013 results), which within the limit of minus €45million, as well as minus €25.5million <b>in</b> <b>assessment</b> period 2014–15 (aggregate of 2012, 2013 and 2014 results). However, as the limit was reduced to minus €30million <b>in</b> <b>assessment</b> period 2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017–18 season, the club had to achieve a relevant net income of positive €5.6million in 2015 financial year. La Viola sold Juan Cuadrado to Chelsea in January 2015 for €30million fee, to make the club eligible to 2016–17 edition of UEFA competitions.|$|E
500|$|RAD {{arises from}} {{a failure to}} form normal {{attachments}} to primary caregivers in early childhood. Such a failure could result from severe early experiences of neglect, abuse, abrupt separation from caregivers {{between the ages of}} six months and three years, frequent change of caregivers, or a lack of caregiver responsiveness to a child's communicative efforts. Not all, or even a majority of such experiences, result in the disorder. It is differentiated from pervasive developmental disorder or developmental delay and from possibly comorbid conditions such as intellectual disability, all of which can affect attachment behavior.
