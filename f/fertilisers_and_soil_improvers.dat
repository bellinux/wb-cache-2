40|$|The {{increased}} {{consumption of}} meat (including poultry) observed {{over the last}} decade has led to the intensification of its production. With the production increase, the amount of generated waste also increases. Appropriate disposal of waste from the meat industry will significantly reduce the amount of such waste and its negative impact on the environment. The paper presents a method for the thermal neutralisation of feathers, poultry litter and meat and bone meal (MBM). Waste incineration was carried out in a stationary electric furnace, at a temperature varying in the range of 600 – 900 °C. The resulting ashes were characterised by a high percentage of phosphorus (30 – 170 g/kg ash), calcium (20 – 360 g/kg ash) and other valuable macro- and micronutrients like copper, iron, manganese and zinc. The ashes produced during the thermal treatment are safe in terms of sanitary and can be used as additives enriching the <b>fertilisers</b> <b>and</b> <b>soil</b> <b>improvers.</b> Web of Science 4934533...|$|E
40|$|A {{range of}} wastes {{representative}} of materials currently applied, or with future {{potential to be}} applied, to agricultural land in the UK as <b>fertilisers</b> <b>and</b> <b>soil</b> <b>improvers</b> or used as animal bedding in livestock production, were investigated. In addition to full physico-chemical characterization, the materials were analysed for a suite of priority organic contaminants. In general, contaminants were present at relatively low concentrations. For example, for biosolids and compost-like-output (CLO), concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were approximately 1 − 10 and 5 – 50 times lower, respectively, than various proposed or implemented European limit values for these contaminants in biosolids or composts applied to agricultural land. However, the technical basis for these limits may require re-evaluation in some cases. Polybrominated, and mixed halogenated, dibenzo-p-dioxins/dibenzofurans are not currently considered in risk assessments of dioxins and dioxin-like chemicals, but were detected at relatively high concentrations compared with PCDD/Fs in the biosolids and CLOs and their potential contribution to the overall toxic equivalency is assessed. Other ‘emerging’ contaminants, such as organophosphate flame retardants, were detected {{in several of the}} waste materials, and their potential significance is discussed. The study is part of a wider research programme that will provide evidence that is expected to improve confidence in the use of waste-derived materials in agriculture and to establish guidelines to protect the food chain where necessary...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{key issues}} in {{developing}} Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) {{is represented by the}} optimal utilisation of fertilisers and herbicidal to reduce the impact of Nitrates in soils and the environment. In traditional agriculture practises, these substances were provided to the soils through the use of chemical products (inorganic/organic fertilizers, soil improvers/conditioners, etc.), usually associated to several major environmental problems, such as: water pollution and contamination, fertilizer dependency, soil acidification, trace mineral depletion, over-fertilization, high energy consumption, contribution to climate change, impacts on mycorrhizas, lack of long-term sustainability, etc. For this reason, the agricultural market is more and more interested in the utilisation of organic <b>fertilisers</b> <b>and</b> <b>soil</b> <b>improvers.</b> Among organic fertilizers, there is an emerging interest for the digestate, a sub-product resulting from anaerobic digestion (AD) processes. Several studies confirm the high properties of digestate if used as organic fertilizer and soil improver/conditioner. Digestate, in fact, is somehow similar to compost: AD converts a major part of organic nitrogen to ammonia, which is then directly available to plants as nitrogen. In this paper, new analytical tools, based on HyperSpectral Imaging (HSI) sensing devices, and related detection architectures, is presented and discussed in order to define and apply simple to use, reliable, robust and low cost strategies finalised to define and implement innovative smart detection engines for digestate characterization and monitoring. This approach is finalized to utilize this “waste product” as a valuable organic fertilizer and soil conditioner, in a reduced impact and an “ad hoc” soil fertilisation perspective. Furthermore, the possibility to contemporary utilize the HSI approach to realize a real time physicalchemical characterisation of agricultural soils (i. e. nitrogen, phosphorus, etc., detection) could allow to set up “real time” selective fertilization strategies in order to obtain a safer culture production...|$|E

40|$|In {{the scope}} of the {{presently}} discussed closed substance cycle management and the resulting substance cycling management the agricultural use of animal wastes, sewage sludges and composts as <b>fertilisers</b> <b>and</b> <b>soil</b> <b>improvers,</b> respectively, plays an important role. The aim of the present project was the scientific preparation of deliberations aiming to find out which concentrations of selected contaminants occurring in secondary raw-material fertilisers (sewage sludge and compost) and farm fertilisers can still be tolerated, which do not have harmful effects on the environment. Information on the occurrence in sewage sludges and soils and their effects on soil organisms were compiled and evaluated for the following substances: linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS), nonylphenol (NP), tributyltin (TBT), benzo(a) pyrene (BaP), diethylhexyl phthalate (DEPH) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP). In addition, respective data were searched for polyacrylamide (PAM), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) and polycyclic musk compounds. The impact of composts by organic contaminants was described giving examples for diethylhexyl phthalate and dibutyl phthalate, benzo(a) pyrene and polychlorinated biphenyls. Concerning the farm fertiliser slurry, information about organic pollutants stemming from cleaning agents or disinfectants, NP, LAS and quartenary ammonium compounds were collected. LAS, NP, TBT and DEHP were detected in most of the sewage sludge samples. DBP occurred less frequently and in lower concentrations than DEHP. Single exceedings of the respective limit-values of the 3 "r"d Draft of the EU-Sewage Sludge Directive (LAS, NP, DEHP) or other expert groups (BaP) were observed. In compliance with the respective regulations, {{there seems to be no}} risk potential for terrestrial organisms. To derive reliable environmental standards for TBT, there is a need for more data. In compost, content of organic contaminants is generally dependent on impurities. Compost made of 'green' waste had lowest organic contaminant content. For a final evaluation of the environmental risk of PAM and quaternary ammonium compounds further information is needed. As very few information is available regarding concentrations of PBDE and polycyclic musks in German sewage sludges, no risk assessment could be performed for these substances. (orig.)

40|$|Two {{international}} {{interlaboratory trials}} {{for the analysis}} of growing media <b>and</b> <b>soil</b> <b>improvers</b> were performed. Samples of white sphagnum peat, coir dust, composted green material, uncomposted bark, peat mixture and a peat and clay mixture were tested. Of the materials the pH, electrical conductivity, organic matter content and ash, dry matter content, moisture content, laboratory compacted bulk density, dry bulk density, air volume, water volume, shrinkage value and total pore space were determined using European Standards. The results give an idea about the excitability and reliability of the methods. Results were variable. As a reference a test performed for European standardization was used. Results less good as obtained in the former trial were found for the pH of bark. This appeared to be a difficult material for the pH determination. Also the repeatability and reproducibility results of the organic matter determination of the peat and clay mixture were bad. This can either be caused by the fact that laboratories do not exactly follow the procedure, or the method is more reliable for high organic matter contents and should perhaps be adapted for materials with a low organic matter content. The laboratory compacted bulk density results of the performed test are in most cases satisfactory. The determination of physical parameters were not always good. The repeatability and reproducibility of dry bulk density of composted green material were extremely high. Probably due to the constitution of this compost, dry bulk density is difficult to determine. The method is not suitable for this type of material. Results for bark and peat and clay mixture are also rather poor. For particle density it appeared that some laboratories used another formula as prescribed. Next trial and an amendment will have to be made about how total pore space has to be calculated from particle density. For water and air volume the repeatability and reproducibility results of one of the interlaboratory trials were not good when compared to the former trial. There is not a clear reason but perhaps laboratories need to gain more experience for these determinations. The results show that it is essential to have interlaboratory trials for the physical and chemical characterization of growing media <b>and</b> <b>soil</b> <b>improvers.</b> The procedures still need further improvement.

Our objective was to compare organic fertilizers in their ability to increase the soil organic carbon level, and their influence on P leaching. Three long-term field trials were conducted where fertilization with compost, farmyard manure, digestates, cattle slurry and mineral fertilizers was compared, to determine soil P availability, soil organic carbon level <b>and</b> the <b>soil</b> P content. Soil samples of the tillage layer (0 - 30 cm) were used in a leaching experiment in controlled unsaturated conditions.

After composting the sludge can be reused as <b>fertiliser</b> <b>and</b> <b>soil</b> conditioner in agriculture. Compared to landfilling and incineration, utilisation of sludge-compost is a more sustainable treatment because it recycles both nutrients and organic matter.

The extraction of heavy metals from the sludge before composting is therefore a necessary step to achieve a more sustainable sludge treatment. Extraction of heavy metals by inorganic acids and complexing agents has severe drawbacks.

However, the assimilation of nutrients into APB provides a significant target for their recovery and reuse, and harvesting problematic APB in impacted freshwater bodies offers a complementary approach to aquatic restoration, which could potentially deliver multiple wider ecosystem benefits. This critical review provides an assessment of opportunities and risks linked to nutrient recovery from agriculturally impacted water-bodies through the harvesting of APB for recycling <b>and</b> reuse as <b>fertilisers</b> <b>and</b> <b>soil</b> amendments. By evaluating the economic, social, environmental and health-related dimensions of this resource recovery from ‘waste’ process we propose a research agenda for closing the loop on nutrient transfer from land to water. We identify that environmental benefits are rarely, if ever, prioritised as essential criteria for the exploitation of resources from waste and yet this is key for addressing the current imbalance that sees environmental managers routinely undervaluing the wider environmental benefits that may accrue beyond resource recovery. The approach we advocate for the recycling of ‘waste’ APB nutrients is to couple the remediation of eutrophic waters with the sustainable production of feed <b>and</b> <b>fertiliser,</b> whilst providing multiple downstream benefits and minimising environmental trade-offs.

Field trials {{conducted on the}} highly calcareous soils of Eyre Peninsula (South Australia) showed significant crop growth responses to fluid forms of P fertiliser, as compared to granular forms of P. A glasshouse trial was conducted to compare the responsiveness of wheat to fluid and granular forms of P fertilisers in 29 soils from southern Australia. Two fluid P <b>fertilisers</b> (phosphoric acid <b>and</b> ammonium polyphosphate) were compared to a granular P fertiliser (triple superphosphate) applied at 12 kg P ha- 1. In 86 % of the soils tested wheat growth was P responsive, and in 62 % of these P responsive soils wheat dry matter was significantly greater when fluid P fertilisers were used {{as compared to the}} granular form. These soils were characterised using several chemical analyses with the aim to identify soil characteristics that influence the responsiveness of wheat to fluid fertilisers. Several traditional indicators used to predict P availability such as Colwell P, resin P and total P did not provide an indication of fertiliser type response. Soil calcium carbonate content had a dominant influence on the likelihood of differential responsiveness of a soil to fluid P fertiliser over granular. A bimodal relationship between plant responsiveness to fluid <b>fertilisers</b> <b>and</b> <b>soil</b> pH was observed where in acid <b>and</b> alkaline <b>soils</b> fluid <b>fertilisers</b> outperformed granular products. Therefore, crop response to fluid P fertilisers in various alkaline non-calcareous <b>and</b> acidic <b>soil</b> types requires further testing. Therese M. McBeath, Roger A. Armstrong, E. Lombi, M.

40|$|This {{work was}} {{supported}} by the UK Natural Environment Research Council, as part of the Recycling Biomass to Agricultural LANd: Capitalising on Eutrophication (ReBALAN:CE) project (NE/K 015710 / 1) Eutrophication is a major water pollution issue and can lead to excessive growth of aquatic plant biomass (APB). However, the assimilation of nutrients into APB provides a significant target for their recovery and reuse, and harvesting problematic APB in impacted freshwater bodies offers a complementary approach to aquatic restoration, which could potentially deliver multiple wider ecosystem benefits. This critical review provides an assessment of opportunities and risks linked to nutrient recovery from agriculturally impacted water-bodies through the harvesting of APB for recycling <b>and</b> reuse as <b>fertilisers</b> <b>and</b> <b>soil</b> amendments. By evaluating the economic, social, environmental and health-related dimensions of this resource recovery from 'waste' process we propose a research agenda for closing the loop on nutrient transfer from land to water. We identify that environmental benefits are rarely, if ever, prioritised as essential criteria for the exploitation of resources from waste and yet this is key for addressing the current imbalance that sees environmental managers routinely undervaluing the wider environmental benefits that may accrue beyond resource recovery. The approach we advocate for the recycling of 'waste' APB nutrients is to couple the remediation of eutrophic waters with the sustainable production of feed <b>and</b> <b>fertiliser,</b> whilst providing multiple downstream benefits and minimising environmental trade-offs. This integrated 'ecosystem services approach' has the potential to holistically close the loop on agricultural nutrient loss, and thus sustainably recover finite resources such as phosphorus from waste.

40|$|After proper {{sanitation}} treatment, organic wastes such as animal by-products, e. g. catering waste, {{slaughterhouse waste}} and manure {{can be used}} as <b>fertilisers</b> <b>and</b> <b>soil</b> conditioners <b>and</b> thereby contribute to a sustainable society. However, organic waste may contain pathogenic microorganisms and can thus present a health risk to both humans and animals if not properly treated. In the present thesis regrowth potential of Salmonella Typhimurium, Enterococcus spp. and coliforms in organic waste at psychrophilic and mesophilic temperatures and the time and temperature combinations required for pathogen inactivation during thermal treatments was investigated. This was done with the aim to contribute to hygienically safe recycling of organic waste. Pathogen growth was observed in active compost material as well as in fresh cattle manure. The growth potential decreased with increased maturity of the compost. In thermal treatment of fresh cattle manure, a treatment temperature of 52 °C and a retention time of 17. 2 h or a temperature of 55 °C during 16. 9 h were needed to achieve the reduction targets set by current EU regulation in terms of bacterial reduction. However, this time and temperature combination was not sufficient to achieve the reduction target of 3 log 10 for parvovirus as a thermoresistant virus. The inactivation rate of Salmonella Senftenberg W 775 and Enterococcus spp. were found to increase with increased moisture content whereas the opposite relationship between inactivation rate and moisture content was observed for viruses...|$|R
40|$|Experiments with soybean {{on heavy}} soils of East Slovak Lowlands were {{established}} in the years 2010 – 2012. The effect of mineral <b>fertilisers</b> <b>and</b> <b>soil</b> conditioner application on soybean’s yield using three tillage systems (minimum tillage (MT), conventional tillage (CT) and no tillage (NT)) was studied. Production costs and economic efficiency of crop management practices were evaluated. The influence of production year on soybean crop was significant {{in the order of}} 2011, 2010 and 2012. Statistical evaluation confirmed that the effects of CT and MT systems were more significant compared with NT system. No {{significant differences were found between}} the variants of the mineral <b>fertiliser</b> <b>and</b> conditioner application. Differences in the total cost of soybean cultivation, as measured between years, were not significant. Fertilisation variants with application of HUMAC agro and NPK generated the highest costs. On the other hand, the lowest costs were achieved at fertilisation variants with application of NPK alone. Comparing tillage variants, the CT system had the highest costs each year. Significant savings were achieved on MT and NT variants. During the experimental period, a profit was reached on all variants. Applying NPK alone, the highest profit was achieved in 2010 and 2012 using MT system and in 2011 with CT tillage. The variant b 2 with PRP sol in the years 2010 and 2011 was the most profitable using NT system and in 2012 using MT. Variant with HUMAC agro was the most profitable in each year using MT. The lowest income threshold for zero profitability was calculated in 2012. Using CT farming techniques at NPK fertilisation variant b 1 in 2012, the income threshold was 1. 85 t/ha, at variant b 2 PRP sol it was 2. 10 t/ha and at variant b 3 HUMAC agro it was 2. 42 t/ha. At MT and NT systems, the income threshold values for zero profitability were lower...|$|R
40|$|Production of Pinus radiata {{is a major}} {{contributor}} to New Zealand's economy and new plantings are a valuable carbon sink. Phosphorus (P) deficiency and high P fixing capacity of some volcanic ash soils (e. g. Allophanic Soil) may constrain radiata productivity. This thesis investigates the role of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) root processes in the acquisition of P by P. radiata fiom native <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> <b>soil</b> fertilised with two reactive phosphate rock (RPR) fertilisers. The application of finely-divided RPRs to a P deficient Allophanic Soil significantly increased P. radiata seedling growth and P uptake in 10 month pot trials. RPR dissolution was high in this <b>soil,</b> <b>and</b> it was further enhanced by the radiata rhizosphere processes. The development and formation of ECM in radiata seedlings was stimulated by low rates of RPR application but was hindered in unfertilised <b>soils</b> <b>and</b> high rates of RPR application. The P. radiata ECM roots induced acidification and increased oxalate concentration and phosphatase activities in the rhizosphere soil. These changes in rhizosphere biochemical properties were associated with enhanced solubilisation of <b>fertiliser</b> <b>and</b> <b>soil</b> inorganic P <b>and</b> increased mineralisation of organic P, leading to increased P bioavailability in the rhizosphere. ECM inoculation of P. radiata roots with Rhizopogen rubescens and Suillus luteus stimulated production of phosphatase enzymes and oxalate and induced acidification in the rhizosphere. The extent of root-induced changes in the rhizosphere soils was associated with ECM hyphae length density. A technique using pulse labelling of radiata shoots with 14 CO 2 showed promise in estimating the active ECM hyphae density. The 14 C activity was highly correlated with ECM hyphae density measured by an agar film technique. Overall, observations made in this thesis indicate that sparingly soluble forms of organic and inorganic P in soils low in plant-available P are readily solubilised and utilised for P. radiata growth through ECM rhizosphere processes...|$|R
