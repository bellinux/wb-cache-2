40|$|The {{widespread}} use of antibiotics in association with high-density clinical care has driven the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria that are adapted to thrive in hospitalized patients. Of particular concern are globally disseminated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clones that cause outbreaks and epidemics associated with health care. The most rapidly spreading and tenacious health-care-associated clone in Europe currently is EMRSA- 15, which was first detected in the UK in the early 1990 s and subsequently spread throughout Europe and beyond. Using phylogenomic methods to analyze the genome sequences for 193 S. aureus isolates, {{we were able to}} show that the current pandemic population of EMRSA- 15 descends from a <b>health-care-associated</b> <b>MRSA</b> epidemic that spread throughout England in the 1980 s, which had itself previously emerged from a primarily community-associated methicillin-sensitive population. The emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance in this EMRSA- 15 subclone in the English Midlands during the mid- 1980 s appears to have {{played a key role in}} triggering pandemic spread, and occurred shortly after the first clinical trials of this drug. Genome-based coalescence analysis estimated that the population of this subclone over the last 20 yr has grown four times faster than its progenitor. Using comparative genomic analysis we identified the molecular genetic basis of 99. 8 % of the antimicrobial resistance phenotypes of the isolates, highlighting the potential of pathogen genome sequencing as a diagnostic tool. We document the genetic changes associated with adaptation to the hospital environment and with increasing drug resistance over time, and how MRSA evolution likely has been influenced by country-specific drug use regimens.

40|$|Background. Some {{strains of}} non–multidrug-resistant, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (nmMRSA) in Australia {{are likely to}} have emerged from strains of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) in remote Aboriginal communities. Objective. To {{describe}} the clinical epidemiology of infection due to community-associated MRSA strains in an Australian tropical hospital setting with a significant Aboriginal population and to compare infections caused by community-associated strains of <b>MRSA,</b> <b>health-care–associated</b> strains of <b>MRSA,</b> and MSSA strains with respect to demographic risk factors and clinical outcomes. Methods. We queried the microbiology database for the Top End of the Northern Territory, Australia, to deter-mine population incidences for S. aureus infection and conducted a prospective matched case-control study to compare infection due to nmMRSA, MSSA, or multidrug-resistant MRSA at the Royal Darwin Hospital. Results. The annual incidence of S. aureus bacteremia was 65 cases per 100, 000 population, but in the Aboriginal population the incidence was 172 cases per 100, 000 population (odds ratio [OR] compared with non-Aboriginal popula-tion, 5. 8 [95 % confidence interval {CI}, 3. 8 – 8. 9). Female sex (adjusted OR [aOR], 1. 5 [95 % CI, 1. 1 – 2. 0) and remote residence (aOR, 1. 8 [95 % CI, 1. 2 – 2. 5]) were associated with the isolation of nmMRSA rather than MSSA, but disease spectrum and outcomes were similar. Among those from whom nmMRSA was isolated, Aboriginal patients were younge...|$|R
