5|$|On October 8, 2012, {{the series}} was {{announced}} as ending with issue 300, following which a new title, Constantine started at the main imprint of DC comics. By 2013, Constantine was contacted by the Three Fates, who {{tell him that he}} will finally meet his end in five days. Having lived a good and adventurous life, he happily accepts his fate rather than trying to fight it like <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>does.</b> When the last day came, Constantine was ambushed and shot in his own home right in front of a horrified Epiphany. After he died, Epiphany and Finn had an affair as a way to comfort each other. John's ghost saw them having sex in a graveyard and seemed to give his blessing, making the fates decide that John wasn't going to try to come back to life. Then, of course, he did. He contacted Epiphany and asked her to help resurrect him by making him cigarettes from his ashes, which, after he smoked them, made him corporeal again. Thinking to disappear and live happily ever after with Epiphany, they moved to a tiny house in Ireland, courtesy of Finn, that was totally off the grid and far removed from any apparent trouble, the last place anyone would think to look for John. That didn't last long, though, as John realized he can never run from his past.|$|E
5|$|The vampires include: the Fool (voiced by Ron Funches), the Empress Eyes (voiced by Rebecca Romijn), the Hierophant (voiced by Paul Williams), the Moon (voiced by Beau Billingslea), and the Vampire King himself (voiced by Billy Brown). The vampires are {{surprised}} {{that they are}} alive again, but quickly disagree {{on what to do}} next and go off on their separate ways. Witnessing this, Jake warns Finn and Marceline. Upon realizing the Vampire King is alive again, Marceline flashes back to her previous battle with him. In order to preserve the vampire race, the Vampire King sacrificed himself to bite Marceline, making her the last vampire. Marceline manages to track down and confront the resurrected Vampire King, killing the Fool and reabsorbing his power of flight. However, before she can battle the still weak Vampire King, he warns her that the Empress is headed for the Ice Kingdom. Fearing {{for the safety of the}} Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny), Marceline gives chase. The Empress arrives at the Ice Kingdom and uses her powers to hypnotize the Ice King, ordering him to bring her the blood of Finn. Marceline attempts to attack the Empress right as the Ice King returns with a captured Finn. Finn escapes, and the Empress orders Ice King to capture them. In an attempt to jog the Ice King's memory, Marceline tells him that she was motivated to start hunting vampires when she killed one trying to attack a human family. However, it's revealed that the Ice King was never hypnotized by the Empress, but merely acting as <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>does</b> around women. Marceline then attacks the Empress, but the Empress quickly gains the upper hand until she is paralyzed by a special gun Bubblegum developed. Marceline kills the Empress and reabsorbs her power of invisibility. She then apologizes to her friends for trying to fight the vampires alone and tells them they will hunt the remaining vampires together.|$|E
500|$|In Gilligan Unbound, author Paul Arthur Cantor {{states that}} he {{believes}} Homer's devotion to his family has added to {{the popularity of the}} character. He writes, [...] "Homer is the distillation of pure fatherhood. [...] This is why, for all his stupidity, bigotry and self-centered quality, we cannot hate Homer. He continually fails at being a good father, but he never gives up trying, and in some basic and important sense that makes him a good father." [...] The Sunday Times remarked [...] "Homer is good because, above all, he is capable of great love. When the chips are down, <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>does</b> the right thing by his children—he is never unfaithful in spite of several opportunities." ...|$|E
60|$|Ned Hampton {{went back}} to breakfast at the cart, as <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> when Jacob was there.|$|R
60|$|Last of {{all came}} the reindeer, looking as <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> {{as if some}} serious {{business}} was on hand.|$|R

500|$|Dale's {{characters}} {{on most of}} the American television shows he has appeared on have shared similar character traits, which Dale describes as the [...] "go-to powerful guy" [...] role. Following his appearance as Senator Eaton in The Killing in 2011, reviewers commented on his tendency to play powerful, wealthy and mysterious characters in many shows. Maureen Ryan of TV Squad wrote that it was [...] "lovely to see Alan Dale playing a typically Alan Dale-ian character. He's always so great at playing That Sketchy Wealthy Guy With a Hidden Agenda, which he has now played on, I believe, 87 different shows. And <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>does</b> it well." [...] Coincidentally, Dale's characters in Neighbours, The O.C. and Ugly Betty have all been killed off by a fatal heart attack. Christopher Rosen of The New York Observer wrote in 2008 that [...] "with his square jaw and seemingly no nonsense attitude, Mr. Dale is the go-to actor when casting directors need a conservative-looking authoritarian. When he comes onto the screen, audiences immediately take him seriously, since he radiates rich, smug and serious. He demands your respect." [...] Rosen says that Dale is [...] "not even...a particularly good actor" [...] but is [...] "fine enough" [...] and [...] "bring a no frills, no gimmicks style to his roles," [...] and [...] "manages to give a consistent performance in every show he appears on." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "In the Dark" [...] was {{directed}} by Ethan Lader. Dev enlisted Lader to make the video as he regularly makes videos for her and The Cataracs. Lader originally contacted her with ideas for the clip, and she soon replied with what she would want in the video. She said, [...] "So we did that back and forth, which <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>does</b> with me until I get my point across. ... and then we met up and we got both of our ideas and feelings across. I wanted to be sexy and dark like the song is, in a really interesting way, and we pulled it off, I think." [...] The video was filmed in Los Angeles, California in late-April 2011, just before Dev joined Usher as the opening act for his OMG Tour. Dev took {{more control over the}} [...] "In the Dark" [...] video than previous video shoots as she used to let the director [...] "take a little bit of control" [...] when she was inexperienced in the process. In an interview with Idolator, Dev elaborated on the video's concept, stating that she wanted a dark feel similar to Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland: [...] "I wanted the video to be sexy as well. I wanted it to reflect all the dark aspects of the song, and initially we went in thinking that we'd have an Alice in Wonderland/Tim Burton type of feel." ...|$|E
2500|$|Croll {{chose to}} skip the Preakness Stakes on May 21 and instead entered Holy Bull in the prestigious Metropolitan Handicap, popularly known as the Met Mile, against older horses on May 30. The field {{included}} the 1993 Belmont Stakes winner Colonial Affair, multiple stakes winner Devil His Due and the fast improving Cherokee Run, who {{would go on to}} be named the champion sprinter of 1994. In one of his best performances, Holy Bull quickly took the lead and drew off to win by [...] lengths, earning a Beyer Speed Figure of 122. [...] "I still can't explain the Derby," [...] said Smith. [...] "But today he came out and showed what he is, like <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>does</b> [...] – except for the first Saturday in May. He broke well and, every time I asked him to pick it up, he picked it up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How is Milly this morning?" [...] asked MacRummle, {{who came}} down late to breakfast, as <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> and {{consequently}} missed morning prayers.|$|R
60|$|I {{went on with}} my breakfast, and Mr. Pumblechook {{continued}} to stand over me, staring fishily and breathing noisily, as <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>did.</b>|$|R
60|$|Alwyn {{lifted his}} soft brown eyes reverently and said, 'It is {{something}} good,' speaking, as <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> in a baby lisp inimitable here.|$|R
2500|$|Gavin's final storyline {{sees him}} {{kidnapping}} Kathy, killing his sister Margaret Midhurst (Jan Harvey) and being arrested. Nicholas {{said of the}} storyline, [...] "Gavin {{will be up to}} the usual sullied, nasty things", while Taylforth explained, [...] "He is coming back to cause the usual mayhem that <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>does.</b> Paul is great playing a villain, we all love him to bits! He still controls Kathy in a certain way. She thought last time that she could control him – as soon as starts talking to her, he wins her over again—as he always does!" [...] The storyline includes a cliffhanger where it is not known if it is Margaret or Kathy who has been killed. Kilkelly said the end of the episode was a [...] "sinister surprise" [...] and that [...] "Gavin Sullivan appeared to reach villainous new heights". Duncan Lindsay from the Metro said of Gavin, [...] "He's clearly lost it and with a body on his hands and the control slipping from his grasp, there's no telling what Gavin might do next", adding that [...] "The final chapter of the saga is about to unfold in dramatic fashion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{behaved like}} a brute;--as <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>does.</b> Thrashing a brute hardly answers nowadays, but if ever a man {{deserved}} a thrashing he does." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. He is our clergyman, and <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>does</b> as we tell him; and so Dunstone {{is quite}} the model parish of the archdeaconry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My ol' {{dad was a}} Baptist," [...] Hootchinoo Bill supplemented. [...] "An' <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> hold it was forty {{thousand}} miles nearer that way." ...|$|R
5000|$|Rod Phillips {{signed off}} his final game the way <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> albeit {{slightly}} differently: [...] "Good night, and goodbye, from Rexall Place in Edmonton!" ...|$|R
60|$|And after that, he {{had made}} up his mind to always start on a Friday; and <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> and <b>always</b> had a good time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Papa {{talks of}} going to Scarrowby for a few weeks. <b>He</b> <b>always</b> <b>does</b> every year, and it is so dull. Did you ever see Scarrowby?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{sit down}} and {{tell me more about}} the election," [...] she said. [...] "Sydney is sure to go to sleep. <b>He</b> <b>always</b> <b>does</b> after shooting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Assuredly. He {{meant to}} fetch nurse {{if he had}} any doubt, but {{afterwards}} he was going to his court about his rents. <b>He</b> <b>always</b> <b>does</b> that on Saturday evenings.' ...|$|E
60|$|Captain Truck {{shook the}} baronet heartily by the hand, as <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> when this offer was renewed, declaring that his {{feelings}} did him honour.|$|R

6000|$|Again the baronet {{shook his}} head. [...] "Lord Southcliff had it {{made in the}} office," [...] he said. [...] "It appears that <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>does.</b> Otherwise the {{physical}} features might not suit him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here is the canary, gentlemen," [...] {{said the}} landlady; [...] "and the goodman has {{set off the}} mill, to come to wait on you himself. <b>He</b> <b>always</b> <b>does</b> so, when company drink wine." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was glad}} when the {{coastguard}} came along, with his spyglass under his arm. He stopped {{to talk with}} me, as <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>does,</b> but all the time kept looking at a strange ship.|$|E
6000|$|With a sad {{little smile}} Miss Lydia watched him button his [...] "Father Hubbard" [...] and depart, pausing at the door, as <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> to bow profoundly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't {{know that}} unlucky {{is the proper}} word, but <b>he</b> has <b>always</b> stood between me and success; at least, <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> for it is some years since our paths have crossed." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, of course; <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>does</b> those things," [...] said Eustace, {{speaking}} with {{a tone of}} proprietorship, as if Harold had been a splendid self-acting steam-engine. [...] "I am very glad to have gratified you, Miss Tracy--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell father {{all about}} it, and he'll {{know just what}} to do. <b>He</b> <b>always</b> <b>does,</b> and every one goes to him. May he come and see you, ma'am?" [...] said Abby, longing to take them all home at once.|$|E
25|$|We {{are losing}} {{one of its}} finest Members, a Member that I have great respect for, because <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> his homework, was so {{articulate}} and eloquent on this floor.|$|R
