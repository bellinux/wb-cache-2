50|$|When {{producers}} either face {{a financial}} or physical burden of recycling their electronics after use, {{they may be}} incentivized to design more sustainable, less toxic, and easily recyclable electronics. Using fewer materials and designing products to last longer can directly reduce producers' end-of-life costs.

5000|$|Every {{engineering}} {{discipline is}} engaged in sustainable design, employing numerous initiatives, especially life cycle analysis (LCA), pollution prevention, design for the environment (DfE), design for disassembly (DfD), and <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>recycling</b> (DfR). These are replacing or at least changing pollution control paradigms. For example, concept of a [...] "cap and trade" [...] has been tested and works well for some pollutants. This is a system where companies are allowed to place a [...] "bubble" [...] over a whole manufacturing complex or trade pollution credits with other companies in their industry instead of a [...] "stack-by-stack" [...] and [...] "pipe-by-pipe" [...] approach, i.e. the so-called [...] "command and control" [...] approach. Such policy and regulatory innovations call for some improved technology based approaches as well as better quality-based approaches, such as leveling out the pollutant loadings and using less expensive technologies to remove the first large bulk of pollutants, followed by higher operation and maintenance (O&M) technologies for the more difficult to treat stacks and pipes. But, the net effect can be a greater reduction of pollutant emissions and effluents than treating each stack or pipe as an independent entity. This is a foundation for most sustainable design approaches, i.e. conducting a life-cycle analysis, prioritizing the most important problems, and matching the technologies and operations to address them. The problems will vary by size (e.g. pollutant loading), difficulty in treating, and feasibility. The most intractable problems are often those that are small but very expensive and difficult to treat, i.e. less feasible. Of course, as with all paradigm shifts, expectations must be managed from both a technical and an operational perspective. [...] Historically, sustainability considerations have been approached by engineers as constraints on their designs. For example, hazardous substances generated by a manufacturing process were dealt with as a waste stream that must be contained and treated. The hazardous waste production had to be constrained by selecting certain manufacturing types, increasing waste handling facilities, and if these did not entirely do the job, limiting rates of production. Green engineering recognizes that these processes are often inefficient economically and environmentally, calling for a comprehensive, systematic life cycle approach.

40|$|The {{underpinning}} idea {{of extended}} producer responsibility rules has been to provide incentives for manufacturers to design products {{that are easy to}} recycle. However, current incentives for <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>recycling</b> are limited, due to the problems in assigning costs for collection and recycling of individual products to the relevant producers. An alternative way to promote <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>recycling,</b> or to increase recycling, is to use mandatory standards for ecodesign, or stipulate that recycled materials must be used in new products. The European Union’s Ecodesign Directive has mainly been used to regulate the energy efficiency of products, but there is now interest in using the Directive to trigger resource efficiency and <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>recycling.</b> In this contribution we look at potential ecodesign standards, and discuss how requirements on recycled content could be applied to trigger high quality recycling of plastic waste from electrical and electronic equipment.

40|$|Recycling is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most effective measures for tackling imminent environmental problems. Over the past few decades, environmentalists, researchers, designers, and policymakers have made great efforts to reduce and recycle waste. However, compared to other developed cities, Hong Kong’s household waste recycling rate is still low with only 40 %. In recent years, increasing numbers of designers and researchers have recognised that public design provided as a tool or service in public spaces is a significant factor for sustainable behaviour. Low quality and inefficient public <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>recycling</b> may fail to mobilise community participation. This paper aims to provide an in- depth investigation into households’ attitudes toward recycling and to shed light on the public <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>recycling.</b> This paper employs both quantitative and qualitative research methods. Based on an empirical study in a densely populated district, Kwun Tong, the findings indicate that public design is a key factor for facilitating or constraining sustainable behaviour. This paper further identifies some characteristics of public design and discusses how design can be improved to meet people’s needs and preferences. Finally, the paper provides recommendations for researchers and policymakers to encourage household participation in recycling by improving the quality of public design.

40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{end-of-life}} phase has come into focus. European Union directives have been issued regulating certain product groups and producer responsibility.

The overall aim of the presented activities has been to increase the effectiveness of current recycling practices, both in terms of design changes and end-of-life treatment process suggestions. A “pre-step” operation has been suggested, in order to either salvage valuable (or toxic) material or to remove diluting bulk material. As this thesis is focused on the recycling of white-goods specifically dishwashers the suggested prestep would be removal of valuable copper prior to shredding. A life cycle assessment (LCA) study has been conducted. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if using a pre-step is beneficial from an environmental point of view or not.

40|$|Cytochrome P 450 monooxygenases are {{biocatalysts}} that hydroxylate or epoxidise a {{wide range}} of hydrophobic organic substrates. To date their technical application is limited to a small number of whole-cell biooxidations. The use of the isolated enzymes is believed to be impractical due to the low stability of this enzyme class, to the stochiometric need of the expensive cofactor NADPH, and due to the low solubility of most substrates in aqueous media. To overcome these problems we have investigated the application of a bacterial monooxygenase (mutants of CYP 102 A 1) in a biphasic reaction system supported by cofactor recycling with NADP+-dependent formate dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas sp 101. Using this experimental setup, cyclohexane, octane and myristic acid were hydroxylated.

This paper deals only with used textiles like clothing, home- and household textiles which households {{want to get rid}} of because they have no further use for these articles. The habits of households in waste-disposal and the average time of use of different textile products have been investigated by a representative sample of about 900 households in four cities of different structures. The data have been analysed by uni- and bivariate statistical methods. The disposal behaviour of private households concerning used textiles is greatly determined by the attitude they have developed over time towards the alternatives of disposal ways. Depending to quality, quantities and type of textile there are barriers for using collecting systems which are <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> <b>recycling.</b> While outerwear usually is disposed for further use or recycling, underwear and household textiles are disposed with other garbage for landfill or burning systems.
