60|$|Father Benwell {{once more}} remonstrated <b>in</b> <b>dumb</b> <b>show,</b> and Romayne lost his temper.|$|R
60|$|And so saying, {{the knight}} filled himself a horn of canary, and pledged his ward <b>in</b> <b>dumb</b> <b>show.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Bless my soul! {{this is most}} extraordinary. I {{have seen}} nothing of this," [...] he said, {{appealing}} <b>in</b> <b>dumb</b> <b>show</b> to his companion.|$|R
6000|$|Enter ALMANZOR and ALMAHIDE, OZMYN and BENZAYDA; ALMAHIDE [...] {{brought in}} a chair; ALMANZOR led betwixt Soldiers. ISABELLA [...] salutes ALMAHIDE <b>in</b> <b>dumb</b> <b>show.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{stranger}} {{looked at}} Huish {{with an air}} of faint surprise, and looked pointedly away again. It was hard to be more offensive <b>in</b> <b>dumb</b> <b>show.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Vimpany's {{expressive}} {{eyes looked}} up, with saintly resignation, at the dirty ceiling--and asked <b>in</b> <b>dumb</b> <b>show</b> {{what she had}} done to deserve the injury implied by a doubt.|$|R
6000|$|... [Affixed to 296] During {{this speech}} Alhadra returns, and unobserved by Alvar and Teresa scans the picture, and <b>in</b> <b>dumb</b> <b>show</b> compares {{it with the}} countenance of Alvar. Then conceals it in her robe. MS. III.|$|R
6000|$|DUMONT. Embrace {{neither of}} them; embrace nobody; {{there has been}} too much of this sickening folly. To bed!!! (Exit violently R.U.E. All the {{characters}} troop slowly upstairs, talking <b>in</b> <b>dumb</b> <b>show.</b> BERTRAND and MACAIRE remain in front C., watching them go.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... [Prefixed to 279.] Alhadra {{walks away}} {{to the back of}} the stage, to the part where Alvar had first placed himself, stoops in the act of taking up a small Picture, looks at it and <b>in</b> <b>dumb</b> <b>show</b> appears as talking to herself. Corr. in MS. III.|$|R
60|$|Joe did as his {{companion}} wished; {{but the old}} lady positively refused {{to take the money}} until the boy urged her <b>in</b> <b>dumb</b> <b>show,</b> when, with the air of one who complies with a request against her will, she took from Master Potter's outstretched hand a dime.|$|R
6000|$|Her ladyship rose in her grandest proportions, {{and made}} a {{courtesy}} which was {{nothing less than a}} triumph of polite satire <b>in</b> <b>dumb</b> <b>show.</b> Sir Patrick answered by a profound bow and a smile which said, eloquently, [...] "I believe every word of that charming answer. Admirable woman--adieu!" ...|$|R
60|$|The Dodger {{nodded in}} the affirmative, and, shading {{the flame of}} the candle with his hand, gave Charley Bates a private intimation, <b>in</b> <b>dumb</b> <b>show,</b> that he had better not be funny just then. Having {{performed}} this friendly office, he fixed {{his eyes on the}} Jew's face, and awaited his directions.|$|R
60|$|People {{began to}} leave the Hall--in ones and twos first, then in a steady stream which blocked the doorways. It was plain to the dullest {{intelligence}} {{that if there was}} going to be any more concert, it would have to be performed <b>in</b> <b>dumb</b> <b>show.</b> Mr Kay flung down his baton.|$|R
6000|$|... (He tries {{various places}} and postures, {{and comes to}} rest leaning over a high chair, whence, <b>in</b> <b>dumb</b> <b>show,</b> he {{addresses}} a gathering. CRICHTON, with the best intentions, gives him a footstool to stand on, and departs, happily unconscious that ERNEST in some dudgeon has kicked the footstool across the room.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it won't {{be nearly}} such regular {{acting as the}} last," [...] said Beatrice, [...] "I {{do not think it}} would do to take another half-play for so many spectators, but a scene or two mostly <b>in</b> <b>dumb</b> <b>show</b> would make a very nice diversion. Only say that you consent, grandpapa." ...|$|R
60|$|The elders {{would have}} sat and talked all the evening, {{but the young}} folks were bent on having their usual Christmas frolic; so, {{after an hour of}} {{pleasant}} chat, they began to get restless, and having consulted together <b>in</b> <b>dumb</b> <b>show,</b> they devised a way to very effectually break up the family council.|$|R
60|$|Every one who {{has tried}} it knows what a silly, almost imbecile, feeling comes over one when one {{attempts}} the communication of ideas <b>in</b> <b>dumb</b> <b>show.</b> Feelings of this sort affected our hero very keenly. He therefore, while continuing the pantomime, kept up a running or interjectional accompaniment in the English language.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The lady! the lady! an' she's all in red!' The {{men were}} {{so intent on}} {{something}} {{that they did not}} seem to hear. They were peering out to the north, and were arguing <b>in</b> <b>dumb</b> <b>show</b> as though on something regarding which they did not agree. She drew closer, and touching the old fisherman on the shoulder, called out at his ear: ...|$|R
60|$|Whereupon Mr. Mistrust with {{no little}} {{confidence}} commended me <b>in</b> <b>dumb</b> <b>show</b> to the landlady of the Inn, a Mrs. Nature, if I understood him aright. This person was still comely, though of uncertain age, wore cherry ribbons, smiled rather vacantly from vague, wonderful, indescribable eyes {{that seemed to}} change colour, like the chameleon, according to that they dwelt on.|$|R
6000|$|... "That'll {{be all the}} {{dialogue}} for the present," [...] he said. [...] "We'll play {{the rest of our}} act <b>in</b> <b>dumb</b> <b>show.</b> Get a move on you, and I'll take you out in the bubble--the automobile, the car, the chug-chug wagon, the thing we came here in, {{if you want to know}} what bubble is--and we'll scare up some breakfast." ...|$|R
6000|$|What {{had become}} of the other one? Granville asked in the same fashion, by looking around him on all sides <b>in</b> <b>dumb</b> <b>show,</b> inquiringly. One finger only was held up now, {{pointing}} about the hut; one hand was laid upon his own breast {{to show that a}} single white man alone remained. He glanced about him uneasily. What had happened to his companion? ...|$|R

60|$|The Contessa {{was ready}} first, Alexander {{went to the}} piano, a space was cleared. Orpah, in {{beautiful}} oriental clothes, began slowly to dance {{the death of her}} husband. Then Ruth came, and they wept together, and lamented, then Naomi came to comfort them. It was all done <b>in</b> <b>dumb</b> <b>show,</b> the women danced their emotion in gesture and motion. The little drama went on for a quarter of an hour.|$|R
60|$|The {{bereaved}} widow bent down, and, {{raising the}} lid, {{shook her head}} tearfully as she regarded the contents. Then she gathered up the clothes under her left arm, and, still sobbing, took his watch, his knife, and some small change from his chest while the crew <b>in</b> <b>dumb</b> <b>show</b> inquired of the deceased, who was regarding her {{over the edge of}} the bunk, what was to be done.|$|R
6000|$|... "P'r'aps. Stalky {{was sent}} {{up for his}} wiggin' like a bad little boy. I've {{reason to believe that}} His Excellency's hair stood on end. He walked into Stalky for one hour--Stalky at {{attention}} {{in the middle of the}} floor, and (so he vowed) Von Lennaert pretending to soothe down His Excellency's topknot <b>in</b> <b>dumb</b> <b>show</b> <b>in</b> the background. Stalky didn't dare to look up, or he'd have laughed." ...|$|R

5000|$|By this time, the Chatham Theatre was {{performing}} poorly. It became a circus {{for a time}} before eventually reopening as a playhouse. Admissions were low for the time: 25Â¢ for the boxes, one shilling for the pit, and six pence for the gallery. The audience now consisted of the lower classes, who on holidays [...] "used to talk, shout, and scream so that the actors went through their parts <b>in</b> <b>dumb</b> <b>show</b> [...] [...] [...] [...]" ...|$|R
60|$|Oh yes, indeed! HE tell. HE! What? He was the head, was he? From the strong-minded woman {{downwards}} everybody fell, that instant, upon Mr Spottletoe, {{who after}} vainly attempting {{to be heard}} in silence was fain to sit down again, folding his arms and shaking his head most wrathfully, and giving Mrs Spottletoe to understand <b>in</b> <b>dumb</b> <b>show,</b> that that scoundrel Pecksniff might go on for the present, but he would cut in presently, and annihilate him.|$|R
60|$|The dwarf nodded. Mr Swiveller {{drew back}} and nodded likewise, then drew {{a little further}} back and nodded again, and so on. By these means he in time reached the door, where he gave a great cough to attract the dwarf's {{attention}} and gain an opportunity of expressing <b>in</b> <b>dumb</b> <b>show,</b> the closest confidence and most inviolable secrecy. Having performed the serious pantomime that was necessary for the due conveyance of these idea, he cast himself upon his friend's track, and vanished.|$|R
60|$|Poor Lindsay! {{his heart}} was heavy, while {{he did his best}} to convey <b>in</b> <b>dumb</b> <b>show</b> his {{congratulations}} to Kambira, for he saw in this unexpected re-union an insurmountable difficulty in the way of taking Azinte back to her former mistress--not that he had ever seen the remotest chance of his being able to achieve that desirable end before this difficulty arose, but love is at times insanely hopeful, just as at other times-- and with equally little reason--it is madly despairing.|$|R
60|$|Just {{then the}} colonel entered, and Rosebud at once {{received}} {{him with a}} tornado of maddening yelps, so that {{for at least five}} minutes it had the entire monopoly of the conversation, and Miss Peppy was obliged to say good-morning <b>in</b> <b>dumb</b> <b>show.</b> At the same time, the colonel frowned fiercely at Rosebud, and said something which Miss Peppy could not hear because of the noise, but which, from the abrupt motion of the lips, she suspected must be something very wicked indeed.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{know you}} didn't speak, still {{you said to}} him very plainly and enthusiastically <b>in</b> <b>dumb</b> <b>show,</b> [...] "Hello! you in town? Awful glad to see you, old fellow; {{when did you get}} back?" [...] Concealed in your actions was what you have called [...] "a {{misleading}} reservation of an explanatory fact"--the act that you had never seen him before. You expressed joy in encountering him--a lie; and you made that reservation--another lie. It was my pair over again. But don't be troubled--we all do it.' ...|$|R
60|$|At her {{appearance}} her husband, without really stirring at all, {{had the effect}} of withdrawing into the background, where, indeed, I tacitly joined him; and the two ladies remained in charge of the drama, while he and I conversed, as it were, <b>in</b> <b>dumb</b> <b>show.</b> Apart from my sympathy with her in the matter, I was very curious to see how my wife would play her part, which seemed to me far the more difficult of the two, since she must make all the positive movements.|$|R
50|$|The {{tradition}} of the ancients vividly affected our own early dramatists. Not only were the mystery plays and miracles of the Middle Ages begun by a homily, but when the drama in its modern sense was inaugurated in the reign of Elizabeth, the prologue came with it, directly adapted from the practice of Euripides and Terence. Sackville, Lord Buckhurst, prepared a sort of prologue <b>in</b> <b>dumb</b> <b>show</b> for his Gorboduc of 1562; and he also wrote a famous Induction, which is, practically, a prologue, to a miscellany of short romantic epics by diverse hands.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{did it on}} purpose!" [...] {{he almost}} shouted, quite forgetting where he was; [...] "just let me get at him, I'll have his wig off!" [...] and then, without waiting for any more, the entire {{audience}} burst out into a roar of laughter, which, however, unseemly, was perfectly reasonable; during which Mr. Fiddlestick could be seen apologising <b>in</b> <b>dumb</b> <b>show,</b> with a bland smile upon his countenance, while Mr. News and Mr. Roscoe between them dragged the outraged Addison to his seat, and proffered him handkerchiefs to wipe his bleeding nose.|$|R
