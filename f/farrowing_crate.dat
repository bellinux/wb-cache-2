40|$|A {{cohort study}} {{was carried out}} on 112 {{breeding}} pig farms in England to investigate the impact of type of farrowing accommodation on preweaning mortality in piglets. Four types of farrowing accommodation were studied; <b>farrowing</b> <b>crates,</b> indoor loose pens, crate/loose systems (where the sow was restrained in a crate during birth and {{the first days of}} lactation before being moved to a loose pen) and outdoor farrowing in arcs in paddocks. Four estimates of preweaning mortality were collected: an oral estimate from the farmer before the visit, an estimate from the 6 -month rolling average from computer records, records from 20 litters observed when the farm was visited and prospective records collected from 20 farrowings after the visit. These four estimates were significantly correlated. The prospective records also included a farmer reported date and cause of death. From the prospective data there were 25, 031 piglets from 2143 litters from 112 farms, 6. 5 % of piglets were stillborn while live born preweaning mortality was 12 %. Mixed effect discrete time survival, binomial and competing risk, models were used to investigate the association between preweaning mortality and farrowing accommodation, controlling for sow parity, litter size and number of piglets stillborn and fostered. There was a reduced risk of stillbirths in outdoor farrowing systems compared with crated systems. Farmers reported that crushing of healthy piglets was the most frequent cause of death accounting for 55 % of live born preweaning mortality. There {{was no significant difference in}} mortality in live born piglets by farrowing system. There was a significantly higher risk of farmer reported crushing of healthy live born piglets in outdoor arcs compared with piglets reared with sows in <b>farrowing</b> <b>crates</b> and a significantly reduced risk of death from causes other than crushing in piglets reared outdoors or in crate/loose systems compared with piglets reared in crated systems. We conclude that, in the farms in this study, <b>farrowing</b> <b>crates</b> reduced the risk of preweaning live born mortality attributable to crushing but piglets in this system were at increased risk of death from other causes. Consequently crates had no significant effect on overall preweaning mortality percentage.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of sow confinement and nonconfinement during parturition and early lactation on the performance of sows and piglets prior to weaning. Sows and their litters were housed in either a conventional <b>farrowing</b> <b>crate</b> (control; 1. 7 × 2. 4 m) or a swing-sided pen (2. 8 × 2. 15 m). Sows housed in the swing-sided pen had the crate open (open) or closed (closed) during farrowing and opened on d 3 (LAC 3) or 7 (LAC 7) of lactation. Data are means ± SEM. The numbers of total and liveborn piglets were not different between treatments and averaged 13. 1 ± 0. 4 and 12. 3 ± 0. 2 piglets/litter, respectively. Sows housed in a <b>farrowing</b> <b>crate</b> had a greater (P = 0. 03) number of stillborn piglets compared with open sows from pens (1. 1 ± 0. 2 vs. 0. 6 ± 0. 1 piglets/ litter, respectively). Live-born piglet mortality before litter equalization on d 1 was greater (P 0. 05). Total live-born piglet mortality from birth until weaning for the control, closedLAC 7, closedLAC 3, openLAC 7, and openLAC 3 was 1. 86 ± 0. 19, 1. 95 ± 0. 23, 2. 10 ± 0. 39, 2. 45 ± 0. 27, and 3. 74 ± 0. 48, piglets/litter, respectively.

40|$|The European Directive 2001 / 93 /EC {{states that}} every pig must have {{permanent}} {{access to a}} sufficient quantity of material to enable proper investigation and manipulation activities. This implies that also piglets in the <b>farrowing</b> <b>crate</b> {{should have access to}} suitable materials. Providing these materials can be considered as a form of environmental enrichment. Enrichment in the <b>farrowing</b> <b>crate</b> can be important to reduce aggression and frustration behaviour in piglets and to encourage play behaviour. The ethological question rises from what age enrichment must be introduced to be used by the piglets. It is possible that during the first days, the piglets explore the environment only to a limited extent and they will stay close to the sow. Later, the piglets focus their attention on the environment and pen mates too. To avoid harmful and frustration behaviour, enrichment could be important in this stage. In an attempt to determine the age on which enrichment can be introduced, 227 suckling piglets (116 males and 111 females from 22 sows) were observed in the <b>farrowing</b> <b>crate</b> until weaning. Behavioural observations were carried out using the scan sampling method. Data were analysed using the logistic mixed model. The results showed that social play behaviour increased with the age and the same result was seen with exploring the crate. Piglets already showed explorative behavior {{during the first week of}} life. Nosing and nibbling other piglets was also already seen during the first week of life. The frequency of nosing and nibbling the sow did not change with the age, except from a fluctuation in week 3. The results suggest that environmental enrichment can be introduced when piglets are one week old to offer the piglets opportunities to perform explorative and play behavior, without developing harmful behaviours. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Manual {{observation}} and classification of animal behaviors is laborious, time-consuming, and of limited ability to process {{large amount of}} data. A computer vision-based system was developed that automatically recognizes sow behaviors (lying, sitting, standing, kneeling, feeding, drinking, and shifting) in <b>farrowing</b> <b>crate.</b> The system consisted of a low-cost 3 D camera that simultaneously acquires digital and depth images and a software program that detects and identifies the sow’s behaviors. This paper describes the computational algorithm {{for the analysis of}} depth images and presents its performance in recognizing the sow’s behaviors as compared to manual recognition. The images were acquired at 6 s intervals on three days of a 21 -day lactation period. Based on analysis of the 6 s interval images, the algorithm had the following accuracy of behavioral classification: 99. 9 % in lying, 96. 4 % in sitting, 99. 2 % in standing, 78. 1 % in kneeling, 97. 4 % in feeding, 92. 7 % in drinking, and 63. 9 % in transitioning between behaviors. The lower classification accuracy for the transitioning category presumably stemmed from insufficient frequency of the image acquisition which can be readily improved. Hence the reported system provides an effective way to automatically process and classify the sow’s behavioral images.
