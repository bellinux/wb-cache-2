40|$|This study assesses {{targeting}} {{efficiency and}} effectiveness {{of the two most}} important welfare programs in Egypt, the food subsidy program and the Social Assistance Program. The study uses two sources for data: field data for seven governorates in Egypt with the highest poverty ratio, and published data. It finds that the food subsidy program is fairly inefficient in targeting the lower income groups, especially in rural areas. Also, it is not well targeted on the governorates’ level. Upper Egypt governorates with the highest poverty ratios take less food subsidy, as compared to urban governorates with the lowest poverty levels. The study finds, also, that the Social Assistance Program is insufficient to cover the minimum cost of living for the lowest income groups in Egypt, and it is not well targeted on the governorates’ level, given their relative poverty levels. Finally, assessing the impact of <b>in-kind</b> <b>subsidy</b> vis- à-vis cash subsidy on poverty in Egypt, it has been found that <b>in-kind</b> <b>subsidy</b> is preferable to cash subsidy, since with the high inflation rate in the country, the former provides the poor with a set amount of necessary food commodities, while the purchasing power of cash transfers will deteriorate with the rise in prices. However, the distribution system of the <b>in-kind</b> <b>subsidy</b> has to be structurally revised to welltarget the poor and the low-income people in Egypt...|$|E
40|$|In-kind price {{subsidies}} {{are a new}} and important feature of U. S. agricultural policy. Yet the market effects of such subsidies have not been widely discussed in the professional literature even through they differ importantly from similar cash subsidies. This paper examines in-kind subsidies with simple, static demand and supply functions. In-kind price subsidies push down prices to favored buyers and increase total sales relative to no subsidy or to an equivalent cash subsidy. Inventory holdings by the subsidizing authority are diminished. However, the effects of an <b>in-kind</b> <b>subsidy</b> upon prices received by sellers and commercial sales volume (net of stock disposals) are problematic, depending upon the price elasticity of demand in the subsidized market. If the demand, including retaliation by other sellers, is price elastic, then an <b>in-kind</b> <b>subsidy</b> will increase prices received by sellers and commercial sales volume. But if the demand is inelastic, then sellers' prices and commercial sales volume will drop relative to a no-subsidy situation or to an equivalent cash subsidy. These conclusions do not depend upon the methods by which the scheme is administered. Agricultural and Food Policy, International Relations/Trade,...|$|E
30|$|It is {{important}} to note that the intervention studied by Devoto et al. (2012) provided a loan rather than an <b>in-kind</b> <b>subsidy.</b> Their conclusions are useful in terms of the barriers that households face to improve housing. In this case it was credit constraints, because households were willing to pay for the water connection once offered the loan. Thus, initiatives like that in Morocco, for which there is willingness to pay, can involve relatively low costs for the state yet improve the welfare of poor urban families through investments in better housing.|$|E

40|$|Does {{the format}} of a {{financial}} aid program influence how it affects college decisions? This paper examines this question by focusing on state appropriations to public postsecondary institutions. While these funds subsidize tuition costs for in-state students, the in-kind format of the aid an resulting price gap {{between public and private}} colleges could also affect choices between colleges. The paper analyzes this possible effect utilizing a conditional logistic choice model, which exploits extensive match-specific information between individuals and nearly 2, 700 colleges. Using estimates of how price, quality, and distance influence college decisions, I examine the impact of several dissimilar state subsidy regimes and simulate how decisions would change if the aid were awarded in other ways. The results suggest that the level and distribution pattern of state subsidies strongly influence decisions. When <b>in-kind</b> <b>subsidies</b> are large, students appear to choose public colleges even if the gap in resources between public and private options is substantial. If the aid were instead distributed as a credit applicable to any in-state college, up to 29 percent more students would prefer to attend private four-year colleges. The results also suggest that the <b>in-kind</b> <b>subsidies</b> create incentives for students to favor public four-year colleges over two-year institutions. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{analyzes the}} interaction between a bulk commodity and a processed good under <b>in-kind</b> export <b>subsidies.</b> An <b>in-kind</b> export <b>subsidy</b> lowers the export price of the good on which it is paid. The other price changes are ambiguous. A numerical model for U. S. wheat and flour illustrates these conditions.

40|$|An <b>in-kind</b> <b>subsidy</b> is equivalent, both {{theoretically}} and empirically, to {{an increase}} of income for an individual consumer. But the equivalence does not empirically carry over to in-kind grants by a central government to a local one: this {{has been seen as}} an anomaly and dubbed the "flypaper effect. " We argue that the "anomaly" label is incorrect: the nonequivalence of increases in grants and community income is predicted, almost everywhere, by models that understand collective decision as the outcome of electoral competition among political parties. In addition, we compute politico-economic equilibria for a model with two independent tax parameters and obtain numerical values that agree with the existing empirical literature. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we argue}} that the case for {{universal}} compulsory education for sub-Saharan Africa might have been overstated. We capture the African situation through a heterogeneous-agent model, in which high costs of education relative to income and the skill premium cause the economy to stagnate in a low steady state with minimal educational attainment. We calibrate the model to available data from the sub-Saharan African countries to study education policies. We find that a tax and <b>in-kind</b> <b>subsidy</b> scheme that effectively redistributes resources from households with lower ability children to those with higher ability children outperforms enrollment-maximizing policies such as the abolition of child labor and compulsory education.

40|$|College tuition, as {{the price}} of higher {{education}} services, defies familiar economic analysis in important ways. It is recognized that tuition is a price that covers {{only a fraction of the}} cost of producing those educational services (about a third nationally), creating an <b>in-kind</b> <b>subsidy</b> for students, with the balance made up by large flows of donative resources from gifts, appropriations, and returns on wealth. This paper examines yet another important economic peculiarity of tuition. It takes seriously input and output markets implied by M. Rothschild and L. White (1995, "Journal of Political Economy") in which a single event, the student's matriculation, is simultaneously a transaction in both an input market, where a price is paid for a student's peer quality, and an output market, where a price is paid for the college's educational services. Those two prices are obscured by the fact that the peer wage is paid in the form of a discount on the price of educational services as well as by the fact that the schools ' sales (tuition...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we explore}} {{the effects of}} {{government}} <b>subsidies</b> (monetary and <b>in-kind)</b> in presidential elections in Chile in 1989 - 2000. Our dependent variable is the percentage of votes obtained by the incumbent. We use a panel with three periods (the elections of 1989, 1993 and 1999) and 228 counties. We correct for the potential simultaneity problem derived {{from the fact that}} an incumbent facing a difficult political scenario might react by increasing subsidies to improve his/her electoral performance. Our results indicate that the greater the government spending on these types of programs (measured by the percentage of the population that receives the subsidy), the higher the votes for the incumbent. When we separate monetary and <b>in-kind</b> <b>subsidies,</b> we find that only inkind subsidies are statistically significant. We estimate that to obtain an additional vote, the incumbent has to spend between US$ 1, 680 and US$ 1, 920 (measured in PPP) in government subsidies.

This paper examines yet another important economic peculiarity of tuition; it takes seriously input and output markets implied by Rothschild-White (1995 JPE) in which a single event - of a student's matriculation - is simultaneously a transaction in both an input market (where a wage is paid for a student's peer quality) and an output market (where a price is paid for the college's educational services). Those two prices are obscured by the fact that the peer wage is paid in the form of a discount on the price of educational services as well as by the fact that the schools' sales (tuition) revenues are significantly augmented by those donated resources. This framing sees a school's access to donated resources (wealth) critical in determining which market - peer quality inputs or educational services sales - will most influence its behavior. Apparent anomalies in the product market - like queues of unsatisfied customers that persist while schools refuse to expand capacity - disappear when they are seen to be the result of an input market where a queue of job applicants is used to allow the firm to select on worker - peer - quality (the result of an Akerlof-Yellen efficiency wage). ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is about}} the use of in-cash housing subsidy, in the form of housing voucher, to deliver housing welfare in Hong Kong. This type of subsidy is currently the major type of housing assistance implemented in the United States since 1970 s for improving the deteriorating public housing stock as well as the concentrated poverty and racial segregated neighbourhoods developed in the public housing projects. As a foreign policy, the research has taken the academic approach of policy transfer to assess the possibility of importing this American programme for domestic use. Housing subsidies exist in two forms, namely supply side (producer-based, <b>in-kind)</b> <b>subsidy</b> or demand side (consumer-based, in-cash) subsidy. The former refers to the direct construction of social housing by the government or private sector project facilitated by the government via financial incentives, such as construction grants or tax concessions. Hong Kong public housing is using this kind of provision. As for demand side subsidy, the beneficiaries receive financial support from the government in order to enhance the recipients’ affordability in housing. As far as renting is concerned, such kind of consumer subsidy can be rental allowance payable in cash or housing voucher redeemable by the landlord. The American Housing Choice Voucher Program is a prominent example. In 2001, the Hong Kong Housing Authority has also implemented a trial policy on disseminating rental allowances to eligible elderly public housing tenants but was called off later. If the program worked satisfactorily, the government would consider extending this policy to ordinary applicants of public housing as well. In-kind housing welfare is provided through administrative assignment, the prospective tenants cannot choose which area to reside and their choices on housing units are very restrictive. Since housing location will influence a person’s access to job, education and other chances of life, consumer based housing subsidy allows beneficiary to exercise greater freedom of choice in housing. Policy transfer is about borrowing foreign policy tools or measures for domestic use to solve problems of similar nature. It is a process by which knowledge about policies, administrative arrangements, institutions and ideas in one political system is used in the development of policies, administrative arrangements, institutions and ideas in another political system. In evaluating the implementation of housing voucher in Hong Kong, this dissertation using policy transfer theorists’ multi-level approach in evaluating the macro and micro settings of the policy framework. The macro level will look upon the political, social and economic contexts between U. S. and Hong Kong that embed public housing policy, while the micro level is an examination of the responses of selected actors in policy transfer that facilitate or hinder the transfer. Upon the research findings, both the macro and micro level analyses lead {{to the conclusion that the}} transferability of housing voucher system in Hong Kong is relatively low. published_or_final_versionHousing ManagementMasterMaster of Housing Managemen...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the {{domestic and international}} impacts of the United States' Export Enhancement Program (EEP) in the wheat market.

Theoretically, we argue that the EEP program cannot be a welfare improving trade policy for the U. S., even when considering strategic trade theory. We then model EEP as an in-kind, constrained targeted export subsidy and determine its price, quantity and budgetary effects. Our empirical results show that no exporting country gains from EEP and that the intended loser, the EC, is only slightly harmed. We find only a small increase in U.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the {{consequences}} children face when they lose a parent(s). After modeling the representative household’s bargaining process between their biological and orphaned children, the empirical section of this paper {{looks at the}} types of activities that children engage in, and the differences in educational outlays of host households between those children {{who have lost their}} parents and those who have not. The results indicate that orphanhood is of critical importance to human capital formation as the probability of engaging in child labor and being idle increases relative to school attendance, following the loss of both parents. This has the same distortionary effect as a tax on children as a result of orphanhood. Even though these children do not have markedly lower abilities to read, write or perform written calculation before the death of their parents, they are outperformed in all three categories once they join the new household following the loss of both parents. It concludes that for policymakers, <b>in-kind</b> <b>subsidies</b> provided at the school level will have a bigger impact than those provided at the household level. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the role of}} college selectivity in mobility decisions (both in-state and out-of-state) of freshmen students following Georgia's HOPE scholarship program. How did HOPE affect the selectivity of colleges attended by Georgia's freshmen students? Did it induce Georgia's freshmen students who would have otherwise attended more selective out-of-state colleges to instead attend less selective in-state ones? Or was there movement to more selective ones, both in-state and out-of-state? Using student residency and enrollment data from IPEDS and selectivity data from Barron's and Peterson's, we find that {{in the aftermath of}} HOPE, Georgia freshmen attended relatively more selective colleges overall. Disaggregating further, we find that Georgia freshmen attending in-state colleges attended more selective ones. Georgia freshmen attending out-of-state colleges {{were also more likely to}} attend more selective colleges, most likely due to an increase in the reservation price to go to out-of-state colleges following HOPE. Our results are robust to a variety of sensitivity checks and have important policy implications. In particular, Peltzman had observed in his classic 1973 paper that <b>in-kind</b> <b>subsidies</b> can induce individuals to invest in less quality-adjusted human capital than they might otherwise. The fact that Georgia freshmen attended relatively more selective colleges in the post-HOPE period allays, to some extent, the concern that state merit aid programs can adversely affect long-term outcomes and human capital formation...|$|R

We show that the economic effects of export bonus programs are significantly different when one includes the costs of acquiring these stocks. Including stock acquisition costs has the domestic price always rising, rather than an ambiguous effect of the traditional model of an export bonus program. We also show that including stock acquisition costs results in an export bonus scheme to be equivalent to cash export subsidies. When an export bonus program is combined with an existing target price scheme, government cost may either rise or fall in either model, but for different reasons. In an empirical simulation of the U. S.

Queensland {{is considered to be}} one of the nation’s major 'hotspots' for innovation and creative industry development. Australian contemporary music (abbreviated ACM for the purposes of this project) is an exciting genre encompassing immeasurable cultural influences from Australia's unique geography and history. This project investigates the efficacy of government subsidies to Queensland-based Australian contemporary music ensembles. A number of pertinent issues arise concerning the value of ACM to the community, the economy and Australian culture. Governmental, public and ACM practitioner perceptions of current funding allocations and systems are varied and often passionately held. A wide communication gulf exists between the ACM community and the funding bodies essential to their survival. As well, there seems to be a lack of cohesion within the ACM community itself. The music industry is a difficult field in which to earn a living. ACM ensembles are, almost without exception, run with <b>in-kind</b> support, government <b>subsidy</b> and occasional corporate sponsorship. Often, projects are financed from the groups’ own coffers.
