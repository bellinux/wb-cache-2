30|$|In addition, {{also the}} shape of S 10 curves {{pertaining}} to the highest multiples of σ shows evidences of a trend with increasing short-intense precipitation. In fact, {{as can be seen}} in Figs.  5 and 6, the curves have <b>flat</b> <b>portions</b> where at increasing time the rainfall amount and the σ level remain stationary. These <b>flat</b> <b>portions</b> are usually followed by steep segments of the curve. This characteristic progressively diminishes at decreasing σ multiples and is completely absent from S 60 curves. This feature could be partially due to the reduced sample of the S 10 time series, but it is also in accordance with the observed changing trends. In fact, because of the frequency of short duration and high intensity rainstorms, the moderate duration and intensity rainfalls are being progressively replaced by a complex concatenation of shorter but very intense episodes alterning with periods of no rain.|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{long-range}} spin-spin correlations {{on the structure}} of a <b>flat</b> <b>portion</b> in single-particle spectra ξ(p), which emerges beyond the point, where the Landau state loses its stability, is studied. We supplement the well-known Nozieres model of a Fermi system with limited scalar long-range forces by a similar long-range spin-dependent term and calculate the spectra versus its strength g. It is found that Nozieres results hold as long as g> 0. However, with g changing its sign, the spontaneous magnetization is shown to arise at any nonzero g. The increase of the strength |g| is demonstrated to result in shrinkage of the domain in momentum space, occupied by the <b>flat</b> <b>portion</b> of ξ(p), and, eventually, in its vanishing.

40|$|Objectives. This study {{sought to}} {{investigate}} the influence of stimulation site on {{the properties of the}} circuit in ventricular tachycardia. Background. A fully excitable gap can be demonstrated in most human ventricular tachycardias. This requires the presence of an arc of block so that the entire circuit can recover from refractoriness within the period of the cycle length. Resetting characterizes the conduction properties of the tissue within the ventricular tachycardia circuit. Previous studies have not investigated the possibility of site-dependent differences in the resetting response. Methods. Resetting was performed from the right ventricular apex and outflow tract in 23 patients. Two characteristics of the resetting response were analyzed: 1) the total duration of the <b>flat</b> <b>portion,</b> and 2) the slope of the increasing <b>portion.</b> Results. A <b>flat</b> <b>portion</b> of the resetting response was observed in 18 tachycardias; in 8 of the 18, there was a significant site-dependent difference (≥ 40 ms) in the duration of the <b>flat</b> <b>portion.</b> A significant site-dependent difference in the slope of the increasing portion of the resetting curve was seen in 6 of 22 tachycardias. In all, a stimulation site-dependent change in at least one characteristic of the resetting response was seen in 12 (52 %) of the 23 tachycardias. Conclusions. A stimulation site-dependent change in the <b>flat</b> <b>portion</b> of the resetting response is compatible with an arc of block that is at least partially functional in nature. A change in the slope of the increasing portion is compatible with either partially functional circuit barriers or variation in properties of conduction and refractoriness at different locations within the circuit, or both. These observations suggest that a spectrum of circuit properties may exist in humans, with a variable contribution of anatomic and functional characteristics...|$|R

This effect is due to the sudden removal of <b>flat</b> <b>portions</b> of the Fermi surface upon magnetic ordering. Within this picture, the Hall coefficient should scale as the square of the residual resistivity divided by the impurity concentration, which is consistent with available data.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that the {{key role in the}} {{mechanism}} of high-Tc superconductivity in the layered cuprate metal-oxides with anisotropic quasi-two-dimensional electronic spectrum and d-wave symmetry of the superconducting order parameter is played by the retarded screened Coulomb interaction and many-body correlations. We argue that the pseudogap observed in these materials is the anisotropic dielectric gap, which appears due to the electron-hole pairing on the <b>flat</b> <b>portions</b> of the Fermi surface {{in the vicinity of the}} extended saddle points in the quasiparticle spectrum. This gap coexists with the superconducting gap and is partially suppressed by scattering of current carriers on the charged point defects. The suppression of dielectric gap is analogous to the suppression of superconducting gap by magnetic impurities in «gapless» superconductors. The complete destruction of the pseudogap by charged impurities is assumed to increase Tc significantly...|$|E
