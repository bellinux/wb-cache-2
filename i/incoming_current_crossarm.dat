40|$|Graphene nanodisk is a {{graphene}} derivative with {{a closed}} edge. The trigonal zigzag nanodisk with size $N$ has $N$-fold degenerated zero-energy states. A nanodisk can be interpletted as a quantum dot with an internal degree of freedom. The grand state of nanodisk {{has been argued}} to be a quasi-ferromagnet, which is a ferromagnetic-like states with a finite but very long life time. We investigate the spin-filter effects in the system made of nanodisks and leads based on the master equation. The finite-size effect on spin filter is intriguing due to a reaction from the polarization of <b>incoming</b> <b>current</b> to a quasi-ferromagnet. Analyzing the relaxation process {{with the use of}} the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we explore the response to four types of <b>incoming</b> <b>currents,</b> namely, unpolarized current, perfectly polarized current, partially polarized current and pulse polarized current.

In the zero-field limit the control on current routing and partition can be achieved within a range of 10 %- 90 % of the total <b>incoming</b> <b>current</b> by tuning the carrier density at tilted intersections, or by modifying the relative magnitude of the bulk band gaps via gate voltage.

This semi analytical-numerical approach is versatile and allows for {{a significant reduction in}} computational effort for the analysis of fluid-riser interactions. The <b>incoming</b> <b>current</b> flow is assumed to be steady, uniform, unidirectional and perpendicular to the riser plane of initial equilibrium curvatures. The equations of riser 3 -D motion are based on a pinned-pinned, tensioned-beam or flexural cable, modelling which accounts for overall effects of riser bending, extensibility, sag, inclination and structural nonlinearities. The unsteady hydrodynamic forces associated with cross-flow and in-line vibrations are modelled as distributed van der Pol wake oscillators. This hydrodynamic model has been modified in order to capture the effect of varying initial curvatures of the inclined flexible cylinder and to describe the space-time fluctuation of lift and drag forces. Depending on the vortex-excited in-plane/out-of-plane modes and system fluid-structure parameters, the parametric studies are carried out to determine the maximum response amplitudes of catenary risers, along with the occurrence of uni-modal lock-in phenomenon. The obtained results highlight the effect of initial curvatures and geometric nonlinearities on the nonlinear dynamics of riser undergoing vortex-induced vibration...|$|R

Consequently, the efficiency of the turbine can be significantly increased by using a diffuser. The research community is investing considerable time and financial resources in this growing domain. The diffuser augmented tidal turbines research data is rather scarce due to their emerging nature, large and costly research and development setup, startup cost and proprietary issues.

CFD simulation is carried out to investigate velocity and mass flow rate at the throat. The drag force due to diffuser installation is also calculated.

An expression is given for determining the number of parameters of the equivalent diagramof a multipole depending on the number of poles. Unlike the generally known four-pole theory that can be used only if both <b>incoming</b> <b>currents</b> of the four-pole (and the same for both outgoing currents) are mutually equal, a so called generalized four-pole is considered, which does not comply with the so-called rule of regularity. In general case, the equivalent diagram of such a generalized, passive four-pole (that conforms to the reciprocity principle) should contain six passive elements unlike the “usual” regular four-pole, equivalent diagram of which needs only three resistances. Mathematical analogy of an electric circuit multipole and a charged system of bodies is shown.

40|$|Abstract: Southwest {{coastal waters}} of India (Arabian Sea) {{have a special}} {{environmental}} importance due {{to the formation of}} mud banks in southwest monsoon months. The present investigation in one of such mudbank regions indicated a possible subterranean flow from Vembanad Lake (Cochin Backwaters) that supplies primary nutrients to the adjacent coastal waters and precondition it for rich primary production during non-monsoon months. The activated trending faults in regions of submerged porous lime shell beds are probably coupling the adjacent watershed and the sea. Significance {{of this study is that}} subterranean flows could redefine the very concept of formation of mudbanks, which are presently recognized only as an oceanographic process. Unlike the existing theories, it is argued that formation of mudbanks are not entirely forced by coastal oceanographic processes; instead a remote forcing from the land involving a subterranean flow through the submerged coral beds, appears to be an initiative mechanism. The increased fresh water input through these passages stratifies the coastal waters by forming a surface lid of low saline waters, thereby diverting the <b>incoming</b> <b>currents</b> and wave energy to the bottom to disturb the bottom sediments. If the existence of the subterraneous channels linking Vembanad Lake to the adjacent coast is proved, it might even re-construct th...|$|R

Lett. 108, 136401 (2012) ] we have {{addressed}} the problem of a Luttinger liquid with a scatterer that allows for both coherent and incoherent scattering channels. We {{have found that the}} physics associated with this model is qualitatively different from the elastic impurity setup analyzed by Kane and Fisher, and from the inelastic scattering scenario studied by Furusaki and Matveev, thus proposing a new paradigmatic picture of Luttinger liquid with an impurity. Here we present an extensive study of the renormalization group flows for this problem, the fixed point landscape, and scaling near those fixed points. Our analysis is non-perturbative in the elastic tunneling amplitudes, employing an instanton calculation in {{one or two of the}} available elastic tunneling channels. Our analysis accounts for non-trivial Klein factors, which represent anyonic or fermionic statistics. These Klein factors need to be taken into account due to the fact that higher order tunneling processes take place. In particular we find a stable fixed point, where an <b>incoming</b> <b>current</b> is split 1 2 - 1 2 between a forward and a backward scattered beams.

40|$|Abstract: We {{calculate}} the fluorescence of electron spins {{confined to a}} plane and driven into resonance by a magnetic field gradient and a constant magnetic field applied {{at right angles to}} each other. We solve the equation of motion of two-dimensional electrons in the magnetic field gradient to derive the dispersion curve of spin oscillators, the amplitude of electron oscillations, the effective magnetic field sensed by the electron spin, and the rate at which electrons are injected from an electrode into spin oscillators. We then switch on the interaction between the spin magnetic dipole and the electromagnetic field to find the fluorescence power radiated by the individual spin oscillators. The rate of radiative decay is first derived, followed by the probability of sequential photon emission whereby a series of spontaneous decays occurs at random times separated by intervals during which the spin performs Rabi oscillations. The quantum correlations between random radiative decays manifest as bursts of emission at regular intervals along the wire. We integrate all multiphoton processes to obtain an exact analytical expression for the radiated electromagnetic power. The present theory obtains all parameters of the problem including magnetodipole coupling, the particle dwell time in the magnetic field gradient, and the spin polarization of the <b>incoming</b> <b>current.</b> The output power contains a fine structure arising from the anharmonicity of electron oscillations and from nonlinear optical effects which both give satellite emission peaks at odd multiples of the fundamental frequency...|$|R
