60|$|The girl moved {{a little}} {{so that she}} could see his face <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>from</b> the stove, and it was quietly stern, but the {{movement}} had served two purposes, for her own was now invisible.|$|E
6000|$|The unbelievers crowded to {{the house}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>from</b> the uncurtained windows. One of them stood tiptoe peering in while the others waited. [...] "It's chuck full," [...] he reported. [...] "No room for sinners, I reckon." ...|$|E
60|$|But when Queen Dew-Drop {{touched them}} with her wand, as they passed <b>in,</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> faded <b>from</b> their crowns, their robes became like {{withered}} leaves, and their wands were powerless.|$|R
60|$|The arm {{beneath his}} hand trembled, and he drew it unresistingly through his own. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> faint <b>light</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lamp {{opposite}} {{he saw her}} look at him.|$|R

60|$|The {{newcomer}} stood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>from</b> the window. He was a {{short and}} thick-set man, with iron-grey hair and black moustache slightly upturned. He had a pallid skin and keen grey eyes. His manner was at once grave and conciliatory.|$|E
60|$|A change went quickly {{over her}} face; she was unprepared. She {{looked down at}} him as he stood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>from</b> the window, holding the daffodils, the {{darkness}} behind. In his black clothes she again did not know him. She was almost afraid.|$|E
6000|$|The {{room was}} drab-colored and ill-ventilated--Kennicott did not [...] "believe in opening the windows so darn wide that you heat all outdoors." [...] The stale air seemed never to change. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>from</b> the hall {{they were two}} lumps of bedclothes with {{shoulders}} and tousled heads attached.|$|E

60|$|Once, {{while they}} were talking, I {{happened}} to catch Herky-Jerky's eye. He was {{lying on his back}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>from</b> the door. Herky winked at me, screwed up his face in the most astonishing manner, all of which I presently made out to mean that he wanted to speak to me. So I went over to him.|$|E
60|$|The {{room was}} only {{illuminated}} by the waning fire-light. A man was obscurely visible, seated on the sofa, with his elbows {{on his knees and}} his head resting on his hands. He looked up as the open door let <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>from</b> the library lamps. The mellow glow reached his face and revealed Julian Gray.|$|E
6000|$|I {{returned}} to the shop, and set down my glass on a marble slab with a careless clink. As I did so, Shaynor rose to his feet, his eyes fixed once more on the advertisement, where the young woman bathed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>from</b> the red jar simpered pinkly over her pearls. His lips moved without cessation. I stepped nearer to listen. [...] "And threw--and threw--and threw," [...] he repeated, his face all sharp with some inexplicable agony.|$|E
60|$|My quarry was plainly visible again, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{increasing}} <b>light</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> phosphorescent {{rock that}} lay embedded in great patches <b>in</b> <b>the</b> roughly arched {{roof of the}} cavern I had no difficulty in following him.|$|R

6000|$|At out {{eleven o'clock}} the {{following}} night an WANDA'S room on the [...] ground floor in Soho. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>from</b> one close-shaded [...] electric bulb the room is but dimly visible. A dying fire burns [...] on the left. A curtained window in {{the centre of the}} back wall. [...] A door on the right. The furniture is plush-covered and [...] commonplace, with a kind of shabby smartness. A couch, without [...] back or arms, stands aslant, between window and fire.|$|E
60|$|Captain Warfield untied his {{lashings}} {{and made}} his way over the bodies of the others. When his face became visible <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>from</b> the binnacle it was working with anger. They could see him speak, but the wind tore the sound away. He would not put his lips to Narii's ear. Instead, he pointed over the side. Narii Herring understood. His white teeth showed in an amused and sneering smile, and he stood up, a magnificent figure of a man.|$|E
60|$|But {{suddenly}} Pilkins {{came upon}} a youth sitting brave and, as if conflicting with summer sultriness, coatless, his white shirt-sleeves conspicuous <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>from</b> the globe of an electric. Close to his side was a girl, smiling, dreamy, happy. Around her shoulders was, palpably, the missing coat of the cold-defying youth. It {{appeared to be a}} modern panorama of the Babes in the Wood, revised and brought up to date, with the exception that the robins hadn't turned up yet with the protecting leaves.|$|E

60|$|Two days later, Andy {{was walking}} from the {{storehouse}} to <b>the</b> ship when, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dim <b>light</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lamp near the hut, {{he saw something}} unusual that attracted his attention.

60|$|The crowd {{melted away}} from the {{immediate}} vicinity of the prisoners. None seemed anxious {{to appear in the}} forefront as a possible leader of a mob that had so nearly lynched the only daughter of Jonas Prim. Burton slipped the noose from about the girl's neck and then turned toward her companion. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>from</b> the automobile lamps the man's face was distinctly visible to the detective {{for the first time that}} night, and as Burton looked upon it he stepped back with an exclamation of surprise.|$|E
60|$|She {{was aware}} that it was raining, for the fire-escape outside shone wet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>from</b> a window across the narrow court. She {{discovered}} she had left mackintosh and umbrella at the office. Stopping only to set out a clean towel, a spoon, and a glass on the chair by the bed, Una put on the old sweater which she secretly wore under her cheap thin jacket in winter. She lumbered wearily down-stairs. She prayed confusedly that God would give her back her headache and in reward make her mother well.|$|E
6000|$|He was gone. And {{she was not}} {{relieved}} by the quiet of the house. She was empty {{and the house was}} empty and she needed him. She wanted to go on talking, to get this threshed out, to build a sane friendship. She wavered down to the living-room, looked out of the bay-window. He was not to be seen. But Mrs. Westlake was. She was walking past, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>from</b> the corner arc-lamp she quickly inspected the porch, the windows. Carol dropped the curtain, stood with movement and reflection paralyzed. Automatically, without reasoning, she mumbled, [...] "I will see him again soon and make him understand we must be friends. But----The house is so empty. It echoes so." ...|$|E
60|$|She resisted, and {{he dropped}} her fingers. She remembered long how he stood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{scattered}} <b>light</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bright windows, a tall, black figure of dismay. She felt <b>the</b> yearning <b>in</b> his eyes. But her own response, warm {{half an hour}} since, was lifeless.|$|R
