50|$|Sometimes an <b>economizer</b> <b>circuit</b> is also {{installed}} {{to reduce}} the power required to keep a contactor closed; an auxiliary contact reduces coil current after the contactor closes. A somewhat greater amount of power is required to initially close a contactor than is required to keep it closed. Such a circuit can save {{a substantial amount of}} power and allow the energized coil to stay cooler. Economizer circuits are nearly always applied on direct-current contactor coils and on large alternating current contactor coils.|$|E
