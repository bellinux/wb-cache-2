50|$|The large {{value of}} the {{enthalpy}} of condensation of water vapor {{is the reason that}} steam is a far more effective <b>heating</b> <b>medium</b> than boiling water, and is more hazardous.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: As a {{new type}} of heating equipment, the <b>heat</b> <b>medium</b> heater furnace overcomes the {{shortage}} of the traditional heating methods such as the boiler, heating furnace. Through the comparison and analysis of the field application between the <b>heat</b> <b>medium</b> heater,YQWP- 4000 / 1. 6 / 220 / 180 - QT,and steam boiler in a central gathering station of Changqing oil field, results indicated: in the condition of 0. 3 MPa pressure and 200 ℃temperature above, the <b>heat</b> <b>medium</b> heater is higher thermal efficiency, more safety and security than steam boiler,and it do not pollute the environment and significantly save energy. One the <b>heat</b> <b>medium</b> heater saves by 982700 RMB than one set of steam boiler per each year. Due to the good economy, <b>heat</b> <b>medium</b> heater is suitable for the heating and heat supply of the large-scale central gathering station in the oil field. Thus, <b>heat</b> <b>medium</b> heater has a good application prospects. And the field application of the <b>heat</b> <b>medium</b> heater provides oil field energy saving and safe production with a certain reference in oil field...|$|R
50|$|Quality of heat: Often {{waste heat}} is of low quality (temperature). It can be {{difficult}} to efficiently utilize the quantity of low quality heat contained in a waste <b>heat</b> <b>medium.</b> <b>Heat</b> exchangers tend to be larger to recover significant quantities which increases capital cost.|$|R
40|$|As {{energy costs}} {{continue}} to increase, {{one must be}} willing to accept greater complexities in heat recovery systems. The days of being satisfied with only simple hot product to cold feed exchange, restricted to the plot boundaries of each unit, are a thing of the past. This paper presents results of a refinery-wide survey to identify potential high temperature heat sources that are not being recovered and low temperature systems that consume fuel. The best candidates in each category were connected by a circulating <b>heat</b> <b>medium</b> loop where waste heat is recovered for useful purposes. The <b>heat</b> <b>medium</b> chosen is turbine fuel. It is pumped around the refinery to pick up heat at the crude distilling unit, the hydrocracker, the catalytic cracker, and the coker; the heat is used to reboil a butylenes splitter column and to preheat boiler feed Water. The heat that is recovered is equivalent to some 660 B/D of fuel: at an illustrative fuel value of say $ 30 per barrel, the value of the recovered heat is $ 20, 000 per day. An energy conservation project at Shell's Norco (Louisiana) Manufacturing Complex involves several processing units and recovers heat that was previously lost to air or cooling water. The recovered heat is used to reboil a butylenes splitter column and to preheat boiler feed water. Essentially, the system consists of a circulating <b>heat</b> <b>medium</b> that transfers waste heat to heat consumers. The <b>heat</b> <b>medium</b> picks up <b>heat</b> from multiple donors and transfers it to multiple consumers...|$|R
50|$|Variable {{refrigerant}} flow (VRF), {{also known as}} variable refrigerant volume (VRV), is an HVAC technology invented in 1982. Like ductless minisplits VRFs use refrigerant as the cooling and <b>heating</b> <b>medium.</b> This refrigerant is conditioned by a single outdoor condensing unit, and is circulated within the building to multiple fan-coil units (FCUs).|$|E
5000|$|Thermocompression {{is useful}} {{whenever}} evaporator energy requirements {{need to be}} reduced. This could be achieved by compressing and recycling the vapor from a single-effects evaporator into the same evaporator as the <b>heating</b> <b>medium.</b> Thermocompression of vapor {{can be achieved by}} applying the steam-jet or by using mechanical means such as compressors ...|$|E
50|$|Fluidized bed systems use sand or {{aluminium}} oxide (alumina) as <b>heating</b> <b>medium.</b> They apply pyrolysis and oxidation simultaneously. These systems clean fast, from 30 minutes process time {{up to two}} hours. The medium does not melt or boil, nor emit any vapors or odors. Thermal shock {{can be a problem}} with some parts. Pollution control devices may be needed to protect the environment.|$|E
50|$|Shape-memory alloys {{can also}} be used to recover low {{temperature}} waste heat and convert it to mechanical action or electricity. A WHRB is different from a Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) in the sense that the <b>heated</b> <b>medium</b> does not change phase.|$|R

Possible applications include treatment of liquified natural gas in cities to bring the gas on-line quickly, conversion of liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen for steel mills, and high volume inert purging...|$|R
50|$|This type of {{evaporator}} {{is generally}} made of 4 - 8 m) tubes enclosed by steam jackets. The uniform {{distribution of the}} solution is important when using this type of evaporator. The solution enters and gains velocity as it flows downward. This gain in velocity is attributed to the vapor being evolved against the <b>heating</b> <b>medium,</b> which flows downward as well. This evaporator is usually applied to highly viscous solutions, so it is frequently used in the chemical,sugar, food, and fermentation industries.|$|E
5000|$|The early {{technique}} of hot blast used iron for the regenerative <b>heating</b> <b>medium.</b> Iron caused problems with expansion and contraction, which stressed the iron and caused failure. Edward Alfred Cowper developed the Cowper stove in 1857. [...] This stove used firebrick as a storage medium, solving the expansion and cracking problem. The Cowper stove was also {{capable of producing}} high heat, which resulted in very high throughput of blast furnaces. The Cowper stove is still used in today's blast furnaces.|$|E
5000|$|Vapor-compression {{evaporation}} is the evaporation {{method by}} which a blower, compressor or jet ejector is used to compress, and thus, increase {{the pressure of the}} vapor produced. Since the pressure increase of the vapor also generates an increase in the condensation temperature, the same vapor can serve as the <b>heating</b> <b>medium</b> for its [...] "mother" [...] liquid or solution being concentrated, from which the vapor was generated to begin with. If no compression was provided, the vapor would be at the same temperature as the boiling liquid/solution, and no heat transfer could take place.|$|E
50|$|The typical <b>heat</b> {{exchange}} <b>medium</b> for feolite {{storage is}} air.|$|R
5000|$|Regenerators {{exchange}} {{heat from}} one process fluid to an intermediate solid <b>heat</b> storage <b>medium,</b> then that <b>medium</b> exhanges <b>heat</b> {{with a second}} process fluid flow. The two flows are either separated in time, alternately circulating through the storage medium, or are separated in space and the <b>heat</b> storage <b>medium</b> is moved between the two flows.|$|R
40|$|According to some embodiments, {{the present}} {{provides}} a <b>heat</b> transfer <b>medium</b> that includes, {{but is not}} limited to a base fluid, a plurality of single-walled carbon nanotubes, and a gelling formulation formed of an amine surfactant, an intercalating agent, and an oxygen-bearing solvent. The <b>heat</b> transfer <b>medium</b> is adapted for improved thermal conductivity with respect to the base fluid...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the heating}} stage, the treated liquid is first {{pre-heated}} to a non-critical temperature (70-80°C for milk), {{and then quickly}} heated to the temperature required by the process. There {{are two types of}} heating technologies: direct, where the product is put in a direct contact with the hot steam, and indirect, where the product and the <b>heating</b> <b>medium</b> remain separated by the equipment's contact surfaces. The main goals of the design, both from product quality and from efficiency standpoints, are to maintain the high product temperature for the shortest period possible, and to ensure that the temperature is evenly distributed throughout.|$|E
50|$|Heated screw {{systems are}} also an {{indirect}} heated system. Typically {{they use a}} jacketed trough with a double auger that intermeshes. The augers themselves frequently contain passages for the <b>heating</b> <b>medium</b> to increase the heat transfer surface area. Some systems use electric resistance heaters instead of a heat transfer media and may employ a single auger in each housing. The augers can range from 12 to 36 inches in diameter for full scale systems, with lengths up to 20 feet. The auger/trough assemblies can be connected in parallel and/or series to increase throughput. Full scale capabilities up to 4 tons per hour have been demonstrated. This type of system has been most successful treating refinery wastes.|$|E
50|$|The {{solution}} containing the desired product is {{fed into the}} evaporator and passes across a heat source. The applied heat converts {{the water in the}} solution into vapor. The vapor is removed {{from the rest of the}} solution and is condensed while the now-concentrated solution is either fed into a second evaporator or is removed. The evaporator, as a machine, generally consists of four sections. The heating section contains the <b>heating</b> <b>medium,</b> which can vary. Steam is fed into this section. The most common medium consists of parallel tubes but others have plates or coils typically made from copper or aluminium. The concentrating and separating section removes the vapor being produced from the solution. The condenser condenses the separated vapor, then the vacuum or pump provides pressure to increase circulation.|$|E

40|$|DE 102008048655 A 1 UPAB: 20100331 NOVELTY - The {{system has}} a {{transport}} network, a <b>heat</b> transfer <b>medium,</b> where thermodynamic state and/or physical- and/or chemical-properties {{of the medium}} are changed by heat absorption at a heat source. The <b>heat</b> transfer <b>medium</b> is arranged in a container (2) in an enclosed manner, where the container has a heat-conducting internal structure that allows thermal conduction between the <b>medium</b> and <b>heat</b> source and/or a heat sink.

5000|$|Conventional Jackets. A second {{shell is}} {{installed}} over {{a portion of}} the vessel, creating an annular space within which cooling or <b>heating</b> <b>medium</b> flows. A simple conventional jacket, with no internal components, is generally very inefficient for heat transfer because the flow media has an extremely low velocity resulting in a low heat transfer coefficient. Condensing media, such as steam or Dowtherm A, is an exception because in this case the heat transfer coefficient doesn't depend on velocity or turbulence, but instead is related to the surface area upon which the media condenses and the efficiency of removing condensate. Internals include baffles that direct flow in a spiral pattern around the jacket, and agitating nozzles that cause high turbulence {{at the point where the}} fluid is introduced into the jacket.|$|E
50|$|The {{combination}} of climbing and falling film evaporator allows the evaporator to operate within a wide temperature range. The evaporators can {{operate in a}} small temperature difference between the <b>heating</b> <b>medium</b> and the liquid. This {{is due to the}} lack of hydrostatic pressure drop in the evaporator. The lack of hydrostatic pressure drop will eliminate the temperature drop thus causing the temperature to be relatively uniform. Besides that, the local heat transfer coefficient inside the tube is depending on the change in temperature. A minimum threshold of change in temperature (ΔT) of 5 °C was found by Luopeng Yang in one of his experiments. If the change in temperature is less than 5 °C, the liquid film will not be able to travel up the tubes which resulting in a drop of local heat transfer coefficient in the tube.|$|E
5000|$|Yushō disease (...) (literally oil symptoms) was a mass {{poisoning}} by {{polychlorinated biphenyls}} (PCBs) which occurred in northern Kyūshū, Japan in 1968. In January 1968, rice bran oil produced by Kanemi Company in Kyushu was contaminated with PCBs and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) during production. For deodorization, the oil was heated using PCB as the <b>heating</b> <b>medium,</b> circulating through pipes. Due to {{holes in the}} pipes the PCB leaked into the rice bran oil. The contaminated rice bran oil was then sold to poultry farmers {{for use as a}} feed supplement and to consumers for use in cooking. In February to March 1968, farmers started reporting that their poultry were dying due to apparent difficulty in breathing; altogether 400,000 birds died. About 14,000 people who had consumed the contaminated rice oil were affected in Japan. Of them 500 dies. Common symptoms included dermal and ocular lesions, irregular menstrual cycles and a lowered immune response. Other symptoms included fatigue, headache, cough, and unusual skin sores. Additionally, in children, there were reports of poor cognitive development.|$|E

50|$|Fouling also {{occurs when}} hard {{deposits}} {{form on the}} surfaces of the <b>heating</b> <b>mediums</b> in the evaporators. In foods, proteins and polysaccharides can create such deposits that reduce the efficiency of heat transfer. Foaming can also create a problem since dealing with the excess foam can be costly in time and efficiency. Antifoam agents are to be used, {{but only a few}} can be used when food is being processed.|$|R

50|$|The heat {{transfer}} coefficient on the evaporating side of the tube is mostly determined by the hydrodynamic flow conditions of the film. For low mass flows or high viscosities the film flow can be laminar, in which case {{heat transfer}} is controlled purely by conduction through the film. Therefore in this condition the {{heat transfer coefficient}} decreases with increased mass flow. With increased mass flow the film becomes wavy laminar and then turbulent. Under turbulent conditions the heat transfer coefficient increases with increased flow.Evaporation takes place at very low mean temperature differences between <b>heating</b> <b>medium</b> and process stream, typically between 3 - 6K, therefore these devices are ideal for heat recovery in multi stage processes.A further advantage of the falling film evaporator is the very short residence time of the liquid {{and the absence of}} superheating of the same. Not considering the vapour separator, the residence time inside the tubes is measured in seconds, making it ideal for heat-sensitive products such as milk, fruit juice, pharmaceuticals, and many others.Falling film evaporators are also characterised by very low pressure drops; therefore, they are often used in deep vacuum applications.|$|E
5000|$|In ancient alchemy, a protoscience {{that contributed}} to the {{development}} of modern chemistry and medicine, alchemists developed a structure of basic laboratory techniques, theory, terminology, and experimental methods. Sublimation was used to refer to the process in which a substance is heated to a vapor, then immediately collects as sediment on the upper portion and neck of the <b>heating</b> <b>medium</b> (typically a retort or alembic), but {{can also be used to}} describe other similar non-laboratory transitions. It is mentioned by alchemical authors such as Basil Valentine and George Ripley, and in the Rosarium philosophorum, as a process necessary for the completion of the magnum opus. Here, the word sublimation is used to describe an exchange of [...] "bodies" [...] and [...] "spirits" [...] similar to laboratory phase transition between solids and gases. Valentine, in his Triumphal Chariot of Antimony (published 1678) makes a comparison to spagyrics in which a vegetable sublimation can be used to separate the spirits in wine and beer. Ripley uses language more indicative of the mystical implications of sublimation, indicating that the process has a double aspect in the spiritualization of the body and the corporalizing of the spirit. He writes: ...|$|E
50|$|In general {{evaporation}} {{takes place}} inside vertical tubes, {{but there are}} also applications where the process fluid evaporates on the outside of horizontal or vertical tubes. In all cases, the process fluid to be evaporated flows downwards by gravity as a continuous film. The fluid will create a film along the tube walls, progressing downwards (falling) - hence the name.The fluid distributor has to be designed carefully in order to maintain an even liquid distribution for all tubes along which the solution falls. A typical distributor is shown in Fig. 2; these distributors are usually called ferrules due to their concentric shape.In the majority of applications the <b>heating</b> <b>medium</b> is placed {{on the outside of the}} tubes. High heat transfer coefficients are required in order to achieve equally balanced heat transfer resistances. Therefore, condensing steam is commonly used as a heating medium.For internally evaporating fluids, separation between the liquid phase (the solution) and the gaseous phase takes place inside the tubes. In order to maintain conservation of mass as this process proceeds, the downward vapor velocity increases, increasing the shear force acting on the liquid film and therefore also the velocity of the solution. The result can be a high film velocity of a progressively thinner film resulting in increasingly turbulent flow. The combination of these effects allows very high heat transfer coefficients.|$|E
