50|$|In 1979, {{a review}} group {{published}} a report after being {{formed by the}} Department of Health and Social Services and the Northern Ireland Office {{to look at the}} future of the Probation Service. The group was headed by Sir Harold Black. It recommended that the Probation Service remain as a separate service focusing on dealing with offenders and serving the courts. It also recommended that the Probation Service should be administered by a board drawn from the whole community and that a written code of practice should be <b>drawn</b> up <b>for</b> <b>approval</b> by the courts and the Secretary of State.|$|R

40|$|The present {{research}} examines need <b>for</b> <b>approval</b> from social networks {{in regards to}} an individual's relationship as a dispositional trait, varying at individual levels. In order to explore trait-level need <b>for</b> <b>approval,</b> associations between need <b>for</b> <b>approval</b> and other dispositional-level traits were examined, including self-esteem, attachment dimensions, personality traits, including extraversion, neuroticism, and agreeableness, collectivistic and individualistic orientations, and the dimensions of autonomy and sociotropy. Measurement of need <b>for</b> <b>approval</b> involved an original scale construction. Two-hundred eighty participants completed a web-based questionnaire. Significant associations were identified between dispositional-need <b>for</b> <b>approval</b> and individualism, collectivism, attachment avoidance, sociotropy, extraversion (including its facet of warmth), and agreeableness. These results suggest that need <b>for</b> <b>approval</b> from social networks is distinct, but related to individual difference dimensions...|$|R

40|$|The {{literature}} cited {{points to}} an increase in sexual permissiveness among females which may be a function of their need <b>for</b> <b>approval.</b> It was hypothesized that there is a relationship between need <b>for</b> <b>approval</b> and sexual liberalism. In addition, several other aspects of female sexual attitudes and their relationship to need <b>for</b> <b>approval</b> were examined in the present study. Specifically, need <b>for</b> <b>approval</b> was hypothesized to be related to sexual satisfaction, sexual libido (drive), and sexual prudishness. In order to establish the relationship between need <b>for</b> <b>approval</b> and aspects of female sexuality the effects of religiosity must be considered. Previous studies cited in the literature indicate that religiosity is an important covariate in relation to sexual attitudes and behaviors (Cardwell, 1969; Deadman, 1959; Heltsley 2 ̆ 6 Broderick, 1969; Kinsey, 1953). Therefore, the above hypotheses were investigated statistically controlling for the effects of religiosity...|$|R

This study examined the need <b>for</b> <b>approval</b> from social networks pertaining to intimate relationships across the variables of attachment theory of avoidance and anxiety, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism, self-esteem, individualism, collectivism, sociotropy, and autonomy. A scale was devised to assess need <b>for</b> <b>approval</b> from their social network. A survey was completed by college students giving ratings for all the variables and the dependent variable of need <b>for</b> <b>approval.</b> Results indicated that collectivism, individualism, sociotropy, avoidance, extraversion, and agreeableness were each significantly associated with need <b>for</b> <b>approval...</b>|$|R
