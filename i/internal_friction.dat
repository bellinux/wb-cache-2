40|$|By {{considering}} turning {{vehicles of}} a platoon that travels on arterial link, a new procedure for calibrating dispersion parameter α of Robertson's model is proposed. Upstream edge of channelized section is {{served as the}} boundary and the link between two adjacent intersections {{is divided into two}} sections, which are road section and channelized section. Typical investigation site is selected in Changchun city and data are collected to study the relationship between α and <b>internal</b> <b>frictions,</b> such as traffic volume and turning proportion. Double Gaussian function and logistic function are used to fit the curves among optimum values of α and <b>internal</b> <b>frictions</b> in the two sections, respectively, which allow the determination of α that varies as the volumes and turning proportions change. The study results are of great importance for arterial progression because Robertson's model can depict platoon movements more accurately using the calibrated values of α...|$|R

25|$|The most {{important}} consideration in proper design and installation of retaining walls {{is to recognize}} and counteract the tendency of the retained material to move downslope due to gravity. This creates lateral earth pressure behind the wall which depends on the angle of <b>internal</b> <b>friction</b> (phi) and the cohesive strength (c) of the retained material, {{as well as the}} direction and magnitude of movement the retaining structure undergoes.|$|E
25|$|Soil is an {{assemblage}} of particles that have little to no cementation while rock (such as sandstone) may consist of an assembly of particles that are strongly cemented together by chemical bonds. The shear strength of soil is primarily due to interparticle friction and therefore, the shear resistance on a plane is approximately proportional to the effective normal stress on that plane. The angle of <b>internal</b> <b>friction</b> is thus {{closely related to the}} maximum stable slope angle, often called the angle of repose.|$|E

50|$|The schemes of the Sith {{are key to}} the {{overarching}} plot of the Star Wars films and much other fictional material in the franchise. Frequently opposed by the Jedi, the Sith have also been stymied at crucial junctures by <b>internal</b> <b>frictions.</b> The notion that the Sith’s dark arts and selfish philosophy are ultimately self-defeating on both a personal and institutional level is a running theme within Star Wars media.|$|R
50|$|Due to <b>internal</b> <b>frictions</b> {{within the}} {{alliance}} (as well as given the somewhat inconsistent and turbulent governing from 1996 to 2000), the PNL {{withdrawn from the}} CDR prior to the 2000 general elections. Nonetheless, PNȚCD and other parties ran on the CDR 2000 common list for these elections. The alliance did not manage to score the same positive results as during the 1990s and, consequently, shortly disbanded since it did not pass the electoral threshold.|$|R
25|$|As Wheatley diversified {{into other}} {{management}} and radio interests, Goble stepped up his influence in Little River Band. He recruited bassist Wayne Nelson {{to replace the}} departing McArdle and to undertake some lead vocal work. Beatles producer George Martin agreed to produce the next album Time Exposure. The recording sessions in Montserrat were tumultuous as <b>internal</b> <b>friction</b> rended the band. Yet the resulting album was a huge success, reaching the Top 10 and gold record status in the USA. Subsequently, Stephen Housden replaced Briggs on lead guitar.|$|E
25|$|In 1805, the {{population}} of Cairo rebelled. This provided {{a chance for the}} Mamluks to seize power, but <b>internal</b> <b>friction</b> prevented them from exploiting this opportunity. In 1806, the Mamluks defeated the Turkish forces in several clashes. in June the rival parties concluded an agreement by which Muhammad Ali, (appointed as governor of Egypt on 26 March 1806), was to be removed and authority returned to the Mamluks. However, they were again unable to capitalize on this opportunity due to discord between factions. Muhammad Ali retained his authority.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} {{resources of the}} Athenian State were not excessive. All the glory of Athens in the Age of Pericles, its constructions, public works, religious buildings, sculptures, etc. {{would not have been}} possible without the treasury of the Delian League. The treasury was originally held on the island of Delos but Pericles moved it to Athens under the pretext that Delos wasn't safe enough. This resulted in <b>internal</b> <b>friction</b> within the league and the rebellion of some city-states that were members. Athens retaliated quickly and some scholars believe this to be the period wherein it would be more appropriate to discuss an Athenian Empire instead of a league.|$|E
40|$|The optimal {{stabilization}} of a rigid body motion without angular velocity measurements is considered {{with the help}} of three internal rotors that effected by <b>internal</b> <b>frictions.</b> In this paper, the orientation of the body will be described in terms of the Modified Rodrigues parameters (MRPs). The optimal control law which stabilizes asymptotically this motion and minimizes the require like-energy cost is obtained in terms of the MRPs. Numerical study and simulation are introduced...|$|R
50|$|Penny {{appears to}} have joined the Incorporated Society of Artists in 1762; but with Benjamin West, Richard Wilson, and others, then withdrew because of <b>internal</b> <b>frictions.</b> In December 1768 he was {{nominated}} one of the foundation members of the Royal Academy of Arts, and its first professor of painting. He then ceased to exhibit, and was obliged by ill-health to resign the professorship of painting, {{in which he was}} succeeded by James Barry.|$|R
40|$|Quasi {{static and}} dynamic {{uniaxial}} compression tests {{were performed on}} dumb-bell shaped specimen of a grade of graphite. The fracture {{of this kind of}} materiel is strain rate dependent. Indeed, we achieved two clearly different strengths. The graphite is less scattered compared to the ceramics. Its fracture seems brittle. However its mechanical behaviour is quasi linear elastic viscoplastic. At room temperature, this viscoplasticity can be explained because of the exhibition of two combined physical phenomenon : glide motions of dislocations and mainly growth of microcracks slowed down by <b>internal</b> <b>frictions...</b>|$|R
25|$|James Clerk Maxwell {{published}} a famous paper in 1866 using the kinetic theory of gases to study gaseous viscosity. To {{understand why the}} viscosity is independent of pressure, consider two adjacent boundary layers (A and B) moving with respect to each other. The <b>internal</b> <b>friction</b> (the viscosity) of the gas {{is determined by the}} probability a particle of layer A enters layer B with a corresponding transfer of momentum. Maxwell's calculations show that the viscosity coefficient is proportional to the density, the mean free path, and the mean velocity of the atoms. On the other hand, the mean free path is inversely proportional to the density. So an increase in density due to an increase in pressure doesn't result in any change in viscosity.|$|E
25|$|His first {{published}} papers, {{which appeared in}} 1842 and 1843, were on the steady motion of incompressible fluids and some cases of fluid motion. These were followed in 1845 by one on the friction of fluids in motion and the equilibrium and motion of elastic solids, and in 1850 by another {{on the effects of}} the <b>internal</b> <b>friction</b> of fluids on the motion of pendulums. To the theory of sound he made several contributions, including a discussion of the effect of wind on the intensity of sound and an explanation of how the intensity is influenced {{by the nature of the}} gas in which the sound is produced. These inquiries together put the science of fluid dynamics on a new footing, and provided a key not only to the explanation of many natural phenomena, such as the suspension of clouds in air, and the subsidence of ripples and waves in water, but also to the solution of practical problems, such as the flow of water in rivers and channels, and the skin resistance of ships.|$|E
500|$|The Clash were an English {{punk rock}} band formed in London, England in 1976 {{as part of}} the {{original}} wave of British punk. Along with punk, their music incorporated elements of reggae, dub, funk, ska and rockabilly. For most of their recording career the Clash consisted of Joe Strummer (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Mick Jones (lead guitar, lead vocals), Paul Simonon (bass guitar, vocals) and Nicky [...] "Topper" [...] Headon (drums, percussion). Headon left the group in 1982, and <b>internal</b> <b>friction</b> led to Jones' departure the following year. The group continued with new members, but finally disbanded in early 1986.|$|E
5000|$|After meeting Richard Cuthbert in Berlin in 2011 Guglielmino started {{planning}} a cassette only release with Cuthbert. The release was delayed due to several setbacks involving Cuthbert and Guglielmino's management firms who both {{disagreed with the}} intended format. Cuthbert's training as a lawyer eventually allowed both artists to receive approval from their firms for release, with a slight compromise, the cassettes had to include download codes. The press release for the cassette and tour was revealing of the <b>internal</b> <b>frictions</b> including quotes from their management firms criticising the release.|$|R

50|$|Those <b>internal</b> <b>frictions</b> {{continually}} threatened (or sometimes may, paradoxically, have spurred) the Umayyad ever-expanding military {{effort in}} al-Andalus during the conquest period. Circa 739, on learning {{the news of}} Charles Martel's second intervention in Provence, Uqba ibn al-Hajjaj had to call off an expedition to the Lower Rhone {{in order to deal}} with the Berber Revolt in the south instead. Later next year, the Berber garrisons stationed in León, Astorga and other north-western outposts gave up their positions, and some of them even embraced the Christian religion. The Muslim settlement was thereafter established permanently south of the Douro's banks.|$|R
500|$|With Hitler's approval, Himmler re-established the Einsatzgruppen in the lead-up to {{the planned}} {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union. In March 1941, Hitler addressed his army leaders, detailing his intention to smash the Soviet Empire and destroy the Bolshevik intelligentsia and leadership. His special directive, the [...] "Guidelines in Special Spheres re Directive No. 21 (Operation Barbarossa)", read: [...] "In the operations area of the army, the Reichsführer-SS has been given special tasks on the orders of the Führer, in order to prepare the political administration. These tasks arise from the forthcoming final struggle of two opposing political systems. Within the framework of these tasks, the Reichsführer-SS acts independently and on his own responsibility." [...] Hitler thus intended to prevent <b>internal</b> <b>friction</b> like that occurring earlier in Poland in 1939, when several German Army generals had attempted to bring Einsatzgruppen leaders to trial for the murders they had committed.|$|E
500|$|However, {{during the}} American {{leg of the}} tour, <b>internal</b> <b>friction</b> started to form between {{the members of the}} trio. Deborah Frost, writing for Rolling Stone, noticed [...] "an ever {{widening}} personal gulf" [...] between the band members, and quoted Harvey as saying [...] "It makes me sad. I wouldn't have got here without them. I needed them back then – badly. But I don't need them anymore. We all changed as people." [...] Despite the tour's personal downsides, footage from live performances was compiled and released on the long-form video Reeling with PJ Harvey (1993). The band's final tour was to support U2 in August 1993, after which the trio officially disbanded. In her final appearance on American television in September 1993 on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Harvey performed a solo version of [...] "Rid of Me." [...] As Rid of Me sold substantially more copies than Dry, 4-Track Demos, a compilation album of demos for the album was released in October and inaugurated her career as a solo artist. In early 1994, it was announced that U2's manager, Paul McGuinness, had become her manager.|$|E
500|$|The {{sea state}} of the ocean is {{determined}} by the size of these waves, which—on the open ocean—depends upon the wind speed and the fetch, the distance over which the wind blows upon the water. The smallest waves are called ripples, strongly affected by surface tension. As strong and prolonged winds push against ripples' raised crests, larger and more irregular waves form, which are known as seas. These waves reach their maximum height when the rate at which they are traveling nearly matches the speed of the wind. As the wind drops, the waves remain as swell and, over time, they naturally separate into long, powerful waves with a common direction and wavelength. These swells can travel over large distances—even half the globe—and originate particularly often from the Roaring Forties of the Southern Hemisphere where the wind blows continuously. When the wind dies down, ripples easily disappear owing to water's <b>internal</b> <b>friction</b> (viscosity), but longer waves in seas and swells are only (very) slowly reduced by viscosity. Constructive interference, however, can also cause individual (unexpected) rogue waves much higher than normal. Most waves are less than [...] high and {{it is not unusual for}} strong storms to double or triple that height; offshore construction such as wind farms and oil platforms use metocean statistics from measurements in computing the wave forces (due to for instance the hundred-year wave) they are designed against. Rogue waves, however, have been documented at heights above [...]|$|E
50|$|However, {{there were}} <b>internal</b> <b>frictions</b> {{in the company}} that Gray was {{nominally}} in charge of.

By early 1906 Malcomson was effectively frozen out of the Ford Motor Company, and in May sold his shares to Henry Ford. John S. Gray died unexpectedly in 1906, and his position as Ford's president was taken over by Ford himself soon afterward.|$|R
50|$|The {{core of the}} Democratic Party is made up by {{the members}} of the Freedom Union (Unia Wolności, UW), which had so far been the most {{important}} Christian democratic group in the Polish political landscape. Since its inception in 1994, the UW had to cope with <b>internal</b> <b>frictions</b> between various factions: liberal socialists (such as Leszek Balcerowicz), those proposing a more liberal economic agenda in a more conservative, bourgeois guise (such as Donald Tusk), more progressive social democrats such as Jacek Kuroń, and intellectual former civil rights activists such as Bronisław Geremek or Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who also has a strong background in liberal Catholicism and leans towards Christian democracy.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to determine, by means of discrete element simulations of ice floes, information {{that could be used}} for continuum modelling of broken ice covers on waterways. The ice floes or 'particles' were modelled as random-sized circular disks. The <b>internal</b> angles of <b>friction</b> for cohesionless assemblies of particles under compression were determined using molecular dynamics type simulations of biaxial tests. Constant confining pressures as well as constant displacement rates were used for the biaxial tests. Stress-strain curves were obtained for a range of confining pressures. The yield envelopes were found to be represented by a Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion. The effect of the interparticle friction coefficient on the global angle of friction was examined. It was found that the <b>internal</b> angle of <b>friction</b> was essentially independent of the interparticle friction angle. Furthermore, assemblies with different particle size distributions were used in order to investigate the effects of this parameter on the <b>internal</b> angle of <b>friction.</b> It was found that as the particle size distribution is made wider, the magnitude of the <b>internal</b> angle of <b>friction</b> increases. Angle of repose simulations were performed in order to verify the <b>internal</b> angles of <b>friction</b> results. It is found that the angles of repose measured are in rough agreement with, but slightly higher than, the values found for the <b>internal</b> angles of <b>friction</b> in the biaxial tests. Finally, biaxial tests were performed on assemblies in which bonds were introduced between the particles in order to simulate an intact ice cover. Results were consistent with a cohesive Mohr-Coulomb material...|$|R

Following this news, Zille further defended herself by noting that Nelson Mandela had held the same opinion about colonialism. Her continued defence of her comments exacerbated <b>internal</b> <b>friction</b> in the Democratic Alliance between her and her detractors, and was seen to undermine the party leader, Maimane. Maimane stated that the disciplinary charges against Zille were not limited to Twitter, and included [...] "a series of comments [...] that have exacerbated and amplified the original tweet”. Some of her subsequent writings, in which she defended her views, have increasingly strained her relationship with Maimane.|$|E
