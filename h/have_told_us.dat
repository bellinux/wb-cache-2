In response, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Jiang Yu issued a protest. The spokesman of the Ministry of External Affairs of the Government of India responded by saying that “The Chinese had concerns but we are going by what the Vietnamese authorities <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> and have conveyed this to the Chinese.” The Indo-Vietnamese deal was also denounced by the Chinese state-run newspaper Global Times.|$|E
500|$|Mars Attacks! drew mixed {{responses}} from critics. Based on 63 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, 52% of the reviewers enjoyed the film, {{with an average}} score of 5.9/10. By comparison, Metacritic calculated an average score of 52/100 from 19 reviews. Roger Ebert observed the homages to the 1950s science fiction B movies. [...] "Ed Wood himself could <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> what's wrong with this movie: the makers felt superior to the material. To be funny, even schlock has to believe in itself. Look for Infra-Man (1975) or Invasion of the Bee Girls (1973) {{and you will find}} movies that lack stars and big budgets and fancy special effects but are funny and fun in a way that Burton's megaproduction never really understands." ...|$|E

We redesigned these computers {{from the ground up}} with the features customers <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> they value most." [...] Apple's new pricing strategy caused concern among investors, who thought it would reduce profit margins. Brodie Keast, an Apple product marketing manager, said, [...] "We are prepared {{to do whatever it takes}} to reach more people with Macintosh.... The plan is to get as aggressive on price as we need to be." [...] After the release of the Classic, Apple's share price closed at $27.75 per share, down 50cents from October 12, 1990, and far below its previous 12-month high of $50.37.|$|E

An eminent author, David Marr, <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> the PM is motivated primarily by anger, stemming from a traumatic period in his childhood.

This is the man who a year ago was still enjoying record approval ratings, having won a sweeping election victory eighteen months earlier. His prolonged honeymoon was accompanied by extravagant flattery, praising his political genius, his capacious work ethic, his ability to mix social vision with practical politics.

500|$|During writing, a Pixar {{employee}} noted to Jim Reardon that EVE was {{reminiscent of}} the dove with the olive branch from the story of Noah's Ark, and the story was reworked with EVE finding a plant to return humanity from its voyage. WALL-E himself {{has been compared to}} Prometheus, Sisyphus, and Butades: in an essay discussing WALL-E as representative of the artistic strive of Pixar itself, Hrag Vartanian compared WALL-E to Butades in a scene where the robot expresses his love for EVE by making a sculpture of her from spare parts. [...] "The Ancient Greek tradition associates the birth of art with a Corinthian maiden who longing to preserve her lover's shadow traces it on the wall before he departed for war. The myth reminds us that art was born out of longing and often means more for the creator than the muse.

500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the season, {{speculation}} intensified {{about which}} players might enter professional football though the 2008 NFL Draft. [...] In November, Jamaal Charles said he would return for his senior season rather than enter professional football in the NFL. [...] In December, sources reported Charles and Jermichael Finley had filed paperwork with the NFL to evaluate their draft potential if they decided to enter professional football in the NFL Draft instead of returning for their senior season. [...] Quan Cosby, who spent three years in professional baseball, was reported to be still deciding whether to file the paperwork. [...] Defensive tackle Roy Miller said he would definitely be back for his senior season. [...] Mack Brown did not comment about specific players but said, [...] "We always try to help our guys get as much information as possible {{when it comes to the}} NFL. We encourage and help them go through the process ... All of our underclassmen <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> they will be coming back, but if you're playing well enough to be considered an NFL prospect, going through the process can only help you better understand it and realize what you need to work on to improve your status." [...] Charles said he would not go pro unless he was predicted to be chosen in the first round of the draft. [...] After the Holiday Bowl Charles said, [...] "Right now, I’m probably coming back. I didn’t think I did that good in the game. Next year maybe I’ll be up for the Heisman. I will come back." [...] From 2000–2007, the Longhorns have had sevenplayers taken in the first 10 picks of the NFL draft, more than any other school.|$|E

2500|$|The game began {{relatively}} low-scoring, {{with the}} Volunteers holding a 17–3 lead {{for the majority}} of the game. Tennessee leading rusher Cedric Houston missed the game with a torn ligament in his left thumb. Arkansas had injury problems of its own, and became one-dimensional with Cedric Cobbs, the Hogs' starting running back, missing much of the second half with a turf toe injury. The Razorbacks got the ball with ten minutes left in the fourth quarter and scored two touchdowns in a span of 4½ minutes. The tying touchdown was a 92-yard touchdown pass to Richard Smith from Matt Jones.
