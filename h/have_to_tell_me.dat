Confidence {{was the most important}} thing for any agent. However poor Inayat Khan 's jumping or even her encoding, Vera knew that those agents who did well were those who knew before they set off that they could do the job. Her intention was to let Inayat Khan feel that she had an opportunity to back out gracefully should she so wish. Vera began by asking if she was happy in what she was doing. Inayat Khan looked startled and said: [...] "Yes, of course." [...] Vera then told her about the letter and its contents. Inayat Khan was upset that anybody should think she was not fit for the job. [...] "You know that if you have any doubts, it is not too late to turn back," [...] Vera said. [...] "If you don't feel you're the typeâ€“if for any reason whatever you don't want to go p you only <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> now. I'll arrange everything so that you have no embarrassment. You will be transferred to another branch of the service with no adverse mark on your file. We have every respect for the man or woman who admits frankly to not feeling up to it." [...] She ended by adding: [...] "For us there is only one crime: to go out there and let your comrades down." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I willingly {{offer you}} all the time that I have at my own command," [...] Mercy replied. [...] "Does what you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> relate to Lady Janet?" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{paused a}} minute, and I saw {{that what he}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{was very hard to}} say.|$|R
6000|$|Sally winced. [...] "Yes" [...] she agreed, [...] "I {{guess you}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me.</b> He {{was fond of}} you. One could be proud of that. Harry Wyllard never did {{anything}} low down and mean." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{said nothing}} about ten minutes, Clary; and, after all, I haven't been an hour gone. Miss Spooner is in trouble about her tenant, who won't pay the rent, and she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> all about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] Tavernake decided, reluctantly. [...] "I don't {{know what}} there is you can <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> but I'll come as far as there, at any rate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} did,--because {{you are so}} soft. And now, Phineas, we will put it off no longer. Tell me all that you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> about him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I think Helen {{very much}} {{improved}} in appearance and manners,' said Sir Edward; 'and I am {{quite willing to}} believe all that I see you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> of her.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... [89] Yet I must somehow {{have laid}} {{hold of the}} pith of the matter, for, many years afterwards, when Dean Mansell's Bampton lectures were published, {{it seemed to me}} I already knew all that this eminently {{agnostic}} thinker <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|In my overpowering anxiety to {{hear what}} she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> I could not answer her--I could only put {{questions}} on my side. Laura's eagerness <b>to</b> know what <b>had</b> passed downstairs proved, however, too strong to be resisted. She persistently repeated her inquiries.|$|R
6000|$|... "I thank you, mademoiselle," [...] {{the countess}} said, as {{she led the}} girl to a couch. [...] "This is but a poor welcome that I am giving you; but I will make amends for it, when I have heard what Philip <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should be}} glad to hear {{anything}} you might <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> Mrs. Van Reinberg," [...] I said slowly; [...] "but you must please remember that I am an Englishman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You fellows will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{where to}} steer the sloop to," [...] said Larry, after the {{mainsail}} had been run up. [...] "I don't know where that old house is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am your friend," [...] he said slowly, [...] "whatever you may <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me.</b> You {{can trust}} me, Anna. You know that. I {{will be as}} silent as the grave." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [60] Yet I must somehow {{have laid}} {{hold of the}} pith of the [...] matter, for, many years afterwards, when Dean Mansel's [...] Bampton Lectures were published, {{it seemed to me}} I [...] already knew all that this eminently {{agnostic}} thinker [...] <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|I went {{on talking}} {{until at last}} the skipper asked me whether he was {{wandering}} in 'is mind, or whether I was. The mate came up from the cabin just then, and o' course he <b>'ad</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> there was somebody knocking at the gate.|$|R
60|$|Therese fetched another deep {{sigh and}} raising her eyes {{looked at me}} with great attention. I {{preserved}} an inscrutable expression, for I wanted to hear all she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> of Rita. I watched her with the greatest anxiety composing her face into a cheerful expression.|$|R
6000|$|... "Humph! {{you don't}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what to do," [...] growled the other cadet; and then, {{striking}} {{a bit of}} extra smooth roadway, the Yellow Streak bounded ahead, much {{to the delight of}} its riders.|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me.</b> I know. I knew it {{the moment}} you came in. There was {{something}} on your face, something I haven't seen there for a long, long time. It was an old look." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{is a cold}} greeting," [...] said Ralph, {{amazed and}} trembling, for he feared lest Suzanne should have changed her mind as to their marriage. [...] "What {{is it that you}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me?</b> Speak on, quickly." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Luker was, {{in every}} respect, such an {{inferior}} creature to the Indian--he was so vulgar, so ugly, so cringing, and so prosy--that {{he is quite}} unworthy of being reported, at any length, in these pages. The substance of what he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> may be fairly stated as follows: ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was mounted}} and was riding on, forgetful of Alderling, {{and what he}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> if he <b>had</b> anything, but he {{recalled}} me <b>to</b> myself by <b>having</b> apparently forgotten me, for when I paused, he took up his affair at a quite different point, and as though that were the question in hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do not be displeased," [...] I said, and as I spoke I seated myself {{beside her}} on the stone. She made no objections. I think she was too much {{agitated}} even to notice it. [...] "I had no intention of keeping anything from you, but I first wanted to hear what you <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me.</b> Sylvia did not <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> everything, nor have you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, my lad," [...] he said, [...] "and what is {{this great}} thing you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that is so mightily wonderful? I got what's-his-name--Mr. Jones's--letter, and now I am ready {{to hear what you}} have to say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will not}} be for long," [...] he went on. [...] "I am far too anxious {{to hear what you}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> to submit to any needless delays. The truth is, I have had a message from Lady Janet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, my lad," [...] he said; [...] "and what is {{this great}} thing you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that is so mightily wonderful? I got what's-his-name--Mr. Jones's-- letter, and now I am ready {{to hear what you}} have to say." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was he who}} <b>had</b> {{forgotten}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> this, and <b>to</b> me it was {{the most}} direful news of all.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{said that}} you <b>had</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> Tom," [...] remarked Sam, as the three were going downstairs to breakfast. [...] "What was it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Mary, {{the time}} <b>to</b> shake hands <b>has</b> not yet come; {{that you must}} know very well. You did not say in your letter what you <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> but only that you <b>had</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me; remembering what we parted in anger about, and knowing that you know how deeply I feel on that subject, I naturally concluded that you wished to see me about it. I {{do not wish to}} be trifled with." ...|$|R
6000|$|The girls {{picked him}} up and patted his straw {{stuffing}} into shape, and he continued, {{as if nothing had}} occurred: [...] "But you'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what to do, for I never have raised a sunken island in all my life." ...|$|E
6000|$|When they pressed me further, I said: [...] "I {{am really}} the questioner. I am visiting your country, and you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> things. It {{is not right}} that I should do all the telling. Tell me all about Romain Rolland." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that, Dick," [...] put in Tom Dillon. He {{turned to}} the others. [...] "It's all right, boys; just make yourselves at home. We'll get a good night's rest here, and follow Abe and the others fust thing in the mornin'." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{few days}} later I again heard Dawling on my stairs, and even before he passed my {{threshold}} I knew he <b>had</b> something <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|BRODIE. I {{thought you}} <b>had</b> come <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> something. Here I am. For God's sake out with it, and don't stand beating about the bush.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I've {{no doubt}} you <b>have</b> much <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> about your trip, and if you'll talk about Edinburgh and London, I won't let anybody in." ...|$|R
