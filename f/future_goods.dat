By way of contrast, {{and in the course}} of explaining his own pure time-preference, or [...] "capitalization," [...] theory of interest, Fetter showed that time valuation is prerequisite to the determination of the market rate of interest.|$|E

60|$|Since all {{capital is}} the product of saving, that is, of {{abstinence}} from present consumption {{for the sake of a}} <b>future</b> <b>good,</b> the increase of capital must depend upon two things—the amount of the fund from which saving can be made, and the strength of the dispositions which prompt to it.|$|R
50|$|Böhm-Bawerk cited {{three reasons}} for this {{difference}} in value. First of all, in a growing economy, the supply of goods will always be larger in the future {{than it is in}} the present. Secondly, people have a tendency to underestimate their future needs due to carelessness and shortsightedness. Finally, entrepreneurs would rather initiate production with goods presently available, instead of waiting for <b>future</b> <b>goods</b> and delaying production.|$|E

5000|$|The {{third rail}} was only used {{for access to}} the {{carriage}} works after the September 1964 closure of the Southport-Crossens service, which became a victim of the Beeching Axe (along with the WLR main line) despite being used by over 2 million passenger per year. This left the station with a much reduced service to Southport & Wigan, which initially was only provided at morning & evening peak periods. [...] From 14 June 1965, all trains on the Wigan route were routed through the station with the closure of the Blowick line, but it wasn't until the spring 1967 timetable change that off-peak calls were reinstated. The Wigan to Southport line had not been recommended for closure by Beeching in his 1963 report, but British Rail subsequently submitted a closure proposal for the route and Meols Cop station in May 1967. [...] This was eventually rejected by the Minister for Transport exactly a year later, securing the station's <b>future.</b> <b>Goods</b> traffic however ceased to be handled in November 1967, with the closure of the goods yard.|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates {{a general}} {{relationship}} between risk and time preferences. I consider a decision maker who chooses a one-time consumption. I assume however, {{that he believes}} both that today’s good is certain, and that, as the promised date for <b>future</b> <b>goods</b> becomes increasingly distant, the probability of his consuming the goods decreases continuously to zero. For example, the probability might be the subjective mortality rate of a decision maker or the objective hazard rate of <b>future</b> <b>goods.</b> Under the assumptions specified above, the present paper shows that (i) a decision maker exhibits the common ratio effect {{if and only if}} he discounts hyperbolically; (ii) he exhibits the certainty effect if and only if he discounts quasi-hyperbolically; and (iii) he exhibits the expected utility if and only if he is temporally unbiased (an exponential discounter) ...|$|E
40|$|When voters vote ethnically, {{as they do}} in many African countries, what is the reason? Do voters prefer coethnics {{because of}} ethnic pride? Or is {{ethnicity}} as a proxy for performance? I use a voting simulation experiment in Uganda to investigate the underlying rationale for ethnic voting. I find evidence that voters anticipate more <b>future</b> <b>goods</b> from a coethnic presidential candidate. Most strikingly, I find that coethnicity matters to voters only when the candidate has a record of prior goods provisions and, similarly, that record matters most when the candidate is coethnic. Furthermore, those types of voters who would be most likely to receive ethnic patronage are those {{who are most likely to}} vote ethnically. I confirm this finding by asking respondents to make predictions about the future performance of coethnic and non-coethnic candidates. I find that respondents expect more <b>future</b> <b>goods</b> from coethnics than from noncoethnic candidates. ...|$|E
