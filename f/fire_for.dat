5|$|After the Aleutian Islands Campaign, a refit was {{undertaken}} at the Puget Sound Navy Yard. On 25 October, New Mexico returned to Pearl Harbor to {{practice for the}} invasion of the Gilbert Islands. On 20 November, while the invasion was under way, she shelled Makin Atoll. During the fighting on the islands the ship was tasked with guarding transports at night when they retreated from the islands, providing anti-aircraft <b>fire</b> <b>for</b> the unloading of supplies and troops, and providing screening <b>fire</b> <b>for</b> the aircraft carriers. After U.S. troops captured the Gilbert Islands on 5 December, New Mexico returned to Pearl Harbor.|$|E
5|$|After the {{invasion}} of the Mariana Islands, she received an overhaul at Bremerton, Washington, from October to November. After the overhaul, she arrived in Leyte Gulf to escort reinforcement and supply transports and convoys. She dealt with daily air attacks, as the Japanese put up heavy resistance to the liberation of the Philippines. She departed Leyte Gulf on 2 December to the Palaus, where she later joined a Mindoro-bound convoy. She provided anti-aircraft <b>fire</b> <b>for</b> the convoy and provided cover <b>fire</b> <b>for</b> invading forces. She provided cover for two more days before retiring to the Palaus.|$|E

5|$|A {{supply of}} 929 M249 SAWs was issued to {{personnel}} from the U.S. Army and Marine Corps during the Persian Gulf War. Although exposure to combat was scarce, M249 gunners {{who were involved}} in fighting mainly used their weapons to provide cover <b>fire</b> <b>for</b> friendly maneuvering troops from fixed positions, rather than maneuvering with them. There were many complaints about the weapons clogging up with sand after prolonged use in the desert environment.|$|E
5|$|Amir's brigade was {{now down}} to one {{battalion}}, which was to attack with Nir's brigade of 50 tanks. To Amir's surprise, a reserve armored battalion of 25 tanks commanded by Colonel Eliashiv Shemshi arrived in the area, en route to Keren's brigade. Short of forces, Amir, with Adan's approval, commandeered Shemshi's battalion, and ordered him to provide covering <b>fire</b> <b>for</b> Nir's assault on the Firdan bridge.|$|E
5|$|Because of its higher {{susceptibility}} {{and lower}} reliance on <b>fire</b> <b>for</b> reproduction, the optimal fire interval for B.prionotes {{is higher than}} for other Banksia species with which it occurs. One simulation suggested an interval of 18 years was optimal for B.prionotes, compared to 15 years for B.hookeriana and 11 years for B.attenuata. The same model suggested that B.prionotes is quite susceptible to reductions in fire intervals. On the other hand, it shows little susceptibility to increases in fire interval: although senescence and death are often observed in plants older than about 30 years, healthy stands have been observed that have escaped <b>fire</b> <b>for</b> 50 years. These stands have a multi-aged structure, demonstrating the occurrence of successful inter-fire recruitment.|$|E
40|$|Under the High Pressure Earth Storable Rocket Technology (HIPES) Program, TRW {{successfully}} completed testing of two 100 lbf thrust class rhenium chambers using N 204 -MMH.

5|$|Confusion arose {{about the}} timeline. The {{cameraman}} said the shooting began at noon and continued for 45 minutes. Jamal's account matched his: he and Muhammad {{arrived at the}} junction around noon, and were under <b>fire</b> <b>for</b> 45 minutes.|$|E
5|$|His writing {{style is}} best {{described}} as equal parts anger, confidence, and pageantry. Scalia has a taste for garish analogies and offbeat allusions—often very funny ones—and he speaks in no uncertain terms. He is highly accessible and tries not to get bogged down in abstruse legal jargon. But most of all, Scalia's opinions read like they're about to catch <b>fire</b> <b>for</b> pure outrage. He does not, in short, write like a happy man.|$|E
5|$|Tactically, SAWs {{are either}} carried with a {{maneuvering}} unit and fired while handheld, or positioned to remain stationary and provide covering <b>fire</b> <b>for</b> other units. The usual load of ammunition carried for the weapon is 1,000 rounds in five 200-round belts, although up to 500 extra rounds generally get loaded into 100-round soft pouches.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of San Lorenzo {{was fought}} on February 3, 1813 in San Lorenzo, Argentina, then {{part of the}} United Provinces of the Río de la Plata. A Spanish Royalist force {{under the command of}} Antonio Zabala was {{defeated}} by the Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers, under the command of José de San Martín. This battle was the baptism of <b>fire</b> <b>for</b> this military unit, and for San Martín in the Spanish American wars of independence.|$|E
5|$|A lighter {{alternative}} to the turret, particularly popular with the French navy, was the barbette. These were fixed armored towers which held a gun on a turntable. The crew was sheltered from direct fire, but vulnerable to plunging <b>fire,</b> <b>for</b> instance from shore emplacements. The barbette was lighter than the turret, needing less machinery and no roof armor—though nevertheless some barbettes were stripped of their armor plate to reduce the top-weight of their ships. The barbette became widely adopted in the 1880s, and {{with the addition of}} an armored 'gun-house', transformed into the turrets of the pre-Dreadnought battleships.|$|E
5|$|At about 06:00 on 9 October 1913, , a Royal Line ship under {{charter to}} the Uranium Line, caught {{fire in a}} gale on the North Atlantic. The crew fought the <b>fire</b> <b>for</b> about two hours, but, realizing the {{severity}} of the fire and the limited options for dousing it in the high seas, Captain Francis Inch of Volturno had his wireless operator send out SOS signals. The westbound Kroonland, already beyond Volturnos location, turned east to aid the burning liner. In the meantime, several of Volturnos lifeboats with women and children aboard were launched with tragic results: all those aboard the lifeboats were killed as the boats capsized or were smashed by the hull of the heaving ship.|$|E

5|$|Banksia ericifolia {{depends on}} <b>fire</b> <b>for</b> regeneration; if fires are too infrequent, populations age and {{eventually}} die out. However, too-frequent fires also threaten this species, which takes around {{six years to}} reach maturity and flower. One study estimated an optimum fire interval of 15–30years. For {{a large part of}} its distribution Banksia ericifolia grows near areas of human habitation on Australia's eastern coastline. Bushland near urban areas is subject to both arson and prescribed burns, drastically reducing fire intervals and resulting in the disappearance of the species from some areas. The hotter a fire the more quickly seed is released; timing of rains afterwards is also critical for seedling survival.|$|E
5|$|Britain {{eventually}} {{extended its}} {{prosecution of the}} war into the Orange Free State and Transvaal Republic. On 21 August, at Van Wyk's Vlei, Sergeant Hampton and Corporal Knight held their positions and evacuated wounded mounted Kingsmen under heavy <b>fire,</b> <b>for</b> which they received the Victoria Cross. Two days later, Boer forces attacked the 1st Battalion while {{it was at the}} forefront of an advance south of Dalmanutha. The protracted engagement ended when the King's were ordered to withdraw, having almost expended their ammunition. Casualties exceeded 70, while Private Heaton earned the Victoria Cross.|$|E
5|$|During Part II of {{the series}} the concept of , {{altering}} the quality of chakra, is introduced. Nature manipulation allows ninja, following certain training, to convert their chakra into one of five elements: earth, water, fire, wind, and lightning. Each element is predominant and subordinate to different elements; for example, fire is weak against water, but can easily counter and even gain strength when used against a wind-based jutsu and earth is weak against lightning based jutsu. Most ninja have a natural affinity {{for one of the}} five elements, allowing them to use jutsu of that type with greater ease. Ninja with an affinity for <b>fire,</b> <b>for</b> instance, will be able to breathe fire much sooner than {{they will be able to}} manipulate water.|$|E

5|$|During the 1550s, Henry II became {{concerned}} about the threat of an English or Holy Roman Empire attack on Paris, and strengthened the defences of the Bastille in response. The southern gateway into the Bastille became the principal entrance to the castle in 1553, the other three gateways being closed. A bastion, a large earthwork projecting eastwards from the Bastille, was built to provide additional protective <b>fire</b> <b>for</b> the Bastille and the Arsenal; the bastion was reached from the fortress across a stone abutment using a connecting drawbridge that was installed in the Bastille's Comté tower. In 1573 the Porte Saint-Antoine was also altered – the drawbridges were replaced with a fixed bridge, and the medieval gatehouse was replaced with a triumphal arch.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} World War II, the Ma and Pa {{acquired}} four {{diesel locomotives}} for more economical operations, but traffic declined significantly. When the Ma and Pa's mail contract was cancelled by the U.S. postal service, the railroad discontinued all passenger service on August 31, 1954. One person on the last passenger train recalled that many riders came {{from as far away}} as Boston, Massachusetts, and Washington, D.C., to participate in the historic event, along with members of the National Railway Historical Society. The picturesque line's last steam engine dropped its <b>fire</b> <b>for</b> the final time on November 29, 1956.|$|E
5|$|Hannibal {{had been}} exposed to the {{combined}} French and Spanish <b>fire</b> <b>for</b> four hours, and had lost two masts and more than 140 men killed and wounded. In an effort to preserve the lives of his crew, Ferris ordered his men to shelter below decks, but at 14:00 fires broke out on the ship and Ferris, isolated by Saumarez's withdrawal, surrendered his ship. French boarding parties extinguished the fires and rehung the struck ensign upside down to signify that Hannibal had surrendered. However, in the Royal Navy an inverted flag is a signal of distress, and at least one British ship's boat was captured while attempting to bring assistance to Ferris before the misunderstanding was realised.|$|E
