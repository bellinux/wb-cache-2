40|$|The U. <b>S.</b> <b>wool</b> {{industry}} has long received lower prices for comparable wool types {{than those of}} Australia. In order to better understand such price differences, economic evaluations of both the U. <b>S.</b> and Australian <b>wool</b> markets were conducted. This research focused on two primary objectives. The first objective was to determine what price differences existed between the Australian and U. <b>S.</b> <b>wool</b> markets and measure that difference. The second objective was to calculate price differences attributable to wool characteristics, {{as well as those}} resulting from regional, seasonal, and yearly differences. In order to accomplish the objectives, the study was set up into three different hedonic pricing models: U. S., Australian, and combined. In the U. S. model, there were significant price differences in season, year, region, level of preparation, and wool description. In addition, average fiber diameter (AFD) had a negative nonlinear relationship with price and lot weight had a positive linear relationship with price. The Australian model was notably different than the U. S. model in that there were only three variables. The yearly variable follows the same general pattern as the U. S. data but with a smaller span of difference. The seasonal price differences were distinctly different than the U. S. because of the difference in seasonal patterns. In addition, the AFD had a similar negative nonlinear relationship with price. The final model combines both the U. S. data and the Australian data. The combined model had only three variables: season, year, AFD and country. As {{in the case of the}} previous two models, AFD had the same negative nonlinear relationship and similar price elasticity. Overall, there was a - 30. 5 percent discount for U. <b>S.</b> <b>wool</b> when compared to Australian wool. This can be attributed to several different factors. One of which is that the Australian wool {{industry has}} a more extensive marketing scheme when compared to the U. <b>S</b> <b>wool</b> market as a whole. However, this is only a beginning to future research that needs to be conducted. Continuing this study for future years, having more descriptive categories, and additional countries would further add explanation to wool prices...|$|R

In order to achieve the purpose of this research, the choice experiment was applied to examine consumers' preferences for wool attributes. Both mail and on-line surveys were conducted. The mail survey included three versions: basic version, version with definitions of attributes, and version with both definitions and information about wool attributes, with ## responses received (a 29 percent response rate). The on-line survey contained the basic version and the version with both definitions and information about wool attributes, with 514 responses received. Conditional logit and multinomial logit models were used to examine willingness-to-pay for wool attributes and consumer segments, respectively. Results indicated that a certain portion of U. <b>S.</b> consumers preferred <b>wool</b> over acrylic products. Findings also suggested that it is likely beneficial for wool producers to differentiate their products by promoting products' attributes, such as organic, animal-friendly, and environment-friendly.

40|$|International audienceFor {{chemistry}} networks {{describing the}} reactions {{for the early}} universe and especially for accurate models of the enrichment of deuterated molecules observed, {{we need to know}} in detail many state-to-state rate coefficients. For instance, Glover and Abel [1] modeled the chemistry of H 2 and HD primordial gas using a chemical network consisting of 115 reactions between 16 species. Today most of the rate coefficients of interesting reactions are still unknown or with a poor accuracy. For example, the uncertainty about the rate coefficient for the reaction D+ + H 2 [...] > HD + H+ directly affects model predictions for the HD abundance and thereby the cooling rate of the primordial gas. It is therefore of astrophysical importance to determine an accurate value of these rates, and helping to understand the cooling requires a complete set of the state-to-state rate coefficients as well as the total rate coefficient. We have thus studied the reaction with Time Independent Quantum Mechanical (TIQM) and Statistical Quantum Mechanical (SQM) methods and using the recent potential energy surface of Velilla et al. determined for H 3 + [2]. The state to state cross sections at low collisional energies and rate coefficients at low temperature have been computed and are compared to the available experimental data [3, 4]. The TIQM results are also compared with the SQM results for this low energy regime [5]. [1] <b>Glover</b> <b>S.</b> C. O., Abel T., Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc., 2008, 388, 1627.

40|$|Mitotic spindle {{orientation}} {{is essential to}} control cell-fate specification and epithelial architecture. The tumor suppressor Lgl localizes to the basolateral cortex of epithelial cells, where it acts together with Dlg and Scrib to organize apicobasal polarity. Dlg and Scrib also control planar spindle orientation, but how the organization of polarity complexes is adjusted to control symmetric division is largely unknown. Here, we show that the Dlg complex is remodeled during Drosophila follicular epithelium cell division, when Lgl is released to the cytoplasm. Lgl redistribution during epithelial mitosis is reminiscent of asymmetric cell division, where it is proposed that Aurora A promotes aPKC activation to control the localization of Lgl and cell-fate determinants. We show that Aurora A controls Lgl localization directly, triggering its cortical release at early prophase in both epithelial and S 2 cells. This relies on double phosphorylation within the putative aPKC phosphorylation site, which is required and sufficient for Lgl cortical release during mitosis and {{can be achieved by}} a combination of aPKC and Aurora A activities. Cortical retention of Lgl disrupts planar spindle orientation, but only when Lgl mutants that can bind Dlg are expressed. Hence, our work reveals that Lgl mitotic cortical release is not specifically linked to the asymmetric segregation of fate determinants, and we propose that Aurora A activation breaks the Dlg/Lgl interaction to allow planar spindle orientation during symmetric division via the Pins (LGN) /Dlg pathway.

40|$|The United States sheep {{industry}} has suffered an almost constant decline in sheep and lamb inventories; {{a record of}} 56 million head in the early 1940 s to only 5. 54 million head in 2011.

Six years later, in 2002, to enhance the demand for lamb, the Lamb Promotion, Research, and Information Order, better known as the American Lamb Checkoff Program, was established under the Commodity Promotion, Research and Information Act of 1996.

S. lamb and how much of the promotion benefit, if any, has been transmitted back through the supply chain to the different stakeholders of the lamb industry. This research investigated questions dealing with the demand, supply and trade of sheep and lamb through the global supply chain. This analysis used a seventy equation, non-spatial price equilibrium model to estimate the parameters of interest using the OLS method of estimation. After estimating the parameters, a simulation model was conducted over the sample period (1987 - 2011) as a means of validating the model. After validating the model using some within sample simulation statistics, the ?with? and ?without? lamb checkoff expenditure scenarios were developed to measure the effects and benefits of the program. The results of this study clearly indicated that not only did the lamb checkoff program increase the demand for lamb, the program tended to lift the entire supply chain in the process with every stakeholder group benefitting from it...|$|R
