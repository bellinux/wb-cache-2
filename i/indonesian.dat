40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore whether there is {{evidence}} of heat acclimatization in the words used to express thermal sensation. A total of 458 urban Japanese and 601 <b>Indonesians</b> participated in a questionnaire. In addition, in a preliminary survey, 39 native English speakers in the UK participated. Our results showed that (1) for <b>Indonesians,</b> the closest thermal descriptor of a feeling of thermal comfort was ???cool??? (75 %) followed by ???slightly cool??? (7 %), ???slightly cold??? (5 %) and ???cold??? (5 %), while Japanese responses were distributed uniformly among descriptors ???cool???, ???slightly cool???, ???neither???, ???slightly warm???, and ???warm???; (2) the closest thermal descriptors of a feeling of discomfort for <b>Indonesians</b> were less affected by individual thermal susceptibility (vulnerability) than those for Japanese; (3) in the cases where ???cool??? and ???slightly cold??? were imagined in the mind, the descriptors were cognized as a thermal comfortable feeling by 97 % and 57 % of <b>Indonesians,</b> respectively; (4) the most frequently voted choice endorsing hot weather was ???higher than 32 ??C??? for <b>Indonesians</b> and ???higher than 29 ??C??? for Japanese respondents; for cold weather, ???lower than 15 ??C??? for Japanese and ???lower than 20 ??C??? for <b>Indonesians.</b> In summary, the descriptor ???cool??? in <b>Indonesians</b> connotes a thermally comfortable feeling, but the inter-zone between hot and cold weather that was judged in the mind showed a upward shift when compared to that of Japanese.

5|$|After the {{formation}} of the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, Johor Bahru continued as the state capital and more development was carried out, with the town's expansion and the construction of more new townships and industrial estates. The <b>Indonesian</b> confrontation did not directly affect Johor Bahru as the main <b>Indonesian</b> landing point in Johor was in Labis. There is only one active <b>Indonesian</b> spy organisation in the town, known as Gerakan Ekonomi Melayu Indonesia (GEMI). They frequently engaged with the <b>Indonesian</b> communities living there to contribute information for <b>Indonesian</b> commandos until the bombing of the MacDonald House in Singapore in 1965. By the early 1990s, the town had considerably expanded in size, and was officially granted a city status on 1 January 1994. Johor Bahru City Council was formed and the city's current main square, Dataran Bandaraya Johor Bahru, was constructed to commemorate the event. A central business district was developed in the centre of the city from the mid-1990s in the area around Wong Ah Fook Street. The state and federal government channelled considerable funds {{for the development of the}} city—particularly more so after 2006, when the Iskandar Malaysia was formed.|$|E

40|$|Periodontitis may exert an {{infectious}} and inflammatory burden, evidenced by increased C-reactive protein (CRP). This burden may impair blood glucose control (HbA 1 c). The aim {{of our study}} was to analyze whether periodontitis severity as measured with the periodontal inflamed surface area (PISA) and CRP predict HbA 1 c levels {{in a group of}} healthy <b>Indonesians</b> and a group of <b>Indonesians</b> treated for type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM 2). A full-mouth periodontal examination, including probing pocket depth, gingival recession, clinical attachment loss, plaque index and bleeding on probing, was performed in 132 healthy <b>Indonesians</b> and 101 <b>Indonesians</b> treated for DM 2. Using these data, PISA was calculated. In addition, HbA 1 c and CRP were analyzed. A validated questionnaire was used to assess smoking, body mass index (BMI), education and medical conditions. In regression analyses, it was assessed whether periodontitis severity and CRP predict HbA 1 c, controlling for confounding and effect modification (i. e., age, sex, BMI, pack years, and education). In healthy <b>Indonesians,</b> PISA and CRP predicted HbA 1 c as did age, sex, and smoking. In <b>Indonesians</b> treated for DM 2, PISA did not predict HbA 1 c. Periodontitis may impair blood glucose regulation in healthy <b>Indonesians</b> in conjunction with elevated CRP levels. The potential effect of periodontitis on glucose control in DM 2 patients may be masked by DM 2 treatment. Clinical relevance: periodontitis may impair blood glucose control through exerting an inflammatory and infectious burden evidenced by increased levels of CRP...|$|R
