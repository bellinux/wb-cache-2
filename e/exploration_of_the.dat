5|$|Although {{no longer}} {{employed}} by the New Zealand Company, Heaphy, emboldened {{by the success of}} his report and the public reception to his paintings, sought further opportunities for similar work. From London, he wrote to the company secretary seeking support for <b>exploration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area inland of Nelson. The response was unenthusiastic, the company was concentrating on developing its settlements, rather than undertaking in further <b>exploration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country. Despite this, Heaphy returned to New Zealand and arrived in Nelson on 22 December 1842.|$|E

5|$|A midget or fleet {{submarine}} attack. Extensive searches {{immediately following}} the sinking had failed to detect any enemy submarine, and the Allies had made no attempt at claiming the enormous propaganda value of sinking a capital ship in her home anchorage; consequently, this possibility was quickly discounted.

5|$|American <b>exploration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area {{began in}} 1851, when {{prospector}} Samuel Hancock {{was led by}} Indian guides on a canoe up the Stillaguamish River. The area was opened to logging after {{the signing of the}} Treaty of Point Elliott in 1855 between the United States government and the Stillaguamish tribe, who were relocated to trust lands and the Tulalip Indian Reservation. The U.S. Army built a military road connecting Fort Steilacoom to Fort Bellingham, crossing the Stillaguamish River near the confluence.|$|E
5|$|Callisto is {{surrounded}} by an extremely thin atmosphere composed {{of carbon dioxide and}} probably molecular oxygen. Investigation revealed that Callisto may possibly have a subsurface ocean of liquid water at depths less than 300 kilometres. The likely presence of an ocean within Callisto indicates that it can or could harbour life. However, this is less likely than on nearby Europa. Callisto has long been considered the most suitable place for a human base for future <b>exploration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jupiter system since it is furthest from the intense radiation of Jupiter.|$|E

5|$|In 1494, the {{principal}} maritime powers, Portugal and Spain, signed a treaty which drew a line {{down the middle}} of the Atlantic Ocean and allocated all trade routes to the east of the line to Portugal. That gave Portugal dominance of the only known route to the east—via the Cape of Good Hope and Indian Ocean, which left Spain, and later other countries, to seek a western route to the Pacific. The <b>exploration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> south began as part of the search for such a route.|$|E
5|$|It {{could be}} {{possible}} to build a surface base that would produce fuel for further <b>exploration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Solar System.
