5|$|Hong Kong's current legal system, {{independent}} {{of the legal system}} of mainland China and Chinese civil law, inherits from British Common Law established before 1997.

40|$|The role of <b>judicial</b> <b>systems</b> in {{determining}} economic perfonnance has gained increasingly attention in recent years. Nonetheless, the literature lacks a clearly articulated framework {{to examine how}} <b>judicial</b> <b>systems</b> influence the investment and production decisions of economic agents. This paper tries to till in this gap. It examines what constitutes a well-functioning judiciary, analyzes how dysfunctional <b>judicial</b> <b>systems</b> compromise economic growth, and reviews the relevant empirical literature. It concludes with some remarks about why, despite the widespread perception that well-functioning legal and <b>judicial</b> <b>systems</b> are key {{to the success of}} market-oriented reforms in developing and transition countries, judicial refonn has lagged so much behind other reforms...|$|R

5|$|Since 1971, the {{government}} has functioned under the seventh Constitution of Virginia, which provides for a strong legislature and a unified <b>judicial</b> <b>system.</b> Similar to the federal structure, {{the government}} is divided in three branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. The legislature is the General Assembly, a bicameral body whose 100-member House of Delegates and 40-member Senate write the laws for the Commonwealth. The Assembly is stronger than the executive, as it selects judges and justices. The Governor and Lieutenant Governor are elected every four years in separate elections. Incumbent governors cannot run for re-election, however the Lieutenant Governor and Attorney General can, and governors may serve non-consecutive terms. The <b>judicial</b> <b>system,</b> the oldest in America, consists of a hierarchy from the Supreme Court of Virginia and the Court of Appeals of Virginia to the Circuit Courts, the trial courts of general jurisdiction, and the lower General District Courts and Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Courts.|$|E
5|$|The Indian {{government}} has {{taken steps to}} alleviate some of the current gender inequalities. In 1992, the government of India established the National Commission for Women. The Commission was meant to address many of the inequalities women face, specifically rape, family and guardianship. However, {{the slow pace of}} change in the <b>judicial</b> <b>system</b> and the aforementioned cultural norms have prevented the full adoption of policies meant to promote equality between men and women.|$|E

However, there is a political will to fight against corruption in the government, {{and the government has}} made some progress in combating corruption, such as minimizing tax regulations in order to improve transparency in the tax office.|$|E

The Tamil Tigers also established and implemented a <b>Judicial</b> <b>system</b> which consisted of district courts, high courts and supreme court {{as well as a}} court of appeal.

He was awarded a Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany and was given a plaque of honour by the city of Frankfurt in 1970. He died there on 14 September 1983.|$|E

5|$|All of the Irish kingdoms {{had their}} own kings but were {{nominally}} subject to the High King.

The concept didn't become a political reality until the Viking Age and even then was not a consistent one. Ireland did have a culturally unifying rule of law: the early written <b>judicial</b> <b>system,</b> the Brehon Laws, administered by a professional class of jurists known as the brehons.|$|E
5|$|As {{time went}} on, Louis XVIII {{realised}} that France would never accept {{an attempt to}} return to the Ancien Régime. Accordingly, he created another policy in 1805 with a view toward reclaiming his throne: a declaration that was far more liberal than his former ones. It repudiated his Declaration of Verona, promised to abolish conscription, retain Napoleon I's administrative and <b>judicial</b> <b>system,</b> reduce taxes, eliminate political prisons, and guarantee amnesty to everyone who did not oppose a Bourbon Restoration. The opinions expressed in the declaration were largely those of the Count of Avaray, Louis's closest associate in exile.|$|E
5|$|At present, Romania {{is divided}} into 41 {{counties}} and one municipality (Bucharest); these are assigned as the NUTS-3 geocode statistical subdivision scheme of Romania within the European Union. Each of the counties is further divided into cities (some of which have municipality status) and communes. The prefect and his administration have executive prerogatives within the county limits, while limited legislative powers are assigned to a County Council elected every four years during local elections. The territorial districts of the Romanian <b>judicial</b> <b>system</b> overlap with county borders, thus avoiding further complication in {{the separation of powers}} on the government.|$|E

5|$|At {{the local}} level, the island's 22 provinces are {{administered}} by a governor and provincial council. Provinces are further sub-divided into regions and communes. The judiciary is {{modeled on the}} French system, with a High Constitutional Court, High Court of Justice, Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, criminal tribunals, and tribunals of first instance. The courts, which adhere to civil law, lack the capacity to quickly and transparently try the cases in the <b>judicial</b> <b>system,</b> often forcing defendants to pass lengthy pretrial detentions in unsanitary and overcrowded prisons.|$|E
5|$|Most of the <b>judicial</b> <b>system</b> {{and legal}} codes of the Weimar Republic {{remained}} in use {{during and after}} the Nazi era to deal with non-political crimes. The courts issued and carried out far more death sentences than before the Nazis took power. People who were convicted of three or more offences—even petty ones—could be deemed habitual offenders and jailed indefinitely. People such as prostitutes and pickpockets were judged to be inherently criminal and a threat to the racial community. Thousands were arrested and confined indefinitely without trial.|$|E
5|$|Some second-tier {{defendants}} {{were unable to}} post bail because the government refused to permit the Civil Rights Congress (CRC) legal defense fund to provide bail funding. The CRC had run afoul of the <b>judicial</b> <b>system</b> because it had posted bail for the 1949 trial defendants, and four of those defendants skipped bail in 1951. Leaders of the CRC were called {{before a grand jury}} and asked to identify the donors who had contributed money to the bail fund. Novelist Dashiell Hammett, a manager of the CRC fund, invoked the Fifth Amendment, refused to identify donors, and was sentenced to six months in prison.|$|E
