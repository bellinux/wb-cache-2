5|$|Even {{though to}} me, a Japanese schoolgirl uniform is <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> blackface, I am just in {{acceptance}} over it, because something {{is better than}} nothing. An ugly picture {{is better than a}} blank space, and it means that one day, we will have another display at the Museum of Asian Invisibility, that groups of children will crowd around in disbelief, because once upon a time, we weren’t there.|$|E
5|$|I {{wanted it}} to be almost like a photo album, so every single scene is <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> a picture that you're kind of looking into our relationship. So it is a 1920s vibe, it's black and white, very high fashion—you know, you'll see me very dapper in 1920s, Frank Sinatra-ish. So you'll see the cars from that era, you'll {{definitely}} feel the vibe of the house having that 1920s vibe as well. So it's very different and very intimate, and it's not a lot of dancing—it's more personal.|$|E
5|$|This one I had {{the most}} amount of input. I oversaw everything—the {{building}} of the sets, everyone's costumes, I had meetings with make-up and hair and the cinematographer, everybody. Casting, finding the right cat—just every aspect. <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> making a little movie. We basically sat down and just threw out all every idea we could possibly conceive of {{and of all the}} things we wanted. All the imagery we wanted—and I had a few set ideas, for instance the cat and the idea of Metropolis. I definitely wanted to have that influence, that look on all the men—the workers, diligently, methodically working away.|$|E

5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough {{of this kind of}} shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E
25|$|I invited Joss Whedon {{to lunch}} after I did the {{business}} deal with Fox. We'd had a cool {{relationship in the}} past and I so wanted to do something else, and I wanted to get back into a television show. I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> brother and sister and <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I {{was a little bit of}} a wild child. He's watched me and helped me and taught me over the years. I told him how bad I wanted and needed him back and he accepted and here we are.|$|E
25|$|The logo for {{the company}} showed Fun Ho! in a script like form within an oval that {{included}} an odd portrait of a clown-like face that looks <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> a laughing child with a beanie cap...or...a yelling oriental martial arts specialist. The riddle is solved when looking at a company catalog (leaflet) that zooms out showing a clown complete with ruffles and a tall pointed hat and carrying a Fun Ho! sign (Jordan 2015). The clown was most often printed in red, and was even used for company Christmas cards {{once upon a time}} (Jordan 2015). The logo was probably OK from the 1930s through the 1960s, but as an advertising gimmick, the design would probably would not work well with children today.|$|E

25|$|The {{whole notion}} of {{politics}} is they always present you with this or this or this. I'll get a newspaper to read between the lines. Why {{do you have to}} adhere to prescribed formulas that they have and people argue over them and they're all in a box. And you watch Fox claw CNN, and CNN claw Fox. Sometimes I catch a piece of the news and it seems insanity to me. I quietly support candidates. I'm not out there banging a drum for candidates. But I have supported a candidate and it's a whole other world. Once you've been exposed to it, once or twice or however many times, if you know the facts and see how they're presented, it's mind-boggling. It's a very scary arena to be in, but I do vote. I go in there and pull the lever. It's <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> pulling the lever and watching the trap door fall out from beneath you. Why should we trust any of these people? None of them ever deliver on anything. It's always disappointing.|$|E
