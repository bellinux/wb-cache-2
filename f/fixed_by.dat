5|$|Between 23 and 27 September 1830, heavy {{fighting}} {{took place between}} Dutch forces and Brussels revolutionaries, who were reinforced by small contingents from across the country.

Dutch garrisons were pushed out of the area, until only Antwerp and Luxembourg remained occupied. The Provisional Government of Belgium, led by Charles Rogier, was formed on 24 September and Belgian independence was officially proclaimed on 4 October while work began on creating a constitution. In December, international governments at the Conference of London recognized the independence of Belgium and guaranteed its neutrality. The Dutch, however, only recognized Belgium's independence and the terms of the Conference in 1839 and the Dutch-Belgian frontier was only <b>fixed</b> <b>by</b> the 1843 Treaty of Maastricht.|$|E
5|$|In March 1989, {{the first}} buses {{were tested in}} the tunnel; University Street station was only 75 percent complete, and buses had to drive under {{scaffolding}} and construction equipment while passing through the station. Tunnel construction was completed in June 1990, and a soft opening for University Street station was held on August 9, 1990. Bus service in the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel began on September 15, 1990, with several Metro bus routes moved into the tunnel from surface streets. All service on routes using the tunnel was operated by dual-mode buses, which operated as diesel buses outside the tunnel and electrically, as trolleybuses, when inside the tunnel. During its early months, University Street and other stations were affected by serious water leaks, which splashed water onto walkways during the tunnel's first winter in operation. The leaks were later <b>fixed</b> <b>by</b> Metro contractors.|$|E
5|$|In {{a master}} plan from 2006, Avinor has {{identified}} several key development issues to increase {{the capacity of the}} airport. For Terminal A, the plans call to keep the existing structure, and gradually expand it westwards, eventually passing over the railway on a culvert. Along the area between the railway and the highway, a south pier is planned to be constructed, with the inside facing immediately towards the railway and the outside having aircraft stands. In the short term, this is planned with six stands for regional aircraft, with a single-story building. The remaining stands currently used for regional aircraft will then be converted to international gates. While Avinor states that there is need for an expansion of Terminal B, no concrete solution has been found, {{in part because of the}} lack of space in the area, although this can partially be <b>fixed</b> <b>by</b> removing the general aviation from the area.|$|E

Some encountered other problems such as crashing with a blue screen and then restarting, the power button making a rattling noise when the phone was shaken, overheating, the microphone not working, and Touch ID not working for iTunes purchases.
