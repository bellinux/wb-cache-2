25|$|I was {{lobbying}} at the Council of Europe and at Parliament; I {{was over}} in Washington, in Jo'burg, in South America. It was 'let's get guns for the Contras', that sort of stuff. I was enjoying it immensely, I got to go with these guys and fire off AK-47s. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> go where the action is, and for that period in the Reagan/Thatcher days, it was great fun, it was all expenses paid and I {{got to see the}} world. I used to think that World Briefing was a bit funny. The only scary thing about those publications was the mailing listpeople like George Bushand the fact that Hart would talk to the head of British Intelligence for an hour. I used to think it was us having a laugh, putting some loony right-wing sell in, and that somebody somewhere was taking it seriously. You've got to understand that we had a sense of humour about this.|$|E
500|$|In an 18 August 2006 Science Friday interview, Mike Brown {{expressed}} {{doubt that}} a scientific definition was even necessary. He stated, [...] "The analogy that <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> use {{is the word}} [...] "continent". You know, the word [...] "continent" [...] has no scientific definition ... they're just cultural definitions, and I think the geologists are wise to leave that one alone and not try to redefine things so that the word [...] "continent" [...] has a big, strict definition." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the second}} verse, Ross' lyrics are {{somewhat}} different, [...] "Red bottom Bawse house big as Baltimore" [...] and [...] "With a blonde bombshell trying {{to bond with}} your boy." [...] Additionally, he makes reference to strippers, as well as driving with a suspended drivers' license. Throughout the bridge, Carey sings about achieving despite surrounding odds: [...] "In spite of the chains that bind you/ You can see the mountain top/ It’s not too far." [...] Additionally, towards the last chorus, the singer releases a series of her [...] "signature" [...] high notes. During an August 2, conference call, Carey described how she felt working with the duo, and how she felt Ross' voice blended well with her own: [...] "Working with Ross and Meek on the same record was incredible. Obviously Ross is a star and everybody loves him. I'm a fan of his music," [...] said Carey on the collaboration. [...] "I really, really {{wanted to work with}} him. I love the tone of his voice. I think the contrast of his voice and mine would be something special. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> do collaborations that people might think are different." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{he told me}} {{the story}} once, and <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> hear it, because it was {{pleasant}} to see how well he had succeeded." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{half an hour}} I kept banterin' {{her like}} that, and though she got pink now and then, she didn't seem to understand--or if she did she didn't let on. She stuck to her work whilst {{the old man and}} me watched her. Seein' her going about that kitchen that way got me locoed. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> watch mother in the kitchen--and Nance was a genuine housekeeper, <b>I</b> <b>always</b> knew that.|$|R
6000|$|... 'So {{much the}} better,' growled Dennis--it was that amiable gentleman. 'She's quiet. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>like</b> 'em <b>to</b> faint, unless they're very tender and composed.' ...|$|R
500|$|Jude Law {{stars as}} Joseph [...] "Joe" [...] Sullivan, a.k.a. Sky Captain: He {{commands}} a private air force {{known as the}} Flying Legion. His personal aircraft is a modified Curtiss P-40. In 2002, producer Jon Avnet showed Law the teaser trailer and the actor was very impressed by what he saw. He remembers, [...] "All I got at that early stage was that he'd used pretty advanced and unused technology to create a very retrospective look." [...] Avnet gave him the script to read and some preliminary artwork to look at. Law: [...] "What was clear was also that at the center was a really great cinematic relationship, which you could put into any genre and it would work. You know, the kind of bickering [...] <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> call it The African Queen meets Buck Rogers." [...] Avnet {{wanted to work with}} Law because he knew that the actor had [...] "worked both period, who worked both having theatrical experience, who worked on blue screen, who hadn't hit yet as a major action star." [...] The actor had just finished filming Cold Mountain (2003) and was intrigued at going from filming on real locations to working on a movie done completely on a soundstage. [...] Sky Captain would be one of three Jude Law films released by Paramount Pictures in 2004, along with the remake of Alfie (2004) and [...] Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events (2004). It also was one of six overall Jude Law films released that year.|$|E
500|$|A {{focus of}} Tang's {{art is the}} theme of {{national}} and cultural identities, I Was Born Japanese (1995) being an example. Tang notes that he has had four nationalities. He was issued with a Japanese birth certificate as he was born during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore. He became a British national after World War II, a Malaysian citizen when Singapore joined the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, and a Singaporean citizen when Singapore gained full independence in 1965. While living in the UK he was conscious of his Chinese identity, but later on he took the view that he might not be fully Chinese since China had been occupied by the Mongols and Manchurians: [...] "I'm not sure if I'm 100% Chinese blood. I'm sure my ancestor has got mixture of Mongolian and even Thai and Miao people [...] We are all mixed, and this is true. But <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> think {{that there is only one}} race in the world. We are all one human race." [...] Another of Tang's performances, Jantung Pisang – Heart of a Tree, Heart of a People, centres around the banana tree. He was inspired by the fact that the banana is used widely in Southeast Asia as an offering to bring blessings, but is also feared as it is associated with ghosts and spirits. He also sees banana trees as a reminder of the lack of democracy in certain parts of the world: [...] "Democracy in many Asian countries and Third World countries is as shallow as the roots of a banana tree. We need to deepen [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|Maggie {{debuted in}} 2002. Hendrickson, at first, had a {{difficult}} time differentiating her from Frankie. [...] "Oh, my gosh, I was so afraid about that," [...] she said. [...] "I was trying to go for something completely different, but the problem was that the writers left it so ambiguous; the character was such a blank slate. I just decided to make her lighter, prettier [...] I kept the humor; <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> play a little bit of humor. And I was playing her straight [...] at first ! So I went for heterosexual, pretty, funny. And smarter!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, that's simple enough. I {{understand}} exactly what you mean. Well, if ever it becomes less difficult, remember that <b>I</b> should <b>always</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> know. It seemed a little--personal." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{was working}} as a {{waitress}} in a Loop restaurant for about a month. I never worked in a dance hall like this and didn't know about them. One day the [...] "boss" [...] of this hall was eating in the restaurant and told me I could make twice as much money in his [...] "dancing school." [...] I went there one night to try it - and then quit my job at the restaurant. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> dance anyway, so it was really fun." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{publishing}} {{of books}} {{is a very}} different affair now-a-days from what it was in the time of Bernard Lintot. I found the publisher a fashionably-dressed man, in an elegant drawing-room, furnished with sofas and portraits of celebrated authors, and cases of splendidly bound books. He was writing letters at an elegant table. This was transacting business in style. The place seemed suited to the magnificent publications that issued from it. I rejoiced at the choice I had made of a publisher, for <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> encourage men of taste and spirit.|$|R
6000|$|... "I thank you, mistress," [...] said Tyrrel; [...] "but I {{have some}} {{drawings}} and colours in these saddle-bags, and <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> carry them myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you didn't {{sound like}} Ohio. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> make sure. Well, you must pull up. Mother, {{have you got}} {{anything}} fit to eat, this evening?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, yes, Mrs. Rowan. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> hear {{of young}} men getting married; that is when they've got {{anything}} to live upon. It makes them less harum-scarum like." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Another {{thing is}} that I never liked {{fighting}} in the cage. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> fight in the ring. The second {{thing is that}} I liked fighting in Japan. Japan is like my second home—I feel like I'm home in Japan. All those reasons brought me here, and I'm very happy that I'm going to fight here in Japan. But of course, one day, I don't know when, but definitely I'll {{be back in the}} UFC to show that it was just a bad period for me. Now I'm fully recovered, physically and mentally, most important mentally." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{we climbed}} to the top of the ridge, and in {{scouting}} around along the heavily timbered edges we came to a ravine deep enough to be classed as a canyon. Here the forest was dark and still, with sunlight showing down in rays and gleams. While hunting <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> sit down here and there to listen and watch. Copple liked this too. So we sat down. Opposite us the rocky edge of the other slope was about two hundred yards. We listened to jays and squirrels. I made note of the significant fact that as soon as we began to hunt Copple became silent.|$|R
60|$|Apuleius is florid, which {{favored the}} poetical design on his sentences. Indeed {{he is more}} florid than <b>I</b> have <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> make my verses. It is not, of course, an {{absolute}} translation, but as a running commentary on the text it is sufficiently faithful.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh! I {{am glad to}} know that, because <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be put {{right when}} I am wrong,' said Rosa Dartle. 'You mean {{it is a little}} dry, perhaps?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Southward," [...] she answered. [...] "The {{other side}} of the Channel. That, at least, is something. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> feel that there is sea between me and a place which I--loathe!" ...|$|E
6000|$|No {{one took}} up the {{question}} again, and it was Kenby who spoke next. [...] "The doctor thinks, if this weather holds, that we shall be into Plymouth Wednesday morning. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> get a professional opinion on the ship's run." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suddenly}} became very {{much interested in}} Miss Temple. 'Tell me why you do that,' <b>I</b> said. 'I <b>always</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> know why people laugh at other people.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let Ben come in {{back here}} with me," [...] said Laura, [...] "and {{that will give}} Jessie a chance to sit in front. <b>I</b> know she <b>always</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> be up ahead," [...] and Laura smiled knowingly.|$|R
60|$|And also I applaud, dearest Howard, your {{expression}} of attachment to him who holds this pen (and passes {{it at this}} moment over very dirty paper:) for he is extremely accessible to such demonstrations and touched by them--more than ever in his lonely (more than) maturity. Keep it up as hard as possible; continue to pass your hand into my arm and believe that <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>like</b> greatly <b>to</b> feel it. We are two who can communicate freely.|$|R
6000|$|... "O, yes," [...] said Oliver, [...] "let {{us have a}} name. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have a name. There's the old 'General,'--we {{have had}} many {{a good time with}} him; and my 'Conqueror,'--there isn't a boy in town that doesn't know my sled." ...|$|E
6000|$|... '"Not I, sir! It {{only came}} into my head a moment ago, and <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be second to you in church matters. You could have knocked me down with a sparrer's feather when I thought o't, sir; I assure 'ee you could!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see, {{they weigh}} so little," [...] {{he said to}} me innocently, when I {{expressed}} my astonishment at the fact; [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> turn out like a gentleman." [...] Ah! if he could have foreseen the future and the raiment prepared for him.|$|E
40|$|When I {{would play}} pretend as a kid, <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> {{have some sort}} of {{structure}} to play on. Whether it was the jungle gym at school, a fort I had built with my brother, or the local Chuck E. Cheese, I had the most fun, and my imagination was the most free when there were more tubes to slide in or trampolines to jump on. Over the past three years at U. C. San Diego I feel like I have built my actor playground. I have gained a structure that has allowed me to freely play wherever I need to go; to the back woods of Wisconsin, to the east river slums of New York, to lavish palaces in Egypt, to heaven and back. During my time at school I have picked and pieced different tools together so I can be free and confident with each new part that comes my way to play. I now feel that I have built a playground that suits me perfectly, where I can set my mind and body free to create anything imaginable...|$|R
5000|$|Musically, Maynard {{has made}} his career out of [...] "guilty pleasures" [...] - songs that are not fashionable, but are {{nevertheless}} loved by many people in secret. He described in an interview how this was a reaction against his primary source of fame: [...] "Being breakfast announcer on Triple J automatically means {{you are one of}} the coolest people in the country … but I was never comfortable with that and <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> celebrate retro culture." [...] He often uses the word [...] "dag", an old-fashioned Australian slang word for [...] "somebody who is happily unfashionable". His shows bring these into the open: [...] "it's like dag group therapy. Once everyone gets together and admits it, they don't feel as guilty. The pleasure gets greater and the guilt gets less." [...] Similarly, he goes out of his way to defy fashion in his dress sense: loud Hawaiian shirts are one of his signature items, and he is proud to make the [...] "worst dressed" [...] list on a society page.|$|R
6000|$|... "A heavy south-easter would jam us in, here, {{between the}} shoals, {{in a way}} I shouldn't greatly relish, sir. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>always</b> <b>to</b> get to the eastward of the Stream, as soon as I can, in running off the land." ...|$|R
6000|$|Bobby {{shook his}} head. [...] "No," [...] said he, [...] "not unless {{you mean the}} habit I have of washing my food. If there is any water near, <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> take what I am going to eat over to it and wash it; somehow it tastes better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I love it, too," [...] she murmured, with an {{answering}} flash of the eyes. [...] "I am not sure," [...] she went on, [...] "that I care about these large parties, although <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> come when Sir Frederick asks me. He {{is such a}} dear, isn't he?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well {{then there}} we are! Only"--and Miss Barrace appealed again to Strether--"don't let it {{discourage}} you. You'll break down soon enough, but you'll meanwhile have had your moments. Il faut en avoir. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> see {{you while you}} last. And I'll tell you who WILL last." ...|$|E
5000|$|The album can be {{listened to}} as 16 {{different}} movements or two lengthy tracks. Part I, [...] "Tao of the Dead," [...] is split into eleven tracks, whereas Part II, [...] "Strange News From Another Planet," [...] is five songs combined into one. Conrad Keely, {{in an interview}} with Spin.com, described the album's composition. [...] "It's the way I listened to albums when I was a kid, seeing as some of my favorite records were Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, Yes's Relayer and Close <b>to</b> the Edge... <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> listening <b>to</b> records that were just a continuous piece, like an orchestra or a symphony." ...|$|R
60|$|September 4th.--I made {{a voyage}} in the Pond-Lily {{all by myself}} {{yesterday}} morning, and was much encouraged by my success in causing the boat to go whither I would. <b>I</b> have <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> be afloat, but I think I have never adequately conceived of the enjoyment till now, when I begin to feel a power over that which supports me. I suppose I must have felt something like this sense of triumph when I first learned to swim; but I have forgotten it. O that I could run wild!--that is, that I could put myself into a true relation with Nature, and be on friendly terms with all congenial elements.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are to me. Because <b>I</b> would <b>like</b> <b>always</b> <b>to</b> be {{sure that}} I had pleased you, {{and for the last}} twelve hours I've only been able to make sure that I hadn't. That's the {{consolation}} I'm going away with. I thought I'd get you to confirm my impression explicitly. That's why I wished to join you." ...|$|R
