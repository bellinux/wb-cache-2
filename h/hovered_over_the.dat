25|$|A video {{recording}} {{made by a}} UNIFIL soldier of Force Mobile Reserve (FMR) showed an unmanned drone and two helicopters in the vicinity {{at the time of}} the shelling. An Israeli government spokesman confirmed there was a drone in the area, but stated that it did not detect civilians in the compound. The IDF initially and repeatedly claimed, in response to the UN investigator, Dutch major-general Frank van Kappen's questioning, that no drone was flying in the area before or during the shelling. All eyewitnesses testified that during the attack a pilotless drone <b>hovered</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> camp. The truth only emerged when the UNIFIL soldier secretly delivered the tape to Beirut-based journalist Robert Fisk. Fisk sent the video to his newspaper, The Independent, which published stills of the footage in an article that appeared on May 6.|$|E
500|$|The eponymous {{character}} Winnie Winkle was a young, unmarried {{woman who}} had to support her parents, making it the second popular comic strip about working women (after Somebody's Stenog, which debuted in 1918). It was {{a reflection of the}} new role of women in society, as could also be seen in comics such as Tillie the Toiler from 1921. Writing for the Associated Press in 1993, Hugh A. Mulligan noted, [...] "After women got the vote and joined the work force, family-centered comics were joined by working-girl strips like Winnie Winkle, Tillie the Toiler, Dixie Dugan, Somebody's Stenog and Brenda Starr, which was drawn by a woman, Dale Messick.

500|$|Anne Boleyn was {{beheaded}} in 1536 for treason against Henry VIII; her ghost supposedly haunts {{the chapel}} of St Peter ad Vincula, {{where she is}} buried, and has been said {{to walk around the}} White Tower carrying her head under her arm. This haunting is commemorated in the 1934 comic song [...] "With Her Head Tucked Underneath Her Arm". Other reported ghosts include Henry VI, Lady Jane Grey, Margaret Pole, and the Princes in the Tower. In January 1816, a sentry on guard outside the Jewel House claimed to have witnessed an apparition of a bear advancing towards him, and reportedly died of fright a few days later. In October 1817, a tubular, glowing apparition was claimed to have been seen in the Jewel House by the Keeper of the Crown Jewels, Edmund Lenthal Swifte. He said that the apparition <b>hovered</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> shoulder of his wife, leading her to exclaim: [...] "Oh, Christ! It has seized me!" [...] Other nameless and formless terrors have been reported, more recently, by night staff at the Tower.|$|E

2500|$|The Rabbis {{taught in}} a Baraita that once Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah was {{standing}} on a step on the Temple Mount, and Ben Zoma (who was younger than Rabbi Joshua) saw him but did not stand up before him in respect. So Rabbi Joshua asked Ben Zoma what was up. Ben Zoma replied that {{he was staring at}} the space between the upper and the lower waters (described in [...] ). Ben Zoma said that there is only a bare three fingers' space between the upper and the lower waters. Ben Zoma reasoned that [...] says, [...] "And the spirit of God <b>hovered</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> face of the waters," [...] implying a distance similar to that of a mother dove that hovers over her young without touching them. But Rabbi Joshua told his disciples that Ben Zoma was still outside the realm of understanding. Rabbi Joshua noted that [...] says that [...] "the spirit of God <b>hovered</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> face of the water" [...] {{on the first day of}} Creation, but God divided the waters on the second day, as [...] reports. (And thus the distance that God hovered above the waters need not be the distance between the upper and lower waters). The Gemara presented various views of how great the distance is between the upper and the lower waters. Rav Aha bar Jacob said that the distance was a hair's breadth. The Rabbis said that the distance was like that between the planks of a bridge. Mar Zutra (or some say Rav Assi) said that the distance was like that between two cloaks spread one over another. And others said that the distance was like that between two cups nested one inside the other..|$|E

[...] At 14:20, the 11 survivors from the Guardia di Finanza's ship arrived at the Vlora seaport. The survivors were sent to the hospital for medical care and one was airlifted by helicopter to Tirana for further medical assistance.

2500|$|Edom is {{described}} in Genesis as the descendents of Esau. In the Kabbalistic scheme, this is identified with unrectified Gevurah - Severity, {{the source of the}} vessels of the World of Tohu - Chaos. The eight kings listed who reigned in Edom before any king of Israel, embodied the eight sefirot of Daat to Malchut in the World of Tohu, the vessels that shattered. Of each it says they lived and died, death connoting the soul-light of the sefirot ascending back to its source, while the body-vessel descends-shatters. Attached to the broken vessels are the holy residues of the former light as Nitzot - [...] "Sparks" [...] of holiness, sustaining Creation by the Divine flow of Will. The sparks are the creative force of the sefirot down the Four Worlds. The unabsorbed residue of the broken vessels in our physical, lowest World Assiah becomes the realm of Kelipot impurity. Genesis 1:2, [...] "...And the Spirit of God <b>hovered</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> waters." [...] Merachepet - [...] "hovered" [...] splits into the number [...] "288 died", the root number of Divine sparks that then subdivide into innumerable fragments.|$|E
2500|$|The {{historian}} Tony Joseph wrote: [...] "But Green was not {{the only}} member of the Company to leave.... Ella Halman left too. [...] So did Richard Watson ... Margaret Mitchell ... Radley Flynn and no fewer than twenty-two other small part players and choristers. [...] It was the largest single exodus of performers in D'Oyly Carte history, and that was why the sense of sadness that <b>hovered</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> season was so marked.... August 1951 was the end of an era. Cynthia Morey, who joined the Company just before the defections, wrote: [...] "I have never found out precisely why this great exodus took place.... We were always under the impression that we should feel honoured to be in the employ of the D’Oyly Carte Opera Company; it was patently obvious that the management held firmly to the policy that nobody is indispensable". [...] Morey noted that Evans had played several roles with the company and commented, [...] "In 1927 she was apparently demoted to the chorus, and there she remained for [...] ... I should not have thought these qualifications sufficient for such an important post; to spend all those years as a chorister seems to signify a lack of ambition or achievement. [...] But I suppose a 'Director of Productions' in those days merely needed to know every move and every gesture, and exactly when they occurred, for no departure from the set production was ever permitted." [...] Richard Walker, Kenneth Sandford and others also criticised Evans's temperament and methods. [...] She retired as stage director in 1953, the year that her husband died, but she was engaged to coach new D'Oyly Carte principals in their roles for some years thereafter.|$|E
2500|$|Rav Judah said in Rav's {{name that}} ten things were created {{on the first}} day: (1) heaven, (2) earth, (3) chaos ( [...] , tohu), (4) desolation or void ( [...] , bohu), (5) light, (6) darkness, (7) wind, (8) water, (9) {{the length of a}} day, and (10) the length of a night. The Gemara cited verses to support Rav Judah's proposition: heaven and earth, as [...] says, [...] "In the {{beginning}} God created heaven and earth"; tohu and bohu, as [...] says, [...] "and the earth was tohu and bohu"; darkness, as [...] says, [...] "and darkness was upon the face of the deep; light, as [...] says, [...] "And God said, ‘Let there be light'"; wind and water, as [...] says, [...] "and the wind of God <b>hovered</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> face of the waters"; and the length of a day and the length of a night, as [...] says, [...] "And there was evening and there was morning, one day." [...] A Baraita taught that tohu (chaos) is a green line that encompasses the world, out of which darkness proceeds, as [...] says, [...] "He made darkness His hiding-place round about Him"; and bohu (desolation) means the slimy stones in the deep out of which the waters proceed, as [...] says, [...] "He shall stretch over it the line of confusion (tohu) and the plummet of emptiness (bohu)." [...] The Gemara questioned Rav Judah's assertion that light was created on the first day, as [...] reports that [...] "God made the two great lights [...] [...] [...] and God set them in the firmament of the heaven," [...] and [...] reports that God did so on the fourth day. The Gemara explained that the light of which Rav Judah taught was the light of which Rabbi Eleazar spoke when he said that by the light that God created on the first day, one could see {{from one end of the}} world to the other; but as soon as God saw the corrupt generations of the Flood and the Dispersion, God hid the light from them, as [...] says, [...] "But from the wicked their light is withheld." [...] Rather, God reserved the light of the first day for the righteous in the time to come, as [...] says, [...] "And God saw the light, that it was good." [...] The Gemara noted a dispute among the Tannaim over this interpretation. Rabbi Jacob agreed with the view that by the light that God created on the first day one could see from one end of the world to the other. But the Sages equated the light created on the first day with the lights of which [...] speaks, which God created on the first day, but placed in the heavens on the fourth day..|$|E
