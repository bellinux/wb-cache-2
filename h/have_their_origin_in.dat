Both games <b>have</b> <b>their</b> <b>origin</b> <b>in</b> varieties of football played in Britain in the mid-19th century, in which a football is kicked at a goal or kicked over a line, which in turn were based on the varieties of English public school football games.|$|E
5|$|The oldest known sundial is from Egypt; it {{dates back}} to around 1500 (19th Dynasty), and was {{discovered}} in the Valley of the Kings in 2013.

Ancient Egyptian obelisks, constructed about 3500, are also among the earliest shadow clocks.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{characteristic}} traits of the Shulaverian material culture (circular mudbrick architecture, pottery decorated by plastic design, anthropomorphic female figurines, obsidian industry {{with an emphasis}} on production of long prismatic blades) are believed to <b>have</b> <b>their</b> <b>origin</b> <b>in</b> the Near Eastern Neolithic (Hassuna, Halaf).|$|E

25|$|Symbols used in astrology {{overlap with}} {{those used in}} {{astronomy}} because of the historical overlap between the two subjects.

25|$|The labyrintodonts <b>have</b> <b>their</b> <b>origin</b> <b>in</b> {{the early}} middle Devonian (398-392 Mya) or {{possibly}} earlier.

25|$|Hyperbolas {{share many}} of the ellipses' {{analytical}} properties such as eccentricity, focus, and directrix.

25|$|The common {{ancestors}} of the Eskimo and the Aleut (as well as various Paleo-Siberian groups) are believed by archaeologists to <b>have</b> <b>their</b> <b>origin</b> <b>in</b> eastern Siberia. Migrating east, they reached the Bering Sea area about 10,000 years ago. Research on blood types and linguistics suggests that the {{ancestors of}} American Indians reached North America in waves of migration before the {{ancestors of the}} Eskimo and Aleut; there were three major waves of migration from Siberia to the Americas {{by way of the}} Bering land bridge. This causeway became exposed between 20,000 and 8,000 years ago during periods of glaciation.|$|E
25|$|The oldest {{university}} is the University of Coimbra founded in 1290. The largest university, by number of enrolled students, is the University of Porto - with approximately 28,000 students. The Catholic University of Portugal, the oldest non-state-run university (concordatary status), was instituted by decree of the Holy See {{and has been}} recognized by the State of Portugal since 1971. A few polytechnical higher education institutions, though formed as such in the 1980s, <b>have</b> <b>their</b> <b>origin</b> <b>in</b> 19th century educational institutions - {{this is the case}} of the Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa, the Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto and the Escola Superior Agrária de Coimbra.|$|E
25|$|The {{architecture}} has major Greek influences, {{while some}} Iranian elements {{from the beginning}} are observable. The architectural decorations in Nisa are usually purely Greek. There were Ionic and Corinthian capitals with acanthus leaves. Nisa's battlements and fortifications, however, <b>have</b> <b>their</b> <b>origin</b> <b>in</b> a more Iranian fashion. The square house in Nisa is 38 x 38 meters in size and consists of a large courtyard which is decorated on all four sides by columns. Behind it are found on all four sides elongated rooms, on whose walls are benches. The building perhaps served as a royal treasury and was built of unbaked bricks. The builders were likely following contemporary fashions, recalling {{the construction of a}} Greek palaestrae. Overall, Nisa appears as a colonial, Hellenistic Royal Court, which hardly differs from other contemporary Hellenistic residences. This is also evident to observe in Ai Khanoum where a royal residence of the Greek-Bactrian kingdom was excavated. Schlumberger desires that these examples, therefore, not be classified as Parthian.|$|E

If the field at the core-mantle boundary is fit to spherical harmonics, the dipole part is smaller by a factor of about 8 at the surface, the quadrupole part by a factor of 16, and so on.

500|$|Structure C-79 is a {{circular}} three-tiered platform built during the Terminal Classic {{on top of}} a pre-existing structure dating to the Late Preclassic Period. Circular structures such as this [...] <b>have</b> <b>their</b> <b>origin</b> <b>in</b> central Mexico, where they are typically temples of Ehecatl, the god of wind. However, the structure at Seibal was surmounted by a rectangular building platform, whereas the temple buildings of Ehecatl were also circular. StructureC-79 has two stairways, the larger ascends the west side, the smaller is on the east side. A circular jaguar altar rests on three pedestals before the structure, two of these are crouching figures that originally supported the altar, the third central column is modern and was put in place as an additional support during restoration of the ruins. The altar has the crude representation of a jaguar's head carved onto its edge. StructureC-79 and the associated altar are dated to about AD 870.|$|E
