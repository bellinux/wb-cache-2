40|$|Bicarbonate {{alkalinity}} {{plays an}} important role in the stability of biological reactors used in wastewater treatment, primarily in anaerobic systems. As some wastewaters tend to acidify readily, addition of an external alkali source may be necessary to maintain process stability. An assessment was made of the effect of sodium bicarbonate addition on the determination of solids concentration. The methodology consisted in accompanying a series of solids concentrations (total solids, TS; total volatile solids, TVS; and total <b>fixed</b> <b>solids,</b> TFS) in samples containing cheese whey and volatile acids used to simulate anaerobic reactor effluents. TS, TVS and TFS showed to be strongly affected by NaHCO 3 addition, mainly due to an increase in TFS. This effect could be quantified by relating the experimental values to the theoretical ones from the stoichiometric equations for NaHCO 3 decomposition and other compounds (sodium acetate and sodium propionate) formation with temperature increase. In this way, as one of the main parameters of assessing liquid effluent treatment systems is the reduction in solids present in the medium, the concentration of solids can be quantified more adequately by determining <b>fixed</b> <b>solids</b> from the inorganic salts present. This methodology showed to be adequate in cases where a significant amount of alkali is added...|$|E

40|$|PigBal is a {{mass balance}} model that uses pig diet, {{digestibility}} and production data {{to predict the}} manure solids and nutrients produced by pig herds. It has been widely used for designing piggery effluent treatment systems and sustainable reuse areas at Australian piggeries. More recently, PigBal has also been used to estimate piggery volatile solids production for assessing greenhouse gas emissions for statutory reporting purposes by government, and for evaluating the energy potential from anaerobic digestion of pig effluent. This paper has compared PigBal predictions of manure total, volatile, and <b>fixed</b> <b>solids,</b> and nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), with manure production data generated in a replicated trial, which involved collecting manure from pigs housed in metabolic pens. Predictions of total, volatile, and <b>fixed</b> <b>solids</b> and K in the excreted manure were relatively good (combined diet R 2 ≥ 0. 79, modelling efficiency (EF) ≥ 0. 70) whereas predictions of N and P, were generally less accurate (combined diet R 2 0. 56 and 0. 66, EF 0. 19 and - 0. 22, respectively). PigBal generally under-predicted lower N values while over-predicting higher values, and generally over-predicted manure P production for all diets. The most likely causes for this less accurate performance were ammonium-N volatilisation losses between manure excretion and sample analysis, and the inability of PigBal to account for higher rates of P uptake by pigs fed diets containing phytase. The outcomes of this research {{suggest that there is}} a need for further investigation and model development to enhance PigBal's capabilities for more accurately assessing nutrient loads. However, PigBal's satisfactory performance in predicting solids excretion demonstrates that it is suitable for assessing the methane component of greenhouse gas emission and the energy potential from anaerobic digestion of volatile solids in piggery effluent. The apparent overestimation of N and P excretion may result in conservative nutrient application rates to land and the over-prediction of the nitrous oxide component of greenhouse gas emissions. © CSIRO 2016...|$|E

We applied it to two different tumors and fixation methods to separate neoplastic from non-neoplastic cells in primary colorectal cancers and metastatic breast cancers, and were able to enrich to a high degree of purity. Immunomagnetic separation was effective in unembedded fixed tissue as well as fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. The magnetically separated cells were amenable to fluorescence in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction amplification of their DNA with minimal additional manipulation. The high degree of enrichment achieved before amplification contributed to interpretation of loss of heterozygosity in metastatic breast cancers, and simplified fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis because only neoplastic cells were hybridized and counted.

The study aim was to characterise dairy shed effluent from a commercial farm and examine the changes produced by treatment, storage and recycling of the effluent through a two-stage stabilisation pond system. The data and insights from the study are broadly applicable to passive pond systems servicing intensive dairy and other livestock operations. Raw effluent contained mostly poorly biodegradable particulate organic material and organically bound nutrients, as well as a large fraction of <b>fixed</b> <b>solids</b> due to effluent recycling. The anaerobic pond provided effective sedimentation and biological treatment, but hydrolysis of organic material occurred predominantly in the sludge and continually added to effluent soluble COD, nutrients and cations. Sludge digestion also suppressed pH in the pond and increased salt levels through formation of alkalinity. High sludge levels significantly impaired pond treatment performance. In the facultative pond, BOD 5 concentrations were halved; however smaller reductions in COD showed the refractory nature of incoming organic material. Reductions in soluble N and P were proportional to reductions in respective particulate forms, suggesting that respective removal mechanisms were not independent. Conditions in the ponds were unlikely to support biological nutrient removal. Recycling caused conservative inert constituents to accumulate within the pond system.

40|$|In {{teaching}} a multivariable calculus course, two main difficulties facing the student are to draw surfaces in three-dimensions, and to setup and calculate tedious triple integrals. The added third dimension causes great difficulty {{even to the}} well prepared student who has successfully finished a two semester single variable calculus course. The student must now suddenly think in three-dimensions. Visualizing and drawing the corresponding three– dimensional surfaces pose a significant challenge to the novice. To alleviate the problem, the student and the instructor must resort to the modern technologies. Computer algebra systems (CAS) such as Mathematica and Maple are well equipped to handle such tasks. The paper has two goals: One goal is to demonstrate the usage of the CAS Mathematica to learn some standard topics of a multivariable calculus course, such as vectors, partial derivatives, graphing of three-dimensional objects, and multiple integrals. As the second, but most important goal of the paper, we will consider the special topic {{of the center of}} gravity of solid objects. This topic was chosen because it uses very many of the techniques learned in a multivariable calculus course. We will show how to use the CAS Mathematica to evaluate tedious triple integrals arising in calculating the center of gravity. Mathematica can also be used as a visualization tool to draw the graphs of three-dimensional solids under consideration. Usually a standard multivariable course only considers the center of gravity of <b>fixed</b> <b>solids.</b> However, with the aid of Mathematica, the students are in an ideal position to consider variable solids as well. Thus, the paper introduces the novel concept of the locus of the center of gravity of certain types of variable solids. The paper also illustrates several facets of A CAS in undergraduate education – the usage of a CAS as a computational tool, visualization tool, experimentation tool, and a conjecture-forming tool...|$|E

The gas leaving the reactor has been analysed to measure the CO 2 and O 2 concentrations and, consequently, to evaluate the overall CO 2 removal efficiency. In order to study the influence of solid sorbent type (i. e. CaO, coal bottom ash, limestone and blast furnace slag) and of mass and heat transfer processes on CO 2 removal efficiency, a one-dimensional time dependent mathematical model of the reactor, which may be considered a Plug Flow Reactor, has been developed. The quality of the model has been confirmed using the experimental results...|$|R

40|$|The {{rheological}} {{study of}} the slurry containing ball clay and using different deflocculant (Sodium Silicate) concentration has been done. Slurry with different solid loading are prepared by taking ball clay and water in different proportions with solid loading 30 %, 35 % and 40 % (by volume). Deflocculant with different concentrations are mixed with different slurries (with different solid loading). Deflocuculant with 5 different proportions was taken. Defloculant with 0. 25 %, 0. 5 %, 0. 75 %, 1 % and 1. 25 % (weight %) of the clay were taken and poured in a plastic bottle with alumina balls for wet milling for 12 hrs. Rheology of the slurry was then studied by measuring the viscosity, sedimentation height and zeta potential of the slurry. Further with this optimized solid loading (30 Vol% Solid Loading) {{and the amount of}} deflocculant (0. 85 wt. % of Ball clay), ceramic porous body was prepared with this <b>fixed</b> <b>solid</b> loading, but varying the ratio of ball clay and wheat flour. In this <b>fixed</b> <b>solid</b> loading, the wheat flour and ball clay was varied in the ratio 10 : 90, 20 : 80, 30 : 70, 40 : 60 and 50 : 50 by volume. The different slurry was prepared with varying ratio of wheat flour and ball clay as mentioned above. In this slurry, the amount of deflocculant was fixed 0. 85 % (wt %) of the total ball clay taken. These slurries were mixed through pot milling for 12 hours. Then the slurry was casted in a metal mold and kept at drier for 24 hours to get a cylindrical shaped body which was later fired at a different temperature. Different samples were fired at different temperatures to get the final ceramic porous body. Samples were fried at 11000 C, 12000 C and 13000 C. Then characterization of the prepared ceramic porous body was done by determining Drying Shrinkage, Firing shrinkage, Apparent Porosity, Bulk Density and Cold Crushing strengt...|$|R
