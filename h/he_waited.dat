5|$|As <b>he</b> <b>waited</b> for the Emperor's {{confirmation}} of his directorship, Mahler shared duties as a resident conductor with Joseph Hellmesberger Jr. (son {{of the former}} conservatory director) and Hans Richter, an internationally renowned interpreter of Wagner and the conductor of the original Ring cycle at Bayreuth in 1876. Director Wilhelm Jahn had not consulted Richter about Mahler's appointment; Mahler, sensitive to the situation, wrote Richter a complimentary letter expressing unswerving admiration for the older conductor. Subsequently, the two were rarely in agreement, but kept their divisions private.|$|E
5|$|Flamininus {{moved his}} camp to the {{position}} where the skirmish had occurred. For a day <b>he</b> <b>waited</b> for the Spartans to attack him but, when no attack came, he called a war council to discuss {{whether or not to}} press the siege. All the Greek leaders except Aristaenos thought that they should attack the city, as capturing it was their primary objective in going to war. Aristaenos, on the other hand, argued that they should instead strike directly at Sparta and Laconia. Flamininus agreed with Aristaenos and the army marched to Tegea in Arcadia. The next day, Flamininus advanced to Caryae, where <b>he</b> <b>waited</b> for allied auxiliaries to reinforce him. These forces soon arrived and joined the Romans; they consisted of a contingent of Spartan exiles led by Agesipolis, the legitimate King of Sparta, who had been overthrown by the first Tyrant of Sparta, Lycurgus, twenty years earlier, and 1,500 Macedonians with 400 Thessalian cavalry sent by Philip. News also reached the allies that several fleets had arrived off the Laconian shore: a Roman fleet under Lucius Quinctius with forty ships; a Rhodian fleet with eighteen ships, led by Sosilas, hoping that the defeat of Nabis would stop the pirates that plagued their ships; and a Pergamene fleet of forty ships under King Eumenes II of Pergamum, who hoped to gain more favor with Rome and Roman support if Antiochus invaded.|$|E

On 10 July, Charles evacuated Malsch {{and ordered a}} forced march east to Pforzheim via Karlsruhe. Also on the 10th, the French occupied Ettlingen and Neuenbürg. Anxious to protect his magazines at Heilbronn, Charles halted at Pforzheim for a few days. For his part, Moreau would not believe that Charles had given up, so <b>he</b> <b>waited</b> around Ettlingen for several days. Meanwhile, the Austrians packed their supplies into wagons and headed east on 14 July. The next day, Moreau moved on Pforzheim but found the archduke gone.|$|E
5|$|Isa ibn Musa, the Caliph's nephew, {{was sent}} against Medina with 4,000 men, but Muhammad refused {{to abandon the}} holy city and insisted on meeting the Abbasid attack there. In the meantime, he imitated the actions of Muhammad, like {{restoring}} the famous ditch around the city. Muhammad's supporters nevertheless began deserting him. When Isa appeared before the city, <b>he</b> <b>waited</b> {{a few days before}} the ditch and repeatedly offered amnesty. Then his troops laid a few doors over the ditch and entered Medina, where Muhammad and his remaining 300 supporters fell fighting on 6 December 762. Muhammad's corpse was beheaded and his head dispatched to the Caliph.|$|E

Red Auerbach, Boston's general manager lived in the Washington, D.C. area, and had been a {{longtime}} fan of Washington's. Pat stayed behind as the couple had two young children, and Washington would be staying in a hotel.

5|$|To his surprise, Wellesley {{found the}} entire {{combined}} army before him. Nevertheless, he resolved to attack at once, believing that if <b>he</b> <b>waited</b> for Stevenson, the Marathas {{would have the}} chance to slip away and force the pursuit to drag on. Wellesley was also eager to forge a reputation for himself, and despite his numerical disadvantage, he was confident that the Maratha’s irregular forces would be swept aside by his disciplined troops, and only Scindia’s regular infantry could be expected to stand and fight.|$|E

On arrival, Hines apologized to the captain and gave him five dollars. Hines' exploit led to the mistaken rumor that Booth had escaped into Canada.|$|E

5|$|World War II was raging at this time, {{and someone}} with a {{doctorate}} in such a topic area was highly sought after by the wartime Manhattan Project, but Reynolds turned down an offer to join it. An avid surf fisherman and sailor, he aspired to join the United States Navy. He attempted to enlist, but was turned down because he wore glasses. He then lobbied the Navy, which waived this requirement. He was then commissioned as an ensign in 1943, and married Virginia Rendall, a librarian, while <b>he</b> <b>waited</b> for his first assignment.|$|E
5|$|After high school, Shoup {{attended}} DePauw University {{where he}} was one of 100 awarded the Edward Rector Scholarship, giving him full tuition. Majoring in mathematics, he joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity and maintained high marks, narrowly failing the selection criteria for Phi Beta Kappa Society. He was on the track and field and rifle teams, and also competed in the wrestling and football teams. He won the Indiana and Kentucky Amateur Athletic Union marathon in 1925. <b>He</b> <b>waited</b> tables, washed dishes and worked in a cement factory to help pay his expenses. Lack of funds compelled him to take a year off after his junior year to teach school, and his expenses were further strained when he contracted a severe case of pneumonia and incurred hospital bills. He opted to enroll in the Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) to offset his living expenses, and later recalled that this was the only reason he joined the military. He graduated from DePauw in 1926.|$|E
5|$|After the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II in 1917, the new Russian Provisional Government in Petrograd {{had little}} {{influence}} over Ukraine. Khrushchev {{was elected to}} the worker's council (or soviet) in Rutchenkovo, and in May he became its chairman. He did not join the Bolsheviks until 1918, a year in which the Russian Civil War, between the Bolsheviks and a coalition of opponents known as the White Army, began in earnest. His biographer, William Taubman, suggests that Khrushchev's delay in affiliating himself with the Bolsheviks was because he felt closer to the Mensheviks who prioritized economic progress, whereas the Bolsheviks sought political power. In his memoirs, Khrushchev indicated that <b>he</b> <b>waited</b> because there were many groups, and it was difficult to keep them all straight.|$|E

5|$|Although {{popular with}} groupies, Chrisye had rarely dated. But in early 1981 he began courting Guruh Sukarnoputra's secretary, Gusti Firoza Damayanti Noor (Yanti). Yanti, of mixed Dayak and Minang ancestry, {{was a former}} singer and came from a musically {{inclined}} family; she would often discuss music with Chrisye while <b>he</b> <b>waited</b> for Guruh, and he would also see her when visiting her brother Raidy, one of his friends. When she moved to Bali {{to work at a}} five-star hotel there for several weeks, Chrisye followed her and told her that he would marry her when she returned to Jakarta; although this was not a formal proposal, Yanti accepted. In 1982 Chrisye converted to Islam, as Islam does not permit interfaith marriages between Muslim women and non-Muslim men, and changed his name to Chrismansyah Rahadi; Chrisye at the time had been growing increasingly discontent and disillusioned with Christianity. On 12 December 1982 he married Yanti in a Padang-style wedding.|$|E
5|$|At around 20:30, Goebbels and Magda {{left the}} bunker {{and walked up}} to the garden of the Chancellery, where they {{committed}} suicide. There are several different accounts of this event. According to one account, Goebbels shot Magda and then himself. Another account was that they each bit on a cyanide ampule and were given a coup de grâce immediately afterwards. Goebbels' SS adjutant Günther Schwägermann testified in 1948 that they walked ahead of him up the stairs and out into the Chancellery garden. <b>He</b> <b>waited</b> in the stairwell and heard the shots sound. Schwägermann then walked up the remaining stairs and, once outside, saw their lifeless bodies. Following Goebbels' prior order, Schwägermann had an SS soldier fire several shots into his body, which did not move.|$|E

Due to this treatment, he elected to play for the American hockey program at Shattuck-Saint Mary's Boarding School, Minnesota for the 2002–03 hockey season.

5|$|Following the Rangers' defeat, he {{announced}} his retirement from the NHL on 4 May 2009, {{at the age of}} 35. Näslund had informed Rangers general manager Glen Sather, head coach John Tortorella, and his teammates of his intention to retire prior to the team's playoff elimination. By announcing his retirement early in the off-season, Näslund forfeited a $2million buyout from the Rangers, which would have counted against the team's salary cap for the following season had <b>he</b> <b>waited</b> until he was formally bought out. Näslund retired from the NHL second among all-time Swedish players with 395 goals (behind Mats Sundin's 564; he retired the same year). His 869 points ranked fifth, while his 1,117 games played ranked fourth.|$|E

Jose Sarria was approved and entered the Army Reserve, continuing his studies as <b>he</b> <b>waited</b> to be called up to active duty. Shortly before he was scheduled for induction in the regular Army, his beloved second father, Charles Millen, died of a heart attack.

For several weeks Willaumez's lookouts saw nothing, the British holding the convoy back until they obtained some information about the location of the French squadron. During the night of 31 July, bored with waiting for the convoy, Captain Jérôme Bonaparte sailed northwards away from the squadron, acting without orders or even notifying his admiral. When dawn broke on 1 August, Willaumez was panicked by the disappearance of Vétéran and, assuming that the ship had somehow been accidentally separated, began to search for the missing vessel and its important commander.|$|E
