5|$|The {{mesosphere}} of Venus can {{be divided}} into two layers: the lower one between 62–73km and the upper one between 73–95km. In the <b>first</b> <b>layer</b> the temperature is nearly constant at 230K (−43°C). This layer coincides with the upper cloud deck. In the second layer temperature starts to decrease again reaching about 165K (−108°C) at the altitude of 95km, where mesopause begins. It is the coldest part of the Venusian dayside atmosphere. In the dayside mesopause, which serves as a boundary between the mesophere and thermosphere and is located between 95–120km, temperature increases to a constant—about 300–400K (27–127°C)—value prevalent in the thermosphere. In contrast, the nightside Venusian thermosphere is the coldest place on Venus with temperature as low as 100K (−173°C). It is even called a cryosphere.|$|E

For <b>first</b> capping <b>layers</b> up to 3. 5 nm, the height of the QDs correspond to the thickness of the <b>first</b> capping <b>layer.</b> Nevertheless, for thicknesses higher than 3. 5 nm, a reduction in the dot height compared to the thickness of the <b>first</b> capping <b>layer</b> is observed.

5|$|The episode filmed {{for eight}} days. In one sequence, Carl Grimes sparks up a {{cigarette}} lighter and drops {{it onto a}} horde of walkers after Rick creates a diversion to distract the walkers. Greg Nicotero, the special effect director for The Walking Dead, used black panels to capture {{the elements of the}} fire; this enabled them to edit the flames onto the walkers. To reduce the chances of getting burned, the stuntmen put on several layers of flame retardant suits. The <b>first</b> <b>layer</b> consisted of a dry Nomex undergarment; this was followed by several layers of Nomex clothing that were gelled. Since the sequence was conducted on multiple occasions, the stuntmen were coated with gel containing cationic polymers. The last layer was a raincoat, which would separate the gel from the stuntmen's clothing and allowed them to be engulfed in flames for several seconds without injury.|$|E
