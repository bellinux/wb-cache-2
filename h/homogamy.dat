50|$|<b>Homogamy</b> is {{marriage}} between individuals who are, in some culturally important way, similar to each other. <b>Homogamy</b> may {{be based on}} socioeconomic status, class, gender, ethnicity, or religion, or age {{in the case of}} the so-called age <b>homogamy.</b> It is a form of assortative mating.|$|E
50|$|<b>Homogamy</b> is {{the broader}} {{precursor}} {{of what is}} endogamy, which encompasses <b>homogamy</b> in its definition but also includes an open refusal of others {{on the basis of}} conflicting traits, appearances and fiscal worth. <b>Homogamy</b> is much less rigid in structure—one can have differences in particular denominations of Christianity for example, but will not be a focused point of contention in the relationship.|$|E
50|$|Inbreeding can be {{referred}} to as <b>homogamy.</b>|$|E
50|$|Many {{people choose}} <b>homogamy,</b> and marry someone {{similar to their}} own group because of the similar life {{experiences}} they have been through. They may {{share some of the}} same opinions and views about specific things, and they have access to the same way of living. Another reason people often chose <b>homogamy</b> is because of geographic proximity. This basically means that people find partners who live in a close proximity to themselves. Since they are choosing partners that live close, this falls under <b>homogamy,</b> as they usually will share similar traits and characteristics, like social class, for example. It is common for people to choose <b>homogamy,</b> or fall into <b>homogamy,</b> because of a few important reasons. The first reason could be because of geographic segregation. Certain communities hold very strong ties that bring together their culture and feel obligated that they must stay within this community to hold these ties together and keep them strong. Another part of geographic segregation is discrimination; people feel as if they are not accepted and may be discriminated by people who are of different background than them.|$|E

50|$|In sociology, {{heterogamy}} {{refers to}} a marriage between two individuals that differ in a certain criterion, and is contrasted with <b>homogamy</b> for a marriage or union between partners that match according to that criterion. For example, ethnic heterogamy refers to marriages involving individuals of different ethnic groups. Age heterogamy refers to marriages involving partners of significantly different ages. Heterogamy and <b>homogamy</b> are also used to describe marriage or union between people of unlike and like sex (or gender) respectively.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Homogamy</b> {{can also}} fall under gender. In this case, <b>homogamy</b> would refer to two {{partners}} {{of the same}} gender marrying one another. Same sex couples have {{much more of a}} variation connection among straight sex couples. Same sex couples are more open-minded, democratic, and accepting of nontraditional relationships [...] These groups of couples have shaped social norms from age to education to relationships across race/ethnic lines. Same-sex couples are likely to engage themselves in relationships around different races or ethnicity because of their mind set.|$|E
50|$|<b>Homogamy</b> {{has been}} {{suggested}} as a term for same-sex marriage or other union, and heterogamy as a term for marriage or union between people of different sexes.|$|E

5000|$|The {{effect and}} {{occurrence}} of heterophily is also analyzed in intimate relationships. In Dangerous Liaisons? Dating and Drinking Diffusion in Adolescent Peer Networks, Derek Kreager and Dana Haynie mention {{the effects of}} heteroplhily on romantic relationships. They see {{the removal of the}} barrier of gender as a departure from the homophily of peer friendships. According to Kreager and Haynie [...] "exposure to new behaviors and social contexts associated with a dating partner may also correspond to higher levels of influence from that partner." [...] The terms <b>homogamy,</b> endogamy, and exogamy are often used when discussing intimate relationships in a sociological context. <b>Homogamy</b> refers to the tendency of individuals to marry others that share similarities with each other, while endogamy is the practice of marrying within a specific group. The relation between these terms and homophily is the tendency to be attracted to what is similar. <b>Homogamy</b> and endogamy may be a result of cultural practices or personal preference. Endogamy's antithesis, exogamy, is marriage only outside of a particular group.|$|E
5000|$|Filter {{theory is}} a sociological theory {{concerning}} dating and mate selection. It proposes that social structure limits {{the number of}} eligible candidates for a mate. Most often, this takes place due to <b>homogamy,</b> as people seek to date and marry only those similar to them (characteristics that are often taken into account are age, race, social status and religion). <b>Homogamy</b> {{is the idea of}} marriage between spouses who share similar characteristics, where heterogamy denotes marriage between spouses of different characteristics. The idea of [...] "opposites attract: is heterogamous as well as the idea that one spouse has complementing, not similar characteristics to the other.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} {{outliers}} {{in the study}} of interpersonal relationships that tend to favor the marital union of two persons beyond that of their ethnicity, religion or socio-economic status. Regardless, they all return to the attractions of similarities that make up <b>homogamy.</b>|$|E
50|$|Ellison and Curtis (2002) {{wrote that}} {{decisions}} on {{issues relating to}} family matters may result in greater consensus among couples who choose <b>homogamy.</b> Also, Church attendance provides a close network of support for couples. Marital separation between couples attending a denominational and non-denominational church is generally frowned upon and stigmatized.|$|E
50|$|Around the world, {{there are}} three themes {{regarding}} the criteria with which people evaluate potential mates. They are: warmth and loyalty, attractiveness and vitality, and status and resources. These three themes can heavily shape themselves around the tertiary traits of ethnicity, religion and socio-economic status, the three particular themes surrounding <b>homogamy.</b>|$|E
50|$|Heterophily {{is usually}} not a term found often by itself. Rather it is often used in {{conjunction}} with other similar terms that define attraction. Heterophily is often discussed with its opposite, homophily when analyzing how relationships form between people. Heterophily also may be mentioned in areas such as <b>homogamy,</b> exogamy, and endogamy.|$|E

50|$|<b>Homogamy</b> {{refers to}} the {{maturation}} {{of male and female}} reproductive organs at the same time, which is also known as simultaneous or synchronous hermaphrodism and is the antonym of dichogamy. Many flowers appear to be homogamous but some of these may not be strictly functionally homogamous, because for various reasons male and female reproduction do not completely overlap.|$|E
50|$|Many {{children}} were expected by parents to marry people similar to or within their group. A {{small percentage of}} all marriages were inter-racial marriage (opposite to <b>homogamy)</b> and went against the norm to marry a person within one of the similar aspects of culture, race, background, religion and class. These marriages have been said to attract attention and curiosity, along with many who disapprove this type of marriage.|$|E
50|$|Sexual {{preference}} {{creates a}} tendency towards assortative mating or <b>homogamy.</b> The general conditions of sexual discrimination {{appear to be}} (1) the acceptance of one mate precludes the effective acceptance of alternative mates, and (2) the rejection of an offer is followed by other offers, either certainly, or at such high chance {{that the risk of}} non-occurrence is smaller than the chance advantage to be gained by selecting a mate.|$|E
50|$|Education {{plays an}} {{important}} role in a same sex relationship. This is because their education level allows them to express themselves in society and stand for their rights. Couples who are in same sex relationships are likely to live in urban areas than different sex couples. A study has showed that same sex couples who identify themselves as a bachelor may have a different cohort. However, couples who register their marriage with the state have a higher level of education than those who do not. In addition, same sex couples who are in a serious relationship are more likely to marry than those that identify themselves as unmarried couples. Since 1990-2000, same sex couples have not been reported as much different than straight sex couples in regards to relationship. Nevertheless, same-sex relationship, marriage or cohabitation has changed over time. The number of same-sex relationship has increased and same-sex relationships have become more accepted in western societies. Same sex relationships can relate to <b>homogamy,</b> as many people may feel more comfortable being with someone of their same gender, who can relate to them easier. Therefore, same-sex relationships fall under <b>homogamy.</b>|$|E
50|$|One’s {{ethnicity}} {{can easily}} link {{us to the}} biological vitality and looks {{that we will be}} born with. One’s socio-economic status self-implies your platform of status and resources. And one’s religious or spiritual beliefs can have a hand in how we perceive and treat others around us, and often we tend to be warmer and more trustworthy to those with similar beliefs. All things considered, <b>homogamy</b> is an unsurprising phenomenon of interpersonal relationships regarding the liking and nurturing of others who are like us, may look like us, and act like ourselves.|$|E
50|$|Most {{countries}} look at {{the educational}} status because {{it is easier for}} them judge the individual. The trends of socioeconomic <b>homogamy</b> are studied by the analysis of class, background and education. There has been a decline in a few industrialized countries regarding the importance of the social background for marriage choice; United States, Hungary, France and the Netherlands. (Kalmijn, 17). Today parents don’t have any control over their children as the kids spend more time at college or university, increasing their social background. Education has become important for both the cultural taste and socioeconomic status. After education, falls the romantic consideration, when high standard of living is everyone’s main goal.|$|E
50|$|Migrant {{minority}} ethnic {{populations have}} limited choice of partners, {{particularly when they}} are stereotyped, segregated or avoided by the majority population. This encourages <b>homogamy</b> and arranged marriages within the ethnic group. Examples of this dynamic include Sikh marriages between 1910 and 1980 in Canada, homogamous quasi-arranged marriages between European descent South Africans, arranged marriages among Hasidic Jews, and arranged marriages among Japanese American immigrants before the 1960s, who would travel back to Japan, to marry the spouse arranged by the family, and then return married. In other cases, a girl from Japan would arrive in the United States as a picture bride, pre-arranged to marry the Japanese American man on arrival, whom she had never met.|$|E
50|$|Another {{interpretation}} for storge {{is to be}} used {{to describe}} a sexual relationship between two people that gradually grew out of a friendship—storgic lovers sometimes cannot pinpoint the moment that friendship turned to love. Storgic lovers are friends first, and the friendship, and the storge, can endure even beyond the breakup of the sexual relationship. They want their significant others to also be their best friends, and will choose their mates based on similar goals and interests - <b>homogamy.</b> Storgic lovers place much importance on commitment, and find that their motivation to avoid committing infidelity is to preserve the trust between the two partners. Children and marriage are seen as legitimate longterm aims for their bond, while passionate sexual intensity is of lesser importance than in other love styles.|$|E
50|$|It {{is often}} seen that people choose to marry within their sociological group or {{with someone who is}} close to them in status. Characteristics such as ethnicity, race, religion, and {{socioeconomic}} status play a role in how someone chooses their spouse. Socioeconomic status can be defined as an individual’s income, level of education, and occupation. Research on socioeconomic status of <b>homogamy</b> was developed by stratification researchers who used marriage patterns in conjunction with mobility patterns to describe how open stratification systems are. (Kalmijn, 2). Socioeconomic status can be divided into two studies: ascribed status and achieved status. Ascribed status simply means the occupational class of the father or father in law while achieved status is one’s education and occupation. Ascribed status has become less important while achieved status and education have not lost their importance.|$|E
5000|$|Social <b>homogamy</b> {{refers to}} [...] "passive, {{indirect}} effects on spousal similarity" [...] (Watson et al., 2004, p. 1034). The result showed that age and education level are crucial in affecting the mate preference. Because people with similar age study and interact {{more in the}} same form of the school, propinquity effect (i.e., the tendency of people to meet and spend time with those who share the common characteristics) plays a significant impact in spousal similarity. Convergence refers to an increasing similarity with time. Although the previous research showed {{that there is a}} greater effect on attitude and value than on personality traits, however, it is found that initial assortment (i.e., similarity within couples at the beginning of marriage) rather than convergence, plays a crucial role in explaining spousal similarity.|$|E
50|$|Assortative mating is a {{mating pattern}} and {{a form of}} sexual {{selection}} in which individuals with similar phenotypes mate with one another more frequently than would be expected under a random mating pattern. Examples of similar phenotypes include, {{but are not limited}} to, body size, skin coloration/pigmentation, and age. Assortative mating, also referred to as positive assortative mating or <b>homogamy,</b> may increase genetic relatedness within the family. Assortative mating can be contrasted with disassortative mating (also known as negative assortative mating or heterogamy) in which individuals with dissimilar genotypes and/or phenotypes mate with one another more frequently than would be expected under random mating. Disassortative mating reduces the genetic similarities within the family. Positive assortative mating occurs more frequently than negative assortative mating. In both cases, due to the nonrandom mating pattern, there is a deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg principle (which states that genotype frequencies in a population will remain constant from generation to generation in the absence of other evolutionary influences).|$|E
5000|$|Winch {{found that}} people tend to {{associate}} with and to marry among persons similar to themselves, {{but that it is}} also thought to be desirable and right for one to marry [...] "among one's own" [...] in regard to race, religion, etc. He also argued that there is a set of variables which <b>homogamy</b> has been shown to function: race, religion, social class, broad occupational grouping, location of residence, income, age, level of education, intelligence, etc. With these variables, he says, the sort of people with whom we shall most likely interact with are chosen and in turn, they define a [...] "field of eligible spouse-candidates". These 'spouse-candidates' are not just people within in close proximity to us, but rather, people who we pass on a day-to-day basis because of our routine and may have never even noticed. In other words, someone's spouse may end up being the man sitting behind them in church every Sunday, or the woman they are running next to at the gym.|$|E
5000|$|People {{are drawn}} to someone with the similar {{lifestyle}} and standard of living. These people have a higher chance of common personal tastes, opinions and values with one another, {{making it easier to}} establish affinitive relations. These aspects can be assimilated through the different social networks. Contrary to some belief, the idea that having a common profession is not the strongest bond of compatibility; educational homophily has a trend that confirms cultural differences and similarities are stronger than occupational stratification. This is basically saying that even if working in proximity with someone in a similar work force is does not necessarily lead to a stronger bond than having educational similarities. Some of this leads back to the similarities between cultures and education; in education there is a separation of the larger peer group into smaller peer groups that share common economic status, subject of study, and/or backgrounds. This allows <b>homogamy</b> between these subgroups of peers and thus creating smaller groups that share two or more similarities. This example of status and educational culture reflects how people meet in the world through social networks.|$|E
40|$|Research in {{assortative mating}} in {{developing}} countries focused mainly on the cultural similarities of individuals till the most recent times. Educational <b>homogamy</b> was not considered a significant factor. This study examined the changes in educational <b>homogamy</b> of 39, 257 ever-married couples in India for the three marriage cohorts 1964 – 1984, 1985 – 1995, and 1996 – 2006 by place of residence, religion, and economic background. The study also examined the regional pattern of educational <b>homogamy</b> based on female literacy and the probability of educational <b>homogamy</b> after adjusting for socioeconomic background of the respondent. Data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS- 3) {{was used for the}} study. The study observed significant increase in educational <b>homogamy</b> for the successive marriage cohorts. <b>Homogamy</b> is concentrated at the extremes of the educational attainment. In urban areas, <b>homogamy</b> is concentrated among the higher educated individuals whereas, in rural areas, <b>homogamy</b> is high among uneducated individuals. The results also depict regions with higher female literacy having the highest educational <b>homogamy</b> and vice versa. The study also found an increase in the probability of <b>homogamy</b> and a decline in hypogamy for literate women, after accounting for socioeconomic confounders...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} husbands' and wives' party {{political}} identifications in combination. There {{is a high}} level of party political <b>homogamy</b> in Great Britain (i. e. spouses tend to share the same party political identification). Statistical analyses show that levels of <b>homogamy</b> vary according to strength of party political identification, parental <b>homogamy,</b> age, and marital status. Levels of party political similarity are also shown to differ between marriage and other social relationships, and between first marriages and remarriages. Attitudes towards <b>homogamy</b> are shown to vary with age. The implications of these findings for theories relating to the origins of <b>homogamy</b> and to the consequences of heterogamy are considered. Broadly speaking, the findings indicate that party political <b>homogamy</b> is a consequence of demographic constraints, utility-maximizing choices, and responses to cultural norms...|$|E

40|$|This paper reviews {{changes in}} <b>homogamy</b> by {{migration}} status and educational level in Monterrey, Mexico, through {{the analysis of}} marriage patterns for two cohorts of men born in 1905 – 1934 and 1940 – 1969. Results show {{a significant increase in}} educational <b>homogamy,</b> as well as in <b>homogamy</b> by rural origins. The changes suggest that education has played an increasingly important role in the process of mate selection, although certain particularistic characteristics, such as being a rural immigrant, are still important in marriage formation. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings for the relationship between <b>homogamy</b> and social stratification. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media B.
