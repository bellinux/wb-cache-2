Some felt the language was too complex; others, too simple.|$|E
5|$|The initial premise {{placed the}} story on a space station to avoid the {{ecological}} damage that the creatures would have on a planet. However, Gerrold's agent was concerned that requiring a miniature of the station to be built {{as well as the}} additional sets would cause it to be too expensive for a single episode. Because of his agent's comments, Gerrold modified the pitch to place the action on a colony planet instead. This pitch included the plot points such as the creatures getting into a poisoned grain storage, but omitted the Klingons; and Cyrano Jones was called Cyrano Smith. The five pitches were submitted by Gerrold's agent in February 1967, and received a response in June. At the time the show had already purchased too many scripts for the second season but story editor D. C. Fontana suggested that they should purchase the story and assign it to a staff writer as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> some of the other stories they already had.|$|E

25|$|Within the army, {{organisation}} {{and theory}} had no obvious link with war planning and responsibilities overlapped. The General Staff devised deployment plans and its chief became de facto Commander-in-Chief if war began but in peace, command was vested in the commanders of the twenty army corps districts. These commanders were {{independent of the}} General Staff Chief and trained soldiers {{according to their own}} devices. The German system of government was federal and the ministries of war of the constituent states controlled the forming and equipping of units, command and promotions. The system was inherently competitive and became more so after the Waldersee period, when the possibility increased of another Volkskrieg, a war of the nation in arms, rather than the few European wars fought by small professional armies, that had occurred after 1815. Schlieffen concentrated on matters he could influence and pressed for increases {{in the size of the}} army and the adoption of new weapons. A big army would create more choices about how to fight a war and better weapons would make the army more formidable. Mobile heavy artillery could help make up for numerical inferiority against a Franco-Russian coalition and smash fortifications. Schlieffen tried to make the army more operationally capable so that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> its potential enemies and rapidly could win a decisive victory.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{also spoke}} about O'Neal in 2001 with Rabbi Shmuley. He {{described}} holding hands with her: [...] "I was, like, in heaven.

[...] He recalled one of the times they held hands:I remember we went to this club, and I don't go to clubs, which was called the Roxy. And I was watching the band, I was sitting there, and underneath the table, she was holding my hand, and I was, like melting. [...] Fireworks going off. It was all I needed. But that means nothing to kids today. She grew up too fast. She wasn't into innocence, and I love that.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to ? was favourable. Indah Setiawati of The Jakarta Post {{wrote that the}} film was a [...] "gallant attempt to promoted [...] moderate Islam and reveal the sensitive issues {{in the country in}} a casual way", and that viewers should [...] "get ready to burst into laughter and break down in tears". Aguslia, writing for Tempo, said that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> the 2010 Citra Award winner 3 Hati Dua Dunia, Satu Cinta, which had similar themes. Kartoyo DS, reviewing for Suara Karya after a press screening, praised the plot, visuals, and music.|$|E
500|$|PopMatters' Kevin Wong {{gave the}} episode a {{positive}} review, feeling <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> {{the two previous}} episodes of the season. He commented on the fight scene between Peter and Ernie the Giant Chicken as [...] "a cartoon action sequence to end all cartoon action sequences: vehicles explode and limbs flail as Peter and the chicken beat each other senseless." [...] "Blind Ambition" [...] was criticized by Mike Drucker of IGN, who found that [...] "the long fight with the chicken in Blind Ambition was funny once before, but borderline tiring here". However, Drucker {{also noted that the}} Star Wars ending was [...] "one of my favorite jokes in the series".|$|E
500|$|The King and I {{opened on}} Broadway on March 29, 1951, {{with a wide}} {{expectation}} of a hit by the press and public. [...] Both Hammerstein and Rodgers professed to be worried. [...] The composer complained that most people were not concerned about whether the show was good, but whether <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> South Pacific. [...] Even the weather cooperated: heavy rain in New York stopped in time to allow the mostly wealthy or connected opening night audience to arrive dry at the St. James Theatre.

500|$|... "The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Carlos Delgado of iF Magazine {{called the}} episode a potential classic and a [...] "phenomenal follow up showing" [...] {{to the season}} premiere [...] "Sexual Healing", {{which he did not}} enjoy. Delgado said the script was intelligent and praised the theme of over-analyzing art. He also praised the vomiting jokes, and said he could not remember the last time he laughed so hard during a South Park episode. Entertainment Weekly television columnist Ken Tucker said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> the season premiere, which he also praised. Tucker particularly enjoyed the satire of pop culture criticism, and wrote, [...] "I'd compare the Scrotie episode to the work of Rabelais, Henry Miller, and Dennis Cooper, but then I'd be part of the boys' satire, wouldn't I?" ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{has been}} {{referred}} to as an [...] "indecent behavior anthem" [...] due to its lyrical content. Ken Capobianco of the Boston Globe said that [...] "Say Aah" [...] was one of the [...] "popping tracks" [...] which parent album Ready was built around. Commenting on the song's lyrics, Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy stated that, [...] "Its over-abundance of hooks ('we don't buyyyy no drinks at the bar' being a personal favorite) makes it pretty hard to dislike. And the verse from Brooklyn's Fabolous will bring in even the most hardened of fun-haters." [...] Vibe called the song [...] "the official birthday song of the year", claiming that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> Jeremih's [...] "Birthday Sex". The song was nominated for [...] "Viewers' Choice" [...] and [...] "Best Collaboration" [...] at the 2010 BET Awards.|$|E
500|$|Sean Dooley of About.com labeled [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] {{as one of}} the [...] "best {{songs on}} Fearless", while Johnny Davis of The Observer {{believed}} some parts of the song [...] "may needle British ears", although he felt that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> single releases by pop singer Hilary Duff. Lucy Davies of the BBC was not impressed by the song's theme being similar to those of other songs on Fearless or on her eponymous debut album, Taylor Swift. She opined that [...] "You Belong with Me"'s [...] "lyrical palette has few colours [...] and it's repetitive". Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine said, [...] "'You Belong with Me' isn't her best-written song by a long shot, but it's hard to fault its construction." [...] Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone commented, [...] "It's hard not to be won over by the guilelessness".|$|E

500|$|Both songs {{garnered}} {{critical acclaim}} from most music critics. An editor of CD Journal enjoyed its production, calling it [...] "impressive". The reviewer {{went on to}} praise the composition, describing the sound as a [...] "fantastic atmosphere". To conclude the review, it described her vocals as [...] "beautiful". A reviewer from Channel-Ai awarded [...] "Passion" [...] four-and-a-half stars out of five, but favored the track over [...] "Sanctuary". For future releases, the reviewer also recommended Utada's Japanese counterparts over English dubs. Lex from VGMO.com awarded it eight stars, commending the production and sound. However, she agreed that she found [...] "Passion" [...] more satisfying than its English version. Writing from the same publication, Harry Simons enjoyed the single and felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> the singers previous theme song [...] "Hikari", but expressed that the [...] "After the Battle" [...] version should have been served as the single.|$|E
500|$|From {{contemporary}} reviews, Howard Thompson of The New York Times gave a brief negative {{review of}} Danger: Diabolik {{referring to the}} film as [...] "infantile junk." [...] Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film a {{two and a half}} star rating out of four, stating that he felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> the other Dino De Laurentiis production Barbarella, but that it was [...] "long and eventually loses track of itself." [...] Variety gave the film a negative review, calling it a [...] "dull Dino De Laurentiis programmer" [...] whose [...] "izarre sets, poor process work, static writing and limp direction spell pure formula fare for lowercase grind bookings." [...] The Monthly Film Bulletin gave the film a positive review, noting that: [...] "Bava's superb visual sense stands him in good stead in this comic-strip adventure which looks like a brilliant pastiche of the best of everything in anything from James Bond to Matt Helm." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Ratner, Myers was not {{comfortable}} with these scenes, as {{he felt it was}} too sexual and inappropriate; he even asked him to cut that particular shot. Madonna on the other hand, thought it was fun and convinced the director to keep it. The video ends with one of Powers' fantasies, him proclaiming [...] "It's good to be me!" [...] as Madonna playfully strokes his cheek. Author Georges Claude Guilbert wrote in his book, Madonna as Postmodern Myth, that [...] "Beautiful Stranger" [...] denoted one of the series of looks reinvented by Madonna around that time, and was a [...] "radical" [...] change from the geisha look of her previous video for [...] "Nothing Really Matters", released the same year. Matthew Rettenmund wrote in his Encyclopedia Madonnica that [...] "Madonna probably gave very little thought [...] " [...] but he felt that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> being a [...] "couple of steps above a clips compilation".|$|E

500|$|Campling {{and other}} critics have commented {{that one of the}} main {{features}} of the show is the ability of the locals to laugh at themselves and their eccentricities. Campling wrote of the Skipton show: [...] "The ability to laugh at itself is one of this country's finest attributes, but the Skipton mob were only too happy to celebrate their insularity." [...] Elisabeth Mahoney of The Guardian, who reviewed the Dartford episode, said: [...] "Going to a place and insulting it takes guts and careful strategies. Steel made use {{of the fact that he}} is from nearby Swanley, both to signal that he knows the area but also that – whatever he was about to say about Dartford – <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> his hometown." [...] Another journalist, reviewing the Penzance episode in the North Devon Journal commented: [...] "Why do we like programmes that laugh at us? Because, I hope, we laugh at ourselves. We're not ignorant of our stereotypes. West Cornwall? Aaarrrrr!" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{recording}} sessions {{ran from}} January to March 2005, {{with only two}} and a half weeks being spent on the acoustic record. Forty tracks were recorded – fifteen of them acoustic – with half of them ending on the final track list. Studio 606 was not finished as the band moved in, and the bandmembers even helped with the final stages of construction, [...] "hammering, stuffing insulation — doing whatever to speed the process." [...] Eight of the rock songs were last-minute compositions done after the acoustic record was finished, as [...] "Dave started feeling that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> the rock record." [...] The songs were recorded on analog tape—which was reused over and over due to a tape shortage and a desire to save money—before being transferred to Pro Tools for overdubs, editing and mixing. Raskulinecz mixed the rock songs, while Elliot Scheiner mixed the stereo and 5.1 versions of the acoustic sides.|$|E
500|$|The {{subsequent}} {{versions of}} Final Fantasy have garnered mostly favorable reviews from the media. Peer Schneider of IGN enjoyed the WonderSwan Color version, praising its graphical improvements, especially the environments, characters, and monsters. Famitsu scored this version a 30 out of 40. Final Fantasy Origins was generally well-received; GamePro said {{the music was}} [...] "fantastic", and that the graphics had a [...] "suitably retro cuteness to them." [...] Reviews for [...] were generally positive, with Jeremy Dunham of IGN giving particular praise to the improved English translation, saying <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> any previous version of the game. The PlayStation Portable version was not as critically successful as the previous releases; GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd cited the visuals as its strongest enhancement but stated that the additional random enemy encounters and updated graphics did not add much value. The Dawn of Souls package was rated 76th in Nintendo Powers Top 200 Games list.|$|E
