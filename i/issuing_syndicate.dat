50|$|The Jumbo Pfandbrief, {{first brought}} to market in 1995, arose from {{a need to}} attract {{international}} investors to a market that had been largely of domestic interest. Instead of individual banks placing large-volume issues, the Jumbo Pfandbrief allows an <b>issuing</b> <b>syndicate</b> {{with the goal of}} marketing Jumbo Pfandbrief issues and of subsequently ensuring market making. A Jumbo Pfandbrief must have a minimum issuance volume of EUR 1 billion. The average issue size of a Jumbo Pfandbrief is about EUR 1.5 billion. A minimum of five market makers is required. Jumbo Pfandbriefe must be listed on the German stock exchange. Total Jumbo covered bonds first-time sales amounted to EUR 161.3 billion in 2007. In 2007, the four biggest jumbo covered bond-issuing countries were France (24.7%), Spain (22.3%), Germany (20%), and the UK (10.7%).|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates {{stock market}} {{reaction}} to debt arrangements in Russia. The {{analysis of the}} valuation of debt arrangements by stock markets provides information {{about the use of}} debt by Russian companies. We apply the event study methodology to check whether debt announcements lead to abnormal returns using a sample of Russian listed companies that <b>issued</b> <b>syndicated</b> loans or bonds between June 2004 and December 2008. We find a negative reaction of stock markets to debt arrangements that can be explained by moral hazard behavior of shareholders at the expense of debtholders. Further, we observe no significant difference between announcements of syndicated loans and bonds. Thus, our findings support the view that Russian companies could have incentives to limit their reliance on external debt.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} loan and syndicate characteristics and information disclosure and legal environment factors on the arrangement timetable of bank loan syndications (measured as the time elapsed from the launching until {{the completion of the}} deal) from 68 countries over the 1992 - 2006 period. Employing accelerated failure time models from survival analysis methodology, we find that loan, syndicate, legal environment and information disclosure characteristics which reduce agency problems related to syndication reduce the arrangement timetable. Among the country level characteristics, information disclosure which reduces moral hazard due to informational frictions between syndicate members appears {{to be the most important}} driver of a faster deal arrangement timetable, while better creditor rights protection increase the arrangement timetable, consistently with recontracting risk <b>issues.</b> <b>Syndicated</b> loans arrangement timetable, Agency problems, Information disclosure, Legal risk, Survival analysis, Accelerated failure time models. ...|$|R

40|$|The rapid {{development}} of structured credit markets permits investors to assume credit risk that in aggregate is frequently many {{times larger than}} the amount of debt actually issued by an underlying borrower. Given the apparent increased appetite for corporate credit risk by investors, and the additional information revealed in the structured credit markets, a natural question to ask is whether the development of these markets has been associated with a reduction in the cost of debt financing, giving firms an opportunity to operate with greater leverage. Using Markit data identifying when trading in credit default swaps begins for each borrower, we fail to find any evidence of that CDS trading has an impact on syndicated loan spreads or non-price terms for the average firm. However, we document evidence that CDS trading helps borrowers <b>issue</b> <b>syndicated</b> loans more frequently and take on more leverage relative to a matched sample of untraded firms, consistent with an increase in credit supply.

50|$|Another <b>issue</b> in <b>syndicating</b> {{a reality}} series is licensing; shows that {{rely heavily on}} music, a format popular in the late 2000s and early 2010s, require that the music used in the show be licensed, which discourages the rerunning of the show.

40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to examine the}} role of adverse {{selection}} costs in times of high debt issue volume, or the hot debt market. Following the pecking order theory of capital structure, I hypothesize that high information asymmetry between investors and managers hinders companies from issuing equity and, instead, prompts firms to time their debt issues to that point of time. I also examine whether the phenomenon is more pronounced for the private debt market and whether evidence of timing attempt {{can be found in the}} issue size and use of proceeds of hot debt issues. DATA The empirical analysis conducted in this study is based on comprehensive data of debt issues by listed non-financial companies in the U. S. market in 1999 - 2009. The data are collected from SDC Platinum. The final sample of debt issues consists of 1, 527 public debt issues, 814 private debt issues and 4, 408 <b>issues</b> of <b>syndicated</b> loans. I also utilize Thomson ONE Banker for issuers’ financial and stock price data, I/B/E/S for analyst forecast data and DataStream for macroeconomic variables. RESULTS The results from the empirical analysis, based on ordinary least squares regressions method, lead to a conclusion that, in aggregate, adverse selection costs are one factor behind the hot debt market. I also find that the three examined debt markets have behaved in a remarkably divergent way, and while high adverse selection costs are found to drive the debt <b>issue</b> waves of <b>syndicated</b> loans, information asymmetry appears to reduce private debt issuance. Based on larger issue size and changes in balance sheet items of hot debt issuers, I conclude that the behavior of hot debt issuers shows some evidence of market timing. However, the impact of adverse selection costs in issue size and use of proceeds is varying and in many cases statistically weak...|$|R

50|$|Since {{the dawn}} of comic strips, the {{ownership}} of them has been a recurrent <b>issue.</b> Traditionally, the <b>syndicate</b> owned {{the rights to the}} strips. However, throughout history there have been exceptions, with Mutt and Jeff being an early (if not the earliest) case in which the creator owned his works. However this was later limited to adaptations of animated properties. When it started in 1970, the Universal Press Syndicate gave cartoonists a 50-percent share on the ownership of their works, while the Creators Syndicate (founded in 1987) granted artists full rights to the strips, something that Universal Press did in 1990. followed by King Features in 1995, while before 1999 both the Tribune and United Feature services began granting rights to creators over their works; however the latter three syndicates only applied this to new strips, or to ones popular enough.|$|R

Though there were no public clashes between Pascual and the board in 1966-1968, key Traditionalist pundits used to challenge Pascual’s line from the very onset. In the late 1960s he was already considered one of three [...] "prohombres del neocarlismo socialista", who presided over transformation towards Marxism. Following printing of declaration <b>issued</b> by Catholic <b>syndicates,</b> which in name of [...] "the working class" [...] lambasted [...] "unjust and inhuman capitalist system", {{in the spring of}} 1970 Pascual was officially admonished by the managing board; in July that year Editorial Navarra terminated Pascual’s employment contract.|$|R

5000|$|Depending on the station, morning drive {{can start}} {{as early as}} 5 a.m. local time, {{although}} rarely any earlier. Because the contiguous United States spans four time zones, what constitutes drive time on one coast does not broadcast in drive time on the other, which can cause <b>issues</b> for nationally <b>syndicated</b> programs; this is not {{as much of an}} issue in morning drive, which usually incorporates a tape delay to air {{at the same time in}} all time zones, as it is for afternoon drive. However this effectively means that morning shows are heavily New York or East Coast-centric to allow time-shifting in all time zones, with some Central Time Zone shows making some additional headway. For all intents and purposes though, morning shows originating west of the Rockies must additionally plan to be mid-morning offerings for the rest of the country and adjust accordingly to be office-appropriate for those stations which take the shows in the east. National satellite networks typically air their morning drive programs from 6-11 a.m. Eastern Time, with heavy repetition.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the period}} from 1996 to 2010, {{competition}} to provide corporate and institutional banking services in Australia substantially increased, {{with a large number}} of international banks entering the domestic market. This development is consistent with the long standing desire of policy makers to increase competition within the banking system, rather than a focus on introducing alternative sources of competition, such as a corporate bond market. Nevertheless, the four major Australian banks have tended to dominate the lead arranger league tables for arranging both non-government bonds <b>issues</b> and <b>syndicated</b> banking facilities. The influx of international banks into the domestic market over the period provoked a competitive response from the incumbent banks by increasing their relationship banking activities. This involved increased relationship lending, in the form of syndicated loans to the corporate sector and ensuring a steady supply of high quality non-government bonds to institutional investor clients. As a result, Australia has a developed and liquid non-government bond market but corporate issuers have been limited. This thesis finds that competition to provide syndicated loans has relied on borrower perception of a competitively priced product and providing large amounts of debt, without the need for the borrower to have a credit rating, to attract a clientele. This finding is contrary to theoretical predictions that company financial characteristics will determine a choice between the borrowing from a bank or issuing a bond. Competition in the syndicated loan market has inhibited the development of the Australian corporate bond market even though the cost of debt is found on average to be lower in the corporate bond market. It is found that the major banks achieved dominance of the syndicated loan market through operational efficiency that allowed credit spreads on syndicated loans to be reduced. However, syndicated loans were not priced as loss leaders and evidence is found of bank-reliant borrowers being held-up by their syndicated lenders. Overall, a symbiotic relationship appears to exist between banks and the debt market in Australia, in which the behaviours of competition, complementarity and co-evolution are exhibited. To develop the corporate bond market the challenge is to attract companies; to position the market as viable source of term debt funding, just as the larger non-government bond market is. It is recommended that companies actively seek alternative term debt funding options or at least improve their bargaining position by holding a credit rating. It is also recommended that policy makers encourage competitive alternatives to the banking system for the provision of term debt funding to large Australian companies. A competitive advantage of well-developed corporate bond markets is the ability to provide longer term funding than that provided by the banking system. Accordingly, it is recommended that the risk free yield curve be extended beyond the current 15 years to promote longer term corporate bond issuance...|$|R
