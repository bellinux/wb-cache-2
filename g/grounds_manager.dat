50|$|Granny’s Garden School is {{the brainchild}} of Roberta “Granny” Paolo, who was {{inspired}} by the positive experiences she had working with her own grandchildren in her backyard garden. One fall day in 2001, while picking her grandchildren up from school, she noticed someone planting flowers {{in the front of the}} school. It was then that she realized that school could be the perfect place for children to interact with gardens.After meeting with school administrators and the <b>grounds</b> <b>manager,</b> Paolo presented her idea for the school garden to the Loveland School Board.The Loveland School Garden Program launched that spring. In addition to the adult volunteers, students contributed by spending some of their physical education hours in preparing beds and planting flowers. Over the course of the spring and summer, Paolo worked to create more garden activities and teachers would sign up to participate. By the fall of 2002 there were seventeen individual classroom gardens. Over the course of the next few years, Granny’s Garden School continued to expand and develop comprehensive lesson plans and train instructors for the students. Today there are over one hundred garden beds that serve over fifty classrooms at Loveland Elementary School.|$|E

25|$|By the mid 1960s, Fitzroy's {{traditional}} home ground, the Brunswick Street Oval {{was in a}} {{state of}} disrepair. However, the <b>ground</b> <b>managers</b> were the Fitzroy Cricket Club.

The Fitzroy City Council, despite repeated requests from the Football Club, also refused to help, even rejecting the idea of a $400,000 loan to Fitzroy Football Club, and a 40-year lease of the ground so they could make some repairs.|$|R
50|$|The {{ground was}} most notable {{as the home}} of the Yarraville Football Club {{throughout}} almost its entire existence in both the Victorian Junior Football Association from 1903 until 1927, and then in the Victorian Football Association from 1928 until 1982; the club played its games at the Western Oval in its final season in 1983. The ground was originally managed by a group of trustees, but management of the ground was transferred to the Footscray Council in 1928 to enable the ground to be upgraded to Association standards. The City of Maribyrnong, which incorporates the former City of Footscray, remains the <b>ground</b> <b>manager.</b>|$|R

The research is complementary {{to the findings of}} previous research which identified a potential 'skills time bomb' among sports grounds staff at the beginning of 2008. The main aim {{of the study was to}} identify attitudes of senior management to grounds staff and the perceptions they have of actual and potential skills shortages and skills gaps in the industry. The study also investigated senior management views on the utilisation of grounds staff in the future. The methods employed included an online survey, completed by 124 senior managers, and 20 semi-structured interviews with both <b>grounds</b> <b>managers</b> and senior managers within the industry...|$|R
50|$|The Preston Football Club also faced a {{potential}} grounds-related {{threat to its}} viability during the 1961/62 offseason. The VFL's Fitzroy Football Club was on poor terms with the Fitzroy Cricket Club, co-tenants and <b>ground</b> <b>managers</b> of the Brunswick Street Oval. The Fitzroy Football Club decided that it wanted to move to Preston, and after some preliminary but unsuccessful negotiations with the Preston Football Club, it made a request directly to the Preston Council for a 40-year lease of the Preston Football Ground, starting {{from the end of}} 1962. The Preston Council decided that the lease could be granted only if the two football clubs came to agreeable terms, and the Preston Football Club insisted that Fitzroy would need to rebrand itself as Preston if it made the move. The two football clubs did not come to an agreement, and Fitzroy remained at the Brunswick Street Oval.|$|R

Rather than discuss structure in detail I want to turn my attention to the roles we find in software development groups. However, before I do so I want use this article to offer some warnings. Management isn’t homogenous How does one define management? Or rather, how does one know management work when we see it? Perhaps in years gone by management work could be defined as that which was not manual labour.
