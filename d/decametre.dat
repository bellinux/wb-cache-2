40|$|Abstract Large scale {{metrology}} {{refers to}} dimensional measurement of objects or features of perhaps a ten of meters {{or more in}} size. Alternatively, large scale metrology {{could be said to}} apply to any dimensional measurement where the metrology instrument has to be brought to the object rather than vice versa. Recent approaches seem to turn their attention towards distributed metrology systems made of multiple components with small dimensions spread around the measuring area. In general, these components are able to form a wireless network of sensors that allows rapid dimensional measurements to be performed in relation to large-size objects, with typical dimensions of several <b>decametres.</b> The portability, flexibility, and ease of installation of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) make these systems attractive for many industries manufacturing large scale products.

40|$|Advances in {{the area}} of {{industrial}} metrology have generated new technologies that are capable of measuring components with complex geometry and large dimensions. However, no standard or best-practice guides are available for the majority of such systems. Therefore, these new systems require appropriate testing and verification in order for the users to understand their full potential prior to their deployment in a real manufacturing environment. This is a crucial stage, especially when more than one system can be used for a specific measurement task. In this paper, two relatively new large-volume measurement systems, the mobile spatial co-ordinate measuring system (MScMS) and the indoor global positioning system (iGPS), are reviewed. These two systems utilize different technologies: the MScMS is based on ultrasound and radiofrequency signal transmission and the iGPS uses laser technology. Both systems have components with small dimensions that are distributed around the measuring area to form a network of sensors allowing rapid dimensional measurements to be performed in relation to large-size objects, with typical dimensions of several <b>decametres.</b> The portability, reconfigurability, and ease of installation make these systems attractive for many industries that manufacture large-scale products. In this paper, the major technical aspects of the two systems are briefly described and compared.

40|$|The ultramafic amphibolites hosted in the Hercynian {{migmatite}} of NE Sardinia {{consist of}} three main compositional layers (A, B, C) {{from a few}} metres to a few <b>decametres</b> thick. Layer A {{is made up of}} coarse-grained olivine, chlorite, amphibole, spinel, minor pyroxene, garnet and, rarely, plagioclase. Layer B is made up of coarse-grained plagioclase, olivine, pyroxene, spinel, garnet and amphibole. Layer C consists mainly of porphyroblastic garnet, pyroxene, large amphibole grains (up to 5 cm) and minor plagioclase. On the basis of mineral assemblages and microstructures, three stages of mineralogical re-equilibration can be recognised: granulite, amphibolite and greenschist. Primary igneous olivine and anorthite reacted under granulite conditions to produce coronas consisting of orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, green spinel and garnet. The amphibolite stage is characterised by the formation of brown and green clinoamphiboles (between pyroxene and corona garnet), anthophyllite, talc, Mg-rich chlorite, plagioclase and Cr-bearing spinel. Greenschist stage minerals, mostly replacing the mafic minerals, consist of tremolite, fayalite, epidote, albite, calcite, dolomite and serpentine. The history of the ultramafic amphibolites started with igneous crystallisation and continued through granulite (T = 700 – 740 jC, P=f 8 – 10 kbar), amphibolite (T = 580 – 640 jC, P= 4 – 6 kbar) and greenschist facies (T =f 330 – 400 jC, P < 2 – 3 kbar). Evaluation of P–T conditions indicated a P–T path from the protolith to granulite stage, characterised by an increase in pressure and temperature, and then from the granulite facies through amphibolite to the greenschist stage, characterised by a decrease in pressure and temperature. The petrological evolution of the ultramafic amphibolites and the P–T time path is discussed {{in the context of the}} Hercynian orogeny in Sardinia...|$|R

40|$|At the {{mid-latitudes}} of Utopia Planitia (UP), Mars, a {{suite of}} spatially-associated landforms exhibit geomorphological traits that, on Earth, {{would be consistent with}} periglacial processes and the possible freeze-thaw cycling of water. The suite comprises small-sized polygonally-patterned ground, polygon-junction and -margin pits, and scalloped, rimless depressions. Typically, the landforms incise a dark-toned terrain that is thought to be ice-rich. Here, we investigate the dark-toned terrain by using high resolution images from the HiRISE as well as near-infrared spectral-data from the OMEGA and CRISM. The terrain displays erosional characteristics consistent with a sedimentary nature and near-infrared spectra characterised by a blue slope similar to that of weathered basaltic-tephra. We also describe volcanic terrain that is dark-toned and periglacially-modified in the Kamchatka mountain-range of eastern Russia. The terrain is characterised by weathered tephra inter-bedded with snow, ice-wedge polygons and near-surface excess ice. The excess ice forms in the pore space of the tephra as the result of snow-melt infiltration and, subsequently, in-situ freezing. Based on this possible analogue, we construct a three-stage mechanism that explains the possible ice-enrichment of a broad expanse of dark-toned terrain at the mid-latitudes of UP: (1) the dark-toned terrain accumulates and forms via the regional deposition of sediments sourced from explosive volcanism; (2) the volcanic sediments are blanketed by atmospherically-precipitated (H 2 O) snow, ice or an admixture of the two, either concurrent with the volcanic-events or between discrete events; and, (3) under the influence of high obliquity or explosive volcanism, boundary conditions tolerant of thaw evolve and this, in turn, permits the migration, cycling and eventual formation of excess ice in the volcanic sediments. Over time, and through episodic iterations of this scenario, excess ice forms to <b>decametres</b> of depth. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Injection {{of fluids}} into deep saline {{aquifers}} causes a pore pressure {{increase in the}} storage formation, and thus displacement of resident brine. Via hydraulically conductive faults, brine may migrate upwards into shallower aquifers and lead to unwanted salinisation of potable groundwater resources. In the present study, we investigated different scenarios for a potential storage site in the Northeast German Basin using a three-dimensional (3 -D)  regional-scale model that includes four major fault zones. The focus was on assessing the impact of fault length {{and the effect of}} a secondary reservoir above the storage formation, as well as model boundary conditions and initial salinity distribution on the potential salinisation of shallow groundwater resources. We employed numerical simulations of brine injection as a representative fluid. Our simulation results demonstrate that the lateral model boundary settings and the effective fault damage zone volume have the greatest influence on pressure build-up and development within the reservoir, and thus intensity and duration of fluid flow through the faults. Higher vertical pressure gradients for short fault segments or a small effective fault damage zone volume result in the highest salinisation potential due to a larger vertical fault height affected by fluid displacement. Consequently, it has a strong impact on the degree of shallow aquifer salinisation, whether a gradient in salinity exists or the saltwater–freshwater interface lies below the fluid displacement depth in the faults. A small effective fault damage zone volume or low fault permeability further extend the duration of fluid flow, which can persist for several tens to hundreds of years, if the reservoir is laterally confined. Laterally open reservoir boundaries, large effective fault damage zone volumes and intermediate reservoirs significantly reduce vertical brine migration and the potential of freshwater salinisation because the origin depth of displaced brine is located only a few <b>decametres</b> below the shallow aquifer in maximum. The present study demonstrates that the existence of hydraulically conductive faults is not necessarily an exclusion criterion for potential injection sites, because salinisation of shallower aquifers strongly depends on initial salinity distribution, location of hydraulically conductive faults and their effective damage zone volumes as well as geological boundary conditions...|$|R
40|$|This work {{refers to}} an {{extended}} sector of Adriatic Central Italy. It is widely representative of {{a good part of}} the remaining peninsular territory, articulated in two fundamental systems: the mountainous system of the Umbria-Marche Apennine, made up prevalently of limestone structured in east verging folds and thrusts, and the second hilly-coastal system made up mainly of marly clays interspersed with sands and conglomerates structured in a monoclinal setting which ends in a narrow anticline along the Adriatic Coast. The structural setting is a consequence of the Pliocene compressive tectonics and its late effects, still active on the coast, and of an extensive tectonic phase which was activated starting in the early Pleistocene, to which a generalised and intense uplifting is associated. The genesis of high fault slopes and thrust fronts and the deep incision of the hydrographic network, to which high relief is connected, are associated to the latter. Analysed and interpreted are the mass movements which characterise the fundamental physiographic units that make up the systems, whose action (past and present) assumes a fundamental role in the evolution of the physical landscape of the area since it re-modelled a great part of the valley incisions. Huge landslides and deep seated gravitational slope deformations characterise both the tectonic slopes and the transversal valleys of the chain. They affect, besides, the bedrock for a thickness of from a few <b>decametres</b> to a hundred metres and more and are frequent also along the coastal cliffs. Such great gravitational phenomena are less frequent in the hilly unit, but have a great importance there since they often affect villages which originated in the Medieval Ages. In this latter unit, besides, specific mass movements of the clayey bedrock and of the mainly silty-clayey eluvialcolluvial coverings are strongly diffused. Through the analysis of typical cases, the predisposing, activating and evolutive control factors are identified or hypothesised. These are mainly identified in the lithostratigraphicstructural, tectonic, and seismic factors; in the hydrogeological setting connected to the intrinsic conditions of permeability of the lithotype and to the Pleistocene-Holocene climate oscillations; in the morphological setting induced by the tectonics-climate interaction; in the slope anthropization and in the related farming activities...|$|R

40|$|Water-conducting faults and {{fractures}} {{were studied}} in the granite-hosted A¨ spo¨ Hard Rock Laboratory (SE Sweden). On a scale of <b>decametres</b> and larger, steeply dipping faults dominate and contain {{a variety of different}} fault rocks (mylonites, cataclasites, fault gouges). On a smaller scale, somewhat less regular fracture patterns were found. Conceptual models of the fault and fracture geometries and of the properties of rock types adjacent to fractures were derived and used as input for the modelling of in situ dipole tracer tests that were conducted in the framework of the Tracer Retention Understanding Experiment (TRUE- 1) on a scale of metres. After the identification of all relevant transport and retardation processes, blind predictions of the breakthroughs of conservative to moderately sorbing tracers were calculated and then compared with the experimental data. This paper provides the geological basis and model calibration, while the predictive and inverse modelling work is the topic of the companion paper [J. Contam. Hydrol. 61 (2003) 175]. The TRUE- 1 experimental volume is highly fractured and contains the same types of fault rocks and alterations as on the decametric scale. The experimental flow field was modelled {{on the basis of a}} 2 D-streamtube formalism with an underlying homogeneous and isotropic transmissivity field. Tracer transport was modelled using the dual porosity medium approach, which is linked to the flow model by the flow porosity. Given the substantial pumping rates in the extraction borehole, the transport domain has a maximum width of a few centimetres only. It is concluded that both the uncertainty with regard to the length of individual fractures and the detailed geometry of the network along the flowpath between injection and extraction boreholes are not critical because flow is largely one-dimensional, whether through a single fracture or a network. Process identification and model calibration were based on a single uranine breakthrough (test PDT 3), which clearly showed that matrix diffusion had to be included in the model even over the short experimental time scales, evidenced by a characteristic shape of the trailing edge of the breakthrough curve. Using the geological information and therefore considering limited matrix diffusion into a thin fault gouge horizon resulted in a good fit to the experiment. On the other hand, fresh granite was found not to interact noticeably with the tracers over the time scales of the experiments. While fracture-filling gouge materials are very efficient in retarding tracers over short periods of time (hours–days), their volume is very small and, with time progressing, retardation will be dominated by altered wall rock and, finally, by fresh granite. In such rocks, both porosity (and therefore the effective diffusion coefficient) and sorption Kds are more than one order of magnitude smaller compared to fault gouge, thus indicating that long-term retardation is expected to occur but to be less pronounced...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that both As and U {{represent}} geogenic trace elements potentially toxic to humans, little information is available on the development of their enrichments in German sediments and their potential impact on groundwater quality, let alone a systematic overview of the country´s natural occurrences. This work aims at characterizing accumulation processes in aquifers actually or potentially affected by elevated concentrations of As and/or U, and their timings in geological history. The five selected study areas provide different geological and stratigraphical backgrounds. Identification of As and U sources, and structural derivation of their environmental reservoirs as well as remobilization mechanisms potentially resulting in trace element release to groundwater were assessed. Drinking water supply in Franconia/Northern Bavaria is dependent on groundwater extraction from terrestrial Upper Triassic sandstones where elevated concentrations of geogenic U and As exceeding German drinking water limitations were identified. Characterization of aquifer material in terms of geochemical and mineralogical composition, trace elements distribution on a microscale and their mineralogical fractionation and mobilization behaviour showed that uraniferous francolite/hematite inclusions within the aquifer sandstones (“active arkoses”) represent important sources for U and As in the study area. Francolite exhibits biologically, structurally and radiation-enhanced solubility; loss of both U and As during weathering was documented. Jurassic shallow marine Fe ores from the Upper Rhine Graben exhibit significant bulk As hosted in mainly goethite ooids slowly formed in times of condensed sedimentation. The study indicates that As accumulation was favoured over other potential contaminants, esp. heavy metals. Conditions for As accumulation varied during deposition, visible on a macro- (outcrop) as well as on a microscale (single Fe ooid). However, the risk of As release to groundwater of the region is considered rather insignificant. An oxidative terrestrial paleo redox process during the late Tertiary affected Santonian shallow marine sands in the western Münsterland Cretaceous Basin, resulting in a distinct sediment colour and geochemical boundary in several <b>decametres</b> below ground surface, and massive element redistribution. Arsenic resides in pyrite in the reduced section. Its behaviour changes from homogenous sulfide-control in the unaltered sediments to very heterogeneous Fe hydroxide-control above the paleo redox boundary. Early stages of hydroxidic Fe/As accumulations resulting from mobilization from the reduced sediments represent precursors of high-As goethite concretions, widespread in the near-surface oxidized facies. Widespread Oligocene marine sandy sediments from the Lower Rhine Embayment exhibit features of a paleo redox event: primary Fe(II) phases in a reduced facies, hydroxidic Fe mineralogy and significant major and trace element redistribution in near-surface sediments. Striking similarities to the postdepositional redox history of the Cretaceous sediments became obvious, also in terms of As control. Preferential As enrichment over heavy metals in Fe hydroxide concretions was detected. Uranium is rather homogeneously distributed in low concentrations in both redox facies and little affected by the redox event. The reduced deeper sediments are the more probable candidates for creating elevated As in groundwater. Uranium and As in deep groundwater of the volcano-sedimentary basin around San Luis Potosí/north-central Mexico partly exceed drinking water guidelines and thus endanger the most important drinking water source in the area. The As/U hydrogeochemical signatures, their behaviour during rock alteration and evidence from proxies like REE strongly argue for acid volcanic glass dissolution as the dominating process of U and As release to groundwater. The hydrogeochemical fingerprint is modified by additional mobilization from the sedimentary basin filling. Common behaviour of both incompatible elements during magmatic differentiation and growing drift-apart in sedimentary systems are discussed. Besides the importance of the obtained results for the studied regions, geochemical comparison of all study areas offers additional explanations for the large-scale As and U distribution in Germany. While Pleistocene geology explains their absence in sediments and related groundwater in northern Germany, their distribution in the central and southern parts is controlled by provenance geochemistry. Only highly felsic origin (Moldanubian Variscides) enables creation of elevated U in the systems while Rhenohercynian provenance allows for As presence only. Subsequent intrabasinal redistribution contributes to the present-day situation...|$|R
40|$|From introduction: Jupiter is {{the largest}} planet in the solar system. Its {{distance}} from the Sun is five {{times that of the}} Earth and its mass is nearly {{two and a half times}} that of all the other planets added together. Jupiter turns about its own axis rather rapidly, once in just under ten hours, and it completes one revolution about the Sun in just under twelve years. Thus Earth has to pass almost directly between the Sun and Jupiter once every thirteen months. When this happens Jupiter is said to be in "opposition", as its position is then opposite to that of the Sun, when viewed from Earth. Around this time the planet will be most favourably placed for observations, as it is at its closest to Earth and up in the sky for a large part of the night. During the day observations on radio frequencies are more difficult, as the Sun is a source of great interference.

40|$|Plausible {{theories}} of non-thermal radio-noise from Jupiter on decimetre and <b>decametre</b> wavelengths invoke {{a strong and}} nearly dipolar Jovian magnetic field and an associated system of van Allen-type radiation belts of electrically-charged particles extending beyond and interacting with the first Galilean satellite 10.

The apparent absence of a non-thermal component in Saturn’s radio-emission implies that radiation belts cannot form around that planet, possibly because Saturn is non-magnetic, or, more likely, because charged particles {{in the vicinity of}} Saturn are rapidly removed through interactions with the rocky fragments that make up Saturn’s rings.

However, the average profile obtained by combining data from several epochs, at a dispersion measure of 15. 44 pc cm(- 3), is found to be consistent with that from the earlier detection of this pulsar at a confidence level of 99. 2 per cent. We present this consistency between the two profiles as evidence that J 1732 - 3131 is a faint radio pulsar with an average flux density of 200 - 400 mJy at 34 MHz. Despite the extremely bright sky background at such low frequencies, the detection sensitivity of our deep searches is generally comparable to that of higher frequency searches for these pulsars, when scaled using reasonable assumptions about the underlying pulsar spectrum. We provide details of our deep searches, and put stringent upper limits on the decametre-wavelength flux densities of several radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsars...|$|E
40|$|Multi-frequency {{observations}} of E-region coherent backscatter from <b>decametre</b> waves reveal that auroral echoes tend to comprise two spectral components superimposed, one at low Doppler shifts, below 250 ms - 1, {{and the other}} Doppler shifted to near the ion-acoustic speed or above, up to 800 ms - 1. The low Doppler shift component occurs at all look directions; Doppler shifts near the ion acoustic speed occur when looking at low flow angles along {{the direction of the}} electron drift in the electrojet, and Doppler shifts in excess of the ion acoustic speed occur at intermediate flow angles. The latter population appears most commonly at radar frequencies near 10 – 12 MHz, with its occurrence decreasing dramatically at higher frequencies. The velocity of the high Doppler shift echoes increases with increasing radar frequency, or irregularity wave number k. The velocity of the low Doppler shift population appears to be suppressed significantly below the line-of-sight component of the electron drift. Initial estimates of the altitude from which scatter occurs suggest that the high Doppler shift echoes originate from higher in the E-region than the low Doppler shift echoes, certainly in the eastward electrojet. We discuss these observations with reference to the theories of de/stabilization of two-stream waves by electron density gradients and electrostatic ion cyclotron waves excited by field-parallel electron drifts.
