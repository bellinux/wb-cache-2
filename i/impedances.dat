5|$|By 1921 Zobel had further perfected his {{composite}} filter designs. He was now using, in addition, m-type half sections {{at the ends}} of his {{composite filter}}s to improve the impedance matching of the filter to the source and the load, a technique in which he held a patent. The difficulty {{that he was trying to}} overcome was that the image impedance techniques being used to design filter sections only gave the mathematically predicted response if they were terminated in their respective image <b>impedances.</b> Technically, this was easy to do within the filter as it could always be arranged that adjacent filter sections had matching image <b>impedances</b> (one of the characteristics of m-type sections is that one side or the other of the m-type section will have an image impedance identical to the equivalent constant k section). However, the terminating <b>impedances</b> are a different story. These are normally required to be resistive but the image impedance will be complex. Even worse, it is not even mathematically possible to construct a filter image impedance out of discrete components. The result of impedance mismatch is reflections and a degraded filter performance. Zobel found that a value of m=0.6 for the end half sections, while not mathematically exact, gave a good match to resistive terminations in the pass-band.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} expressions for image <b>impedances</b> are all {{referenced to}} the low-pass prototype section. They are scaled to the nominal impedance R0 = 1, and the frequencies in those expressions are all scaled to the cut-off frequency ωc = 1.|$|E
5000|$|In {{an audio}} system, the damping factor gives {{the ratio of}} the rated <b>impedance</b> of the {{loudspeaker}} to the source <b>impedance.</b> Only the resistive part of the loudspeaker <b>impedance</b> is used.

The source <b>impedance</b> (that seen by the loudspeaker) includes the connecting cable <b>impedance.</b> The load <b>impedance</b> [...] (input <b>impedance)</b> and the source <b>impedance</b> [...] (output <b>impedance)</b> are shown in the diagram.|$|R
50|$|<b>Impedance</b> {{matching}} {{to minimize}} reflections {{is achieved by}} making the load <b>impedance</b> equal to the source <b>impedance.</b> If the source <b>impedance,</b> load <b>impedance</b> and transmission line characteristic <b>impedance</b> are purely resistive, then reflection-less matching {{is the same as}} maximum power transfer matching.|$|R
40|$|The wave <b>impedance</b> and the {{environment}} <b>impedance</b> are important for the wave-variable based teleoperator.

5|$|While 600 Ω is {{an almost}} {{universal}} standard in telephony for local presentation at customer's premises from the exchange, for long distance transmission on trunk lines between exchanges other standard nominal <b>impedances</b> are used and are usually lower, such as 150 Ω.|$|E
5|$|Filters are {{required}} to operate at many different frequencies, <b>impedances</b> and bandwidths. The utility of a prototype filter comes from the property that all these other filters {{can be derived from}} it by applying a scaling factor to the components of the prototype. The filter design need thus only be carried out once in full, with other filters being obtained by simply applying a scaling factor.|$|E
5|$|A {{common theme}} {{throughout}} Zobel's {{work is the}} issue of impedance matching. The obvious approach to filter design is to design directly for the attenuation characteristics desired. With modern computing power, a brute force approach is possible and easy, simply incrementally adjusting each component while recalculating in an iterative process until the desired response is achieved. However, Zobel developed a more indirect line of attack. He realized very early on that mismatched <b>impedances</b> inevitably meant reflections, and reflections meant a loss of signal. Improving the impedance match, conversely, would automatically improve a filter's pass-band response.|$|E

5|$|The BBC had {{initiated}} tendering to {{have the}} LS3/5 made under license. As the broadcasting unit was about to order another batch of the monitor, {{it was found that}} KEF had discontinued the B110 (A6362) and the T27 (A6340) in favour of the B110 (SP1003) and T27 (SP1032) specification, and was already using them in the Coda, one of their own-brand commercial loudspeakers. Thus the design had to be revised because these new units had different <b>impedances,</b> technical characteristics and altered resonance patterns. The tweeter was considered potentially fragile because it now had an exposed dome, so a suitable protection grille was found to cover and protect the dome. The tweeter was also surrounded by a thick felt rectangle to prevent interference pattern effects being created by the edge of the cabinet. The crossover also had to undergo change, and the LS3/5 became the LS3/5A in the early summer of 1974.|$|E
5|$|The {{essence of}} network {{synthesis}} {{is to start}} with a required filter response and produce a network that delivers that response, or approximates to it within a specified boundary. This is the inverse of network analysis which starts with a given network and by applying the various electric circuit theorems predicts the response of the network. The term was first used with this meaning in the doctoral thesis of Yuk-Wing Lee (1930) and apparently arose out of a conversation with Vannevar Bush. The advantage of network synthesis over previous methods is that it provides a solution which precisely meets the design specification. This is not the case with image filters, a degree of experience is required in their design since the image filter only meets the design specification in the unrealistic case of being terminated in its own image impedance, to produce which would require the exact circuit being sought. Network synthesis on the other hand, takes care of the termination <b>impedances</b> simply by incorporating them into the network being designed.|$|E
