Compulsion in agricultural production continued. In May 1950 the authorities started investigations against Willi Heidenreich for bad economic management, not only a personal misfortune but made a crime then, after he was in delay with the compulsory deliveries. In July 1950 Banzendorf's relatively wealthy farmer family Degebrodt was expropriated their larger units of agricultural machines, such as a SB 34 1290 tractor, in favour of the <b>Farmers</b> <b>Mutual</b> <b>Aid</b> Association (Vereinigung der gegenseitigen Bauernhilfe; VdgB), established in autumn 1945.|$|E

40|$|<b>Mutual</b> <b>aid</b> {{groups are}} a source of {{structure}} and continuing support for people seeking recovery from alcohol or drug dependence, and for those directly or indirectly affected by dependence, such as partners, close friends, children and other family members. The evidence base shows that clients who actively participate in <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> are more likely to sustain their recovery, and the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that treatment staff routinely provide information about <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> groups and facilitate access {{for those who want to}} attend (NICE, 2007; NICE, 2011; NICE, 2012). In working towards compliance with NICE quality standards, local commissioners and service providers will seek to ensure that facilitating access to <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> is supported within the local recovery system and that keyworkers recognise it as an integral part of their role. Keyworkers must give thought to the way they approach the subject of <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> with their clients because the evidence shows that simply providing information and leaving them to make contact often results in them either never attending or quickly dropping out (Humphreys, 1999). A more active approach involves services promoting and hosting local meetings, holding explicit and structured conversations with clients, and setting care-planned goals around attending and engaging. Evidence shows that this kind of approach is usually more effective (Timko et al., 2006). Some specialist interventions have been developed to help clients engage with specific <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> organisations (eg, 12 -step facilitation, SMART Recovery Partnership programme and other structured programmes). However, these protocols require specialised training, which is usually delivered over eight to 12 weekly sessions in a group setting. This document provides keyworkers with a pragmatic intervention adapted from an evidence-based approach to facilitating access to <b>mutual</b> <b>aid,</b> using their existing skills in regular one-to-one key-work sessions. It focuses on holding explicit and structured conversations with clients, and setting care-planned goals around attending and engaging in <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> programmes. About the <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> self-assessment tool: This self-assessment tool has been developed to support local authority partnerships to improve their understanding of the availability of <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> locally, to identify any gaps that may exist and to highlight any potential barriers that may need to be overcome. The information gathered as a result of its undertaking will enable partnerships to develop a local action plan that ensures they are taking steps towards fostering effective links between treatment services and local <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> groups, and ensuring that all clients have the opportunity and encouragement to access a <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> programme of their choice. It is suggested that local commissioners of alcohol and drug services lead on this <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> self-assessment. The quality of the self-assessment is likely to be enhanced by completing it in close collaboration with local treatment providers, service user representatives and where possible representatives of local <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> groups.

40|$|According to a draft bill {{currently}} {{before the}} Italian Parliament, <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> societies {{should be considered}} as part of the Third Sector. And yet, when considering the primary aim of <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> societies (i. e. benefiting their members, rather than society at large), this position cannot be taken for granted. The paper discusses the opportunity to include <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> societies into a more broadly defined Third Sector, by investigating the activities that these organizations are actually carrying out, with particular reference to the organizations working in health and social care services. The authors compare the nature and purposes of <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> societies and with those of other Third Sector organizations, and discuss the potential benefit of including this particular category for advancing the Italian welfare system. Including <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> societies into the Third Sector could enhance the social role of these institutions and increase the contribution that private organizations pursuing collective aims can give to {{the construction of a new}} – and more pluralistic – welfare system...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} {{been a great deal of}} {{interest}} and commitment from both academic and wider policy-making circles in the meso and micro-levels of production and exchange in society. To this end, theoretical and empirical research has led to a more penetrative understanding of the cultural and social embeddedness of economic spaces. By bringing into focus the informal economic sphere, this in turn has placed activities conducted through <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> firmly under the academic and policy-making spotlight.;From an academic perspective however, it is clear that comparatively little is known about <b>mutual</b> <b>aid,</b> though significant progress has been made on mapping its more quantitative dimensions, such as its extent, character, social embeddedness and the key barriers that obstruct greater participation. This particular focus has exposed many prejudices about exchange in society, not least by providing evidence that <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> is far from a marginal or residual realm of daily life in advanced economies, and has resulted in the emergence of <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> as both a legitimate and serious focus for research to explore.;Through an in-depth case study of two urban areas in Leicester (England), the robustness of contemporary research will be tested by highlighting existing geographies of <b>mutual</b> <b>aid.</b> More fundamentally though, the discussion will depart from this into relatively uncharted territories by embracing the next significant phase of research on <b>mutual</b> <b>aid.</b> This involves engaging with a deeper and more qualitative understanding of the complex dynamics which underpin the geographies of <b>mutual</b> <b>aid,</b> and are themselves engaged through the process of mutual aid.;By focusing on the social dynamics of mutual aid; the internal dynamics of mutual aid; the notion of space, place and mutual aid; and the question as to why aid is so pervasive in the advanced economies, a more complicated and dynamic understanding of <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> in advanced economies emerges...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Farmers</b> <b>Mutual</b> Reinsurance Company Building is a {{historic}} structure located in Grinnell, Iowa, United States. [...] "The Iowa <b>Farmers</b> <b>Mutual</b> Reinsurance Association was the first statewide organization {{of its kind in}} the United States." [...] When it moved to Grinnell from Jefferson, Iowa in 1934 its name was changed to <b>Farmers</b> <b>Mutual</b> Reinsurance Company. It was still a relatively small operation at the time that required only simple rented upstairs quarters. The present building was first occupied in 1951, but only the first two floors were built. The top two floors were completed in 1957, and gave the building its present form. The company rented out the first floor to other commercial businesses. <b>Farmers</b> <b>Mutual</b> Reinsurance Company moved out of building in 1962 to a larger complex south of Grinnell, and at that time became known as the Grinnell Mutual Reinsurance Company. This building was sold to the General Telephone Company, which occupied the whole building until 1968. The Trustees of Iowa (Grinnell) College, GTE Data of Iowa, and DeLong's Sportswear have all subsequently owned the building.|$|R
40|$|<b>Mutual</b> <b>Aid</b> {{refers to}} the social, {{emotional}} and informational support provided by, and to, {{members of a group}} at every stage of recovery. Groups often include people who are abstinent and want help to remain so – these people are actively changing their behaviour using a programme of <b>mutual</b> <b>aid.</b> They also include people who are thinking about stopping and/or actively trying to stop their drug and alcohol use. Groups also exist to support families, children and friends affected by substance misuse. The most common <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> groups in England include 12 -step fellowships and SMART Recovery. The fellowships (eg, Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), Narcotics Anonymous (NA), Cocaine Anonymous (CA) and Al-Anon) are based on a 12 -step selfhelp philosophy developed in the 1930 s. SMART Recovery applies cognitive behavioural techniques and therapeutic lifestyle change to its <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> groups to help people manage their recovery.
