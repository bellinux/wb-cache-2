40|$|An {{approximate}} six-parameter {{analytic model}} for Earth-based differenced range measurements is presented {{and is used}} to derive a representative analytic approximation for differenced Doppler measurements. The analytical models are tasked to investigate the ability of these data types to estimate spacecraft <b>geocentric</b> <b>angular</b> motion, Deep <b>Space</b> Network station oscillator (clock/frequency) offsets, and signal-path calibration errors {{over a period of}} a few days, in the presence of systematic station location and transmission media calibration errors. Quantitative results indicate that a few differenced Doppler plus ranging passes yield angular position estimates with a precision on the order of 0. 1 to 0. 4 microrad, and angular rate precision on the order of 10 to 25 (10) (exp - 12) rad/sec, assuming no a priori information on the coordinate parameters. Sensitivity analyses suggest that troposphere zenith delay calibration error is the dominant systematic error source in most of the tracking scenarios investigated; as expected, the differenced Doppler data were found to be much more sensitive to troposphere calibration errors than differenced range. By comparison, results computed using wide band and narrow band (delta) VLBI under similar circumstances yielded angular precisions of 0. 07 to 0. 4 /microrad, and angular rate precisions of 0. 5 to 1. 0 (10) (exp - 12) rad/sec...|$|R

40|$|A noisy {{disc brake}} vibrates in a wavelike manner with a {{diametral}} mode of vibration. The mode shape exhibits antinodes with <b>angular</b> <b>spacing</b> {{of a specific}} size related to the noise frequency and mode order. The sizes of the antinodes vary slightly with brake pressure which causes a slight change in noise frequency. If the <b>angular</b> <b>spacing</b> of the callipers is arranged such that an integer of antinodes between the callipers is not possible then the disc is inhibited from vibrating in a given mode and noise at that frequency is prevented. The paper demonstrates that at particular angular settings of the callipers certain frequencies exist yet as the angular settings are changed the disc mode order and related frequency changes. It is shown that the frequencies {{can be related to}} the <b>angular</b> <b>spacing</b> between the callipers and the free mode <b>angular</b> <b>spacing</b> of the disc waveform antinodes. An analysis of the geometry allowed the brake noise frequency to be predicted for a certain angular setting of the callipers and specific angular settings to be predicted when the brake would be quiet. It is shown that this analysis was successfully applied in practice on the test rig and on the problematic vehicle. It is shown that the theory may be extended to single calliper brakes and adjustment of the pad/disc interface geometry...|$|R

The application of high-accuracy S/X-band and X-band ranging to orbit determination with relatively short data arcs is investigated in planetary approach and encounter scenarios.

The Ulysses trajectory solutions indicate that the aim point for the spacecraft's February 1992 Jupiter encounter was predicted to a geocentric accuracy of 0. 20 to 0. 23 /microrad. Explicit modeling of range bias parameters for each station pass is shown to largely remove systematic ground system calibration errors and transmission media effects from the Ulysses range measurements, which would otherwise corrupt the angle finding capabilities of the data.
