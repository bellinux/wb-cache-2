40|$|Due to the {{complicated}} tooth geometry of worm gears, their design to achieve high capacity and favourable performance is a tedious task, and the optimum design is hardly to obtain. In order {{to overcome this}} problem, the authors developed an integrated approach which consists of three modules: numerical analysis, three-dimensional simulation and finite element analysis. It provides {{a powerful tool for}} optimum design of worm gears and is a general approach applicable for various types of worm gears. As case studies, two designs using the approach have been conducted, one for cylindrical involute worm gearing and the other for double <b>enveloping</b> <b>worm</b> gearing...|$|E

In this paper,based on the spatial meshing theory,a parameterized mathematical model of the dual-cone double <b>enveloping</b> hourglass <b>worm</b> gear pair is established,which is simplified as a digitized modeling method based on six basic parameters of the worm gear pair. Virtual machining modeling plug-in programming is achieved through the solidworks development platform.

40|$|Abstract: The {{processing}} of worm gear components is quite simple, and manufacturing method is relatively complete, there’s {{no need to}} make special equipment. But to new energy equipment, research new-type of manufacturing technology is required. On the basis of meshing theory and drawing on manufacture of the planar enveloping {{as well as the}} tapper <b>enveloping</b> hourglass <b>worm,</b> a research of manufacture technique about the non-backlash double-roller <b>enveloping</b> hourglass <b>worm</b> drive has conducted on the Y 3180 E gear-hobbing machines and four-axis four-linkage NC machines. The key pieces have been processed out, and a calibration has been conducted on the single-head worm. All of these work will provid a theoretical foundation and practical experience for the actual manufacture. Worm drive as important type of drive in mechanical drive, it obtained widespread application in national defense, metallurgy, shipbuilding, building, chemical industry and other professions[1, 2]. In order to solve lateral clearance problem in the worm drive, many scholars {{have done a lot of}} research. A composite modulus worm drive was proposed, which has a two-pitch cylindrical wor...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} new method for {{creating}} the accurate 3 D geometry model of the plane <b>enveloping</b> hourglass <b>worm</b> efficiently. The working tooth surfaces of the <b>worm</b> are <b>enveloped</b> by the mother plane surfaces. And according to the gear engagement theory, the equations of the surfaces enveloped are established. By combination with engineering practice, the geometrical features of the surface enveloped are analyzed, {{and one of its}} features {{is that it is a}} ruled surface consisted of countless straight lines which are contact lines. For ∑(u, Φ 1), which represents the surface enveloped, let the variable u equals two values respectively, and two helix curves are gained. Connect the two curves with a ruled surface, and make sure that the ruled surface is consisted of contact lines. So the surface gained is a enveloped surface with no error existing in theory. Once the surfaces enveloped are gained, it’s easy to create the geometry model of the worm. Using UG, the paper provides an example showing how to create the worm’s model, and the new method and a past method are both used to create the model. The new method not only creates an accurate model, but also improves the efficiency. For example, at the time-consuming step {{for creating the}} surface enveloped, compared with the past method, the new method is able to save approximate 94 % of the time...|$|R
