5|$|On remand, the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York {{had found}} the {{counties}} liable to the Oneida for wrongful possession of their lands, awarded damages of $16,694, plus interest, representing the fair rental value {{of the land in}} question for the 2-year period specified in the complaint. Finally, the District Court required New York state to <b>indemnify</b> the counties. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed.|$|E
5|$|O'Brien {{immediately}} {{sued the}} British Government for false imprisonment, {{and to avoid}} any liability the government prepared the Restoration of Order in Ireland (Indemnity) Act 1923 which would <b>indemnify</b> them against any claims for damages by the imprisoned sympathisers. The Labour Party whittled it down when it was being prepared {{so that it would}} only limit compensation rather than remove it entirely. A tribunal was set up under Lord Atkin to assess damages, and the sympathisers as a whole were eventually paid £43,000. Art O'Brien himself was arrested soon after release and convicted of sedition. He was released in 1924.|$|E
5|$|Crittenden's {{support of}} a new {{election}} was both popular and politically expedient. When the U.S. Senate term of Martin D. Hardin, one of Slaughter's unpopular nominees, expired in 1817, the Kentucky General Assembly chose Crittenden to fill the vacancy. Though he was {{the youngest member of}} the body, he served as the second-ever chairman of the newly created Committee on the Judiciary. He was {{also a member of the}} Committee on Naval Affairs. During his term, he introduced legislation to reimburse and <b>indemnify</b> persons who were fined under the 1798 Sedition Act. He found state politics more interesting, however, and this fact, coupled with increased financial responsibilities incurred by the birth of his third and fourth children, prompted his decision to resign his seat on March 3, 1819.|$|E

The purchased insurance is typically in addition to this corporate indemnification, or reimburses the corporation. In some states corporations may be mandated to <b>indemnify</b> directors and officers in order to encourage people to take the positions and in most cases the corporations have the option to <b>indemnify</b> their officers. However, in certain cases the corporation may be explicitly forbidden from indemnifying such director or officer. Liabilities which aren't indemnified by the corporation are potentially covered by certain types of D insurance (particularly Side-A Broad Form DIC policies).|$|E

25|$|Insurance is a {{financial}} instrument, which allows exposed individuals to pool resources to spread their risk.

25|$|The {{parties had}} turned to {{arbitration}} to settle a lingering issue from the termination of a lease: whether Mattel was contractually bound to <b>indemnify</b> Hall Street for environmental contamination {{to the site of}} a factory it rented from Hall Street in Beaverton, Oregon until closing it in 2001. The arbitrator had decided that the statute covering the groundwater pollution was primarily a health law, and so ruled that Mattel did not have to pay Hall Street's costs. Since the arbitration agreement had taken the form of an order from a district judge, Mattel and Hall Street had included a provision that the judge could review the arbitration award, he did and the award was reversed. It went back and forth twice between the district court and the Ninth Circuit before the Supreme Court granted certiorari.|$|E
25|$|On August 1, 1828, {{a man by}} {{the name}} of Barney Griffin, who had {{travelled}} from Syracuse to the Village of Sackets Harbor several days earlier, ended up dying in the Jefferson County Poor House. Orville went over to investigate. Upon searching Griffin's clothes, he found the cash sum of two hundred and twenty-two dollars and fifteen cents - more than enough money for Griffin to pay for a hotel. Hungerford put an advertisement in the a paper to see if a relative would claim the money. No one did. He then turned the money over to the County Treasurer for use of the Poor House, deducting a dollar for the advertisement money that came out of his own pocket. Understanding the nature of greed, he asked the County Board of Supervisors to <b>indemnify</b> him for his actions, which it agreed to do.|$|E
25|$|Despite its incapacitating effects, {{existing}} bans on {{the opium}} trade in China were generally ignored until the 1833 Government of India Act eliminated the East India Company's monopoly on British trade with China. British officials noted the unrestrained influx of new smugglers was greatly alarming the Chinese but {{were unable to}} rein them in before the viceroy Lin Zexu placed the foreign factories under complete blockade, demanding the surrender of all opium held in the Pearl River Delta. The British were only able to provide it after their superintendent guaranteed to <b>indemnify</b> the loss. The sum {{turned out to be}} so large (£3,000,000) that it prompted the First Opium War, The 1842 Treaty of Nanking – the beginning of the unequal treaties that restricted Qing sovereignty in the 19th century – is generally taken to have ended China's isolation, {{with the opening of the}} ports of Xiamen ("Amoy"), Fuzhou ("Fuchow"), Ningbo ("Ningpo"), and Shanghai, but legal trade continued to be limited to specified ports until the end of the dynasty. Nonetheless, the war began a pattern of war, defeat, concessions, and reparations, further weakening the Chinese government and economy through the outflow of silver.|$|E
50|$|The Court of Appeal held, after {{noting that}} {{interest}} was awardable under the court's equitable jurisdiction, that Mr Moir could be <b>indemnified</b> {{by the company}} for his costs. Since the derivative claim meant the company was proceeding against Dr Wallersteiner, Mr Moir was ineligible for legal aid. Moreover, contingency fee arrangements with Mr Moir's lawyers could not be sanctioned (although Lord Denning MR opined that public policy might approve it in some derivative claims). Hence, the costs of litigation for minority shareholders would be <b>indemnified</b> by the company.|$|R

25|$|According to {{the initial}} {{investigation}} conducted by the Philippine Coast Guard, only one apprentice {{member of the crew}} of the Doña Paz was monitoring the bridge when the accident occurred. Other officers were either drinking beer or watching television in the crew's recreation quarters, while the ship's captain was watching a movie on his Betamax in his cabin. Nonetheless, subsequent inquiries revealed that the Vector was operating without a license, lookout or properly qualified master. The Board of Marine Inquiry eventually cleared Sulpicio Lines of fault in the accident. In 1999, the Supreme Court of the Philippines ruled that it was the owners of the Vector who were liable to <b>indemnify</b> the victims of the collision. Some of the claims pursued against either Sulpicio Lines or the owners of the Vector, such as those filed by the Cañezal family (who lost two members) and the Macasas family (who lost three members) were adjudicated by the Supreme Court, which found that even the families of victims who did not appear on the official manifest were entitled to indemnity. Caltex Philippines, which had chartered the Vector, was likewise cleared of financial liability.|$|E
25|$|The Hungarian-American {{business}} magnate George Soros warns in “Does the Euro have a Future?” {{that there}} is no escape from the “gloomy scenario” of a prolonged European recession and the consequent threat to the Eurozone’s political cohesion so long as “the authorities persist in their current course.” He argues that to save the Euro long-term structural changes are essential in addition to the immediate steps needed to arrest the crisis. The changes he recommends include even greater economic integration of the European Union. Soros writes that a treaty is needed to transform the European Financial Stability Fund into a full-fledged European Treasury. Following the formation of the Treasury, European Council could then ask the European Commission Bank to step into the breach and <b>indemnify</b> the European Commission Bank in advance against potential risks to the Treasury’s solvency. Soros acknowledges that converting the EFSF into a European Treasury will necessitate “a radical change of heart.” In particular, he cautions, Germans will be wary of any such move, not least because many continue to believe that they have a choice between saving the Euro and abandoning it. Soros writes however that a collapse of European Union would precipitate an uncontrollable financial meltdown and thus “the only way” to avert “another Great Depression” is the formation of a European Treasury.|$|E
25|$|The Boxer Movement or Boxer Rebellion, which {{occurred}} in China from November 1899 to September 7, 1901, was an uprising {{by members of}} the Chinese Society of Right and Harmonious Fists against foreign influence in areas such as trade, politics, religion and technology that occurred in China during the final years of the Manchu rule (Qing Dynasty). The members of the Society of Right and Harmonious Fists were simply called boxers by the Westerners due to the martial arts and calisthenics they practiced. The uprising began as an anti-foreign, anti-imperialist peasant-based movement in northern China. They attacked foreigners who were building railroads and violating Feng shui, as well as Christians, who were held responsible for the foreign domination of China. In June 1900, the Boxers invaded Beijing and killed 230 non-Chinese. Tens of thousands of Chinese Christians, Catholic and Protestant alike, were killed mostly in Shandong and Shanxi Provinces as part of the uprising. The government of Empress Dowager Cixi was not helpful, and diplomats, foreign civilians, soldiers and some Chinese Christians retreated to the legation quarter where they held out for fifty-five days until a multinational coalition rushed 20,000 troops to their rescue. The Chinese government was forced to <b>indemnify</b> the victims and make many additional concessions. Subsequent reforms implemented after the crisis of 1900 laid the foundation {{for the end of the}} Qing Dynasty and the establishment of the modern Chinese Republic.|$|E

25|$|The ADA {{provides}} explicit {{coverage for}} service animals. Guidelines {{have been developed}} not only to protect persons with disabilities, but also to <b>indemnify</b> businesses from damages related to granting access to service animals on their premises. Businesses are allowed to ask if the animal is a service animal and ask what tasks it is trained to perform, {{but they are not}} allowed to ask the service animal to perform the task nor ask for a special ID of the animal. They can not ask what the person's disabilities are. A person with a disability can not be removed from the premises unless either of two things happen: the animal is out of control and its owner can not get it under control (e.g. a dog barking uncontrollably in a restaurant), or the animal is a direct threat to people's health and safety. Allergies and fear of animal would not be considered a threat to people's health and safety so {{it would not be a}} valid reason to deny access to people with service animals. Businesses that prepare or serve food must allow service animals and their owners on the premises even if state or local health laws otherwise prohibit animals on the premise. In this case, businesses that prepare or serve food are not required to provide care or food for service animals nor do they have to provide a designated area for the service animal to use the bathroom. Lastly, people that require service dogs can not be charged an extra fee for their service dog or be treated unfairly. For example, being isolated from people at a restaurant. People with disabilities can not be treated less than other customers. However, if a business normally charges for damages caused by the person to property, the customer with a disability will be charged for his/her service animal's damages to the property.|$|E

[...] The provision allowing for the hiring of outside artists was inserted at the suggestion of former director Patterson. The act set the salaries and bonding requirements for the officers, and required them to be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, as was the case under both the 1792 and 1837 acts.
