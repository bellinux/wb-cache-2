40|$|Abstract This article {{discusses}} the contribution made by Francesco Fuoco (1774 - 1841) to the methodological {{debate in the}} early nineteenth century. In opposition to Say's view, Fuoco defended the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the deductive method in economic analysis, upholding the mathématique sociale tradition. This perspective characterizes his main work, Saggi economici (1825 ??? 27), in which he expounded a systematic view of economic theory and synthesized, within the framework of deductive methodology, a typical subjectivist theory of value, drawn from Condillac, with the new Ricardian theory of distribution. As he engaged in defense of the deductive nature of economic analysis, Fuoco found <b>confirmation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the mathématique sociale tradition in the Ricardian new theory of rent.
