40|$|In organic agriculture, {{treatments}} {{with rock}} dusts for soil amendment, disease prevention, or insect control {{have a long}} tradition. Clinoptilolite (a naturally occurring zeolite) was tested against pollen beetle Meligethes spp. in oilseed rape fields {{in order to find}} a control strategy compatible with the guidelines for organic agriculture in Switzerland. Dust and spray applications were evaluated in several large-scale field trials from 2008 to 2010. Dust applications using 300 - 750 kg / ha pulverized Clinoptilolite (particle size < 0. 1 mm; product Klinofeed, company Unipoint, Switzerland) were applied using a drop-box fertilizer spreader or a Vicon pendulum spreader. For spray applications the same Clinoptilolite (product Klinospray) with a particle size of 0. 017 mm was applied at rates of 30 - 50 kg / ha with a wetting agent (Heliosol, 2 l / ha; 600 l waster / ha) using a standard <b>field</b> <b>crop</b> <b>sprayer.</b> Under the dry and sunny weather conditions in 2009 and 2010, the treatments significantly reduced the number of pollen beetles by 50 to 80 % until seven days after treatment (BBCH 51 - 54). Under the rainy weather conditions in 2008, no reduction of pollen beetles was observed. In all experimental years a visibly more intense flowering was observed in the treated plots. Pod setting on the main raceme was significantly increased in the treated plots...|$|E
40|$|Spray drift {{continues}} to be a major problem in applying agricultural pesticides. This article summarizes the results of a five-year study of drift from <b>field</b> <b>crop</b> <b>sprayers</b> using a unique integrated approach. Indirect (spray quality and wind tunnel measurements) and direct (field) drift experiments were performed, and drift models were developed to study the effect of spray application technique, droplet characteristics, buffer zones, meteorological conditions, spray liquid properties, border structures, and crop characteristics on drift from <b>field</b> <b>crop</b> <b>sprayers.</b> It was found that indirect drift measurements can be a valuable alternative to field drift experiments. A validated 3 -D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) mechanistic drift model was developed, which can be used for a systemic study of different influencing factors. This model was reduced to a fast 2 -D diffusion advection model, which is useful as a hands-on drift prediction tool. From the experiments {{as well as from the}} models, the fraction of small droplets and the spray boom height were found to be the most influential spray application factors. Moreover, meteorological conditions as well as crop characteristics have an important effect on the amount of spray drift, which can be reduced significantly using intercepting screens or buffer zones. From this study, drift protocols, data, and models are made available, which help to understand and reduce the complex phenomena of spray drift...|$|R
40|$|During {{pesticide}} application {{spray drift}} may cause diffuse pollution phenomena in the environment. In {{the last years}} the European Union, through the Directive on the sustainable use of pesticides (128 / 2009 EC), has recommended the adoption of measures enabling to prevent spray drift. Among these measures, the adoption of buffer zones beside the sprayed fields requires to consider different widths for these no spray zones according {{to the amount of}} spray drift generated by the spraying equipment used for application. It is therefore necessary to classify the different sprayer models according to drift risk. For what concerns the sprayers used on arboreal crops, in order to make this classification in a simple and quick way as it was already proposed for the <b>field</b> <b>crop</b> <b>sprayers</b> (ISO FDIS 22369 - 3), a study was started aimed at defining a methodology to assess potential drift produced by the different sprayer models in absence of wind, using ad hoc test benches. On the basis of the positive first experimental data obtained, a first proposal for a new ISO standard methodology was prepared...|$|R
40|$|Because of {{variations}} in environmental conditions, spray-drift field measurements following ISO 22866 : 2005 involve complicated and time-consuming experiments often with low repeatability. Therefore, simple, repeatable, and precise alternative drift assessment methods that are complementary {{to the official}} standards are required. One of the alternatives {{is the use of}} a drift test bench for <b>field</b> <b>crop</b> <b>sprayers.</b> Previous studies have demonstrated that the drift test bench can be considered an adequate complement to existing standard protocols for field drift measurements. In this study, in order to further improve the methodology and to evaluate the possibility of classifying different field-crop-sprayer settings according to drift risk using a test bench, a series of tests were performed in a test hall. A conventional mounted Delvano HD 3 <b>crop</b> <b>sprayer</b> (Delvano, Kuurne, Belgium) equipped with an 800 -l spray tank and a 15 -m-wide stainless steel spray boom was used. Eight different sprayer setups were tested, involving three nozzle types (TeeJet XR 110 04, Agrotop TDXL 110 04 and Micron Micromax 3) and three boom heights (0. 30, 0. 50, and 0. 70 m). For the drift classification, the reference sprayer drift behaviour was defined as that obtained using conventional flat fan TeeJet XR 110 04 nozzles operated at 0. 30 MPa and at a boom height of 0. 50 m. The different sprayer setups were successfully assigned to different drift reduction classes, and the results underlined the effects of nozzle type and boom height on the potential drift. The feasibility of the test-bench methodology for classifying field-crop-sprayer drift according to ISO 22369 - 1 : 2006 was demonstrated. Postprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|The EN 13790 and {{agricultural}} products certification standards stimulated the sprayers inspections in a yearly basis in Portugal. Since 2006 Centro Operativo e Tecnológico Hortofrutícola Nacional (COTHN) inspected almost 3000 sprayers throughout the all country, including <b>field</b> <b>crops</b> <b>sprayers,</b> air assisted sprayers for bush and tree crops {{and a few}} hand held <b>sprayers</b> for greenhouse <b>crops.</b> In 2009 and 2010, Ambi 3 Q and A. CANO began with sprayers inspections {{in the north and}} south of Portugal, respectively. The implementation of the article 8 of the European Directive CE 128 / 09 in all member states is an important step to minimize environmental impacts, protect human health and improve plant protection efficacy. However it is not an easy task due to the characteristics of agriculture and sprayers in use of each country. The actual legislation concerning the construction and inspection of sprayers was published in the last 3 years. According to the article 8 of the European Directive, the Official Service Direcção-Geral de Agricultura e Desenvolvimento Rural (DGADR) of the Agriculture Ministry, developed the Portuguese law Decreto-Lei n. º 86 / 2010 de 15 de Julho, in 2010, to impose that mounted sprayers, trailed sprayers and self-propelled sprayers must be inspected and approved before 26 November, 2016. The sprayers inspections carried out in Portugal should be an important tool to assess the sprayers in use and decide the best action plan to implement the article 8. Despite the sprayers inspections had been done mostly {{as a consequence of the}} European and National market rules, and so, the data collected are a rough sample of the real Portuguese situation, it is possible to observe that only one-third, of the sprayers inspected until now, have less than 5 years old. This means that the majority of the sprayers may not be in accordance with the standards and the article 8 of the European Directive...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent {{studies have}} {{reported}} an increased prevalence of respiratory symptoms among farm workers. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify risk factors associated with spider mite allergy among table grape farm workers. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 207 workers in table grape farms was conducted. Skin prick tests used extracts of 8 common aeroallergens, grape mould (Botrytis cinerea) and Tetranychus urticae. Specific IgE to T. urticae was quantified using ImmunoCAP (Phadia). Erythrocyte cholinesterase levels were determined using the Test-mate ChE Cholinesterase Test System (model 460). Results: The average duration of employment of workers was 10 years and 12 % were pesticide <b>crop</b> <b>sprayers.</b> Work-related wheeze (26 %), ocular-nasal (24 %) and urticaria/skin symptoms (14 %) were more prevalent in the orchards. The prevalence of sensitization (skin prick test) was highest to T. urticae (22 %) followed by house dust mite (16 %), with 25 % being atopic. The prevalence of allergy to T. urticae (skin reactivity and work-related symptoms) was 9. 5 %, with respiratory allergy (6 %) more common than skin allergy (3 %). Work-related ocular-nasal (OR = 4. 9) and skin (OR = 3. 7) symptoms were more commonly reported by pesticide <b>crop</b> <b>sprayers.</b> Workers with T. urticae-allergic rhino-conjunctivitis and probable asthma were more likely to be atopic, spray pesticides and have low (< 30 U/g hemoglobin) erythrocyte cholinesterase levels. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that spider mite, T. urticae, is an important outdoor allergen among table grape farm workers. The increased risk of spider mite allergy appears to be related to high pesticide exposure among <b>crop</b> <b>sprayers...</b>|$|R
