40|$|Abstract Information {{regarding}} genetic base, {{nature and}} strength of association and effect of different yield component and quality traits on final yield is prerequisite of a crop improvement program. Twenty one genotypes of tomato were sown in triplicated complete randomized design to access this information. All traits showed considerable genetic variation with variable environmental influence. Additive gene action was involved in expression of days to 50 % flowering, vine length, number of <b>fruits</b> per <b>plant</b> and <b>fruit</b> weight. Dominance played major role for number of <b>fruit</b> clusters per <b>plant</b> and lycopene contents. Number of <b>fruit</b> clusters per <b>plant,</b> number of <b>fruits</b> per <b>plant,</b> <b>fruit</b> weight, fruit firmness and lycopene contents had strong positive association with fresh <b>fruit</b> yield per <b>plant</b> at genotypic level. Number of <b>fruit</b> clusters per <b>plant</b> had maximum direct effect on fresh fruit yield followed by fruit weight, number of <b>fruits</b> per <b>plant</b> and days to 50 % flowering.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The F 2 segregating {{generations of}} exotic tomato hybrids were studied to measure variability, {{character}} association and path coefficient analysis. Analysis of variance for each trait showed {{significant differences among}} the genotypes. Very little differences were observed between phenotypic coefficients of variation (PCV) and genotypic coefficients of variation (GCV) for the traits days to first flowering (pcv= 9. 21, gcv= 7. 82), fruit length (pcv= 17. 14, gcv= 14. 84) and fruit diameter (pcv= 17. 10, gcv= 14. 92). High heritability (> 50 %) was observed for all the yield contributing characters except flowers per cluster (47. 83 %). High heritability associated with high genetic advance was observed for <b>fruit</b> clusters per <b>plant</b> (105. 11), <b>fruits</b> per <b>plant</b> (103. 43), branches per <b>plant</b> (34. 49), <b>fruits</b> per cluster (47. 43), individual fruit weight (77. 73) and <b>fruit</b> yield per <b>plant</b> (108. 25). Selection for such traits might be effective for the fruit yield improvement of tomato. Significant positive genotypic and phenotypic correlation was observed between plant height at first flowering, flowers per <b>plant,</b> <b>fruits</b> per cluster, <b>fruit</b> clusters per <b>plant,</b> <b>fruits</b> per <b>plant</b> with <b>fruit</b> yield per <b>plant.</b> <b>Fruits</b> per <b>plant</b> showed the highest positive direct effect (1. 096) on <b>fruit</b> yield per <b>plant</b> followed by individual <b>fruits</b> per <b>plant</b> (0. 674).

In total, 53 avian species were involved in fruit removal of 31 fleshy-fruiting plant species. Species specialisation was always higher for plants than for frugivores. Both species and network-level specialisation increased with increasing fruit abundance and decreased with increasing <b>fruiting</b> <b>plant</b> species richness and canopy cover within fragments. Interaction diversity was unaffected by fruit abundance and canopy cover, but increased slightly with increasing <b>fruiting</b> <b>plant</b> species richness.

Multiple correlations are useful in finding a balance between principal characters studied in breeding programs. The aim {{of the study was}} the evaluation of principal component characters of production capacity in a collection of 24 landraces of sweet pepper landraces from West Romania. Evaluated characters were: number of <b>fruit</b> per <b>plant,</b> <b>fruit</b> length, fruit diameter, fruit weight, pulp thickness, pulp weight, number of seeds in fruit, production of <b>fruits</b> per <b>plant.</b> The evaluated collection presents incresed variability for number of <b>fruits</b> per <b>plant,</b> average weight of single fruit and fruit pulp weight. Production of <b>fruit</b> per <b>plant,</b> <b>fruit</b> diameter and fruit length are lower. Production of <b>fruits</b> per <b>plant</b> is influenced in proportion of 50 % by fruit number and secondly by fruit diameter. Fruit diameter has a significant and major contribution (over 70 %) on fruit weight, less important beeing the fruit length and diameter, pulp thickness. From simple regressions study we conclude that single fruit weight is influenced by fruit diameter and pulp thickness, and production per plant depends on number of <b>fruits</b> per <b>plant</b> and <b>fruit</b> diameter.
