After years of politics being dominated by the elderly Menzies and Calwell, the younger Holt {{was seen as a}} breath of <b>fresh</b> <b>air,</b> <b>and</b> attracted public interest and support {{in the run-up to the}} November election.|$|E
5|$|Aesthetics as {{a factor}} of well-being. From the early austere {{principle}} that form should strictly follow function, {{there is a growing}} sensibility that aesthetics affect the physical and emotional health of those who use a building or structure. Norwegian laws concerning occupational health have for several decades emphasized access to daylight and <b>fresh</b> <b>air,</b> <b>and</b> it may also be that harsh climatic conditions create an added imperative for uplifting aesthetics.|$|E
5|$|Amelia visits Meredith to {{apologize}} for her prior behavior and discuss her sobriety. Amelia confides in Meredith that she is scared to lose her, but Meredith responds {{that she is not}} ready to forgive her. Webber takes Meredith out for some <b>fresh</b> <b>air,</b> <b>and</b> gives her a talk about the power of forgiveness. He encourages her to forgive Amelia, Penny, Derek, and most importantly herself. She agrees to meet Lou. He introduces his wife and two daughters and then offers a sincere apology for what happened. Meredith, still unable to speak, takes his hand as a way of conveying her forgiveness.|$|E

25|$|Some newer {{hospitals}} now try {{to re-establish}} design {{that takes the}} patient's psychological needs into account, such as providing more fresh air, better views and more pleasant colour schemes. These ideas harken back to the late eighteenth century, when the concept of providing <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> access to the 'healing powers of nature' were first employed by hospital architects in improving their buildings.|$|E
25|$|President Garfield {{was brought}} to Long Branch {{in the hope that}} the <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> quiet might aid his {{recovery}} after being shot on July 2, 1881, an incident that left the assassin's bullet lodged in his spine. He died here on September 19, 1881, exactly two months before his 50th birthday. The Garfield Tea House, constructed from railroad ties that had been laid to carry Garfield's train, is in Elberon.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the first}} dietitians was the English doctor George Cheyne. He himself was tremendously {{overweight}} and would constantly eat large quantities of rich food and drink. He began a meatless diet, taking only milk and vegetables, and soon regained his health. He began publicly recommending his diet for everyone suffering from obesity. In 1724, he wrote An Essay of Health and Long Life, in which he advises exercise and <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> avoiding luxury foods.|$|E

25|$|After the {{establishment}} in the 1880s {{that the disease}} was contagious, TB was made a notifiable disease in Britain; there were campaigns to stop spitting in public places, and the infected poor were pressured to enter sanatoria that resembled prisons; the sanatoria for {{the middle and upper}} classes offered excellent care and constant medical attention. Whatever the purported benefits of the <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> labor in the sanatoria, even under the best conditions, 50% of those who entered were dead within five years (1916).|$|E
25|$|During the Enlightenment {{attitudes towards}} {{the mentally ill}} began to change. It came {{to be viewed as}} a {{disorder}} that required compassionate treatment. In 1758 English physician William Battie wrote his Treatise on Madness on the management of mental disorder. It was a critique aimed particularly at the Bethlem Hospital, where a conservative regime continued to use barbaric custodial treatment. Battie argued for a tailored management of patients entailing cleanliness, good food, <b>fresh</b> <b>air,</b> <b>and</b> distraction from friends and family. He argued that mental disorder originated from dysfunction of the material brain and body rather than the internal workings of the mind.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Judt was {{diagnosed}} with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease. From October 2009, he was paralyzed from the neck down. He was nevertheless able to give a two-hour public lecture. In January 2010 Judt wrote a short article about his condition, {{the first of a}} series of memoirs published in the New York Review of Books. In March 2010, Judt was interviewed by Terry Gross on NPR's <b>Fresh</b> <b>Air,</b> <b>and</b> in June he was interviewed by the BBC's disability affairs correspondent Peter White for the Radio 4 programme No Triumph, No Tragedy.|$|E

50|$|The {{climate of}} Gibraltar is Mediterranean/Subtropical with mild winters and warm summers. There {{are two main}} {{prevailing}} winds, an easterly one known as the Levante coming from the Sahara in Africa which brings humid weather and warmer sea currents and the other as Poniente which is westerly <b>and</b> brings <b>fresher</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> colder sea. Its terrain consists of the 430 m high Rock of Gibraltar and the narrow coastal lowland surrounding it. Rain occurs mainly in winter, the summers are generally dry.|$|R

25|$|Pets {{provide their}} owners (or guardians) {{physical}} and emotional benefits. Walking a dog can supply both the human and pet with exercise, <b>fresh</b> <b>air,</b> <b>and</b> social interaction. Pets can give companionship to elderly adults {{who do not have}} adequate social interaction with other people, as well as to other people who are living alone. There is a medically approved class of therapy animals, mostly dogs or cats, that are brought to visit confined humans, such as children in hospitals or elders in nursing homes. Pet therapy utilizes trained animals and handlers to achieve specific physical, social, cognitive, and emotional goals with patients.|$|E
25|$|In 1855 Osborn, who {{had been}} one of the charter {{officers}} of the Illinois Central two years earlier, visited the Highlands to take in the <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> scenic beauty of the area. He enjoyed his visit so much that he decided to buy the property where Castle Rock and its associated properties now stands. He and his family spent summers in Wing and Wing until the castle was completed the year before he retired from the railroad industry as president of the Chicago, St. Louis and New Orleans Railroad. He lived there until his death in 1894, devoting his time and money to philanthropic activities in New York.|$|E
25|$|It {{was found}} {{essential}} for recovery that the patients {{should get out}} into full daylight for <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> exercise, so the ground floor wards had 'airing courts' which were shared by the other wards upstairs. These were pleasantly laid out areas with seating and bounded by walls or railings. Some patients, well into their recovery, were allowed to walk {{and work in the}} surrounding fields. The asylum had its own carpentry, bakery and brewery along with many other services and was as self-sufficient as possible. The asylum paid the canal company for taking water from the canal and had its own dock to receive barges. This was very convenient for receiving coal deliveries, which was used not only for heating but for producing gas for lighting.|$|E

60|$|Certain {{lines on}} the broad {{forehead}} and about the lips might be taken to suggest that she had known moments of some difficulty and perplexity {{in the course of}} her career, but these had not destroyed her trustfulness, and she was clearly still prepared to give every one any number of fresh chances and the whole system the benefit of the doubt. She wore a great resemblance to her father, and suggested, as he did, the <b>fresh</b> <b>airs</b> <b>and</b> open spaces of a younger world.|$|R
25|$|Louis-Charles {{was then}} taken out for <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> walks {{on the roof}} of the Tower. From about the time of Gomin's arrival, he was inspected, not by delegates of the Commune, but by representatives of the civil {{committee}} of the 48 sections of Paris. The rare recurrence of the same inspectors would obviously facilitate fraud, if any such was intended. From the end of October onward, the child maintained an obstinate silence, explained by Laurent as a determination taken on the day he made his deposition against his mother. On 19 December 1794 he was visited by three commissioners from the Committee of Public Safety— J. B. Harmand de la Meuse, J. B. C. Mathieu and J. Reverchon— who extracted no word from him.|$|E
25|$|There {{was little}} {{development}} {{until the early}} 19th century, when Lawrence Palk, 2nd Baronet built a new harbour here. Much of the later building in the town was done by his solicitor, William Kitson, who {{was put in charge}} of the Palk estates in 1833. At this time the town started to attract visitors in ill health as a winter resort because of its <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> mild climate. Its population grew by over ten times in the first 50 years of the century. Later in the century, Torquay became a favoured resort for the upper classes. In 1870, Lawrence Palk, 1st Baron Haldon built another new harbour for the town which made it popular with yacht sailors. It was also extensively used for importing coal and wool from Australia.|$|E
25|$|Eccentric and opinionated, Thayer {{grew more}} so as he aged, and his family's manner of living {{reflected}} his strong beliefs: the Thayers typically slept outdoors year-round {{in order to}} enjoy the benefits of <b>fresh</b> <b>air,</b> <b>and</b> the three children were never enrolled in a school. The younger two, Gerald and Gladys, shared their father's enthusiasms, and became painters. In 1898, Thayer visited St Ives, Cornwall and, with an introductory letter from C. Hart Merrian, the Chief of the US Biological Survey in Washington, D.C., applied to {{the lord of the}} Manor of St Ives and Treloyhan, Henry Arthur Mornington Wellesley, the 3rd Earl Cowley, for permission to collect specimens of birds from the cliffs at St Ives. During this latter part of his life, among Thayer's neighbors was George de Forest Brush, with whom (when they were not quarreling) he collaborated on camouflage.|$|E
