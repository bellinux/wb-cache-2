Recently, many reports on antibody-coated bacteria (ACB) in urological diseases have been made. We performed ACB tests in 68 cases of urological infectious diseases. The tests were made according to Thomas' method. Anti-human immunoglobulin IgG, IgA, and IgM rabbit sera were used. The results were compared using the chi-square analysis. ACB-positive were 0 approximately 15 % of the cases of acute cystitis, 33 approximately 67 % of the cases of chronic cystitis, 30 approximately 60 % of the cases of prostatitis and urethritis, and 60 approximately 90 % of the cases of pyelonephritis. The percentage was higher in the patients who had <b>indwelling</b> <b>catheters</b> than in those who did not. The ACB test was suggested to be helpful in diagnosing upper urinary tract infection in the female patients {{who did not have}} <b>indwelling</b> <b>catheters.</b> But there was the danger of making an incorrect diagnosis with this test on male patients who had <b>indwelling</b> <b>catheters,</b> and those with prostatitis or urethritis, and on female patients with <b>indwelling</b> <b>catheters...</b>|$|R

50|$|In urinary {{catheterization}} a latex, polyurethane, or {{silicone tube}} {{known as a}} urinary catheter is inserted into a patient's bladder via the urethra.

A clinician, often a nurse, usually performs the procedure, but self-catheterization is also possible. The catheter may be a permanent one (<b>indwelling</b> <b>catheter),</b> or an intermittent catheter removed after each catheterization.|$|E

50|$|If an {{incontinence}} is due {{to overflow}} incontinence, in which the bladder never empties completely, or if the bladder cannot empty because of poor muscle tone, past surgery, or spinal cord injury, a catheter {{may be used to}} empty the bladder. A catheter is a tube that can be inserted through the urethra into the bladder to drain urine. Catheters may be used once in a while or on a constant basis, in which case the tube connects to a bag that is attached to the leg. If a long-term (or <b>indwelling)</b> <b>catheter</b> is used, urinary tract infections may occur.|$|E
50|$|Indwelling {{catheters}} (also {{known as}} foleys) are very {{often used in}} hospital settings or if the user {{is not able to}} handle any of the above solutions himself. The <b>indwelling</b> <b>catheter</b> is typically connected to a urine bag that can be worn on the leg or hang {{on the side of the}} bed. Indwelling catheters need to be changed on a regular basis by a health care professional. The advantage of indwelling catheters are, that the urine gets funneled away from the body keeping the skin dry. The disadvantage, however, is that it is very common to get urinary tract infections when using indwelling catheters.|$|E

5000|$|Catheters can be {{inserted}} into a body cavity, duct, or vessel. Functionally, they allow drainage, administration of fluids or gases, access by surgical instruments, and also perform {{a wide variety}} of other tasks {{depending on the type of}} catheter. The process of inserting a catheter is catheterization. In most uses, a catheter is a thin, flexible tube ("soft" [...] catheter) though catheters are available in varying levels of stiffness depending on the application. A catheter left inside the body, either temporarily or permanently, may be referred to as an <b>indwelling</b> <b>catheter</b> (for example, a peripherally inserted central catheter). A permanently inserted catheter may be referred to as a permcath (originally a trademark).|$|E
50|$|Intermittent {{catheters}} {{are used}} most frequently to treat DSD. The catheter {{is able to}} be inserted and removed from a person's bladder several times a day, {{so it is not}} permanently installed. This is to help people who struggle to empty their bladder. It is recommended that a person does not empty their bladder until a catheter is installed and stabilized. By having the catheter, the goal is to help reduce spasms within the sphincter. Ultrasound can be used to help track how effective the use of the catheter is. If a person struggles with using an intermittent catheter, than an <b>indwelling</b> <b>catheter</b> can be used instead. The indwelling has the same function, however it is designed to remain in the bladder.|$|E
5000|$|When an {{infection}} caused by P. oryzihabitans {{was reported in}} a patient with AIDS and an <b>indwelling</b> <b>catheter,</b> scientists took samples from the man's home to see where these bacteria were located {{and to find out}} a possible explanation for his infection. The patient claimed that he followed the strict hygienic guidelines pertaining to catheters, so an environmental factor is responsible for the infection. They ended up tracing the origin of the bacteria to a bath sponge. In order for researchers to validate these findings, they also tested bath sponges from other households and found P. oryzihabitans in some separate samples as well. [...] This suggests that the water could be contaminated with these bacteria, which in turn, could lead to potential infections in certain individuals.|$|E
