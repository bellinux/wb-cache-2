25|$|Economist Martin Wolf {{explained}} in July 2012 that government <b>fiscal</b> <b>balance</b> {{is one of}} three major financial sectoral balances in the U.S. economy, the others being the foreign financial sector and the private financial sector.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between countries' <b>fiscal</b> <b>balances</b> and current accounts {{with an emphasis on}} the role of fiscal rules. The direct effect of fiscal policy on the current account via aggregate (import) demand is potentially amplified by indirect effects, materialising through interest rate effects and intergenerational transfers that reduce savings. On the other hand, the implied positive relation between <b>fiscal</b> and external <b>balances</b> is potentially attenuated by offsetting changes in savings through Ricardian equivalence considerations. We expect this attenuation effect to be stronger in countries with more stringent fiscal rules and test this hypothesis using a panel of 73 countries over the period 1985 - 2012. As with previous studies, we find a positive effect of <b>fiscal</b> <b>balances</b> on the current account, supporting the twin deficit hypothesis. However, the effect of <b>fiscal</b> <b>balances</b> on the current account depends on the stringency of <b>fiscal</b> (budget <b>balance</b> or debt) rules in place; it is reduced by one-third on average and virtually eliminated for countries with the most stringent fiscal rules. ...|$|R
40|$|Recent studies {{examining}} {{the relation between}} fiscal decentralization and consolidated government <b>fiscal</b> <b>balances</b> generally have not taken proper account {{of the extent of}} the independent taxing powers available to sub-national governments and thus have overstated the degree of effective revenue decentralization. Results from a panel regression study of 19 OECD member countries suggest that when the measure of fiscal decentralization is limited to the revenues over which sub-national governments have full autonomy, its impact on <b>fiscal</b> <b>balances</b> is not statistically significant. Accordingly, when accurately measured revenue decentralization appears to have had no negative impact on fiscal discipline. ...|$|R

2500|$|Social Security is {{a social}} {{insurance}} program officially called [...] "Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance" [...] (OASDI), in reference to its three components. It is primarily funded through a dedicated payroll tax of 12.4%. During 2016, total benefits of $910 billion were paid out, versus $882 billion in 2015, an increase of $28 billion or 3%. Social Security's total expenditures have exceeded its non-interest income since 2010. The deficit of non-interest income relative to cost was about $49 billion in 2010, $45 billion in 2011, and $55 billion in 2012. During 2010, an estimated 157 million people paid into the program and 54 million received benefits, roughly 2.91 workers per beneficiary. [...] Since the Greenspan Commission in the early 1980s, Social Security has cumulatively collected far more in payroll taxes dedicated to the program than it has paid out to recipients—nearly $2.6 trillion in 2010. This annual surplus is credited to Social Security trust funds that hold special non-marketable Treasury securities. This surplus amount is {{commonly referred to as}} the [...] "Social Security Trust Fund". The proceeds are paid into the U.S. Treasury where they may be used for other government purposes. Social Security spending will increase sharply over the next decades, largely due to the retirement of the baby boom generation. The number of program recipients is expected to increase from 44 million in 2010 to 73 million in 2030. Program spending is projected to rise from 4.8% of GDP in 2010 to 5.9% of GDP by 2030, where it will stabilize. The Social Security Administration projects that an increase in payroll taxes equivalent to 1.8% of the payroll tax base or 0.6% of GDP would be necessary to put the Social Security program in <b>fiscal</b> <b>balance</b> for the next 75 years. Over an infinite time horizon, these shortfalls average 3.3% of the payroll tax base and 1.2% of GDP. Various reforms have been debated for Social Security. Examples include reducing future annual cost of living adjustments (COLA) provided to recipients, raising the retirement age, and raising the income limit subject to the payroll tax ($118,500 in 2014). Because of the mandatory nature of the program and large accumulated surplus in the Social Security Trust Fund, the Social Security system has the legal authority to compel the government to borrow to pay all promised benefits through 2036, when the Trust Fund is expected to be exhausted. Thereafter, the program under current law will pay approximately 75–78% of promised benefits {{for the remainder of the}} century.|$|E

In fact, a few {{government}}s (Central government included) have gone ahead and proclaimed that they have already initiated SGR.

Generally, {{it is not even}} spelt out exactly what constitutes the SGR that are being ushered in. From {{the point of view of}} the State governments, government finances seem to be the most relevant and essential component of FGR, since for the economy as a whole, it is stability in the <b>fiscal</b> <b>balances</b> of all levels of government that is crucial. This necessarily implies that as far as FGR are concerned, the very least that State governments should aim for is to set their <b>fiscal</b> <b>balances</b> in order.

A total of five alternative growth paths and sensitivity tests are presented.

40|$|The article reveàls {{the process}} of fiscal {{stabilization}} and optimization following the serious fiscal and economic crisis that Bulgaria experienced in the period between 1996 and 1997. The currency board was introduced and Bulgaria started pursuing fiscal stabilization {{within the framework of}} cyclically <b>balanced</b> budget <b>fiscal</b> policy. Fiscal stabilization has been achieved largely due to retaining and rationalizing the budget expenditures in years of economic growth and increasing the tax revenues. Reforms in taxation, budget policy and partly in the social security system and healthcare contributed to the optimization of <b>fiscal</b> <b>balances.</b> Furthermore, the established fiscal rules have created fiscal discipline and supported fiscal stabilization. Due to this type of policy, the country weathered the economic crisis of 2009 - 2011 without worsening <b>fiscal</b> <b>balances.</b> In 2011 the counry prepared a Fiscal Constitution, but finally adopted the new Public Finance Law, which incorporated a number of fiscal rules, preventing shortterm ineffective discretionary political decisions.

30|$|We {{find that}} {{measures}} decreasing the policy-induced outside option of workers, {{such as a}} cut in unemployment benefits or public wages, {{seems to be the}} most effective way to increase output, employment and international competitiveness while, at the same time, improving <b>fiscal</b> <b>balances.</b> The reason is that the effect on the reservation wage feeds through to private-sector wage bargaining almost immediately, while, at the same time, <b>fiscal</b> <b>balances</b> are also directly affected. The same argument holds for cuts in public-sector employment, albeit at a lower level, because the increase in private labor demand cannot compensate for the loss in public-sector employment. Cuts in the unions’ bargaining power also achieve the goal of improving competitiveness, output and employment, however, at a lower level. A cut in employment protection does not seem to be an adequate measure to regain international competitiveness. Lower employment protection yields less job security, which may induce workers to demand even higher wages, thereby deteriorating international competitiveness rather than improving it.|$|R
