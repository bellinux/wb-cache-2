5000|$|An {{integral}} term increases {{action in}} relation {{not only to}} the error but also the time for which it has persisted. So, if applied force is not enough to bring the error to zero, this force will be increased as time passes. A pure [...] "I" [...] controller could bring the error to zero, however, it would be both slow reacting at the start (because action would be small at the beginning, needing time to get significant), brutal (the action increases as long as the error is positive, even if the error has started to approach zero), and slow to end (when the error switches sides, this for some time will only reduce the strength of the action from [...] "I", not make it switch sides as well), prompting overshoot and oscillations (see below). Moreover, it could even move the system out of zero error: remembering that the system had been in error, it could prompt an action when not needed.An alternative formulation of <b>integral</b> <b>action</b> is to change the electric current in small persistent steps that are proportional to the current error.

40|$|Abstract: In {{this work}} it is {{described}} some practical aspects of PI(D) controllers regarding to conditional integration {{as an alternative}} to classical reset windup. This contribution concerns to the <b>integral</b> <b>action,</b> which is managed as function of control error sign. The effect due to the action of reset to zero or clear <b>integral</b> <b>action</b> when sign error changes, is a drastic reduction in response overshoot to command inputs for a special type of common industrial control systems among which, are ship steering control. Such strategy take advantages over conventional reset windup of PI(D) controllers in some applications such as feedback control of second order processes with at least, one of the dominant roots located at the origin of complex plane.
