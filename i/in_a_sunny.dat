5|$|A fast-growing and {{attractive}} plant, Banksia speciosa grows readily <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sunny</b> location in dry climates on well-drained soil, but does poorly {{in areas of}} humid summer climate, such as Australia's east coast. It has been grafted successfully onto Banksia serrata and B.integrifolia to enable cultivation in these areas. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 27 to 41 days to germinate. A specimen flowered in a greenhouse in the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh in 1830. Banksia speciosa is an important cut flower crop. It {{was one of several}} species considered for commercial cropping in Tenerife, and trials showed that seedlings were moderately tolerant to salinity.|$|E
5|$|A {{long-lived}} plant {{reaching an}} age of up to 60 years, I.anemonifolius resprouts from its woody base, known as a lignotuber, after bushfire. Seedlings appear in the year following a fire. Although I.anemonifolius was collected by Daniel Solander in 1770, it was not described until 1796 by Richard Salisbury. Several varieties have been named, though none are now recognised as distinct. It was first cultivated in the United Kingdom in 1791. I.anemonifolius grows readily in the garden if located <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sunny</b> or part-shaded spot with sandy soil and good drainage.|$|E

5|$|Collected and {{described}} by Robert Brown {{in the early}} 19th century, Banksia coccinea appears to be most closely related to Banksia speciosa and B.baxteri. Banksia coccinea plants are killed by bushfire, and regenerate from seed. The flowers attract nectar- and insect-feeding birds, particularly honeyeaters, {{and a variety of}} insects. Widely {{considered one of the most}} attractive Banksia species, B.coccinea is a popular garden plant and one of the most important Banksia species for the cut flower industry; it is grown commercially in several countries including Australia, South Africa, Canada, the United States, New Zealand and Israel. In cultivation, B.coccinea grows well <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sunny</b> location on well-drained soil, but it cannot survive in areas with humid or wet summers.|$|E
5|$|Collected and {{described}} by Robert Brown {{in the early}} 19th century, Banksia speciosa is classified in the series Banksia within the genus. Its closest relative is B. baxteri.

In cultivation, Banksia speciosa grows well <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sunny</b> location on well-drained soil in areas with dry summers.

5|$|It was {{conceived}} and produced by Coldplay. Originally, {{it had been}} intended for the whole band {{to appear in the}} video, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sunny</b> setting. Champion's mother's funeral was held {{on the day of the}} shooting, so it was decided that only Martin would appear in the video, which was also the immediate explanation of his mood during this part. The weather also opposed the original plan, with harsh winds and rain instead of the sunny day that had been envisioned. It had also been originally intended for there to be moving stars in the sky, as if in a time-lapse. The directors agreed that the moving stars would distract the focus of the video from Martin. The plan of time advancing was kept. The video begins with the beach being somewhat dark until sunlight arrives nearly at the video's midway point.|$|E

25|$|It prefers heavy, gravelly {{soil with}} {{excellent}} drainage, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sunny</b> position. It is drought tolerant, and frost tolerant down to -7°C. Plants become straggly and untidy with age, so should be pruned when young. Propagation is by seed, as the hairy stems of this plant make it {{virtually impossible to}} strike stem cuttings, and heel cuttings have been met with limited success. Germination takes three to four weeks, and has an excellent success rate. Flowering usually begins at {{three to four years}} from seed.|$|E
25|$|The bearded irises {{are easy}} to {{cultivate}} and propagate and have become very popular in gardens. A small selection is usually held by garden centres at appropriate times during the season, but {{there are thousands of}} cultivars available from specialist suppliers (more than 30 000 cultivars only for the tall bearded irises !). They are best planted as bare root plants in late summer, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sunny</b> open position with the rhizome visible {{on the surface of the}} soil and facing the sun. They should be divided in summer every two or three years, when the clumps become congested.|$|E
25|$|Several {{variations}} of turtle racing exist. While turtle racing typically {{takes place on}} land, turtle races have occasionally occurred in pools as well. Some races begin with the turtles racing from a starting location and end when they reach a designated finish line. Outdoor races occasionally start the turtles <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sunny</b> spot near a shaded area and the turtles by nature race into the shade. Other races begin with the turtles all being placed {{in the center of}} a large circle, the first to pass outside of the circle is deemed the winner. In some cases, a large lid is placed on top of the turtles before the race and the race begins when the lid is lifted off of them. The turtles are often distinguished by numbers painted or taped on their shells.|$|E

25|$|The Solar Water Purifier, {{developed}} and manufactured by an Australian company, is a low-maintenance, low operational cost solution that {{is able to}} purify large amounts of water, even seawater, to levels better than human consumption standards set by the World Health Organization. This device works through the processes of evaporation and UV radiation. Light passes through {{the top layer of}} glass to the black plastic layer underneath. Heat from the solar radiation is trapped by the water and by the black plastic. This plastic layer is a series of connected troughs that separate the water as it evaporates and trickles down through the levels. The water is also subjected to UV radiation {{for an extended period of}} time as it moves through the device, which kills many bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>sunny,</b> equatorial area like much of Africa, this device is capable of purifying up to 45 litres per day from a single array. Additional arrays may be chained together for more capacity.|$|E
25|$|Using {{this measure}} of {{investment}} in carnivory, a model can be proposed. Above is a graph of carbon dioxide uptake (potential for growth) against trap respiration (investment in carnivory) for a leaf <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sunny</b> habitat containing no soil nutrients at all. Respiration is a straight line sloping down under the horizontal axis (respiration produces carbon dioxide). Gross photosynthesis is a curved line above the horizontal axis: as investment increases, so too does the photosynthesis of the trap, as the leaf receives a better supply of nitrogen and phosphorus. Eventually another factor (such as light intensity or carbon dioxide concentration) will become more limiting to photosynthesis than nitrogen or phosphorus supply. As a result, increasing the investment will not make the plant grow better. The net uptake of carbon dioxide, and therefore, the plant's potential for growth, must be positive for the plant to survive. There is a broad span of investment where this is the case, {{and there is also}} a non-zero optimum. Plants investing more or less than this optimum will take up less carbon dioxide than an optimal plant, and hence growing less well. These plants will be at a selective disadvantage. At zero investment the growth is zero, because a non-carnivorous plant cannot survive in a habitat with absolutely no soil-borne nutrients. Such habitats do not exist, so for example, Sphagnum absorbs the tiny amounts of nitrates and phosphates in rain very efficiently and also forms symbioses with diazotrophic cyanobacteria.|$|E
