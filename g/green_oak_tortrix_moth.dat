40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{evaluate}} historical human impact on the expansion of European oak stands in the past through scientific publications and to find existing limitations that affect the oak recovery ability. The European historical forest is characterized by coppicing, of which origins {{date back to the}} Neolithic period. The coppice featured vegetative renewal, in the coppice with standards there were left standards of the generative origin, often oaks. Both forms have a very long tradition in European countries. People used the sprouting capacity and the quick regeneration of oak especially for construction purposes and their need for firewood. Acorns secured the source of food for pig farming. Based on for example the ring width or pollen analysis, current methods of research permit {{to assess the impact of}} active management on the oak stands and outline the structure of primeval forests. It turned out that coppicing has a positive effect on the increment of oak standards and that the open landscape with a rich diversity of species, which features a picture of a primeval forest, was always maintained especially by a man starting forest fires. Since the mid- 20 th century, it was gradually transferred to the high shape of the wood, which favors generative way to recovery, and thus monocultures of often coniferous trees are created. Oak is currently health endangered tree species and its recovery is negatively affected by grazing deer (browsing), the influence of abrupt climate change, weed, pathogenic fungi of the genus Phytophthora, oak powdery mildew (Microsphaera alphitoides), tracheomycotic diseases or larvae of winter moth (Operophtera Brumata) and <b>green</b> <b>oak</b> <b>moth</b> (<b>Tortrix</b> viridana). Finally, it is inappropriately selected management that is not based on the rich history of this species and doesn´t preserve its characteristic natural properties...|$|R

40|$|Although most ecologists {{agree that}} both {{top-down}} and bottom-up forces (predation and resource limitation, respectively) act in concert to influence populations of herbivores, it has proven difficult {{to estimate the}} relative contributions of such forces in terrestrial systems. Using a combination of time–series analysis of population counts recorded over 16 years and experimental data, we present the first estimates of the relative roles of top-down and bottom-up forces on the population dynamics of two terrestrial insect herbivores on the English oak (Quercus robur). Data suggest that temporal variation in winter moth, Operophtera brumata, density is dominated by time-lagged effects of pupal predators. By comparison, spatial variation in O. brumata density is dominated by host–plant quality. Overall, top-down forces explain 34. 2 % of population variance, bottom-up forces explain 17. 2 % of population variance, and 48. 6 % remains unexplained. In contrast, populations of the <b>green</b> <b>oak</b> <b>tortrix,</b> Tortrix viridana, appear dominated by bottom-up forces. Resource limitation, expressed as intraspecific competition among larvae for oak leaves, explains 29. 4 % of population variance. Host quality effects explain an additional 5. 7 % of population variance. We detected no major top-down effects on T. viridana populations. An unknown factor causing a linear decline in T. viridana populations over the 16 -year study period accounts {{for most of the}} remaining unexplained variance. We discuss the observed differences between the insect species and the utility of time–series analysis as a tool in assessing the relative importance of top-down and bottom-up forces on herbivore populations...|$|R

40|$|Recently out-breaks of the <b>green</b> <b>oak</b> {{leaf roller}} <b>Tortrix</b> viridana L. (Lepidoptera, Tortricidae) were {{recorded}} in Natural Reserve in Sicily (Italy) where treatments are generally forbidden. The commercial, social and environmental value of the wood in the forest needs to be preserved and biological control could be applied in particular case. To optimise the permitted biological treatment, {{not only in terms}} of product amount but also for the time of application baseline susceptibility of T. viridiana from the Natural Reserve of Ficuzza (Palermo, Italy) to a commercial formulation of Bacillus thuringiensis was determined for neonates and 2, 5, 10 and 15 day old larvae. The differences in susceptibility of the different larval development were recorded. For neonates the calculated DL 50 was 0. 63 μg/ml, while after five days it was 10. 01 μg/ml. The same doses had little effect on the older larvae, showing a clear decrease in susceptibility with age and larval growth. A relationship was also found between susceptibility and body length. The implications of these data in controlling this pest in the natural reserve are discussed...|$|R
