5|$|Władysław IV Vasa, son of Sigismund III, {{ruled the}} Commonwealth during 1632–1648. Born {{and raised in}} Poland, {{prepared}} for the office from the early years, popular, educated, free of his father's religious prejudices, <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> promising chief executive candidate. Władysław however, like his father, had the life ambition of attaining the Swedish throne by using his royal status and power in Poland and Lithuania, which, to serve his purpose, he attempted to strengthen. Władysław ruled {{with the help of}} several prominent magnates, among them Jerzy Ossoliński, Chancellor of the Crown, Hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski, and Jakub Sobieski, the middle szlachta leader. Władysław IV was unable to attract a wider szlachta following, and many of his plans had foundered because of lack of support in the increasingly ineffectual sejm. Because of his tolerance for non-Catholics, Władysław was also opposed by the Catholic clergy and the papacy.|$|E
25|$|Following {{deposition}} of Rodezno Arellano continued as {{a rising star}} in the movement; despite his status of Rodezno's companion, he remained on good terms with the Carlist leader Fal Conde. As part of re-modeling of the party command structures, in 1934 Arellano was appointed jefe of the newly created Youth Section; initially he controlled Juventud Tradicionalista, student AET and paramilitary Requeté organizations, though there was another separate section soon created for the militia later on. At that time <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> bit of a pivotal figure, in-between possibilist Rodezno's strategy and the intransigence of Fal. He continued within Bloque Nacional until Fal ordered termination of the alliance. By some scholars he is quoted as a speaker endorsing violent subversive anti-Republican strategy and contributing to belligerent spirit; others consider him representative of the new Carlist generation, already inclined towards authoritarism. In 1936 he was re-elected to the Cortes from the same Navarrese constituency.|$|E
500|$|During Bomar's {{senior season}} (when {{he moved to}} halfback), the Commodores tied the Quantico Marines 13–13. Bomar, picking up a fumble, ran 84 yards for a touchdown. According to a {{newspaper}} account, [...] "It was Lynn Bomar's gigantic figure that broke up {{what looked like a}} Marine cakewalk. After receiving the kickoff, the Marines drove steadily to Vanderbilt's 10-yard line as Goettge repeatedly completed short passes. At the 10, Groves dropped back. The pass from center was low. He missed it. He reached for the ball. It trickled off his fingers. The Commodores were boring in. Wakefield was in there. Then Bomar came charging through. He picked up the ball and with a twist was out of Groves' grasp. He came out of the bunch with a long, charging run. Then <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> little undecided. One fleeting glance behind him and he struck out. Up came his free arm to brush off his headgear. His thin, yellow hair stood out. On he swept like a thundercloud of vengeance across the goal. Bedlam broke loose." [...] Captain and guard Tuck Kelly was injured during the game, making Bomar the interim captain two weeks later against the Georgia Bulldogs.|$|E

500|$|Just Fontaine, French striker {{and leading}} scorer at the 1958 World Cup; [...] "When I saw Pelé play, {{it made me}} feel I should hang up my boots." [...] England's 1966 FIFA World Cup-winning captain Bobby Moore commented: [...] "Pelé was the most {{complete}} player I've ever seen, he had everything. Two good feet. Magic in the air. Quick. Powerful. Could beat people with skill. Could outrun people. Only five feet and eight inches tall, yet <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> giant of an athlete on the pitch. Perfect balance and impossible vision. He was the greatest because he could do anything and everything on a football pitch. I remember Saldhana the coach being asked by a Brazilian journalist who was the best goalkeeper in his squad. He said Pelé. The man could play in any position". Former Manchester United striker and member of England's 1966 FIFA World Cup-winning team Sir Bobby Charlton stated; [...] "I sometimes feel as though football was invented for this magical player." [...] During the 1970 World Cup, a British television commentator asked; [...] "How do you spell Pelé?", with the response; [...] "Easy: G-O-D." ...|$|E
2500|$|By the 1950s, Armstrong was {{a widely}} beloved American icon and {{cultural}} ambassador who commanded an international fanbase. However, a growing generation gap became apparent {{between him and}} the young jazz musicians who emerged in the postwar era such as Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, and Sonny Rollins. The postwar generation regarded their music as abstract art and considered Armstrong's vaudevillian style, half-musician and half-stage entertainer, outmoded and Uncle Tomism, [...] "[...] <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> link to minstrelsy that we were ashamed of." [...] He described [...] as [...] "Chinese music." [...] While touring Australia, 1954, he was asked if he could play Bebop. [...] "Bebop?" [...] he husked. [...] "I just play music. Guys who invent terms like that are walking the streets with their instruments under their arms [...] " ...|$|E

6000|$|... "By {{all means}} I should ask him. <b>He</b> <b>seems</b> <b>an</b> {{extraordinarily}} learned man in Egyptology; and <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> to me <b>a</b> good fellow {{as well as}} an enthusiast.

2500|$|The Pastoral Concert {{is one of}} a {{small group}} of paintings, {{including}} the Virgin and Child with Saint Anthony and Saint Roch in the Prado, which are very close in style and, according to Charles Hope, have been [...] "more and more frequently given to Titian, not so much because of any very compelling resemblance to his undisputed early works—which would surely have been noted before—as because <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> less implausible candidate than Giorgione. But no one has been able to create a coherent sequence of Titian's early works that includes these ones, in a way that commands general support, and fits the known facts of his career. An alternative proposal is to assign the Pastoral Concert and the other pictures like it to a third artist, the very obscure Domenico Mancini..". While Crowe and Cavalcaselle considered the Concert from Palazzo Pitti as Giorgione's masterpiece but disattributed Louvre's Pastoral Concert, Lermolieff reinstated the Pastoral Concert and claimed instead that the Pitti Concert was by Titian.|$|E

6000|$|He stopped hopelessly. The man's tone tickled me. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>an</b> odd character. [...] "I am," [...] he said, [...] "one of {{the most}} unfortunate beings alive." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I only meant," [...] {{he replied}} hastily, [...] "that <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> thought rash in conferring the honour {{of his company}} on those who desire it not." ...|$|R
60|$|Indeed, as he eagerly sparkled at {{them from}} the {{cellarage}} before mentioned, <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> kind of cannon loaded to the muzzle with facts, and prepared to blow them clean out of the regions of childhood at one discharge. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> galvanizing apparatus, too, charged with a grim mechanical substitute for the tender young imaginations that were to be stormed away.|$|E
60|$|Durade laughed. He {{had indeed}} changed. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> weaker man. Benton was acting powerfully upon him.|$|E
