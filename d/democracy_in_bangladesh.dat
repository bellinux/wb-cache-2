This paper examines the impact of democracy on economic growth <b>in</b> <b>Bangladesh</b> using a cointegrated Vector Autoregressive model. Results suggest that <b>democracy</b> as practiced <b>in</b> <b>Bangladesh</b> {{does not seem to have}} a significantly positive impact on economic growth, and at the same time authoritarian regimes tend to have a significantly negative impact on economic growth. Inadequate democratic decision making practices, ineffective policy designs and weak policy making institutions are some of the likely causes behind this relationship. The situation is aggravated by the fact that the institutions do not positively alter the decision making behaviour even under democratically elected regimes. ...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the first}} {{scholarly}} work in the Western academy to document from primary intelligence sources hitherto unavailable the use of intelligence agencies by states taking over from the Raj and involves {{a study of the}} contemporary secret service communities of Bangladesh, Pakistan and India. Intelligence agencies have actually {{played a significant role in}} the subcontinent in forming new states, in sustaining weak states, and <b>in</b> <b>Bangladesh’s</b> case, strengthening states born from secession. The evolution of the state from East Pakistan to contemporary Bangladesh is part of a much wider picture of how national intelligence machinery equally evolved, to be used and abused by governments in the course of nation building in weak and incomplete post-colonial states conforming to a Westphalian system. The first account of the role of intelligence agencies in East Pakistan confirms that the continuous denial of Bengali agency in the Pakistan enterprise and recourse to intrigue, coercion and force led to the break-up of Pakistan and the emergence of Bangladesh as an independent state in 1971. The study supports the view that intelligence operations in South Asia have been dominated by covert action, counter-insurgency and clandestine wars, identifiable in Indian intelligence support to the Bangladesh independence movement and later in their sponsoring the insurgency <b>in</b> <b>Bangladesh’s</b> Chittagong Hill Tracts. With the very first literature on Bangladesh’s intelligence community and its role in the evolution of the state from post-revolution anarchy to parliamentary politics the research follows the Mujib phase, through the military-bureaucratic period of the Zia and Ershad regimes, and concludes with the era of <b>democracy</b> <b>in</b> contemporary <b>Bangladesh.</b> Bangladesh’s national intelligence machinery has evolved in correspondence with the progress in strength and stability of the state and civil-military relations, and has been used by every type of government to maintain absolute power and political security.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{efforts have been}} made to improve {{governance}} by ensuring institutional performance and policing for greater transparency to sustain liberal <b>democracy</b> <b>in</b> <b>Bangladesh</b> and elsewhere. Since gaining independence in 1971, The People’s Republic of Bangladesh has been driven by internal power struggles and economic chaos, while attempting to develop a democratic society. A predominately Islamic country, Bangladesh’s representative government is battling poverty and rampant corruption. Although this study appreciates what Bangladesh has achieved so far, it seeks to deviate from the general trend that romanticizes Bangladesh’s democracy and its recent connection with new governance parameters. This study attempts to identify some of the major paradoxes that Bangladesh’s democracy is faced with.

40|$|First of all, {{this paper}} explores the {{rationale}} for internal party democracy, highlighting the ‘school for democracy’ argument.

Third, the quality of intra-party <b>democracy</b> <b>in</b> <b>Bangladesh</b> is analysed in terms of party leadership selection and the pre-valent practice of dynastic rule. The overall finding is {{that the degree of}} internal democracy of political parties in Bangla-desh is weak, due to the electoral parties ’ weak organizations, strong centralization and prevalent informal decision-making processes controlled by a limited number of party elites (dynastic parties).

It further argues that whatever the limitations and excesses of democracy, army rule is no solution, rather it is necessary to strengthen democractic institutions and let democratic processes play themselves out. In this sense, the recourse to the army to bring in <b>democracy</b> <b>in</b> <b>Bangladesh</b> was not the best solution to the political impasse witnessed in 2007. ...|$|E
