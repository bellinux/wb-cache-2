25|$|In 1937, Ture Nerman and {{his friend}} August Spångberg, {{traveled}} to Spain where General Francisco Franco's National faction had taken power and a civil war was ravaging the country. They went through Nazi Germany and managed to get to Barcelona. The civil war was a chaos. At times the Stalinists were fighting the Trotskyists, {{and at other times}} the Anarchists were fighting everyone, and the Nationalists benefited from the turmoil within the left. Ture Nerman decided he could not side with any of the groups, all he <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he was an anti-fascist.|$|E
500|$|Malone {{credited}} Howarth's versatility {{with the}} reason he was cast as Todd. [...] During a February 1993 interview with Soap Opera Digest (SOD), Howarth stated he was surprised he won the part. [...] "I really don't know how I made it," [...] he said. He met a One Life to Live casting director two years previously, while performing in a New York play, but, when the role of Todd opened up, he [...] "auditioned just like everybody else". He [...] "made it to callbacks, and [...] got the part". Howarth said, [...] "I was hired... to plant drugs in Jason Webb's jacket. All I <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> my first name was Todd. I don't know what happened next. They called me in again and suddenly I had a last name 'Manning.' Then I get called to read another day." ...|$|E
2500|$|Up to {{this point}} the {{fighting}} for Huế had been entirely a South Vietnamese affair. Brigadier General LaHue, the Task Force X-Ray commander, actually had very little reliable intelligence on the situation. All he <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Truong's headquarters had been under attack, as was the MACV Compound. Because of enemy mortaring of the LCU ramp in southern Huế, the allies had stopped all river traffic to the city. As LaHue later wrote: [...] "Initial deployment of forces was made with limited information." ...|$|E

2500|$|Buck himself sized up CBS' {{handling}} of the announcers by saying [...] "CBS never got that baseball play-by-play draws word-pictures. All they <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> football stars analysts. So they said, 'Let [...] McCarver run the show.' In television, all {{they want you to}} do is shut up. I'm not very good at shutting up." [...] Buck though, would add that although he knew Tim McCarver well, they never developed a good relationship with each other on the air despite high hopes to the contrary. Phil Mushnick added insult to injury to Buck by accusing him of [...] "trying to predict plays, as if to prove he was still on top." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{two years}} of calling {{baseball}} telecasts (including the Saturday afternoon Game of the Week, All-Star Game, National League Championship Series, and World Series), Buck was dismissed by CBS. The official reasoning behind Buck's ouster was that he simply had poor chemistry with lead analyst Tim McCarver. Buck was soon replaced by Boston Red Sox announcer Sean McDonough. Buck later noted that [...] "CBS never got that baseball play-by-play draws word-pictures. All they <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> football stars analysts. So they said, 'Let McCarver run the show ... In television, all {{they want you to}} do is shut up. I'm not very good at shutting up." [...] Buck was criticized by some for his alleged habit of predicting plays on air.|$|E
2500|$|Banjee. That was the {{identity}} I was given {{back in the}} summer of 1991, when I, half out/half in approached the colored museum of the Christopher Street piers. I was new to the life, so I had no reference for what people were talking about, but I soon gathered that [...] "banjee" [...] meant that I wasn't a [...] "queen." [...] Whatever the terms of identification, all I <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> there was one thing that brought both the banjees and the queens (and whatever lies between) to the pier: we were men who loved men. An anxious 19 year old, I wore my banjee realness designation like a badge of honor. [...] a queen schooled me on how my masculinity was something that carried great weight, not only in the gay world, but the straight world as well.|$|E

2500|$|Vera {{asked if}} there was {{anything}} she could do to help with family matters. Inayat Khan said that, should she go missing, she would like Vera to avoid worrying her mother as far as possible. The normal procedure, as Inayat Khan <b>knew,</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> when an agent went to the field, Vera would send out a periodic [...] "good news" [...] letters to the family, letting them know the person concerned was well. If the agent went missing, the family would be told so. What Inayat Khan was suggesting was that bad news should be broken to her mother only if it was beyond any doubt that she was dead. Vera said she would agree to this arrangement if it was what she wanted. With this assurance Inayat Khan seemed content and confident once more. Any doubts in Vera's mind were also now settled.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a teacher}} of Christian Science, Rathvon was {{required}} to organize an association of his students for whose training and support his was a lifelong commitment and for whom he was required hold an annual reunion at which time he was also required to give an annual address. [...] Typically, a Christian Science teacher's association survives them and continues to meet annually for many years. [...] Surviving for many years after Rathvon died in 1939, his association of students continued to distribute copies of this recording for many years. Some recordings invariably {{ended up in the}} estates of deceased students whose families had no information on the original source of the recording. The recording that was sent to National Public Radio was just such a recording and the family had lost track of the story behind it. All the family <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> they had in their possession a recording by a man named Rathvon who claimed to have heard Lincoln give his Gettysburg Address. Because a number of copies of the recording exist, it continues to surface {{from time to time and}} be [...] "rediscovered." ...|$|E

Motherland was {{revealed to be}} a 12-track album and when asked why is it taking so long? she commented [...] "One needs to take one's time because good work takes time. But it must be worth the wait in the end." [...] At the 4th City People Awards, 14 July 2013, she lost South South Musician of the Year to fellow Rivers State recording artist Oba Omega; present at the occasion were the celebrities Rita Dominic and Yvonne Nelson from Ghana.

It was also made known on 23 September 2013, that Muma Gee has commenced a new recording session—possibly for Motherland—with Slim Burna and P Jaydino in the studio. On 15 February 2014, whilst heavily pregnant with her first child, she confirmed {{in a telephone interview}} with Saturday Beats of The Punch that she will be performing at the album launch party for Motherland regardless of her physical condition. On 18 April, just weeks before the anticipated concert, Uwame delivered twins – {{a boy and a girl}} commenting on this Uwame said, [...] "I was not initially expecting twins. All I <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> I started getting big and bigger. And people would see me and say, oh, you are looking so beautiful. I didn't believe I was going to have twins." ...|$|E
