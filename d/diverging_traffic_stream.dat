External factors including road geometry, time of day and environmental conditions, was also included in the model, since these factors alone can affect driver behavior. Lee et al. [10 – 13] found that freeway segments with merging or <b>diverging</b> <b>traffic</b> contribute more to crash potential than straight freeway segments with no changes in lane configuration. Time of day refers to peak and off-peak periods. Typically, traffic volumes and congestion are higher during peak periods and drivers, particularly commuters, may react more aggressively to maintain their schedules. These factors are likely to increase the likelihood of a crash occurrence during the peak periods. Lastly, environmental conditions include such factors as local weather, road surface quality, and lighting. Due to the limited amount of available environmental data, the effect of these factors can be difficult to capture.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new class of traffic {{profiles}} that is better suited for metering bursty Internet <b>traffic</b> <b>streams</b> than the traditional token bucket profile. A good traffic profile should satisfy two criteria: first, it should consider packets from a conforming <b>traffic</b> <b>stream</b> as in profile with high probability to ensure a strong QoS guarantee; second, it should limit the network resources consumed by a non-conforming <b>traffic</b> <b>stream</b> to no more than that consumed by a conforming stream. We model a bursty Internet <b>traffic</b> <b>stream</b> as an ON/OFF stream, where both the ON-period and the OFF-period have a heavy-tailed distribution. Our study shows that the heavy-tailed distribution leads to an excessive randomness in the long-term session rate distribution. Therefore, it is inherently difficult for any profile that limits the long-term average session rate to give a strong QoS guarantee for the conforming <b>traffic</b> <b>streams.</b> Our simulation demonstrates that a token bucket profile that couples the average rate control and the burst size control has a weak QoS guarantee. Based on this result, we propose {{a new class}} of traffic profiles that decouples the long term average rate control from the burst size control.

The WDM network is based on a passive star coupler, and the purpose of integrating different MAC protocols is to efficiently accommodate various types of multimedia <b>traffic</b> <b>streams</b> with different characteristics and quality of service demands. Our integrated MAC protocol is termed multimedia wavelength-division multiple-access (M-WDMA). Three types of multimedia <b>traffic</b> <b>streams</b> are considered in this paper: constant-bit-rate traffic and, two classes of variable-bit-rate traffic. Accordingly, three tunable transmitters and one fixed home channel receiver are used in the design of each WDM node. The transmitters transmit the three types of multimedia <b>traffic</b> <b>streams</b> in a pipeline fashion so as to overcome the tuning time overhead and to support para e transmissions of <b>traffic</b> <b>streams</b> that emerge simultaneously.
