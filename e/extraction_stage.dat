25|$|The UREX {{process is}} a PUREX process which has been {{modified}} to prevent the plutonium from being extracted. This {{can be done by}} adding a plutonium reductant before the first metal extraction step. In the UREX process, ~99.9% of the uranium and >95% of technetium are separated from each other and the other fission products and actinides. The key is the addition of acetohydroxamic acid (AHA) to the extraction and scrub sections of the process. The addition of AHA greatly diminishes the extractability of plutonium and neptunium, providing somewhat greater proliferation resistance than with the plutonium <b>extraction</b> <b>stage</b> of the PUREX process.|$|E

5000|$|The {{technique}} {{being evaluated}} uses voltammetric sensors combined in an electronic tongue {{to observe the}} antioxidant capacity in red wines. These Electronic Tongues (ETs) consist of multiple sensing units like voltammetric sensors, which will have unique responses to certain compounds. This approach is optimal to use since samples of high complexity can be analyzed with high cross-selectivity. Thus, the sensors can be sensitive to pH and antioxidants. As usual, the voltage in the cell was monitored using a working electrode and a reference electrode (Silver/Silver Chloride electrode). [...] Furthermore, a platinum counter electrode allows the current to continue to flow during the experiment. The Carbon Paste Electrodes sensor (CPE) and the Graphite-Epoxy Composite (GEC) electrode are tested in a saline solution before the scanning of the wine so that a reference signal can be obtained. The wines are then ready to be scanned, once with CPE and once with GEC. While cyclic voltammetry was successfully used to generate currents using the wine samples, the signals were complex and needed an additional <b>extraction</b> <b>stage.</b> [...] It {{was found that the}} ET method could successfully analyze wine’s antioxidant capacity as it agreed with traditional methods like TEAC, Folin-Ciocalteu, and I280 indexes. [...] Additionally, the time was reduced, the sample {{did not have to be}} pretreated, and other reagents were unnecessary, all of which diminshed the popularity of traditional methods. [...] Thus, cyclic voltammetry successfully determines the antioxidant capacity and even improves previous results.|$|E

However, the most noticeable modification was the formation of Calpha-oxidized syringyl lignin units in the enzymatic steps that were partially removed in the alkaline <b>extraction</b> <b>stages.</b> This study revealed that the first cycle of pretreatment of eucalypt with M. thermophila laccase and methyl syringate did not produce any delignification effect and consequently did not increase the saccharification yields.

40|$|Abstract — We {{present an}} {{evolutionary}} approach using multiobjective genetic programming to derive optimal feature <b>extraction</b> pre-processing <b>stages</b> for robot failure detection. This data-driven machine learning method is compared both with conventional (non-evolutionary) classifiers {{and a set}} of domain-dependent feature extraction methods. We conclude MOGP is an effective and practical design method for failure recognition systems with enhanced recognition accuracy over conventional classifiers, independent of domain knowledge. Note to Practitioners — Detecting failures in robotic systems is critical to their autonomous operation since it allows mitigating/compensating control strategies to be brought into play. In this paper we employ multiobjective genetic programming to derive (near-) optimal feature <b>extraction</b> <b>stages</b> for failure detection which we demonstrate to yield significantly better detection performance than a range of comparator methods on benchmark datasets.

But at the complete <b>extraction</b> <b>stage,</b> the periodical pressure from the main roof is mainly caused by the periodical broken, overturn and unstable arch beam roof in the regular caving zone. The strength of periodic pressure at the non-complete <b>extraction</b> <b>stage</b> is higher than that at the complete <b>extraction</b> <b>stage.</b> A case study on the roof movement of a LTCC face at the No. 4  mine in Yangquan, China, further described the roof movement at the two stages (Kang et al. 1997). Based on the movement characteristics of overlying strata at the LTCC face, Yan (1996) introduced a mechanical theory of limited deformation and proposed a balance structure of macro continuous “compressed arch beam” of overlying strata at the upper location.|$|E
