Using multimode phosphosilicate fibres pumped at 0.53 and 1.06 μm, {{they saw the}} normal Stokes components and a spectrum which extended from the ultraviolet to the near infrared. They calculated that the spectral broadening due to self-phase modulation should have been 910 cm−1, but their continuum was greater than 3000 cm−1. They concluded that [...] "an optical continuum cannot be explained by self-phase modulation alone." [...] They continued by pointing out the difficulties of phase-matching over long lengths of fibre to maintain <b>four</b> <b>wave</b> <b>mixing,</b> and reported an unusual damage mechanism (with hindsight this would probably be considered a very short fibre fuse). Interestingly, they note a much earlier suggestion by Loy and Shen that if the nanosecond pulses consisted of sub-nanosecond spikes in a nanosecond envelope, it would explain the broad continuum.|$|E

However it provides the possibility for gain in different wavelength regions from the EDFA. [...] "Linear optical amplifiers" [...] using gain-clamping techniques have been developed.|$|E
50|$|Using {{the same}} {{principles}} pioneered by 2D-NMR experiments, multidimensional optical spectroscopy is possible using ultrafast pulses. Different frequencies can probe various dynamic molecular processes to differentiate between inhomogeneous and homogeneous line broadening as well as identify coupling between the measured spectroscopic transitions. If two oscillators are coupled together, be it intramolecular vibrations or intermolecular electronic coupling, the added dimensionality will resolve anharmonic responses not identifiable in linear spectra. A typical 2D pulse sequence consists of an initial pulse to pump the system into coherent superposition of states, followed by a phase conjugate second pulse that pushes the system into a non-oscillating excited state, and finally, a third pulse that converts back to a coherent state that produces a measurable pulse. A 2D frequency spectrum can then be recorded by plotting the Fourier transform of the delay {{between the first and}} second pulses on one axis, and the Fourier transform of the delay between a detection pulse relative to the signal-producing third pulse on the other axis. 2D spectroscopy is an example of a <b>four</b> <b>wave</b> <b>mixing</b> experiment, and the wavevector of the signal will be the sum of the three incident wavevectors used in the pulse sequence. Multidimensional spectroscopy exist in infrared and visible variants as well as combinations using different wavelength regions.|$|E
50|$|The {{result of}} GVD, whether {{negative}} or positive, is ultimately temporal spreading of the pulse. This makes dispersion management extremely important in optical communications systems based on optical fiber, since if dispersion is too high, {{a group of}} pulses representing a bit-stream will spread in time and merge, rendering the bit-stream unintelligible. This limits the length of fiber that a signal can be sent down without regeneration. One possible answer to this problem is to send signals down the optical fibre at a wavelength where the GVD is zero (e.g., around 1.3-1.5 μm in silica fibres), so pulses at this wavelength suffer minimal spreading from dispersion. In practice, however, this approach causes more problems than it solves because zero GVD unacceptably amplifies other nonlinear effects (such as <b>four</b> <b>wave</b> <b>mixing).</b> Another possible option is to use soliton pulses in the regime of anomalous dispersion, a form of optical pulse which uses a nonlinear optical effect to self-maintain its shape. Solitons have the practical problem, however, that they require a certain power level to be maintained in the pulse for the nonlinear effect {{to be of the}} correct strength. Instead, the solution that is currently used in practice is to perform dispersion compensation, typically by matching the fiber with another fiber of opposite-sign dispersion so that the dispersion effects cancel; such compensation is ultimately limited by nonlinear effects such as self-phase modulation, which interact with dispersion to make it very difficult to undo.|$|E

In this paper, this fibre amplification device is included into a MOPFA laser, a master oscillator coupled with fibre amplifier, usually a cladding-pumped high-power amplifier often based on an ytterbium-doped fibre. An experimental study has established that the observed nonlinear effects (such as Kerr effect, <b>four</b> <b>waves</b> <b>mixing,</b> Raman effect) could behave very differently depending {{on the characteristics of}} the optical source emitted by the master laser. However, it has not been yet possible to determine from the experimental data if the statistics of the photons is alone responsible for the various nonlinear scenarios observed.

Degenerate <b>four</b> [...] <b>wave</b> <b>mixing</b> at near [...] infrared wavelengths demonstrates an almost dispersionless emission over a broad spectral range. Quantum kinetic theory is employed to estimate the magnitude of the response and is in good agreement with the experimental data. The large susceptibility enables high contrast imaging, with a monolayer flake contrast of the order 10 ^ 7 times higher than for standard reflection imaging. The degenerate <b>four</b> [...] <b>wave</b> <b>mixing</b> technique is utilised in Chapter 4 to measure the interface carbon signal of epitaxially grown graphene on silicon carbide.

Excluding the third [...] order emission from detection by elongating the emission to outside a band [...] pass filter range allows for pure interfacial luminescence imaging. Features within the two growth faces are investigated with Raman spectroscopy. Nonlinear measurements are an increasingly popular tool for investigating fundamental properties of graphene. Chapter 5 investigates the influence of ultrafast pulses on the nonlinear response of graphene. High instantaneous intensities at the sample are shown to reduce the nonlinear emission by a factor or two. Comparing the Raman peak positions, widths and intensities before and after irradiation points to a huge doping of the samples, of the order 500 meV. In Chapter 6 the relaxation of photoexcited carriers is measured via time [...] resolved pump [...] probe spectroscopy, where a layer dependence of hot phonon decay is observed. Single layer flakes are observed to relax faster than bilayers and trilayers, with an asymptote reached at approximately four layers.

The decay mechanism is therefore intrinsic to graphene, perhaps due to coupling to out [...] of [...] plane, flexural phonons. The thickness dependence of epitaxial graphene on silicon carbide is compared to that of exfoliated flakes where the layer dependence is not observed. Phonon relaxation times, however, are in good agreement. Predictions for future investigations into this novel material based on the works here are suggested in Chapter 7.

30|$|In recent years, the {{operation}} wavelength of silicon photonics has {{extended to the}} mid- and far-infrared (IR) regions due to many potential applications such as chemical and biological sensing [11]. The use of plasmonics in mid- and far-IR regions is attractive because the propagation loss of a plasmonic waveguide decreases dramatically at longer wavelengths and also because the mode cross section of such waveguides is subwavelength, which would significantly enhance light-matter interactions such as THG conversion [7 – 10, 12, 13]. Recent studies have proved that graphene serves as an excellent nonlinear optical material to enhance the nonlinear effect, leading to various applications including <b>four</b> <b>waves</b> <b>mixing</b> [14, 15], THG [16 – 18], all-optical switching [19], and optical bistability [20, 21], due to its large third-order nonlinear optical susceptibility. Especially, the observed threshold of optical bistability can be greatly reduced, thanks to the large third-order nonlinear optical susceptibility of graphene [20, 21]. More interestingly, in contrast to plasmon mode in metals, graphene plasmons (GPs) have significantly larger wave vectors as well as much higher confinement of light, which indicates the capability of further enhancing the CE of THG [13]. However, a direct coupling between the fundamental frequency (FF) GPs and radiation waves is prevented due to their momentum mismatch, which makes implementing this scheme a difficult issue in practice. It {{is for this reason}} that the researchers have employed the guided-mode resonance of gratings to address the coupling issue [12, 18, 20]. The proposed scheme in Ref. [18] is purposely designed to directly excite the FF GPs and hence enhance the CE of third-harmonic frequency (THF) free-space waves in the terahertz domain.|$|R
