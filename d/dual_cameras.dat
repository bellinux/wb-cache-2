However, its hardware still contains some slight differences. Unlike the Nintendo 3DS, which uses two display panels, with a lower touchscreen panel and a top dual-layered screen panel capable of displaying autostereoscopic 3D, the Nintendo 2DS uses a single, non-stereoscopic LCD touchscreen, which is overlaid with a frame mimicking the screen dimensions of the 3DS.

40|$|Mobile camera users trust widely to the {{automatic}} camera settings, but {{the automatic}} settings do not perform equally well in all situations. All of the automatic settings {{have their own}} algorithms, which their operations are based on. Automatic white balance, automatic exposure control and automatic focus are known automatic <b>camera</b> settings. <b>Dual</b> <b>camera</b> system can improve the automatic settings in mobile cameras. In this thesis <b>dual</b> <b>camera</b> algorithms were researched and <b>dual</b> <b>camera</b> algorithm development framework was created. Instead of creating the entire algorithm development framework, the <b>dual</b> <b>camera</b> functionality {{was added to the}} existing single camera algorithm development framework. The existing algorithm development framework was a PC application, which could perform the same image processing steps as mobile phone camera image signal processors. The <b>dual</b> <b>camera</b> development framework is able to collect image parameters and markers from one image and provide these to another image. The <b>dual</b> <b>camera</b> development framework manages the parameter mediation by writing and reading XML files. Few <b>dual</b> <b>camera</b> algorithms were also researched in order to proof the <b>dual</b> <b>camera</b> framework concept. It turned out that the <b>dual</b> <b>camera</b> is able to improve image quality and the automatic camera settings. The automatic exposure control can be improved by collecting additional data from the histogram and by using this information when producing the final image. Motion blur can also be reduced by <b>dual</b> <b>camera</b> algorithm that compares edge data from two distinct images with each other and then provides valuable information about the motion to the exposure control algorithm. The automatic exposure control algorithm can thus reduce exposure time and increase the sensor sensitivity in order to produce sharp images. Automatic white balance can be improved with <b>dual</b> <b>camera</b> system by estimating illumination source with <b>dual</b> <b>camera</b> system. Even though the <b>dual</b> <b>camera</b> seems to provide some advantages to the algorithms, and the concept that the <b>dual</b> <b>camera</b> development framework introduces, seems valid, addition of second camera to mobile phone should be considered carefully. Many of the <b>dual</b> <b>camera</b> algorithms could be transformed to work with only one <b>camera.</b> The <b>dual</b> <b>camera</b> algorithm development takes also a large amount of time and effort, given that the <b>dual</b> <b>camera</b> {{is not going to be}} applied to all future camera phones...|$|R

Given the growing emphasis on simulta-neous imaging {{of more than one}} cardiac variable, we present an analysis of the potential of <b>dual</b> <b>camera</b> imaging, using as an example our straightforward <b>dual</b> <b>camera</b> system that allows simultaneous measurement of two dynamic quantities from the same region of the heart. The advantages of our system over others include an optional software camera calibration routine that eliminates the need for precise camera alignment. The system allows for rapid setup, dichroic image separation, dual-rate imaging, and high spatial resolution, and it is generally applicable to any two-camera measurement. This type of imaging system offers the potential for recording simultane-ously not only transmembrane potential and intracellular calcium, two frequently measured quantities, but also other signals more directly related to myocardial metabolism, such as [K 1]e, NADH, and reactive oxygen species, leading to the possibility of correlative multimodal cardiac imaging.

50|$|The {{film was}} shot with two cameras, both moving perpetually in {{opposite}} directions. The cameras pointed toward no specific area, intended {{to cause the}} audience to move their eyes throughout the scene.

Andrew Dunn, the films cinematographer, appreciated the co-operative nature of Gosford Parks filming process. He shot the film on Kodak Vision Expression 500T film stock generally with two Panavision cameras, using lighting ranging from relatively dim candles to bright hydrargyrum medium-arc iodide lamps.

5000|$|In 1963, the KH-4 {{system was}} {{introduced}} with <b>dual</b> <b>cameras</b> {{and the program}} now made completely secret. The Discoverer label was dropped and all launches became classified. Because of the increased satellite mass, the basic Thor-Agena vehicle was enhanced {{by the addition of}} three Castor solid-fueled strap-on motors. On February 28, 1963, the first Thrust Augmented Thor lifted from VABF's LC-75 carrying the first KH-4 satellite. The launch of the new and unproven booster went awry as one SRB failed to ignite. Eventually the dead weight of the strap-on motor dragged the Thor off its flight path, leading to a Range Safety destruct. It was suspected that a technician had not attached an umbilical on the SRB properly. Although some failures continued to occur during the next few years, the reliability rate of the program significantly improved with KH-4. Maneuvering rockets were also added to the satellite beginning in 1963. These were different from the attitude stabilizing thrusters which had been incorporated {{from the beginning of the}} program. Corona orbited in very low orbits to enhance resolution of its camera system. But at perigee (the lowest point in the orbit), Corona endured drag from the Earth's atmosphere. In time, this could cause its orbit to decay and force the satellite to re-enter the atmosphere prematurely. The new maneuvering rockets were designed to boost Corona into a higher orbit, and lengthen the mission time even if low perigees were used. For use during unexpected crises, the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) kept a Corona in [...] "R-7" [...] status, meaning ready for launch in seven days. By the summer of 1965, NRO was able to maintain Corona for launch within one day.|$|E
