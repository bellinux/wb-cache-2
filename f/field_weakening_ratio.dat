40|$|The {{motor drive}} system {{represents}} a key technology {{for development of}} the electrical vehicles, and the permanent magnet synchronous motor becomes the mainstream of the new energy vehicle drive motor for the superior performances in power density, low-speed torque density, efficiency and reliability. The paper studies the <b>field</b> <b>weakening</b> control strategy for the interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) and provides a <b>field</b> <b>weakening</b> control strategy for the IPMSM at the full-speed range. By studying the mathematical IPMSM model and the methods of conventional vector control and analyzing the operating conditions of the IPMSM at the full-speed range, the paper divides the operating conditions into constant torque operation region I, constant torque operation region II, constant power <b>field</b> <b>weakening</b> operation region and high-speed <b>field</b> <b>weakening</b> operation region to confirm the control strategy algorithm in each region and the transition conditions between regions and provide the current control strategy that the d-axis current and q-axis current are confirmed by the reference torque and the feedback speed. Modeling of the <b>field</b> <b>weakening</b> control strategies in each region is made through the Matlab/Simulink, and simulation of the operating conditions with a steady-state load and a dynamic load is done to verify that the <b>field</b> <b>weakening</b> control strategy in each region is feasible.

In this context, the use of compact machines with high power density is preferred andconsequently high speed machines where <b>field</b> <b>weakening</b> is required. In addition, a really optimal design requires to disposesufficiently accurate models of main physical phenomena involved in electromechanical conversion. This models need to besufficiently fast in order to be suitable with optimization process. An important limitation in the use of internal permanent magnetsynchronous machine with distributed windings is temperatures insides the machine especially in the windings and thus the internallosses. At high speed with <b>field</b> <b>weakening</b> operation, iron losses, sensitive to flux densities variation in iron, could be really highbecause of the high electrical frequency linked to rotor speed and sharp variation of flux density waveforms inside the iron in statordue to the <b>field</b> <b>weakening</b> operation. This study, for the electric machine design, is based on the first harmonic hypothesis, i. e.,without harmonic currents. An original and mathematical model has been developed and provides fast and accurate estimation ofiron losses particularly in <b>field</b> <b>weakening</b> operation even with machine supplied by sinusoidal currents as described in this paper. It uses a polynomial form of iron losses in function of fundamental electrical frequency and take into account the flux densitywaveforms in yoke and teeth by use of nonlinear iron coefficients linked to id–iq currents.

A detailed study of local fluxdensity waveform and harmonic content in yoke and teeth will be provided for two particular operating points: at maximal powerwithout <b>field</b> <b>weakening</b> and at maximal power at maximal speed. These two points require accurate estimation in an optimal designof electrical machine. In addition, the local iron coefficients in teeth and yoke per volume unit will be provided in order to studythe local evolution of iron losses in <b>field</b> <b>weakening</b> operation.

The scheme is employed {{for the purpose}} of sensorless fault-Tolerant torque-controlled drives used in a limp-home mode operation in electric vehicle (EV) applications. The proposed scheme was experimentally tested on a laboratory dynamometer using a 19 -kW IM and a 29 -kW controller, which are both currently used in the automotive industry for EV applications. The scheme was also implemented on an electric golf buggy which was equipped with a 5 -kW IM. A performance comparison was carried out between the proposed and conventional back-EMF MRAS schemes for starting from standstill, sensitivity to parameter variations and constant speed operation with load variations. Utilizing the golf buggy, the behaviors of the new scheme was separately investigated for vehicle starting from standstill, wide speed range including <b>field</b> <b>weakening</b> region, and hill-starting operations. The proposed scheme is computationally easy to implement, robust against sensitivity to parameters variations, inverter nonlinearity and errors due to digitization in the <b>field</b> <b>weakening</b> region.

40|$|Direct {{torque control}} (DTC) {{is a new}} control method for {{rotating}} field electrical machines. DTC controls directly the motor stator flux linkage with the stator voltage, and no stator current controllers are used. With the DTC method very good torque dynamics can be achieved. Until now, DTC {{has been applied to}} asynchronous motor drives. The purpose of this work is to analyse the applicability of DTC to electrically excited synchronous motor drives. Compared with asynchronous motor drives, electrically excited synchronous motor drives require an additional control for the rotor field current. The field current control is called excitation control in this study. The dependence of the static and dynamic performance of DTC synchronous motor drives on the excitation control has been analysed and a straightforward excitation control method has been developed and tested. In the <b>field</b> <b>weakening</b> range the stator flux linkage modulus must be reduced {{in order to keep the}} electro motive force of the synchronous motor smaller than the stator voltage and in order to maintain a sufficient voltage reserve. The dynamic performance of the DTC synchronous motor drive depends on the stator flux linkage modulus. Another important factor for the dynamic performance in the <b>field</b> <b>weakening</b> range is the excitation control. The <b>field</b> <b>weakening</b> analysis considers both dependencies. A modified excitation control method, which maximises the dynamic performance in the <b>field</b> <b>weakening</b> range, has been developed. In synchronous motor drives the load angle must be kept in a stabile working area in order to avoid loss of synchronism. The traditional vector control methods allow to adjust the load angle of the synchronous motor directly by the stator current control. In the DTC synchronous motor drive the load angle is not a directly controllable variable, but it is formed freely according to the motor’s electromagnetic state and load. The load angle can be limited indirectly by limiting the torque reference. This method is however parameter sensitive and requires a safety margin between the theoretical torque maximum and the actual torque limit. The DTC modulation principle allows however a direct load angle adjustment without any current control. In this work a direct load angle control method has been developed. The method keeps the drive stabile and allows the maximal utilisation of the drive without a safety margin in the torque limitation...|$|R
