5|$|American Pharoah {{made his}} track debut in a maiden race over {{six and a}} half furlongs on the Polytrack surface at Del Mar Racetrack on August9. Ridden by Martin Garcia, he started as the 7–5 {{favorite}} against eight opponents. He became unsettled before the race and, after running in second place until the stretch, <b>faded</b> <b>to</b> finish fifth behind Om, Iron Fist, One Lucky Dane, and Calculator, more than nine lengths behind the winner. He ran in a blinker hood, which appeared to unnerve him, as did the commotion in the saddling paddock. Baffert addressed his anxiety issues by removing the hood and stuffing cotton in the horse's ears for subsequent races.|$|E
5|$|GK Persei, {{also known}} as Nova Persei 1901, is a bright nova that {{appeared}} halfway between Algol and Delta Persei. Discovered on 21 February 1901 by Scottish amateur astronomer Thomas David Anderson, it peaked at magnitude 0.2almost as bright as Capella and Vega. It <b>faded</b> <b>to</b> magnitude 13 around 30 years after its peak brightness. Xi Persei, traditionally known as Menkhib, a blue giant of spectral type O7III, {{is one of the}} hottest bright stars in the sky, with a surface temperature of 37,500 K. It {{is one of the more}} massive stars, being between 26 and 32 solar masses, and is 330,000 times as luminous as our Sun.|$|E
5|$|Initially overjoyed at the {{prospect}} of marrying, Marguerite Louise's ebullience <b>faded</b> <b>to</b> dismay when she discovered her half-sister, despite initially favouring the Tuscan match, then changed her mind. In reaction, Marguerite Louise's behaviour became erratic: she shocked the court by going out unaccompanied, a grievous offence in contemporary French society, with her cousin Prince Charles of Lorraine, who soon became her lover. Her marriage by proxy, on 19 April 1661, did nothing to change her attitude, much to the annoyance of Louis XIV's ministers. On the day she was supposed to meet diplomats offering their congratulations on the wedding, she attempted to abscond and go hunting, only to be stopped by the Duchess of Montpensier.|$|E

5|$|A {{thousand}} {{years before the}} events of the game, three entities known as the Warring Triad initiated a conflict that would come to be called the War of the Magi. This quarrel grew to catastrophic proportions, unleashing magical energy into the world which transformed afflicted humans into espers—magical beings who themselves were used as soldiers in the war. Eventually realizing the horrific calamity wrought by their hands, the Triad returned free will to the espers and sealed their own powers, becoming stone statues. Their only request was that the espers ensure their power remain locked away so it might never be used again. The espers carried their stone gods to a hidden land, sealing both the statues and themselves off from the realm of humans. The concept of magic gradually <b>faded</b> <b>to</b> legend and myth as mankind built a society extolling science and technology. At the game's opening, the most advanced nation is the Empire, a cruel and expanding dictatorship led by Emperor Gestahl and his clownish general Kefka Palazzo. Approximately eighteen years before {{the events of the}} game begin, the barrier between the espers' land {{and the rest of the}} world weakened. Soon after, Gestahl takes advantage of this and attacks the espers' land, capturing several of them.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, {{the short}} track relay team won Australia's first Winter Olympic medal, a bronze. They {{qualified}} for the four-team final after edging out Japan and New Zealand, finishing second in their semi-final. The quartet adopted a plan of staying on their feet as the first priority, and remaining undisqualified and defeating {{at least one of}} the other three finalists. During the race, the Canadians fell and lost a significant amount of time, meaning that Australia would win a medal if they raced conservatively and avoided a crash. Late in the race, Nizielski was fighting with his American counterpart for track position to claim the silver medal, but took the safe option and yielded, mindful of the lost opportunity of the crash in Albertville. It was a successful campaign for the largest team that Australia had sent—apart from 1960. The 27 athletes recorded an unprecedented five top 10 finishes. Marshall placed first in the opening round of the aerials, but <b>faded</b> <b>to</b> sixth in the final, while Kerryn Rim placed eighth in the 15km biathlon and Steven Bradbury and Nizielski of the medal-winning relay team placed eighth and tenth in the 500m and 1,000m short track events respectively. In contrast to the previous games, the Australian short track speed skaters placed in the top half of the field in six of their eight individual starts. However, the Australians in the remaining disciplines generally finished in the bottom half of their competition.|$|E
5|$|The basic German (Luftwaffe) {{camouflage}} {{during most}} of the war was based on a light blue undersurface and a two tone splinter pattern of various greens for the upper surfaces. In {{the first year of the}} war, the top colors were dark green and black-green; later, lighter and more greyish colors were used for fighters, though bombers mostly maintained the dark green/black green camouflage. The side of the fuselage on fighters and some light bombers often had irregular patches sprayed on, softening the transition from the upper to the lower surface. The undersides of night bombers and night fighters were painted black early in the war, but by 1943 switched to lighter base colors of their usual light blue undersurfaces for aircraft flown by day, and a light gray base coat over the upper surfaces to match the skyglow over the German cities they were tasked with defending. A special pattern was devised for the Mediterranean front, consisting of a sand yellow that often <b>faded</b> <b>to</b> tan, with or without olive green patches. As Germany lost air supremacy, ground camouflage became increasingly important, and late war fighters received a two tone scheme like the British Sand and Spinach, in dark brown and light green.|$|E
