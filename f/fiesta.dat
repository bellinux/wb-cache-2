5|$|The at-large {{spot in the}} Orange Bowl {{was filled}} via a {{round-robin}} selection procedure defined by the other Bowl Championship series games (the Sugar, <b>Fiesta,</b> and Rose bowls) and the automatic bids. The order of at-large selections rotates annually among the BCS bowls. In 2009, the <b>Fiesta</b> Bowl picked first, followed by the Sugar Bowl, then the Orange Bowl. The <b>Fiesta</b> Bowl picked Ohio State, while the Sugar Bowl selected Utah. The Orange Bowl was thus left to select Big East Conference champion Cincinnati, fulfilling the BCS' contractual obligation to provide a game for the conference's champion.|$|E

Favoring Stanford's potential to draw a large television audience, the Orange Bowl selected the Cardinal, leaving Connecticut to the <b>Fiesta</b> Bowl.|$|E

5|$|Since Oklahoma won the Big12 Championship game, they {{represented}} the Big12 Conference in the <b>Fiesta</b> Bowl in Glendale, Arizona. Contractually, the <b>Fiesta</b> Bowl hosts the Big12 Champion and then picks, {{from among the}} BCS eligible teams, the opponent. For 2007, the <b>Fiesta</b> Bowl picked Boise State as Oklahoma's opponent. The game took place on New Year's Day in the then-new University of Phoenix Stadium, home of the Arizona Cardinals. The Broncos led the Sooners {{the majority of the}} game, but the Sooners made up an 18point deficit late in the game and led by a touchdown with a minute left in regulation. With 18seconds left, the Sooners had the Broncos in a fourth-and-18 situation from midfield, but were stunned when the Broncos executed a hook and lateral for the tying score. This would be only the first of three Boise State trick plays that helped elevate this game to epic status.|$|E

5|$|Two {{weeks after}} the {{selection}} of Kansas, yet another controversy arose when {{it was revealed that}} Big12 and ACC officials had worked out an agreement to feature an Oklahoma/Virginia Tech matchup in the Orange Bowl in the hours leading up to the final selection. Oklahoma, which initiated the proposal, requested that it face the highest-ranked BCS opponent then available, which would have been Virginia Tech (ranked 3rd in the BCS). Normally, Oklahoma, the 2007Big12 Champion, would have played in the <b>Fiesta</b> Bowl, which holds the automatic rights to the Big12 Champion's BCS bid. A little-known clause in the Bowl Championship Series contract, however, allows for the commissioners of the BCS to override that bid if the automatically selected team had played in the game the previous year, or to create a more interesting matchup. Oklahoma had played in the 2007 <b>Fiesta</b> Bowl and seemed a perfect candidate for execution of the clause. Representatives from the Orange and <b>Fiesta</b> bowls reportedly worked out a deal to swap Oklahoma and Kansas and Dan Beebe, the commissioner from the Big12, presented the plan to the BCS committee. The remaining BCS commissioners rejected the request (with only the Big 12, ACC and Big East commissioners in favor) and honored the original selection of Kansas for the Orange Bowl and forced Oklahoma to accept its automatic <b>Fiesta</b> Bowl Bid. The release of this plan upset many fans at both schools and across the country, who perceived that an (4)Oklahoma-(3)Virginia Tech matchup would have been superior to a (8)Kansas-(3)Virginia Tech game. Ironically, while Oklahoma-Virginia Tech was perceived as a better match-up due to their high rankings, both teams went on to be upset by the lower ranked team with Oklahoma losing 48-28 to (9)West Virginia.|$|E

Each year the Chilean President kicks off the <b>Fiestas</b> Patrias celebrations at one of these locales. For many years, the selected fonda was La Grandiosa Bertita.The predominant food associated with the <b>Fiestas</b> Patrias are Chilean empanadas, which are a sort of bread pastry.
