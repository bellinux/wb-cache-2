He excelled in English classes, and with his sister Marcelline, performed in the school orchestra for two years. During his junior year he had a journalism class, structured [...] "as though the classroom were a newspaper office", with better writers submitting pieces to the school newspaper, [...] The Trapeze. Hemingway and Marcelline both had pieces submitted; Hemingway's first piece, published in January1916, was about a local performance by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He edited the Trapeze and the Tabula (the yearbook), imitating the language of sportswriters, taking the pen name Ring Lardner, Jr.—a nod to Ring Lardner of the Chicago Tribune whose byline was [...] "Line O'Type".|$|E

500|$|Leaving Oldbridge, the Way {{follows the}} road for {{approximately}} [...] before turning onto a boreen. To {{the left of the}} boreen is Wart Stone Field, so called on account of a bullaun stone that lies in the <b>field,</b> <b>water</b> from which is said to cure warts. The boreen ends at Brusher Gap, reputed to be a place where locals left food and supplies for Michael Dwyer and his followers when they went on the run after the 1798 Rebellion. The Way enters Drummin forest, a sitka spruce plantation, where it passes an Adirondack shelter, constructed by Mountain , a volunteer group dedicated to trail preservation that has upgraded various sections of the Wicklow Way over the years. The trail climbs Paddock Hill before descending into a plantation of larch trees. The forest floor here is a habitat for spurges, heath bedstraw and fly agaric toadstools. The trail crosses the Military Road, near Laragh, and then a wooden footbridge across the Glenmacnass River. A dense spread of granite boulders litters the riverbed, glacial erratics deposited by melting glaciers {{at the end of the}} last ice age. This stretch of the trail follows an old mass path through a woodland of many native Irish tree species, including oak, rowan, silver birch and willow, carpeted with a forest floor of bilberry, bluebell and hard fern. The Way continues along forest tracks over the shoulder of Brockagh Mountain. At the highest point there is a vista over the Vale of Glendalough with the two lakes nestled in the shelter of Camaderry and Derrybawn Mountains. Exiting the forest, the Way reaches the R756 road and the Glendalough visitor centre. Crossing the Glendasan River, it passes the remains of the Monastic City, founded in the 6th century by Saint Kevin.|$|E

40|$|Immunomagnetic beads (IMB) {{were used}} to recover {{thermophilic}} sulfate-reducing bacteria from oil <b>field</b> <b>waters</b> from oil production platforms in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. IMB coated with polyclonal antibodies against whole-cell antigens of the thermophilic Thermodesulfobacterium mobile captured strains GFA 1, GFA 2, and GFA 3. GFA 1 was serologically and morphologically identical to T. mobile. GFA 2 and GFA 3 were spore forming and similar to the Desulfotomaculum strains T 90 A and T 93 B previously isolated from North Sea oil <b>field</b> <b>waters</b> by a classical enrichment procedure. Western blots (immunoblots) of whole cells showed that GFA 2, GFA 3, T 90 A, and T 93 B are different serotypes of the same Desulfotomaculum species. Monoclonal antibodies (MAb) against T. mobile type strain cells were produced and used as capture agents on IMB. These MAb, named A 4 F 4, were immunoglobulin M; they were specific to T. mobile and directed against lipopolysaccharides. The prevailing cells immunocaptured with MAb A 4 F 4 were morphologically and serologically similar to T. mobile type strain cells. T. mobile was not detected in these oil <b>field</b> <b>waters</b> by classical enrichment procedures. Furthermore, extraction with antibody-coated IMB allowed pure strains to be isolated directly from primary enrichment cultures without prior time-consuming subculturing and consecutive transfers to selective media...|$|R

Wyoming {{is one of}} a few states that allows the discharge of oil <b>field</b> produced <b>water</b> into surface waters for beneficial use by livestock and wildlife. Sixty-six wetland sites receiving oil <b>field</b> produced <b>water</b> discharges in Wyoming were surveyed to determine the percentage of discharges in compliance with NPDES permit requirements and to determine the amount of chronic oil releases associated with these discharges.
