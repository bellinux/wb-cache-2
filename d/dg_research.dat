To this end, the authors sketch the current status of national markets, and identify changes that have occurred during 2007 - 2010. In addition, the factors influencing the development are investigated. Specific barriers are identified and potential interventions to increase energy efficiency investments and to exploit energy saving potentials through ESCOs across Europe are discussed. JRC. DDG.

40|$|Innovation scoreboards {{consist of}} a {{collection}} of national or regional indicators of relevance to innovation. Depending on data availability, an innovation scoreboard can include indicators of innovation inputs such as the supply of scientists and engineers, activities such as R&D collaboration among firms, intermediate innovation outputs such as patents, or market outputs such as the sales of innovative products. Some scoreboards focus entirely on innovation, while other scoreboards include innovation indicators as a major subset of a broader theme, such as economic competitiveness. The number of scoreboards that cover innovation has increased since the mid 1990 s in response to policy and media interest. Examples include DG Enterprise's European Innovation Scoreboard, <b>DG</b> <b>Research's</b> Key Indicators, <b>DG</b> Enterprise's Enterprise Policy Indicators, the OECD's Science, Technology and Industry Scoreboard, the UK Competitiveness Index, the Index of the Massachusetts Innovation Economy, the New Economy Index, the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor and the World Economic Forum Competitiveness Index.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{publishing}} patterns of digital government (<b>DG)</b> <b>research</b> in top scholarly journals in the fields of public administration (PA), public policy (PP), and management information systems (MIS) within the last five years (See Table 1). <b>DG</b> <b>research</b> was published in nine of the twelve top journals in these fields since 1999. A total of 114 DG articles were identified, representing approximately 4. 9 percent of the total number of articles published in these journals between 1999 and 2003. It seems that the top journals have published <b>DG</b> <b>research</b> in limited ways given public and media attention and increased funding opportunities to conduct e-government research. Methodology A purposive sample of the top five scholarly journals in public administration, public policy and management information systems was used, for a total of fifteen journals. These fields were selected because they are often recognized as three of the most important potential outlets for interdisciplinary <b>DG</b> <b>research.</b> The journals were selected by consulting several sources. These sources provided a ranking of the top journals in each field (Forrester & Watson 1994, Saunders 2002). We scanned the table of contents of each journal issue between 1999 and 2003 looking at titles and abstracts; however, we did not systematically examine the body of the articles.
