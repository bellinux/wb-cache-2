5|$|Candide is characterised by its sarcastic tone {{as well as}} by its erratic, fantastical and {{fast-moving}} plot. A picaresque novel with a story {{similar to}} that of a more serious coming-of-age narrative (Bildungsroman), it parodies many adventure and romance clichés, the struggles of which are caricatured <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> that is mordantly matter-of-fact. Still, the events discussed are often based on historical happenings, such as the Seven Years' War and the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. As philosophers of Voltaire's day contended with the problem of evil, so too does Candide in this short novel, albeit more directly and humorously. Voltaire ridicules religion, theologians, governments, armies, philosophies, and philosophers through allegory; most conspicuously, he assaults Leibniz and his optimism.|$|E
5|$|The Sermons of Swift {{have none}} of that thunder which appals, or that resistless and winning {{softness}} which melts, the hearts of an audience. He can never have enjoyed the triumph of uniting hundreds in one ardent sentiment of love, of terror, or of devotion. His reasoning, however powerful, and indeed unanswerable, convinces the understanding, but is never addressed to the heart; and, indeed, from his instructions to a young clergyman, he seems hardly to have considered pathos as a legitimate ingredient in an English sermon. Occasionally, too, Swift's misanthropic habits break out even from the pulpit; nor is he altogether able to suppress his disdain of those fellow mortals, on whose behalf was accomplished the great work of redemption. With such unamiable feelings towards his hearers, the preacher might indeed command their respect, but could never excite their sympathy. It may be feared that his Sermons were less popular from another cause, imputable more to the congregation than to the pastor. Swift spared not the vice of rich or poor; and, disdaining to amuse the imaginations of his audience with discussion of dark points of divinity, or warm them by a flow of sentimental devotion, he rushes at once {{to the point of}} moral depravity, and upbraids them with their favourite and predominant vices <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> of stern reproof, bordering upon reproach. In short, he tears the bandages from their wounds, like the hasty surgeon of a crowded hospital, and applies the incision knife and caustic with salutary, but rough and untamed severity. But, alas! the mind must be already victorious over the worst of its evil propensities, that can profit by this harsh medicine. There is a principle of opposition in our nature, which mans itself with obstinacy even against avowed truth, when it approaches our feelings in a harsh and insulting manner. And Swift was probably sensible, that his discourses, owing to these various causes, did not produce the powerful effects most grateful to the feelings of the preacher, because they reflect back to him those of the audience.|$|E
25|$|Narration describes, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> that is {{at times}} enraptured {{and at other times}} pointedly cynical, Angelica's first visit to the Prince and his family {{following}} her betrothal to Tancredi. Dressed beautifully, she makes her entrance with perfect timing, and immediately endears herself to the Prince. Only Bendicò, growling in a corner, seems unhappy to see her. Finally, narration also describes how Angelica, as she's listening, coolly considers the financial and sexual prosperity that awaits them, and comments that, within a few years of the marriage, Angelica will become one of the great political kingmakers of the Italian Kingdom.|$|E
40|$|The human {{dentition}} {{is naturally}} translucent, opalescent and fluorescent. Differences between {{the level of}} fluorescence of tooth structure and restorative materials may result in distinct metameric properties and consequently perceptible disparate esthetic behavior, which impairs the esthetic result of the restorations, frustrating both patients and staff. In this study, we evaluated the level of fluorescence of different composites (Durafill <b>in</b> <b>tones</b> <b>A</b> 2 (Du), Charisma <b>in</b> <b>tones</b> <b>A</b> 2 (Ch), Venus <b>in</b> <b>tone</b> <b>A</b> 2 (Ve), Opallis enamel and dentin <b>in</b> <b>tones</b> <b>A</b> 2 (OPD and OPE), Point 4 <b>in</b> <b>tones</b> <b>A</b> 2 (P 4), Z 100 <b>in</b> <b>tones</b> <b>A</b> 2 (Z 1), Z 250 <b>in</b> <b>tones</b> <b>A</b> 2 (Z 2), Te-Econom <b>in</b> <b>tones</b> <b>A</b> 2 (TE), Tetric Ceram <b>in</b> <b>tones</b> <b>A</b> 2 (TC), Tetric Ceram N <b>in</b> <b>tones</b> <b>A</b> 1, A 2, A 4 (TN 1, TN 2, TN 4), Four seasons enamel and dentin <b>in</b> <b>tones</b> <b>A</b> 2 (and 4 SD 4 SE), Empress Direct enamel and dentin <b>in</b> <b>tones</b> <b>A</b> 2 (EDE and EDD) and Brilliant <b>in</b> <b>tones</b> <b>A</b> 2 (Br)).

The images were analyzed with the software ScanWhite©-DMC/Darwin systems. The results showed statistical {{differences between the groups}} (p < 0. 05), and between these same groups and the average fluorescence of the dentition of young (18 to 25 years) and adults (40 to 45 years) taken as control. It can be concluded that: Composites Z 100, Z 250 (3 M ESPE) and Point 4 (Kerr) do not match with the fluorescence of human dentition and the fluorescence of the materials was found to be affected by their own tone...|$|R

25|$|Minsc and Boo {{originated}} in {{pen and paper}} Dungeons & Dragons sessions held by the lead designer of Baldur's Gate, James Ohlen. Played by Cameron Tofer, associate producer and lead programmer of MDK2, Minsc was conceived as an unstable comic relief ranger who carried around a pet hamster named Boo in the Dark Sun campaign setting. The lead writer for Baldur's Gate, Lukas Kristjanson, expanded upon the character and created dialogue intended to make Minsc funny and memorable to the general audience. During development, some of the character's lines were rewritten based on the voice actor's readings. As this progressed, the writers noted {{they were able to}} interject dialogue more freely for Minsc into the script <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> suitable for the character. In a 2001 interview, BioWare co-founder Ray Muzyka has stated that among the titles the company has completed, Minsc was his favorite character.|$|E

[...] "Disgusted" [...] is the pseudonym of the supposed letter writer, who is {{a resident of the}} stereotypically middle-class town of Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent, in the south-east of England. The term may have originated either with the 1944 BBC radio programme Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh, a regular writer to The Times or with an editor of the letters page of a local newspaper, the Tunbridge Wells Advertiser.|$|E

500|$|There is {{a famous}} legend {{inspired}} by Euler's arguments with secular philosophers over religion, {{which is set}} during Euler's second stint at the St. Petersburg Academy. The French philosopher Denis Diderot was visiting Russia on Catherine the Great's invitation. However, the Empress was alarmed that the philosopher's arguments for atheism were influencing members of her court, and so Euler was asked to confront the Frenchman. Diderot was informed that a learned mathematician had produced a proof {{of the existence of}} God: he agreed to view the proof as it was presented in court.

500|$|Tolkien {{intended}} The Hobbit as a [...] "fairy-story" [...] {{and wrote}} it <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> suited to addressing children although {{he said later}} that the book was not specifically written for children but had rather been created out of his interest in mythology and legend. Many of the initial reviews refer to the work as a fairy story. However, according to Jack Zipes writing in [...] "The Oxford Companion to Fairy Tales", Bilbo is an atypical character for a fairy tale. The work is much longer than Tolkien's ideal proposed in his essay On Fairy-Stories. Many fairy tale motifs, such as the repetition of similar events seen in the dwarves' arrival at Bilbo's and Beorn's homes, and folklore themes, such as trolls turning to stone, {{are to be found}} in the story.|$|E
500|$|A side {{benefit of}} Tchaikovsky's {{friendship}} with Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov was an increased {{confidence in his}} own abilities as a composer, along with a willingness to let his musical works stand alongside those of his contemporaries. Tchaikovsky wrote to von Meck in January 1889, after being once again well represented in Belyayev's concerts, that he had [...] "always tried to place myself outside all parties and to show in every way possible that I love and respect every honorable and gifted public figure in music, whatever his tendency", and that he considered himself [...] "flattered {{to appear on the}} concert platform" [...] beside composers in the Belyayev circle. This was an acknowledgment of wholehearted readiness for his music to be heard with that of these composers, delivered <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> of implicit confidence that there were no comparisons from which to fear.|$|E

500|$|Distortion was {{at first}} {{produced}} by simply overloading the amplifier to induce clipping, resulting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> rich in harmonics and also in noise, and also producing dynamic range compression and therefore sustain (and sometimes destroying the amplifier). Dave Davies of The Kinks took this technique to its logical conclusion by feeding the output from a 60 watt guitar amplifier directly into the guitar input of a second amplifier. The popularity of these techniques quickly resulted {{in the development of}} electronic devices such as the fuzz box to produce similar but more controlled effects and in greater variety. Distortion devices also developed into vocal enhancers, effects units that electronically enhance a vocal performance, including adding air (noise or distortion, or both). [...] Guitar distortion is often accomplished through use of feedback, overdrive, fuzz, and distortion pedals. Distortion pedals produce a crunchier and grittier tone than an overdrive pedal.|$|E

In an article discussing Hindi film actresses and their flair for comedy, Verma wrote, [...] "What can you say about an actress who giggles non-stop <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> that is anything but prim and propah?
