50|$|The {{plant has}} a {{designed}} capacity to produce 300,000 cars annually, {{originally intended to}} employ 3,000 people organised into three shifts, which {{according to the manufacturer}} equates to an <b>hourly</b> <b>output</b> of 55 vehicles. The Trnava plant was built to produce the company’s “Platform 1” cars, which are small cars. The first car to be produced in volume was the Peugeot 207 produced initially in October 2006 at a daily rate of 450, with an increase to 800 scheduled in time for Q2, 2007. With the 2013 production the factory was close to its planned capacity with daily production of 1200 cars and 3500 emploees. In 2014 with 3500 emploees and 255,176 cars was a capacity used to 85% including 30 days when it was not producing. General director of the plant Rémi Girardon confirmed in March 2015 a plan to produce third car model (Citroën) with a goal of 360.000 cars in 2017 and therefore from May 2015 <b>hourly</b> <b>output</b> will be increased to 57 to 60 vehicles with new employees. In 2016 there will be introduced the fourth (weekend) shift, so the number of emploee should rise in 2018 to around 4200.|$|E

40|$|Summary Patients with burn {{injuries}} involving {{more than}} 20 {{percent of the}} total body surface area lose a lot of fluid and are in the risk of developing a severe hypovolemia. Fluid resuscitation is a corner stone in burn care and is important for preventingfurthercomplications. The most common resuscitation formula is the Parkland Formula. <b>Hourly</b> urine <b>output</b> is a measure used to evaluate if the fluid given is sufficient enough to maintain a sustainable tissue perfusion. Inhalation injury, abuse of alcohol and drugs are some of the factors that may increase the amountoffluid needed. The purposefor this study is to study thecompliance to fluid resuscitation guidelines at a burn unit and which factors lead to deviation from the guidelines. Patient charts for 38 patients with burn injury > 20 %, > 18 years of age with a length of stay > 48 hours, were reviewed regarding size of burn injury, hourly amount of fluid given, <b>hourly</b> urine <b>output</b> and presence of inhalation injury. Statistic significancewas found between the mean values of the differences in percentage between actual and calculated fluid amount for the first 24 hours. The differences in percentage between actual and calculated <b>hourly</b> urine <b>output</b> did not reach statistic significance. The result shows complianceto the fluid resuscitation guidelines.

A previous study reported that the urine output within the first 2  h after a standardized dose of furosemide administration provided the highest prediction {{of the development of}} severe AKI [23]. We reviewed furosemide dose and <b>hourly</b> urine <b>output</b> using ICU medical charts and determined FR of each patient. The timing and dose of furosemide administration were determined by the physician involved. In our regular clinical practice, furosemide dose was decided based on body weight, volume status, cardiac function, serum creatinine concentration at the time of furosemide administration, and presence of complications of chronic kidney disease (CKD). All patients finally enrolled in this study had an indwelling catheter, and <b>hourly</b> urine <b>output</b> could be accurately measured.|$|R

40|$|Controversy remains over {{appropriate}} endpoints of resuscitation during fluid resuscitation {{in early}} burns management. We reviewed the evidence {{as to whether}} utilizing alternative endpoints to <b>hourly</b> urine <b>output</b> produces improved outcomes. MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and full-text clinicians' health journals at OVID, from 1990 to January 2014, were searched with no language restrictions. The keywords burns AND fluid resuscitation AND monitoring and related synonyms were used. Outcomes of interest included all-cause mortality, organ dysfunction, length of stay (hospital, intensive care), time on mechanical ventilation, and complications such as incidence of pulmonary edema, compartment syndromes, and infection. From 482 screened, eight empirical articles, 11 descriptive studies, and one systematic review met the criteria. Utilization of hemodynamic monitoring compared with <b>hourly</b> urine <b>output</b> as an endpoint to guide resuscitation found an increased survival (risk ratio [RR], 0. 58; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 42 - 0. 85; P < 0. 004), with no effect on renal failure (RR, 0. 77; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 39 - 1. 43; P = 0. 38). However, inclusion of the randomized controlled trials only found no survival advantage of hemodynamic monitoring over <b>hourly</b> urine <b>output</b> (RR, 0. 72; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 43 - 1. 19; P = 0. 19) for mortality.

There is limited evidence of increased benefit with utilization of hemodynamic monitoring, however, all studies lacked assessor blinding.
