She added that many types of birds have very sophisticated language systems. Don Kuiken of the University of Alberta finds such research interesting as well as <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>continue</b> to study consciousness with animal models (with differing types of consciousness), {{we would be able}} to separate the different forms of reflectiveness found in today's world.|$|E
25|$|As I {{testified to}} the U.S. Senate in 1998, Iraq has the {{indigenous}} capability right now to reconstitute a chemical weapons program {{within a matter of}} weeks. And my concern is <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>continue</b> to push for military action against Iraq, and once the writing becomes clear on the wall -- and believe me, if Saddam Hussein doesn't understand that President Bush is dead serious about going to war against him now, I don't know when he'll be -- when he'll recognize that. But at some point, I believe that Iraq will seek to reconstitute militarized nerve agent that will be used in defense of Baghdad. And I think the Iraqi government's efforts to acquire significant stockpiles of atropine are an indication that this is the direction that Saddam Hussein is heading.|$|E
500|$|Along {{with the}} wave of the modern ao dai, there is {{criticism}} about these transformation. People who want to reserve traditional value in the ao dai argue that the modern ao dai is miscellaneous. Mr. Duc Hung, Vietnamese famous designer, also raised his opinion about this issue: “I do assert {{that it is not the}} ao dai of Viet Nam. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>continue</b> to advocate the trend of the modern ao dai, the traditional ao dai will be buried in oblivion…”. In spite of this, there are still a lot of favor from Vietnamese youngsters to the modern ao dai.|$|E

500|$|Since Quinn and Basehart did {{not speak}} Italian, both were dubbed in the {{original}} release. [...] Unhappy with the actor who initially dubbed Zampanò, Fellini remembered being impressed by the work done by Arnoldo Foà in dubbing the Toshiro Mifune character in the Italian version of Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon, {{and was able to}} secure Foà's services at the very last moment. [...] Composer Michel Chion has observed that Fellini particularly exploited the tendency of Italian films of the post-war period to allow considerable freedom in the synching of voices to lip movements, especially in contrast to Hollywood's perceived [...] "obsessive fixation" [...] with the matching of voices to mouths: [...] "In Fellinian extremes, when all those post-synched voices float around bodies, we reach a point where voices--even <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>continue</b> to attribute them to the bodies they're assigned--begin to acquire a sort of autonomy, in a baroque and decentered fashion." [...] In the Italian version of La Strada, there are even instances when a character is heard to speak while the actor's mouth is shut tight.|$|E

Penney believed that Britain {{could not afford}} to develop a hydrogen bomb. Henry Tizard believed that the nation should focus on conventional forces instead of duplicating the nuclear capabilities of the American Strategic Air Command, which already defended Britain and Europe: [...] "We are a great nation, but <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>continue</b> to behave like a Great Power we shall soon cease to be a great nation.

However, with the looming questions of the end, Atwood finished the novel for release in 2003. These questions in Oryx and Crake, Atwood explained, are [...] "simply, What <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>continue</b> down the road we're already on? How slippery is the slope? What are our saving graces?

[...] "The matter is serious. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>continue</b> this open door policy there is real danger we will be inundated with people who have no intention of integrating into our society.

2500|$|On 11 August 2015, Prime Minister Abbott, in {{response}} to the cross-party bill to legalise same-sex marriage being introduced to the parliament, called a special joint party room meeting of the Liberal and National parties. The six-hour meeting resulted in 66 Coalition MPs voting against a free vote being held on same-sex marriage legislation and 33 voting in favour of a free vote. Abbott was accused by Christopher Pyne of [...] "branch stacking" [...] the party room by calling a joint meeting with the largely socially conservative Nationals, as this reduced the prospects of a free vote being endorsed. Following the meeting, Abbott announced that whilst the Coalition would maintain its position of marriage being defined as a heterosexual union {{for the duration of the}} existing parliamentary term, he stated it was his [...] "strong disposition" [...] to hold a national vote on same-sex marriage sometime after the 2016 federal election, either in the form of a plebiscite or constitutional referendum. Labor Party Opposition Leader Bill Shorten argued the proposal was a delaying tactic and would waste money, whilst recommitting to introduce a bill to legalise same-sex marriage within 100 days of taking office if successful at the 2016 federal election. On 17 August 2015, in defiance of Mr. Abbott, Liberal backbencher Warren Entsch introduced the aforementioned private members' bill, saying, [...] "a divided nation is what we will be <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>continue</b> to allow discrimination in relation to marriage on the basis of a person's sexuality." ...|$|E

We disagree. Expanding and enforcing the old paradigm is a fool 2 ̆ 7 s errand. Even if current laws were scrupulously enforced, private money from the richest one percent will continue to be the dominant force in politics.

However, the systems at Texas Stadium (Dallas Cowboys), RCA Dome (Indianapolis Colts), and Giants Stadium (New York Giants and Jets) did not receive the HDTV updates since those stadiums were scheduled to be (and since have been) replaced in the forthcoming years.

60|$|Away, then, we went, and plodded on till dark without {{reaching}} the post; nevertheless, being determined to travel {{as long as}} we could, we pushed on till near midnight, when, being quite done up, and seeing no sign of the establishment, we called a council of war, and sat down on a lump of ice to discuss our difficulties. I suggested that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> had not already passed the post, in all probability we should do so, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>continued</b> to travel any farther in the dark. My companion admitted that he entertained precisely the same views on the subject; and, furthermore, that as we both seemed pretty tired, and there happened to be a nice little clump of willows, intermixed with pine trees, close at hand, his opinion was that nothing better could be done than encamping for the night. I agreed to this; and the resolution being carried unanimously, the council adjourned, and we proceeded to make our encampment.|$|R

The passage first named lay in a line with us, and we had every reason to believe the ship could go through it.

All over the country, north and south, wherever you find a group of hills or a pleasant bit of water or a stretch of coast, you'll find some such refuge as this for our weary toilers.
