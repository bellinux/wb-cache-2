500|$|Weiner {{stated that}} the episode was about the {{question}} -- [...] "What do you want?" [...] and [...] "Do you <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> chance to have it?", {{as well as the}} [...] "tentative nature of business friendships". He used Lane's friendship with the Jaguar executive and the dinner at Pete Campbell's house as examples. Vincent Kartheiser reasoned that Pete invited them over to show off his wife, home, and success. Jon Hamm elaborated on Don's reluctance to go as his desire to keep his relationship separate from the poisonous influence of Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.|$|E
2500|$|Yunus was {{the first}} Bangladeshi to <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> Nobel Prize. After {{receiving}} {{the news of the}} important award, Yunus announced that he would use part of his share of the $1.4million (equivalent to $million in [...] ) award money to create a company to make low-cost, high-nutrition food for the poor; while the rest would go toward setting up an eye hospital for the poor in Bangladesh.|$|E
2500|$|Gordon {{remained}} in the Equatoria province until October 1876. Gordon quickly learned that before he could establish stations to crush the slave trade {{that he would have}} to first explore the area to find out where the best places for building stations. A major problem for Gordon was malaria, which decimated his men, and led him to issue the following order: [...] "Never let the mosquito curtain out of your sight, it is more valuable than your revolver". The heat greatly affected Gordon as he wrote to his sister Augusta: [...] "This is a horrid climate, I seldom if <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> good sleep".|$|E

2500|$|Variety {{called it}} [...] "a distended, talky, {{redundant}} and moody melodrama" [...] and added, [...] "The overemphasis on Streisand makes the film just {{another one of}} those Streisand vehicles where no other elements <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> chance." [...] Time Out London observed, [...] "ith the script glossing whole areas of confrontation (from the Communist '30s to the McCarthy witch-hunts), it often passes into the haze of a nostalgic fashion parade. Although Streisand's liberated Jewish lady is implausible, and emphasizes the period setting as just so much dressing, Redford's Fitzgerald-type character [...] [...] [...] is an intriguing trailer for his later Great Gatsby. It's a performance that brings more weight to the film than it deserves, often hinting at depths that are finally skated over." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following touring {{in support}} of Steal This Record bassist Nunley left The Suicide Machines {{to start his own}} band, Blueprint 76, and was {{replaced}} by Rich Tschirhart. The band also ended their contract with Hollywood Records, fulfilling their contractual obligations by releasing the compilation album The Least Worst of the Suicide Machines. They then moved to the independent label Side One Dummy Records. Their next album A Match and Some Gasoline, released in 2003, found the band abandoning the pop experimentations of their previous two albums and returning more to the ska punk and hardcore styles of their earlier years. They also continued exploring sociopolitical themes in songs such as [...] "Did You <b>Ever</b> <b>Get</b> <b>a</b> Feeling of Dread?" [...] and [...] "Your Silence," [...] which were critical of President George W. Bush's administration, its response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. They toured internationally {{in support of}} the album and again performed on the Warped Tour.|$|E
2500|$|Mike Diver of BBC Music gave a mixed review, {{writing that}} [...] "the songs of Who You Are are expectedly split between slower, slushier affairs and punchy anthems for bolshy teens" [...] {{and called the}} album [...] "too patchy, too hurried, the powers behind it too eager to {{capitalise}} on the artist's current chart success", although he felt that [...] "there's ample room for improvement". Ailbhe Malone from NME described it as [...] "cheeky, relevant, and fresh [...] but unfortunately [...] a flash that's shortly over" [...] and noticed that [...] "no matter how much Jessie J sings about being herself, we don't really <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> sense of who, or what, that is". Gary McGinley of No Ripcord called it [...] "an album of two halves as the stronger brat-pop moments soon give way to by insipid, dated ballads"; he noted that [...] "there are glimpses of promise scattered between the overwrought delivery and unnecessary vocal gymnastics", but concluded by saying that Who You Are [...] "promised much more than what has been delivered". Fiona Shepherd [...] of The Scotsman wrote that it [...] "covers all the tried and tested commercial territory: mainly a slick, generic imitation of American R divas [...] blended with the obligatory hip-pop stance" [...] and felt that Cornish [...] "is more interested in tiresome vocal showboating than communicating anything truthful". Eric Henderson from Slant Magazine agreed, saying that [...] "in the quest to find herself, {{she seems to have}} gotten sidetracked". Matthew Perpetua of Pitchfork Media was particularly critical; he felt that [...] "the music is scattered, covering all the bases in an over-eager attempt to prove vocal chops" [...] and noticed that Cornish [...] "comes across like a severely dumbed-down Lily Allen at best, and at worst she seems like someone you would want to root against in a televised singing competition".|$|E
60|$|Walter {{understood}} the Indian {{to mean that}} he would continue {{the work on the}} morrow, and was not particularly interested in the proposed labour, for during the time he had been alone the possibility of <b>ever</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> sufficient capital seemed an obstacle which could not be surmounted.|$|R
40|$|Over 40 {{years ago}} I (Knapp, 1970) {{wrote an article}} {{regarding}} when you should use N and when you should use N- 1 in the denominators of various formulas for the variance, the standard deviation, and the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. I ended my "pro N " article with this sentence: "Nobody <b>ever</b> <b>gets</b> <b>an</b> average by dividing by one less {{than the number of}} observations. "...|$|R

50|$|The {{influence}} on graduate education in pure mathematics {{is perhaps most}} noticeable in the treatment now current of Lie groups and Lie algebras. Dieudonné at one point said 'one can do nothing serious without them', {{for which he was}} reproached; but the change in Lie theory to its everyday usage owes much to the type of exposition Bourbaki championed. Beforehand Jacques Hadamard despaired of <b>ever</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> clear idea of it.|$|R
5000|$|The poem {{is deemed}} seditious {{mainly because of}} the last two lines. Huang Chao started a {{rebellion}} in the late Tang dynasty, causing the dynasty to be weakened and leading to its eventual collapse. The last two lines were thus interpreted by Huang Wenbing as: [...] "If one day Song Jiang <b>ever</b> <b>gets</b> <b>an</b> opportunity to start a rebellion (against the Song dynasty), he will do something greater than Huang Chao." ...|$|R

50|$|The new Titanic Games {{version of}} Kill Doctor Lucky makes two {{changes to the}} {{original}} rules. First, a minor change was made to game play that now allows everyone {{to take at least}} one turn before the Doctor Lucky pawn determines turn order. In the original, it was possible for players to position themselves {{in such a way as}} to keep some players from <b>ever</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> turn. This is no longer possible.|$|R

6000|$|CLARE. I don't know--no pluck this morning! You see, I've got to earn my living--no money; only a {{few things}} I can sell. All {{yesterday}} I was walking about, looking at the women. How does anyone <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> chance? ...|$|E

50|$|According to John Forsythe, the Bentley Gregg {{character}} {{was based on}} two well-known Beverly Hills bachelors at the time. He combined their names and used it for the character's in the program. Because of the implication in the program of Gregg's aversion to marriage, no serious thoughts were given to casting a 'regular' or steady woman for him. Instead, Gregg is forever dating different women with only <b>a</b> handful <b>ever</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> 'second' date with him.|$|R

However, if I do not appear again you will know that I died in a good cause, and, I hope, try to recover my remains and give them decent burial. Also, you might inform the Bishop of how I came to my end, that is, if you <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> opportunity, {{which is more than}} doubtful." ...|$|R
60|$|The Balliol men {{had been}} very {{confident}} in their hero {{up to the last}} half-year; but then they began to doubt. Poor Wilkinson was beaten by his rival out of the field, though, probably, not without an effort. We may say that no man <b>ever</b> <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> double-first in anything without an effort. But be that as it may, Wilkinson was sitting alone, a very unhappy man, in his rooms at Balliol, while Bertram was being fêted to his heart's content at Trinity.|$|R

6000|$|... "It's thrawing his daughter's life awa," [...] said Saddletree to Butler, [...] "to {{hear him}} speak in that daft gate. Where will he <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> Cameronian advocate?

50|$|Down ballot, Lucas Overby got {{the second}} highest {{percentage}} <b>a</b> Libertarian has <b>ever</b> <b>gotten</b> in <b>a</b> house election, with 24.74% of the vote. Many people at the time attributed it {{to the lack of}} a Democrat on the ballot.|$|R
