5|$|It {{is likely}} {{that there is a}} strong <b>genetic</b> <b>component</b> to {{deferred}} gratification, though no direct link has been established. Since many complex genetic interactions are necessary for neurons to perform the simplest tasks, it is hard to isolate one gene to study this behavior. For this same reason, multiple genes are likely responsible for deferred gratification. Further research is necessary to discover the genetic corollaries to delayed gratification.|$|E
5|$|The colour of C.maenas varies greatly, {{from green}} to brown, grey or red. This {{variation}} has a <b>genetic</b> <b>component,</b> but is {{largely due to}} local environmental factors. In particular, individuals which delay moulting become red–coloured rather than green. Red individuals are stronger and more aggressive, but are less tolerant of environmental stresses, such as low salinity or hypoxia. Juvenile crabs on average display greater patterning than adults.|$|E
5|$|Hans Asperger {{described}} common symptoms {{among his}} patients' family members, especially fathers, and research supports this observation and suggests a genetic contribution to Asperger syndrome. Although no specific gene {{has yet been}} identified, multiple factors are believed {{to play a role}} in the expression of autism, given the phenotypic variability seen in children with AS. Evidence for a genetic link is the tendency for AS to run in families and an observed higher incidence of family members who have behavioral symptoms similar to AS but in a more limited form (for example, slight difficulties with social interaction, language, or reading). Most behavioral genetic research suggests that all autism spectrum disorders have shared genetic mechanisms, but AS may have a stronger <b>genetic</b> <b>component</b> than autism. There is probably a common group of genes where particular alleles render an individual vulnerable to developing AS; if this is the case, the particular combination of alleles would determine the severity and symptoms for each individual with AS.|$|E

40|$|<b>Genetic</b> <b>components</b> of {{grey cattle}} in Estonia as {{revealed}} by microsatellite analysis using two Bayesian clustering methods Meng-Hua Li 1 *, Juha Kantanen 1, Annika Michelson 2, Urmas Saarma 3 Background: It was recently postulated {{that a few}} individual grey cattle still found in Estonia might be a relict of the old native cattle stock. Genotypes at 17 microsatellite loci from a total of 243 cattle from North European breeds and 11 grey cattle in Estonia were used {{in an attempt to}} clarify the genetic composition of the grey cattle. Findings: We characterize the <b>genetic</b> <b>components</b> of 11 examples of the grey cattle in Estonia at the population and individual levels. Our results show that the grey cattle in Estonia are most genetically similar to the Holstein-Friesian breed and secondarily to the Estonian Red cattle. Conclusions: Both Bayesian approaches gave similar results in terms of the identification of numbers of clusters and the estimation of proportions of <b>genetic</b> <b>components.</b> This study suggested that the Estonian grey cattle included in the analysis are a genetic composite resulting from cross-breeding of European dairy breeds.

The {{characteristic}} fragmentation of REM sleep, hypnopompic, and hypnagogic hallucinations have a heritable component in other parasomnias, which lends credence {{to the idea that}} sleep paralysis is also genetic. Twin studies have shown that if one twin of a monozygotic pair experiences sleep paralysis that other twin is very likely to experience it as well. The identification of a <b>genetic</b> <b>component</b> means that there is some sort of disruption of function at the physiological level. Further studies must be conducted to determine whether there is a mistake in the signaling pathway for arousal as suggested by the first theory presented, or whether the regulation of melatonin or the neural populations themselves have been disrupted.|$|E

40|$|Comparative {{genomics}} {{provides a}} valuable tool for inferring the evolutionary history of physiological systems, particularly when this information is difficult to ascertain by morphological traits. One such example is the vomeronasal system (VNS), a vertebrate nasal chemosensory system {{that is responsible for}} detecting intraspecific pheromonal cues as well as environmental odorants. The morphological components of the VNS are found only in tetrapods, but the <b>genetic</b> <b>components</b> of the system have been found in teleost fish, in addition to tetrapods. To determine when the <b>genetic</b> <b>components</b> of the VNS originated, we searched for the VNS-specific genes in the genomes of two early diverging vertebrate lineages: the sea lamprey from jawless fishes and the elephant shark from cartilaginous fishes. Genes encoding vomeronasal type 1 receptors (V 1 Rs) and Trpc 2, two components of the vomeronasal signaling pathway, are present in the sea lamprey genome, and both are expressed in the olfactory organ, revealing that the <b>genetic</b> <b>components</b> of the present-day VNS existed in the common ancestor of all extant vertebrates. Additionally, all three VNS genes, Trpc 2, V 1 Rs, and vomeronasal type 2 receptors (V 2 Rs), are found in the elephant shark genome. Because V 1 Rs and V 2 Rs are related to two families of taste receptors, we also searched the early diverging vertebrate genomes for taste system genes and found them in the shark genome but not in the lamprey. Coupled with known distributions of the <b>genetic</b> <b>components</b> of the vertebrate main olfactory system, our results suggest staggered origins of vertebrate sensory systems. These findings are important for understanding the evolution of vertebrate sensory systems and illustrate the utility of the genome sequences of early diverging vertebrates for uncovering the evolution of vertebrate-specific traits...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Many common {{disorders}} {{have multiple}} <b>genetic</b> <b>components</b> which convey increased susceptibility. SNPs {{have been used}} to identify <b>genetic</b> <b>components</b> which are associated with a disease. Unfortunately, many studies using these methods suffer from low reproducibility due to lack of power. Results We present a set of programs which implement a novel method for searching for disease-associated genes using prior information to select and order genes from publicly available databases by their prior likelihood of association with the disease. These programs were used in a published study of childhood-onset SLE which yielded novel associations with modest sample size. Conclusion Using prior information to decrease the size of the problem space to an amount commensurate with available samples and resources while maintaining appropriate power enables researchers to increase their likelihood of discovering reproducible associations. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Synthetic biology aims to the {{rational}} design of gene circuits with predictable behaviours. Great {{efforts have been}} done so far to introduce in the field mathematical models that could facilitate the design of synthetic networks. Here we present a mathematical model of a synthetic gene-circuit with a negative feedback. The closed loop configuration allows the control of transcription by an inducer molecule (IPTG). Escherichia coli bacterial cells were transformed and expression of a fluorescent reporter (GFP) was measured for different inducer levels. Computer model simulations well reproduced the experimental induction data, using a single fitting parameter. Independent <b>genetic</b> <b>components</b> were used to assemble the synthetic circuit. The mathematical model here presented could be useful to predict how changes in these <b>genetic</b> <b>components</b> affect the behaviour of the synthetic circuit. 1...|$|R

25|$|Alcohol {{addiction}} {{is a complex}} disease that results {{from a variety of}} genetic, social, and environmental influences. Alcoholism affected approximately 4.65 percent of the U.S. population in 2001-2002, producing severe economic, social, and medical ramifications (Grant 2004). Researchers estimate that between 50 and 60 percent of alcoholism risk is determined by genetics (Goldman and Bergen 1998; McGue 1999).This strong <b>genetic</b> <b>component</b> has sparked numerous linkage and association studies investigating the roles of chromosomal regions and genetic variants in determining alcoholism susceptibility.|$|E
25|$|Atypical {{hemolytic}} uremic syndrome (aHUS) is {{an extremely}} rare, life-threatening, progressive disease that frequently has a <b>genetic</b> <b>component.</b> In most cases it is caused by chronic, uncontrolled activation of the complement system, {{a branch of the}} body’s immune system that destroys and removes foreign particles. The disease affects both children and adults and is characterized by systemic thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body, which can lead to stroke, heart attack, kidney failure, and death. The complement system activation may be due to mutations in the complement regulatory proteins (factor H, factor I, or membrane cofactor protein), or is occasionally due to acquired neutralizing autoantibody inhibitors of these complement system components, for example anti–factor H antibodies. Despite the use of supportive care, historically an estimated 33–40% of patients died or developed end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with the first clinical bout of aHUS. Including subsequent relapses, a total of approximately two-thirds (65%) of patients died, required dialysis, or had permanent renal damage within the first year after diagnosis despite plasma exchange or plasma infusion (PE/PI).|$|E
