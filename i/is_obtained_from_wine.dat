In 1684, Plot published De origine fontium, a treatise on the source of springs, which he attributed to underground channels originating from the sea. Plot shifted his focus towards archaeology in the 1686 publication of his second book, The Natural History of Staffordshire, but misinterpreted Roman remains as Saxon.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} develop a new food product, {{attractive}} from the organoleptic point of view and with the advantage of being rich in phenolic compounds with antioxidant activity. For that, a phenolic-rich solution <b>was</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> <b>wine</b> and included in the recipe of the yogurts. The product developed was therefore a yogurt with wine antioxidants, prepared in different aroma variations. The results showed that the addi- tion of the phenolic-rich solution caused an increase in the content of antioxidants without affecting acidity. On the other hand, based on sensory analysis, it was possible to choose two final products which were the favorite among the members of the sensorial panel, namely the yogurt with flavor of mixed fruits and sugar and the addition of the wine antioxidants solution and the yogurt with flavor of cinnamon and sugar and the addition of wine antioxidants...|$|R
40|$|The {{intraspecific}} {{genetic diversity}} of Oenococcus oeni, the key organism in the malolactic fermentation of wine, has been evaluated by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), ribotyping, small-plasmid content, and sequencing of RAPD markers with widespread distribution among the strains. Collection strains representing {{the diversity of}} this species have been studied together with some new isolates, many of which <b>were</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> <b>wines</b> produced by spontaneous malolactic fermentation. The RAPD profiles were strain specific and discerned two main groups of strains coincident with clusters obtained by macrorestriction typing in a previous work. Ribotyping and the conservation of RAPD markers indicates that O. oeni is a relatively homogeneous species. Furthermore, identical DNA sequences of some RAPD markers among strains representative of the most divergent RAPD clusters indicates that O. oeni is indeed a phylogenetically tight group, probably corresponding to a single clone, or clonal line of descent, specialized {{to grow in the}} wine environment and universally spread...|$|R

40|$|Yeast Brettanomyces bruxellensis is a {{contaminant}} found {{worldwide and}} {{is responsible for}} red wine spoilage due {{to the development of}} animal and phenolic off-odours. During this study, 24 Brettanomyces bruxellenis isolates <b>were</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> red <b>wine</b> samples <b>from</b> two French wineries and these were discriminated as 23 strains. Nine strains coming from 2 wineries and 4 vintages were cultivated in synthetic wine medium for 1500 hours and they gave nine different behaviours.

40|$|Aims: To {{study the}} yeast {{diversity}} of Nigerian palm wines {{by comparison with}} other African strains. Methods and Results: Twenty-three Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains <b>were</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> palm <b>wine</b> samples collected at four locations in eastern Nigeria, and characterized using different molecular techniques: internal transcribed spacer {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} and sequence analysis, pulsed field gel electrophoresis, inter delta typing and microsatellite multilocus analysis. These techniques revealed that palm wine yeasts represent a group of closely related strains that includes other West African isolates (CBS 400, NCYC 110, DVPG 6044). Population analysis revealed an excess of homozygote strains and an allelic richness similar to wine suggestive of local domestication. Several other African yeast strains were not connected to this group. Ghana sorghum beer strains and other African strains (DBVPG 1853 and MUCL 28071) displayed strikingly high relatedness with European bread, beer or wine strains, and the genome of strain MUCL 30909 contained African and wine-type alleles, indicating its hybrid origin. Conclusions: Nigerian palm wine yeast represents a local specific yeast flora, whereas a European origin or hybrid was suspected for several other Africa isolates. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study presents the first genetic characterization of an autochthonous African palm wine yeast population and confirms the idea that human intervention has favoured yeast migration...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Red <b>wine</b> {{polyphenols}} (RWPPs) <b>were</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> red <b>wine</b> by absorption and elution from a resin column. Red wine (375 mL/d), {{white wine}} (375 mL/d), RWPPs (1 g/d, equiva-lent to 375 mL red wine/d) in capsules, RWPPs (1 g/d) dissolved in white wine, or a control alcoholic drink (40 g ethanol/d) {{was given to}} groups of 6 – 9 healthy men for 2 wk. Plasma LDL was separated by ultracentrifugation and desalted by dialyzing against a phosphate buffer without EDTA. In the copper-catalyzed perox-idation of LDL (copper-diene assay), the mean lag time increased by 17. 8 min after red wine, 14. 2 min after RWPP capsules, and 11. 7 min after RWPPs in white wine. These groups also showed decreases in thiobarbituric acid–reactive substances, lipid perox-ides, and conjugated dienes and increases in plasma and LDL polyphenols. The only change with white wine {{was an increase in}} thiobarbituric acid–reactive substances; there were no changes after the control drink. In a second study, RWPPs (1 and 2 g/d) and vitamin E [1000 IU (671 mg) /d] were given for 2 wk. In the cop-per-diene assay the addition of 10 mmol EDTA/L abolished the increased lag time of 17. 7 min seen with 1 g RWPP/d and changed the increased lag time from 13. 2 to 4. 5 min seen with 2 g RWPP/d. Vitamin E increased lag time by 67. 6 min with dialysis without EDTA and by 50. 5 min with EDTA. When the column method was used for desalting LDL, all 3 treatments produced an increase in lag time. The failure of some authors to obtain antioxidant effects with the consumption of red wine {{may be due to the}} differing tech-niques. Am J Clin Nutr 1998; 68 : 258 – 65.

40|$|The wild grapevine, Vitis vinifera l. subsp. sylvestris Hegi (Gmelin), {{according}} to most opinions represents the progenitor of Vitis vinifera. Even now, {{it can be}} found spontaneous in most regions overlooking the Mediterranean basin, the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. In Italy it is very frequent in the Maremma Tuscany and Sardinia. Aware of the scientific importance of this botanical species, our Department initiated a project to preserve and to study the features of wild vines found in Tuscany, with particular reference recovered in Maremma. Have been identified 167 accessions in different habitats about 70 of which were placed in a special collection, in order to make ampelographyc and molecular observations (nuclear microsatellites and cloroplastic). The investigations carried out so far have shown a wide genetic variability, emphasized by morphological, phenological and qualitative (plants male, female, black and white grapes), between which emerge anthocianin profiles of the grapes very peculiar. As part of the recovered material, thanks to the use of molecular markers was highlighted how some alleged accessions of wild vine are actually the subspecies vinifera. Molecular characterization shows a considerable genetic variability among accessions physically close together. The grapes from the vineyard by biotypes in the collection have reached a good level of technological maturity, making it particularly rich in anthocyanins and total polyphenols. From micro-vinification carried out during the last vintages <b>were</b> <b>obtained</b> interesting <b>wines</b> <b>from</b> several accessions. Ongoing investigations are intended to expand the number of accessions, and to evaluate the genetic closeness also with the currently cultivated vineyards in Tuscany...|$|R

Cyclic voltammetry {{was used as}} the in vitro assay to determine the antioxidant and/or prooxidant properties and, the in vivo effect on mycelial growth of the fungus Botrytis cinerea was evaluated. In addition, the prooxidant activity was evaluated by intracellular oxidation of compound 2, 7 -dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) in B. cinerea. The extracts used in this study <b>were</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> grape pomace of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carménère and Syrah varieties from the Misiones de Rengo Vineyard by simple extraction, using methanol/HCl 1 % (v/v), ethanol 70 % (v/v), or Soxhlet extraction.
