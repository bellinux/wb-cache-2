5|$|Appointees to {{the offices}} of Steward of the Manor of Northstead and Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds are alternated so that two MPs can resign at once (as {{happened}} on 23 January 2017). However every new appointment to the Stewardship revokes the previous appointment {{so there is no}} difficulty <b>in</b> <b>situations</b> in which more than two resign, such as the 1985 walkout of Ulster Unionist MPs when several separate appointments were made on a single day.|$|E
5|$|Cervical {{agenesis}} {{is a rare}} congenital {{condition in}} which the cervix completely fails to develop, often associated with the concurrent failure of the vagina to develop. Other congenital cervical abnormalities exist, often associated with abnormalities of the vagina and uterus. The cervix may be duplicated <b>in</b> <b>situations</b> such as bicornuate uterus and uterine didelphys.|$|E
5|$|In {{especially}} {{severe cases}} of OFC, parathyroidectomy, or the full {{removal of the}} parathyroid glands, is the chosen route of treatment. Parathyroidectomy {{has been shown to}} result in the reversal of bone resorption and the complete regression of brown tumors. <b>In</b> <b>situations</b> where parathyroid carcinoma is present, surgery to remove the tumors has also led to the regression of hyperparathyroidism as well as the symptoms of OFC.|$|E

40|$|Situation {{calculus}} {{has been}} widely applied in Artificial Intelligence related fields. This formalism is considered as a dialect of logic programming language and mostly used in dynamic domain modeling. However, type systems are hardly deployed <b>in</b> <b>situation</b> calculus <b>in</b> the literature. To achieve a correct and sound typed program written <b>in</b> <b>situation</b> calculus, adding typing elements into the current situation calculus will be quite helpful. In this paper, we propose to add more typing mechanisms to {{the current version of}} situation calculus, especially for three basic elements <b>in</b> <b>situation</b> calculus: situations, actions and objects, and then perform rigid type checking for existing situation calculus programs to find out the well-typed and ill-typed ones. In this way, type correctness and soundness <b>in</b> <b>situation</b> calculus programs can be guaranteed by type checking based on our type system. This modified version of a lightweight situation calculus is proved to be a robust and well-typed system. ...|$|R
5|$|The final {{consideration}} is cost: {{how much will}} a particular defensive strategy cost a plant in energy and materials? This is particularly important, as energy spent on defense cannot be used for other functions, such as reproduction and growth. The optimal defense hypothesis predicts that plants will allocate more energy towards defense when the benefits of protection outweigh the costs, specifically <b>in</b> <b>situations</b> where there is high herbivore pressure.|$|E
5|$|The {{most widely}} used route is orotracheal, in which an endotracheal tube is passed through the mouth and vocal {{apparatus}} into the trachea. In a nasotracheal procedure, an endotracheal tube is passed through the nose and vocal apparatus into the trachea. Other methods of intubation involve surgery and include the cricothyrotomy (used almost exclusively in emergency circumstances) and the tracheotomy, used primarily <b>in</b> <b>situations</b> where a prolonged need for airway support is anticipated.|$|E

5|$|All {{anticoagulants}} {{are generally}} contraindicated <b>in</b> <b>situations</b> where {{the reduction in}} clotting that they cause might lead to serious and potentially life-threatening bleeds. This includes people with active bleeding conditions (such as gastrointestinal ulcers), or disease states with increased risk of bleeding e.g. low platelets, severe liver disease, uncontrolled hypertension. For patients undergoing surgery, treatment with anticoagulants is generally suspended. Similarly, spinal or lumbar puncture (e.g. spinal injections, epidurals, etc.) carry increased risk so treatment is suspended prior to these procedures.|$|E

5|$|Based on the {{findings}} of these and other studies in the early 1970s, the current consensus is that the use of methoxyflurane should be restricted only to healthy individuals, <b>in</b> <b>situations</b> where it offers specific advantages and even then, only at dosages less than 2.5MAC hours. Partly because of these warnings, but also because of the development of newer volatile anesthetics such as enflurane, isoflurane, desflurane and sevoflurane, the clinical use of methoxyflurane as a general anesthetic in humans was largely abandoned in the mid-1970s.|$|E

5|$|Both sexes {{build the}} nest; the {{building}} periods {{can be as}} brief as three days to as long as four weeks. Egg count differs by location; the number has been as low as two and as high as five. Egg color varies; they can appear bluish green to pale yellowish blue, spotted abundantly in reddish brown. Both sexes incubate but the female is mainly responsible {{as well as being}} the sole provider of brooding. Curve-billed parents defend their nests fervently against other species; snakes are the most frequent predators of eggs and nestlings. Curved-billed Thrashers are rarely victims of nest parasitism by cowbirds. <b>In</b> <b>situations</b> where food is scarce, parents feed older fledglings first.

5|$|Targeted Killings: Law and Morality in an Asymmetrical World is a non-fiction {{compilation}} {{book about}} targeted killing edited by Claire Finkelstein, Jens David Ohlin, and Andrew Altman.
