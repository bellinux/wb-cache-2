5|$|Certain {{types of}} {{underwear}} {{are described as}} bikini underwear and designed for men and women. For women, bikini or bikini-style underwear is underwear that is similar in size and form to a regular bikini. It can refer to virtually any undergarment that provides less coverage to the midriff than traditional underwear, panties or knickers, especially suited to clothing such as crop tops. For men, bikini briefs are undergarments that are smaller and more revealing than men's regular briefs. Men's bikini briefs can be low- or <b>high-side</b> that are usually lower than true waist, often at hips, and usually have no access pouch or flap, legs bands at tops of thighs. String bikini briefs have front and rear sections that meet in the crotch {{but not at the}} waistband, with no fabric {{on the side of the}} legs.|$|E
25|$|When {{so-called}} <b>high-side</b> injection {{has been}} used, where the local oscillator is {{at a higher}} frequency than the received signal (as is common), then the frequency spectrum of the original signal will be reversed. This {{must be taken into}} account by the demodulator (and in the IF filtering) in the case of certain types of modulation such as single sideband.|$|E
25|$|The {{frequency}} of the local oscillator fLO is set so the desired reception radio frequency fRF mixes to fIF. There are two choices for the local oscillator frequency because the dominant mixer products are at fRF±fLO. If the local oscillator frequency {{is less than the}} desired reception frequency, it is called low-side injection (fIF = fRF − fLO); if the local oscillator is higher, then it is called <b>high-side</b> injection (fIF = fLO − fRF).|$|E

50|$|The first event, {{the five}} lap Superbike race, was delayed by over-night rain {{to allow the}} circuit to dry and also due to a medical {{emergency}} at Metropole Corner in Portrush. The delayed race was reduced to four laps (35.744 miles). These delays along with another medical emergency lead to other race reductions, including the North West 200 being cut from six to four laps. The event remained dry {{and there were no}} major crashes or injuries. The only notable incident was Conor Cummins <b>high-siding</b> his bike on the exit of University Corner during the Superstock race. Cummins was uninjured.|$|R
50|$|He {{started the}} 2006 season strongly, lying {{sixth in the}} British Superbike Championship after five meetings. At Oulton Park he {{finished}} 3rd in race two, before being demoted to fourth as he was deemed to have gained a place from Shane Byrne on the last lap illegally, although he claimed that he crossed the infield grass as he was squeezed out of road. He qualified fifth at Mondello Park before heavy rain forced the cancellation of the races, and claimed {{that he had been}} on race tyres, rather than special soft qualifying compounds. He impressed at Mallory Park too, qualifying on the front row and running second until <b>high-siding</b> in race one, despite having no race engineer for the weekend. At Knockhill he took pole position, and followed a fourth in race one with his first career podium in race two, passing Leon Haslam for second with two laps to go. He ultimately took fourth in the championship, ahead of the factory Honda of Karl Harris.|$|R
25|$|O'Hare's initial {{maneuver}} was a <b>high-side</b> diving attack employing accurate deflection shooting. He accurately placed {{bursts of}} gunfire into a Betty's right engine and wing fuel tanks; when the stricken craft of Nitō Hikō Heisō Tokiharu Baba (3rd Shotai) {{on the right}} side of the formation abruptly lurched to starboard, he ducked to the other side of the V formation and aimed at the enemy bomber of Ittō Hikō Heisō Bin Mori (3rd Shotai) on the extreme left. When he made his third and fourth firing passes, the Japanese planes were close enough to the American ships for them to fire their anti-aircraft guns. The five survivors managed to drop their ordnance, but all ten 250kg bombs missed. O'Hare's hits were so concentrated, the nacelle of a Betty jumped out of its mountings, after O'Hare blew up the leading Shōsa Takuzo Ito's Betty's port engine. O'Hare believed he had shot down five bombers, and damaged a sixth. Lieutenant Commander Thach arrived at the scene with other pilots of the flight, later reporting that at one point he saw three of the enemy bombers falling in flames at the same time.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{essential}} to remember that, for N-MOSFETs, the <b>high-side</b> switch must be driven to a higher voltage than Vi. To achieve this, MOSFET gate drivers typically feed the MOSFET output voltage back into the gate driver. The gate driver then adds its own supply voltage to the MOSFET output voltage when driving the <b>high-side</b> MOSFETs to achieve a Vgs equal to the gate driver supply voltage. [...] Because the low-side Vgs is the gate driver supply voltage, this results in very similar Vgs values for <b>high-side</b> and low-side MOSFETs.|$|E
5000|$|Charge {{pumps are}} used in H bridges in <b>high-side</b> drivers for gate-driving <b>high-side</b> {{n-channel}} power MOSFETs and IGBTs. When the centre of a half bridge goes low, the capacitor is charged through a diode, and this charge is used to later drive {{the gate of the}} <b>high-side</b> FET a few volts above the source voltage so as to switch it on. This strategy works well, provided the bridge is regularly switched and avoids the complexity of having to run a separate power supply and permits the more efficient n-channel devices to be used for both switches. This circuit (requiring the periodic switching of the <b>high-side</b> FET) may also be called a [...] "bootstrap" [...] circuit, and some would differentiate between that and a charge pump (which would not require that switching).|$|E

5000|$|If the {{attacker}} {{has a significant}} altitude advantage, a <b>high-side</b> guns pass is usually prudent. Sometimes called a [...] "swoop", [...] "boom and zoom", [...] "hit and split", plus {{a variety of other}} names, it consists of a powered dive toward the rear quarter of a lower flying opponent. Shooting with the cannons in a single, high-speed pass, {{the attacker}} uses excess kinetic energy to disengage from the fight in a zoom climb back to a safe altitude, restoring the potential energy. This allows the attacker to set up another attack and dive again. Surprise is often a key element in this type of attack, and the attackers will often hide in the sun or clouds, stalking their opponents until a good opportunity is presented. A <b>high-side</b> guns pass is a very effective tactic against a more maneuverable opponent, where the turning battle of a dogfight is best avoided.|$|E
50|$|A further {{variation}} is the half-controlled bridge, where the low-side switching device {{on one side}} of the bridge, and the <b>high-side</b> switching device on the opposite side of the bridge, are each replaced with diodes. This eliminates the shoot-through failure mode, and is commonly used to drive variable or switched reluctance machines and actuators where bi-directional current flow is not required.|$|E

50|$|An Immelmann trades {{airspeed}} for altitude {{during a}} 180 degree change in direction. The aircraft performs {{the first half}} of a loop, and when completely inverted, rolls to the upright position. The Immelmann is a good offensive maneuver for setting up a <b>high-side</b> guns pass against a lower altitude, slow moving opponent, going in an opposite direction. However, an Immelmann is a poor defensive maneuver, turning the defender into a slow moving target.|$|E
50|$|Dale Earnhardt Jr. led {{the field}} to the green flag at 7:58 p.m., but {{teammate}} Chase Elliott passed him in Turn 3 and led the first lap. After leading the first four, Elliott dropped {{to the bottom and}} allowed Brad Keselowski to pass him on the <b>high-side</b> going into Turn 1 to take the lead on the fifth lap. Ryan Sieg and Cole Whitt suffered engine failures on lap 10, bringing out the first caution of the race.|$|E
50|$|On 24 July 2012, Pramac Ducati {{announced}} that Elias {{would replace the}} injured Hector Barbera until he was deemed fit to race. He raced a Satellite version of the GP12. At Laguna Seca he qualified 17th and retired during the race. He was scheduled to ride at Indianapolis but Barbera {{decided he wanted to}} return early, however Barbera suffered a <b>high-side</b> in Practice and injured his leg once more. Elias substituted for him until San Marino.|$|E

50|$|For a {{radio signal}} like SSB with wider {{bandwidth}} than Morse code, low-side injection preserves the relative {{order of the}} frequency components. <b>High-side</b> injection reverses their order, which is often desirable to counteract a previous reversal in the radio receiver. For radio amateurs it is conventional practice to use lower sideband below 10 MHz and upper sideband above 10 MHz, however the 60 metre band is different, using upper sideband. Amateurs have the band as secondary users and that practice retains compatibility with the primary users.|$|E
50|$|The {{opposite}} of an Immelmann is the Split-S. This maneuver consists of rolling inverted and pulling {{back on the}} stick, diving the aircraft into a half loop, which changes the aircraft's direction 180 degrees. The split-s is rarely a viable option in combat as it depletes kinetic energy in a turn and potential energy in a dive. It is most often used {{to set up a}} <b>high-side</b> guns pass against a lower but fast moving opponent that is traveling in the opposite direction. Also, the split-s is sometimes used as a disengagement tactic.|$|E
50|$|Under {{clear blue}} Illinois skies, Kevin Harvick led {{the field to}} the green flag at 3:18 p.m. He edged out Joey Logano to lead the first lap. The first caution of the race flew on the second lap when A. J. Allmendinger came down across the nose of Denny Hamlin and went {{spinning}} in turn 3. Trying to avoid ramming the No. 47 car, Hamlin got loose on the <b>high-side,</b> spun out and slid down the race track. He didn't suffer any damage and he continued on racing.|$|E
50|$|The Accident Investigation Committee {{determined}} that Kato crashed {{when he lost}} control of his machine, which entered a near <b>high-side</b> state, followed by an uncontrollable oscillating weave resulting in him leaving the track and striking the barrier. Initially he and the bike struck a tire barrier, followed by a foam barrier. Importantly, there was {{a gap between the}} tire and foam barriers. Kato was fatally injured when his head struck the edge of the foam barrier, dislocating the joint between the base of the skull and the cervical spine.|$|E
5000|$|In , {{he joined}} the factory-backed Ducati Xerox Team to replace the {{retiring}} Bayliss, winning his first race at Phillip Island, and taking an early championship lead. However, a severe <b>high-side</b> crash during Race 2 in Round 9 at Donington Park put his pursuit of the 2009 championship in doubt. [...] With Haga out of race 2, Ben Spies took victory and reduced Haga's points lead to 14.
