5|$|It was {{something}} we wanted to wrap {{up to a certain}} extent. It's a disservice to Rick's character to make him look like he's completely clueless. But this isn't really a resolution per se. It makes things a little bit more tense, moving into this next episode. Seeing Rick interact with Shane will have an extra level of tension because now the audience has one up on Shane as opposed to one up on Rick. It’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> waiting for the other shoe to drop, when Rick may or may not confront Shane with this information.|$|E
500|$|Smart {{also said}} of the opening scene that: [...] "It encapsulates that {{character}} in one moment and says so much about her impulsiveness. We could not have accomplished that with a dozen speeches. When I {{saw it in the}} script, I thought 'this is great, this lady is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> to play.|$|E
2500|$|Discussing {{how he and}} his sibling {{decide which}} {{projects}} to work on, Mike Chapman said, [...] "We learned how to politely say no to things that were going to affect our lives negatively.

5000|$|... "This {{new series}} looks like it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> great <b>fun,</b> but it's presumably not meant <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken too seriously, because surely life in MI5 can't be this exciting? Of if it were, we'd all <b>be</b> {{queueing}} up <b>to</b> talk in clipped and meaningful tones while striding down official-looking corridors." [...] Alison Graham of the Radio Times ...|$|R
5000|$|Phil Dyess-Nugent from The A.V. Club gave a C+ rate to the episode. [...] "The Secret Circle itself {{needs to}} succumb to passion if it’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> any <b>fun.</b> But passion <b>is</b> best {{conveyed}} by people who’ve experienced it first-hand, and this show seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the work of people who’ve only heard misleading rumors about the stuff." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the final}} game of the month Vancouver played the Rangers and former coach Alain Vigneault. Daniel Sedin said of the game: [...] "I know our former coach is over there, but once you get into the game you're not going to think too much about it. He was with us for seven years and he meant a lot to this franchise, so it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> seeing him again but once the game gets going we want the two points, and so does he". Tortarella stated: [...] "I'm not going to lie, it's a little weird for me coming back, but once the game starts, it's about playing and {{trying to find a way}} to get a win". The Canucks lost the game 5–2, {{finishing}} the month with 31 points, four points out of the final playoff spot.|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll {{think that}} {{up as we}} go along. We'll hold a session of the club here in the {{graveyard}} every night and talk over what we've done through the day, and if we think we've done anything that isn't right or that would disgrace dad the one that does it, or is responsible for it, must be punished. That's the rule. We'll all decide {{on the kind of}} punishment--it must be made to fit the crime, as Mr. Flagg says. And the one that's, guilty will be bound to carry it out and no shirking. There's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> in this," [...] concluded Jerry, with a relish.|$|E

60|$|Many of {{the senior}} clerks had {{occasion}} {{to pass through the}} waiting-room. Two {{of the senior}} clerks held views about the weather which they appeared wishful to express at length.

500|$|... {{and give}} it a little {{performance}} twist, I'll bring that album cover to life, so it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> really <b>fun.</b> I can't give too much away about the songs, but it's definitely <b>going</b> <b>to</b> represent the album because the album is very multilayered. It doesn't represent 'Your Body' as a single tone. It has its ballads; and everything comes from a very sincere, deeprooted place whether it's having fun or being vulnerable.|$|R

50|$|The {{theme song}} for the series was written by Andy Sturmer and sung by Mz. Moxy. The main title were created by Renegade Animation. The flash {{animated}} sequence during the main title was designed to let the audience know that the show is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> and not just an action show. The opening credits were altered in the third season and beyond to reflect that Ghostfreak was no longer to be used, {{and was replaced by}} Cannonbolt as the ninth alien.|$|E

Gwen didn’t want to work on the cruise ship just for money but also to have some fun with her friends while working. While at first hesitant, the group of friends changes their minds and all the girls apply to work on the ship after graduation.|$|E

That's why, {{when she hears}} Angelus is out, she automatically breaks out of prison. She doesn't even think it, she's out. Because of what he's done for her. And they share that common bond." [...] He adds, [...] "It's {{going to be interesting}} to see how Angelus relates to Faith, because he's never met her before and this is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> for him." ...|$|E

5000|$|Creative Consultant David Abramowitz says of both actors Roger Daltrey and Elizabeth Gracen, [...] "They bring {{magic to}} the piece.

And I know that they are going to bring {{something}} beyond the page to the film. They have been wonderful." [...] Executive Script Consultant David Tynan thinks, [...] "Daltrey was fun in anything. The trouble was that we had killed off Fitzcairn. But on Highlander this is not the problem that it is with other shows, because one can always go into the past, when the person was alive." ...|$|E
