5|$|By the 13th century, {{the church}} had a stone-built nave and chancel; the latter survives in the present building, as does a 12th-century font which was {{probably}} taken <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> in place at that time. A chancel arch was inserted between the nave and chancel in about 1300. The dedication to Saint Margaret is later: it was first recorded in 1489.|$|E

5|$|After {{the events}} of Iron Man 3, Mike Peterson is out with his son, Ace, when {{the top floor of}} a nearby {{building}} explodes. Peterson uses enhanced strength to save a trapped woman <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> and is filmed doing so by Skye, a member of the hacktivist group the Rising Tide. S.H.I.E.L.D. deputy director Maria Hill interviews Grant Ward for a new team under Agent Phil Coulson, who is officially dead. Coulson assigns Ward level 7 security clearance, and reveals the team's first mission is to investigate the Rising Tide. Coulson also recruits the reluctant Agent Melinda May, who had previously retired from field duty.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the launch}} site on Meck began in late 1967. In this installation, the {{majority}} of the system was built above ground in a single-floor rectangular building. The MSR was built in a boxy extension on the northwestern corner of the roof, with two sides angled back to form a half-pyramid shape where the antennas were mounted. Small clutter fences were built to the north and northwest, and the western side faced out over the water which was only a few tens of meters <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> Illeginni did not have a radar site; it was operated remotely from Meck.|$|E
5|$|Continued ingress {{of water}} from the roof and from unroofed {{exterior}} walkways above the ceiling level had caused seepage which carried down salts <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> mortar and deposited them on the ceiling through evaporation. In places this caused the surface of the frescoes to bubble and lift. Although discolouration was a serious problem, bubbling was not, because the thinness and transparency of the paint which Michelangelo employed on the greater part of the ceiling permitted the salts to pass through rather than accumulating beneath the surface.|$|E

5|$|During the protest, {{the crowd}} {{assaulted}} a JNA armoured personnel carrier {{and managed to}} remove a machine gun mounted on the vehicle, while one of the protesters, Ivica Balić, hoisted a Croatian flag at the building to singing of the Croatian anthem by the crowd. In a scuffle which broke {{out in front of}} the building, Saško Gešovski, a JNA conscript from Macedonia, was killed by a shot fired from the crowd. By the end of the afternoon, the crowd removed the Yugoslav flag <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> moved away and dispersed.|$|E
5|$|Edge {{returned}} on the September 9, 2013, {{episode of}} Raw {{in his hometown}} of Toronto where he hosted his talk show The Cutting Edge having Daniel Bryan as his special guest after Randy Orton was scheduled to be his original guest. Edge insulted Triple H in the segment, who retaliated by labeling Edge's main event push as a complete failure and sending The Shield to attack Edge's friend Christian. When Edge went to confront Triple H, he was escorted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> Edge hosted The Cutting Edge on the September 13 episode of SmackDown, where he mocked Randy Orton and watched as Orton's attack on Bryan backfired.|$|E
5|$|In February 1994, the Great Southern Hotel {{ended its}} {{operations}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> as the hotel faced increasing {{competition in the}} hospitality industry. At {{the time of its}} closure, the hotel was operating only 40 rooms that were equipped with a double-bed and a ceiling fan, catering mainly to budget travellers from Malaysia and Indonesia. The other seven existing tenants of the building vacated their businesses after the building was sold, and were each paid a compensation sum.|$|E

5|$|Johnson {{was born}} 9 March 1915 in Barrow upon Soar, Leicestershire, to Alfred Johnson and Beatrice May Johnson. He lived and {{was brought up}} in Melton Mowbray, where his father was a policeman. Alfred Johnson was an Inspector by the mid-1930s. One evening Oswald Mosley, the leader of the British Union of Fascists, held a meeting in the town. The license for the meeting expired at 22:00 at which time Alfred Johnson went alone and ejected the Fascists <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b>|$|E
5|$|Meare Pool was drained {{after the}} Dissolution of the Monasteries {{and the fish}} house fell into disrepair. It {{suffered}} {{a fire in the}} 1880s, which destroyed the roof and gutted the interior. In 1893 some repairs were made to the walls, although the roof was not replaced until work was undertaken by the Ministry of Works in the 1920s, with further conservation being carried out in the 1960s. A piece of timber <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> was subject to dendrochronology testing in an attempt to provide a more specific date for the buildings construction, but the results proved inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|No more volumes were {{purchased}} {{until the end}} of 1820, when the society acquired the works of Livy, Tacitus, and John Marshall's Life of Washington. Three months later, the society purchased a bookcase for its growing collection. In April 1821, the society further expanded its library with the acquisitions of Nathaniel Hooke's Roman History, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Building</b> of Rome to the Ruin of the Commonwealth, the works of Herodotus, Travels in Greece, Modern Europe, David Ramsay's History of the United States, and the works of Benjamin Franklin.|$|E

5|$|On 5 February 2009 a fire {{broke out}} at the west wing on {{the third and fourth}} floor of the College building. Eight London Fire Brigade fire engines were able to bring the flames under control, in the {{meantime}} 35 people were evacuated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> and a further 100 from adjacent buildings. Fortunately no records or books of the College were damaged. Repairs to the smoke-damaged rooms and exterior brickwork were completed in December 2009.|$|E
5|$|Pliny the Elder and {{his party}} saw flames coming from several parts of the crater. After staying overnight, the party was driven <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> by an {{accumulation}} of material, presumably tephra, which threatened to block all egress. They woke Pliny, who had been napping and emitting loud snoring. They elected {{to take to the}} fields with pillows tied to their heads to protect them from the raining debris. They approached the beach again but the wind prevented the ships from leaving. Pliny sat down on a sail that had been spread for him and could not rise even with assistance when his friends departed. Though Pliny the Elder died, his friends ultimately escaped by land.|$|E
5|$|Production {{processes}} for {{primary and secondary}} lead are similar. Some primary production plants now supplement their operations with scrap lead, and this trend {{is likely to increase}} in the future. Given adequate techniques, secondary lead is indistinguishable from primary lead. Scrap lead <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> trade is usually fairly clean and is re-melted without the need for smelting, though refining is sometimes needed. Secondary lead production is therefore cheaper, in terms of energy requirements, than is primary production, often by 50% or more.|$|E
50|$|Contaminations of <b>the</b> <b>building</b> with {{asbestos}} {{or other}} harmful materials might also affect the total value; {{this is usually}} accounted for by subtracting <b>the</b> decontamination costs <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>building's</b> value.|$|R

5|$|The Bristol County Jail {{was added}} to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The jail is {{significant}} as a relatively unaltered historic jail that was important to the 18th-century Bristol County. It is also significant in that it currently serves as the home of the Bristol Historical and Preservation Society. The Society also houses its library and collections in the jail and runs a small museum shop <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{damage caused}} to the North Tower {{destroyed}} any {{means of escape}} at the impact zone or above it. All stairwells and elevators from the 92ndfloor up were rendered impassable, trapping 1,344people. According to the Commission Report, hundreds were killed instantly by the impact; the rest were trapped and died from the subsequent fire and smoke, the eventual collapse, or (in some cases) after jumping or falling <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> Elevator shafts channeled burning jet fuel through the building. At least one elevator shaft carried burning fuel downward, exploding on the 77thfloor, the 22ndfloor, and at street level on the West Side Lobby.|$|E
5|$|The lobby guard {{returned}} {{a call to}} the alarm monitoring service, which had called when the alarm initially went off to confirm that there was a fire, but never called the Philadelphia Fire Department. The first call came from someone on the street who saw smoke coming <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> During the first 911 call, at about 8:27 PM, the alarm company alerted the fire department to the fire. Engine 43 was the first firefighting unit to arrive at the scene and reported seeing heavy smoke and flames in one of the windows. As firefighters started fighting the fire it had grown with flames breaking through windows and lapping {{up the side of the}} building.|$|E
