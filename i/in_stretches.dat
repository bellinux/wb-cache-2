These mangroves have recently become classified as protected nature reserves. The noxious water hyacinth weed is still growing <b>in</b> <b>stretches</b> between Fernvale and the Mount Crosby Weir but only poses a minimal risk to drinking water supplies.|$|E

[...] At Bacup the headwater of the Irwell is discoloured by ochre deposits from a disused mine but work is being done to stop the ochre seepage. [...] Fish do exist in the stretch between Rossendale and Bury and fish are to be introduced <b>in</b> <b>stretches</b> between Radcliffe and Manchester. However, it is feared that it will be many years before fish will be able to breed freely in the river.|$|E

It is also hoped that the water will help dilute contaminants in the river caused by pesticides and fertilizers that are applied to the surrounding farmland. In turn, the boost in flow could assist restoration efforts and help flush out saline water in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, where water is pumped into state aqueducts which provide water supplies to two-thirds of Californians.|$|E

2500|$|Beyond the {{frequent}} feminine endings, the meter is quite regular, {{but there are}} several significant cases in which, rather than {{the rhythm of the}} words determining the meter, the meter determines the rhythm of the words. This occurs especially <b>in</b> <b>stretches</b> of monosyllabic function words (like prepositions, conjunctions, and especially pronouns). The words at the beginning of line 5 could be emphasized in almost any combination and still deliver some sense; but when emphasized in accord with a regular meter, the reading [...] "For how do I hold thee" [...] underscores the antithetical rhetoric Shakespeare is known for. A similar effect can be heard in line 9's [...] "thy own worth", and likely in line 13's [...] "Thus have I had thee", emphasizing both the speaker's possession and its being past.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the left}} of the 143rd Brigade, Springfield was the first {{objective}} of three companies of the 1/8th Warwick, supported by two companies of the 1/7th Warwick. As the rain came down again, water pooled <b>in</b> <b>stretches</b> up to [...] wide. Four tanks drove up the road towards the Triangle and some troops reached the gunpits but two of the tanks bogged down beyond Hillock Farm. C Company of the 1/8th Warwick was ordered to use the road to advance on Springfield but most had already become casualties and only about 15 men advanced. In the rain and gathering darkness, German return fire was inaccurate until the party reached the bogged tanks. Amidst shrapnel-fire the party struggled on and when the survivirs reached the Triangle, they found that the German small-arms fire was too high and the artillery-fire had died down. Wounded in shell-holes nearby from the 1/8th Worcester and 1/7th Warwick joined the party and a tank drove behind the Springfield blockhouse to be knocked out soon after it opened fire. As the party got closer in the darkness, another party attacked from the opposite side and was eventually found to be from the 1/7th Warwick. The German garrison ran out and 16 prisoners were taken but they had only moved about [...] when they were hit by German machine-gun fire.|$|E
2500|$|The Nayak Palegars {{built the}} fort as an impregnable {{fortification}} for defense purposes with 19 gateways, 38 posterior entrances, 35 secret entrances, four invisible passages, water tanks and 2000 watch towers to guard and keep vigil on the enemy incursions. The storage warehouses, pits and reservoirs were primarily {{designed to ensure}} the food, water and military supplies required to endure a long siege. Uniquely, all these facilities are still well conserved. Seven walls (called Yelusuttinakote in local language) form the fort. Each wall has a gate with an ascending access through winding narrow corridors {{which would make it}} difficult to use elephants for attacking the fort or to use “battering rams” to break down the gates. Small embrasures in the fort walls were [...] provided for use by archers to shoot arrows at the enemy. Four gates were provided in the outermost walls. The four gates (called Bagilu in Kannada) are Rangayyana Bagilu, Siddayyana Bagilu, Ucchangi Bagilu and Lalkote Bagilu. Among the elaborate gateways, the gateway to the east of the fort has architectural features typical of the Bahmani Sultanate. Depending on the topography and the geological strata of the land, the fort walls were built with height ranging from [...] Initially, it was built in mud but was subsequently strengthened <b>in</b> <b>stretches</b> with granite stone slabs in the 18th century. An outstanding feature noticed in several stretches of the fort walls is that no cementing material was used in joining the large granite cubes that have been neatly sized, cut, trimmed and placed in position. The total length of the fort walls is about [...] and covers an area of about [...] It is also said that when the upper fort was strengthened for military purposes with gun positions, the services of French mercenaries were used. The massive 'Palace of Stones' fort contained many buildings and many temples set in the rocky surroundings on the hill. Madakari Nayaka V, the last ruler of the Nayakas of Chitradurga, utilized the fort successfully for defense until he was defeated by Hyder Ali in 1779. The fort thus stands as a tribute to the Nayakas who ruled this part of Karnataka.|$|E

60|$|I {{revisited}} {{these things}} last summer. I found such a spectacle of decay {{that it seems}} almost impossible to describe it {{to those who have}} never seen the like. Streets with great holes where the drains had fallen <b>in.</b> <b>Stretches</b> of roadway from which the wood paving had been torn for firewood. Lampposts that had been knocked over lying as they were left, without an attempt to set them up again. Shops and markets deserted and decayed and ruinous. Not closed shops but abandoned shops, as abandoned-looking as an old boot or an old can by the wayside. The railways falling out of use. A population of half a million where formerly there had been two. A strangely homeless city, a city of discomforts and anxieties, a city of want and ill-health and death. Such was Petersburg in 1920.|$|E

He was the owner, without encumbrance, of two hundred and fifty thousand acres of land--land that varied in value from a thousand dollars an acre to a hundred dollars, that varied from a hundred dollars to ten cents an acre, and that, <b>in</b> <b>stretches,</b> was not worth a penny an acre. The improvements on that quarter of a million acres, from drain-tiled meadows to dredge- drained tule swamps, from good roads to developed water-rights, from farm buildings to the Big House itself, constituted a sum gaspingly ungraspable to the country-side.|$|E
6000|$|The {{preliminary}} discomforts and harshnesses, {{which generally}} {{make the first}} days of a sea voyage so cheerless and trying to the temper, being somehow lived through, the succeeding days passed pleasantly enough. October was well advanced, but steadily burning with a warmth that made the early months of the summer appear very young and capricious. Great tracts of the earth lay now beneath the autumn sun, and the whole of England, from the bald moors to the Cornish rocks, was lit up from dawn to sunset, and showed <b>in</b> <b>stretches</b> of yellow, green, and purple. Under that illumination even the roofs of the great towns glittered. In thousands of small gardens, millions of dark-red flowers were blooming, until the old ladies who had tended them so carefully came down the paths with their scissors, snipped through their juicy stalks, and laid them upon cold stone ledges in the village church. Innumerable parties of picnickers coming home at sunset cried, [...] "Was there ever such a day as this?" [...] "It's you," [...] the young men whispered; [...] "Oh, it's you," [...] the young women replied. All old people and many sick people were drawn, were it only for a foot or two, into the open air, and prognosticated pleasant things about the course of the world. As for the confidences and expressions of love that were heard not only in cornfields but in lamplit rooms, where the windows opened on the garden, and men with cigars kissed women with grey hairs, they were not to be counted. Some said that the sky was an emblem of the life to come. Long-tailed birds clattered and screamed, and crossed from wood to wood, with golden eyes in their plumage.|$|E
