5|$|As {{the city}} has a high {{proportion}} of public servants, the Commonwealth Government contributes the largest percentage of Gross State Product and is the largest single employer in Canberra, although no longer the majority employer. Compared to the national averages, the unemployment rate is lower and the average income higher; tertiary education levels are higher, while the population <b>is</b> <b>younger.</b> Property prices are relatively high, in part due to comparatively restrictive development regulations.|$|E
5|$|Struthiosaurinae {{is one of}} the longest-lasting {{groups of}} ankylosaurians. They range from Europelta at 112 Ma to Struthiosaurus, which lived until the {{uppermost}} Cretaceous, or 66 Ma. In between those two early and late struthiosaurines are the genera Anoplosaurus and Hungarosaurus. Hungarosaurus <b>is</b> <b>younger,</b> at about 85 Ma, from the late Santonian of the Csehbánya Formation. Anoplosaurus is a fair amount older, at about 100 Ma, from the late Albian Cambridge Greensand.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the group}} of people at risk for SAH <b>is</b> <b>younger</b> than the {{population}} usually affected by stroke, the risk still increases with age. Young people are much less likely than middle-age people (risk ratio 0.1, or 10 percent) to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The risk continues to rise with age and is 60 percent higher in the very elderly (over 85) than in those between 45 and 55. Risk of SAH is about 25 percent higher in women over 55 compared to men the same age, probably reflecting the hormonal changes that result from the menopause, such as a decrease in estrogen levels.|$|E

5|$|Beauchamp is {{sometimes}} known as Walter de Beauchamp of Elmley, to distinguish {{him from the}} members of the Beauchamp family of Bedford. He married the daughter of Urse d'Abetot, who is usually named Emeline, although her name is not given in contemporary records. Urse d'Abetot was the Sheriff of Worcestershire from around 1069 to around 1108. Beauchamp may have been a tenant of his father-in-law prior to his marriage. Nothing is known for sure of Beauchamp's background, and he first witnessed a royal charter sometime between 1108 and 1111. Some documents suggest that his father may have been named Peveral de Beauchamp and that he had a brother named William Peveral de Beauchamp, but the only identifiable Peveral <b>is</b> <b>younger</b> than Walter.|$|E
5|$|At the wedding, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) {{arrives with}} her husband Ravi (Sendhil Ramamurthy), where Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) surprises them with a baby, his son Drake, that he had with a former girlfriend who then {{abandoned}} them both. Jim tells Dwight that under Schrute tradition, he {{is not allowed to}} be best man as he <b>is</b> <b>younger</b> than him. Jim surprises him with the arrival of Michael Scott (Steve Carell). The wedding proceeds in Schrute tradition with Michael as Dwight's new best man. At the reception, Michael shows Pam pictures of his kids with Holly Flax, and Pam notes that he is paying for two phones just to hold all the images. Ryan deliberately gives Drake an allergic reaction so that Ravi, a pediatrician, can attend and Ryan can steal Kelly away. Kevin tells Ravi that Ryan wanted him to keep Drake so that Ryan can have Kelly and the two can start a new life together. Ravi then gives Kevin the baby to give to Child Services before leaving, but Nellie, who has still been wanting a child, takes Drake instead.|$|E

25|$|Any {{sexual contact}} between minors {{the age of}} 9 and 16 is Criminal sexual abuse. When the victim <b>is</b> <b>younger</b> than 9 and the {{perpetrator}} 13 to 16, the crime becomes Aggravated Criminal Sexual Assault; when the victim <b>is</b> <b>younger</b> than 13 and the perpetrator 17 or older, it becomes Predatory criminal sexual assault of a child. Sex with a victim with severe intellectual disability at any age, or with a family or household member under 18, is Aggravated criminal sexual abuse, though penetration upgrades it to Aggravated Criminal Sexual Assault.|$|E

25|$|The {{principle}} of intrusive relationships concerns crosscutting intrusions.

25|$|The {{principle}} of superposition states that a sedimentary rock layer in a tectonically undisturbed sequence <b>is</b> <b>younger</b> than the one beneath it and older than the one above it. Logically a younger layer cannot slip beneath a layer previously deposited. This principle allows sedimentary layers {{to be viewed as}} a form of vertical time line, a partial or complete record of the time elapsed from deposition of the lowest layer to deposition of the highest bed.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{women do}} not serve in the altar except in women's monasteries. In that case they do not receive the {{clerical}} tonsure (though they must be tonsured nuns), and do not vest in the sticharion, but wear their normal religious habit for attending services, and serve at a certain distance from the actual altar table. Normally, only older nuns may serve in the altar; but the Hegumenia (Abbess) is permitted to enter even if she <b>is</b> <b>younger.</b> A few parishes have begun to use women as altar servers.|$|E

25|$|Three {{species have}} been identified. P. lakustai, from the Wapiti Formation, the bonebed horizon of which is roughly {{equivalent}} age to the upper Bearpaw and lower Horseshoe Canyon Formations, {{is known to have}} existed from about 73.5-72.5 million years ago. P. canadensis <b>is</b> <b>younger,</b> known only from the lower Horseshoe Canyon Formation, about 71.5-71 Ma ago. Fossils of the youngest species, P. perotorum, have been recovered from the Prince Creek Formation of Alaska, and date to 70-69 million years ago. The presence of three known species makes this genus the most speciose among the centrosaurines.|$|E
25|$|The Arctic Cordillera <b>is</b> <b>younger</b> {{than the}} Appalachians, and so erosion {{has not had}} time to reduce it to rounded hills. The {{mountains}} are also barren because trees can neither survive the extremely cold winter temperatures, nor grow during the short summers. Vast areas are covered by permanent ice and snow. The Arctic Cordillera resembles the Appalachians in composition and contain similar types of minerals. The mineral resources have not been greatly exploited, however, because the region's remote location makes development too costly when cheaper alternatives exist further south.|$|E
25|$|Paul Langevin and von Laue {{showed that}} the twin paradox can be {{completely}} resolved by consideration of acceleration in special relativity. If two twins move away from each other, {{and one of them}} is accelerating and coming back to the other, then the accelerated twin <b>is</b> <b>younger</b> than the other one, since he was located in at least two inertial frames of reference, and therefore his assessment of which events are simultaneous changed during the acceleration.
