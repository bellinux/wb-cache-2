5|$|Cracker Barrel {{was founded}} in 1969 by Dan Evins, a sales {{representative}} <b>for</b> <b>Shell</b> Oil, who developed the restaurant and gift store concept initially as a plan to improve gasoline sales. Designed to resemble the traditional country store that he remembered from his childhood, with a name chosen {{to give it a}} Southern country theme, Cracker Barrel was intended to attract the interest of highway travelers. The first restaurant was built close to Interstate 40, in Lebanon, Tennessee. It opened in September 1969, serving Southern cuisine including biscuits, grits, country ham, and turnip greens.|$|E

In 1928 Cain joined the Honourable Artillery Company, a unit of the Territorial Army (TA).

5|$|In 1965, Fredrik Reinfeldt {{was born}} in Allmänna BB {{hospital}} in Stockholm and was the oldest of three brothers to his parents Bruno (1938-2016) and Birgitta Reinfeldt. At {{the time of his}} birth his parents lived in an apartment in Österhaninge, in the south of Stockholm County, but a short time afterwards the family moved to London, where his father worked as a consultant <b>for</b> <b>Shell.</b> Upon returning to Sweden, the family first lived in an apartment in Handen before moving to a terraced house in Bromsten in northwestern Stockholm. The Reinfeldt family was living in Bromsten when Fredrik's younger brothers, Magnus and Henrik, were born in 1969 and 1973. In 1976 the family moved into a single-family home in Täby in northeastern Stockholm County. His mother Birgitta was a leadership and management consultant, and some of her professional skills might have inspired and impressed the young Fredrik.|$|E

5|$|That night, SpongeBob {{goes to his}} {{favorite}} restaurant, Goofy Goober's, where he drowns his sorrows in ice cream with his best friend Patrick Star. Elsewhere, Mr. Krabs' business rival Plankton steals King Neptune's crown, leaving false evidence to frame Mr. Krabs for the crime, and sends the crown to Shell City, a distant, mysterious land from which no fish has returned. The next morning, Neptune barges into the Krusty Krab 2 and threatens Mr. Krabs for his alleged thievery. SpongeBob later arrives and chastises Krabs {{under the influence of}} an ice cream headache, but seeing his boss's life is at risk, he promises Neptune that he will retrieve the crown from Shell City. Neptune freezes Krabs and orders SpongeBob to return with the crown in six days for him to spare Krabs' life. Neptune's sympathetic daughter, Princess Mindy, gives SpongeBob a Bag of Winds so that they can return from Shell City once they find the crown. SpongeBob and Patrick leave <b>for</b> <b>Shell</b> City in the Patty Wagon, a car shaped like a Krabby Patty.|$|E

25|$|These {{mid-range}} stars ultimately {{reach the}} tip of the asymptotic-giant-branch and run out of fuel <b>for</b> <b>shell</b> burning. They are not sufficiently massive to start full-scale carbon fusion, so they contract again, going through a period of post-asymptotic-giant-branch superwind to produce a planetary nebula with an extremely hot central star. The central star then cools to a white dwarf. The expelled gas is relatively rich in heavy elements created within the star and may be particularly oxygen or carbon enriched, {{depending on the type of}} the star. The gas builds up in an expanding shell called a circumstellar envelope and cools as it moves away from the star, allowing dust particles and molecules to form. With the high infrared energy input from the central star, ideal conditions are formed in these circumstellar envelopes for maser excitation.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s, {{downtown}} comprised {{a modest}} collection of mid-rise office structures, but has since grown {{into one of}} the largest skylines in the United States. In 1960, the central business district had 10 million square feet (930,000m²) of office space, increasing to about 16million square feet (1,500,000m²) in 1970. Downtown Houston was on the threshold of a boom in 1970 with 8.7million square feet (800,000m²) of office space planned or under construction and huge projects being launched by real estate developers. The largest proposed development was the 32-block Houston Center. Only {{a small part of the}} original proposal was ultimately constructed, however. Other large projects included the Cullen Center, Allen Center, and towers <b>for</b> <b>Shell</b> Oil Company.

The sale of shells and shell jewelry is an additional source of income. Its beaches are known for their pūpū, tiny shells that wash onto shore during winter months. Species used <b>for</b> <b>shell</b> leis includes momi (Euplica varians), laiki or rice shells (Mitrella margarita) and kahelelani (Leptothyra verruca). The shells and jewelry are so popular that Governor Linda Lingle signed a bill in 2004 to protect lei pūpū o Niihau (Niihau shell leis) from counterfeiting.
