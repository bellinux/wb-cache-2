500|$|Entertainment Weekly Ken Tucker {{called the}} episode [...] "at once cool-looking, heart-tugging, and pretty simple", {{especially}} {{when compared to}} previous episodes like [...] "White Tulip". Writing for The A.V. Club, Noel Murray graded the episode with an A, explaining [...] "I can't really find anything to complain about here. The direction was effectively moody and snappy, the performances were sharp, and the case was cool." [...] Murray praised the subtle characteristics of the parallel universe, the action scenes, {{and the use of}} split-screens to visually show Milo's predictions. MTV's Josh Wigler believed that the episode [...] "demonstrated how the mystery-of-the-week format can still be compelling: by taking everything familiar and applying a stark new layer of paint." [...] Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times wrote [...] "The third season of Fringe continues to get better with each episode. Most importantly, it has momentum. It's moving forward with a distinct destination, and even though I know Fringe is heading somewhere, I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> that might be, or what's going to happen when we get there. Boy, if you're not watching Fringe, you're missing out." ...|$|E
500|$|On an {{exclusive}} interview with Access Hollywood, Cyrus spoke in regards to the music video for the song, directed by Marc Webb. She said, [...] "I wanted something crazy that no one else has done and like really random because this song is kinda random." [...] Shot on November 16, 2007 in a suburban area of Los Angeles, California, the video included fifty background dancers, such as a middle school teacher. Cyrus said the concept was, [...] "I'm singing and dancing and like rocking out and I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> these people come from." [...] The portion of the music video in which she enters the [...] "carnival-like" [...] scene drew influences from the 1950s and Hairspray. Another concept she further explained was the appearance of a man in a [...] "prom-setting." [...] Cyrus said, [...] "Here it's gonna be the guy that I'm supposed to 'start all over' and we're at prom, so I'm just [...] not like in a dress or anything. So, it's random. It's like everything is happening all at once." [...] The ending of the music video, she explained, was when she went back to [...] "where [...] belongs" [...] after a day of [...] "torture." ...|$|E
500|$|... 2008: In early March, Favre {{announces that}} he is {{retiring}} from the Green Bay Packers. At a news conference he said [...] "I know I can play, but I don't think I want to. It's been a great career for me, but it's over. As they say, all good things must come to an end. I look forward to whatever the future may hold for me." [...] Later in the month Favre has second thoughts and wants to return. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Favre backed out of a meeting with Packers management two days before re-entry talks were to begin. In April, Sam Farmer from the Los Angeles Times reported that Favre's agent Bus Cook was making inquiries to other teams about Favre. Favre responded by saying [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> that came from, but it certainly didn't come from me. I'm happy about my decision and I haven't once said 'I wonder if I made the wrong decision.' I know it's the right one. It's kind of funny. Even when I'm retired, they won't let me stay retired." [...] Also in April, the Packers placed Favre on the Reserve-Retired list and planned to have Favre's number retired during the season opener against the Minnesota Vikings. In June, Favre said he told head coach Mike McCarthy {{he wanted to come}} back to the team. He said [...] "When he picked up the phone again after he dropped it, he said, 'Oh, God, Brett. You're putting us in a tight spot. He said, 'Brett, playing here is not an option.' Those were his exact, exact words." [...] In July, Favre sent a letter requesting his release from the Packers. A couple months earlier Favre contacted Mike McCarthy about coming out of retirement and was [...] "rebuffed" [...] according to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel report. Then a report came in from ESPN that said that Favre had wanted to come out of retirement but the Packers were reluctant to take him back. The Packers refused to give Favre an unconditional release. A few days later, Favre had an interview with Greta Van Susteren of Fox News where he accused general manager Ted Thompson of forcing him to make a decision on his return to the team too quickly. Two days after the interview, the Packers filed tampering charges with the NFL front office charging that the Minnesota Vikings had inappropriate contact with Favre. The Packers then offered Favre a retirement package of $25 million marketing agreement to remain retired. This offer was rejected and Favre was subsequently traded to the New York Jets.|$|E

2500|$|According to Butler, Ward's drum solo [...] "Rat Salad" [...] {{resulted}} from the band having to play eight and three quarter hour spots a night in Europe early in their career. [...] "Bill used {{to fill out a}} whole 45 minutes doing a drum solo just {{to get rid of that}} 45 minutes," [...] he revealed to Classic Albums. [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> the title came from, though." [...] In 2013, Sabbath biographer Mick Wall described the closing track on the album, [...] "Fairies Wear Boots", as a [...] "hard-driving riff sweetened by a beautifully baleful melody" [...] with a lyric written by Osbourne about a nasty encounter with a group of skinheads.|$|E
2500|$|The title Peruchazhi {{refers to}} Bandicota (a rodent), about the title Vaidyanathan said: [...] "A {{bandicoot}} {{has its own}} instincts. For instance, we <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> it comes from and where it vanishes to. It just appears and takes what it wants in the process. Jagannathan, the character played by Lal Sir , is like that. He {{will do anything to}} win". He describes Peruchazhi as a spoof about how a politician from Kerala ends up being the chief political adviser to a state election campaign in California and the havoc he creates while chasing success there. Since Vaidyanathan wanted the protagonist to have international appeal, he named him [...] "Ulaganathan" [...] (conqueror of the world) in his original Tamil script; in Malayalam the name was changed to [...] "Jagannathan", its meaning unchanged.|$|E
2500|$|Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode {{positive}} review, {{giving it a}} B-. However, she pointed out that [...] "I’m having trouble with Merida’s entry into OUAT season five because I’m just not that invested in the character. Not that she isn’t a plucky little heroine—oh God, she’s plucky!—but because her own backstory and mythology doesn’t offer is a lot. Snow is now a terrible character, but her story was always rich with possibilities: the apple, the mriror, the queen, the hunter, even the dwarves. Everyone knows that story, even if they don’t know they know it. But if you didn’t check out Brave in the theater a few summers ago—which you probably wouldn’t do unless you were a small child or had a small child yourself— you would <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> there are bears running around {{all over the place}} this episode." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{difference}} in musical style and composition in Love Is Dead compared to Kerli's second album's material is significant. Love Is Dead being alternative rock {{and the new}} material being {{along the lines of}} synthpop. Kerli describes herself as being very depressed during the production of Love Is Dead and that she felt [...] "scattered" [...] and describes the transition to the new sound as an attempt to [...] "make it really radio friendly without losing what people already love about [...]" [...] In response to criticism concerning her sound compared to her older sound, Kerli said she was [...] "not the same person anymore", stating [...] "Maybe I will be [...] my third album. Maybe I'll be totally depressed and write another really dark album. I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> I'm going to go. All I know is that I'm just always going to try to grow and do my best. And whatever comes out of me is just going to be a reflection of who I am at that moment." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Tenth Doctor's era is also heavily revisited. [...] His {{marriage}} to Queen Elizabeth I, mentioned in [...] "The Shakespeare Code" [...] and The End of Time, is finally depicted.

When he leaves after learning of Trenzalore, the Tenth Doctor remarks, [...] "I don't want to go…", his incarnation's final words from The End of Time; the Eleventh Doctor tells Clara that [...] "he always says that" [...] after his TARDIS leaves. The Moment device was originally mentioned in The End of Time, but had not been explored in depth until now, where it takes the form of [...] "Bad Wolf", a seemingly omnipotent being and personalisation of the Time Vortex itself, which manifested in Rose Tyler when she absorbed the Time Vortex in the first series finale, [...] "The Parting of the Ways".
