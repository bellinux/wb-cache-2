50|$|A {{contract}} for future sale is a sales contract under which a farmer agrees to deliver products of specified {{quality and quantity}} to a buyer for a specified price within a prescribed time frame. Contract sales are a growing practice, recently accounting for 86% of poultry, over 80% of tobacco, more than 50% of fruits, and 43% of milk.

50|$|A pilot Advance Market Commitment (AMC) {{to develop}} a vaccine against pneumococcus was {{launched}} in June 2009 as a strategy to address two of the major policy challenges to vaccine introduction: a lack of affordable vaccines on the market, and insufficient commercial incentives to develop vaccines for diseases concentrated in developing countries. Under the terms of an AMC, donors make a legally binding guarantee that, if a future vaccine is developed against a particular disease, they will purchase a predetermined amount at an agreed-upon price. The guarantee is linked to safety and efficacy standards that the vaccine must meet and is structured {{in a way to}} allow several firms to compete {{to develop a}}nd produce the best possible new product. AMCs reduce risk to donor governments by eliminating the need to fund individual research and development projects that may never produce a vaccine. If no company produces a vaccine that meets the predetermined standards, governments (and thus their taxpayers) spend nothing. For the bio-pharmaceutical industry, AMCs create a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>market,</b> with a promise of returns that would not normally exist. For developing countries, AMCs provide funding to ensure that those vaccines will be affordable once they have been developed. It is estimated that the pneumococcal AMC could prevent more than 1.5 million childhood deaths by 2020.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 80's, {{there was a}} {{significant}} issue regarding geography-based educational software: nationwide programs were often too general to be useful in teaching students about their own state. While software companies were unwilling to make 50 different versions of their games, the burden on making a state-centered program was too much for an individual educator. The solution was special collaborations between software makers and states, with the result being new products aimed at a state level for students. This arrangement worked for all parties: educators and students receive a useful teaching/learning aid, the State education department gets educational software [...] "tailor made to their requirements", and the software company has a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>market</b> and only deals with one customer while able to considerably cut costs such as marketing.

5000|$|NSC-68 itself did {{not contain}} any {{specific}} cost estimates {{at a time when}} the United States was committing six to seven percent of its GNP to defense. It was evident that the limits the President had previously set on defense spending were too low. NSC-68 called for tripling defense spending to $40 or $50 billion per year from the original $13 billion set for 1950. NSC-68 does specify a reduction of taxes and a [...] "reduction of Federal expenditures for purposes other than defense and foreign assistance, if necessary by the deferment of certain desirable programs", as a means for paying for it. However, several officials involved in the preparation of the study, including the future chairman of the president's Council of Economic Relations Leon Keyserling, suggested that the massive increase in military spending could be afforded by deliberate acceptance of government deficits, which would have the added benefit of energising and stimulating parts of the American economy, as it did after 1930. Indeed, the document does note that achieving a high gross national product “might itself be aided by a build-up of the economic and military strength of the United States…”, and the Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Lovett also suggested that the American economy [...] "might benefit from the kind of build-up we are suggesting". In essence, NSC-69 advocated a form of military Keynesianism, in which, according to Noam Chomsky is a system of [...] "state-corporate industrial management" [...] needed [...] "to sustain high-technology industry, relying on the taxpayer to fund research and development and provide a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>market</b> or waste production, with the private sector taking over when there are profits to be made".|$|E

The analysis is based on a synthesis of interviews carried out between April and October 2005 with farmers and local stakeholders in four districts of Thai Binh province, Vietnam. At present, pig manure is traded in its scraped and unprocessed form; it is being used as fertilizers and fish feed; its transport is limited, so exchanges are restricted to a small area. However, links between people are very strong, which guarantee a very strong mutual trust between people, as well as between stakeholders, but this is also what makes exchanges so limited. Thus, to organize this processing and to <b>guarantee</b> <b>markets</b> for manure, a large-scale awareness and extension campaign is necessary among the technical departments of local authorities and with farmers. ...|$|R
