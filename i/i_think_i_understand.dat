500|$|The exact {{genre of}} Nightcrawler {{has been the}} subject of debate. While most critics agree that the film {{predominantly}} features thriller elements, other descriptions have been used, including dark comedy, drama, horror, and neo-noir. When asked about the film's genre, Gilroy stated: [...] "I see Nightcrawler as having genre elements in the sense that it’s a thriller. It also has some strong dramatic elements and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> the question as there's some really strong elements of drama." [...] Gyllenhaal particularly noted the comedic elements, commenting: [...] "Gilroy and I were laughing pretty much the whole movie." ...|$|E
2500|$|A nervous Bhansali, who had met {{the media}} after a long time, said he was very afraid of {{handling}} a mic after so long. He thanked UTV Chairman Ronnie Screwvala for his unrelenting support. Bhansali made headlines {{for the day when}} he said that Aishwarya Rai was [...] ".. his muse, his jaan, and I get terribly excited when I make a film with her because she is very, very special. Some people are timeless and Aishwarya will be there for another 20 years". About the lead actor he said, [...] "I have never enjoyed working with any other actor as much as I have enjoyed working with Hrithik, just for the kind of talent he has, for the kind of person he is". He also revealed the reason why he became the musical director of the movie, [...] "The reason behind doing the music of the film is that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> the characters and understand what they would express musically more than any other music director. Some deep thoughts are my concern, so whatever little music I knew, it was a sort of experiment. But I am happy with what I have done,".|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{see that}} the {{acceptances}} due next 4th are unusually heavy, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> {{you to say that}} you had spoken to Mr. Henshaw at the bank concerning these, and in any case I presume there would be no difficulty.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> the {{elements}} of Mrs. Sanderson's character at that time quite well, with one exception. Unfortunately, I stopped too soon in my analysis. I innocently {{took it for granted}} that she possessed a moral side to her worldly and perhaps frivolous nature. Here was my fatal mistake. <b>I</b> did not <b>understand</b> that the woman would unflinchingly sacrifice any one for selfish, momentary enjoyment.|$|R
60|$|LADY CHESHIRE. I do not. Neither do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> she {{has been}} trapped. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> nothing. <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> nothing.|$|R
6000|$|And Eustace {{answered}} reverently, [...] "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand.</b> Having come so near {{doing the}} same thing myself, I sympathize with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} good to me, Ned. Forgive me what I said just now. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> about Terence--poor dear old Terence." ...|$|E
60|$|PHOEBE (sadly). <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand.</b> I am afraid, Sergeant, you do {{not tell}} those poor young men the noble things I thought you told them.|$|E
6000|$|... "But, by Jove! <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> do <b>understand.</b> As sure {{as you are}} {{a living}} girl he will give back Castle Richmond to Herbert Fitzgerald." ...|$|R
40|$|Dear all, Here are the {{presentation}} given this week. If {{you have any}} technical problems with the Hawaiian Creole one let me know. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> {{that this was the}} version to upload. Again (yes, repeating myself!) I remind you of the very important rilevamenti appointment at 15. 30 in aula 7 next Monday. Please make an effort to come [...] . and to be on time! Thanks a lot and have a good week, d...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thank you," [...] {{returned}} Courtland coldly; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> already <b>understand</b> {{my duty to}} {{the company}} I represent and the Government I have served." ...|$|R
60|$|OCTAVIUS. No; but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> her. You {{must admit}} that your views are hardly suited for the {{formation}} of a young girl's mind and character.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thank you, Mr Mifflin.' There was a {{break in}} her laugh. 'I don't {{think there is any}} necessity. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> now. It was very clever of you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> how {{you feel}} about it," [...] and the young {{professor}} looked knowingly at the boy. [...] "Did you have much in the suitcase?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Such {{stories are}} not very quickly told; {{and in this case}} it was {{necessary}} to understand him very accurately. At length <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> do <b>understand</b> him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are not all}} alike, surely; so that <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> your question. We have no {{one like}} your brother--I may {{go so far as}} that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I daresay not; I daresay not. Men who {{begin as}} late as you did never know what {{official}} life really means. Now I've been at it all my life, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> do <b>understand</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then we will {{be friends}} again, Mr Gresham, won't we? It is so {{nice to have a}} friend like you. There, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> it now; you need not tell me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{heard your}} {{challenge}} to the creature you call Tars Tarkas, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> your position among these people, but what I cannot fathom is your statement {{that you are not}} of Barsoom." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Maybe. He surely has strange {{passion for}} horses. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> better than I used to. I owned {{a couple of}} racers once. They were just animals to me, I guess. But Blanco Sol!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> now <b>understand</b> the {{relative}} {{strength of the}} three parties in this State {{as well as any}} one man does, and my opinion is that to-day Buchanan has alone 85,000, Fremont 78,000, and Fillmore 21,000.|$|R
6000|$|... "You have spared me something," [...] he said. [...] "He has {{apparently}} undermined {{me with my}} own daughter. He has evidently given you an opinion of me which is his. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> can <b>understand</b> why you have not spoken of these--meetings." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I will. I do {{remember}} it. Mind you, aunt, I am not glad that I belong to it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> do <b>understand</b> about it all, {{and will do}} my best. But Jack {{would have made a}} better Earl than I shall do. That's the truth." ...|$|R
60|$|Personally, I {{have never}} known or met a Bishop in society in any other {{situation}} than just about to run. Where they run to, I do not know. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> what they run from.|$|E
6000|$|... "Warren, Rose loves you--not as {{she loved}} when a girl, {{but as a}} woman loves. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> your hesitancy--and I say you are wrong. You need her and you will do her good. You will develop her." ...|$|E
60|$|I've {{not said}} that. But I'm {{not going to}} let an appeal to my {{emotions}} interfere with my judgment. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> the situation. I'm not proposing to change my mind. I shall present Ronny's name to the Khedive to-morrow.|$|E
5000|$|When {{asked in}} 2007 how well Reality Bites had aged, Janeane Garofalo replied, [...] "I {{think it means}} a lot more to people younger than me. I was not the target audience. I was 29 playing a 21-year-old, so <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> why younger people like it." ...|$|R
60|$|I wandered {{about that}} night {{like a man who}} has {{discovered}} his Gods are dead. I can look back now detached yet sympathetic upon that wild confusion of moods and impulses, and by it <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> can <b>understand,</b> oh! half the wrongdoing and blundering in the world.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, it is, is it?" [...] {{the other}} responded, rubbing his head. [...] "It's deucedly interesting, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> would <b>understand</b> it better if I saw {{you do it}} to some one else. It is {{something}} between the explosion of a powder magazine and a natural convulsion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] said Cheyne, with {{a little}} gesture of resignation, [...] "I suppose it can be borne because it must be--and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand.</b> I know {{he must be a}} good man--or you would never have cared for him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One word, my dear, {{before you}} return to the ball-room. It may sound conceited, after the little you have told me; but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> your {{position}} now, better than you do yourself. Do {{you want to hear}} my opinion?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, Pat. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> now. And--oh, yes, there's {{another thing}} I {{want to ask}} you. What's the matter with Billie Sheldon? Uncle George said he was falling off in his game. Then I've read the papers. Billie started out well in the spring." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> you," [...] Mr. Sabin said, his {{piercing}} {{eyes raised}} {{now from the}} ground and fixed upon the other man's face. [...] "You have given me food for serious thought. I shall do nothing further till I have talked with you again." ...|$|R
60|$|But, as {{the days}} went by and Mr. Malcolm MacPherson began to insist on a date being set for the wedding, Aunt Olivia grew to have a strangely {{disturbed}} look. She became very quiet, and never laughed except under protest. Also, she showed signs of petulance when any of us, but especially father, teased her about her beau. I pitied her, for <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> better than the others what her feelings really were. But even I was not prepared for what did happen. I would not have believed that Aunt Olivia could do it. I thought that her desire for marriage in the abstract would outweigh the disadvantages of the concrete. But one can never reckon with real, bred-in-the-bone old-maidism.|$|R
60|$|Odd as {{the poor}} butcher's feeling appears, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> can <b>understand</b> it. Much {{as he would}} not have liked his boy's grave to be without a tombstone, had he died ashore and had a grave, so he can't bear him to drift to the depths of the ocean unrecorded.|$|R
