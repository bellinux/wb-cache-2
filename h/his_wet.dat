5|$|On Thursday, December 12, 1799, Washington {{spent several}} hours {{inspecting}} his plantation on horseback, in snow, hail, and freezing rain; that evening, he ate his supper without changing from <b>his</b> <b>wet</b> clothes. He awoke {{the next morning}} with a severe sore throat and became increasingly hoarse as the day progressed, yet still rode out in the heavy snow, marking trees for cutting on the plantation. Some time around 3a.m. that Saturday, he suddenly awoke with severe difficulty breathing and almost completely unable to speak or swallow. He was {{a firm believer in}} bloodletting, which was a standard medical practice of that era, and he had used it to treat various ailments of slaves on his plantation. He ordered estate overseer Albin Rawlins to remove nearly a pint of his blood.|$|E
25|$|The young prince was {{cared for}} by seven royal {{servants}} (two women and five men) throughout his childhood and youth. He grew up playing with children of his servants, including one Ye Htut, the eldest son of Mingyi Swe and <b>his</b> <b>wet</b> nurse Myo Myat. Ye Htut, who was three months older, would become Tabinshwehti's right-hand man.|$|E
25|$|Tutankhamun {{was the son}} of Akhenaten (formerly Amenhotep IV) and one of Akhenaten's sisters, or {{possibly}} one of his cousins. As a prince, he was known as Tutankhaten. He ascended to the throne in 1333 BC, at the age of nine or ten, taking the throne name Nebkheperure. <b>His</b> <b>wet</b> nurse was a woman called Maia, known from her tomb at Saqqara. His teacher was most likely Sennedjem.|$|E
60|$|He {{kept his}} seat, and shrank {{closer to the}} fire. Heathcliff rose, {{and went into the}} kitchen, and from thence to the yard, calling out for Hareton. Hareton responded, and {{presently}} the two re-entered. The young man had been washing himself, as was visible by the glow on his cheeks and <b>his</b> <b>wetted</b> hair.|$|R
60|$|Mahbub felt in <b>his</b> belt, <b>wetted</b> <b>his</b> {{thumb on}} a cake of Chinese ink, and dabbed the {{impression}} {{on a piece}} of soft native paper. From Balkh to Bombay men know that rough-ridged print with the old scar running diagonally across it.|$|R
60|$|At {{the little}} {{fountain}} {{in the plaza}} he made an apology for a toilet with <b>his</b> <b>wetted</b> handkerchief. Across the open square filed the dolorous line of friends to the prisoners in the calaboza, bearing the morning meal of the immured. The food in their hands aroused small longing in Blythe. It was drink that his soul craved, or money to buy it.|$|R
25|$|In the March 1851 {{issue of}} The Chemist, Frederick Scott Archer {{published}} <b>his</b> <b>wet</b> plate collodion process. It {{became the most}} widely used photographic medium until the gelatin dry plate, introduced in the 1870s, eventually replaced it. There are three subsets to the collodion process; the Ambrotype (a positive image on glass), the Ferrotype or Tintype (a positive image on metal) and the glass negative, which was used to make positive prints on albumen or salted paper.|$|E
25|$|Koxinga {{was born}} to Zheng Zhilong, a Chinese {{merchant}} and pirate, and Tagawa Matsu, a Japanese woman, in 1624 in Hirado, Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan. He was raised there until seven and moved to Quanzhou, in the Fujian province of China. In a family made wealthy from shipping and piracy, Koxinga inherited his father's trade networks, which stretched from Nagasaki to Macao. Following the Manchu advance on Fujian, Koxinga retreated from his stronghold in Amoy (Xiamen) and besieged Taiwan {{in the hope of}} establishing a strategic base to marshal his troops to retake his base at Amoy. In 1662, following a nine-month siege, Koxinga captured the Dutch fortress Zeelandia and Taiwan became his base (see Kingdom of Tungning). The Taiwanese Aboriginal tribes who were previously allied with the Dutch against the Chinese during the Guo Huaiyi Rebellion in 1652 turned against the Dutch during the Siege of Fort Zeelandia and defected to Koxinga's Chinese forces. The Aboriginals (Formosans) of Sincan defected to Koxinga after he offered them amnesty, the Sincan Aboriginals then proceeded to work for the Chinese and behead Dutch people in executions, the frontier aboriginals in the mountains and plains also surrendered and defected to the Chinese on May 17, 1661, celebrating their freedom from compulsory education under the Dutch rule by hunting down Dutch people and beheading them and trashing their Christian school textbooks. Koxinga died four months after the siege was over, there were speculations that he died in a sudden fit of madness when his officers refused to carry out his orders to execute his son Zheng Jing. Zheng Jing had an affair with <b>his</b> <b>wet</b> nurse and conceived a child with her. Other accounts are more straightforward, attributing Koxinga's death to a case of malaria.|$|E
500|$|Pedro I invited Dona Mariana de Verna Magalhães Coutinho (later Countess of Belmonte in 1844) to {{take the}} {{position}} of aia (supervisor) to his son. Mariana de Verna was a Portuguese widow who was considered a cultured, honorable and kindly woman. Pedro II called her [...] "Dadama" [...] as he did not pronounce the word [...] "dame" [...] correctly as a child. However, he would continue calling her in this way into adulthood, though out of affection and treating her as his surrogate mother. As was the custom of the time, he was not nursed by his mother. Instead, a Swiss immigrant from the Morro do Queimado colony ("Burnt Hill", now Nova Friburgo) {{by the name of}} Marie Catherine Equey was chosen as <b>his</b> <b>wet</b> nurse.|$|E

500|$|The fictional {{journalist}} Bridget Jones (in reality Helen Fielding of The Independent) {{wrote of}} her love of the serial in the paper's Bridget Jones's Diary column during the original British broadcast, mentioning her [...] "simple human need for Darcy to get off with Elizabeth" [...] and regarding the couple as her [...] "chosen representatives {{in the field of}} shagging, or rather courtship". Fielding loosely reworked the plot of Pride And Prejudice in her 1996 novel of the column, naming Bridget's uptight love interest [...] "Mark Darcy" [...] and describing him exactly like Colin Firth. Following a first meeting with Firth during his filming of Fever Pitch in 1996, Fielding asked Firth to collaborate in what would become a multi-page interview between Bridget Jones and Firth in her 1999 sequel novel, [...] Conducting the real interview with Firth in Rome, Fielding lapsed into Bridget Jones mode and obsessed over Darcy in <b>his</b> <b>wet</b> shirt for the fictional interview. Firth participated in the editing of what critics called [...] "one of the funniest sequences in the diary's sequel". Both novels make various other references to the BBC serial.|$|E
500|$|On 14 December, {{the party}} {{were more than}} [...] from the Cape Denison hut. As Mertz skied ahead, singing songs from his student days, Ninnis, the largest sledge and the strongest dog team were lost when they broke through the snow lid of a crevasse. Together {{with the death of}} their companion, Mawson and Mertz were now {{severely}} compromised; on the remaining sledge they had just ten days' worth of food, and no food for the dogs. They immediately turned back west, gradually using the six remaining dogs to supplement their food supply; they ate all parts of the animals, including their livers. They initially made good progress, but as they cleared the largest glacier Mertz began to feel ill; he had lost his waterproof overpants on Ninnis' sledge, and in the cold <b>his</b> <b>wet</b> clothes were unable to dry. On 30 December, a day Mawson recorded that the companion was [...] "off colour", Mertz wrote that he was [...] "really tired [...] shall write no more." [...] Mertz's condition deteriorated over the following days—Mawson recorded he was [...] "generally in a very bad condition. Skin coming off legs, etc"—and his illness severely slowed their progress. On 8 January, the pair about [...] from the hut, Mawson recorded: ...|$|E
500|$|The attack began {{early on}} the morning of November 11. Some overeager Indians spoiled the {{surprise}} by firing on settlers cutting wood nearby. [...] One of them escaped, raising the alarm. [...] Little Beard led some of the Senecas to surround the Wells house, while the main body surrounded the fort. [...] The attackers killed at least sixteen officers and troops of the quarters guards, including Alden, who was cut down while he was running from the Wells house to the fort. Most accounts say Alden was within reach of the gates, only to stop and try to shoot his pursuer, who may have been Joseph Brant. <b>His</b> <b>wet</b> pistol repeatedly misfired and he was killed by a thrown tomahawk hitting him in the forehead. [...] Lt. Col. William Stacy, second in command, also quartered at the Wells house, was taken prisoner. Stacy's son Benjamin and cousin Rufus Stacy ran through a hail of bullets to reach the fort from the house; Stacy's brother-in-law Gideon Day was killed. [...] Those attacking the Wells house eventually gained entry, leading to hand-to-hand combat inside. After killing most of the soldiers stationed there, the Senecas slaughtered the entire Wells household, twelve in all.|$|E

2500|$|Bilancia {{was born}} in Potenza, Basilicata, in 1951. When he was about five years old, {{his family moved to}} {{northern}} Italy, first to Piedmont and then to Genoa in the Liguria region. [...] He was a chronic bedwetter until age 10 or 12, and his mother shamed him by placing <b>his</b> <b>wet</b> mattress on the balcony where it could be seen by the neighbors. [...] When undressing him for bed, his aunt would shame him by pulling down his underwear in front of his cousins to show his underdeveloped penis. [...] At age 14, he decided to start calling himself Walter. [...] He {{dropped out of high school}} and worked at jobs such as mechanic, bartender, baker and delivery boy.|$|E

[...] His father, Galen Fogerty, was a native of South Dakota and worked as a Linotype {{operator}} for the Berkeley Gazette. Lucile Fogerty was from Great Falls, Montana. When John was two years old his parents both converted to Catholicism. He first attended a Catholic school in Berkeley named the [...] "School of the Madeleine". In his memoir, Fortunate Son, Fogerty was critical of the school, saying [...] he was not permitted {{to go to the bathroom}} when he asked and frequently wet himself in the classroom and was forced to sit in <b>his</b> <b>wet</b> clothing.|$|E
2500|$|Senna {{has often}} been voted as {{the best and most}} {{influential}} [...] Formula One driver of all time in various motorsport polls. He was recognised for his qualifying speed over one lap, and from 1989 until 2006 he held the record for most pole positions. He was also acclaimed for <b>his</b> <b>wet</b> weather performances, such as the 1984 Monaco Grand Prix, the 1985 Portuguese Grand Prix, and the 1993 European Grand Prix. He holds a record six victories at the Monaco Grand Prix, and is the fifth-most successful driver of all time in terms of race wins. Senna courted controversy throughout his career, particularly during his turbulent rivalry with Prost. In the Japanese Grands Prix of 1989 and 1990, each of which decided the championship of that year, collisions between Senna and Prost determined the eventual winner.|$|E
2500|$|Aside {{from the}} legend that Pilate {{had made an}} image of Christ, the 4th-century Eusebius of Caesarea, in his Church History, {{provides}} a more substantial reference to a [...] "first" [...] icon of Jesus. [...] He relates that King [...] Abgar of Edessa (died ca 50 CE) {{sent a letter to}} Jesus at Jerusalem, asking Jesus to come and heal him of an illness. [...] In this version there is no image. [...] A later account found in the Syriac Doctrine of Addai (ca. 400 ?) mentions a painted image of Jesus in the story; and even later, in the 6th-century account given by Evagrius Scholasticus, the painted image transforms into an image that miraculously appeared on a towel when Christ pressed the cloth to <b>his</b> <b>wet</b> face. Further legends relate that the cloth remained in Edessa until the 10th century, when it was taken to Constantinople. It went missing in 1204 when [...] Crusaders sacked Constantinople, but by then numerous copies had firmly established its iconic type.|$|E

2500|$|The raiders {{split up}} at this point, and in the confusion, Boyce was left behind with the lorry driving without him. He was not yet {{concerned}} about being pursued and was walking to the lorry, keeping a lookout for stragglers, when it suddenly took off when he was 50 yards away. He ran after the lorry {{but was unable to}} catch up. He then unsuccessfully tried to break into an RUC car parked nearby before resigning to walk the 20 miles back to the border. Boyce got as far as the Clogher Valley area, and while taking off his boiler suit in a ditch, he was captured by a Protestant farmer and his five sons, all of whom were heavily armed. He experienced some degree of police brutality following his capture, being [...] "cuffed about" [...] and forced to dress and undress in <b>his</b> <b>wet</b> clothes six times, before being transported back to Omagh to stand trial. At his trial, which he and his men refused to recognise, Boyce told the court [...] "This war was not waged against any Irishman, but against a foreign Queen who has no right to have her forces on our soil." [...] The 27-year-old Boyce, who was identified by authorities as the leader in the raid, was sentenced to twelve years penal servitude in Belfast Gaol. The rest of the men involved received ten years each.|$|E
