50|$|Georges Jean Marie Darrieus (24 September 1888 - 15 July 1979) was a French {{aeronautical}} engineer in the 20th century. He {{is perhaps most}} famous for his invention of the <b>Darrieus</b> <b>rotor,</b> a wind turbine capable of operating from any direction and under adverse weather conditions, and the vertical-axis giromill.|$|E
50|$|Drag-type VAWTs {{such as the}} Savonius rotor {{typically}} {{operate at}} lower tipspeed ratios than lift-based VAWTs such as <b>Darrieus</b> <b>rotors</b> and cycloturbines.|$|R
50|$|When {{the rotor}} is stationary, no net {{rotational}} force arises, {{even if the}} wind speed rises quite high—the rotor must already be spinning to generate torque. Thus the design is not normally self-starting. Under rare conditions, <b>Darrieus</b> <b>rotors</b> can self-start, so some form of brake is required to hold it when stopped.|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} a three-tier {{configuration}} for a vertical axis rotor was successfully developed into a experimental model. The rotor assembly {{is divided into three}} tiers with three straight blades in each tier. The three-tiers are shifted by an angle of 400 generating a full helical flow field inside the rotor. Thereby the new configuration has some different mechanism of torque generation as other <b>Darrieus</b> <b>rotors.</b> The three-tier configuration facilitates the operation by enabling the turbine to self-start at wind velocity as low as 2 m/s with good performance and a smoother driving torque. At the same time the design couples an esthetic appearance with low noise level...|$|R

To this belongs a 1989 erected Enercon E-17 with 28 m hub height, 17 m rotor {{diameter}} and 80 kW power and a 25 m high <b>Darrieus</b> <b>rotor</b> with 15 m diameter which has an output of 55 kW.|$|E
50|$|When the <b>Darrieus</b> <b>rotor</b> is spinning, the {{aerofoils}} {{are moving}} forward {{through the air}} in a circular path. Relative to the blade, this oncoming airflow is added vectorially to the wind, so that the resultant airflow creates a varying small positive angle of attack (AoA) to the blade. This generates a net force pointing obliquely forwards along a certain 'line-of-action'. This force can be projected inwards past the turbine axis at a certain distance, giving a positive torque to the shaft, thus helping it to rotate in the direction it is already travelling in. The aerodynamic principles which rotate the rotor are equivalent to that in autogiros, and normal helicopters in autorotation.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1984 An {{analytical}} model {{leading to the}} pressure distribution on the cross section of a <b>Darrieus</b> <b>Rotor</b> Blade (airfoil) was constructed. The model {{was based on the}} inviscid flow theory and the contribution of the nonsteady wake vortices was neglected. The {{analytical model}} was translated into a computer code in order to study a variety of boundary conditions encountered by the rotating blades of the <b>Darrieus</b> <b>Rotor.</b> The results of the program indicate that for a pitching airfoil, lift can be adequately approximated by the Kutta-Joukowski forces, despite notable deviations in the pressure distribution on the airfoil. These deviations are most significant at the upwind half of the <b>Darrieus</b> <b>Rotor</b> where higher lift is accompanied by increased adverse pressure gradients. It was also found that the effect of pitching on lift can be approximated by a linear shift in the angle of attack proportional to the blade angular velocity. Finally, the fluid velocity about the pitching-only NACA 0015 was tabulated; thus allowing the principle of superposition to be used {{in order to determine the}} fluid velocity about a translating and pitching airfoil...|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} types of open-ﬂow devices {{that can be used}} in marine-current-power applications; many of them are modern {{descendants}} of the waterwheel or similar. However, the more technically sophisticated designs, derived from wind-power rotors, are the most likely to achieve enough cost-effectiveness and reliability to be practical in a massive marine-current-power future scenario. Even though there is no generally accepted term for these open-ﬂow hydro-turbines, some sources refer to them as water-current turbines. There are two main types of water current turbines that might be considered: axial-ﬂow horizontal-axis propellers (with both variable-pitch or ﬁxed-pitch), and cross-ﬂow vertical-axis <b>Darrieus</b> <b>rotors.</b> Both rotor types may be combined with any of the three main methods for supporting water-current turbines:ﬂoating moored systems, sea-bed mounted systems, and intermediate systems. Sea-bed-mounted monopile structures constitute the ﬁrst-generation marine current power systems. They have the advantage of using existing (and reliable) engineering know-how, but they are limited to relatively shallow waters (about 20 to 40 m depth).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the experimental {{results of the}} {{vertical axis wind turbine}} (VAWT), especially the Savonius rotors, which are developed for application on top of buildings due to lower wind speed compared with remote areas. The VAWT is regarded as the most suitable elegant candidate to be integrated with buildings for its relatively low operating noise, easy maintenance, and easy access. This study explored the interaction effect of the overlap ratio, phase-shift, and stage on the performance of the Savonius rotors in details. The results show that appropriate choice of the phase-shift angle according to the overlap ratio can not only increase the power coefficient of the Savonius rotors but also eliminate the negative static torque and smooth the variation of the static torque coefficient. Moreover, the performance of the two-stage rotors indicates that the two-stage rotor is the best candidate for this type of wind turbines or as a starting assistant for the <b>Darrieus</b> <b>rotors.</b> Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R

In view of a performance optimization of <b>Darrieus</b> <b>rotors,</b> the application of a pitch angle to blades has been often suggested. In the present work, the pitch modeling in an advanced BEM code has been exploited to investigate different pitch control strategies. In particular, the prospects of a pitch preset based on both the maximum power and the maximum energy extraction have been evaluated and compared to those connected to a progressive pitch variation with the turbine revolution speed. The pitch effects have been discussed both in terms of aggregated power output and of variation of the airfoil functioning conditions throughout a revolution. The analysis confirmed that the application of a proper pitch angle could definitely provide an increase of the turbine performance, especially at medium-high solidities...|$|R

The wind turbine was run at the design tip speed ratio of 5. 5. It was found that the wake decayed at a slower rate with distance downstream of the turbine, than a wake from a screen with similar troposkein shape and drag force characteristics as the <b>Darrieus</b> <b>rotor.</b> The initial wind tunnel results indicated that the vertical axis wind turbines should be spaced at least forty diameters apart to avoid mutual power depreciation greater than ten per cent...|$|E
40|$|The {{strong and}} stable wind at {{offshore}} locations {{and the increasing}} demand for energy have made the application of wind turbines in deeper water surge. A novel concept of a 5 MW baseline Floating Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (FVAWT) and a 5 MW optimised FVAWT with the DeepWind <b>Darrieus</b> <b>rotor</b> and the optimised DeepWind <b>Darrieus</b> <b>rotor,</b> respectively, were studied extensively. The structural responses, fatigue damages, platform global motions and mooring line dynamics of the FVAWTs were investigated comprehensively during normal operating conditions under steady wind and turbulent wind conditions, using a coupled non-linear aero-hydro-servo-elastic code (the Simo-Riflex-DMS code) which was developed by Wang et al. for modeling FVAWTs. This coupled code incorporates the models for the turbulent wind field, aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, structural dynamics, and generator controller. The simulation is performed in a fully coupled manner in time domain. The comparison of responses under different wind conditions were used to demonstrate the effect of turbulence on both FVAWTs dynamic responses. The turbulent wind condition {{has the advantage of}} reducing the 2 P effects. Furthermore, comparative studies of the FVAWTs responses were undertaken to explore the advantages of adopting the optimised 5 MW DeepWind <b>Darrieus</b> <b>rotor</b> over the baseline model. The results identified the 5 MW optimised FVAWT to having: lower Fore-Aft (FA) but higher lower Side-Side (SS) bending moments of structural components; lower motions amplitude; lower short-term fatigue equivalent loads and a further reduced 2 P effects...|$|E
30|$|Vertical-axis wind {{turbines}} (VAWTs) include both a drag-type configuration, {{such as the}} Savonius rotor, and a lift-type configuration, such as the <b>Darrieus</b> <b>rotor.</b> The simplest type of vertical-axis wind turbine is the Savonius rotor, the operation of which depends on the difference in drag force when the wind strikes either the convex or concave part of its semi-cylindrical blades. Savonius rotors are good at self-starting and work independently of wind direction. However, its efficiency is relatively {{lower than that of}} the lift-type VAWTs. Due to its simple design and low construction cost, Savonius rotors are primarily used to pump water and generate wind power on a small scale, and its large starting torque makes it suitable for starting other types of {{wind turbines}} that have inferior starting characteristics, such as the <b>Darrieus</b> <b>rotor</b> and Gyro mill[1]. Recently, some generators with high torque at low rotational speed, suitable for small-scale wind turbines, have been developed, suggesting that Savonius rotors may yet be used to generate electric power[1].|$|E
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs) still lacks {{from those of}} horizontal-axis rotors (HAWTs). To improve on efficiency, more accurate and robust aerodynamic simulation tools are needed for VAWTs, for which low-order methods have not reached yet a maturity {{comparable to that of}} HAWTs' applications. In the present study, the VARDAR research code, based on the BEM theory, is used to critically compare the predictiveness of some dynamic stall models for Darrieus wind turbines. Dynamic stall, connected to the continuous variation of the angle of attack on the airfoils, has indeed a major impact on the performance of <b>Darrieus</b> <b>rotors.</b> Predicted lift and drag coefficients of the airfoils in motion are reconstructed with the different dynamic stall models and compared to unsteady CFD simulations, previously validated by means of experimental data. The results show that low-order models are unfortunately not able to capture all the complex phenomena taking place during a VAWT functioning. It is however shown that the selection of the adequate dynamic stall model can definitely lead to a much better modelling of the real airfoils' behavior and then notably enhance the predictiveness of low-order simulation methods...|$|R
40|$|Despite several {{potential}} advantages, {{relatively few}} studies and design support tools {{have been developed}} for floating VAWTs. Due to the substantial aerodynamics differences, the analyses of VAWT on floating structures cannot be easily extended from what have been already done for HAWTs. Therefore, the main aim of the present work is to compare the dynamic response of the FOWT system adopting two different mooring dynamics approaches. Two version of the in-house aero-hydro-mooring coupled model of dynamics for VAWT (FloVAWT) have been used, using: a mooring quasi-static model, which solves the equations using an energetic approach, and a modified version of FloVAWT, which instead couples with the lumped mass mooring line model MoorDyn.

40|$|The reverse {{force on}} the {{returning}} blade of a water turbine can be reduced by setting a deflector on the returning blade side of a rotor.

The placing of Savonius in <b>Darrieus</b> <b>rotor</b> is carried out by setting the Savonius bucket in <b>Darrieus</b> <b>rotor</b> at the same axis. The combination of these rotors is also called a Darrieus-Savonius turbine. This rotor can improve torque of turbine. Experiments are conducted in an irrigation canal to find the performance characteristics of presence of deflector and Savonius rotor in Darrieus-Savonius turbine. Results conclude that the single deflector plate placed on returning blade side increases the torque and power coefficient.

40|$|Abstract — A {{combined}} savonius and darrieus {{vertical axis}} wind turbine would have many advantages over an individual savonius or <b>darrieus</b> <b>rotor.</b> A savonius produces high torque {{which would be}} useful in self-starting and <b>darrieus</b> <b>rotor</b> having a high tip speed ratio useful for electrical generation. However research on combined savonius and darrieus rotors is very scarce. This developed a two bucket savonius rotor {{and placed it on the}} central shaft of a traditional darrieus. Though the tip speed ratio is a still a little low for use as an electrical generator, the research demonstrated a simple way to enable a darrieus VAWT to be self-starting and achieve higher efficiencies. Historically VAWTs cost more to operate and maintain than HAWTs Finally, traditional Darrieus rotors are not self-starting under most of wind conditions and manufacture of their blades is a challenge because of the complex shape which adds expense to the turbine. However, evidence shows that a Darrieus turbine using fixed geometry symmetrical airfoils can self-start in the field during atmospheric gusting it was suggested that using a Darrieus blade together with a Savonius blade has better performance than using them individually according to self-start ability and efficiency of the turbine. Using a counter rotating wind turbine with a freely rotating generator can produce higher amounts of power than common wind generators...|$|E
40|$|The {{interest}} in floating offshore wind turbines (FOWT) {{has been growing}} substantially {{over the last decade}} and, after a number of prototypes deployed [1], the first offshore floating wind farms have been approved and are being developed. While a number of international research activities have been conducted on the dynamics of offshore floating HAWT systems (e. g. OC 3 -Phase IV 2, OC 4 -Phase II 3), relatively few studies have been conducted on floating VAWT systems, despite their potential advantages [2]. Due to the substantial differences between HAWT and VAWT aerodynamics, the analyses on floating HAWT cannot be extended to floating VAWT systems. The main aim of the present work is to compare the dynamic response of the FOWT system adopting two different mooring dynamics approaches. Two version of the in-house aero-hydromooring coupled model of dynamics for VAWT “FloVAWT” [3] are used: one which adopts a mooring quasi-static model, and solves the equations using an energetic approach [4], and a modified version of FloVAWT, which uses instead the lumpedmass mooring line model “MoorDyn” [5]. The floating VAWT system considered is based on a 5 MW <b>Darrieus</b> type <b>rotor</b> supported by the OC 4 -Phase II 3 semi-submersible. The results for the considered metocean conditions show that MoorDyn approach estimate larger translational displacements of the platform, compared to the quasi-static rigid approach previously implemented in FloVAWT. As expected, the magnitudes of the forces along the lines are lower, being part of the energy employed for the elastic deformation of the cables.

In this study, a Navier-Stokes CFD research code featuring a very high parallel efficiency was used to thoroughly investigate the three-dimensional unsteady aerodynamics of a <b>Darrieus</b> <b>rotor</b> blade. Highly spatially and temporally resolved unsteady simulations were carried out using more than 16, 000 processor cores on an IBM BG/Q cluster.

A comparison of the CFD integral estimates and the results of a blade-element momentum code is also presented to highlight strengths and weaknesses of low-fidelity codes for Darrieus turbine design.

40|$|The Savonius rotor {{seems to}} be a {{promising}} wind turbine as it not only has the simplest and cheapest design but also is capable of yielding a higher annual energy output at low wind speed than the <b>Darrieus</b> <b>rotor.</b> Moreover, the Savonius rotor can also be used in ventilation systems, for local electricity production, as the start-up device for the <b>Darrieus</b> <b>rotor,</b> and small hydrokinetic turbines operating at low velocity. As a two-blade Savonius rotor suffers from negative average static torque coefficient (ACTS) at some azimuth angles and large-amplitude variation of ACTS, several studies have been conducted in recent years to improve ACTS. The three-blade rotor {{seems to be}} a potential candidate for ACTS improvement. However, less research has been done on three-blade rotors with a 180 ° arc and central shaft at different gap ratios (GRs) for different wind speeds. Therefore, the focus of the present work is to compare the two- and three-blade rotor in terms of ACTS and power coefficient (CP) through a wind tunnel experiment. Results show that the wind speed had a small effect on ACTS. However, negative azimuth angle range is narrowed and the negative azimuth angle range is moved upward as GR increased. Hence, the Savonius rotor with three blades could not only eliminate the negative range of ACTS but also smooth ACTS curves. In terms of the CP, the maximum power coefficient of the two-blade configuration was approximately 1. 5 times that of the three-blade configuration.

The concepts introduced here involve the constructive aspects of variable-geometry oval-trajectory (VGOT) Darrieus wind turbines.

Each wagon contains its own electrical generation system coupled to the power-wheels and the electricity is collected by a classical third rail system. The VGOT concept allows increasing the area swept by the blades, and hence the power output of the installation, without the structural problems and the low rotational speed associated with a classical <b>Darrieus</b> <b>rotor</b> of large diameter.

40|$|A {{practical}} Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWTs) {{based on}} a <b>Darrieus</b> <b>rotor</b> has been designed and tested and found {{to be capable of}} self-starting at wind speeds above 4 m/s. The self-start feature has been achieved by replacing the usual symmetrical aerofoil blade in the VAWT rotor and by using a concentric Savonius rotor or semi-cylinder turbine. A computer program was produced to compute the power coefficient versus tip speed ratio characteristics of a selected aerofoil profile employed in a VAWT. The program accounts for chord length, pitch angle, number of blades, and rotor radius at any wind speed. The published data from 40 aerofoil sections were assessed, taking into account the two main criteria — self-starting and efficiency. Computational fluid dynamics software (ANSYS, Flotran) has been used to investigate the lift and drag performance of a NACA 66 - 212 and NACA 4421 aerofoils in order to check the computer program predictions. Excellent agreement was obtained for the static aerofoil assessment, but only after special ICEM Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) meshing interface routines were utilised. However, agreement between the theoretical and published results was not good for the rotating aerofoils in a VAWT. Thus, further CFD work was not pursued and in preference, an experimental route was initiated. In the first series of wind tunnel tests involving three candidate profiles, good agreement was found between the experimental results and the mathematical models. The aerofoils chosen were the NACA 661 - 212, the 51223 and the Clark-Y standard aerofoils. A number of prototype VAWTs were fabricated and tested for the influence of the blade pitch angle, the chord length ratio, with 2 or 3 blades. The aerofoil surfaces were made from aluminium sheet with a standard surface finish. The prototype designs were tested in the Northumbria University low speed wind tunnel facility - the models were 0. 4 m. high with a 0. 4 m diameter. The torque versus wind speed characteristics were recorded and analysed. The S 1223 profile was found to be self-starting with high efficiency. This model generated a high power coefficient of about 0. 3 at a tip speed ratio of 1. 2. The second series of tests were carried out in field sites in the UK with a 2 m diameter straight—bladed <b>Darrieus</b> <b>rotor</b> prototype with 3 blades using the S 1223 blade section. Three field trials were undertaken in the UK to produce realistic performance characteristics for wind conditions of 4 - 10 m/s. The maximum power coefficient of this machine was found to be 0. 18 at a tip speed ratio of 1. 2. In addition, an alternative semi-cylinder turbine combined with a <b>Darrieus</b> <b>rotor</b> was fabricated and tested in the UK. It demonstrated the advantage that it could self-start at lower wind speeds, that is 3 m/s but delivers approximately 50 % less power than that obtained from the first proposed design. A final phase of testing was carried out with an enlarged and modified 3 m diameter prototype installed at a shrimp farm in Thailand to demonstrate how the unit could be used to replace an equivalent 2 HP 2 -stroke diesel engine and hence eliminate its inherent emission pollution problems. A Savonius rotor was fitted to the prototype to improve self-start capabilities at a wind speed of 4 m/s for a practical application which by its nature required a high starting torque. The designs are easy to fabricate, low cost, pollution free and have been demonstrated to be ideal for applications in developing countries where there are sufficient wind resources.
