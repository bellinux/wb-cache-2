3000|$|... “Maker” {{scenarios}} or “FabLabs” (<b>Fabrication</b> <b>Laboratories)</b> {{have been}} identified as a basis for new educational approaches (Blikstein & Krannich, 2013) where the maker culture extends beyond the actual products to the process of creating an artefact in a social arena (Dougherty, 2012; Sharples, McAndrew, Weller, Ferguson, Fitzgerald et al., 2013). During this process, makers learn how to search and to choose appropriate information, how to apply it in order to solve problems, how to communicate and collaborate in the community and how to evaluate one’s own practice.|$|R

40|$|Fab Labs, <b>fabrication</b> <b>laboratories,</b> {{are shared}} {{workshops}} where citizens can access digital fabrication equipment {{to design and}} make their own objects. They are proliferating rapidly and represent an alternative to mass production and consumption, an ideology whose environmental and social benefits their "makers" like to espouse. A longitudinal ethnographic study in a Fab Lab in a European design school examined the Lab's ideology building, how ideals were enacted and where compromises were visible. Environmental issues were intertwined with other ideological concerns, but they were rarely promoted in their own right. Engagement with sustainability-oriented makers and stakeholders is recommended...|$|R
