40|$|In Electroleum, {{the player}} uses {{the ability of}} {{electricity}} {{to get to the}} end of the level by manipulating level features as well as for killing enemy bots. Your ability of electricity is necessary for manipulating objects in the level vital for completion of the level (the tutorial is intended to get you accustomed to this procedure). Some of the level features requiring electricity manipulation include: magnetic-plated blocks critical for assisted movement across impassable areas; keypads, which must be zapped to control moving platforms or deactivated  to disable level barriers; windfields, which must be directed in a fashion critical to your trajectory. Keeping these specifics in mind will make for easy gameplay. However, getting to the end will not be that easy, as the combination of level features will create dexterity challenges. Also, beware the killer bots, and the leaking pipelines, as they are deadly. Coming into to contact with these will kill you, but <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>worry</b> for you <b>are</b> <b>not</b> easily defeated as level checkpoints will save your last static state, which you are respawned upon dying.

Be patient; you have but a little while to wait; the possible reports are nearly all in.

It has been reported that I have received a legacy it was another man; that I am out of debt--it was another man; and now comes this $82,000--still another man.

What had I done? What crime had I committed against the good citizens of Niagara Falls that all this vengeance should be wreaked upon me? I had not even violated their [...] "sleeping-out" [...] ordinance. I had slept outside their jurisdiction, in the country, that night.

And what crime was there in that? Technically I was guilty of no misdemeanor. All right, I'd show them when I got out.|$|R

Blowing and breathing, exhaling and inhaling, expelling the old and taking in the new, bear strides and bird stretches—all this is merely indicative of the desire for longevity. But it is favored by scholars who channel the vital breath and flex the muscles and joints, men who nourish the physical form so as to emulate the hoary age of Progenitor P'eng Peng Zu. (15, tr. Mair 1994:145) Mair previously (1991:159) noted the (c. 168 BCE) Mawangdui Silk Texts, famous for two Daodejing manuscripts, include a painted text that illustrates gymnastic exercises-including the [...] "odd expression 'bear strides'." ...|$|R
