40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss the {{differences}} between accounting for <b>fixed</b> <b>assets</b> <b>under</b> IFRS and U. S. GAAP. Primarily the discussion will be driven by the question: which standard should the FASB lobby for in its joint effort with the IASB to converge U. S. GAAP with IFRS? The paper will start by establishing that financial reporting, as it has evolved in the United States, was developed primarily to assist in the accountability relationships between management and both credit and equity investors. From there the paper will look at which standard is better suited to fulfill this goal and enhance financial reporting. It will first discuss the differences of historical cost accounting versus market values in the income statement. Next, the paper will look at the differences created in the balance sheet by the two methods. Finally, the paper will consider additional implications of switching to a market value standard. This paper will attempt to prove that historical cost accounting is the more reliable method of the two, provides an equally if not more relevant income measure, and that market values do not enhance the financial statements in any clear way. Particularly in any fashion that justifies the additional costs to the firm and to investors in debt and equity that market values would create...|$|R

40|$|Some {{standards}} {{permit a}} choice between different measurement bases. IAS 16 and IAS 40 allow entities to choose between fair value and cost-based measurement for property, plant and equipment (PPE) and investment property (IP), respectively. This study analyzes the accounting practice concerning measurement of PPE and IP after recognition, under IFRS. The sample was extracted from stock exchange listed European companies included in the S&P Europe 350 Index. Data was hand collected from firm’s annual reports for the years of 2004 and 2005. Findings indicate great resistance to the fair value model. The preference for historical cost model is almost unanimous among European firms that prepared their consolidated financial statements in compliance with IFRS {{for the first time}} in 2005. Results seem to be consistent with the explanation that invokes the familiarity as being one of the reasons underlying the preparers’ preference for historical cost. That is, firms that applied historical cost model under former GAAP tend to carry on with historical cost under IFRS. Firms that had revaluate <b>fixed</b> <b>assets</b> before or at the transition date are more likely to adopt fair value model under IFRS. However, most of the companies that reported tangible <b>fixed</b> <b>assets</b> revaluations <b>under</b> previous GAAP shift to historical model under IFRS...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) is to provide useful information to the users of financial statements to assist in making economic decisions. To be useful, information has to be relevant and reliable, but the reliability of information suffers when the guidelines for the reporting of specific issues are not clear and managerial discretion arises. Write-offs are one of those accounting issues that are regularly related to earnings management. By now {{it is seen as}} common knowledge that write-offs, especially those on goodwill, do not reflect declines in asset value; rather, they are used as a device to manipulate financial reports. However, there is a striking lack of grounded theoretical research that can confirm this assessment. The aim of this dissertation is to provide valuable analytical and empirical insights on <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> write-offs <b>under</b> IFRS. In a first step, the practical implementation of IAS 36 in Europe has to be analyzed, which is best done empirically. Based on the findings from these empirical surveys, the most substantial questions remaining are subject to an in-depth analytical discussion. Since IAS 36 entails different measurement issues that have their origins in finance theory, this dissertation also aims to introduce some basic techniques from theoretical finance to accounting research. Lastly, as the analyses presented in this dissertation do not cover all open questions on <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> write-offs, the author hopes to encourage further research on this important topic...|$|R

We show, however, that a parsimonious rational model can generate a discount that exhibits many of the characteristics observed in practice.

The results of the research: The differences in the measurement of accounting figures under IFRS and EAS may directly affect the numerator of ratio calculations, their denominator, or both. In cases where the difference in measurement affects only the numerator or only the denominator, the effect of the changes is straightforward, easy to identify and to interpret. Identification and interpretation are less obvious in cases of numerous diverging effects on ratios.

40|$|Data on {{physical}} capital are an indispensable part {{of economic growth}} and efficiency studies. In the case of China, economy-wide <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> series are usually derived by aggregating gross fixed capital formation (net of depreciation) over time, and sectoral/ownership-specific series by correcting the limited official <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> data available. These procedures, to varying degrees, ignore that (i) gross fixed capital formation does not equal investment, (ii) investment does not equal the value of <b>fixed</b> <b>assets</b> newly created through investment, (iii) depreciation is an accounting measure that bears no necessary relation {{to changes in the}} production capacity of <b>fixed</b> <b>assets,</b> (iv) official <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> data, where available, incorporate significant revaluations in the 1990 s, and (v) "net fixed assets" do not measure the contribution of <b>fixed</b> <b>assets</b> to production. This paper derives economy-wide <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> values for 1953 - 2003, correcting for these shortcomings. It uses both the traditional, cumulative approach and a new, so far unexplored method of combining economy-wide depreciation values and an economy-wide depreciation rate to directly yield economy-wide <b>fixed</b> <b>assets.</b> The derived <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> time series are evaluated in a comparison with each other as well as with series in the literature, leading to the recommendation of a specific choice of <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> time series.
