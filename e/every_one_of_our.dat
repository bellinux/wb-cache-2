Martin commented that she was extraordinary in her audition, in which she read the scene where Shae meets Tyrion in a tent the night before the battle of the Green Fork. According to Martin, [...] "a lot of beautiful young women read for Shae. [...] But there's another dimension to Shae as well. She's not as practiced and hardened at this as a more seasoned pro. There's still a girl next door quality to her, a sense of vulnerability, playfulness, and, yes, innocence. [...] All of our Shaes were hot as hell. But only a handful of them captured that other quality, maybe three out of twenty, and Sibel was the standout. [...] Watching those auditions, any red-blooded male would want to take <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> Shae candidates to bed. But Sibel made you fall in love with her as well." ...|$|E

This indicates that (on average) pupils in the Academy chain were doing less well than other pupils in comparable non AET schools and so claims to be making 'real progress towards every academy being outstanding' are extremely implausible. In 2016 The DfE published comparative data looking at how the different Multi Academy Trusts were performing. AET was identified as being amongst the lowest performing with outcomes for secondary pupils that were 'significantly below average' ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{a letter}} to ABCFM {{corresponding}} secretary Dr. Judson Smith of 13 November 1900 (received by Smith on 7 January 1901), Ament says: I have been in Cho Chou. This time I proposed to settle affairs {{without the aid of}} soldiers or legations. It was a complete success. <b>Every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> dispossessed church-members has been reinstated and a money compensation made for his losses. This has been done by appealing to the sense of justice among the villages where our people lived and where they are respected by all decent people. The villagers were extremely grateful because I brought no foreign soldiers and were glad to settle on the terms proposed. After our conditions were known many villagers came of their own accord and brought their money with them. Apparently, the actions of Russian, French and German soldiers, [...] "who looted and killed on every hand, often taking delight in shooting every person visible... determined Dr. Ament not to go again with soldiers in his efforts to secure the replacing of the Christian in their homes, or to enforce the reasonable demands for indemnity for the great losses sustained by the church-members." [...] Ament wrote in a letter on 27 September 1900, about a month after the occupation of the Mongol Fu (palace): [...] "I am selling off the bric-a-brac, silks, furs found in the Fu {{for the benefit of the}} Christians." ...|$|E

60|$|Next {{followed}} in Europe the great Christian faith, which was essentially {{the religion of}} Comfort. Its great doctrine is the remission of sins; for which cause it happens, too often, in certain phases of Christianity, that sin and sickness themselves are partly glorified, as if, the more {{you had to be}} healed of, the more divine was the healing. The practical result of this doctrine, in art, is a continual contemplation of sin and disease, and of imaginary states of purification from them; thus we have an architecture conceived in a mingled sentiment of melancholy and aspiration, partly severe, partly luxuriant, which will bend itself to <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> needs, and <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> fancies, and be strong or weak with us, as we are strong or weak ourselves. It is, of all architecture, the basest, when base people build it--of all, the noblest, when built by the noble.|$|E

60|$|You may be {{sure that}} we had matter not only for gratulation but for {{conversation}} that night at supper; for, after discussing our recent adventure in all its phases, nearly <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> party had numerous similar incidents to tell of--either as having occurred to himself, or to his friends. But the pleasure of that night's intercourse and repose was materially diminished by a pest, with which for some time previously we had not been much afflicted.|$|E
60|$|Thus, {{throughout}} {{the organization of}} the Oligarchy, our own organization, weblike and spidery, was insinuating itself. And so I was kept in touch with all that was happening in the world without.

Those guys cannot appear in the movies. And you know, it wouldn't bother me so much, the movies that Hollywood makes never bother me so much as the movies they don't make. If there were eight films attacking our troops, I would still despise them for making them during war time. But if there were eight films supporting our troops, I know that those films would win out with the audience and I know their arguments would be better and I know the depiction of life would be more realistic.|$|R

60|$|But I {{return to}} the Devil's {{managing}} our wicked Part, for this he does with most exquisite Subtilty; and this is <b>one</b> Part <b>of</b> it, (viz.) he thrusts our Vices into our Virtues, by which he mixes the Clean and the Unclean, and thus by the Corruption <b>of</b> the <b>one,</b> poisons and debauches the other, so that the Slave he governs cannot account for his own common Actions, and is fain to be oblig'd to his Maker to accept of the Heart without the Hands and Feet; to take, as we vulgarly express it, the Will for the Deed, and if Heaven was not so good to come into that half in half Service, I don't see but the Devil would carry away all his Servants: Here indeed I should enter into a long Detail of involuntary Wickedness, which in short, is neither {{more or less than}} the Devil in every Body, ay, in <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> you, (<b>our</b> Governors excepted) take it as you please.|$|R
60|$|Never did I see goods {{transferred}} in quicker time.

Here also I was accommodated, with about half of our people, the rest taking their seats in the smaller boat under the charge of Stephen.|$|E
60|$|This time {{my friend}} Loll Mahommed, who had received, as the reader may remember, such a bastinadoing for my sake, headed the attack. The poor wretch could not walk, {{but he was}} carried in an open palanquin, and came on waving his sword, and cursing horribly in his Hindustan jargon. Behind him came troops of matchlock-men, who picked off <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> men who showed their noses above the ramparts: and a great host of blackamoors with scaling-ladders, bundles to fill the ditch, fascines, gabions, culverins, demilunes, counterscarps, {{and all the other}} {{appurtenances}} of offensive war.|$|E
60|$|To their slaves {{they did}} not give either musket or fusee; but they had each a halberd, or a long staff, like a quarter-staff, with a great spike of iron {{fastened}} into each end of it, and by his side a hatchet; also <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> men had a hatchet. Two of the women could not be prevailed upon but they would come into the fight, and they had bows and arrows, which the Spaniards had taken from the savages when the first action happened, which I have spoken of, where the Indians fought with one another; and the women had hatchets too.|$|E

It was not as if she was sinking either. She was only holed foreward and aft, with a bad hit in the engine-room, and her steering-gear knocked out. In this posture she cheered the passing ships, and set about repairing her hurts with good heart and a smiling countenance. She managed to get under some sort of way at midnight, and next day was taken in tow by a friend. She says officially, [...] "his assistance was invaluable, as I had no oil left and met heavy weather." ...|$|R
60|$|The truth is, my friends, {{that these}} souls of ours {{instead of being}} pure and strong, are the very opposite; and the article speaks plain truth when it says, that we are <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> us <b>of</b> <b>our</b> own nature {{inclined}} to evil. That may seem a hard saying; but {{if we look at}} our own thoughts we shall find it true. Are we NOT inclined to take, at first, the worst view of everybody and of everything? Are we NOT inclined to suspect harm of this person and of that? Are we NOT inclined too often to be mean and cowardly? to be hard and covetous? to be coarse and vulgar? to be silly and frivolous? Do we not need to cool down, to think a second time, and a third time likewise; to remember our duty, to remember Christ's example, before we can take a just and kind and charitable view? Do we not want all the help which we can get from every quarter, to keep ourselves high-minded and refined; to keep ourselves from bad thoughts, mean thoughts, silly thoughts, violent thoughts, cruel and hard thoughts? If we have not found out that, we must have looked a very little way into ourselves, and know little more about ourselves than a dumb animal does of itself.|$|R
5000|$|The reverence {{held for}} Cher {{by members of}} the gay {{community}} has been attributed to her accomplishments in her career, her sense of style and her longevity. Alec Mapa of The Advocate elaborates: [...] "While the rest of us were sleeping, Cher's been out there for the last four decades living out <b>every</b> single <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> childhood fantasies... Cher embodies an unapologetic freedom and fearlessness that some of us can only aspire to." [...] Cher has often been imitated by drag queens. Thomas Rogers of Salon magazine commented that [...] "drag queens imitate women like Judy Garland, Dolly Parton and Cher because they overcame insult and hardship on their path to success, and because their narratives mirror the pain that many gay men suffer on {{their way out of the}} closet." [...] Cher's performance as a lesbian in the film Silkwood as well as her transition to dance music and social activism in recent years has further contributed to her becoming a gay icon.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Billings was, in fact, a {{frequent}} visitor at the Ambassador's house; to whose presence he, by a general order, was always admitted. As for the connection between Mrs. Catherine and her former admirer, the Abbe's history of it is perfectly correct; nor can it be said that this wretched woman, whose tale now begins to wear a darker hue, was, in anything but SOUL, faithless to her husband.

60|$|First as to Health. One of {{the first}} duties of a citizen is to keep himself in mental and bodily health {{in order to be}} fit {{for the rest of his}} duties. Now the real Bible, our model, is {{extremely}} explicit upon a number of points, upon what constitutes cleanness or uncleanness, upon ablutions, upon what a man or woman may eat and what may not be eaten, upon a number of such points. It was for its times and circumstances a directory of healthy practice.

60|$|<b>Of</b> <b>our</b> voyage {{there is}} little to tell except of its sad end. At the Canary Isles we stayed a month, and then sailed away for Hispaniola, meeting with fine weather but light winds. When, as our captain reckoned, we were within a week's sail of the port of San Domingo for which we were bound, the weather changed, and {{presently}} gathered to a furious tempest from the north that grew more terrible every hour. For three days and nights our cumbrous vessel groaned and laboured beneath the stress of the gale, that drove us on rapidly we knew not whither, till at length it became clear that, unless the weather moderated, we must founder. Our ship leaked at <b>every</b> seam, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> masts was carried away, and another broken in two, at a height of twenty feet from the deck. But all these misfortunes were small compared to what was to come, for on the fourth morning a great wave swept off our rudder, and we drifted helpless before the waves. An hour later a green sea came aboard of us, washing away the captain, so that we filled and settled down to founder.|$|R
