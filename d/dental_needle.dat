40|$|It is {{estimated}} that 60, 000 cartridges of local anaesthetic are used weekly in the USA for dental anaesthesia by infiltration or block injections. 1 The complication of needle breakage after an inferior alveolar nerve block is relatively rare in dental practice. 2 One of the first ever case series on <b>dental</b> <b>needle</b> breakage was published in 1928 by Blum, who reported 65 broken needles over a tenyear period. 3 The routine use of single-use, disposable stainless steel needles made from stronger alloys has decreased this complication. 4 Today, needle breakage during local anaesthesia {{may be attributed to}} a faulty needle, an incorrect anaesthetic injection technique or sudden movement by the patient in a direction opposite to the needle. 5 It is important to caution the patient against sudden movement during administration of the injection. The needle should not be redirected against tissue resistance while it is embedded in tissue, as this can cause breakage to occur. ...|$|E

40|$|QUINTESSENCE INTERNATIONAL One of {{the major}} {{problems}} in dental prac-tice is {{the fear of the}} dental injection, which most patients exhibit during treatment. Patients are often more distressed by the sight of a needle during administration of local anesthetic than by the ensuing treat-ment. Despite improvements in both the effectiveness of anesthetic solutions and the quality of <b>dental</b> <b>needles,</b> the method of administration has largely remained unchanged. A needle connected to a syringe remains a necessity, and the realization that it will penetrate the oral mucosa is chilling for most patients. 1 To reduce and eliminate pain and thus alleviate the fear of the injection, cli-nicians have resorted to applying anesthetic topically beforehand to the mucosal area proximal to the site at which the syringe injec-tion is to be administered. 2 Needle-less local anesthesia: Clinical evaluation of the effectiveness of the jet anesthesia Injex in local anesthesia in dentistr...|$|R

The study was a survey carried out on the dentists stationed in Khartoum State. Questionnaires about the infection control measures were distributed to the 150 randomly selected dentists in their clinics. The data was analyzed with computer using (SPSS). The results showed that 52 % vaccinated against HBV, 73 % used dry heat for instrument sterilization while 22 % used autoclave. For the use of PPE, results showed 92 % wore gloves before treating patients, 50 % used facemasks, 15 % used protective eyewear and about 61 % wore coats. Results also indicated that 24 % sterilized handpieces, 48 % disinfected impressions and non-disposable trays, 77 % possessed more than one piece of each hand instrument. It was found that 100 % used disposable <b>dental</b> <b>needles</b> and 96 % used disposable anaesthetic corpules, 47 % used closed containers for sharps disposal, more than 67 % disposed clinic waste with the household.

Methods: A descriptive type of cross sectional study survey was conducted at Maxillofacial Surgery Department, Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences, Jamshoro from April 2012 to April 2013. Sample size comprising of Six hundred thirteen individuals including maxillofacial surgeons, general dentists, house officers and undergraduate students working at Liaquat University hospital. A specifically designed questionnaire was administered to each individual focusing on number, nature, and predisposing factors for Needle stick injury. Collected data was analysed by using SPSS 17. Results: Response rate was 99. 02 % (n= 607). Females were 52. 38 % (n= 318). Since entering their clinical year, 59. 80 % (363 / 607) experienced a total of 776 Needle stick injuries.

One surgical session (SS) was performed under local anesthesia aided by nitrous oxide-oxygen inhalation sedation, and the other SS was performed on the contralateral quadrant under LA. For each session, blood samples to measure and evaluate serum cortisol levels were obtained, and vital parameters including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and arterial blood oxygen saturation were monitored before, during, and after periodontal surgical procedures. Statistical Analysis Used: Paired t-test and repeated measure ANOVA. Results: The findings of the present study revealed a statistically significant decrease in serum cortisol levels, blood pressure and pulse rate and a statistically significant increase in respiratory rate and arterial blood oxygen saturation during periodontal surgical procedures under nitrous oxide inhalation sedation.

A 45 -year-old generally healthy male patient reported to the Department of Conservative Dentistry with Endodontics of the Medical University of Silesia, because of orbital and buccal pain {{on the right side of}} his face and headaches in the preceding 6 months. Those symptoms were associated with the end of endodontic treatment of teeth 14 and 16. Periapical X-rays, including of teeth 14 and 16, showed the presence of root canal filling with extrusion of endodontic obturation material beyond the apices of tooth 14. In the case of tooth 16, a completely filled palatal canal and incompletely filled buccal canals were found. There was also an irregular dimness at the upper edge of the X-ray image. Panoramic radiography and computed tomography demonstrated a foreign body in the right sinus. Sinus exploration was performed via a surgical procedure conducted using topical anesthesia. The root apices of tooth 14 were resected, and foreign substance was removed. The practitioner did not correctly recognize a complication that occurred during endodontic treatment, which resulted in extrusion of endodontic material beyond the root apices of tooth 14. This case emphasizes the potential impact that an involved maxillary sinus may have on endodontic therapy. Detailed diagnostic identification based on the medical interview, physical and histopathological examinations, and diagnostic imaging allowed rapid surgical intervention and prevented local and general complications. It is important to realize that the range of the periapical X-ray projection is not always sufficient...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis C is a {{viral disease}} {{transmitted}} principally by blood, which affects {{millions of people}} worldwide. A significant proportion of those affected develop severe liver disease as a result. Only a fraction of patients are responsive to interferon treatment, highlighting the need for further research into genetic factors involved in response to therapy in order to optimize treatment. The only current approach for end-stage disease is liver transplant, which ironically does not cure the condition, and thus poses a clinical dilemma in the face of liver-donor shortage. One hundred and fifty million people are infected by hepatitis C virus (HCV) worldwide, and chronic hepatitis C is now the leading indication for liver transplantation in the US [1]. Transmitted principally by blood, HCV is passed by transfusion of inadequately screened blood and blood products, and by intravenous drug use; sexual and vertical transmission also occur, but at substantially lower rates than in other blood-borne viral infections. Unsterile <b>dental</b> equipment, accidental <b>needle</b> punctures in medical facilities, and tattooing are also linked to transmission. Following acquisition of infection, 70 to 85 % of patients will develop persistent viremia, usually for the duration of their lives. Not all of these will develop liver failure, however- infection is often indolent for long periods. Nonetheless, two decades after infection about 20 % of HCV-infected subjects will have developed endstage liver disease [2]. Hepatitis C is now a more common cause of cirrhosis than alcoholism. Though chronic hepatitis is the major result of HCV infection, there are other manifestations of the disease that stem from chronic inflammation and associated immune cell stimulation with cytokine release. These include arthritis, antibody-mediated thrombocytopenia, itching, porphyria cutanea tarda, dermatitis, glomerulonephritis and cryoglobulinemia...|$|R
