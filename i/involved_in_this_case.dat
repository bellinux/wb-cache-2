In response to hearing an erroneous report of the murder of civil rights activist James Meredith, Sidney Street burned a 48-star U.S. flag. Street {{was arrested and charged with}} a New York state law making it a crime [...] "publicly [...] mutilate, deface, defile, or defy, trample upon, or cast contempt upon either by words or act [...]" [...] In a 5–4 decision, the Court, relying on Stromberg v. California (1931), found that because the provision of the New York law criminalizing [...] "words" [...] against the flag was unconstitutional, and the trial did not sufficiently demonstrate that he was convicted solely under the provisions not yet deemed unconstitutional, the conviction was unconstitutional. The Court, however, [...] "resist the pulls to decide the constitutional issues <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> on a broader basis" [...] and left the constitutionality of flag-burning unaddressed.|$|E

40|$|International audiencePreliminary words One {{important}} feature of Poincaré's conventionalism of geometry {{is linked to the}} relation between the abstract notion of space geometry and the representations of the free mobility of our bodies. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> sense «the group of rigid motions» identified by Helmholtz and Lie as the foundation of geometries of constant curvature is, according to Poincaré, an idealization of the primitive experience that acquaints us with the properties of space in the first place. 2 Furthermore, since Poincaré thinks that the only adequate candidates for physical geometry – the geometries of constant curvature – are equivalent from a mathematical point of view (they are homeomorphic), we can choose any one of these. Actually, according to Poincaré, the idealization <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> passing from our own local motions to the group of motions makes use of temporal intuition: our notion of the large-space structure of space assumes that our displacements are infinitely iterables and this assumes temporal intuition. 3 Thus, it looks as Poincaré's notion of convention assumes some kind of idealization process.
