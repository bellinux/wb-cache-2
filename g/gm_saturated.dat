40|$|There are clones of myeloid leukemic cells {{which are}} {{different}} from normal myeloid cells in that they have become independent of hematopoietic growth factor for cell viability and growth. The ability of these clones to bind three types of hematopoietic growth factors (MGI- 1 GM = GM-CSF, IL- 3 = multi-CSF and MGI- 1 M = M-CSF = CSF- 1) was measured using the method of quantitative absorption at 1 degree C and low pH elution of cell-bound biological activity. Results of binding to normal myeloid and lymphoid cells {{were similar to those}} obtained by radioreceptor assays. The results indicate that the number of receptors on different clones of these leukemic cells varied from 0 to 1, 300 per cell. The receptors have a high binding affinity. Receptors for different growth factors can be independently expressed in different clones. There was no relationship between expression of receptors for these growth factors and the phenotype of the leukemic cells regarding their ability to be induced to differentiate. The number of receptors on the leukemic cells was lower than on normal mature macrophages. Myeloid leukemic cells induced to differentiate by normal myeloid cell differentiation factor MGI- 2 (= DF), or by low doses of actinomycin D or cytosine arabinoside, showed an up-regulation of the number of MGI- 1 GM and IL- 3 receptors. Induction of differentiation of leukemic cells by MGI- 2 also induced production and secretion of the growth factor MGI- 1 GM, and this induced MGI- 1 <b>GM</b> <b>saturated</b> the up-regulated MGI- 1 GM receptors. It is suggested that up-regulation of these receptors during differentiation is required for the functioning of differentiated cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{permeability}} {{properties of}} planar lipid bilayers made from egg lecithin, n-decane and a long-chain secondary amine (n-lauryl [trialkylmethyl]amine) are described. Membranes containing the secondary amine show halide selectivity and high conductance at pH less than 6, as estimated by measurements of zero-current potentials generated by NaBr activity gradients. In {{the absence of}} halide ions, the membranes show H+ selectivity, although the total membrane conductance is relatively low. In 0. 1 M NaBr both the membrane conductance (Gm) and the Br- self-exchange flux (JBr) are proportional to H+ concentration over the pH range of 7 to 4, and both JBr and <b>Gm</b> <b>saturate</b> at pH less than 4. However, JBr is always more than 100 times the flux predicted from Gm and the transference number for Br-. Thus, greater than 99 % of the observed (tracer) flux is electrically silent {{and is not a}} Br 2 or HBrO flux because the reducing agent, S 2 O 3 =, has no effect on JBr. At pH 7, JBr is proportional to Br- concentration over the range of 1 - 340 mM, with no sign of saturation kinetics. Both urea and sulfate tracer permeabilities are low and are unaffected by pH. The results can be explained by a model in which the secondary amine behaves as a monovalent, titratable carrier which exists in three chemical forms (C, CH+, and CHBr). Br- crosses the membrane primarily as the neurtal complex (CHBr). The positively charged carrier (CH+) crosses the membrane slowly compared to CHBr, but CH+ is the principal charge carrier in the membrane. At neurtal pH greater than 99 % of the amine is in the nonfunctional form (C), which can be converted to CH+ or CHBr by increasing the H+ or Br- concentrations. The permeability properties of these lipid bilayers resemble in many respects the permeability properties of red cell membranes...|$|R
