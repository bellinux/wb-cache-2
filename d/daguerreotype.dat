5|$|In August 1839, {{the first}} British {{commercial}} production of <b>daguerreotype</b> photographs {{were carried out}} in a property on Regent Street, shortly after the process had been publicly documented.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from some}} minor medical applications, the first {{commercial}} use was the <b>daguerreotype.</b> In 1840, bromine was discovered to have some advantages over the previously used iodine vapor to create the light sensitive silver halide layer in daguerreotypy.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} {{telescopic}} observation {{of a total}} solar eclipse was made in France in 1706. Nine years later, English astronomer Edmund Halley accurately predicted and observed the solar eclipse of May 3, 1715. By the mid-19th century, scientific understanding of the Sun was improving through observations of the Sun's corona during solar eclipses. The corona was identified {{as part of the}} Sun's atmosphere in 1842, and the first photograph (or <b>daguerreotype)</b> of a total eclipse was taken of the solar eclipse of July 28, 1851. Spectroscope observations were made of the solar eclipse of August 18, 1868, which helped to determine the chemical composition of the Sun.|$|E

50|$|Six nations: the United States, England, France, Italy, Germany and Austria {{exhibited}} 700 daguerrotypes in {{a special}} section of the Great Exhibition devoted to <b>Daguerreotypes</b> and Calotypes. It is considered the first international photography competition. Mayall exhibited 72 <b>daguerreotypes</b> in the photographic section and he received an Honourable Mention in the jury's official report on the photographic exhibits. Three of the five medals awarded to <b>daguerreotypes</b> went to the Americans Mathew Brady, Martin M. Lawrence and John Adams Whipple.|$|R
50|$|Until 1858 Britt {{could take}} only <b>daguerreotypes</b> or ambrotypes, {{processes}} that provided only the photo, no negatives or extra prints. About 200 of his <b>daguerreotypes</b> survive. Britt's first wet plate negative was taken of a trapper {{who agreed to}} sit for Britt's experiment.|$|R
5|$|The oldest {{photograph}} on record in Denmark is credited to Peter Faber (1810–1877), a songwriter and {{a pioneer in}} telegraphy. His <b>daguerreotype</b> of Ulfeldts Plads is in the Copenhagen City Museum. The image of the square is in fact reversed left to right, as was normal for daguerreotypes unless a mirror was used together with the camera. Careful analysis of the photograph suggests that it dates back to July 1840. The exposure time of about 15 minutes in sunlight explains why the only figure to be seen is a man sleeping {{at the foot of}} the Pillar of Shame towards the left of the picture.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{is used in}} roofing, currency, and for {{photographic}} technology {{known as}} the <b>daguerreotype.</b> Copper was used in Renaissance sculpture, and was used to construct the Statue of Liberty; copper continues {{to be used in}} construction of various types. Copper plating and copper sheathing were widely used to protect the under-water hulls of ships, a technique pioneered by the British Admiralty in the 18th century. The Norddeutsche Affinerie in Hamburg was the first modern electroplating plant, starting its production in 1876. The German scientist Gottfried Osann invented powder metallurgy in 1830 while determining the metal's atomic mass; around then it was discovered that the amount and type of alloying element (e.g., tin) to copper would affect bell tones. Flash smelting was developed by Outokumpu in Finland and first applied at Harjavalta in 1949; the energy-efficient process accounts for 50% of the world's primary copper production.|$|E

25|$|Driven by {{his desire}} for travel and the up-and-coming art of {{photography}} (<b>daguerréotype),</b> he visited Italy and Germany. Once in England, he married Anna Park, possibly granddaughter of the explorer Mungo Park (1771–1806). In 1856, the couple settled down in the Isle of Jersey.|$|E
25|$|In about 1840, the English {{industrial}} chemist Hugh Lee Pattinson travelled to Canada, {{stopping at}} the Niagara Falls {{long enough to make}} the earliest known photograph of the falls, a <b>daguerreotype</b> in the collection of Newcastle University. It was once believed that the small figure standing silhouetted with a top hat was added by an engraver working from imagination as well as the <b>daguerreotype</b> as his source, but the figure is clearly present in the photograph. Because of the very long exposure required, of ten minutes or more, the figure is assumed by Canada's Niagara Parks agency to be Pattinson himself. The image is left-right inverted, and taken from the Canadian side. Pattinson made other photographs of the Horseshoe Falls as well as of Rome and Paris. These were then transferred to engravings to illustrate Noël Marie Paymal Lerebours' Excursions Daguerriennes (Paris, 1841–1864).|$|E

25|$|Ueno Hikoma's family {{background}} perhaps provided an early impetus for his eventual career. A number {{of family members}} had been portrait painters. Furthermore, {{he was the son}} of Ueno Toshinojō (also known as Ueno Shunnojō) (17901851), a merchant in the employ of the Shimazu clan who in 1848 imported possibly the first camera in the country, a <b>daguerreotype</b> camera for the Shimazu daimyō, Nariakira.|$|E
25|$|Tourism {{has been}} a factor at Chichen Itza {{for more than a}} century. John Lloyd Stephens, who popularized the Maya Yucatán in the public's {{imagination}} with his book Incidents of Travel in Yucatan, inspired many to make a pilgrimage to Chichén Itzá. Even before the book was published, Benjamin Norman and Baron Emanuel von Friedrichsthal traveled to Chichen after meeting Stephens, and both published the results of what they found. Friedrichsthal was the first to photograph Chichen Itza, using the recently invented <b>daguerreotype.</b>|$|E
25|$|Two very {{important}} daguerreotypes (an early photographic process) were purchased in the 1990s. The first was of African American abolitionist and former slave Frederick Douglass, acquired in 1990. It {{is one of}} only four daguerreotypes of Douglass known to exist. That year, the number of images in the museum's photography collection reached 8,500 objects. Six years later, the NPG obtained for $115,000 the earliest known <b>daguerreotype</b> of abolitionist John Brown, whose 1859 raid on Harpers Ferry helped sparked the Civil War. The portrait was created by African American photographer Augustus Washington.|$|E

25|$|The Library holds a {{collection}} of more than 800,000 photographs, including the earliest-known photograph in Wales. The <b>daguerreotype</b> of Margam Castle, made by Reverend Calvert Richard Jones, dates from 1841. Many other examples of photography from the 1840s and 1850s, such as the early Swansea photography of the Dillwyn Llewelyn family, are kept in the National Collection of Welsh Photographs. This collection also contains mounted portraits by high-street photographers, topographic views and portraits by John Thomas and scenic postcard photography by Francis Frith that are connected to Wales.|$|E
25|$|Gibbs {{attended}} Kimball Union Academy at Meriden, New Hampshire, {{and graduated}} in 1848. At the time, the academy {{was under the}} guidance of abolitionist principal, Cyrus Smith Richards, who had earlier allowed Augustus Washington (who would also attend Dartmouth) to study at the academy. Washington is best known for a famous <b>daguerreotype</b> of John Brown. At KUA, Gibbs became acquainted with Charles Barrett, a native of Grafton, Vermont, who would become one of his closest friends. The two went on to Dartmouth College, and later, Barrett returned to his native Vermont and served in politics.|$|E
25|$|In 1851, {{the year}} of Daguerre's death, Frederick Scott Archer publicised the wet {{collodion}} process, which made it practical to use glass instead of paper as the support for making the camera negative. The lack of detail often criticised in prints made from calotype negatives was overcome, and sharp images, comparable in degree of detail to daguerreotypes, could at last be provided by convenient paper prints. The collodion process soon replaced the calotype in commercial use, {{and by the end}} of the decade the <b>daguerreotype</b> was virtually extinct as well.|$|E

25|$|Shortly after Louis Daguerre's {{invention}} of the <b>daguerreotype</b> was announced in early January 1839, without details, Talbot asserted priority of invention based on experiments he had begun in early 1834. At {{a meeting of the}} Royal Institution on 25 January 1839, Talbot exhibited several paper photographs he had made in 1835. Within a fortnight, he communicated the general nature of his process to the Royal Society, followed by more complete details a few weeks later. Daguerre did not publicly reveal any useful details until mid-August, although by the spring it had become clear that his process and Talbot's were very different.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, a British inventor, William Fox Talbot, {{had succeeded}} in making crude but {{reasonably}} light-fast silver images on paper as early as 1834 but had kept his work secret. After reading about Daguerre's invention in January 1839, Talbot published his hitherto secret method and set about improving on it. At first, like other pre-daguerreotype processes, Talbot's paper-based photography typically required hours-long exposures in the camera, but in 1840 he created the calotype process, which used the chemical development of a latent image to greatly reduce the exposure needed and compete with the <b>daguerreotype.</b> In both its original and calotype forms, Talbot's process, unlike Daguerre's, created a translucent negative {{which could be used}} to print multiple positive copies; this is the basis of most modern chemical photography up to the present day, as Daguerreotypes could only be replicated by rephotographing them with a camera. Talbot's famous tiny paper negative of the Oriel window in Lacock Abbey, {{one of a number of}} camera photographs he made in the summer of 1835, may be the oldest camera negative in existence.|$|E
500|$|Fizeau–Foucault {{apparatus}} {{is a term}} {{sometimes used}} to refer to two types of instrument historically used to measure the speed of light. The conflation of the two instrument types arises in part because Hippolyte Fizeau and Léon Foucault had originally been friends and collaborators. They worked together on such projects as using the <b>Daguerreotype</b> process to take [...] between 1843 and 1845 and characterizing [...] in 1847.|$|E
50|$|A {{native of}} Naestved in {{southern}} Sealand, he learnt {{the art of}} <b>daguerreotyping</b> from his father C.C. Hansen who had begun to produce <b>daguerreotypes</b> in 1849. After studying photography in Germany, in 1854 he helped his father set up a studio near Kongens Nytorv in the centre of Copenhagen. The new equipment he had brought back from Germany was of considerable assistance.|$|R
