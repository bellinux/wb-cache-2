5|$|Wighard was a Saxon priest {{during the}} late 7th century, and a native of Kent. He served in the {{household}} of Archbishop Deusdedit of Canterbury, and was also a priest at Canterbury. The 8th-century writer Bede says that Wighard was selected to be Archbishop of Canterbury, {{and that he was}} sent to Rome to visit Pope Vitalian for confirmation and to receive his pallium. <b>How</b> <b>exactly</b> he was selected, and when that occurred, is open to debate, as Bede himself had two different stories. The first one, related in his Historia Abbatum, stated that Wighard was selected by King Ecgberht of Kent. Fifteen years after Bede's completion of the Historia Abbatum, Bede wrote the Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, which states that Wighard was selected by Oswiu of Northumbria and Ecgberht with the consent of all the clergy and people. Some modern historians have followed Bede's second account, but others feel that only Ecgberht selected Wighard.|$|E
5|$|The ears {{of river}} {{dolphins}} have specific adaptations to their aquatic environment. In humans, {{the middle ear}} works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In river dolphins, and other cetaceans, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, river dolphins receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allows for greater directional hearing underwater. Dolphins send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. This allows river dolphins to produce biosonar for orientation. They are so dependent on echolocation that they can survive {{even if they are}} blind. Beyond locating an object, echolocation also provides the animal with an idea on the object's shape and size, though <b>how</b> <b>exactly</b> this works is not yet understood. The small hairs on the rostrum of the Amazon river dolphin are believed to function as a tactile sense, possibly to compensate for their poor eyesight.|$|E

25|$|It is {{believed}} that a receptor molecule exists in a conformational equilibrium between active and inactive biophysical states. The binding of ligands to the receptor may shift the equilibrium toward the active receptor states. Three types of ligands exist: Agonists are ligands that shift the equilibrium in favour of active states; inverse agonists are ligands that shift the equilibrium in favour of inactive states; and neutral antagonists are ligands that do not affect the equilibrium. It is not yet known <b>how</b> <b>exactly</b> the active and inactive states differ from each other.|$|E

Medieval Scotland was a patriarchal society, but <b>how</b> <b>exactly</b> patriarchy worked in practice is difficult to discern. A large proportion of the women for whom biographical details survive were members of the royal houses of Scotland. Some of these became important figures. There was only one reigning Scottish Queen in this period, the uncrowned and short-lived Margaret, Maid of Norway (r. 1286–90).|$|E
25|$|According to {{more recent}} theories, Cyphophthalmi, the most basal suborder, are a sister group {{to all other}} harvestmen, which are {{according}} to this system called Phalangida.

In 2002, Giribet et al. {{came to the conclusion that}} Dyspnoi and Laniatores are sister groups, and called them Dyspnolaniatores, which are sister to Eupnoi. This is in contrast to the classical hypothesis that Dyspnoi and Eupnoi form a clade called Palpatores. Dyspnolaniatores was also recovered in a 2011 study.|$|E
