50|$|A punch (or moving blade) {{is used to}} push a {{workpiece}} against the die (or fixed blade), which is fixed. Usually the clearance {{between the two is}} 5 to 40% of the thickness of the material, but dependent on the material. Clearance is defined as the separation between the blades, measured {{at the point where the}} cutting action takes place and perpendicular to the direction of blade movement. It affects the finish of the cut (burr) and the machine's power consumption. This causes the material to experience highly localized shear stresses between the punch and die. The material will then fail when the punch has moved 15 to 60% the thickness of the material, because the shear stresses are greater than the shear strength of the material and the remainder of the material is torn. Two distinct sections can be seen on a sheared workpiece, the first part being plastic deformation and the second being fractured. Because of normal inhomogeneities in materials and inconsistencies in clearance between the punch and die, the shearing action does not occur in a uniform manner. The fracture will begin at the weakest point and progress to the next weakest point until the entire workpiece has been sheared; this is what causes the rough edge. The rough edge can be reduced if the workpiece is clamped from the top with a <b>die</b> <b>cushion.</b> Above a certain pressure the fracture zone can be completely eliminated. However, the sheared edge of the workpiece will usually experience workhardening and cracking. If the workpiece has too much clearance, then it may experience roll-over or heavy burring.|$|E
40|$|DE 19953860 A UPAB: 20010704 NOVELTY - The {{press has}} a <b>die</b> <b>cushion</b> {{table and a}} press ram with upper tool. A non-divided <b>die</b> <b>cushion</b> plate (8) engages with outer cushion {{cylinders}} (9), which are located in corner areas of the plate. At least one inner cushion cylinder (10) is located under the <b>die</b> <b>cushion</b> plate. Inner and outer cylinders are pressure-charged by a control device, dependent upon travel and/or pressure signals of the tool unit. USE - Deep-drawing of metal plate components. ADVANTAGE - Can use large and small tools without extra load on cushion guide, improved component holding function...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the effect of the Die cushioning in the U-bending process. Different Die cushioning values are used to study their effect on distributions of stresses and strains in work piece. Two examples were analyzed one without <b>Die</b> <b>cushion</b> and another with <b>Die</b> <b>cushion</b> with Four values (10 %, 20 %, 30 % and 40 % of bending load) were applied by Die cushioning on bottom of the workpiece. 3 D model of U-bending was used and analyzed by COSMOS. Low carbon steel (IS 2062 GrB) was chosen to carry out the simulation. The results show that the <b>Die</b> <b>cushion</b> force has an effect on the center displacement and distribution of strains and stresses in final product...|$|E
50|$|Multi-jackbolt {{tensioners}} {{can be used}} on many {{press column}} applications, especially where large thread sizes are required. Thrust collars ease assembly and disassembly on large press columns, while greatly reducing critical problems such as thread galling and seizing. Multi-jackbolt tensioners are also used on tie-rods, bearing blocks, high-pressure piping, <b>die</b> <b>cushions,</b> cylinder ram bolting, and anchor bolts.|$|R
50|$|The Marform process, for example, {{operates}} {{using the}} principle of rubber pad forming techniques. Deep-recessed parts with either vertical or sloped walls can be formed. In this type of forming, the die rig employs a rubber pad as one tool half and a solid tool half, similar to the die in a conventional die set, to form a component into its final shape. Dies are made of cast light alloys and the rubber pad is 1.5-2 times thicker than the component to be formed. For Marforming, single-action presses are equipped with <b>die</b> <b>cushions</b> and blank holders. The blank is held against the rubber pad by a blank holder, through which a punch is acting as in conventional deep drawing. It is a double-acting apparatus: at first the ram slides down, then the blank holder moves: this feature allows it to perform deep drawings (30-40% transverse dimension) with no wrinkles.|$|R
50|$|The {{bolster plate}} {{is mounted on}} top of the press bed and is a large block of metal upon which the bottom portion of a die is clamped; the bolster plate is stationary. Large presses (like the ones used in the {{automotive}} industry) may be equipped <b>die</b> <b>cushions</b> integrated in the bolster plate to apply blank holder or counter draw forces. This is necessary when a single acting press is used for deep drawing. The ram / slide is the moving or reciprocating member that the upper die is mounted to. Ram or Slide guidance is a critical element to assure long die life between die maintenance. Different types of slide guides are available, 4 point V-Gibs or 6 point square gibs on smaller presses and 8 point full length slide guides on larger straight side frame presses. With the dies and material be fed into the die between the bolster and slide, good press designs must account for plastic deformation, other wise known as defection when frame design and loads are considered.|$|R
40|$|A draw pin was {{replaced}} ad hoc {{with a highly}} durable piezoactuator integrated in a force control cycle. The force progression during the sheet draw-in could be accurately adjusted according to a predetermined master curve. The master curve was taken up in the unregulated process and represents the quality criteria of a formed useable part. The real-time MATLAB Simulink XPC-Target simulation tool was used to develop an adjustment strategy that connects the specific signals of the press control (such as the tappet path, the <b>die</b> <b>cushion</b> position and the <b>die</b> <b>cushion</b> force) with the reference force (i. e., the master curve) and the actual force of the piezoactuator...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{study focused}} on {{utilizing}} a servo <b>die</b> <b>cushion</b> (in conjunction with a servo press) as a “back-pressure load generator,” to determine its effect on shape accuracy of the formed part and total forming load in forward extrusion during cold forging. The effect of back-pressure load application was confirmed in experiments, and the optimum setting pattern of back-pressure load was considered to minimize both shape accuracy of the formed part and back-pressure energy, which was representative of forming energy using a sequential approximate optimization. The precise back-pressure load control by the servo <b>die</b> <b>cushion</b> enabled the ideal load-pattern setting for optimization to be achieved...|$|E
40|$|In the "Merge" {{project a}} forming {{process for the}} in situ {{manufacture}} of metal/plastic composite structures will be developed. The process {{is a combination of}} deep drawing, injection moulding and media based forming in one die. The project is splited into two phases. In the first phase 2013 - 2014 the technical basis will be created and tested on a cup with a polymer injected plastic inner part. Aluminum, steel and hybrid laminates will be used as sheet materials and PA 6 as plastic component. In the second phase 2015 - 2017 the process should be transferred to a production orientated part. After {{the state of the art}} three technologies for the manufacturing of metal plastic composite parts are existing: the insert technology, the outsert technology and the metal plastic hybrid technology. In all technologies the metal or sheet parts where produced separately from the plastic parts. The injection moulding process is only used for forming the plastic parts and for joining the parts. The "Merge" process is divided into two steps. First operation is the deep drawing process to generate the preform of the metal part. Then the injection moulding process takes place. The plastic melt will be used for the injection moulding and also as an active media for metal forming. A real deep drawing process with blank holder and <b>die</b> <b>cushion</b> should be realized. So the process had to be installed on a deep drawing press together with an injection moulding bolt on unit...|$|E
40|$|Decay of {{peat moss}} {{cushions}} {{has been observed}} in the Scdici cinereae-Sphagnetum recurvi associa tion of the lake Bence-tó (northern part of the Great Hungarian Plain) since 8 September, 1994. During these two years 36 % of the investigated <b>cushions</b> <b>died.</b> The two Sphagnum species compo sing the cushions decay at the same ratio. The critical cushion size on this lake is 31 cm x 29 cm. Smaller cushions than this have hardly any chance to survive. According to our experiences the main reason of this decay is the insufficient water supply. Due to this the contiguous cushions {{become more and more}} divided each year and finally dry out completely. The closed shrub layer contributes to the decrease of vaporization of the peat moss layer and the soil surface. I f the foliage of Salix cinerea, which forms the shrub layer, is opened, peat moss cushions tend to lose more water, thus have less chance to survive.

6000|$|Why, {{that simple}} old Laxart sat {{up there and}} droned out the most tedious and empty tale one ever heard, and neither he nor Papa D'Arc ever gave a thought to the badness of the {{etiquette}} of it, or ever suspected that that foolish tale was anything but dignified and valuable history. There was not an atom of value in it; and whilst they thought it distressing and pathetic, {{it was in fact}} not pathetic at all, but actually ridiculous. At least it seemed so to me, and it seems so yet. Indeed, I know it was, because it made Joan laugh; and the more sorrowful it got the more it made her laugh; and the Paladin said that he could have laughed himself if she had not been there, and Noel Rainguesson said the same. It was about old Laxart going to a funeral there at Domremy two or three weeks back. He had spots all over his face and hands, and he got Joan to rub some healing ointment on them, and while she was doing it, and comforting him, and trying to say pitying things to him, he told her how it happened. And first he asked her if she remembered that black bull calf that she left behind when she came away, and she said indeed she did, and he was a dear, and she loved him so, and was he well?--and just drowned him in questions about that creature. And {{he said it was a}} young bull now, and very frisky; and he was to bear a principal hand at a funeral; and she said, [...] "The bull?" [...] and he said, [...] "No, myself"; but said the bull did take a hand, but not because of his being invited, for he wasn't; but anyway he was away over beyond the Fairy Tree, and fell asleep on the grass with his Sunday funeral clothes on, and a long black rag on his hat and hanging down his back; and when he woke he saw by the sun how late it was, and not a moment to lose; and jumped up terribly worried, and saw the young bull grazing there, and thought maybe he could ride part way on him and gain time; so he tied a rope around the bull's body to hold on by, and put a halter on him to steer with, and jumped on and started; but it was all new to the bull, and he was discontented with it, and scurried around and bellowed and reared and pranced, and Uncle Laxart was satisfied, and wanted to get off and go by the next bull or some other way that was quieter, but he didn't dare try; and it was getting very warm for him, too, and disturbing and wearisome, and not proper for Sunday; but by and by the bull lost all his temper, and went tearing down the slope with his tail in the air and blowing in the most awful way; and just in the edge of the village he knocked down some beehives, and the bees turned out and joined the excursion, and soared along in a black cloud that nearly hid those other two from sight, and prodded them both, and jabbed them and speared them and spiked them, and made them bellow and shriek, and shriek and bellow; and here they came roaring through the village like a hurricane, and took the funeral procession right in the center, and sent that section of it sprawling, and galloped over it, and the rest scattered apart and fled screeching in every direction, every person with a layer of bees on him, and not a rag of that funeral left but the corpse; and finally the bull broke for the river and jumped in, and when they fished Uncle Laxart out he was nearly drowned, and his face looked like a pudding with raisins in it. And then he turned around, this old simpleton, and looked a long time in a dazed way at Joan where she had her face in a <b>cushion,</b> <b>dying,</b> apparently, and says: ...|$|R
