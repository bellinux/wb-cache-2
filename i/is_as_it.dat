One {{component}} {{is a red}} dwarf star of spectral type M4.5V, which orbits a mysterious dense and heavy object—possibly a black hole—every 5.1 hours. The system is an X-ray nova, meaning that it experiences periodic outbursts in the X-ray band of the electromagnetic spectrum. If the system does indeed contain a black hole, {{it would be the}} smallest one ever recorded. Further analysis in 2012 calculated a mass of 2.1 solar masses, which raises questions as to what the object actually <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> appears to be too small to be a black hole.|$|E

The question of whether any ordered subset of a partially ordered set is contained in a maximal ordered subset was answered in the positive by Hausdorff using the well-ordering theorem.

500|$|Some {{people have}} been led to assume that small, skinny tornadoes are always weaker than large, {{wedge-shaped}} tornadoes. [...] There is an observed trend of wider tornadoes causing worse damage. It is unknown whether {{this is due to}} an actual tendency of tornado dynamics or an ability for the tornado to affect a larger area. However, this is not a reliable indicator of an individual tornado's intensity. Some small, rope-like tornadoes, traditionally thought of as weak, have been among the strongest in history.

There Elgar {{recovered}} his strength and, in 1918 and 1919, he produced four large-scale works. The first three of these were chamber pieces: the Violin Sonata in Eminor, the Piano Quintet in A minor, and the String Quartet in E minor. On hearing the work in progress, Alice Elgar wrote in her diary, [...] "E. writing wonderful new music". All three works were well received. The Times wrote, [...] "Elgar's sonata contains much that we have heard before in other forms, but as we do not at all want him to change and be somebody else, that <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> should be." [...] The quartet and quintet were premiered at the Wigmore Hall on 21 May 1919.

40|$|Objectives: To {{describe}} inductively women’s {{perceptions of}} the effects of miscarriage on their interpersonal and sexual couple relationships (IR and SR); and, guided by the Lazarus Emotions and Adaptation Model, to compare IR and SR patterns 1 year after loss for differences in backgrounds, contexts, appraisals, reappraisals, and emotions. Methods: This was a secondary analysis of data gathered at 1, 6, 16, and 52 weeks postmiscarriage from 185 women. Text data were content-analyzed. Relationship differences were examined using MANCOVA with Bonferroni adjusted pairwise comparisons. Results: There were three relationship patterns: closer, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> and more distant. At 1 year, women whose IR (44 %) <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> (vs. closer [23 %] or more distant [32 %]) or whose SR (55 %) <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> (vs. more distant [39 %]) coped less passively and appraised less miscarriage impact. Women whose IR or SR <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> (vs. closer) {{were more likely to have}} children and (vs. more distant), miscarried at an earlier gestation, conceived again, and experienced fewer negative events. Those whose IR <b>was</b> closer or <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> and whose SR <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> (vs. IR or SR more distant) had less disturbed emotions, more emotional strength, and partners who performed more caring acts. Women whose IR was closer and whose SR <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> (vs. more distant) had partners who engaged in more mutual sharing. Conclusions: Women differed in perceptions of how miscarriage affected their IR and SR. The Lazarus Model helped explain those differences.

Archbishop Dziwisz returned the film to McEveety {{and said he had}} watched it with John Paul II. On December 16, Daily Variety reported that the pope had seen the film, and on December 17, The Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan reported that John Paul II had said: [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was," [...] sourcing McEveety, who said he heard it from Dziwisz. National Catholic Reporter journalist John Allen published a similar account on the same day, quoting an unnamed senior Vatican official. The following day, Reuters and the Associated Press each independently confirmed the story, citing Vatican sources. On December 24, an anonymous Vatican official told Catholic News Service, [...] "There was no declaration, no judgment from the pope." [...] On January 9, John Allen defended his earlier reporting, saying that his official source was adamant about the veracity of the original story. In a January 18 column, Frank Rich interviewed the Italian translator who quoted Dziwisz as saying that the pope called the film [...] "incredible" [...] and said [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was." [...] Rich attacked the marketing of the film and suggested Dziwisz wielded too much influence over the pope. The next day Archbishop Dziwisz told CNS, [...] "The Holy Father told no one his opinion of this film."
