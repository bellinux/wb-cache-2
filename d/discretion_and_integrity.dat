40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} two high-involvement approaches to organizing work in retail bank branches: worker <b>discretion</b> <b>and</b> cross-functional flexibility. Both <b>discretion</b> <b>and</b> flexibility have positive effects on productivity and sales effectiveness. The effects of <b>discretion</b> <b>and</b> flexibility on performance in conjunction with one another are significant and negative. The worst performing branches have low-involvement work practices. Branches that have high flexibility or discretion perform better than branches {{with high levels of}} both. ...|$|R

50|$|It {{should be}} noted that the Greek word σωφροσύνης (sōphrosynēs) in the second line is often {{translated}} in English as ′chastity.′ However, this is a highly problematic archaism, since, in modern English, ′chastity′ refers almost exclusively to sexual continence. The Greek word is much broader in meaning and carries the sense of soundness of mind, <b>discretion,</b> <b>and</b> prudence. Therefore, the prayer asks in the second line for a restoration to Christian wholeness <b>and</b> <b>integrity,</b> foreshadowing the petition of the third line that the supplicant might have the temptation to judge others removed from them (cf. Matt. 7:1-5). It is possible that the choice to translate σωφροσύνης as ′chastity′ reflects both the affection for the Cramnerian prose of the Anglican Book of Common Prayer present in some anglophone Orthodox (which frequently leads to an ambiguity of meaning in liturgical and scriptural texts, as exemplified here) and also the presupposition that a concern for sexual purity is predominant in the Orthodox tradition.|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{complexity in}} Military Command and Control (C 2) systems {{has led to}} greater vulnerability due to system availability <b>and</b> <b>integrity</b> caused by internal vulnerabilities and external threats. Several studies have proposed measures of availability <b>and</b> <b>integrity</b> for the assets in the C 2 systems using precise and certain measures (i. e., {{the exact number of}} attacks on the availability <b>and</b> the <b>integrity,</b> the number of countermeasures for the availability <b>and</b> <b>integrity</b> attacks, the effectiveness of the availability <b>and</b> <b>integrity</b> countermeasure in eliminating the threats, and the financial impact of each attack on the availability <b>and</b> <b>integrity</b> of the assets). However, these measures are often uncertain in real-world problems. The source of uncertainty can be vagueness or ambiguity. Fuzzy logic and fuzzy sets can represent vagueness and ambi-guity by formalizing inaccuracies inherent in human decision-making. In this paper, the authors extend the risk assessment literature by including fuzzy measures for the number of attacks on the availability <b>and</b> the <b>integrity,</b> the number of countermeasures for the availability <b>and</b> <b>integrity</b> attacks, <b>and</b> the effectiveness of the availability <b>and</b> <b>integrity</b> countermeasure in eliminating these threats. They analyze the financial impact of each attack on the availability <b>and</b> <b>integrity</b> of the assets and propose a comprehensive cyber-risk assessmen...|$|R
