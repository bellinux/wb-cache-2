5|$|The Aegean prehistorians <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> {{confident}} about their calculations that they rejected early radiocarbon dates in the 1970s for LMI/LCI Thera, as radiocarbon suggested a date about {{a century earlier}} than the traditional dates.|$|E
5|$|Suter and Heisman turned away. 'Can {{you beat}} that?' Suter asked the Auburn coach. Heisman didn't say anything, I guess {{he thought a}} great deal. He told me {{afterwards}} {{that he had never}} <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> sorry for a man on a football field as he had for Suter at that moment.|$|E
5|$|As a scout for the Houston Astros, Hal Newhouser {{evaluated}} Jeter extensively {{before the}} 1992 MLB draft. The Astros held the first overall {{pick in the}} draft, and Newhouser, convinced that Jeter would anchor a winning team, lobbied team management to select him. The Astros feared that Jeter would insist on a salary bonus of at least $1million to forgo his college scholarship for a professional contract, so they passed on him, instead choosing Cal State Fullerton outfielder Phil Nevin, who signed with Houston for $700,000. Newhouser <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> strongly about Jeter's potential that he quit his job with the Astros in protest after they ignored his drafting advice.|$|E

5|$|Matabele raiding parties {{attacked}} the retreating column six times during its two-week journey back to Bulawayo. In pouring rain, the dishevelled men were soon mostly on foot, existing off horse meat and wearing makeshift shoes made from ammunition wallets. Forbes <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> humiliated {{by the events}} that he retreated from command in all but name, surrendering de facto control to Commandant Raaff. In leading the column back to Bulawayo, Raaff repeatedly drew on his experience from the Anglo-Zulu War to ensure {{the survival of the}} haggard men. He avoided several Matabele ambushes, and at one point set up a convincing decoy camp that the Matabele fired on for half a day, wasting much of their ammunition.|$|E
5|$|Matthias {{participated in}} the lengthy Palm Sunday {{ceremony}} in Vienna in 1490, although he had <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> ill that morning {{that he could not}} eat breakfast. Around noon, he tasted a fig that proved to be rotten and he became very agitated and suddenly felt faint. The next day he was unable to speak. After two days of suffering, Matthias died in the morning of 6 April. According to Professor Frigyes Korányi, Matthias died of a stroke; Dr. Herwig Egert does not exclude the possibility of poisoning. Matthias's funeral was held in St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna and he was buried in Székesfehérvár Cathedral on 24 or 25 April 1490.|$|E
5|$|Coutances {{returned}} to Normandy, and in December 1195 attempted to secure {{compensation for the}} losses his archdiocese had sustained in the warfare between King Richard and King Phillip. He sought compensation from both kings but obtained no satisfaction, and <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> ill-treated by the kings that he abandoned his see. The English and the French kings had required clergymen to guarantee the January 1196 Treaty of Louviers that the two kings arranged for themselves, with Richard nominating Coutances as his surety, or guarantor that {{the conditions of the}} treaty would be fulfilled. Part of the treaty laid out that if the archbishop laid an interdict or excommunicated anyone in the lands of King Philip or any subject of King Richard in the archdiocese of Rouen, then the archiepiscopal manor of Andeli should be forfeit to either king until after a special tribunal had determined if the archbishop's punishment was valid.|$|E

5|$|In 1993 the {{evolutionary}} biologist Stephen Jay Gould compared Paley to Voltaire's Doctor Pangloss, {{the man who}} could argue any case (however hopeless). Gould is struck that Paley can claim that even the agonising pain of gallstones or gout could indicate the goodness of a loving God, with the justification that it <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> good when the pain stopped. Gould makes it clear he finds Paley's argument incorrect scientifically, but states that he respects it as a coherent and well-defended philosophy. Gould particularly respects Paley's method of identifying alternative possibilities and then systematically refuting them. Gould notes that Paley envisages a Lamarckist kind of evolution and rebuts it with the observation that men have not lost their nipples through disuse. However, Gould writes, Paley did not manage to think of one more alternative, natural selection, which has no purpose at all but just kills off whatever works less well in every generation.|$|E
5|$|The {{house on}} Hadley Common was a citadel of riotous insolvency—not just at Christmas but every weekend. There {{was a great}} sense of {{in-depth}} back-up, a cellar, a barrel of malt whisky, a walk-in larder: proof against snowstorm or shutdown. I think it was that Christmas morning , that all four Amises, with breakfast trays on their laps, watched Journey to the Centre of the Earth—then the visit to the pub, then the day-long, the week-long lunch. And with Kingsley the hub of all humour and high spirits, like an engine of comedy... I <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> secure in that house—and, clearly, so insecure elsewhere—that I always experienced a caress of apprehension as I climbed into the car on Sunday night, any Sunday night, and headed back to the motorway and Monday, to the flat or the flatlet, the street, the job, the tramp dread, the outside world.|$|E
25|$|I {{told people}} the {{complete}} opposite. I told them I raised it up 140 volts. I <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> bad. I <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> f—ing horrible, man. They said, “Please don’t attempt what Eddie Van Halen {{said in the}} last interview, because everyone was blowing their amps.” Everyone fried their amps ’cause of me. I <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> bad. I never lied again after that.|$|E

25|$|In {{the final}} weeks of his life, Lantos asked that a {{non-profit}} be established {{to carry on the}} work he <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> passionately about. The Tom Lantos Foundation for Human Rights & Justice was founded later that year to carry out that wish. Lantos' daughter, Katrina Lantos Swett, serves as the Foundation's President and CEO.|$|E
25|$|In March 1433 {{she founded}} a monastery at Tor de' Specchi, near the Campidoglio, {{in order to}} allow for a common life by those members of the confraternity who <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> called. This monastery remains the only house of the Institute. That July 4, they {{received}} the approval of Pope Eugene IV as a religious congregation of oblates with private religious vows. The community later became known simply as the Oblates of St. Frances of Rome.|$|E
25|$|What {{eventually}} led to Hamilton being defeated for re-election in 1984, was a 1980 reapportionment battle against the Black Caucus, who wanted the reapportionment figured to their advantage. Hamilton <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> strongly they were wrong, that she ended up testifying before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in 1982. The Black Caucus were so angered by what they {{believed to be a}} betrayal by Hamilton, that they put Mable Thomas against her in the primary. Hamilton lost to Thomas in the run-off election and never held elected office again.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept was}} also {{brought about by}} the lyrics, which are about sneaking out in the night and getting up to no good without your parents knowing. The idea of her {{crawling}} through her bed into this other world made it fantastical and have creative licence to have a few surreal elements. The bed scene was made up of thirty or so mattresses inside a tent of giant silk. The light was amazing, and once inside the bed set it <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> calming and peaceful. This serenity really reflects Pixie's performance in this section.|$|E
25|$|According to Woolf's memoirs, {{her most}} vivid {{childhood}} memories were not of London but of St Ives, Cornwall, {{where the family}} spent every summer until 1895. The Stephens' summer home, Talland House, looked out over Porthminster Bay, and is still standing, though somewhat altered. Memories of these family holidays and impressions of the landscape, especially the Godrevy Lighthouse, informed the fiction Woolf wrote in later years, most notably To the Lighthouse. She describes why she <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> connected to Talland House in a diary entry dated March 22, 1921.|$|E
25|$|In 1841 William II of the Netherlands, as Grand Duke of Luxembourg, {{created the}} Order of the Oak Crown. Although this was officially not a Dutch order, honours were {{regularly}} conferred on Dutch people. After {{the death of}} William III, Luxembourg, according to the House-treaty, became {{the domain of the}} other branch of the House of Nassau. In the Netherlands the need for a third order, beside the Military William Order and Order of the Netherlands Lion was <b>felt,</b> <b>so</b> that royal honours could be conferred upon foreign diplomats and people from lower ranks and classes.|$|E

5000|$|The {{leaves are}} remarkably densely <b>felted,</b> <b>so</b> much <b>so</b> that the <b>felt</b> can be {{stripped}} off, dried, {{and used as}} tinder. The plant is accordingly called [...] "tontelbos" [...] in Afrikaans. The word means [...] "tinder bush". Though its flowers are nothing special to look at, the plant is striking, easily grown, and fairly attractive; a plucked stem, or even a leaf, can be stuck into warm, not-too-dry earth, where it will strike root without special attention. Like most Richtersveld plants it does not do well in wet soil, but is not in general a demanding garden subject.|$|R
60|$|He {{held her}} face between his two hands, and indeed {{it seemed as}} if he could not satiate his soul with looking into her eyes. In the midst of so much sorrow, such misery and such deadly fear, never had Marguerite <b>felt</b> quite <b>so</b> happy, never had she <b>felt</b> him <b>so</b> {{completely}} her own. The inevitable bodily weakness, which of necessity had invaded even his splendid physique after a whole week's privations, had made a severe breach in the invincible barrier of self-control with which the soul of the inner man was kept perpetually hidden behind a mask of indifference and of irresponsibility.|$|R
25|$|A {{friend who}} was a vest-maker offered to teach her the trade, and to help her to get work, and this enabled her to carry out her plan of going to New York. She took a small room in the city, and went home only for Sundays, as the {{communication}} between Williamsburg and New York was very slow in those days, and the journey could not be made in leas than three hours. Two rooms were always kept ready for her in her parents' house, and those Sundays at home {{must have been a}} great rest and pleasure to her, though her family <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> little sympathy in her literary work that she rarely mentioned it at home.|$|E
25|$|In 233, someone {{reported}} to the imperial court that Cao Gun had violated a curfew by walking on the streets at night when he visited Luoyang {{in the winter of}} 231. Cao Rui knew that Cao Gun had a reputation for his virtuous and good behaviour, so he wanted to overlook this transgression and issue only an official warning to Cao Gun. However, after some officials pressured him, Cao Rui decided to punish Cao Gun by removing two counties, with a total of 750 taxable households, from his princedom. Cao Gun <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> distressed and upset that he instructed his subordinates to be more mindful in the future. Cao Rui appreciated Cao Gun's expression of remorse, so he returned the two counties to Cao Gun in the following year.|$|E
25|$|In {{the ancient}} past, {{there was a}} hero named Hou Yi who was {{excellent}} at archery. His wife was Chang'e. One year, the ten suns rose in the sky together, causing great disaster to people. Yi shot down nine of the suns and left only one to provide light. An immortal admired Yi and sent him the elixir of immortality. Yi {{did not want to}} leave Chang'e and be immortal without her, so he let Chang'e keep the elixir. But Peng Meng, one of his apprentices, knew this secret. So, on the fifteenth of August in the lunar calendar, when Yi went hunting, Peng Meng broke into Yi's house and forced Chang'e to give the elixir to him. Chang'e refused to do so. Instead, she swallowed it and flew into the sky. Since she loved very much her husband and hoped to live nearby, she chose the moon for her residence. When Yi came back and learned what had happened, he <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> sad that he displayed the fruits and cakes Chang'e liked in the yard and gave sacrifices to his wife. People soon learned about these activities, and since they also were sympathetic to Chang'e they participated in these sacrifices with Yi.|$|E
