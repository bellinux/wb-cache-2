5|$|The League of Nations lacked {{an armed}} force {{of its own}} and {{depended}} on the Great Powers to enforce its resolutions, which they were very unwilling to <b>do.</b> <b>Its</b> two most important members, Britain and France, were reluctant to use sanctions and even more reluctant to resort to military action {{on behalf of the}} League. Immediately after the First World War, pacifism became a strong force among both the people and governments of the two countries. The British Conservatives were especially tepid to the League and preferred, when in government, to negotiate treaties without the involvement of that organisation. Moreover, the League's advocacy of disarmament for Britain, France, and its other members, {{while at the same time}} advocating collective security, meant that the League was depriving itself of the only forceful means by which it could uphold its authority.|$|E
5|$|The Sind sparrow (Passer pyrrhonotus) is a {{passerine}} bird of the sparrow family Passeridae, found {{around the}} Indus valley region in South Asia. It {{is also known}} as the jungle, Sind jungle, or rufous-backed sparrow. Very similar to the related house sparrow, it is smaller and has distinguishing plumage features. As in the house sparrow, the male has brighter plumage than female and young birds, including black markings and a grey crown. Distinctively, the male has a chestnut stripe running down its head behind the eye, and the female has a darker head than other sparrow species <b>do.</b> <b>Its</b> main vocalisations are soft chirping calls that are extended into longer songs with other sounds interspersed by breeding males. Historically, this species was thought to be very closely related to the house sparrow, but its closest evolutionary affinities may lie elsewhere. Discovered around 1840, this species went undetected for several decades after its discovery.|$|E

5|$|When a {{representative}} of the Society of Silent Flower Observers of Southern California comes to the shop to evaluate the plant, she announces that Seymour will receive a trophy from them, and that she will return when the plant's buds open. While Seymour is on a date with Audrey, Mushnick stays at the shop to see that Audrey Jr. does not hurt anyone else. After trading barbs with the plant when Audrey awakens and demands to be fed, Mushnick finds himself at the mercy of Kloy Haddock, a robber who pretended to be a customer of the previous day, and believes that the huge crowd he had observed attending the shop indicated the presence of a large amount of money. To save his own life, Mushnick tricks Haddock into thinking that the money is with the plant, which crushes and eats him. Not only does the monstrous plant's growth increase with this latest meal, but its intelligence and abilities do as well. It intimidates Mr. Mushnick, who is now more terrified than ever, but not so much that he will forgo the money the plant is bringing in as an attraction. After he is forced to damage his relationship with Audrey to keep her from discovering the plant's nature, an angry Seymour confronts the plant asserting he will no longer <b>do</b> <b>its</b> bidding just because it orders him to. The plant then employs hypnosis on the feckless lad and commands him to bring it more food. He wanders the night streets aimlessly until pursued by a rather aggressively persistent street walker Leonora Clyde, intent on making a score. Believing him harmless, she flirts with him to no avail until he inadvertently knocks her out with a rock and carries her back to feed Audrey Jr.|$|E

25|$|Brown sugar comes {{either from}} the late stages of cane sugar refining, when sugar forms fine {{crystals}} with significant molasses content, or from coating white refined sugar with a cane molasses syrup (blackstrap molasses).

Brown sugars also tend to harden if exposed to the atmosphere, although proper handling can reverse this.|$|E

25|$|Benzoic acid occurs {{naturally}} as <b>do</b> <b>its</b> esters in many {{plant and}} animal species. Appreciable amounts {{have been found in}} most berries (around 0.05%). Ripe fruits of several Vaccinium species (e.g., cranberry, V. vitis macrocarpon; bilberry, V. myrtillus) contain as much as 0.03–0.13% free benzoic acid. Benzoic acid is also formed in apples after infection with the fungus Nectria galligena. Among animals, benzoic acid has been identified primarily in omnivorous or phytophageous species, e.g., in viscera and muscles of the rock ptarmigan (Lagopus muta) as well as in gland secretions of male muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus) or Asian bull elephants (Elephas maximus).|$|E
25|$|The Federal Railroad Administration is {{investigating}} multiple safety issues with crude oil shipments, {{which are the}} fastest-growing hazardous material shipments by rail.

25|$|Gold is a {{soft metal}} (MH 2.5–3) that is easily deformed. It has a {{close-packed}} face-centred cubic structure (BCN 12). The chemistry of gold {{is dominated by}} its +3 valence state; all such compounds of gold feature covalent bonding, as <b>do</b> <b>its</b> stable +1 compounds. Gold oxide (Au2O3) is amphoteric, with acidic properties predominating; it forms anionic hydroxoaurates M where M = Na, K, Ba, Tl; and aurates such as NaAuO2. Gold is a constituent of Zintl phases such as M2AuBi (M = Li or Na); Li2AuM (M = In, Tl, Ge, Pb, Sn) and Ca5Au4.|$|E

Gates announced he would focus on three main areas while he served as governor; industrial growth, highway construction, and improved health care. He also urged the legislature to reform state taxes and spending and predicted a fall in tax revenues as the war ended.|$|E
25|$|In 1901 the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba {{changed the}} University Act {{so that the}} {{university}} could <b>do</b> <b>its</b> own teaching, and in 1905 a building in downtown Winnipeg became its first teaching facility {{with a staff of}} six science professors. The governance was modelled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906 which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and to perform institutional leadership.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, {{there are}} number of {{secondary}} and tertiary associations of housing co-operatives. The major national organization is the Co-operative Housing Federation of Canada (CHF Canada). Most provinces have similar organizations for their area, {{but many are}} stand-alone members of the CHF Canada, {{as opposed to being}} branches of it. Each such organization charges its member co-operatives a fee {{based on the number of}} housing units in the co-op to pay for staff to <b>do</b> <b>its</b> work. This includes advocacy to governments, setting up self-help funding and the like. These organizations do not act for individual members, and do not give members advice when the member encounters problems with the Board of their co-op. In most jurisdictions there are no organizations for members of housing co-operatives, in contrast with tenants in a traditional landlord-and-tenant relationship, who can be assisted by various tenant advocacy groups.|$|E
