50|$|On launch, a small {{gyroscope}} is spun up by {{the firing}} of a powder pellet. The missile is propelled into the air by a booster motor, which takes the missile to its flight speed of approximately 85 meters per second. As it leaves the launcher box, four wings unfold, which begin to spin the missile in flight, which provides a degree of stability. Once the missile has travelled about 30 meters the gyro is unlocked and operator-controlled flight begins. Once 40 meters of wire has deployed {{from one of the}} missile's two spools, the sustainer motor is ignited along with up to four <b>tracer</b> <b>flares</b> {{in the back of the}} missile. At 45 meters range, the booster motor runs out. Once 230 meters of wire have deployed from the second spool of wire, the missile's shaped charge warhead is armed.|$|R
50|$|The {{business}} outgrew its {{facilities in}} Elizabeth {{and moved to}} Roswell Park in 1932. In ten more years the company had once more outgrown these facilities and moved to Summit, New Jersey where it currently resides. In May, 1942 the Summit location opened and was immediately contracted by the US Army and Navy to produce materials for World War II. From 1942 to 1945 the company produced parts for tanks, warships and airplanes. Over one million pounds of magnesium powder were produced for <b>tracer</b> bullets and <b>flares.</b> During this time the Summit location was heavily guarded.|$|R

Once the user clicks on red and brown information points branching out from correlating screens the red spots darken slightly while the brown spots become hollow. After extensive exploration of the project the page takes on the sight of a battlefield, littered with red <b>tracers,</b> <b>dried</b> blood spots and bullet holes.|$|R
5000|$|American Legion, {{still lay}} off [...] "Red" [...] Beach {{in the predawn}} hours of the 9th, too, and began observing heavy gunfire commencing at 01:48 to the northwestward. Lookouts also saw <b>flares</b> and <b>tracers,</b> with {{parachute}} <b>flares</b> brightly lighting up the area to the northeastward. Transport Group [...] "X-ray" [...] ceased discharging cargo and darkened ship, remaining shut down {{for the rest of}} the night, crews at general quarters. American Legion men did not know it at the time, but they were witnessing the disastrous Battle of Savo Island, in which three American heavy cruisers were sunk, one American heavy cruiser damaged and an Australian heavy cruiser sunk.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of improved pyrotechnic systems like ignitors, <b>flares,</b> <b>tracers</b> or inflaming agents searches always for new energetic metallic compounds which allow to adapt this systems to specific application. Purpose {{of this research}} was to study the feasibility of using a new developed boron-rich material as combustible. Raw material was mechanical alloyed iron powder with 50 % boron (by weight). The elementary powders were mixed in a high-energy mill for 36 hours in inert atmosphere. This material was characterised by differential thermal analysis, sieve analysis, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The material thus obtained was compared with elemental Fe, elemental B, and plain elemental mix of Fe and B powders (50 % wt., not mechanically alloyed). A spatula tip of every mixture was ignited under atmospheric conditions. The data analysis of each spectrum by comparing with a calculated one results in combustion temperatures and emission properties. Mechanically alloyed Fe-B show a completely different combustion behaviour as the mixture with pure boron and iron of the same stoechiometry. The Fe-B alloy reduces combustion temperature and degreases burning time...|$|R
40|$|We present {{observations}} of an X 1 flare (18 Jul. 1991) detected simultaneously with the Very Large Array (VLA), the PHOENIX Digital Radio Spectrometer and the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) aboard the Gamma Ray Observatory (GRO). The VLA {{was used to}} produce snapshot maps of the impulsive acceleration in the higher corona several minutes {{before the onset of}} the hard x ray burst detected by BATSE. Comparisons with high spectral and temporal observations by PHOENIX reveal a variety of radio bursts at 20 cm, such as type 3 bursts, intermediate drift bursts, and quasi-periodic pulsations during different stages of the X 1 flare. From the drift rates of these radio bursts we derive information on local density scale heights, the speed of radio exciters, and the local magnetic field. Radio emission at 90 cm shows a type 4 burst moving outward with a constant velocity of 240 km/s. The described X 1 flare is unique {{in the sense that it}} appeared at the east limb (N 06 /E 88), providing the most accurate information on the vertical structure of different <b>flare</b> <b>tracers</b> visible in radio wavelengths...|$|R
30|$|With {{estimated}} {{shale gas}} resources {{greater than those}} of US and Canada combined, China has been embarking on an ambitious shale development program. However, nearly 30  years of American experience in shale hydrocarbon exploration and production indicates a low total recovery of shale gas at 12  %– 30  % and tight oil at 5  %– 10  %. One of the main barriers to sustainable development of shale resources, namely the pore structure (geometry and connectivity) of the nanopores for storing and transporting hydrocarbons, is rarely investigated. In this study, we collected samples {{from a variety of}} leading hydrocarbon-producing shale formations in US and China. These formations have different ages and geologic characteristics (e.g., porosity, permeability, mineralogy, total organic content, and thermal maturation). We studied their pore structure characteristics, imbibition and saturated diffusion, edge-accessible porosity, and wettability with four complementary tests: mercury intrusion porosimetry, fluid and tracer imbibition into initially <b>dry</b> shale, <b>tracer</b> diffusion into fluid-saturated shale, and high-pressure Wood’s metal intrusion followed with imaging and elemental mapping. The imbibition and diffusion tests use tracer-bearing wettability fluids (API brine or n-decane) to examine the association of tracers with mineral or organic matter phases, using a sensitive and micro-scale elemental laser ablation ICP-MS mapping technique. For two molecular tracers in n-decane fluid with the estimated sizes of 1.39  nm ×  0.29  nm ×  0.18  nm for 1 -iododecane and 1.27  nm ×  0.92  nm ×  0.78  nm for trichlorooxobis (triphenylphosphine) rhenium, much less penetration was observed for larger molecules of organic rhenium in shales with median pore-throat sizes of several nanometers. This indicates the probable entanglement of sub-nano-sized molecules in shales with nano-sized pore-throats. Overall findings from the above innovative approaches indicate the limited accessibility (several millimeters from sample edge) and connectivity of tortuous nanopore spaces in shales with spatial wettability, which could lead to the low overall hydrocarbon recovery because of the limited fracture–matrix connection and migration of hydrocarbon molecules from the shale matrix to the stimulated fracture network.|$|R
40|$|Drying {{suspensions}} of colloidal nanoparticles {{exhibit a}} variety of interesting strain release mechanisms during film formation. These result {{in the selection of}} characteristic length scales during failure processes such as cracking and subsequent delamination. A wide range of materials (e. g., bulk metallic glasses) release strain through plastic deformations which occur in a narrow band of material known as a shear band. Here we show that drying colloidal films also exhibit shear banding. Bands are observed to form a small distance behind the drying front and then to propagate rapidly at ∼ 45 � to the direction of drying. It is shown that the spacing of the bands depends on salt concentration and the evaporation rate of the colloidal suspension. These combined observations suggest that there is a critical shear rate (related to the film yield stress) which controls the ratio of bandwidth to band spacing. Local deformations were measured {{in the early stages of}} <b>drying</b> using fluorescent <b>tracer</b> particles. The measurements were used to show that the existence of shear bands is linked to the compaction of particles perpendicular to the drying front. The spacing of shear bands was also found to be strongly correlated with the characteristic length scale of the compaction process. These combined studies elucidate the role of plastic deformation during pattern formation in drying films of colloidal nanoparticles...|$|R
40|$|Gas {{atomized}} magnesium powders {{are critical}} {{for the production of}} a wide variety of <b>flares,</b> <b>tracer</b> projectiles, and other munitions for the United States military, along with a growing number of applications in both alloying and powder metallurgy. Gas atomization of magnesium is performed by numerous companies worldwide, but represents a single point failure within the United States as there is only one domestic producer. These powders are pyrophoric and must be handled carefully and kept dry at all times. Recent studies have explored the ability of certain fluorine containing cover gases to protect molten magnesium in casting operations from excessive vaporization and burning by modifying the native oxide (MgO) through interaction with these gas atmospheres. The present study sought to adapt this melt protection strategy for use as an in-situ passivation technique that could be employed to form a protective reaction film during gas atomization of magnesium powders. This fluorinated oxide shell was intended to provide superior coverage and adherence to the underlying metal, which may improve the ability of powders to resist ignition at elevated temperatures and during powder handling. Two candidate gases were tested in this research, SF 6 and NF 3, and reaction films of both were produced on miniature melt samples in a controlled environment and characterized using auger electron spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Ultimately, SF 6 was chosen to conduct a small scale magnesium atomization experiment for verification of the fluorination reaction and to experimentally test the ignition temperature of these coated particles compared to other magnesium powders available today. This novel passivation technique was found to be far superior to magnesium 2 ̆ 7 s native oxide at resisting ignition and, thus, to reduce the hazard associated with handling and transport of magnesium powders for defense applications. If fully commercialized, this passivation method also may open up a new arena for powder metallurgy processing of structural parts from Mg and Mg alloy powders...|$|R
40|$|Megacities are extreme {{examples}} of the continuously growing urbanization of human population that pose (new) challenges {{to the environment and}} human health at a local scale. However, because of their size megacities also have larger-scale effects and {{more research is needed to}} quantify their regional and global scale impacts. We performed a study of the characteristics of plumes dispersing from a group of thirty-six of world's megacities using the Lagrangian particle model FLEXPART and focusing on black carbon (BC) emissions during the years 2003 – 2005. BC was selected since it is representative of combustion-related emissions and it has a significant role as a short-lived climate forcer. Based on the BC emissions two tracers were modeled; a purely passive tracer and one subject to wet and <b>dry</b> deposition. These <b>tracers</b> allowed us to investigate the role of deposition processes in determining the impact of megacities' pollutant plumes. The particles composing the plumes have been sampled in space and time. The time sampling allowed us to investigate the evolution of the plume from its release up to 48 days after emission and to generalize our results for any substance decaying with a time scale sufficiently shorter than the time window of 48 days. The physical characteristics of the time averaged plume have been investigated and this showed that although local conditions are important, overall the latitude of the city is the main factor influencing both the local and the regional-to-global dispersion of the megacities' plumes. We also repeated the calculations of some of the regional-pollution-potential metrics previously proposed by Lawrence et al. (2007), thus extending their results to a depositing scalar and retaining the evolution in time for all the plumes. Noteworthy our results agreed well with the previous results despite being obtained using a totally different modeling framework. For the environmental impact on a global scale we focused on the export of mass from the megacities to the sensitive polar regions. We found that the sole city of Saint Petersburg contributes more to the lower troposphere pollution and deposition in the Arctic than the whole ensemble of Asian megacities. In general this study showed that the pollution of urban origin in the lower troposphere of the Arctic is mainly generated by northern European sources. We also found that the deposition of BC in the Antarctic due to megacities is comparable to the emissions generated by local shipping activities. Finally multiplying population and ground level concentration maps, we found that the exposure of human population to megacities pollution occurs mainly inside the city boundaries and this is especially true if deposition is accounted for. However, some exceptions exist (Beijing, Tianjin, Karachi) where the impact on population outside city boundary is larger than that inside city boundary...|$|R
