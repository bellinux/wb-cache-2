The principals agreed to at least a one-race deal, which became a much longer term deal when Kulwicki recorded an eighth-place finish <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>race.</b> Later in the season, Kulwicki won the Bristol night race for his third career win. In 29races, he had eleven top10 finishes, fourpoles, and finished 13th in the points.|$|E
