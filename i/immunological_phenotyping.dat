40|$|Amorphic {{mutations}} in the recombination activating genes RAG 1 and RAG 2 {{have been reported}} to cause T–B– SCID, whereas hypomorphic mutations led to the expansion of a few autoimmune T cell clones responsible for the Omenn syndrome phenotype. We report here a novel clinical and <b>immunological</b> <b>phenotype</b> associated with recessive RAG 1 hypomorphic {{mutations in}} 4 patients from 4 different families. The <b>immunological</b> <b>phenotype</b> consists of the oligoclonal expansion of TCRγδ T cells combined with TCRαβ T cell lymphopenia. The clinical phenotype consists of severe, disseminated CMV infection and autoimmune blood cell manifestations. Repertoire studies suggest that CMV infection, in the setting of this particular T cell immunodeficiency, may have driven the TCRγδ T cell clonal expansion.

40|$|Host {{immunity}} {{is a major}} {{driver of}} pathogen evolution and thus {{a major determinant of}} pathogen diversity. Explanations for pathogen diversity traditionally assume simple interactions between pathogens and the immune system, a view encapsulated by the susceptible–infected–recovered (SIR) model. However, there is growing evidence that the complexity of many host–pathogen interactions is dynamically important. This revised perspective requires broadening the definition of a pathogen’s <b>immunological</b> <b>phenotype,</b> or what {{can be thought of as}} its immunological niche. After reviewing evidence that interactions between pathogens and host immunity drive much of pathogen evolution, I introduce the concept of a pathogen’s <b>immunological</b> <b>phenotype.</b> Models that depart from the SIR paradigm demonstrate the utility of this perspective and show that it is particularly useful in understanding vaccine-induced evolution. This paper highlights questions in immunology, evolution, and ecology that must be answered to advance theories of pathogen diversity...|$|R

40|$|During {{the past}} 6 years, {{clinical}} trials employing alpha-interferon (alpha-IFN) in hairy cell leukemia (HCL) have shown dramatic {{improvement in the}} management of this disease. Complete remissions (CR), however, are relatively rare (10 - 15 %) and a minority of patients (10 - 25 %) do not respond adequately to alpha-IFN. The possibility that the poor response to alpha-IFN treatment could be related to a peculiar <b>immunological</b> <b>phenotype</b> of the hairy cell (HC) was investigated in this study. The results demonstrated that, in the majority of patients who failed to respond to alpha-IFN, HC showed an <b>immunological</b> <b>phenotype</b> characterized by positivity with the CD 5 monoclonal antibody which is usually absent on HC and characteristically expressed on B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. In fact, among the 10 HCL patients who presented with this phenotype, only 5 partial remissions (PR) and 5 minor responses (MR) were achieved, as opposed to the 3 complete remissions (CR), 19 PR and 3 MR observed in the 25 CD 5 -negative patients. The possibility that a more extensive immunological analysis of HCL patients at diagnosis may be predictive of the response to IFN treatment is postulated...|$|R
40|$|X-linked {{agammaglobulinemia}} {{is caused}} by mutations in the BTK gene, which result in a precursor B-cell differentiation arrest in the bone marrow {{and the absence of}} or strongly reduced B lymphocytes in blood. We identified a patient with a mild clinical phenotype, low numbers of B lymphocytes, and a splice-site mutation in the BTK gene. The precursor B-cell compartment in the bone marrow of this patient was almost identical to that in healthy children. Using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we were able to detect low levels of wild-type BTK transcripts in his granulocytes. Therefore, we speculated that wild-type BTK transcripts might be responsible for a milder clinical and <b>immunological</b> <b>phenotype,</b> as has been shown in several other diseases. Consequently, we quantified the expression of wild-type BTK transcripts in granulocytes of eight additional patients with splice-site mutations and compared their phenotypes with 17 patients with other types of BTK mutations. In these eight patients, the presence of low levels of wild-type BTK transcripts did not show a clear correlation with the percentage, absolute number, or immunophenotype of B lymphocytes nor with age or serum immunoglobulin levels at diagnosis. Nevertheless, we postulate that the presence of wild-type BTK transcripts {{can be one of the}} many factors that influence the clinical and <b>immunological</b> <b>phenotype</b> in X-linked agammaglobulinemia...|$|R
40|$|ES- 62 is a {{secreted}} protein of filarial nematodes that possesses multiple immunomodulatory activities. A full {{characterization of}} these activities awaits elucidation but to date {{it has been shown}} that ES- 62 can inhibit pro-inflammatory/Th 1 immune responses and in some studies, it has been found to actively support Th 2 development. As an active filarial nematode infection is associated with a Th 2 -like <b>immunological</b> <b>phenotype,</b> this study investigated whether ES- 62 was likely to be responsible for, or at least contribute to, this phenotype. Specifically, we determined ES- 62 's effect on the immune response to two other filarial nematode antigens, chosen for their ability to promote Th 1 responses. The two antigens were recombinant Onchocerca volvulus-Fatty acid And Retinol-binding- 1 (rOv-FAR- 1) and recombinant Onchocerca volvulus-Activation associated Secreted Protein- 1 (Ov-ASP- 1). Overall the results show that in spite of its previously characterized immunomodulatory properties, ES- 62 was unable to modulate/reverse the Th 1 immune responses induced by the two Onchocerca antigens. Therefore, in this study no support is provided for the idea that ES- 62 might be a major player in facilitating the overall <b>immunological</b> <b>phenotype</b> in filariasis and reasons for this somewhat surprising outcome are discussed...|$|R

30|$|Today, flow-cytometric {{assessment}} of the mHLA-DR expression {{may serve as a}} standardized “global” biomarker to evaluate immune function. Persisting reduced mHLA-DR expression reflects a distinct <b>immunological</b> <b>phenotype</b> that is associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, mHLA-DR assessment currently requires specialized laboratories that may not be available in all institutions. Following demonstration of immunological efficiency, biomarker-guided immunological interventions for injury-associated immunosuppression should now be performed in adequately characterized populations using relevant patient-centered clinical outcomes (e.g., mortality). We postulate that in the future of intensive care, personalized medicine that considers the individual immune functionality will be needed to significantly improve the outcome of affected patients.|$|R

40|$|Tuberculosis {{is caused}} by {{different}} groups of bacteria belonging to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC). The combined action of human factors, environmental conditions and bacterial virulence determine the extent and form of human disease. MTBC virulence is a composite of different clinical phenotypes such as transmission rate and disease severity among others. Clinical phenotypes are also influenced by cellular and <b>immunological</b> <b>phenotypes.</b> MTBC phenotypes {{are determined by the}} genotype, therefore finding genotypes responsible for clinical phenotypes would allow discovering MTBC virulence factors. Different MTBC strains display different cellular and clinical phenotypes. Strains from Lineage 5 and Lineage 6 are metabolically different, grow slower, and are less virulent. Also, at least certain groups of Lineage 2 and Lineage 4 strains are more virulent in terms of disease severity and human-to-human transmission. Because phenotypic differences are ultimately caused by genotypic differences, different genomic loci have been related to various cellular and clinical phenotypes. However, defining the impact of specific bacterial genomic loci on virulence when other bacterial determinants, human and environmental factors are also impacting the phenotype would contribute to a better knowledge of tuberculosis virulence and ultimately benefit tuberculosis control...|$|R

Immunological abnormalities have been described, but are generally given little attention in studies on CHARGE syndrome. However, structured information on immunological abnormalities in CHARGE patients is necessary to develop optimal guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up in these patients. Here, we provide an overview of the current literature on immunological abnormalities in CHARGE syndrome.

40|$|ES- 62 is {{a protein}} that is {{actively}} secreted by filarial nematodes during parasitism of the vertebrate host. The molecule {{is able to}} directly interact {{with a number of}} cells of the immune system including B-lymphocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages and mast cells. Interaction appears to be dependent on complexing with TLR 4 and results in modulation of the activity of a number of signal transduction molecules including MAP kinases, PI- 3 kinase and NF-kappaB. Immunomodulatory activity of ES- 62 appears to be largely due to the presence of phosphorylcholine (PC) moieties covalently attached to N-type glycans. The net effect of ES- 62 's interaction with the immune system is the generation of an anti-inflammatory <b>immunological</b> <b>phenotype.</b> As a consequence of this, ES- 62 demonstrates striking drug-like activity in models of disease associated with aberrant inflammation, in particular those associated with autoimmunity and allergy...|$|R
