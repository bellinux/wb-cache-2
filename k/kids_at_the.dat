25|$|The scene late in {{the film}} where Grier, Lawrence, and Murphy hug {{in front of the}} Empire State Building was shot around one or two o'clock in the morning, when the lights are usually shut off. If the filmmakers had them shut off at their command, it would have cost them $40–$60,000, so instead Hudlin had the three hug, and the lights were {{eventually}} shut off as usual. When editing the film, they simply reversed the footage to make it appear as if the lights were being turned on. The filmmakers even thought about ending the movie at this point, deciding instead to go with Marcus attempting to win back Angela's affection. For this, an alternate ending was shot where Angela is teaching the <b>kids</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> school and Marcus comes, talks to her and eventually wins her back; the filmmakers thought it was slow and uninteresting, and eventually came up with the released version.|$|E

Akin finds it hard to adapt to the life in the Village: He asks the family for a cutlery to eat 'swallow' food and he is laughed at, He is also unable to sleep with the others on bed and goes to sleep on the veranda. He finds it hard to sleep on the Veranda again due to mosquitoes. He gets up and calls Mary instead and they get to discuss many things like the fact that her sister's sin is that she beats her husband and she's accused of pulling her husband's penis this time around.

500|$|On June 24, 2007, just a {{few hours}} before their concert at Deer Lake Park, The White Stripes kicked off their cross-Canada tour by playing a 40-minute set for a group of 30 <b>kids</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Creekside Youth Centre in Burnaby. The Canadian tour was also marked by concerts in small markets, such as Glace Bay, Whitehorse and Iqaluit, as well as by {{frequent}} [...] "secret shows" [...] publicized mainly by posts on The Little Room, a White Stripes fan messageboard. Gigs included performances at a bowling alley in Saskatoon, a youth center in Edmonton, a Winnipeg Transit bus and The Forks park in Winnipeg, a park in Whitehorse, the YMCA in downtown Toronto, the Arva Flour Mill in Arva, Ontario, Locas on Salter (a pool hall) in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and a famous one-note show on George Street in St. John's, Newfoundland. They played a full show later that night at the Mile One Centre in downtown St. John's. Video clips from several of the secret shows have been posted to YouTube.

500|$|The {{film has}} {{received}} mixed reviews. Some reviewers disliked Bond's clown costume, gorilla outfit and Tarzan yell during a jungle chase. James Berardinelli {{claimed that the}} movie was long and confusing, and strongly criticised Steven Berkoff's performance, describing it as [...] "offensively bad" [...] and the worst performance of any Bond villain. By contrast, the elegance of the film locations in India, and the stunts on aircraft and the train were appreciated. Jeffrey Westhoff at Rotten Tomatoes praised Roger Moore as being [...] "". Neal Gabler and Jeffrey Lyons at the TV-show Sneak Previews praised the film and said [...] "Octopussy delivers" [...] and [...] "The nice thing about Octopussy is that it's going back-to-basics, less gadgets, more hand-to-hand combat. It's more of an adventure movie in a more traditional sense and I like it for that". Danny Peary wrote that Octopussy [...] "has slow spots, little humour, and villains who aren’t nearly of the calibre of Dr. No, Goldfinger, or Blofeld. Also, the filmmakers {{make the mistake of}} demeaning Bond by having him swing through the trees and emitting a Tarzan cry and having him hide in a gorilla suit and later disguise himself as a clown (who all the <b>kids</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> circus laugh at). It’s as if they’re trying to remind us that everything is tongue-in-cheek, but that makes little sense, for the film is much more serious than typical Bond outings – in fact, it recalls the tone of From Russia with Love." [...] Entertainment Weekly chose Octopussy as the third worst Bond film, while Norman Wilner of MSN chose it as the eighth worst, and IGN chose it as the seventh worst. The review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a 42% rating.|$|E
2500|$|The episode has {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. While reviewing the eleventh season of The Simpsons, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented that [...] "With such a silly concept, [...] probably should flop. However, it actually works pretty well. The best moments come {{from those that}} feature the <b>kids</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> zoo, but a mix of other amusing scenes emerge. Though the show often threatens to falter, it usually succeeds." [...] Nancy Basile of About.com, on the other hand, listed the episode {{as one of the}} worst episodes of the season—the episodes that [...] "made me cringe because they included blatant gimmicks and outlandish plots".|$|E

2500|$|On {{the subject}} of his religion, Hawke {{previously}} wrote, while attending the 1952 World Christian Youth Conference in India, that [...] "there were all these poverty stricken <b>kids</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> gate of this palatial place where we were feeding our face and I just had this struck by this enormous sense of irrelevance of religion to the needs of people". He subsequently abandoned his Christian beliefs. By the time he entered politics he was a self-described agnostic. Hawke told Andrew Denton in 2008 that his father's Christian faith had continued to influence his outlook, saying [...] "My father said if you believe in the fatherhood of God you must necessarily believe in the brotherhood of man, it follows necessarily, and even though I left the church and was not religious, that truth remained with me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Aquaman's first media {{appearance}} was {{as the star}} of his own animated series, The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure, in 1967 and 1968. The series, narrated by Ted Knight, {{proved to be a}} success for everyone, including Filmation studios as it cemented their reputation as a leading provider of Saturday morning programming, the CBS television network - where it was a top rated show making CBS the leading network on Saturday mornings, and of course it was a hit with the viewers, briefly making Aquaman a household name among <b>kids</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, as well as comic-book fans who consider it a superior showcase for the character than the better known Super Friends series that followed 5 years later. The series featured Mera, Aqualad, a pet walrus named Tusky and Aquaman's and Aqualad's large seahorses, named Storm and Imp respectively. In addition to his usual array of abilities, this version of Aquaman had the power to throw [...] "water balls," [...] which had considerable concussive impact. Aquaman's character voice was provided by Marvin Miller, who was then better known as the voice of Robby the Robot from Forbidden Planet.|$|E

Although Douglas' former coach, Walker, stated in 2012 that she was convinced Douglas could {{have made it to}} the Olympics if she had remained in Virginia Beach, Douglas said, [...] "Something clicked in my head that said, if I really want to make this happen I need to get better coaching." [...] The impetus for Douglas's move to Iowa was when Walker had invited Chow to teach a clinic at her gym, Excalibur. Douglas was impressed when Chow was able to teach her how to perform the Amanar vault in a single afternoon. Douglas considered a move to Texas to train with a renowned coach there, but after that coach declined to train her out of loyalty to Walker, Douglas selected Chow. Chow was initially skeptical, since Douglas had been just one of hundreds of <b>kids</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> clinic in Virginia Beach. However, Chow subsequently informed Douglas's Excalibur coaches that he had agreed to train her, but pointed out that he did not recruit her, saying, [...] "I would never recruit anybody to my program."
