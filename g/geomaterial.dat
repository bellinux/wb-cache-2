Research on the stress-strain relationship of the <b>geomaterial</b> is necessary, which guides the design and sustainability of the systems constructed with the <b>geomaterial.</b> Based on elliptic-parabolic yield surfaces model, incremental stress-strain equations were established to characterise mechanical response of the material.

The primary goal of the approach is to provide a possible solution to solve the two intrinsic problems associated with the current main-stream methods for geomechanics. The problems are (1) the constitutive models and parameters of soils and rocks cannot be given accurately in geomechanical prediction; and (2) there are numerous constitutive models of soils and rocks in the literature. The problems are possibly caused by the homogenization or averaging method in analyzing laboratory test results for establishing the constitutive models and parameters. The averaging method employs an assumption that the test samples can be represented by a homogeneous medium. Such averaging method ignores the fact that the <b>geomaterial</b> samples are also consisted of a number of materials and components whose properties may have significant differences. In the proposed approach, digital image processing methods are used as measurement tools to construct a digital representation for the actual spatial distribution of the different materials and components in <b>geomaterial</b> samples. The digital data are further processed to automatically generate meshes or grids for numerical analysis. These meshes or grids can be easily incorporated into existing numerical software packages for further mechanical analysis and failure prediction of the geomaterials under external loading. The paper presents case studies to illustrate the proposed approach. Further discussions are also made on how to use the proposed approach to develop the geomechanics by taking into account the <b>geomaterial</b> behavior at micro-scale, meso-scale and macro-scale levels. A literature review of the related developments is given by examining the SCI papers in the database of Science Citation Index Expanded.

The presented numerical formulation is capable of accurately modelling dilatant, pressure sensitive isotropic and anisotropic <b>geomaterials</b> subjected to large deformations. In particular, the formulation is capable of simulating the behaviour of <b>geomaterials</b> in which eigentriads of stress and strain do not coincide during the loading process. The algorithm is tested in conjunction with the novel hyperelasto}plastic model termed the B material model, which is a single surface (single yield surface, a$ne single ultimate surface and a$ne single potential surface) model for dilatant, pressure sensitive, hardening and softening <b>geomaterials.</b> It is speci"cally developed to model large deformation hyperelasto}plastic problems in geomechanics...|$|R
