5|$|The 1980s saw a {{rebirth of}} Wall Street, and Manhattan {{reclaimed}} its {{role at the}} center of the worldwide financial industry. The 1980s also saw Manhattan at the heart of the AIDS crisis, with Greenwich Village at its epicenter. The organizations Gay Men's <b>Health</b> <b>Crisis</b> (GMHC) and AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) were founded to advocate on behalf of those stricken with the disease.|$|E
5|$|After the conference, Campbell flew to New York with Callen, Berkowitz and Artie Felson, {{organizing}} {{and planning for}} local and national PWA organizations on the plane. On arrival, they organized a PWA organization in the city despite initial opposition from the Gay Men's <b>Health</b> <b>Crisis.</b> They also planned a national PWA organization which opened in New York City in June 1984. PWA-New York went on to create the first safer sex poster to appear in a gay bathhouse in the city.|$|E

40|$|Objective To use cluster {{analysis}} to determine profiles of adolescents {{at risk for}} HIV. Methods Adolescents 15 – 21 years old (N = 1153) {{with a history of}} unprotected sex were assessed in five domains of risk (unprotected sex, alcohol/marijuana use, other drug use, mental <b>health</b> <b>crises,</b> and arrest/school dropout) as well as demographic, contextual, and behavioral variables. Results Cluster analysis revealed separate three-cluster solutions for males and females. Among males, clusters were characterized by (a) mental <b>health</b> <b>crises</b> and unprotected sex, (b) alcohol/marijuana use and unprotected sex, and (c) lower risk. Among females, clusters were distinguished by (a) unprotected sex, (b) substance use and mental <b>health</b> <b>crises,</b> and (c) lower risk. Cluster membership was associated with secondary variables related to sexual risk. Conclusions Even within populations of high-risk adolescents, subgroups exist for which specific risk factors co-occur, particularly unprotected sex, mental <b>health</b> <b>crises,</b> and substance use. These patterns suggest that effective HIV prevention interventions may need to target the association between mental health and/or substance abuse with sexual risk for some adolescents.

25|$|On May 10, 1994, {{at the age}} of 30, McKagan became gravely ill due to acute alcohol-induced pancreatitis, {{which caused}} his {{pancreas}} to swell {{to the size of a}} football and leak digestive enzymes into his body.

He was told by his doctors that he would be dead within a month if he did not stop drinking. He had made previous efforts to curb his drinking, but this <b>health</b> <b>crisis</b> was his incentive to become sober for good. In his autobiography, he attributed his sobriety to exercise through first mountain biking, and later martial arts.|$|E

25|$|In the U.S., {{the federal}} {{government}} does not guarantee universal healthcare to all its citizens, but publicly funded healthcare programs help to provide for the elderly, disabled, the poor, and children. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act or EMTALA also ensures public access to emergency services. The EMTALA law forces emergency healthcare providers to stabilize an emergency <b>health</b> <b>crisis</b> and cannot withhold treatment for lack of evidence of insurance coverage or other evidence of the ability to pay. EMTALA does not absolve the person receiving emergency care of the obligation to meet the cost of emergency healthcare not paid for at the time and it is still within the right of the hospital to pursue any debtor for the cost of emergency care provided. In Canada, emergency room treatment for legal Canadian residents is not charged to the patient at time of service but is met by the government.|$|E

25|$|Near the war's end, Powell was {{stationed}} in Paris, where he played with Django Reinhardt, and then returned for a brief stint in Goodman's band again after being discharged from the military. It was around this time, the mid-to-late 1940s, that Powell moved to Hollywood and ventured into providing music for movies and cartoons—notably Tom and Jerry. In 1948 he played himself in the movie A Song Is Born, appearing {{along with many other}} famous jazz players, including Louis Armstrong. It was during his time in Hollywood that he met and married actress Martha Scott. Mel Powell had a major <b>health</b> <b>crisis</b> in the late 1940s when he developed muscular dystrophy. Confined to a wheelchair for some time, then walking with aid of a cane, the illness effectively ended his ability to work as a traveling musician again with Goodman or other bands, and prompted Powell to devote himself to music composition rather than performance. From 1948 to 1952 he studied at Yale University with German composer and music theorist Paul Hindemith. In 1954 he recorded the jazz album Thigamigig, including a piano/trumpet/drums track that was selected by Art Clokey for his claymation short Gumbasia in 1955.|$|E
