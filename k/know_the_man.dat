25|$|Courtship and {{relationships}} in the Philippines are conservative in nature. The man will have to court the woman and prove his love for her before he can win her heart. Sometimes the courtship period would last for years; this however, is a very old fashioned idea. In the bigger more urbanized cities, this conservative courtship idea is not so emphasized as much. Parents prefer their daughter to be courted in theirhome, so {{they can have a}} chance to <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>man.</b> It is during the courtship period that the man would put his best foot forward to create a good impression on the woman and her family. Generally, the man is being measured on his being a gentleman, ability to respect the woman's family, and servitude (the extent of what he was willing to do to prove his love for the woman). Usually, the woman is courted by several men and will have to choose the best from among her suitors. Courtship {{and relationships}} remain the same for rural and urban areas despite the modern western influence.|$|E
500|$|Before the film's US {{television}} debut, Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times {{was critical}} of the film's objectives: [...] "he trouble with The Girl is that it tries to psychoanalyze Hitchcock but fails by trying to <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> too much. It's a movie about Hitchcock that ignores his best advice: 'Suspense is like a woman. The more left to the imagination, the more the excitement. Richard Brody of The New Yorker also gave the film a negative review, writing that, {{instead of being a}} drama, the film is an unoriginal work of criticism which [...] "points to what everyone ought already to have been talking about in the first place: not least, that it's no surprise to learn that a filmmaker whose art is devoted to pain, fear, control, and sexual obsession also experienced and inflicted them in life". On the day of its UK premiere, James Rampton of The Independent wrote that The Girl was [...] "no mere black-and-white hatchet job on Hitch. It does not seek to portray him as an unambiguous monster; rather, it highlights the profound psychological damage that plagued the director throughout his life". The Guardians Deborah Orr was generally positive about the film: [...] "here was only one thing wrong with The Girl. There was no Hitchcock in the director's chair to make it the utterly compelling psychological drama that it could have been." ...|$|E
