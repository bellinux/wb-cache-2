No behavioural signs of distress were observed during the early part of the induction. The swine exhibited muscular activity from 13 - 30 s after induction-start as well as during awakening from anaesthesia, possibly because of a transitory weaker suppression of the brain stem than of the cortex.

40|$|A {{computer-assisted}} {{method of}} indexing and retrieving documents {{from a personal}} collection is described. The sys-tem allows input of author, title, bibliographic details and keywords. Documents are allocated a numeric code and stored sequentially. Three types of output are provided: an alphabetic keywords list with document reference numbers (including an author index), a reference list of document titles, bibliographic details and authors, and the output from searches upon the system. Use of the system can be by manual consultation of the indexes or by computer search using the Boolean operators AND or OR. Keywords are selected by the researcher/collection owner and can be up to 36 characters in length. This allows both for unusually long keywords and for pre-coordination of key-words, which in turn permits {{a high degree of}} specificity in the vocabulary if this is considered desirable. A facility is also included to allow for the allocation of subject categories to the documents in the collection. The collection is stored in box files and is added to sequentially.

HELIOS represents a significant breakthrough technology that has the potential to transform the work of archivists by helping them to overcome the significant challenges they face, including an inability to: 1. create good finding aids and indexes for paper archives that provide deep access to collections, 2. provide effective retrieval from paper archives due to the inherent diversity and size of these one-of-a-kind files, and 3. offer broad public access to archives because they represent resources that the researcher must visit in order to use effectively.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Intensive {{care unit}} (ICU) {{patients}} {{are known to}} experience severely disturbed sleep, with possible detrimental effects on short- and long- term outcomes. Investigation into the exact causes and effects of disturbed sleep has been hampered by cumbersome and time consuming methods of measuring and staging sleep. We introduce a novel method for ICU <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> sleep analysis, the ICU <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> sleep <b>index</b> (IDOS index), using single channel electroencephalography (EEG) {{and apply it to}} outpatient recordings. A proof of concept is shown in non-sedated ICU patients. METHODS: Polysomnographic (PSG) recordings of five ICU patients and 15 healthy outpatients were analyzed using the IDOS index, based on the ratio between gamma and delta band power. Manual selection of thresholds was used to classify data as either wake, sleep or slow wave sleep (SWS). This classification was compared to visual sleep scoring by Rechtschaffen & Kales criteria in normal outpatient recordings and ICU recordings to illustrate face validity <b>of</b> the IDOS <b>index.</b> RESULTS: When reduced to two or three classes, the scoring of sleep by IDOS index and manual scoring show high agreement for normal sleep recordings. The obtained overall agreements, as quantified by the kappa coefficient, were 0. 84 for sleep/wake classification and 0. 82 for classification into three classes (wake, non-SWS and SWS). Sensitivity and specificity were highest for the wake state (93 % and 93 %, respectively) and lowest for SWS (82 % and 76 %, respectively). For ICU recordings, agreement was similar to agreement between visual scorers previously reported in literature. CONCLUSIONS: Besides the most satisfying visual resemblance with manually scored normal PSG recordings, the established face-validity <b>of</b> the IDOS <b>index</b> as an estimator <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> sleep was excellent.

With these issues in mind, we in-troduce the concept of spatial order sequences and propose a fast and compact index structure for moving objects by utilizing spa-tial order sequences through a number of density-conscious opti-mizations. First, we propose the concept of Ordered-Cell Group (OCG) and design a OCG based grid index structure. Second, we speed up the search efficiency of OCGs by effective compaction of identifiers of OCG cells to maximize the fan-out <b>of</b> <b>index</b> node and decrease the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>index.</b> Finally, we develop an efficient query processing algorithm that can effectively utilize OCG cells to speed up the processing of spatial queries. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to existing index techniques. 1...|$|R
40|$|Interpretation of {{resistivity}} {{cross sections}} {{may be in}} many cases unreliable due {{to the presence of}} artifacts left by the inversion process. One way to avoid erroneous conclusions about geological structure is creation <b>of</b> <b>Depth</b> <b>of</b> Investigation (DOI) <b>index</b> maps, which describe durability of prepared model with respect to variable parameters of inversion. To assess the usefulness of this interpretation methodology in resistivity imaging method over quaternary sediments, it has been used to one synthetic data set and three investigation sites. Two of the study areas were placed in the Upper Silesian Industrial District region: Bytom - Karb, Chorzów - Chorzow Stary; and one in the Southern Pomeranian Lake District across Piława River Valley. Basing on the available geological information the results show high utility <b>of</b> DOI <b>index</b> in analysis <b>of</b> received resistivity models, on which areas poorly constrained by data has been designated...|$|R
