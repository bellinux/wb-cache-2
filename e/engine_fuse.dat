40|$|Given the {{proliferation}} of geo-tagged images, {{the question of how}} to exploit geo tags and the underlying geo context for visual search is emerging. Based on the observation that the importance of geo context varies over concepts, we propose a concept-based image search <b>engine</b> which <b>fuses</b> visual concept detection and geo context in a concept-dependent manner. Compared to individual content-based and geo-based concept detectors and their uniform combination, conceptdependent fusion shows improvements. Moreover, since the proposed search engine is trained on social-tagged images alone without the need of human interaction, it is flexible to cope with many concepts. Search experiments on 101 popular visual concepts justify the viability of the proposed solution. In particular, for 79 out of the 101 concepts, the learned weights yield improvements over the uniform weights, with a relative gain of at least 5 % in terms of average precision...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} a soft computing approach of fusion of signals from different independent sources. The signals may be from {{different types of}} primary classifiers. The Dempster Shafer Evidence Accumulation (DSEA) theory provides a robust platform for evidence fusion and it incorporates uncertainty, imprecision and conflicting situations {{in the process of}} decision making into a mathematical framework. Primarily, Neuro-Fuzzy classifiers have been used on the signals of each individual source to classify them into meaningful clusters and to assign mass value to each cluster, then Dempster Shafer Evidence Accumulation engine (DSEAE) has been used to combine them for final output with proper classification to different admissible clusters. We have cited two experimental results of the use of this concept.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is the {{definition}} of a complete framework for texture-based annotation and retrieval. This framework is centred on the concept of "texture codes", so called because they encode the relative energy levels of Gabor filter responses. These codes are pixel-based, robust descriptors with respect to illumination variations, can be generated efficiently, and included in a fast retrieval process. They can act as local or global descriptors, and can be used in the representations of regions or objects. Our framework is therefore capable of supporting a wide range of queries and applications. During our research, {{we have been able to}} utilise results of psychological studies on the perception of similarity and have explored non-metric similarity scores. As a result, we have found that similarity can be evaluated with simple measures predominantly relying on the information extracted from the query, without a drastic loss in retrieval performance. We have been able to show that the most simple measure possible, counting the number of common codes between the query and a stored image, can for some algorithmic parameters outperform well-proven benchmarks. Importantly also, our measures can all support partial comparisons, so that region-based queries can be answered without the need for segmentation. We have investigated refinements of the framework which endow it with the ability to localise queries in candidate images, and to deal with user relevance feedback. The final framework can generate good and fast retrieval results as demonstrated with a databases of 3723 images, and can therefore be useful as a stand-alone system. The framework has also been applied to the problem of high-level annotation. In particular, it has been used as a cue detector, where a cue is a visual example of a particular concept such as a type of sport. The detection results show that the system can predict the correct cue among a small set of cues, and can therefore provide useful information to an <b>engine</b> <b>fusing</b> the outputs of several cue detectors. So an important aspect of this framework is that it is expected to be an asset within a multi-cue annotation and/or retrieval system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} fully {{automatic}} face recognition algorithm and demonstrate its {{performance on the}} FRGC v 2. 0 data. Our algorithm is multimodal (2 D and 3 D) and performs hybrid (feature based and holistic) matching {{in order to achieve}} efficiency and robustness to facial expressions. The pose of a 3 D face along with its texture is automatically corrected using a novel approach based on a single automatically detected point and the Hotelling transform. A novel 3 D Spherical Face Representation (SFR) is used in conjunction with the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) descriptor to form a rejection classifier, which quickly eliminates a large number of candidate faces at an early stage for efficient recognition in case of large galleries. The remaining faces are then verified using a novel region-based matching approach, which is robust to facial expressions. This approach automatically segments the eyesforehead and the nose regions, which are relatively less sensitive to expressions and matches them separately using a modified Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm. The results of all the matching <b>engines</b> are <b>fused</b> at the metric level to achieve higher accuracy. We use the FRGC benchmark to compare our results to other algorithms that used the same database. Our multimodal hybrid algorithm performed better than others by achieving 99. 74 percent and 98. 31 percent verification rates at a 0. 001 false acceptance rate (FAR) and identification rates of 99. 02 percent and 95. 37 percent for probes with a neutral and a nonneutral expression, respectively.

The Safety Board pieced together a probable sequence of events for the loss of engine three:#Gradual failure by fatigue and then overload failure of the inboard mid-spar fuse pin at the inboard thin-walled location.#Overload failure of the outer lug of the inboard mid-spar pylon fitting.#Overload failure of the outboard mid-spar fuse pin at the outboard thin-walled and fatigue-cracked location.#Overload failure of the outboard mid-spar fuse pin at the inboard thin-walled location.|$|R
40|$|Smart grid {{expectations}} objectify {{the need}} for optimizing power distribution systems greater than ever. Distribution Automation (DA) {{is an integral part}} of the SG solution; however, disregarding human factors in the DA systems can make it more problematic than beneficial. As a consequence, Human-Automation Interaction (HAI) theories can be employed to optimize the DA systems in a human-centered manner. Earlier we introduced a novel framework for the realization of Adaptive Autonomy (AA) concept in the power distribution network using expert systems. This research presents a hybrid expert system for the realization of AA, using both Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Logistic Regression (LR) models, referred to as AAHES, respectively. AAHES uses neural networks and logistic regression as an expert system inference <b>engine.</b> This system <b>fuses</b> LR and ANN models' outputs which will results in a progress, comparing to both individual models. The practical list of environmental conditions and superior experts' judgments are used as the expert systems database. Since training samples will affect the expert systems performance, the AAHES is implemented using six different training sets. Finally, the results are interpreted in order to find the best training set. As revealed by the results, the presented AAHES can effectively determine the proper level of automation for changing the performance shaping factors of the HAI systems in the smart grid environment...|$|R

After finishing 3rd in the opening round of the ATCC at Sandown behind winner Brock and second placed Dick Johnson (Johnson had taken Moffat's 1970's mantle of being the leading Ford driver in the country), he claimed pole in his RX-7 (fitted with the 13B rotary engine instead of the 12A of 1983) at Symmons Plains. However, due to the cold conditions the team put a cover over {{the front of the car}} to help warm up the <b>engine.</b> Unfortunately the <b>fuse</b> for the overheating warning light had blown and Moffat's race only lasted until the hairpin on lap one before his rotary engine expired, handing an easy win to Brock. He then won at Wannerroo in Perth, before crashing out of the championship at Surfers Paradise when his Mazda was hit while lapping the XD Falcon of Gary Willmington at high speed going under the Dunlop Bridge at the end of the main straight. Due to the wet conditions the Mazda slid off the road at high speed, took out an ABC television camera cable and slammed head on into a bush that was hiding a tree stump.

40|$|A {{proposed}} data-fusion system, to {{be implemented}} mostly in software, would further process the digitized and preprocessed outputs of sensors in a turbofan engine to detect foreign-object damage (FOD) [more precisely, damage caused by impingement of such foreign objects as birds, pieces of ice, and runway debris]. The proposed system could help a flight crew to decide what, if any, response is necessary to complete a flight safely, and could aid mechanics in deciding what post-flight maintenance action might be needed. The sensory information to be utilized by the proposed system would consist of (1) the output of an accelerometer in an engine-vibration-monitoring subsystem and (2) features extracted from a gas path analysis. ["Gas path analysis" (GPA) is a term of art that denotes comprehensive analysis of engine performance derived from readings of fuel-flow meters, shaft-speed sensors, temperature sensors, and the like. ] The acceleration signal would first be processed by a wavelet-transform-based algorithm, using a wavelet created for the specific purpose of finding abrupt FOD-induced changes in noisy accelerometer signals. Two additional features extracted would be the amplitude of vibration (determined via a single- frequency Fourier transform calculated at the rotational speed of the engine), {{and the rate of}} change in amplitude due to an FOD-induced rotor imbalance. This system would utilize two GPA features: the fan efficiency and the rate of change of fan efficiency with time. The selected GPA and vibrational features would be assessed by two fuzzy-logic inference engines, denoted the "Gas Path Expert" and the "Vibration Expert," respectively (see Figure 1). Each of these inference engines would generate a "possibility" distribution for occurrence of an FOD event: Each inference engine would assign, to its input information, degrees of membership, which would subsequently be transformed into basic probability assignments for the gas path and vibration components. The outputs of the inference <b>engines</b> would be <b>fused</b> by use of Dempster s combination algorithm (more precisely, an algorithm, based on the Dempster-Shafer-Yager theory of evidence, for fusing uncertain or imprecise information) to provide a reduced body of information to a human or computer decision maker.
