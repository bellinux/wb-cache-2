[...] However Marko Djordjevic of GameFocus disagreed and stated, [...] "once you get the <b>hang</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> [...] it feels exactly as you’d expect." [...] Djordjevic further appreciated that the cooperative gameplay was ported over from the console versions.|$|E

She has tall bunny-ears and has on a blue and golden waist coat with a golden clock that <b>hangs</b> off <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Underneath she wears a type of white women's leotard and grey tights, paired with red flats. Usa-tan is a princess-type and doesn't care if the spotlight is on her or not. She also seems to have a daring side, standing up on top of Takeru's luggage with no care at all. Although this, she prefers to act and talk like a lady and is quite the genius when it comes to business. She has her own Production company. She apparently likes developing the character of the Eto-Shin. She loses to the Cat in episode 4 and gives up her seal. She works in the Maid Café like the others. As seen in episode 4, she is shown on a white board in Takeru's house as one of the 4 against the Cat joining the Zodiac.|$|R
