60|$|She {{stood with}} <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>shut,</b> seeing the divan in the music-room and the girl's arm shivering. Then, {{going to the}} piano, she began with all her might to play a Chopin polonaise.|$|E
60|$|And he {{sat by the}} bedside, slowly, rhythmically {{stroking}} her brows with his finger-tips, stroking <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>shut,</b> soothing her, holding her fingers in his free hand. They could hear the sleepers' breathing in the other rooms.|$|E
6000|$|... "Fust {{thing to}} do," [...] ses Mrs. Prince, still with <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>shut,</b> [...] "you {{go up to}} the Cauliflower to-night; the six men’ll all be there, and you must buy six ha’pennies off of them; one each." ...|$|E
60|$|With <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> tightly <b>shut,</b> lest {{she should}} see {{something}} hideous in the woods, she stumbled on, holding to her friend's arm.|$|R
60|$|Conscience was {{beginning}} to rise up against her, and that hydra-headed tyrant Remorse. She closed <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> to <b>shut</b> out the hideous vision of her crime; she tried to forget this home which her treachery had desecrated.|$|R
60|$|The Irishman obeyed. He stooped {{and lifted}} her in his arms. She had been lying {{in a state of}} semi-insensibility with <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> tightly <b>shut.</b> The moment she felt herself being lifted, she {{clutched}} her protector by the hair, and held on, shrieking.|$|R
60|$|With <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>shut,</b> {{she already}} beheld Jane Beckett meeting her, when {{seated at the}} back of a carriage, with a veil and a parasol, {{addressing}} her as a grand lady, and kissing and praising her when she found her little Charlotte after all.|$|E
6000|$|Milly kept <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>shut</b> {{for some}} time after the {{children}} were gone. Amos had sunk on his knees, and was holding her hand while he watched her face. By-and-by she opened her eyes, and, drawing him close to her, whispered slowly,--'My dear--dear--husband--you have been--very--good to me. You--have--made me--very--happy.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Fanny took a {{good deal}} of time: lying back with <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>shut,</b> and her eyebrows raised with a hopeless {{expression}} as if she had utterly given up all terrestrial affairs. At length, without the slightest notice, she opened her eyes again, and recommenced in a short, sharp manner: ...|$|E
60|$|Now {{the lion}} was {{crouching}} {{for the spring}} that would end their young lives beneath cruel, rending, yellow fangs. Jane Porter sank to her knees in prayer, closing <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> to <b>shut</b> out the last hideous instant. Thuran, weak from fever, fainted.|$|R
6000|$|When, finally, {{he came to}} {{the place}} where the lady was lying on the settee, he stood there a moment holding the bowl in his hand, without speaking, as he thought the lady was asleep; for <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> were <b>shut.</b> In a moment, however, she opened <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> Rollo then said to her,-- ...|$|R
60|$|She {{still looked}} at him and smiled, but soon a slight look of fatigue or perplexity came into <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and she <b>shut</b> them again.|$|R
60|$|Rachel obeyed, and Noie sat by her, {{holding her}} hand, till {{presently}} <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>shut</b> and she slept. But Noie did not sleep. All {{that night she}} sat there watching and listening, till at length the dawn came and she lay down also by the door and rested.|$|E
6000|$|MURRAY (offended). What do {{you mean}} by everything? You said that so strangely. You mean you don't believe---- (But she remains silent with <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>shut.</b> He frowns and takes to pacing up and down beside the bed.) Why have they got you stuck out here on this {{isolation}} porch, Eileen? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Grierson, {{indicating}} the remnants {{on the table}} with contempt. [...] "She would do better than this with <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>shut!</b> Then," [...] he continued eagerly, [...] "she can wash and mend clothes. I've noticed that you and Mr. West throw half your things away long before you need to." ...|$|E
60|$|The Comtesse looked {{round at}} the quaint, old-fashioned English inn, {{the peace of}} this land of civil and {{religious}} liberty, and she closed <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> to <b>shut</b> out the haunting vision of that West Barricade, and of the mob retreating panic-stricken when the old hag spoke of the plague.|$|R
60|$|Jill awoke with a start. She opened <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and <b>shut</b> {{them again}} at once. The sun {{was very strong}} now. It {{was one of those}} prematurely warm days of early Spring which have all the languorous heat of late summer. She opened <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> once more, and found that she was feeling greatly refreshed. She also {{discovered}} that her head was resting on Wally's shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|PADDY--[With heavy, biting sarcasm.] 'Twas love {{at first}} sight, divil a doubt of it! If you'd seen the endearin' look on her pale mug when she shrivelled away with her hands over <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> to <b>shut</b> out the sight of him! Sure, 'twas as if she'd seen a great hairy ape escaped from the Zoo! ...|$|R
60|$|He kissed her, kissed <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>shut,</b> so {{that she}} could not look any more. He wanted {{something}} now, some recognition, some sign, some admission. But she only lay silent and child-like and remote, like a child that is overcome and cannot understand, only feels lost. He kissed her again, giving up.|$|E
6000|$|... "A Swedish servant-girl," [...] {{answered}} Simeon, loudly, addressing {{every one}} in the room. [...] "She couldn't write her name; but when the spirit of Raphael controlled her she could do this with <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>shut.</b> There's nothing like that picture in the world. It cannot be duplicated by any artist in the flesh." ...|$|E
6000|$|She sat upright, {{her hands}} clasped in her lap, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>shut,</b> trying to collect her thoughts; {{and the silence}} lasted for several seconds. At last she said, opening her eyes, but gazing {{straight}} before her, not at him, 'I do not think I ought. Do you really {{know what you are}} saying? You know I cannot get well.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "See," [...] {{he cried}} to Juanna, who all this while had {{sat with her}} hand before <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> to <b>shut</b> out {{the vision of the}} dwarf's dreadful progress, [...] "he has crossed safely!" [...] and he pointed to a figure that {{appeared}} to be dancing with glee upon the breast of the snow slope.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{what is the}} reason, in Heaven's name," [...] {{answered}} the matron, keeping <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> firmly <b>shut,</b> and still shrewish in her expostulation, though in the very extremity of terror, [...] "what {{is the reason that}} you should come and frighten a decent house, where you met naething, when ye was in the body, but the height of civility?" ...|$|R
60|$|Her head ached intolerably: {{that was}} the first {{conscious}} sensation which came to her; then she vaguely perceived a pale ray of sunshine, very hazy and narrow, which came from somewhere {{in front of her and}} struck her in the face. She kept <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> tightly <b>shut,</b> for that filmy light caused her an increase of pain.|$|R
60|$|When Mrs Flintwinch dreamed, {{she usually}} dreamed, unlike {{the son of}} her old {{mistress}}, with <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>shut.</b> She had a curiously vivid dream that night, and before {{she had left the}} son of her old mistress many hours. In fact it was not at all like a dream; it was so very real in every respect. It happened in this wise.|$|E
6000|$|She {{tried to}} rid herself of the ache at her heart by {{thinking}} of Wales. She closed her eyes, {{and found that}} that helped her to remember. With <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>shut,</b> she could bring it all back--that rainy day, the graceful, supple figure {{that had come to}} her out of the mist, those walks over the hills [...] . If only Geoffrey would come! It was the sight of him that she needed.|$|E
60|$|Engaged! But was she? Grizel laughed. It is {{not usually}} a {{laughing}} matter, {{but she could not}} help that. Consider her predicament. She could be engaged at once, if she liked, even before she wiped the water from her face, or she might postpone it, to let Tommy share. The careful reader will have noticed that this problem presented itself to her at an awkward moment. She laughed, in short, while her face was still in the basin, with the very proper result that she had to grope for the towel with <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>shut.</b>|$|E
60|$|At {{times there}} is a suddenness {{in the manner of}} Mademoiselle Hortense so like a bodily spring upon the subject of it that such subject involuntarily starts and fails back. It is Mr. Tulkinghorn's case at present, though Mademoiselle Hortense, with <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> almost <b>shut</b> up (but still looking out sideways), is only smiling contemptuously and shaking her head.|$|R
30|$|This is {{followed}} by the low pitch tone group; the vlogger is winding down. Following this there is a suspension of both language and paralanguage as <b>her</b> the vlogger’s <b>eyes</b> <b>shut</b> and <b>her</b> head slumps forward (Fig.  36).|$|R
6000|$|... "'Hell {{of a way}} to stop a locomotive,' I complained at Seth, as I {{climbed down}} on to the right of way. I walked past our engine and up to the girl, and what do you think? <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> were <b>shut</b> tight. She was {{trembling}} that violent that you would see it by the moonlight. And she was barefoot, too.|$|R
60|$|By degrees the sobs subsided, {{she began}} to breathe calmly, and lay quiet with <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>shut.</b> Patiently Maynard sat, not heeding the flight of the hours, not heeding the old clock that ticked loudly on the landing. But when it was nearly ten, Dorcas, impatiently anxious to know the result of Mr. Gilfil's appearance, could not help {{stepping}} in on tip-toe. Without moving, he {{whispered in her ear}} to supply him with candles, see that the cow-boy had shaken down his mare, and go to bed--he would watch with Caterina--a great change had come over her.|$|E
60|$|It was {{approaching}} {{the afternoon of}} a very sultry day when Lawrence awoke from his midday siesta under an algaroba-tree, and slowly opened his eyes. The first object they rested upon was the brown little face of Manuela, reposing on a pillow formed of leopard skin. In those regions it was the practice, when convenient, to sling a network hammock between two trees, and enjoy one's siesta in that. The Indian girl lay in her hammock, with <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>shut,</b> and her little mouth open,--not undignifiedly open, but just sufficiently so to permit of one seeing something of the teeth and tongue inside.|$|E
6000|$|What Polly thought of, as she {{lay back}} in her chair, with <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>shut,</b> and a hopeless look on her face, is none of our business, though we might feel a wish to know what caused a tear to gather slowly {{from time to time}} under her lashes, and roll down on Puttel's Quaker-colored coat. Was it regret for the conquest she relinquished, was it sympathy for her friend, or was it an {{uncontrollable}} overflow of feeling as she read some sad or tender passage of the little romance which she kept hidden away in her own heart? ...|$|E
60|$|Some one knocked gently at her door. She did not answer, she feigned sleep. Yet {{the door}} opened, she felt, though <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> were <b>shut</b> and <b>her</b> back turned, {{that there was}} a light in the room. A tender step {{approached}} her bed. It could be but one person, that person whom she had herself deceived. She knew it was her father.|$|R
60|$|Old Granny Fox saw the gun of Farmer Brown's boy pointed {{right at}} Reddy and she clapped both hands over <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> to <b>shut</b> out the dreadful sight. Then {{she waited for}} the bang of the gun. It didn't come. Then Granny peeped through her fingers. Farmer Brown's boy was still there, but Reddy Fox had {{disappeared}} inside the house.|$|R
5000|$|In the Sleep of Reason by Mark Wallinger - a video piece {{taken from}} Thatcher's 1982 Falklands speech and edited to show only each blink, thus giving the {{appearance}} that <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> are constantly <b>shut.</b>|$|R
