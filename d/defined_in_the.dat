5|$|Nike-X {{had been}} <b>defined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1960s {{as a system}} to defend US cities and {{industrial}} centers against a heavy Soviet attack during the 1970s. By 1965 the growing fleets of ICBMs in the inventories of both the US and USSR were making the cost of such a system very expensive. NIE 11-8-63, published 18 October 1963, estimated the Soviets would have 400–700 ICBMs deployed by 1969, and their deployment eventually reached 1,601 launchers, limited by the SALT agreements.|$|E

The ISQ defines the quantities that are measured with the SI units.

5|$|The {{effective}} {{tax rate}} for any household would be variable due to the fixed monthly tax rebate {{that are used to}} rebate taxes paid on purchases up to the poverty level.

These five works on the ballot are the five most-nominated by members that year, with no limit on the number of works that can be nominated. The 1953 through 1956 and 1958 awards did not include any recognition of runner-up magazines, but since 1959 all five candidates were recorded. Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of five nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held. Worldcons are generally held near the start of September, and are held in a different city around the world each year.|$|E

5|$|In {{conjunction}} with the National Geographic Database, the National Register of Electors is used to create preliminary voters lists for each electoral district in Canada for each election, byelection, and referendum. Each candidate from each electoral district is given a voters list for that district, which is {{a subset of the}} data in the National Register of Electors whose addresses are within the boundaries of the district as <b>defined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> National Geographic Database. That data may only be used for election purposes; any other use of that data subjects the user to penalties including fines, imprisonment, or both. The voter lists are updated by returning officers based on information received during an election campaign, ultimately resulting in final voters lists being distributed by election day.|$|E
5|$|MSE {{provides}} real-time protection, constantly monitoring {{activities on}} the computer and scanning new files as they are downloaded or created.

Depending on those settings, it may also create System Restore checkpoints before removing the detected malware. As a part of real-time protection, by default, MSE reports all suspicious behaviors of monitored programs to Microsoft Active Protection Service (MAPS, originally Microsoft SpyNet), a web-based service. If the report matches a newly discovered malware threat with an unreleased virus definition, the new definition is downloaded to remove the threat.|$|E
