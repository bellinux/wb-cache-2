It is important to examine the biological, behavioral and social mechanisms to improve outcomes for depressed cardiac patients. A number of plausible biobehavioral mechanisms linking depression and cardiovascular disease have been identified. Tricyclic antidepressants have various effects on the cardiovascular system, while selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are not associated with adverse cardiac effects and should, therefore, be the preferred choice for the treatment of most patients with comorbid depression and cardiovascular disease. © 2009 <b>Expert</b> Reviews <b>Ltd...</b>|$|R

CNV is a multifactorial condition whose pathogenesis involves inflammation, angiogenesis and fibrosis. All available monotherapies are directed specifically to only one part of the CNV process. Combination therapy may act simultaneously on different pathways in the pathogenesis of CNV, resulting in additive or synergistic effects that may help to achieve good treatment outcome with few treatments needed. Large controlled studies are needed to achieve the best combination therapy for CNV. © 2010 <b>Expert</b> Reviews <b>Ltd...</b>|$|R

40|$|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can be {{considered}} the most promising biosample for the discovery and analysis of biomarkers in neuroscience, an area of great medical need. CSF is a body fluid that surrounds the brain and provides a rich pool of biochemical markers, both proteomic and metabolomic, that reflect the state of neurological processes. Such biomarkers can either serve as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers to improve the characterization of patients and preclinical disease models, or {{can be used to}} demonstrate drug-related exposure and efficacy. Here, we describe the proteomic toolbox for studying CSF from a drug-discovery perspective, and the trends and challenges that lie ahead. © 2012 <b>Expert</b> Reviews <b>Ltd...</b>|$|R

40|$|Incretin-based therapies {{represent}} {{a new and}} innovative treatment modality {{in the management of}} Type 2 diabetes. Their therapeutic actions address many of the key metabolic defects in the pathophysiology of diabetes. Incretin hormones augment insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. They have a low risk of inducing hypoglycemia, unlike many other antidiabetic medications. They also have the beneficial effect of being associated with early satiety, decreased caloric intake and weight loss. Exenatide was the first incretin-based therapy to be licensed for use and has now been developed in a once-weekly preparation. We review the evidence base for the use of exenatide and discuss the implications for the management of diabetes. © 2012 <b>Expert</b> Reviews <b>Ltd...</b>|$|R

40|$|Chronic {{neurological}} diseases (CND) like {{amyotrophic lateral sclerosis}} (ALS), dementia {{or multiple}} sclerosis (MS) share a chronic progressive course of disease that frequently leads to the common pathological pathway of neurodegeneration, including neuroaxonal damage, apoptosis and gliosis. There is an ongoing search for biomarkers that could support early diagnosis of CND and help to identify responders to interventions in therapeutic treatment trials. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a promising source of biomarkers in CND, since the CSF compartment is in close anatomical contact with the brain interstitial fluid, where biochemical changes related to CND are reflected. We review recent advances in CSF biomarkers research in CND and thereby focus on markers associated with neurodegeneration. © 2008 <b>Expert</b> Reviews <b>Ltd...</b>|$|R
40|$|Angiotensin II {{receptor}} blockers (ARBs) {{inhibit the}} renin-angiotensin system. As a result, these agents provide beneficial effects {{in terms of}} cardiovascular (CV) and renal protection, independent of their blood pressure-lowering effects. Telmisartan and valsartan are the most intensively studied ARBs for the effects on CV outcomes. Randomized clinical trials assessing morbidity and mortality end points have included a range of patient types, including those with hypertension, hypertension with Type 2 diabetes, high CV risk without hypertension, ischemic heart disease, stroke and heart failure. Few head-to-head comparisons between telmisartan and valsartan have been performed. However, some blood pressure-independent properties of these two ARBs can be scrutinized from separate studies in the available literature. © 2012 <b>Expert</b> Reviews <b>Ltd...</b>|$|R
40|$|Ultrasound {{examination}} of the endometrium is {{the most commonly used}} noninvasive method to assess endometrial receptivity during IVF treatment. Endometrial thickness, pattern and volume are not predictive of pregnancy. A good blood supply towards the endometrium is usually considered to be an essential requirement for implantation and, therefore, assessment of endometrial blood flow within IVF treatment has drawn plenty of attention in recent years. Doppler study of uterine arteries does not reflect the actual blood flow to the endometrium. Endometrial and subendometrial blood flows can be more objectively and reliably measured with 3 D power Doppler ultrasound. However, conflicting results are reported with regard to their role in the prediction of pregnancy within IVF treatment. © 2008 <b>Expert</b> Reviews <b>Ltd.</b> link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Neuropathic pain (NP) is a pain arising as {{a direct}} {{consequence}} of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system. A variety of factors associated with the development of persistent NP have been suggested. The goal of the present article is to provide an overview of current knowledge about prognostic factors for persistent NP. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health model is used as a framework to categorize these predictors. Most reported predictors in the literature were found in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health-category of personal factors, especially age and psychological factors, functions and structure, including sensory signs and symptoms. Predictors in the category of environmental factors, activities and participation were less frequently described. © 2013 2013 <b>Expert</b> Reviews <b>Ltd...</b>|$|R
40|$|Memory {{problems}} are generally quite prominent in dementia {{and they have}} a significant impact on everyday functioning. Medication developed for Alzheimer's disease, for example, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, can slow down the increase of cognitive impairment for a while. In addition to pharmacotherapy, psychosocial treatment methods are also used, some of which have a positive effect on cognition, for example, cognitive rehabilitation, cognitive stimulation therapy and movement therapy. However, more research is needed. This article first describes the consequences of memory problems on the everyday life of people with dementia and summarizes research findings on how people with dementia experience and cope with their illness. We then discuss the most frequently applied psychosocial treatments for cognitive problems in dementia. © 2011 <b>Expert</b> Reviews <b>Ltd...</b>|$|R

With {{the advent of}} the targeted therapy era, molecular biomarkers in particular are becoming increasingly important within both clinical research and clinical practice. This article focuses on biomarkers that anticipate the prognosis of individual patients ('prognostic' biomarkers) and on biomarkers that predict how individual patients will respond to specific treatments ('predictive' biomarkers, also called 'effect modifiers'). Specific Phase II and III clinical trial designs are discussed in detail for their ability to validate the biomarker and/or to establish the effect of an experimental therapy in patient populations defined by {{the presence or absence of}} the biomarker. Contemporary biomarker-based clinical trials in oncology are used as examples. © 2011 <b>Expert</b> Reviews <b>Ltd.</b> SCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{establish}} {{a model that}} estimates a preference-based measure (valuation) of social participation for children between 8 and 18 years of age from the Handicap Scale for Children (HSC), a validated questionnaire for children with a chronic illness. Methods: Vignettes of the HSC classification system were valued by {{a representative sample of}} 249 persons aged 18 years onwards. Linear and nominal scale (mixed-effects) models were used to analyze the valuations of the vignettes. Results: We established a model that performed better than a model that simply sums up the levels of each dimension. Conclusion: We obtained a measure {{that can be used for}} assessing need, for quality assurance and for evaluating interventions on a group level aiming to increase social participation in children with chronic illnesses. © 2008 <b>Expert</b> Reviews <b>Ltd...</b>|$|R

40|$|Human papillomaviruses are the {{etiological}} {{agents of}} cervical cancer, {{one of the}} two most prevalent cancers in women in developing countries. Currently available prophylactic vaccines are based on the L 1 major capsid protein, which forms virus-like particles when expressed in yeast and insect cell lines. Despite their recognized efficacy, there are significant shortcomings: the vaccines are expensive, include only two oncogenic virus types, are delivered via intramuscular injection and require a cold chain. Plant expression systems may provide ways of overcoming some of these problems, in particular the expense. In this article, we report recent promising advances in the production of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines against human papillomavirus by expression of the relevant antigens in plants, and discuss future prospects for the use of such vaccines. © 2010 <b>Expert</b> Reviews <b>Ltd...</b>|$|R
40|$|Hypothyroxinemia {{with low}} levels of {{circulating}} free thyroxine and normal levels of thyrotropin, which is usually caused by iodine deficiency, may affect pregnant women even in apparently iodine-sufficient areas, and it is debated whether it increases the risk of neurodevelopmental abnormalities in children born to them. Epidemiological observations indeed indicate that this is the case. Animal models show abnormal brain cortical cytoarchitecture in pups born to mildly hypothyroxinemic dams. In regions where the availability and use of iodized salt is inadequate (where < 90 % of households use iodized salt), the WHO and the International Council for Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders (ICCIDD) recommend iodine supplementation so that the total iodine intake is 250 g/day to prevent iodine deficiency during gestation and lactation. © 2010 <b>Expert</b> Reviews <b>Ltd.</b> Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{birth of}} babies with {{homozygous}} α-thalassemia {{can be prevented}} by prenatal screening and diagnosis. Serial ultrasound examination of fetal cardio-thoracic ratio and placental thickness can exclude an affected pregnancy and, thus, {{reduce the need for}} an invasive test. Whether middle cerebral artery Doppler is useful in the prediction is not clear. 3 D ultrasound examination, maternal blood-smear screening for fetal hemoglobin Barts cells and maternal serum markers for Down syndrome have also been investigated. In view of the recent data on the survival of affected fetuses after in utero transfusion, it is arguable whether the latter should be offered as an alternative to termination of pregnancy after prenatal diagnosis. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis is possible, particularly for couples with repeatedly affected pregnancies. © 2009 <b>Expert</b> Reviews <b>Ltd.</b> link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Several {{interesting}} concepts regarding Parkinson's disease {{were recently}} {{presented at the}} XVIII World Congress on Parkinson's disease. The theory of α-synuclein acting as a prion, resulting in the spread of Parkinson's disease, was presented and related to the Braak hypothesis of neuropathology of Parkinson's disease. Nonmotor symptomatology of Parkinson's disease was presented and also related to the above. Research was emphasized at the meeting, and novel compounds thought to slow the progression of the disease were mentioned. Clinical research methodology designed to best prove an agent as disease modifying, and the merits of clinical research, were debated. Finally, treatment strategies for early Parkinson's disease, as well as continuous dopamine stimulation, were presented. This article briefly discusses these concepts presented at this important meeting of the World Congress on Parkinson's disease. © 2010 <b>Expert</b> Reviews <b>Ltd...</b>|$|R
