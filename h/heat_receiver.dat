Stirling heat engines are being developed for electrical power generation use on manned and unmanned earth orbital and planetary missions.

This Phase 1 effort initiated a program to evaluate and demonstrate coatings, applied to nickel based Stirling engine heater head materials, that are practically 'insoluble' in sodium, potassium, and NaK. This program initiated a study of nickel aluminide as a coating and developed and demonstrated a heat pipe test vehicle {{that can be used to}} test candidate materials and coatings.
