Off the Northern Ireland coast, the convoy escorts broke off and Empire Simba and three other ships sailed into the Irish Sea.

At 1300 hrs on 1 March, a Heinkel He 111 bomber of Kampfgeschwader 27, Luftwaffe attacked the column, and had a near miss on Empire Simba. The force of the explosion shattered the main water <b>injection</b> <b>pipe</b> in the engine room, flooding her engine room and leaving the ship dead in the water. The German bomber, with smoke trailing from it after being hit by bullets from one of Empire Simbas two Hotchkiss Mark I machine guns, headed off for Ireland. There were no towing vessels immediately available for Empire Simba, so as darkness approached, Empire Simbas crew abandoned the ship for the escorting trawler. Taking the ship's two machine guns, the chronometer, and some personal belongings, the crew were landed at Milford Haven. Empire Simba was saved and towed into Birkenhead, where the officers rejoined with their erstwhile ship. During an overnight bombing raid on the night of 12/13 March, German bombers parachuted land mines on Birkenhead. One landed on Empire Simba and exploded, causing significant damage to the ship.|$|E

In this process all the dihydrate slurry from attack tank is converted into hemihydrate before filtration. Process conditions have been found such as to make possible phosphoric acid production directly from hemihydrate conversion tank. Based on pilot test results with more than 6 different phosphate rocks, with this process P 2 O 5 recovery gains of about 1, 5 % - 2 % were expected with respect to a dihydrate process. Slurry filterability is also improved by about 10 % - 20 % and P 2 O 5 content of the produced acid is increased by more than 6 % compared to a Dihydrate process. Based on such promising results Grupa Azoty and Prayon Technologies decided to join their forces to run two industrial tests in Grupa Azoty plants. One of the Dihydrate production plant was converted into DA-HF process by simple modifications, including piping modifications, pump addition, steam and sulphuric acid <b>injection</b> <b>pipes</b> installation. During the tests, Egyptian and Moroccan rocks were processed successfully. The joint project team showed that the process is stable, it can be stopped and started easily.

This corresponds to an impressive gain in efficiency of about 4 % P 2 O 5 compared to the dihydrate process. The results obtained being very promising, Grupa Azoty and Prayon Technologies have agreed to move forward studying the conversion of one Grupa Azoty production plant into this new recently patented technology.

40|$|Thesis, (M. S.) Geological Sciences. During middle Miocene {{extension}} in {{a region}} now occupied by the Anza-Borrego Desert State Park in California, the Fish Creek Mountains detached from the Vallecito Mountains creating an extensional basin between the two ranges. The detachment surface, now high {{on the slopes of}} the Vallecito Mountains, was a large zone of fractured rock. With the onset of Gulf of California rifting in latest Miocene time a large earthquake may have initiated the fall of some fractured rock thus creating the Split Mountain sturzstrom (SMS). The timing of the SMS, in latest Miocene, represents a significant change in the regional paleogeography. Shortly after its deposition the entire region became covered with seawater due to Gulf of California rifting. This resulted in the precipitation of the Fish Creek Gypsum which lies conformably on the SMS. Quaternary uplift has now exposed the SMS displaying features that may be unique to sturzstrom deposits. Visible in several canyons that dissect the proximal and distal SMS are powder <b>injection</b> <b>pipes,</b> sigmoidal rock flows, decapitated stones, and grooved boulders. The SMS occurred approximately 5. 7 million years ago along the northeast margin of the Fish Creek-Vallecito Basin. Paleo-transport indicators show the SMS traveled to the east-southeast indicating a source area to the west. Petrographic analyses of the powdered rock matrix and clasts give a duomictic composition dominated by a foliated biotite tonalite and granodiorite. These match petrographically with rocks collected from the Vallecito Mountain front suggesting the eastern mountain front was the source area. The SMS has an average thickness of 50 meters in the proximal and medial regions and thickens to 75 meters at the toe. Although much of the SMS is missing or covered by overlying sedimentary rocks the exposed area gives an approximate volume of 330 million cubic meters. In some basal exposures in the proximal and distal portions of the SMS there are thin, sinuous, and discontinuous layers of biotite. In the distal SMS this biotite-rich basal zone has small cobbles and gravel-size clasts that have a thin rind of biotite adhering to their outer surfaces. Exposed in the upper surface in distal portion of the SMS are sigmoidal rock flows that display a more coherent sinuous pattern. These structures may be the preserved remnants of vibrational waves that propagated through the SMS during transport. These vibrational waves may have lowered the coefficient of friction aiding the high velocity and extraordinarily long horizontal runout of 11. 7 kilometers. Paleogeographic data show the SMS traveled down entrenched alluvial fan stream channels into Fish Creek Basin where it flowed up a braided stream channel controlled by the east-southeast trend of a plutonic ridge. Paleocurrent indicators in underlying Miocene sandstone in the distal 96 portion indicate that the SMS was traveling uphill as it approached the Fish Creek Mountains. Traveling at a high speed the SMS deflected off the Fish Creek mountains to the northeast coming to a halt in a small basin separating the plutonic ridge and the Fish Creek Mountains...|$|R
40|$|Large-scale {{sandstone}} injectite complexes {{located in}} California and in Tunisia have exposures of external geometries and sedimentary structures.   Substantial macroscale erosion occurred along the margins between the injected sandstones and host mudstones that include scalloped upper margins that cut up to 5 m into the overlying host mudstones. Sedimentary structures {{preserved in the}} sandstone injectite complexes record fluid-flow, sedimentation and post-sedimentation processes.   Bedload layers moving in traction along fluid-sediment interfaces is identified as a significant transport mechanism of grains in sills, low-angle dykes, and irregular injectites, as evidenced by laminae defined by differences grain size, grain composition, and grain packing.   High-angle sandstone dykes are characterised by a distinct suite of sedimentary structures that include horizontal bands and pipes.   Horizontal bands record the movement of fluidised sand as bands during the waning phase of sand <b>injection.</b>   <b>Pipes</b> are interpreted to have formed due to post-sand-injection consolidation and fluid-escape.   The distinct sedimentary structures and microtextures that characterise each intrusive element reflect the coupled relationships between the fluid-flow and sedimentation processes and the element type. Sedimentation, post-sedimentation, and diagenetic processes thereafter, resulted {{in the formation of}} heterogeneous permeabilities; values vary three-orders-of-magnitude.   The heterogeneity is predictable and correlates with the type of intrusive element and its primary and secondary microfabrics.   This link demonstrates the influence of primary sedimentation processes and secondary diagenetic processes on the injected sandstone permeability.   By constraining the permeability heterogeneity of injected sandstones, it is possible to accurately quantify and thereby anticipate their impact on fluid flow in sedimentary basins.
