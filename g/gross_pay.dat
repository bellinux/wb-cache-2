25|$|An Ordinance of February 1982 {{limited the}} {{duration}} of fixed-term contracts to 6 to 12 months, and introduced an end of contract bonus of 5% total <b>gross</b> <b>pay</b> over the contract’s period. Another Ordinance passed that same month restricted {{the duration of}} assignments to 6 months, and increased the ‘precarious employment allowance’ from 4% to 15% of <b>gross</b> <b>pay</b> per assignment. For public sector workers, a law was passed in 1982 to prevent gender segregation in recruitment {{and to ensure that}} the situation was monitored carefully. An Act of July 1982 allowed the spouses of shopkeepers and artisans to receive social or work-related entitlements. An Act of August 1982 raised employers’ participation in financing the public transportation expenses of employees.

25|$|The federal {{payroll tax}} (FICA) {{partially}} funds Social Security and Medicare. For the Social Security portion, {{employers and employees}} each pay 6.2% of the workers <b>gross</b> <b>pay,</b> a total of 12.4%. The Social Security portion is capped at $118,500 for 2015, meaning income above this amount {{is not subject to}} the tax. It is a flat tax up to the cap, but regressive overall as it is not applied to higher incomes. The Medicare portion is also paid by employer and employee each at 1.45% and is not capped. Starting in 2013, an additional 0.9 percent more in Medicare taxes was applied to income of more than $200,000 ($250,000 for married couples filing jointly), making it a progressive tax overall.|$|E
25|$|Employee {{participants}} {{can choose}} to contribute 3%, 4% or 8% of their <b>gross</b> <b>pay,</b> and can switch rates three months after setting a rate (unless employers agree to a shorter time frame). These contributions are deducted from an employee's pay, and sent by the employer to Inland Revenue alongside their PAYE tax returns. The self-employed and unemployed can choose how much they want to contribute; while most KiwiSaver schemes have minimum contribution amounts for people in this category, several schemes allow any level of contributions. All eligible participants aged 18 to 64 starting a new job, with some exceptions, are automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver. New employees {{can choose to}} opt out from day 14 to day 56 of their employment.|$|E
500|$|If {{businesses}} provided {{employees with}} <b>gross</b> <b>pay</b> (including income tax withholding and the employee share of payroll taxes), Arduin, Laffer & Moore Econometrics estimated production costs could decrease by {{a minimum of}} 11.55% (partial accommodation). This reduction would be from {{the removal of the}} remaining embedded costs, including corporate taxes, compliance costs, and the employer share of payroll taxes. This decrease would offset a portion of the FairTax amount reflected in retail prices, which proponents suggest as the most likely scenario. Bruce Bartlett states that it is unlikely that nominal wages would be reduced, which he believes would result in a recession, but that the Federal Reserve would likely increase the money supply to accommodate price increases. [...] David Tuerck states [...] "The monetary authorities would have to consider how the degree of accommodation, varying from none to full, would affect the overall economy and how it would affect the well-being of various groups such as retirees." ...|$|E

50|$|As of 2013, {{the most}} common {{matching}} program increased to 100% of the first 6%.This program states that once the employee contributes 6% of their <b>gross</b> <b>pay,</b> the employer’s contributions stop until the following year. If the employee contributes less than 6% of their gross income, the employee foregoes additional compensation from the employer available to them had they contributed up to the 6% limit. For example, an employee whose annual <b>gross</b> <b>pay</b> is $50,000 contributes $3,000 (6% of <b>gross</b> <b>pay)</b> would receive a $3,000 employer contribution. If the employee contributed more than $3,000 the employee would not receive additional employer contributions. If the employee only contributed $2,000 (4% of <b>gross</b> <b>pay),</b> they would only receive a $2,000 employer contribution leaving $1,000 of potential employer contribution on the table.|$|E

50|$|Before {{considering}} the payroll taxes, {{it is necessary}} to talk about the basic formula for the Net Pay. From <b>gross</b> <b>pay</b> (the salary paid to the employee) one or more deductions are subtracted, to arrive at Net Pay. Thus the employee's <b>gross</b> <b>pay</b> (pay rate times number of hours worked, including any overtime) minus payroll tax deductions, minus voluntary payroll deductions, is equal to Net Pay. Payroll tax deductions play a critical role and because they are provided by law they are known as Statutory payroll tax deductions.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of {{enterprise}} bargaining on the pay position of women and other target equity groups. Contrary to "a priori" expectations the paper shows a convergence in full-time and part-time <b>gross</b> gender <b>pay</b> gaps following the adoption of decentralized wage bargaining. Convergence in the latter reflects compositional (human capital) effects: the entry of less qualified and less experienced males into part-time employment. Overall the results show a deterioration in the pay position of men employed full-time relative to women and part-timers (men and women) brought about by slower wage growth amongst men in full-time employment.
