2500|$|On Neuhaus: [...] "I {{learned a}} lot from him, even though he kept saying that {{there was nothing he could}} teach me. Music is written to be played and listened to and has always seemed to me to be able to manage without words... This was exactly the case with Heinrich Neuhaus. In his {{presence}} I was almost always reduced to total silence. This was an extremely good thing, as it meant that we concentrated exclusively on the music. Above all, he taught me the meaning of silence and the meaning of singing. He said I was incredibly obstinate and did only what I wanted to. It's true that I've only ever played what I wanted. And so <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>me</b> to do as I liked." ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{week after}} this conversation, Fitzwilliam hosted a dinner at which Burke was present. He and Burke twice talked privately, with Fitzwilliam urging Burke to {{reconcile}} with Fox, [...] "or {{at least some}} steps towards it". As Burke wrote to his son Richard on 20 March: [...] "I gave him such reasons why it could not be, yet at least, as made him not condemn me, though <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>me,</b> after our last conversation, in a mood sufficiently melancholy. He is, in truth, a man of wonderful honour, good nature and integrity". On 11 April the Society of the Friends of the People was founded, which called for parliamentary reform. Fitzwilliam wrote to Zouch on 5 June that the reform societies in London, Sheffield, Manchester and Norwich were: ...|$|E

"Just wot I thought, miss," [...] {{said the}} complaisant Mr. Smith; [...] "but I s'pose {{there was nobody}} else, and he wanted 'is message to go for fear you should get {{worrying}} the police about 'im or something. He wants it kep' quiet, and 'is last words to <b>me</b> as <b>'e</b> <b>left</b> <b>me</b> was, 'If this affair gets known I shall never come back. Tell 'em to keep it quiet.'" ...|$|R

He was an uncle of Will Scammel, my father that died, but he wasn't very {{friendly}} to him an' didn't give him any money while he lived. Ma named me after the Senator, though, 'cause she knew which side her bread was buttered on, an' now <b>he's</b> <b>left</b> <b>me</b> ten thousand dollars in his will." ...|$|R
2500|$|Certain Germans helped {{prisoners in}} their escape attempts. During his second try, Robert d'Harcourt hid in a warehouse, where a German found him. The latter did not {{denounce}} him, instead helping him {{leave the city}} that night: “ then he guided me across a maze of back-alleys and yards, through which I would never have found my way alone, until {{the entrance to a}} street where <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>me,</b> not without first vigorously shaking my hand and wishing me good luck." [...] The sympathy of women is equally remarked upon by Riou and d'Harcourt. Once the escape was successful, the prisoner was sent to his regimental barracks to undergo an interrogation. In effect, the home authorities had to make sure the escape was authentic and not a spy trick. If the operation failed, the escapee was taken back to the camp to be punished. The frustration generated by failure very often led the recaptured prisoner to develop plans for the next attempt; this was the case for Charles de Gaulle and Robert d’Harcourt. Of 313,400 escapes counted for the war’s duration, 67,565 succeeded.|$|E
2500|$|From London, Wild had {{obtained}} an assistant research officer {{job with the}} Council for Scientific and Industrial Research at the Radiophysics Laboratory near Sydney. He described the position as [...] "a humble one": to maintain and develop test equipment. But within a year he had, as he put it, [...] "wheedled his way" [...] into the new science of radio astronomy, and he described 1948–50 as a tremendously exciting time.... The only two really powerful groups in radio astronomy were the Australian one and Cambridge; and... we all thought we had the edge over the Cambridge group. [...] Joe Pawsey {{was the sort of}} father of radio astronomy in Australia. He was a wonderfully inspiring leader, very self-effacing and taking no credit for himself, and he was a delight to work under. And he did something which I appreciated greatly: <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>me</b> alone to do my own research but I could come to him at any time and get his advice.This advice, Wild acknowledged, [...] "was often very perceptive, very good". Pawsey’s approach became a template that Wild would follow.|$|E

6000|$|... "Stay, I {{will run}} {{back for the}} packet <b>he</b> <b>left</b> with <b>me</b> to give to you. He may perhaps wish to give it you with his own hand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, mother, {{contrary}} {{to all my}} expectations, and I may say wishes, <b>he</b> has <b>left</b> <b>me</b> twenty-five thousand pounds in the fives. I only hold the money as my father's trustee." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{with that}} answer <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>me.</b> I {{would much rather}} he had knocked me down.|$|E
60|$|I hid {{nothing from}} him, and he in return exhorted me to sincere repentance, {{explained}} to me {{what he meant by}} repentance, and then drew out such a scheme of infinite mercy, proclaimed from heaven to sinners of the greatest magnitude, that <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>me</b> nothing to say, that looked like despair, or doubting of being accepted; and in this condition <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>me</b> the first night.|$|E
60|$|I {{asked him}} to bring me the bag from my bicycle, and after doing so <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|With that he {{made off}} up the sliding deck like a squirrel, and plunged into the cabin. About {{half an hour later}} he returned--I still lying as <b>he</b> had <b>left</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|ACRES Egad, but I will, Jack. Sir Lucius has wrought me to it. <b>He</b> has <b>left</b> <b>me</b> full of rage--and I'll {{fight this}} evening, {{that so much}} good passion mayn't be wasted.|$|R
6000|$|Adherent {{to his own}} {{religion}} (in him was not {{the stuff}} of which is made the facile apostate), <b>he</b> freely <b>left</b> <b>me</b> my pure faith. He did not tease nor tempt. He said:-- ...|$|R
60|$|Upon that <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>me,</b> and <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>me</b> with {{a certain}} comfort. And {{in the days that}} followed, I acted upon his injunction, though, truth to tell, there was little {{provocation}} to do otherwise. The Duke ignored me, and all the gentlemen of his following did the like, including Cosimo. And meanwhile they revelled at Pagliano and made free with the hospitality to which they had not been bidden.|$|E
60|$|He {{went away}} with the tears in his eyes; and <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>me,</b> I own it, with the tears in mine.|$|E
60|$|He {{sat with}} me {{half an hour}} longer, {{carefully}} reviewing his instructions, and then <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>me</b> to a night of contemplation.|$|E
60|$|With that he {{made off}} up the sliding deck like a squirrel, and plunged into the cabin. About {{half an hour later}} he {{returned}} - I still lying as <b>he</b> had <b>left</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd never 'ave left 'im, Bobby, if <b>he</b> 'adn't <b>left</b> <b>me.</b> You know that. An' if I {{thought he}} was alive and know'd w'ere he was, I'd go back to 'im yet, but--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{trust that}} it may be so," [...] {{answered}} Marcus, [...] "although in truth that another man should die for me gives me no comfort. Rather would I that <b>he</b> had <b>left</b> <b>me</b> to my doom." ...|$|R
60|$|With that <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>me.</b> If {{he means}} any further mischief, I {{can tell him}} this--he will find Me in his way.|$|E
60|$|We were {{standing}} before the fire-place. <b>He</b> <b>left</b> <b>me,</b> and walked away slowly with his head down, apparently intending to leave the room.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>left</b> <b>me</b> again, {{opened the}} door of the room and looked out {{cautiously}} into the passage, closed it once more, and came back.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> vanished, and <b>left</b> <b>me</b> appalled; for I knew, and realized, {{that all}} he had said was true.|$|R
50|$|An {{acquaintance}} of mine, cartoonist Garry Trudeau, went {{a long time}} without going on TV, {{and we talked about}} having a 12-step program for people who appear on television too much. It would be a boom business in Washington. But Garry has lapses - he's been on Nightline, Charlie Rose. I also believe he did a morning show one time. But I've been steadfast. I have not been broken. I thought it was me and Garry against the world, the two amigos. <b>He's</b> <b>left</b> <b>me</b> hanging out there.|$|R
6000|$|Altho' <b>he</b> has <b>left</b> <b>me</b> for greed o' the siller, [...] I dinna envy him {{the gains}} he can win; [...] I rather wad bear a' the lade o' my sorrow, [...] Than ever hae acted sae faithless to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "God or the fiend can say alone. When {{he found}} that I was smitten with the plague <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>me</b> to perish, as did the others." ...|$|E

6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>left</b> <b>me</b> {{without another}} word. I {{returned}} to the bedside. As I approached, Guest deliberately opened one eye and then closed it again. I addressed him in French: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am rich," [...] replies the lad. [...] "My {{father worked}} hard and saved, and <b>he</b> has <b>left</b> <b>me</b> all his wealth. I have stocks and shares, and lands and factories; and will pay any price in reason for this thing." ...|$|R
60|$|I shouted abuse after him, but he {{went away}} laughing, and I had to manage as best I could with what <b>he</b> had <b>left</b> <b>me.</b> In half an hour {{he came to the}} door. 'Do you want to come out?' he said.|$|R
60|$|As {{we shook}} hands, Jeanne {{asked me if}} I knew where her uncle was. I could only tell her that <b>he</b> had <b>left</b> <b>me</b> at my own door. She made no remark; but {{she seemed to be}} uneasy on {{receiving}} that reply.|$|R
