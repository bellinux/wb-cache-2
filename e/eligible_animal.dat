However, molecular mechanisms underlying the relationship between TBI and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease (AD), remain to be elucidated. Nevertheless, previous studies have demonstrated a link between TBI and increased amyloid-β (Aβ), a protein involved in AD pathogenesis. Here, we review animal studies that measured Aβ levels following TBI. In addition, from a pool of initially identified 1209 published papers, we examined data from 19 <b>eligible</b> <b>animal</b> model studies using a meta-analytic approach. We found an acute increase in cerebral Aβ levels ranging from 24 h to one month following TBI (overall log OR = 2. 97 ± 0. 40, p 3 ̆c 0. 001). These findings may contribute to further understanding the relationship between TBI and future dementia risk. The methodological inconsistencies of the studies discussed in this review suggest the need for improved and more standardised data collection and study design, in order to properly elucidate the role of TBI in the expression and accumulation of Aβ. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Chronic {{secondary}} lymphedema is {{a well-known}} complication in oncologic surgery. Autologous lymph node transplantation, lymphovenous anastomosis, and other lymphatic surgeries have been developed in the last decades with rising clinical application. Animal models to explore the pathophysiology of lymphedema and microsurgical interventions have reached great popularity, although the induction of stable lymphedema in animals is still challenging. The aim of this review was to systematically assess lymphedema animal models and their potential use to study surgical interventions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review according to the PRISMA guidelines was performed without time or language restriction. Studies describing new or partially new models were included in chronological order. Models for primary and secondary lymphedema were assessed, and their potential for surgical procedures was evaluated. RESULTS: The systematic search yielded 8590 discrete articles. Of 180 articles included on basis of title, 84 were excluded after abstract review. Ninety-six {{were included in the}} final analysis with 24 key articles. CONCLUSIONS: No animal model is perfect, and many models show spontaneous lymphedema resolution. The rodent limb appears to be the most <b>eligible</b> <b>animal</b> model for experimental reconstruction of the lymphatic function as it is well accessible for vascularized tissue transfer. There is a need for standardized parameters in experimental lymphedema quantification. Also, more permanent models to study the effect of free vascularized lymph node transfer are needed...|$|E

Most {{of them do}} not consider all <b>eligible</b> <b>animals</b> and do not consider different management strategies at farm level. This problem can be alleviated by measuring the proportion of pregnant cows by specific intervals after their calving date or after a fixed time period, such as the voluntary waiting period. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate two reproductive performance indicators that consider the voluntary waiting period at the herd. The two indicators were: percentage of pregnant cows in the herd after the voluntary waiting period plus 30 days (PV 30) and percentage of inseminated cows in the herd after the voluntary waiting period plus 30 days (IV 30). We wanted to assess how PV 30 and IV 30 perform in a simulation of herds with different reproductive management and physiology and to compare them to indicators of reproductive performance that do not consider the herd voluntary waiting period.

40|$|AbstractIn Ireland, an {{estimated}} 15 % of Irish soils exceed the EU threshold limit for soil Cd of 1 mg/kg. The {{aim was to}} determine the concentrations of Cd and other heavy metals (As, Hg and Pb) in kidneys collected from cattle at slaughter. Systematic sampling of <b>eligible</b> <b>animals</b> (animals that were born and reared until slaughter in the same Irish county) at the time of slaughter was conducted, until a threshold number of animals from all 26 counties and 6 age categories was reached. A predictive surface of soil Cd was generated, by kriging the Cd values of 1310 previously reported soil samples. A linear regression weighted model was developed to model kidney Cd concentration, using the risk factors of age, sex, breed, province and estimated soil Cd concentration. Kidney Cd (n= 393) concentrations varied between 0. 040 and 8. 630 mg/kg wet weight; while concentrations of As, Hg and Pb were low. The estimated weighted proportion of animals with a high (≥ 1 mg/kg) kidney Cd concentration was 11. 25 % (95 % CI: 8. 63 – 14. 53 %). Key predictors for high kidney Cd concentration were soil Cd, animal age and province. At a soil Cd concentration of 1. 5 mg/kg, it was predicted that an age threshold to avoid exceeding a kidney Cd concentration of 1 mg/kg in most animals would be ~ 3 y in Connacht, > 4 y in Ulster, and > 5 y in Leinster and Munster. In naturally occurring areas of high Cd levels in soils in Ireland, the Cd level in bovine kidneys can exceed the current EU ML of 1 mg/kg in older animals. Kidneys of most cattle under three years of age will conform with EU requirements...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{will examine}} the effects of policy {{developments}} on the Irish beef sector, with a particular focus on agricultural subsidy payments. As a member of the European Union, Irish agriculture is governed by the Common Agricultural Policy. This complex and extensive policy has undergone a number of reforms since it was initially implemented. Irish farmers have benefited both financially and structurally through many different income support and capital support schemes. This thesis is particularly interested in how historical subsidy payments, coupled to production, affected farmer behaviour by influencing the choices farmers made in relation to stocking rates on their farms. Payments that were linked to producing specific agricultural products or keeping specific animal types were highly regulated with upper limits on the number of <b>eligible</b> <b>animals</b> or acres. Where limits were reached, payment levels changed thus creating non-linear budget constraints. These non-linearities provide a unique set of circumstances to test neo-classical consumer choice theory and look for evidence of rational farmer behaviour. Non-linear budget constraints are of particular interest in the fields of public and labour economics, where techniques have been developed to understand and predict labour supply decisions in relation to changes in taxation. In this thesis the same techniques are applied to understand stocking rate decisions in relation to subsidies. As a primary sector, agriculture has a duel role both in producing food and protecting the environment. Agricultural policy has the additional responsibility ensuring that the farmers who produce this food and act as caretakers of the primary factor of production, the land, receive an adequate income for doing so. Understanding farmer behaviour is therefore important for a number of reasons; firstly the ability to predict how individuals will react to a policy change is important for policy design. Secondly, proper identification of how individuals will react is significant for policy evaluation. 2017 - 07 - 0...|$|R

We wanted to assess how PV 30 and IV 30 perform in a simulation of herds with different reproductive management and physiology and to compare them to indicators of reproductive performance that do not consider the herd voluntary waiting period. Methods To evaluate the reproductive indicators we used the SimHerd-program, a stochastic simulation model, and 18 scenarios were simulated. The scenarios were designed by altering the reproductive management efficiency and the status of reproductive physiology of the herd. Logistic regression models, together with receiver operating characteristics (ROC), were used to examine how well the reproductive performance indicators could discriminate between herds of different levels of reproductive management efficiency or reproductive physiology. Results The logistic regression models with the ROC analysis showed that IV 30 was the indicator that best discriminated between different levels of management efficiency followed by PV 30, calving interval, 200 -days not-in calf-rate (NotIC 200), in calf rate at 100 -days (IC 100) and a fertility index. For reproductive physiology the ROC analysis showed that the fertility index was the indicator that best discriminated between different levels, followed by PV 30, NotIC 200, IC 100 and the calving interval. IV 30 could not discriminate between the two levels. Conclusion PV 30 is the single best performance indicator for estimating the level of both herd management efficiency and reproductive physiology followed by NotIC 200 and IC 100. This indicates that PV 30 could be a potential candidate for inclusion in dairy herd improvement schemes. </p...|$|R

Many studies have investigated whether prophylactic inhalation of amphotericin B (AMB) reduces the incidence of IPA, but no definitive conclusions have been reached. The present meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic inhalation of AMB {{for the prevention of}} IPA. Methods: MEDLINE and other databases were searched for relevant articles published until December 2013. Randomized controlled trials that compared aerosolized AMB with placebo were included. Two reviewers independently assessed and extracted the data of all trials. Results: Six animal studies and two clinical trials involving 768 high-risk patients were <b>eligible.</b> The <b>animal</b> studies showed lower overall mortality rate among animals that underwent aerosolized AMB prophylaxis (odds ratio (OR) 0. 13, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 08 – 0. 21).

The aim {{of the present study}} was therefore to investigate the impact on survival of intra-abdominally administered Hyalobarrier-gel, native hyaluronan (HA) and hyaluronan/carboxymethylcellulose (HA/CMC), after intraperitoneal tumour implantation. METHODS: After receiving an intraperitoneal inoculum of the human HT 29 colorectal cell line, 615 athymic nude mice were assigned randomly to five groups: groups 1 and 2 received Hyalobarrier-gel 20 mg/ml (n = 124) and 40 mg/ml (n = 126) respectively; groups 3 and 4 received HA (n = 120) and HA/CMC film (Seprafilm) (n = 123) respectively. The survival of each treated group was compared with that of group 5, the control, which had no treatment (n = 122). RESULTS: As 34 of the 615 mice were not <b>eligible,</b> 581 <b>animals</b> were considered for the analysis. At 120 days, 136 animals (23. 4 per cent) were still alive. At autopsy there was macroscopic absence of tumour in 75 cases (12. 9 per cent). No statistically significant differences were found between the treatment and the control groups with respect to postoperative death and absence of tumour implantation. There was no difference in survival rate between the control group and groups treated with Hyalobarrier-gel, HA or HA/CMC. CONCLUSION: Hyalobarrier-gel, HA and HA/CMC had no negative impact on the survival rate in mice that received an intraperitoneal implantation of HT 29 colorectal human tumour cells...|$|R

There are described following positive effects of anethole in human medicine: vasorelaxant, antithrombotic, releasing of heart function, fytoestrogenic (it mean improving of milk secretion, menstruation, promotion of menses, birth improvement, men’s hormonal changes improving, sexual libido improving), antioxidative, antifungal, improvement of derma permeability, antihelmintic, insecticidal, yeast elimination, antibacterial, antipyretic. In our work the effect of anise and fennel essential oils on nutrients utilization in pig experiment was evaluated. The trial was organized in accredited experimental stable Žabčice of Mendel University of Agriculture and Forestry Brno. The high level efficiency of experimental animals is mentioned through general parameters (average daily gain, feed intake and feed conversion). The results of nutrients utilization rate show slightly higher digestibility of nutrients in treatment with anise oil, this improvement is not higher then 1. 0 [*]%. We can see also improvement of nitrogen retention in body mass on level of 5. 6 [*]% (anise treatment compared with control group). There is low variability between experimental animals (except nitrogen retention coefficient) but we can not see any statistical significance.

40|$|ObjectiveCardiopulmonary {{resuscitation}} {{is associated}} with high mortality and poor neurological recovery. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation can cause ischemia–reperfusion injury of the whole body and brain. We assessed the hypothesis that controlled reperfusion of the whole body with cardiopulmonary bypass would limit reperfusion injury after 15 minutes of normothermic cardiac arrest with better survival and neurological recovery. MethodsEleven pigs were exposed to normothermic ischemia for 15 minutes by inducing ventricular fibrillation, followed by cardiopulmonary resuscitation (control group, n = 4) or 60 minutes of cardiopulmonary bypass (treatment group, n = 7). Conditions of reperfusion and the reperfusate were controlled with cardiopulmonary bypass. Animals were observed for up to 7 days, and neurological assessment (Neurological Deficit Score: 0, normal; 500, brain death), magnetic resonance imaging, and brain histology were performed. ResultsAll animals {{in the control group}} died after 20 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (n = 4). All (n =  7) survived in the treatment group. Clinically apparent neurological recovery occurred within 24 hours; 1  fully conscious pig could not walk. The Neurological Deficit Score was 98 ± 31 in all animals (n = 7) after 24 hours and decreased to 0 after 48 hours in 4 of 5 <b>eligible</b> animals; 1 <b>animal</b> had a Neurological Deficit Score of 110 after 3 days. Brain histology revealed hypoxic and apoptotic neurons with an inconclusive correlation regarding neurological recovery. ConclusionClinically apparent neurological recovery after a period of 15 minutes of cardiac arrest occurred with cardiopulmonary bypass instead of cardiopulmonary resuscitation for reperfusing the whole body. This approach contrasts with cardiopulmonary resuscitation, in which resuscitation has been reported as successful after only 3 to 5 minutes of cardiac arrest. Cardiopulmonary bypass might be a key to improve survival and neurological recovery after cardiac arrest...|$|R

Pre-clinical studies in a large-animal model, especially in swine or miniature pigs, are highly relevant to human applications. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been isolated and expanded from different sources. Objective: This study aimed at isolating and characterizing, for the first time, bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) from a Brazilian minipig (BR 1). Also, this aimed to validate a new large-animal model for stem cell-based tissue engineering. Material and Methods: Bone marrow (BM) was aspirated from the posterior iliac crest of twelve adult male BR 1 under general anesthesia. MSCs were selected by plastic-adherence as originally described by Friedenstein. Cell morphology, surface marker expression, and cellular differentiation were examined. The immunophenotypic profile was determined by flow cytometry. The differentiation potential was assessed by cytological staining and by RT-PCR. Results: MSCs were present in all minipig BM samples. These cells showed fibroblastic morphology and were positive for the surface markers CD 90 (88. 6 %), CD 29 (89. 8 %), CD 44 (86. 9 %) and negative for CD 34 (1. 61 %), CD 45 (1. 83 %), CD 14 (1. 77 %) and MHC-II (2. 69 %). MSCs were differentiated into adipocytes, osteoblasts, and chondroblasts as demonstrated by the presence of lipidic-rich vacuoles, the mineralized extracellular matrix, and the great presence of glycosaminoglycans, respectively. The higher gene expression of adipocyte fatty-acid binding protein (AP 2), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and collagen type 2 (COLII) also confirmed the trilineage differentiation (p< 0. 001, p< 0. 001, p= 0. 031; respectively).
