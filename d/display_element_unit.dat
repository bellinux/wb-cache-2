40|$|An Automatic Optical Inspection (AOI) {{system for}} optical {{inspection}} of imaging devices used in automotive industry using an inspecting optics of lower spatial resolution than the device under inspection is described. This system is robust {{and with no}} moving parts. The cycle time is small. Its main advantage {{is that it is}} capable of detecting and quantifying defects in regular patterns, working below the Shannon-Nyquist criterion for optical resolution, using a single low resolution image sensor. It is easily scalable, which is an important advantage in industrial applications, since the same inspecting sensor can be reused for increasingly higher spatial resolutions of the devices to be inspected. The optical inspection is implemented with a notch multi-band Fourier filter, making the procedure especially fitted for regular patterns, like the ones that can be produced in image displays and Head Up Displays (HUDs). The regular patterns are used in production line only, for inspection purposes. For image displays, functional defects are detected at the level of a sub-image <b>display</b> grid <b>element</b> <b>unit.</b> Functional defects are the ones impairing the function of the display, and are preferred in AOI to the direct geometric imaging, since those are the ones directly related with the end-user experience. The shift in emphasis from geometric imaging to functional imaging is critical, since it is this that allows quantitative inspection, below Shannon-Nyquist. For HUDs, the functional detect detection addresses defects resulting from the combined effect of the image display and the image forming optics.

40|$|A {{contingent}} {{uncertainty of}} one bit is perceptible when imposed upon {{a combination of}} two binary-coded visual display variables, but not when imposed upon a combination of three variables. Why? The limitation may be sought in the average amount of the constraint, {{in the form of}} the constraint, or in the particular selection of display variables. Tests were carried out in which apparently equivalent informational constraints were imposed upon a single display variable. Such constraints were highly discriminable. Further tests reveal that the limiting feature for the detection of multi-variate constraints is probably the mean constraint level, averaged over all <b>display</b> <b>elements,</b> rather than the constraint level imposed upon the constrained <b>display</b> <b>elements...</b>|$|R

On each trial, the <b>display</b> <b>elements</b> (two discs) appeared either separated or connected (either via a white line or side by side) and subjects reported whether they observed element motion or group motion at various ISIs. Although it was hypothesized that element motion would be eliminated in the connected condition, subjects observed element motion at short ISIs {{in the form of a}} three dimensional illusion in which one element appeared to rotate out in front of (or behind) the other. Implications for short range and long range motion processes are discussed...|$|R
