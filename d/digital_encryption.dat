30|$|With the {{increasing}} demand for image encryption, many domestic and foreign scholars have proposed many different encryption techniques and methods {{in the field of}} <b>digital</b> image <b>encryption.</b> Typical algorithms or techniques in common use mainly include <b>digital</b> image <b>encryption</b> based on pixel transformation, <b>digital</b> image <b>encryption</b> based on random sequence, <b>digital</b> image <b>encryption</b> based on image compression coding, and <b>digital</b> image <b>encryption</b> based on image key. The chaos technology is difficult to crack and randomness, which makes the <b>digital</b> image <b>encryption</b> technology based on chaos technology become a more reliable <b>digital</b> image <b>encryption</b> technology. Many researchers have introduced chaos concept to improve the precision and security of chaos technology. In the 1980 s [14], British mathematician Matthews first proposed an encryption method based on logistic chaotic system. In Matthews’ encryption method, the encryption technology type is stream encryption technology, which specifically combines chaotic power and cryptography. Although the encryption technology and method cannot meet the commercial requirements in terms of encryption precision, encryption security capability, and actual encryption efficiency, it plays a vital role in the development and application of chaotic encryption technology. Then, Toshiki Habutsu [15], a Japanese scholar, published the iterative encryption method of chaotic cipher in European cryptography conference, which is a major breakthrough for chaotic encryption technology. Subsequently, the cryptography community’s research on chaotic encryption technology developed rapidly. American scholar Fridrich [16] proposed a chaotic encryption technology and method based on two-dimensional Baker mapping and applied it to the encryption and protection of digital images. It is the first application and practice of chaotic encryption in the field of <b>digital</b> image <b>encryption</b> [17 – 21]. In order to improve the security and reliability of chaotic encryption technology, some scholars have extended the two-dimensional chaotic encryption method to realize chaotic encryption methods in three-dimensional space and multidimensional space [22 – 27]. However, in the three-dimensional chaotic encryption process, the scrambling operation and the obfuscation operation processing steps are still processed in an isolated manner, and fixed control parameters are adopted in the processing, so that the chaotic encryption algorithm and method still appear to be broken.|$|R

30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} <b>digital</b> image <b>encryption</b> method based on double {{logistic}} chaotic map. In the double chaotic <b>digital</b> image <b>encryption,</b> second-level logistic chaotic map is mainly {{used to create}} and generate pseudorandom sequence numbers, {{and the number of}} random sequences of image confusion and scrambling is obtained through two creation processes. In the process of encryption and decryption, the key used in the double chaotic <b>digital</b> image <b>encryption</b> method is the calculation parameter of the first-level logistic chaotic map and the initial value of the second-level logistic chaotic map. The encryption process is performed in the order of confusion and scrambling, and the decryption process is processed in the reverse order. The simulation results of the picture show that the histogram, pixel correlation, information entropy, key space size, and key sensitivity all reach a high level, and the image decryption processing can be completed basically correctly.|$|R

30|$|With the {{development}} of information technology, image information has become the main content of network information transmission. With {{the development}} of image encryption technology, it is also about {{the development of}} image information theft technology. In order to cope with the evolving information theft technology, we must seek a better image encryption algorithm. Among many algorithms, due to the superiority of chaos technology, when the image is encrypted with chaos technology, the ciphertext presents a randomness, which makes the possibility of deciphering greatly reduced. Therefore, the research of <b>digital</b> image <b>encryption</b> algorithm based on chaos technology has become an important means of modern <b>digital</b> image <b>encryption.</b> In this paper, the <b>digital</b> image <b>encryption</b> technology is studied with the dual logistic chaotic map as a tool. The simulation experiments are carried out by using the classical Lena image and the life picture, and the results are analyzed from the histogram, pixel correlation, information entropy, key space size, key sensitivity, and so on. The results show that the method used in this paper has a better security effect.|$|R

30|$|The <b>digital</b> image chaotic <b>encryption</b> {{technology}} {{is to use}} chaotic mapping to encrypt and protect the digital image and to design the corresponding decryption method. At present, the <b>digital</b> image <b>encryption</b> technology or method based on the chaotic system mainly uses the chaotic mapping to create the pseudorandom sequence, different from the traditional method of using computer software to create pseudorandom number. As long as the same initial value {{is set in the}} data encryption technique based on a chaotic system, the sequence of pseudorandom number is exactly the same and the randomness of the sequence is better. In the <b>digital</b> image chaotic <b>encryption</b> system, the encryption can be realized by using the pseudorandom number sequence generated by the image pixel set and chaos, and the decryption process can perform the inverse operation.|$|R
