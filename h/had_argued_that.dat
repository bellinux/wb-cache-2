5|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, scholars have debated whether El Greco's style had Byzantine origins. Certain art historians had asserted that El Greco's roots were firmly in the Byzantine tradition, and that his most individual characteristics derive directly from the art of his ancestors, while others <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Byzantine art could not be related to El Greco's later work.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Malthus <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{population}} growth beyond resources was ordained by God to get humans to work productively and show restraint in getting families, this {{was used in}} the 1830s to justify workhouses and laissez-faire economics. Evolution was by then seen as having social implications, and Herbert Spencer's 1851 book Social Statics based ideas of human freedom and individual liberties on his Lamarckian evolutionary theory.|$|E
5|$|Weizmann <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the {{declaration}} would have three effects: it would swing Russia to maintain pressure on Germany's Eastern Front, since Jews had been {{prominent in the}} March Revolution of 1917; it would rally the large Jewish community in the United States to press for greater funding for the American war effort, underway since April of that year; and, lastly, that it would undermine German Jewish support for Kaiser Wilhelm II.|$|E
2500|$|Robert Birrell <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{immigration}} is creating social divisions and risks long-term national unity. Anthropologist and ethologist Frank Salter <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{immigration is}} creating [...] "ethnic stratification" [...] in Australian society.|$|R
50|$|Wendy Davies <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{the later}} medieval Welsh {{approach}} to property and estates was a Roman legacy, but {{this issue and}} others related to legacy are not yet resolved. For example, Leslie Alcock <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> that the approach to property and estates cannot pre-date the 6th century and is thus post-Roman.|$|R
5000|$|American generals <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> these raids are a [...] "critical" [...] part of {{achieving}} {{success in the}} war. Afghani president Hamid Karzai <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> they impinge upon Afghanistan's sovereignty and has called {{for them to be}} halted.|$|R
5|$|As {{a part of}} Las Casas's defense by offense, he had {{to argue}} against Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda. Sepúlveda was a doctor of {{theology}} and law who, in his book Democrates Alter, sive de justis causis apud Indos (Another Democrates /or A New Democrates, or on the Just Causes of War against the Indians) <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> some native peoples were incapable of ruling themselves and should be pacified forcefully. The book was deemed unsound for publication by the theologians of Salamanca and Alcalá for containing unsound doctrine, but the pro-encomendero faction seized on Sepúlveda as their intellectual champion.|$|E
5|$|Charles Darwin <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{humanity}} {{evolved in}} Africa, {{because this is}} where great apes like gorillas and chimpanzees lived. Though Darwin's claims have since been vindicated by the fossil record, they were proposed without any fossil evidence. Other scientific authorities disagreed with him, like Charles Lyell, a geologist, and Alfred Russel Wallace, who had thought {{of the theory of}} evolution around the same time as Darwin. Because both Lyell and Wallace believed that humans were more closely related to gibbons and orangutans, they identified Southeast Asia as the cradle of humanity because this is where these apes lived. Dutch anatomist Eugène Dubois favored the latter theory, and sought to confirm it.|$|E
5|$|Hans Turnwald is {{not listed}} by the Association of Knight's Cross Recipients (AKCR). According to Veit Scherzer, on 8 May 1945, Turnwald, as Leutnant of the Reserves {{and leader of}} Jagdpanzer-Kompanie 1015, had been {{nominated}} for the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. The nomination of the Heerespersonalamt (HPA—Army Personnel Office) was ready for signature but the process was never completed. In similar instances the AKCR <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the presentation was {{in accordance with the}} Dönitz-decree. This is illegal according to the Deutsche Dienststelle (WASt) and lacks legal justification. Scherzer claims that the AKCR forgot to list him.|$|E
50|$|Lax <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Finland {{would be}} better off if it sought {{membership}} of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the time is now, and the option would not be available if the current peaceful situation changed.|$|R
50|$|Some writers <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{philosophers}} such as Plato, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Ferdinand de Saussure have promoted phonocentric views. Walter Ong, who {{has also}} expressed support {{for the idea of}} phonocentrism, <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the culture of the United States is particularly non-phonocentric.|$|R
50|$|Critics <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> governments treated {{this crisis}} {{as one of}} {{investor}} confidence rather than deeply indebted institutions unable to lend, delaying the appropriate remedies. Others <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> this crisis represents a reset of economic activity, rather than a recession or cyclical downturn.|$|R
5|$|In {{the first}} {{superstring}} revolution in 1984, many physicists turned to string theory {{as a unified}} theory of particle physics and quantum gravity. Unlike supergravity theory, string theory was able to accommodate the chirality of the standard model, and it provided a theory of gravity consistent with quantum effects. Another feature of string theory that many physicists were drawn to in the 1980s and 1990s was its high degree of uniqueness. In ordinary particle theories, one can consider any collection of elementary particles whose classical behavior is described by an arbitrary Lagrangian. In string theory, the possibilities are much more constrained: by the 1990s, physicists <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> there were only five consistent supersymmetric versions of the theory.|$|E
5|$|Moxon {{represented}} manager Ken Hoden of the Church of Scientology's Golden Era Productions in February 1998 when {{he filed}} {{a restraining order}} against Keith Henson after Henson protested against Scientology in May 1997 and January 1998 outside the Golden Era film studios in Gilman Hot Springs, California. Moxon <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Henson was dangerous based on comments critical of Scientologists he had posted on the Internet, and his knowledge in the fields of cryonics and explosives. Hoden received a temporary restraining order against Henson, but the Riverside Superior Court judge refused to make the restraining order permanent.|$|E
5|$|Ophelia {{has also}} been defended by feminist critics, most notably Elaine Showalter. Ophelia is {{surrounded}} by powerful men: her father, brother, and Hamlet. All three disappear: Laertes leaves, Hamlet abandons her, and Polonius dies. Conventional theories <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> without these three powerful men making decisions for her, Ophelia is driven into madness. Feminist theorists argue that she goes mad with guilt because, when Hamlet kills her father, he has fulfilled her sexual desire to have Hamlet kill her father {{so they can be}} together. Showalter points out that Ophelia has become the symbol of the distraught and hysterical woman in modern culture.|$|E
50|$|Unfair {{dismissal}} is now {{governed by}} the Labour Relations Act. Some <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the Labour Relations Act undermines the flexibility required for the free market to exist. Others <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> a restrictive labour law promotes job security, loyalty and incorporation into companies.|$|R
25|$|Some {{critics of}} the {{scientific}} consensus on global warming <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> these issues should not be linked and that reference to them constitutes an unjustified ad hominem attack. Political scientist Roger Pielke, Jr., responding to Mooney, <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> science is inevitably intertwined with politics.|$|R
5000|$|Schluter has founded two organisations which {{research}} relationships, Relationships Foundation and Relational Research. Schluter {{has also}} written several books on the subject. Schluter <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> modern society takes very little account of relationships and <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the prevailing understanding of Capitalism in the West has [...] "built within it a framework of thinking that says {{the growth of the}} capital is more important than relationships." [...] He <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> instead,society should focus on the importance of relationships whether that is in education or in companies.|$|R
5|$|The Court found {{support for}} its {{position}} {{in the history of the}} unratified Titles of Nobility Amendment. The fact that this 1810 proposal had been framed as a constitutional amendment, rather than an ordinary act of Congress, was seen by the majority as showing that, even before the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress did not believe that it had the power to revoke anyone's citizenship. The Court further noted that a proposed 1818 act of Congress would have provided a way for citizens to voluntarily relinquish their citizenship, but opponents <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Congress had no authority to provide for expatriation.|$|E
5|$|The Mission {{site had}} been under study for {{conservation}} since 2002. The three main buildings on the site were eventually gazetted for conservation in 2006, and hence the site was inappropriate for acquisition. Although the appellant <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> a football field on the Mission site should have been acquired instead of the temple property, the three main buildings were functionally integrated and acquisition of part of the Mission site {{would have resulted in}} a plot of state land that was highly irregular in shape. In any case, the appellant's argument did not relate to proper land use planning.|$|E
5|$|The {{predominant}} {{position of}} Islamic scholars {{had been that}} a Muslim could not stay {{in a country where}} rulers made proper religious observance impossible: therefore, a Muslim's obligation was to leave when they were able to. Even before the systematic forced conversion, religious leaders <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Muslims in Christian territory would be subject to direct and indirect pressure, and preached emigration as a way to protect the religion from eroding. Ahmad al-Wansharis, the contemporary North African scholar and leading authority on Spanish Muslims, wrote in 1491 that emigrating from Christian to Muslim lands was compulsory in almost all circumstances. Further, he urged severe punishment for Muslims who remained and predicted that they would temporarily dwell in hell in the afterlife.|$|E
50|$|The {{location}} of this battle is not known. Whiteway <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{this place is}} identical with Amba Geshen, located far {{to the south of}} the Portuguese camp. More recently, however, C.F. Beckingham <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the battle took place in the eastern Semien Mountains near the left bank of the Tekezé River.|$|R
50|$|Many {{observers}} <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> India's labour laws {{should be}} reformed.|$|R

5|$|Alejandro Gonzalez Malavé, the {{undercover}} agent who was accompanying the activists, was not indicted {{for his part}} in the slayings because he was granted immunity for testifying against other officers, but was removed from the police force due to public pressure. In February 1986, he was acquitted of kidnapping the taxi driver. His lawyer <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> he was acting under orders and, therefore, it was the government who was actually guilty of kidnapping. This, despite the testimony presented by officer Carmelo Cruz who had testified that it was Gonzalez who recklessly endangered the hostage's life. The prosecution had provided evidence that he threatened the hostage at gunpoint, drove the car, and, when the car approached the mountaintop, refused to free the hostage despite suggestions from the activists. These actions, according to officer Cruz, were contrary to standard police procedures since his primary concern should have been the safety of the hostage. Nevertheless, the Puerto Rico Police Department did not reinstate Gonzalez as an active police officer, a fact that he publicly expressed resentment over, and subsequently threatened to provide incriminating evidence to the media about other individuals involved in the shootings unless reinstated.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Oran fatwa, the {{predominant}} position of Islamic scholars {{had been that}} a Muslim could not stay {{in a country where}} rulers made proper religious observance impossible. Therefore, a Muslim's obligation was to leave, when they were able to do so. Even before the systematic forcible conversion, religious leaders <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Muslims in Christian territory would be subject to direct and indirect pressure, and preached emigration as a way to protect the religion from erosion. Notably, the contemporary North African scholar Ahmad al-Wansharisi, who was considered the leading authority on the subject of Muslims in Spain, wrote in 1491 that emigrating from Christian to Muslim lands was compulsory in almost all circumstances. Further, Al-Wansharisi urged severe punishment for the Muslims who remained and predicted that they would temporarily dwell in hell in the afterlife.|$|E
5|$|The Wall Street Crash of 1929 {{occurred}} {{only weeks}} after the building was completed. At that time more than 80% of the apartments were rented and some 300 students had signed up to take classes at the Institute. However, both rentals and student fees were soon depleted, and the nonprofit corporation that ran the building was unable to meet its payments. On April 6, 1932, this organization was sued for nonpayment of taxes and sinking fund payments due on the mortgage bonds. At {{that time it was}} alleged that the building was being mismanaged, the principal evidence offered being the provision of free living quarters to the Roeriches and their followers. Horch successfully contested the suit partly on a technicality and partly by explaining that the 20 rooms occupied rent-free were used by management as partial compensation to employees of the corporation. Representatives of the bond holders <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the parts of the building that did not produce rental income—that is the museum, institute, and other cultural spaces—should be converted to apartments but Horch successfully countered that the museum et al. were an asset that generated a substantial tax exemption and that, in normal times, they led to higher rental rates from the existing apartments than would comparable apartments. He also pointed out that the demanded conversion would be expensive (about $100,000). In June 1932, the foreclosure case ended with Horch being named one of two receivers tasked with clearing the building's debts.|$|E
25|$|The proper arsenic MCL {{continues}} to be debated. Some <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the 10 ppb federal standard is still too high, while others <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> 10 ppb is needlessly strict. Individual states are able to establish lower arsenic limits; New Jersey has done so, setting a maximum of 0.005mg/L for arsenic in drinking water.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> finding {{should not}} be a {{province}} for the criminal law system but that any dispute as to ownership be left to resolution via a civil suit. Others <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the jurisprudence gives rise to legal fictions and strained reasoning which has attracted divergent statutory law reform in different jurisdictions.|$|R
50|$|Many {{scholars}} <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Fletcher's sympathies seem to lie {{more with}} the Romans than the Britons, though it <b>has</b> also been <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the play constantly parallels the two sides.|$|R
25|$|In 1940, {{the first}} {{electron}} micrograph of a bacteriophage was published and this silenced sceptics who <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> bacteriophages were relatively simple enzymes and not viruses.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{considered}} whether Reynolds {{could use}} religious belief or {{duty as a}} defense. Reynolds <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> as a Mormon, it was his religious duty as a male member {{of the church to}} practice polygamy if possible.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, Ashcroft was {{narrowly}} defeated {{for election}} to that post by Jackson County County Executive George W. Lehr. He <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Ashcroft, {{who is not}} an accountant, was not qualified to be the State Auditor.|$|E
50|$|It <b>has</b> been <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{the lack}} of uniform {{protection}} against SLAPPs has encouraged forum shopping; proponents of federal legislation <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the uncertainty about one's level of protection has likely magnified the chilling effect of SLAPPs.|$|R
