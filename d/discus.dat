5|$|<b>Discus</b> {{is one of}} {{the events}} where the athlete has to throw a heavy disc in the attempt to mark a farther {{distance}} than their competitors. As one of the events within the ancient pentathlon, the history of the <b>discus</b> throw dates back to 708 BC. In ancient times a heavy circular disc was thrown from a set standing position on a small pedestal, and it was this style that was revived for the 1896 Olympics. This continued until the 1906 Intercalated Games in Athens, which featured both the ancient style and the increasingly popular modern style of turning and throwing. By the 1912 Olympics, the ancient standing throw style had fallen into disuse and contests starting within a 2.5m squared throwing area became the standard. The <b>discus</b> implement was standardised to 2kg (4.4pounds) in weight and 22cm (8inches) in diameter in 1907. The women's <b>discus</b> was among the first women's events on the Olympic programme, being introduced in 1928., although they had been competing at some national and regional levels previously.The first modern athlete to throw the <b>discus</b> while rotating the whole body was Czech athlete Frantisek Janda-Suk. He invented the technique when studying the position of the famous statue of Discobolus.|$|E

The 17th place finalist in the second qualifying heat, Iraq's Haidar Nasser Shaheed, threw 1.08meters further, with heat leader Rutger Smith of the Netherlands throwing the <b>discus</b> 12.54meters further than Matthias.
