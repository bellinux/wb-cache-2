5|$|Oryzomys dimidiatus is now {{recognized}} as one of eight species in the genus Oryzomys. O.dimidiatus is further part of the O.couesi section, which <b>is</b> <b>centered</b> <b>on</b> the widespread Central American O.couesi and also includes six other species with more limited and peripheral distributions. O.couesi occurs with O.dimidiatus in southeastern Nicaragua. Many aspects of the systematics of the O.couesi section remain unclear and {{it is likely that the}} current classification underestimates the true diversity of the group. Oryzomys is classified in the tribe Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), a diverse assemblage of American rodents of over a hundred species, and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of family Cricetidae, along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents.|$|E

The work <b>is</b> <b>centered</b> <b>on</b> the production of news and photo releases that highlight interesting Hubble results and images. These are often European in origin, and so increase awareness of both ESA's Hubble share (15%) and the contribution of European scientists to the observatory.

5|$|Study of the H. pylori genome <b>is</b> <b>centered</b> <b>on</b> {{attempts}} to understand pathogenesis, {{the ability of}} this organism to cause disease. About 29% of the loci have acolonization defectwhen mutated. Two of sequenced strains have an around 40-kb-long Cag pathogenicity island (a common gene sequence believed responsible for pathogenesis) that contains over 40 genes. This pathogenicity island is usually absent from H. pylori strains isolated from humans who are carriers of H. pylori but remain asymptomatic.|$|E
5|$|The Hemingway scholar Allen Josephs {{thinks the}} novel <b>is</b> <b>centered</b> <b>on</b> the corrida (the bullfighting), and how each {{character}} reacts to it.

The corrida is presented as an idealized drama in which the matador faces death, creating a moment of existentialism or nada (nothingness), broken when he vanquishes death by killing the bull.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{classification}} by Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, Oryzomys antillarum {{is one of}} eight species in the genus Oryzomys, which occurs from the eastern United States (O.palustris) into northwestern South America (O.gorgasi). O.antillarum is further part of the O.couesi section, which <b>is</b> <b>centered</b> <b>on</b> the widespread Central American O.couesi and also includes various other species with more limited and peripheral distributions. Many aspects of the systematics of the O.couesi section remain unclear {{and it is likely}} that the current classification underestimates the true diversity of the group. Oryzomys previously included many other species, which were progressively removed in various studies culminating in the 2006 paper by Weksler and colleagues, which excluded more than forty species from the genus. All are classified in the tribe Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), a diverse assemblage of American rodents of over a hundred species, and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of family Cricetidae, along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents.|$|E
5|$|Like its {{predecessors}} in the Tony Hawk's series, Underground <b>is</b> <b>centered</b> <b>on</b> skateboarding {{in a series}} of levels. The player performs tricks via combinations of analog stick and button inputs. For example, the player initiates an ollie (a jump trick) by holding and releasing the jump button. During an ollie, the player may change the position of the analog stick and press one of two buttons to perform either a flip trick (such as an impossible or kickflip) or a grab trick (such as a benihana or nosegrab). The player can grind on certain edges and rails; different tricks may be performed during a grind based on the position of the analog stick. On quarter pipes, the player may execute lip tricks. While skating on flat surfaces, the player may manual in multiple ways via button combinations. Miscellaneous tricks include acid drops and wall-rides.|$|E
