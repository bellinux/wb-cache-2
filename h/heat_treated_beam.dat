The morphology, composition and type of transient oxide(s) formed after heat treatment were characterised using scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD). All samples exhibited the formation of a top layer of discrete or island like Ni rich oxide in cellular shaped alumina. The alumina layer, although difficult to be detected in cross-section, was very dense and covered most of the coating surface. The transisent oxide formation on the <b>heat</b> <b>treated</b> surfaces was further analysed using XRD and 3 ̆b 1 -Al 2 O 3 was detected on all <b>heat</b> <b>treated</b> samples in addition to NiO and possible spinel.
