In addition to his administrative responsibilities, Dr. Crecine held a joint appointment as tenured professor in the new School of International Affairs, and the School of <b>Industrial</b> <b>and</b> <b>Systems</b> <b>Engineering.</b> During his tenure, he initiated the establishment of three new colleges at Tech: the College of Computing (the first such college in the country); the Ivan Allen College of Management, Policy, and International Affairs; and the College of Sciences. He also served as Chairman of the Georgia Tech Athletic Association and as President of the Georgia Tech Research Corporation. During his tenure as President, the College of Engineering's ranking climbed from 14th to 9th in the country, the institution was transformed from a specialized institution to a top-30 national university, SAT scores of Fall entering freshmen for 1992, 1993, and 1994 rose to become the highest of any public research university in the U.S., graduation rates increased by nearly 12 percent, student facilities and housing (including those under construction) were doubled {{from those of the}} previous 102 years of the institution’s existence, and sponsored research awards more than doubled.|$|E

The center is creating models of country level logistics capabilities that will support the decision-making process for future investments and trade opportunities in the growing region [...] and has established dual degree programs in the University of Panama and other Panamanian universities with Georgia Tech. A similar center in Singapore, The Centre for Next Generation Logistics, was established in 2015 and is a collaboration between Georgia Tech and the National University of Singapore. The Center will work closely with government agencies and the industry to perform research in logistics and supply chain systems for translation into innovations and commercialization to achieve transformative economic and societal impact.|$|E
2500|$|The {{idea of the}} {{production}} line has been used multiple times in history prior to Henry Ford: the Venetian Arsenal (1104); Smith's pin manufacturing, in the Wealth of Nations (1776) or Brunel's Portsmouth Block Mills (1802). Ransom Olds {{was the first to}} manufacture cars using the assembly line system, but Henry Ford developed the first auto assembly system where a car chassis was moved through the assembly line by a conveyor belt while workers added components to it until the car was completed. During World War II, the growth of computing power led to further development of efficient manufacturing methods and the use of advanced mathematical and statistical tools. This was supported by the development of academic programs in <b>industrial</b> <b>and</b> <b>systems</b> <b>engineering</b> disciplines, as well as fields of operations research and management science (as multi-disciplinary fields of problem solving). While systems engineering concentrated on the broad characteristics of the relationships between inputs and outputs of generic systems, operations researchers concentrated on solving specific and focused problems. The synergy of operations research and systems engineering allowed for the realization of solving large scale and complex problems in the modern era. Recently, the development of faster and smaller computers, intelligent systems, and the World Wide Web [...] has opened new opportunities for operations, manufacturing, production, and service systems.|$|E

The agent-based modeling approach is different from traditional equation-based modeling approach in many aspects. As the agent-based modeling approach has recently become an attractive and efficient way for modeling large-scale complex systems, there are few formalized validation methodologies existing for model validation. In our proposed work, we design, develop, adapt, and apply various verification and validation techniques to an agent-based scientific model and investigate the sufficiency of these techniques for the validation of agent-based models. ...|$|R
