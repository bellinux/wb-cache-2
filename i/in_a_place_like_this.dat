One of her film professors asked Schoonmaker to help Scorsese; a close working relationship with him unfolded over the next thirty-five years. Schoonmaker edited Scorsese's first feature film, Who's That Knocking at My Door (1967).|$|E
25|$|Scorsese {{attended}} New York University's Tisch School of the Arts (B.A., English, 1964; M.F.A., film, 1966) {{making the}} short films What's a Nice Girl Like You Doing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Place</b> <b>Like</b> <b>This?</b> (1963) and It's Not Just You, Murray! (1964). His most famous {{short of the}} period is the darkly comic The Big Shave (1967), which features Peter Bernuth. The film is an indictment of America's involvement in Vietnam, suggested by its alternative title Viet '67. Scorsese has mentioned on several occasions that he was greatly inspired in his early days at New York University by his Armenian American film professor Haig P. Manoogian.|$|E
500|$|The couple {{viewed the}} Loew's State {{engagement}} in 1937 as Skelton's big chance. They hired New York comedy writers to prepare {{material for the}} engagement, believing they needed more sophisticated jokes and skits than the routines Skelton normally performed. However, his New York audience did not laugh or applaud until Skelton abandoned the newly written material and began performing the [...] "Doughnut Dunkers" [...] and his older routines. The doughnut-dunking routine also helped Skelton rise to celebrity status. In 1937, while he was entertaining at the Capitol Theater in Washington, D.C., President Franklin D. Roosevelt invited Skelton to perform at a White House luncheon. During one of the official toasts, Skelton grabbed Roosevelt's glass, saying, [...] "Careful what you drink, Mr. President. [...] I got rolled <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> once." [...] His humor appealed to FDR and Skelton became the master of ceremonies for Roosevelt's official birthday celebration for many years afterward.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{was always}} a chapel man; but--I don't know how it is--there's {{something}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> that makes church seem more--more suitable; my wife always had a leaning that way. I never conceal my actions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, look here, it's rot. You {{must keep}} your end up <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> or {{everybody}} in the house'll be ragging you. Chaps will, naturally, play the goat if you let them. Has this ever happened before?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You're sure-enough women, I can see that.

6000|$|... "That {{would be}} much better," [...] Dick said. [...] "Let us go and get them, at once. There must be plenty of horses for sale <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> and, as we are both flush of money, I should think {{that a couple of}} hours would do it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Aren't {{we going}} to wait----?"
