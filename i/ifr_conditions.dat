50|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{launched}} an extensive investigation upon {{the location of}} the wreckage. Its conclusions were as follows:The accident was caused by the deviation from the prescribed route of flight, as authorized in the company's FAA-approved operations specifications, resulting in the aircraft being operated under <b>IFR</b> weather <b>conditions,</b> in high mountainous terrain, in an area where {{there was a lack of}} radio navigation aids.

40|$|An {{implicit}} model-following {{flight controller}} is proposed. This controller is relatively simple in concept: {{it provides an}} input/output relationship that is approximately that of any selected second order system; it provides good gust alleviation; and it is self-trimming. The flight controller was applied to all axes of a comprehensive mathematical model of a lift-fan V/STOL transport. Power management controls and displays were designed to match the various modes of control provided by the flight controller. A piloted simulation was performed using a six degree of freedom simulator. The fixed-operating-point handling qualities throughout the powered lift flight envelope received pilot ratings of 3 - 1 / 2 or better. Approaches and vertical landings in <b>IFR</b> zero-zero <b>conditions</b> received pilot ratings varying from 2 - 1 / 2 to 4 {{depending on the type}} of approach and weather conditions...|$|R

Evaluation flights were conducted in negligible and moderate turbulence {{for a wide range}} of short-term frequencies and dampings. The results were compared with the short-term requirements of MIL-F- 83300. The specified Level 1 and 2 VFR boundaries were found to be approximately valid in moderate turbulence for both VFR and <b>IFR</b> flight <b>conditions.</b> In negligible turbulence, the specified VFR Level 2 boundary was also approximately valid but the Level 1 boundary was found to be too stringent.

50|$|It is {{essential}} to differentiate between flight plan type (VFR or <b>IFR)</b> and weather <b>conditions</b> (VMC or IMC). While current and forecast weather may {{be a factor in}} deciding which type of flight plan to file, weather conditions themselves do not affect one's filed flight plan. For example, an IFR flight that encounters visual meteorological conditions (VMC) en route does not automatically change to a VFR flight, and the flight must still follow all IFR procedures regardless of weather conditions. In the US, weather conditions are forecast broadly as VFR, MVFR (Marginal Visual Flight Rules), IFR, or LIFR (Low Instrument Flight Rules).|$|R
40|$|It is {{desirable}} that the landing approach of helicopters and V/STOL aircraft into a congested airport {{equipped with a}} microwave landing system (MLS) can take place essentially independent of CTOL traffic.

A helical descent {{makes it possible for}} the helicopter to lose altitude in a confined airspace without descending along an excessively steep glide slope. This avoids helicopter handling problems which occur at slow airspeeds. Preliminary flight-test data are presented regarding the operational feasibility of the helical approach under <b>IFR</b> <b>conditions</b> where the primary guidance information is from an MLS...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} make full use of the helicopter's unique {{capability}} of remote-site, off-airport landings, it would be desirable to employ a self-contained navigation system requiring minimum groundable-based equipment. For this reason, research is being conducted with the aim to develop the use of airborne weather radar as a primary navigation aid for helicopter approach and landing in instrument flight rules (<b>IFR)</b> <b>conditions.</b> Anderson et al.

An increase in fixation dwell times, especially on the primary instrument with increased mental loading is indicated. Skilled subjects 'stared' less under increased loading than did novice pilots. Sequences of instrument fixations were also examined. The percentage occurrence of the subject's most used sequences decreased with increased task difficulty for novice subjects but not for highly skilled subjects. Entropy rate (bits/sec) of the sequence of fixations was also used to quantify the scan pattern. It consistently decreased for most subjects as the four loading levels used increased...|$|E

The study was performed utilizing a large multiengine jet airplane having geometric characteristics fairly representative of the jet transports; however, to insure general applicability of the results, the aerodynamic characteristics of the test airplane were varied to simulate a variety of jet-transport airplanes. The specific areas investigated include those of the take-off and landing, and the relation of these maneuvers to the 1 g stall speed and stalling characteristics. The take-off studies included evaluation of the factors affecting the take-off speed and attitude, including the effects of premature rotation and of over-rotation on ground run required. The approach and landing studies pertained to such factors as: desirable lateral-directional damping characteristics; lateral-control requirements; space-positioning limitations during approach under VFR or <b>IFR</b> <b>conditions</b> and requirements for glide-path controls; and evaluation of factors affecting the pilot's choice of landing speeds.

40|$|Several recent {{experiments}} involving relativistic {{electron beam}} (REB) transport in plasma channels show two density regimes for efficient transport; a low‐density regime known as the ion‐focused regime (IFR) and a high‐pressure regime. The results obtained in this paper use three separate models to explain the dependency of REB transport efficiency on the plasma density in the <b>IFR.</b> <b>Conditions</b> for efficient beam transport are determined by examining equilibrium solutions of the Vlasov–Maxwell equations under conditions relevant to IFR transport. The dynamic force balance required for efficient IFR transport is studied using the particle‐in‐cell (PIC) method. These simulations provide new insight into the transient beam front physics {{as well as the}} dynamic approach to IFR equilibrium. Nonlinear solutions to the beam envelope are constructed to explain oscillations in the beam envelope observed in the PIC simulations but not contained in the Vlasov equilibrium analysis. A test particle analysis is also developed as a method to visualize equilibrium solutions of the Vlasov equation. This not only provides further insight into the transport mechanism but also illustrates the connections between the three theories used to describe IFR transport. Separately these models provide valuable information about transverse beam confinement; together they provide a clear physical understanding of REB transport in the IFR...|$|E
40|$|WIND- 3 is an {{application}} for aviation weather forecasting that uses the analog method to produce deterministic predictions of cloud ceiling height and horizontal visibility at airports.
