40|$|The {{mechanism}} for L-lactate transport across microvillous membrane vesicles prepared from rat placenta was examined. Uptake of L-lactate into these vesicles was mainly {{the result of}} transport into the intravesicular (osmotically active) space. The initial rate of L-lactate uptake was not affected {{by the presence of}} an inward gradient of either Na+ or K+. In the presence of an inward-directed proton gradient, L-lactate uptake was markedly stimulated, accumulating at concentrations 6 - 7 -fold higher than the equilibrium. Lower transmembrane pH gradients were associated with slower <b>initial</b> <b>uptakes</b> and smaller overshoots. L-Lactate uptake determined under an inside-directed pH gradient was strongly inhibited by p-chloromercuriphenylsulphonic acid, a protein-thiol oxidizing agent.

Methods: PET scans of 8 healthy volunteers were acquired at time points up to 4 h after a bolus injection of 18 F-AH 111585. 18 F activity in whole blood and plasma and excreted urine were measured up to 4 h after injection. In vivo 18 F activities in up to 12 source regions were determined from quantitative analysis of the images.

50|$|<b>Initial</b> <b>uptake</b> of UHF {{television}} was very slow: Differing propagation characteristics between VHF and UHF meant new additional transmitters {{needed to be}} built, often at different locations to the then-established VHF sites, and in general with {{a larger number of}} relay stations to fill the greater number of gaps in coverage that came with the new band. This led to poor picture quality in bad coverage areas, and many years before the service achieved full national coverage. In addition to this, the only exclusively UHF service, BBC2, would run for only a few hours a day and run alternative programming for minority audiences in contrast to the more populist schedules of BBC1 and ITV. However the 1970s saw a large increase in UHF TV viewing while VHF took a significant decline: The appeal of colour, which was never introduced to VHF (despite preliminary plans {{to do so in the}} late 1950s and early 1960s) and the fall in television prices saw most households use a UHF set by the end of that decade.

The <b>initial</b> <b>uptake</b> of glycylsarcosine and cefadroxil by rat renal basolateral membrane vesicles was inhibited {{by the presence}} of all the di- and tripeptides and β-lactam antibiotics that were tested in this study. However, the uptake of both substrates was not inhibited by glycine, an amino acid. The <b>initial</b> <b>uptake</b> of zwitterionic β-lactam antibiotics, cefadroxil, cephradine, and cephalexin, was stimulated by preloaded glycylsarcosine (countertransport effect).

A concentration-dependent <b>initial</b> <b>uptake</b> of glycylsarcosine and cefadroxil suggested the existence of a carrier-mediated mechanism, whereas the {{transport of}} ceftibuten did not show any saturated uptake.

40|$|A model {{analysis}} {{of the process of}} carrier mediated membrane transport is presented, wherein the carrier is present in two forms of differing affinity for substrate.

These expressions are applied to published data for glycine transport in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells to obtain numerical values for the parameters of a concentrative membrane carrier system.

40|$|International audienceMineral aerosol is of {{interest}} due to its physiochemical impacts on the Earth's atmosphere. However, adsorbed organics could influence the chemical and physical properties of atmospheric mineral particles and alter {{their impact on the}} biosphere and climate. In this work, the heterogeneous uptake of a series of small organic acids on the swelling clay, Na-montmorillonite, was studied at 212 K as a function of relative humidity (RH), organic acid pressure and clay mass. A high vacuum chamber equipped with a quadrupole mass spectrometer and a transmission Fourier transform infrared spectrometer was used to detect the gas and condensed phases, respectively. Our results show that while the <b>initial</b> <b>uptake</b> efficiency was found to be independent of organic acid pressure, it increased linearly with increasing clay mass. Thus, the small masses studied allow access to the entire surface area of the clay sample with minimal effects due to surface saturation. Additionally, results from this study show that the <b>initial</b> <b>uptake</b> efficiency for butanoic (butyric) acid on the clay increases by an order of magnitude as the RH is raised from 0 % to 45 % RH at 212 K while the <b>initial</b> <b>uptake</b> efficiency of formic, acetic and propanoic (propionic) acids increases only slightly at higher humidities. However, the <b>initial</b> <b>uptake</b> efficiency decreases significantly in {{a short amount of time}} due to surface saturation effects. Thus, although the <b>initial</b> <b>uptake</b> efficiencies are appropriate for initial times, the fact that the uptake efficiency will decrease over time as the surface saturates should be considered in atmospheric models. Surface saturation results in sub-monolayer coverage of organic acid on montmorillonite under dry conditions and relevant organic acid pressures that increases with increasing humidity for all organic acids studied. Additionally, the presence of large organic acids may slightly enhance the water content of the clay above 45 % RH. Our results indicate that heterogeneous uptake of organic acids on swelling clay minerals provides an important irreversible heterogeneous sink for these species...|$|E

At 5 °C (body temperature of a hibernating mammal) uptake is appreciable in kidney cortex of both species.
