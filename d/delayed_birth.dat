50|$|The {{so-called}} charm for <b>delayed</b> <b>birth</b> is an Old English poetic medical text {{found in}} the manuscript London, British Library, Harley 585, ff. 185r-v, {{in a collection of}} medical texts known since the nineteenth century as Lacnunga (‘remedies’). The manuscript was probably copied in the early eleventh century, though its sources may have been older.|$|E
50|$|The Lacnunga {{contains}} many unique texts, including numerous charms, {{some of which}} provide rare glimpses into Anglo-Saxon popular religion and healing practices. Among the charms are several incantations in Old English alliterative verse, the most famous being those known as For <b>Delayed</b> <b>Birth,</b> the Nine Herbs Charm and Wið færstice ('Against a sudden, stabbing pain'). There are also several charms in corrupt Old Irish.|$|E

50|$|The {{mainland}} form, Macropus rufogriseus banksianus, breeds {{all year}} round.

25|$|At present, {{there is}} no way to stop twins being born early. In women with single pregnancies drugs called betamimetics can relax the muscles of the uterus and <b>delay</b> <b>birth.</b> Giving betamimetics can give more time to give steroids, for the baby’s lung development, or to {{transfer}} the mother to a hospital with a special care unit.|$|R
50|$|There {{are short}} verses {{found in the}} margins of manuscripts which offer {{practical}} advice, such as remedies against the loss of cattle or how to deal with a <b>delayed</b> <b>birth,</b> often grouped as charms. The longest is called Nine Herbs Charm and is probably of pagan origin. Other similar short verses, or charms, include For a Swarm of Bees, Against a Dwarf, Against a Stabbing Pain, and Against a Wen.|$|E
50|$|The text {{is in fact}} a set {{of prose}} {{instructions}} which include a series of short poems which should be recited as part of the ritual. The text is an important witness to non-orthodox Anglo-Saxon Christian religious practice and to women's history: it is unique among Anglo-Saxon medical texts for being explicitly for use and recitation by a woman. However, 'this charm is perhaps misnamed, because it deals, not with <b>delayed</b> <b>birth</b> as such, but with the inability of the wifman woman for whom it is written to conceive at all, or to bring a child to term without miscarriage.'Considered by early scholarship to be a single charm for a single situation, this is actually composed of a number of charms for different situations, though all involve the desire for a successful pregnancy.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a simultaneous {{analysis of the}} timing of births and labor market transitions {{of women in the}} Netherlands. The results show that an increase in the years of schooling of a woman causes her to schedule births later in life but it does not significantly affect her completed fertility. Moreover, the effects of an increase in schooling on the timing of births mainly have an impact through changes in female employment status: a more highly educated woman is more likely to move into employment and, consequently, to <b>delay</b> <b>births.</b> We show that ignoring the endogeneity of fertility results in an underestimation of the effects of schooling on lifecycle female employment. Unobserved heterogeneity, interpreted as preferences over work and children, turns out to be of major empirical importance. Women with a higher preference of work over children have significantly higher employment rates at all ages, <b>delay</b> <b>births</b> and have a significant lower level of completed fertility. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|AbstractWe {{propose a}} non-local PDE {{model for the}} {{evolution}} of a single species population that involves delayed feedback, where the delay such as the maturation time in the <b>delayed</b> <b>birth</b> rate, is selective and the selection depends on the status of the system.

We explore a process with the opposite selection rule, in which the biggest clusters of the randomly chosen ones merge together. We develop a theory {{of this kind of}} percolation based on the Smoluchowski equation, find the percolation threshold, and describe the scaling properties of this continuous transition, namely, the critical exponents and amplitudes, and scaling functions. We show that, qualitatively, this transition is similar to the ordinary percolation one, though occurring in less connected systems. Comment: 6 pages, 2 figure...|$|E

Methods: A qualitative retrospective case record review, of patients with intellectual disability, visiting psychiatry department of a tertiary care hospital, within a period of one year, was conducted to assess their epidemiological and clinical profile. Results: Patients with Intellectual disability are brought to the hospital at all ages and commonly by their parents. Etiologically related various peri-natal factors (<b>delayed</b> <b>birth</b> cry and seizures being most common) as well as childhood medical conditions (epilepsy and recurrent respiratory/GI infections being most common) were commonly found in these patients.

40|$|Empirical {{evidence}} strongly {{indicates that}} human exploitation has frequently led to rapid evolutionary changes in wild populations, yet the mechanisms involved are often poorly understood. Here, we applied a recently developed demographic framework for analyzing selection {{to data from}} a 20 -year study of a wild population of moose, Alces alces. In this population, a genetic pedigree has been established {{all the way back}} to founders. We demonstrate harvest-induced directional selection for <b>delayed</b> <b>birth</b> dates in males and reduced body mass as calf in females. During the study period, birth date was delayed by 0. 81 days per year for both sexes, whereas no significant changes occurred in calf body mass.

These results show that selective harvesting can induce strong selection that oppose natural selection.

40|$|ABSTRACT. A recent {{decrease}} in the George River caribou herd ecruitment was caused both by an increasing calf winter mortality since 1977 {{and an increase in}} their summer mortality since 1984. A reduction in pregnancy rate could also be partly responsible for a decline in gross recruitment. Evaluation of net recruitment shows that the rate of increase of the herd has been negative since 1984. The probable causes of the decline involve the negative effects and interrelation of various factors: decline of the physical condition of females, habitat deterioration on the current calving grounds (former summer range), increase in energy expendituI'es related to more extensive movements, <b>delayed</b> <b>birth</b> dates, increase in density within their range and especially on calving rounds, increase in wolf populations and exceptionally high snow accumulation during the 1980 - 81 winter.

40|$|Ongoing {{anatomical}} development typically {{results in}} a gradual maturation of the feeding movements from larval to adult fishes. Adult seahorses are known to capture prey by rotating their longsnouted head extremely quickly towards prey, followed by powerful suction. This type of suction is powered by elastic recoil and requires very precise coordination of {{the movements of the}} associated feeding structures, making it an all-or-none phenomenon. Here, we show that newborn Hippocampus reidi are able to successfully feed using an extremely rapid and powerful snout rotation combined with a high-volume suction, surpassing that observed in adult seahorses. An inverse dynamic analysis shows that an elastic recoil mechanism is also used to power head rotation in newborn H. reidi. This illustrates how extreme levels of performance in highly complex musculoskeletal systems can be present at birth given a <b>delayed</b> <b>birth</b> and rapid development of functionally important structures. The fact that the head skeleton of newborn seahorses is still largely cartilaginous may not be problematic because the hydrodynamic stress on the rotating snout appeared considerably lower than in adult syngnathids...|$|E
