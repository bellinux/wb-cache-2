The vote was split along party lines and was thus defeated, but Dunstan used the opportunity to attack the Playmander with much effect in the media, portraying the failed legislation as an unjust triumph of a malapportioned minority who had a vengeance mentality over an electorally repressed majority who wanted a humane outcome.|$|E

5|$|After the LCL lost {{government}} in 1970, primarily {{owing to the}} electoral reform, Hall managed to be re-elected as leader.

When the Dunstan government again <b>introduced</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> to introduce universal suffrage to the council, Hall gained the support of 7 out of 20 members in the Assembly, but only 2 of 16 LCL members in the Legislative Council supported the bill. Internally, there was much opposition to any electoral reform when the matter was debated at party conferences.|$|E

5|$|Moran {{introduced}} and supported legislation to increase benefits {{and pay for}} federal workers, {{in part due to}} the Federal Governmentâ€™s large presence within the 8th District â€“ 114,000 federal employees work within its bounds. He <b>introduced</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> signed into law that allows FERS employees to buy back credit from a lapse in federal service toward annuity payments, with the goal of attracting individuals from the private sector back to public service. Moran also authored a law that allows a federal workerâ€™s unused sick leave to count toward their annuity. In the 112th Congress, he also spoke against attempts by Republicans to cut back the size of the federal workforce.|$|E
5|$|On February 10, 1798, Garrard's son William, still {{serving in}} the state senate, <b>introduced</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> to hold another vote on calling a {{constitutional}} convention.
