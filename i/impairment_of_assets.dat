5000|$|An Impairment cost must be {{included}} under expenses when the book value of an asset exceeds the recoverable amount. <b>Impairment</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> is the diminishing in quality, strength amount, or value of an asset.

50|$|The term is {{important}} to financial risk management {{in order to avoid}} economic loss after an asset has been converted to a liability. Accountants have measures to deal with the <b>impairment</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> (e.g. IAS 16) which seek to ensure that an entity’s assets are not carried at more than their recoverable amount. In this context, stranded assets are also defined as an asset that has become obsolete or non-performing, but must be recorded on the balance sheet as a loss of profit.|$|E

40|$|The {{principle}} of prudence in accounting {{is one of several}} generally accepted accounting principles. The need of prudence principle arises from the fact that an accounting entities are often found in situations in which they must deal with certain risks and uncertainties. The basic purpose of this principle is to not to overvalue assets and revenues and also not to undervalue liabilities and expenses. Prudence principle is realized mainly through these instruments: provisions, <b>impairment</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> and depreciation of assets. This bachelor work focuses on the description of provisions and <b>impairment</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets.</b> Its aim is also to describe the provisions and <b>impairment</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> in terms of both the Czech accounting legislation and IAS/IFRS and outline the basic differences between these legislative accounting regulations...|$|E

40|$|Prior to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121 (SFAS No. 121) : Accounting for the <b>Impairment</b> <b>of</b> Long-Lived <b>Assets</b> and Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, {{managers}} had substantial discretion {{concerning the}} amount and timing of reporting writedowns <b>of</b> long-lived <b>assets.</b> Moreover, the frequency and dollar amount <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> writedown announcements {{that led to a}} large “surprise” caused the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to consider the need for a new standard to guide the recording <b>of</b> <b>impairment</b> <b>of</b> long-lived <b>assets.</b> This study has two primary objectives. First, it investigates the effects of SFAS No. 121 on asset impairment reporting, examining whether SFAS No. 121 reduces the magnitude and restricts the timing <b>of</b> reporting <b>asset</b> writedowns. Second, the study compares the information content (surprise element) <b>of</b> the <b>asset</b> <b>impairment</b> loss announcement as measured by cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) before and after the issuance of SFAS No. 121. The findings provide support for the hypothesis that the FASB's new accounting standard does not affect the magnitude <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> writedown losses. The findings also provide support for the hypothesis that SFAS No. 121 does not affect the management choice of the timing for reporting asset writedowns. In addition, the findings suggest that the market evaluates the asset writedown losses after the issuance of SFAS No. 121 as good news for “big bath” firms, while, for “income smoothing” firms, the market does not respond to the announcements <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> writedown losses either before or after the issuance of SFAS No. 121. The findings also suggest that, for “big bath” firms, the market perceives the announcement <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> <b>impairment</b> losses after the adoption of SFAS No. 121 as more credible relative to that before its issuance. This could be because the practice <b>of</b> reporting <b>asset</b> writedowns after the issuance of SFAS No. 121 is under the FASB's authoritative guidance, which brings consistency and comparability in asset impairment reporting...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to launch a {{discussion}} on the general treatment of provisions and <b>impairment</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> in the National Accounts, in the context of the review of the SNA. The paper argues that the SNA should recognize the provisions and <b>impairment</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> that are recognised by business accounting standards, instead of, as currently, rejecting these items outside the scope of the accounts. The paper proposes the creation of new lines in the sequence of account, located just before the balance sheet accounts, where the SNA would record changes in provisions and <b>impairment</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets.</b> Also, the stock of provisions and <b>impairment</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> would be available in the annual balance sheet accounts. Both these pieces of information would come as an additional information to the existing tables. Far from being a revolution, this proposal would simply allow users to compile alternative values for the net worth of institutional sectors, including or excluding these items. One specific property of this additional information is that the tables would not be fully symmetrical. It is a small price to pay compared to the advantage of extending the scope of the SNA to these important accounting entries. By including these categories into the framework of the SNA, a new flexibility is introduced which will, first, help to clarify the treatment of some transactions and, more important, allow producers of national accounts to elaborate macro-economic information on “quasi-liabilities ” and “quasi-assets”, in particula...|$|E
40|$|This master's {{thesis is}} focused on a {{prudence}} principle under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) a US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP) in accounting of a reporting unit. In the first part I described the prudence principle (conservatism principle) in the general way. In {{the second part of}} this thesis I introduced impairment testing, recognition of <b>impairment</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> and reversal of previously recognized <b>impairment</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> under IAS 36 <b>Impairment</b> <b>of</b> <b>Assets.</b> It is obviously focused on recoverable amount as a fair value less costs to sell and value in use, methods of the fair value valuation, computing value in use and identifying the appropriate discount rate to apply expected future cash flows. Third chapter of this master's thesis, named "Provisions under IAS 37 ", is dealing with relation between provisions and contingent liabilities, initial liability measurement and subsequent applying IAS 37. There are also stated disclosure requirements under IAS 37 (as well as under IAS 36).

40|$|International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) were {{developed}} to be a single set of high-quality globally accepted accounting standards.

The objective of the dissertation is to study whether the application of IFRSs is consistent across companies and countries; in particular we tackle the following two questions: -Does the application of IFRSs in the preparation of financial statements lead to consistency? -Does the public enforcement of accounting standards impact the consistent application of IFRSs? To answer the first question we have addressed standard IAS 36 that was developed by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and covering <b>impairment</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets.</b> We found that managers’ opportunism still has an impact on the <b>impairment</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> recognition and magnitude when taking impairment decisions. To address the second question, a survey covering enforcement of accounting standards activities was prepared and sent to public enforcement bodies in a number of countries mandating the adoption of IFRSs.

We studied the impact of public enforcement on specific applications of the standards, the results show a decrease in earnings management in countries with effective public enforcement...|$|E
