5000|$|An <b>intramolecular</b> <b>force</b> is any {{force that}} holds {{together}} the atoms {{making up a}} molecule or compound. [...] They contain all types of chemical bonds. They are usually stronger than intermolecular forces, which are present between atoms or molecules that are not bonded. Hydrogen bonds are an important case of forces that can be either intramolecular or intermolecular.|$|E
40|$|The DNA {{is treated}} using the discretized wormlike bead-chain model, where each “bead” {{represents}} a 3 nm segment of relaxed DNA (1, 2). Each bead is assigned a salt-dependent charge qdna according to Stigter (3). The DNA bead-chain is also assigned an <b>intramolecular</b> <b>force</b> field comprising of stretching, bending, twisting terms that capture {{all aspects of}} DN...|$|E

5000|$|In the past, chemism {{referred}} to <b>intramolecular</b> <b>forces</b> between atoms, or more generally, any forces acting on atoms and molecules. [...] It is now typically superseded by more precise {{terms such as}} hydrogen interaction.|$|R
50|$|Strong {{chemical}} {{bonds are}} the <b>intramolecular</b> <b>forces</b> which hold atoms together in molecules. A strong chemical bond is formed from the transfer or sharing of electrons between atomic centers and {{relies on the}} electrostatic attraction between the protons in nuclei and the electrons in the orbitals.|$|R
40|$|The gas-phase {{protonation}} {{mechanism of}} ferrocene is investigated using an effective potential describing electrostatic, polarization and short-range repulsion energy components. The {{parameters of the}} potential are deduced from a least-squares fit to energy profiles calculated using local-spin density or Hartree—Fock methods. It is shown that this model, which provides a clear physical interpretation, leads to a good description of this reaction mechanism. In addition, a molecular dynamics simulation of ferrocene based on an <b>intramolecular</b> <b>force</b> field developed in this work is presented...|$|E
40|$|A simple force {{constant}} model is described {{and applied to}} the vibrations of crystalline acetylene, C 2 H 2 and C 2 D 2 in its low temperature orthorhombic phase. The model uses ten (six intermolecular and four intramolecular) adjustable parameters to calculate the frequencies of seven lattice modes and fourteen internal mode components, and good agreement with spectroscopic data is obtained. Intermolecular {{force constant}}s decrease sharply with increasing separation and are well represented by exponential functions. <b>Intramolecular</b> <b>force</b> constants show only minor changes from their gas phase values...|$|E
40|$|Raman and i. r. spectra {{have been}} {{obtained}} of diketopiperazine and five of its isotopic derivatives: (CONDCH 2) 2, (CONHCD 2) 2, (CONDCD 2) 2, (13 CONHCH 2) 2 and (13 CONDCH 2) 2. In addition to solution spectra and powder spectra at room and liquid nitrogen temperatures, polarized Raman spectra were obtained on single crystals. These data have permitted an essentially complete assignment {{to be made of}} the Raman and i. r. modes of the crystal, a necessary step in the refinement of an <b>intramolecular</b> <b>force</b> field for this molecule [13]...|$|E
40|$|A gas-phase {{resonance}} Raman {{spectrum of}} chloroiodomethane has been obtained with excitation in the A-band absorption with similar resolution {{and the same}} experimental apparatus used to obtain solution-phase A-band resonance Raman spectra of chloroiodomethane reported previously. This allows a careful and detailed comparison of the gas-and solution-phase chloroiodomethane A-band resonance Raman spectra and their associated short-time photodissociation dynamics. The gas-phase A-band resonance Raman spectrum has four Franck-Condon active vibrational modes and a noticeable degree of multidimensionality in its photodissociation reaction. The A-band gas-phase resonance Raman intensities and absorption spectrum were simulated using a simple model and time-dependent wave-packet calculations. The motion of the wave packet on the excited state gas-phase potential surface was converted from dimensionless normal coordinates into easy-to-visualize internal coordinates using the results of normal coordinate calculations. The A-band early-time photodissociation dynamics {{are very similar to}} those of the solution phase in that the C-I bond lengthens, the I-C-Cl and H-C-I angles become smaller, and the H-C-Cl angles become larger. These short-time photodissociation dynamics are consistent with a simple impulsive 'semirigid' radical model description of the photodissociation. A comparison of the gas-phase and solution-phase short-time photodissociation dynamics suggests that solvation effects are not important for internal coordinate motions such as the C-I stretch and I-C-Cl angle where there are strong <b>intramolecular</b> <b>forces</b> but that solvation effects are noticeable for internal coordinate motions such as H-C-H angle and H-C-Cl angles which are weakly involved in the dissociation coordinate and have relatively weak <b>intramolecular</b> <b>forces</b> that are more easily perturbed by the solvent-solute forces. This implies that 'static' or mean-field solvation effects may be more significant for internal coordinate motions that have small <b>intramolecular</b> <b>forces</b> compared with internal coordinate motions that have much larger <b>intramolecular</b> <b>forces</b> from the photodissociation reaction. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of minerals and organic molecules crystallize easily, {{and the resulting}} crystals are generally of good quality, i.e. without visible defects. However, larger biochemical particles, like proteins, are often difficult to crystallize. The ease with which molecules will crystallize strongly depends on the intensity of either atomic forces (in the case of mineral substances), intermolecular forces (organic and biochemical substances) or <b>intramolecular</b> <b>forces</b> (biochemical substances).|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{some basic}} concepts for designer molecules with functional units which {{are driven by}} entropic rather than energetic forces. This idea profits from the mechanically interlocked nature of topological molecules such as catenanes and rotaxanes, which allows for mobile elements whose accessible configuration space gives rise to entropic <b>intramolecular</b> <b>forces.</b> Such entropy-driven designer molecules open the possibility for externally controllable functional molecules and nanomechanical devices.

40|$|Based on our Raman and i. r. [1] {{data and}} {{assignments}} for DKP {{and five of}} its isotopic derivatives, we have refined an <b>intramolecular</b> <b>force</b> field in a non-redundant basis. This analysis shows that the cis peptide group may be best differentiated from the trans {{by the presence of}} an NH out-of-plane bend mode in the 800 cm- 1 region. Several atom [...] atom potentials have been evaluated for their ability to explain observed lattice frequencies and internal mode splittings. Observed splittings in CO stretch modes can be accounted for by dynamical charge transfer and transition dipole coupling interactions...|$|E
40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} simulations {{are performed}} to study oxygen adsorption on platinum clusters supported on a graphite surface. The Sutton-Chen many-body potential {{is used for}} the Pt-Pt interaction, whereas a Steele potential was used to represent the carbon surface. The oxygen-oxygen <b>intramolecular</b> <b>force</b> is modeled by a harmonic oscillator model and other interactions are described by the Lennard-Jones potential. The results indicate an optimum loading of platinum for maximum specific adsorption of oxygen. Adsorption isotherms are constructed and the energies and orientation of adsorbed oxygen are reported. The relevance of this study to electrode processes is discussed. © 1998 Elsevier Science S. A. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{energy and}} its {{first and second}} {{geometrical}} derivatives obtained by DFT calculations {{for a number of}} conformations of a single molecule are used to parametrize <b>intramolecular</b> <b>force</b> fields, suitable for computer simulations. A systematic procedure is proposed to adequately treat either fully atomistic or more simplified force fields, as within the united atom approach or other coarse grained models. The proposed method is tested and validated by performing molecular dynamics simulations on several different molecules, comparing the results with literature force fields and relevant experimental data. Particular emphasis is given to the united atom approach for flexible molecules characterized by "soft" torsional potentials which are known to retain a high degree of chemical specificity...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{lipophilicity}} parameters (log P and log D) are well-known physico-chemical descriptors largely used in QSAR studies. Besides their numerical value, log P data {{contain a}} variety of information about inter- and <b>intramolecular</b> <b>forces</b> affecting partitioning and its related biological phenomena. The deconvolution of information from log P can be accessed only by adequate interpretative tools, such as new lipophilic-combined descriptors, of which features and some applications are presented in this review...|$|R
50|$|Intermolecular forces (IMFs) are {{the forces}} which mediate {{interaction}} between molecules, including forces of attraction or repulsion which act between molecules {{and other types}} of neighboring particles, e.g., atoms or ions. Inter-molecular forces are weak relative to <b>intramolecular</b> <b>forces</b> - the forces which hold a molecule together. For example, the covalent bond, involving sharing electron pairs between atoms, is much stronger than the forces present between neighboring molecules. Both sets of forces are essential parts of force fields frequently used in molecular mechanics.|$|R
50|$|Chaotropic salts that dissociate in {{solution}} exert chaotropic effects via different mechanisms. Whereas chaotropic compounds such as ethanol {{interfere with}} non-covalent <b>intramolecular</b> <b>forces</b> as outlined above, salts can have chaotropic properties by shielding charges and preventing the stabilization of salt bridges. Hydrogen bonding is stronger in non-polar media, so salts, which increase the chemical polarity of the solvent, can also destabilize hydrogen bonding. Mechanistically {{this is because}} there are insufficient water molecules to effectively solvate the ions. This can result in ion-dipole interactions between the salts and hydrogen bonding species which are more favorable than normal hydrogen bonds.|$|R
40|$|Direct use of {{experimental}} eigenvalues of the vibrational secular equation {{on to the}} ab initio predicted eigenvector space is suggested {{as a means of}} obtaining a reliable set of <b>intramolecular</b> <b>force</b> constants. This method which we have termed RECOVES (recovery in the eigenvector space) is computationally simple and free from arbitrariness. The RECOVES force constants, by definition, reproduce the experimental vibrational frequencies of the parent molecule exactly. The ab initio calculations were carried out for ethylene as a test molecule and the force constants obtained by the present procedure also correctly predict the vibrational frequencies of the deuterated species. The RECOVES force constants for ethylene are compared with those obtained by using the SQM procedure...|$|E
40|$|Elucidating the {{underlying}} mechanisms of cell physiology is currently an important research topic in life sciences. Atomic force microscopy methods {{can be used to}} investigate these molecular mechanisms. In this study, single-molecule force spectroscopy was used to explore the specific recognition between the CD 20 antigen and anti-CD 20 antibody Rituximab on B lymphoma cells under near-physiological conditions. The CD 20 -Rituximab specific binding force was measured through tip functionalization. Distribution of CD 20 on the B lymphoma cells was visualized three-dimensionally. In addition, the relationship between the <b>intramolecular</b> <b>force</b> and the molecular extension of the CD 20 -Rituximab complex was analyzed under an external force. These results facilitate further investigation of the mechanism of Rituximab's anti-cancer effect. © 2010 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to develop the {{calculation}} methods and to determine the inner force field parameters of methane and also to analyze the fine structure of Fourie-absorption spectrum CH_ 2 D_ 2. The method permitting to obtain the formulae of operator perturbation theory in the symmetrized form has been improved. The expressions for spectroscopic contants as functions of intramolecular parameters have been obtained. The evaluations of <b>intramolecular</b> <b>force</b> field parameters in methane have been performed.

40|$|Langseth and his {{co-workers}} [1] have recently applied the results of essentially incomplete spectroscopic studies of liquid cyclohexane, symmetrical tetrachloroethane, and ethylene deuterobromide {{to a discussion of}} the <b>intramolecular</b> <b>forces</b> restricting internal rotation about the C-C bond. We believe that none of their structural conclusions is correct. Their discussion is based on their conclusion that in these molecules the opposed or eclipse configurations are the stable ones. Insofar as liquid cyclohexane and symmetrical tetrachloroethane are concerned this conclusion is most probably incorrect since it directly contradicts the results of a great number of more straightforward studies of these and similar molecules...|$|R
40|$|The crystal {{structure}} of H 2 amben has been elucidated {{for the first}} time. The close NHN contact between neighbouring molecules supports strongly the notion that intermolecular hydrogen bonding exists within the crystal lattice, creating a series of molecular chains, which are crosslinked in a three-dimensional array. This intermolecular bonding is suggested {{to account for the}} anomalously high melting point of H 2 amben (176 - 178 ºC) compared to its H 2 salen counterpart (126 - 128 ºC). Although strong <b>intramolecular</b> <b>forces</b> are present in both ligands, H 2 salen contains no intermolecular hydrogen bonds...|$|R
40|$|We {{explore the}} role of {{crystallinity}} and inter- or <b>intramolecular</b> <b>forces</b> in chitosan for its solubility in water and demonstrate the expansion of its solubility to a wider pH range. Due to its semicrystalline nature, derived mainly from inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds, chitosan is water-soluble only at pH < 6. In acidic conditions, its amino groups can be partially protonated resulting in repulsion between positively charged macrochains, thereby allowing diffusion of water molecules and subsequent solvation of macromolecules. We show that chemical disruption of chitosan crystallinity by partial re-acetylation or physical disruption caused {{by the addition of}} urea and guanidine hydrochloride broadens the pH-solubility range for this biopolymer...|$|R
40|$|The head disk {{interface}} in a {{hard disk}} drive can {{be considered to be}} one of the hierarchical multiscale systems, which require the hybridization of multiscale modeling methods with coarse-graining procedure. However, the fundamental force field parameters are required to enable the coarse-graining procedure from atomistic/molecular scale to mesoscale models. In this paper, we investigate beyond molecular level and perform ab initio calculations to obtain the force field parameters. <b>Intramolecular</b> <b>force</b> field parameters for Zdol and Ztetraol were evaluated with truncated PFPE molecules to allow for feasible quantum calculations while still maintaining the characteristic chemical structure of the end groups. Using the harmonic approximation to the bond and angle potentials, the parameters were derived from the Hessian matrix, and the dihedral force constants are fit to the torsional energy profiles generated by a series of constrained molecular geometry optimization...|$|E
40|$|Structural and {{dynamical}} {{properties of}} the electrolyte system ethylene carbonate−Li + are studied. A high-level ab initio study of the geometry and vibrational spectrum has been performed both for an isolated molecule and for small clusters including the lithium ion. The ethylene molecule {{is found to be}} nonplanar in all instances, and an assignment of vibrational modes is proposed on this basis. It is shown that the lithium ion induces substantial blue- and redshifts, mainly on the ring- and carbonyl-stretching modes. These issues have also been studied in the liquid phase for the first time, and for that purpose, a new <b>intramolecular</b> <b>force</b> field has been developed. It is shown that this intramolecular potential satisfactorily reproduces a broad range of features, allowing us to interpret the shifts measured experimentally for the molecules within the first solvation shell of the ion. Particularly, the broadening of the carbonyl band found experimentally is the result of an ion-induced redshift, obscured by the presence of Fermi resonances. Moreover, the study of the shifts as a function of solvation number supports a 4 -coordinated solvation shell...|$|E
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} study of structural and dynamical properties of γ-butyrolactone (GBL) {{and the extent to}} which they are affected in the vicinity of a lithium ion, both in gas and liquid phases, is reported. The isolated GBL molecule is found to be nonplanar, with a barrier of ≈ 9 kJ/mol to ring inversion. As expected, the lithium ion coordinates the carbonyl oxygen with an almost collinear configuration relative to the carbon−oxygen bond but with a slight tilting toward the lactone oxygen. This configuration holds for clusters of up to four molecules and in the liquid phase as well (where a tetrahedral first solvation shell is found). A high level ab initio vibrational analysis, with a new assignment of bands has been performed, which shows substantial red and blue shifts upon lithium solvation, which decrease in a nontrivial way upon increasing the cluster size. To study the solvent effect of the vibrational spectrum, an accurate <b>intramolecular</b> <b>force</b> field has been developed, based on the concept of relaxed potential energy profiles. The inclusion of stretch and bend anharmonicity is shown to be essential in order to explain, not only the absolute value, but the sign of the shifts, particularly for the carbonyl stretching which is substantially downshifted. The shifts obtained for the rest of the bands, together with the diffusion coefficients for bulk GBL and for lithium, are in fair agreement with experimental results...|$|E
40|$|Semi-empirical {{conformational}} energy calculations {{were performed}} for the mononucleotides 5 '-AMP, NMN+ and 3 '-AMP. Only <b>intramolecular</b> <b>forces</b> are considered. Essentially all conformational states were explored {{to investigate the}} population distribution {{likely to be found}} in a non-crystalline environment. The calculations suggest that 5 '-AMP and 3 '-AMP are relatively flexible and a mixture of conformational states is expected. In contrast, the results for NMN+ suggest that a strong electrostatic interaction between the positively charged nicotinamide nitrogen atom and negatively charged phosphate oxygen is possible, stabilizing a few specific states. This interaction will be most significant in a solvent-free situation or an apolar environment...|$|R
2500|$|In dilute solution, the {{properties}} of the polymer are characterized by the interaction between the solvent and the polymer. In a good solvent, the polymer appears swollen and occupies a large volume. In this scenario, intermolecular forces between the solvent and monomer subunits dominate over intramolecular interactions. In a bad solvent or poor solvent, <b>intramolecular</b> <b>forces</b> dominate and the chain contracts. In the theta solvent, or the state of the polymer solution where the value of the second virial coefficient becomes 0, the intermolecular polymer-solvent repulsion balances exactly the intramolecular monomer-monomer attraction. Under the theta condition (also called the Flory condition), the polymer behaves like an ideal random coil. [...] The transition between the states is known as a coil-globule transition.|$|R
40|$|At {{the most}} {{fundamental}} level, inter- and <b>intramolecular</b> <b>forces</b> delineate the interface between a microorganism and a mineral surface. A new technique, termed biological force microscopy (BFM), is described {{that can be used}} to directly probe the dynamics of the mineral–microbe interface. BFM quanti � es attractive and repulsive forces in the nano-Newton range between living microbial cells and mineral surfaces in aqueous solution. Native bacterial cells are linked to a force-sensor that is used in a force microscope to measure bacteria–mineral interactions as a function of the distance between the mineral surface and the cells on the sensor. The magnitudes and ranges of the measured forces re � ect the chemical and structural intricacies of the mineral–microbe interface. BFM is presented with potential applications to studies assessing the role that microbes or biomolecules play in geochemical and mineralogical processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{vibrational}} energy distribution {{and the degree}} of dissociation within a system of hydrogen and oxygen molecules was modeled using molecular dynamics (MD). The first step in this process was to model the atomic and molecular interactions. Since hydrogen and oxygen form diatomic molecules, vibration is the only <b>intramolecular</b> <b>force</b> that must be computed. The Morse potential is used to perform this calculation. Atomic interactions outside the molecule are modeled using the Lennard-Jones potential. The {{vibrational energy}} level distribution of this model demonstrated excellent agreement with the Boltzmann distribution. In this molecular dynamics simulation, dissociation occurs when the potential energy between two vibrating atoms exceeds a critical value. Recombination is also possible between two previously dissociated atoms by the reverse mechanism. This process enables a system to start in a state of molecules and proceed to an equilibrated state of atoms and molecules. The molecular dynamics simulation accurately modeled both the rate of dissociation and the ratio of species at equilibrium. Finally, a system of both hydrogen and oxygen was simulated. The results of this simulation were compared to the CET code and showed excellent agreement. This investigation demonstrated that simple chemical reactions in relatively large systems can be modeled using molecular dynamics.

40|$|Intermolecular {{interactions}} {{are responsible for}} the deviations of gases from ideality, determine the three- dimensional structure and folding dynamics of biological molecules, and the binding of molecules to surfaces as in heterogeneous catalysis. The hydrogen bond is the most important intermolecular interaction. The most simple intermolecular interaction free from solvent and lattice effects arises when two chemical species are allowed to combine into a weakly bound gaseous molecular complex. In the present doctoral thesis the intermolecular interactions in a number of simple binary prototype molecular complexes held together by hydrogen bonds are investigated. The molecular complexes are studied by means of static gas-phase high-resolution absorption spectroscopy in the far- and near-infrared spectral regions. The high-brightness source of synchrotron radiation from the electron storage ring MAX-I at MAX-lab in Lund is used as a far-infrared radiation source. The far-infrared absorption spectra of the hydrogen-bonded molecular complexes OC-HCl, HCN-HCl and ammonia-HCN are recorded and provide information about the intermolecular hydrogen bond vibrations of the molecular complexes (Papers III-VI) introduced upon the complex formation. These floppy intermolecular hydrogen bond vibrations are directly correlated to the relative translation (stretching of the hydrogen bond) and the internal rotations of the subunits (bendings of the hydrogen bond). The spectral analyses allow the characterization of the intermolecular potential energy surface for these molecular complexes over a wide range of geometries away from the equilibrium structure. The near-infrared absorption spectra of the hydrogen-bonded molecular complexes HCN-HCN and HCN-HCl are recorded and provide information about the modification of the <b>intramolecular</b> <b>force</b> fields within the donor subunits by the incorporation into the bimolecular complex (Papers I and II) ...|$|E
40|$|High {{resolution}} THz (THz) spectroscopy in condensed phases is {{an emerging}} technique that can fingerprint molecules, {{such as the}} explosives found in IEDs, and active ingredients found in imported drug formulations. To date, large amounts of THz spectroscopic data are available for molecules in solid environments ranging from simple amino acid and peptide based systems to soft nanotubes. However, the theoretical methods to describe these systems and to predict spectroscopic features for new systems are not fully developed. Methods that take into account anharmonicity in vibrational motions and calculations based on anharmonic theory {{can be used to}} compare resulting spectra with experimental data. Such an analysis can then provide useful insight into the <b>intramolecular</b> <b>force</b> field of the molecular crystals in addition to predicting spectroscopic features. The methods have to go beyond the usually harmonic approximations under which vibrational spectroscopic data are analyzed. In our laboratory, we use the vibrational self-consistent field (VSCF) approach to model anharmonicity that has been successfully applied to systems in the gas-phase. The objective is to develop a generic algorithm for the calculations of vibrational spectroscopy of molecules in crystalline form. In summary, we have used molecular force fields to describe the potentials of the systems studied and we have calculated the spectral features at a harmonic level. We then used quantum force fields to study anharmonicity due to the potential. Finally, we have treated anharmonicity due to vibrational mode-coupling using the VSCF approach. In essence, the present study extends the VSCF method to periodic systems containing molecular repeating units, and applies appropriate boundary conditions for the systems studied. We have tested our methods on the following systems: trialanine in parallel, anti-parallel, and hydrated configurations, nanotubes made of alanine-isoleucine and simple amino acid based crystals. We find in general good agreement with the experimental data in terms of the spectral features...|$|E

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} a biomolecular measurement system (1), which enables {{to measure the}} intermolecular forces arising from the interaction between two biomolecules or the <b>intramolecular</b> <b>forces</b> within a single biomolecule by using an atomic force microscope (AFM). In the present invention, the cantilever (2) is moved only when the actuator (4) moves the magnetic nanowire (3) and thus moves the molecule attached {{to the end of}} the magnetic nanowire (3). Since the cantilever (2) is not moved, fluctuation and disturbance is not created in the liquid containing the biomolecules.
