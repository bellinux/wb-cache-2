40|$|Adductor brevis is an {{important}} member <b>of</b> the <b>adductor</b> family occupying the medial compartment of the thigh executing the function of adduction and medial rotation.

Materials and methods. The present study is based on diagnostic results of children with infantile cerebral palsy with affected upper limb. The main criterion for selection of patients was the presence of thumb adduction contracture, the absence of significant positive outcome in a patient after conservative treatment, the impossibility of active thumb abduction more than 30 ° and the instability of the first metacarpophalangeal joint. Total we examined and treated 9 patients with spastic types of cerebral palsy. Results and conclusions.

40|$|Objective: The hip {{dislocation}} {{especially in}} spastic form of cerebral palsy frequently occurs. It results in significant morbidity {{in terms of}} pain in the dislocated hip and destabilization of the pelvis. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the migration percentage in patients where only tenotomies <b>of</b> the <b>adductor</b> muscles were performed compared to patients where tenotomies <b>of</b> the <b>adductor</b> muscles were combined with neurectomy of the obturator nerve. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 50 patients (80 hips) divided in two groups. In 32 patients (47 hips) tenotomies <b>of</b> the <b>adductor</b> muscles were performed, in 18 patients (33 hips) tenotomies of the adductormuscles were combined with neurectomy of the obturator nerve in order to prevent and to decrease the incidence of hip dislocation. We used the Reimers’ hip migration percentage to evaluate the stability of the articulation. Results: In the group where tenotomies <b>of</b> the <b>adductor</b> muscles were combined with neurectomy of the obturator nerve, we cannot find a statistically significant difference when compared to the group where only tenotomies <b>of</b> the <b>adductor</b> muscles were performed. In the two year follow up period after the operations, a decrease of the migration percentage was noted in both groups of patients with gradual increase in the following period.

40|$|The {{biomechanics}} of trans-femoral amputations has {{not been}} previously described. Little {{attention has been paid}} to the importance <b>of</b> <b>adductor</b> magnus in holding the femur in its normal anatomical axis. Loss <b>of</b> function <b>of</b> <b>adductor</b> magnus leads to abduction of the residual femur, in a trans-femoral amputation. A cadaver study <b>of</b> the <b>adductor</b> group <b>of</b> thigh muscles has been done and the biomechanical importance of these muscles is documented. The moment arms <b>of</b> the three <b>adductor</b> muscles have been determined, based on muscle attachments and muscle size, relative to each other. Adductor magnus has a major mechanical advantage in holding the thigh in its normal anatomical position. Loss of the distal third of its attachment results in a 70 % loss of the effective moment arm of the muscle, which contributes to the abducted femur in standard trans-femoral amputations. A muscle preserving trans-femoral amputation, which keeps adductor magnus intact, prevents abduction of the residual femur and may allow for easier walking with a prosthesis. The conflicting reports about adductor magnus activity during the gait cycle can be explained by this muscle's dual innervation by the sciatic and obturator nerves and its dual function as a hip adductor and extensor...|$|R
40|$|Parrotfishes (family Labridae: Scarini) are {{regarded}} to have important roles {{for maintaining the}} ecosystem balance in coral reefs due to their removal of organic matter and calcic substrates by grazing. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to clarify the interspecific differences in grazing ability of five parrotfish species (Chlorurus sordidus, C. bowersi, Scarus rivulatus, S. niger and S. forsteni) in relation to interspecific differences in jaw-lever mechanics and the relative weight <b>of</b> the <b>adductor</b> mandibulae (muscles operating jaw closing). The grazing ability was calculated by using stomach contents (CaCO 3 weight/organic matter weight) defined as the grazing ability index (GAI). There were significant interspecific differences in GAI (C. sordidus = C. bowersi > S. rivulatus > S. niger = S. forsteni). Teeth of C. sordidus and C. bowersi were protrusive-shape whereas teeth of S. rivulatus, S. niger and S. forsteni were flat-shape. C. sordidus and C. bowersihave jaw-lever mechanics producing a greater biting force and have a larger weight <b>of</b> <b>adductor</b> mandibulae. S. rivulatus has jaw-lever mechanics producing a greater biting force but a smaller weight <b>of</b> <b>adductor</b> mandibulae that produce an intermediate biting force. In contrast, S. niger and S. forsteni have jaw-lever mechanics producing a lesser biting force and have a smaller weight <b>of</b> <b>adductor</b> mandibulae. Feeding rates and foray size of S. rivulatus, S. niger and S. forsteni were greater than C. sordidus and C. bowersi. The degree in bioerosion (GAI × feeding rate) was the largest for S. rivulatusand the smallest for S. forsteni. The degree in bioerosion for C. sordidus was larger than S. niger whereas relatively equal between C. bowersi and S. niger. These results suggest that interspecific difference in GAI was explained by interspecific differences in teeth shape, jaw-lever mechanics and relative weight <b>of</b> <b>adductor</b> mandibulae. The interspecific difference in the degree of bioerosion suggests the importance of various size of parrotfishes with diverse feeding modes to maintain healthy coral reef ecosystems...|$|R

The measurements were performed only once, in the first 72 hours of hospitalization. Data were analyzed using statistical software BioEstat 5. 0, with a significance level of 0. 05.

Hypothesis: An intervention program including muscle strengthening can reduce the incidence <b>of</b> <b>adductor</b> strains in profes-sional ice hockey players.

Methods: Thirty-three of 58 players from the same National Hockey League team were identified as “at risk ” on the basis <b>of</b> preseason hip <b>adductor</b> strength and participated in an intervention program. The program consisted of 6 weeks of exercises aimed at functional strengthening <b>of</b> the <b>adductor</b> muscles. Injury and individual exposure data were recorded for all players. Results: There were 3 adductor strains in the 2 seasons subsequent to the intervention, compared with 11 in the previous 2 seasons (0. 71 versus 3. 2 per 1000 player-game exposures).
