2500|$|By the 1990s, most Army units had {{replaced}} their older VRC-12 series FM radios {{for the new}} SINCGARS ("SINgle-Channel Ground-Air Radio Systems") family of equipment. Rather than sending a signal along one signal frequency, the SINCGARS radios sent its signals across many frequencies, [...] "hopping" [...] from one frequency to another at lightning speed. This allowed many channels of talk to share an already-crowded frequency spectrum. Later generations of these radios combined the communications security (COMSEC) <b>encryption</b> <b>devices</b> with the receiver/transmitter, making a single easier-to-program unit. Most significant, the SINCGARS radios could send and receive digital traffic with great fidelity. By the advent of Operation Desert Shield, all Army units were deployed using the most secure FM communications in the world. The SINCGARS radios have a failure rate in extreme heat of once every 7,000 hours compared to the VRC-12 series' failure rate of 2–300 hours.|$|E

50|$|Two {{major factors}} in the STU-III's success were the Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) {{and the use of}} a {{removable}} memory module in a plastic package {{in the shape of a}} house key, called a KSD-64A. The EKMS is believed to be one of the first widespread applications of asymmetric cryptography. It greatly reduced the complex logistics and bookkeeping associated with ensuring each <b>encryption</b> <b>device</b> has the right keys and that all keying material is protected and accounted for.|$|R
50|$|By itself, {{frequency}} hopping provides only limited protection against eavesdropping and jamming. Most modern military {{frequency hopping}} radios also employ separate <b>encryption</b> <b>devices</b> {{such as the}} KY-57 Speech Security Equipment. U.S. military radios that use frequency hopping include the JTIDS/MIDS family, the HAVE QUICK Aeronautical Mobile (OR) communications system, and the SINCGARS Combat Net Radio, Link-16.|$|E
50|$|Rainbow Technologies was an {{encryption}} {{and information}} security {{company based in}} Orange County, California, that was acquired by SafeNet, Inc. in 2003. Through its acquisition of Mykotronx, Rainbow Technologies was responsible for developing and supporting top secret <b>encryption</b> <b>devices</b> used by the NSA, NRO, and other government agencies. The company also had a line of commercial security and identity management products like the iKey USB authentication token.|$|E
50|$|Scramblers {{were used}} to secure voice traffic during World War II, but were often intercepted and decoded due to scrambling's {{inherent}} insecurity. The first true secure telephone was SIGSALY, a massive device that weighed over 50 tons.
