5|$|Clindamycin is a semisynthetic {{derivative}} of lincomycin, a natural antibiotic {{produced by the}} actinobacterium Streptomyces lincolnensis. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>obtained</b> by 7(S)-chloro-substitution of the 7(R)-hydroxyl group of lincomycin. The synthesis of clindamycin was first announced by BJ Magerlein, RD Birkenmeyer, and F Kagan on the fifth Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC) in 1966. It {{has been on the}} market since 1968.|$|E

There are two main varieties of myrrh: bisabol and herabol. Bisabol is produced by C. erythraea, an Arabian species similar to the C. myrrha, which produces the herabol myrrh. C. myrrha grows in Ethiopia, Arabia, and Somalia.|$|E

5|$|Oxyhalides and oxysulfides of {{protactinium}} are known. PaOBr3 has a monoclinic structure {{composed of}} double-chain units where protactinium has coordination 7 and is arranged into pentagonal bipyramids. The chains are interconnected through oxygen and bromine atoms, and each oxygen atom is related to three protactinium atoms. PaOS is a light-yellow non-volatile solid with a cubic crystal lattice isostructural {{to that of other}} actinide oxysulfides. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>obtained</b> by reacting protactinium(V) chloride with a mixture of hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide at 900°C.|$|E

25|$|The venom {{from this}} species {{is used in}} the {{manufacture}} of several drugs. One is called echistatin, which is an anticoagulant. Even though many other snake venoms contain similar toxins, echistatin is not only especially potent, but also simplistic in structure, which makes it easier to replicate. Indeed, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>obtained</b> not only through the purification of whole venom, but also as a product of chemical synthesis. Another drug made from E. carinatus venom is called ecarin and is the primary reagent in the ecarin clotting time (ECT) test, which is used to monitor anticoagulation during treatment with hirudin. Yet another drug produced from E. carinatus venom is Aggrastat (Tirofiban).|$|E
25|$|Students of {{integral}} calculus know that f(x) = x'p has an algebraic antiderivative {{except in the}} case p = –1 corresponding to the quadrature of the hyperbola. The other cases are given by Cavalieri's quadrature formula. Whereas quadrature of the parabola had been accomplished by Archimedes in the third century BC (in The Quadrature of the Parabola), the hyperbolic quadrature required the invention in 1647 of a new function: Gregoire de Saint-Vincent addressed the problem of computing the areas bounded by a hyperbola. His findings led to the natural logarithm function, once called the hyperbolic logarithm since <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>obtained</b> by integrating, or finding the area, under the hyperbola.|$|E
