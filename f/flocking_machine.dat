5000|$|Flocking {{is defined}} as the {{application}} of fine particles to adhesive coated surfaces. Nowadays, this is usually done by the application of a high-voltage electric field. In a <b>flocking</b> <b>machine</b> the [...] "flock" [...] is given a negative charge whilst the substrate is earthed. Flock material flies vertically onto the substrate attaching to previously applied glue. A number of different substrates can be flocked including textiles, fabric, woven fabric, paper, PVC, sponge, toys, and automotive plastic.|$|E
50|$|Nathan Edward (Ned) Rhyerson (aka Needlenose Ned) (Jed Rees) {{was born}} on February 2, 1972 in Glendale, CA. He is {{unmarried}} and has no criminal record. He leads Burbank police on a 20-mile high speed car chase before crashing his car into the Burbank Buy More {{as part of a}} complex Fulcrum plot to determine the whereabouts of Bryce and the Intersect, as well as to determine who Sarah and Casey were protecting at the Buy More. He pretends to be a frightened and confused amateur criminal, though he was later revealed to be much more capable than he initially let on. Rhyerson is neutralized when Morgan, Big Mike, and Captain Awesome use a pneumatic snow <b>flocking</b> <b>machine</b> to disorient and disarm him.|$|E
40|$|The fires which {{recently}} occurred in <b>flock</b> <b>machines</b> in America {{have shown that}} toady's knowledge of the ignitability of flock clouds on <b>flock</b> <b>machines</b> is not sufficient. This is why it has been investigated {{within the scope of}} a research project which minimum spark energy is required to ignite flock clouds on <b>flock</b> <b>machines.</b> The first step taken for this purpose consisted in measuring the minimum ignition energy of more than 60 commercial flock samples on a minimum ignition energy apparatus optimized for high spark energies. It turned out that the minimum ignition energy of flock depends on fiber diameter, fiber length, fiber material, type and quantity of the chemical preparation compound and on the fiber color. Average flock has a minimum ignition energy of about 150 mJ. The lowest value of approx. 80 mJ was obtained for the finest commercial ground cotton flock. If the fines content can accumulate, it is, however, possible that even much lower values can be reached. In a second step it was tried to ignite the most ignitable flock samples by sparks and arc discharges from <b>flock</b> <b>machines.</b> It turned out that the single sparks of DC <b>flock</b> <b>machines</b> which are not ignition-optimized ignited the most ignitable flock samples only at discharge energies above 1300 mJ. Such discharges can occur only during failures of large DC facilities. (orig.)
