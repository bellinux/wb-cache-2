Previous U. S. home price models lack data on credit constraints facing first-time home-buyers (and regional housing stocks), likely {{accounting for the}} poor performance of home price models based on interest rates and income (Gallin, 2006). We incorporate such omitted data into home price models which yield stable long-run relationships, more precisely estimated income and interest rate coefficients, reasonable speeds of adjustment, and improved model fits...|$|E
40|$|Most US house price models {{break down}} in the mid- 2000 's, due to the {{omission}} of exogenous changes in mortgage credit supply (associated with the sub-prime mortgage boom) from house price-to-rent ratio and inverted housing demand models. Previous models lack data on credit constraints facing first-time home-buyers. Incorporating a measure of credit conditions- the cyclically adjusted loan-to-value ratio for first time buyers – into house price to rent ratio models yields stable long-run relationships, more precisely estimated effects, reasonable speeds of adjustment and improved model fits. The recent boom and bust in U. S. housing markets has sparked interest in modeling the links between house prices and credit standards. As Meen (2001), Muellbauer and Murphy (1997) and Cameron, Muellbauer and Murphy (2006) stress, inverting the <b>effective</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>housing</b> services implies that house prices are a function of credit constraints as well as income, the housing stock and the real user cost of housing. Kim (2007) shows theoretically that down-payment or loan-to-value (LTV) constraints also help determine the house price-to-rent ratio. Models of U. S. house prices have been hindered {{by a lack of}} consistent time series measures of the exogenous changes in the credit constraints facing marginal, first-time home-buyers. This shortcoming suggests that most U. S. house pric...|$|E
40|$|Housing {{reform has}} been a key {{component}} in China's economic revitalization program initiated by the late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping since 1978. By reforming the welfare housing system, the Chinese government aims at the removal of a burden (i. e., welfare housing) from state finance. At the same time, housing reform will stimulate changes in consumption, investment, and related industrial sectors, and thus facilitate economic growth. This paper examines the impact of housing reform on consumption, investment, and industrial growth in three Chinese cities. Data are collected from field reconnaissance, government policy documents and census materials, covering the period 1985 - 1998. Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis are used for analyzing the data. Research findings revealed that housing reform resulted in drastic changes in housing investment and growth of related industries. Self-raised capital became {{the main source of}} housing investment, while state investment declined considerably. Significant correlations were clearly discernible between housing investment and related industries. Nevertheless, the power of resident's consumption, as measured by the percentage expenditure on real property, household articles and services, was a constraint against housing commercialization. Further reforms to raise the level of <b>effective</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>housing,</b> and to introduce various schemes in housing finance are critical for developing the housing industry into an engine of economic growth...|$|E
40|$|Real house {{prices are}} {{forecast}} to rise {{over the next}} two decades by about the same amount hey rose over the past two decades. The longer-run positive trends in real incomes and population size and the advance of the baby boom into ages of greater <b>effective</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>houses</b> are forecast to raise real house prices 10 %. Simulation indicates that the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>houses,</b> and thus the prices of houses, may fall when baby boomers reach adulthood, because the effects of the larger population may be more than offset by the effects of the lower individual real incomes of young workers. As boomers age, their changing preferences and rising incomes raise simulated house prices above their initial levels. Simulated house prices remain above their initial levels until the baby boom generation has died off. © 1991 Academic Press, Inc. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} project {{is to examine the}} market pricing behavior of vacation homes in resort property markets. To accomplish this a price index is constructed to track real price fluctuations from 1981 to 2010 for the 3 localized ski resort markets in Park City, Utah. The resulting price indices reveal a history of cyclical price movements, and surprising long-term real price depreciation of 12 % to 25 % between 1981 and 2010. To determine the causes of the cyclical movements in the price indices, time series analysis is performed, and a model created to predict market behaviors based on past levels of price, construction, and skier days. The results of this exercise reveal that the number of annual skier days in the area is an <b>effective</b> representative of <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>housing,</b> and that the local ski business has a considerable effect on real estate prices. Additionally, it is revealed that Park City's ski business is largely affected by national economic conditions, more so than by both regional economical conditions and local snowfall. The analysis concludes that despite the thirty year decline in real prices, the Park City resort market behaves as a well functioning, healthy market. The model indicates that while increases in prices do stimulate new construction, the growth in the total number of dwelling units reveals a relatively inelastic supply market. This suggests that any growth in demand should be accompanied with long-term price appreciation. Market forecasts based on various demand scenarios indicate that except in the most pessimistic cases, prices in Park City should experience healthy appreciation in the near to mid future. It is believed that these findings can be applicable to various resort markets. by Brady W. Larsen. Thesis (S.

40|$|HOUSING SUBSIDIES IN THE United States are {{provided}} by a patchwork of different programs and serve a variety of constituencies. The best-known programs are designed to serve low-income households directly by expanding the stock of “affordable ” housing through new construction or indirectly by increasing the <b>effective</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>housing.</b> The most expensive housing subsidy programs provide tax relief diffusely to homeowners of all income classes. The least well-understood programs provide government guarantees that {{reduce the cost of}} housing credit in the market. This paper considers these latter programs in the broader context of U. S. housing policy. In the first section we provide a brief review and taxonomy of federal housing programs, including direct public expenditures on housing and indirect expenditures through the tax system. We also describe federal credit and guarantee programs that reduce the cost of credit to those purchasing housing. In the second section, we summarize estimates of the economic and budgetary costs of these programs. We also compare these estimates across housing programs that serve households of various income classes. In the third section, we consider reforms to credit and guarantee programs that would improve efficiency and reduce costs to the U. S. Treasury. A final section offers a brief conclusion.

50|$|One example {{involves}} spillovers {{from the}} labor market to the goods market. If there is labour market disequilibrium such that individuals cannot supply all the labor they want to supply, then the amount {{that they are able}} to supply will influence their <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> goods; the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> goods, contingent on the constraint on the amount of labor that can be supplied, is their <b>effective</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> goods. In contrast, if there were no labor market disequilibrium, individuals would simultaneously choose both their quantity of labor to supply and the quantity of goods to purchase, and the latter would be their notional <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> goods. In this example, the <b>effective</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> goods would be less than the notional <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> goods.|$|R
