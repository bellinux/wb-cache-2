50|$|Mepitiostane, {{also known}} as <b>epitiostanol</b> 17β-(1-methoxy)cyclopentyl ether, is a {{synthetic}} androstane steroid and a derivative of DHT. It is the C17β (1-methoxy)cyclopentyl ether of <b>epitiostanol,</b> which itself is 2α,3α-epithio-DHT or 2α,3α-epithio-5α-androstan-17β-ol. A related AAS is methylepitiostanol (17α-methylepitiostanol), which is an orally active variant of <b>epitiostanol</b> similarly to mepitiostane, though also has a risk of hepatotoxicity.|$|E
50|$|Methylepitiostanol, {{also known}} as 2α,3α-epithio-17α-methyl-4,5α-dihydrotestosterone (2α,3α-epithio-17α-methyl-DHT) or as 2α,3α-epithio-17α-methyl-5α-androstan-17β-ol, is a {{synthetic}} androstane steroid and a 17α-alkylated derivative of DHT. It {{is closely related to}} <b>epitiostanol</b> (2α,3α-epithio-DHT) and mepitiostane (<b>epitiostanol</b> 17-methyloxycyclopentyl ether).|$|E
50|$|<b>Epitiostanol,</b> {{also known}} as 2α,3α-epithio-4,5α-dihydrotestosterone (2α,3α-epithio-DHT) or as 2α,3α-epithio-5α-androstan-17β-ol, is a {{synthetic}} androstane steroid and a derivative of DHT. Mepitiostane, a derivative of <b>epitiostanol</b> with a C17α methoxycyclopentane ether substitution, is an orally active prodrug of <b>epitiostanol.</b> Another derivative, methylepitiostanol (2α,3α-epithio-17α-methyl-5α-androstan-17β-ol), has a methyl group at the C17α position and is similarly an orally active variant of epitiostanol; it has surfaced as a novel designer steroid.|$|E
50|$|<b>Epitiostanol</b> binds {{directly}} to the androgen receptor (AR) and estrogen receptor (ER), where it acts as an agonist and antagonist, respectively. It is described as potent in its activity as an antiestrogen and comparatively weak as an AAS. In any case, in terms of AAS potency, <b>epitiostanol</b> {{has been found to}} have 11 times the anabolic activity and approximately equal androgenic activity relative to that of the reference AAS methyltestosterone. The mechanism of action of <b>epitiostanol</b> in breast cancer is multimodal; it directly suppresses tumor growth through activation of the AR and inhibition of the ER, and, in premenopausal women, it additionally acts as an antigonadotropin and reducing systemic estrogen levels via AR activation and consequent suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. <b>Epitiostanol</b> is unique among AAS in acting as an antagonist of the ER.|$|E
50|$|Methylepitiostanol (online product names Epistane, Hemapolin, Havoc, Epi Plex) is an orally active anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) of the {{dihydrotestosterone}} (DHT) {{group which}} was first {{described in the}} literature in 1974 but was never marketed. It is the 17α-methylated derivative of <b>epitiostanol,</b> an AAS and antiestrogen which was formerly used {{in the treatment of}} breast cancer in Japan. Similarly to mepitiostane, methylepitiostanol is an orally active variant of <b>epitiostanol.</b> Due to its C17α methyl group, the drug is considered to have a high potential for hepatotoxicity.|$|E
50|$|Mepitiostane is {{described}} as similar to tamoxifen as an antiestrogen, and through its active form <b>epitiostanol,</b> binds directly to and antagonizes the ER. It is also an AAS.|$|E
50|$|Similarly to {{the case}} of testosterone, <b>epitiostanol</b> shows poor {{bioavailability}} and weak therapeutic efficacy when taken orally due to extensive first-pass metabolism. As such, it must instead be administered via intramuscular injection.|$|E
50|$|A prodrug of <b>epitiostanol,</b> mepitiostane, {{which is}} also marketed for the {{treatment}} of breast cancer, is reported to show a high rate of virilizing side effects such as acne, hirsutism, and voice changes in women.|$|E
50|$|<b>Epitiostanol</b> (brand name Thiodrol) is an {{injected}} steroidal antiestrogen and anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) of the dihydrotestosterone (DHT) {{group which}} {{was described in}} the literature in 1965 and has been marketed in Japan as an antineoplastic agent {{for the treatment of}} breast cancer since 1977.|$|E
50|$|Mepitiostane (brand name Thioderon) is an orally active steroidal {{antiestrogen}} and anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) of the dihydrotestosterone (DHT) {{group which}} is marketed in Japan as an antineoplastic {{agent for the}} treatment of breast cancer. It is a prodrug of <b>epitiostanol.</b> The drug was patented and described in 1968.|$|E
