25|$|Similar to the {{opportunities}} in 1944 of international and nationwide gathering of Bahá'ís, the first Bahá'í World Congress {{was attended by}} Bahá'ís from South Carolina where again {{the scope of the}} community was more plain and invigorating to those that attended. “Seeing all these people from different ethnic and religious backgrounds, the beauty of these diverse people coming together for one purpose, I <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> happen all over the world. It wasn’t just in Greenville, South Carolina; this was a world community.…I already knew that, but at the World Congress I saw it.” This event saw the election of the Universal House of Justice, the new head of the religion since the death of Shoghi Effendi, for the first time.|$|E

Last but not least we must thank the gig securety and the Belo Horizonte police for escorting us though the angry mob. [...] We do not hate the angry mob who came to hurt us. In fact, our message in our shows is to love your enemy. So God bless everybody who stood outside chanting: Fuck Antestor! Hope we can talk like reasonable people someday over a fresh squeezed juice. Extra special hails to our fans who had the balls to come although they <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be dangerous. Antestor salutes you and be blessed." [...] In a newspaper interview with the Norwegian Christian newspaper Dagen two days following the band's safe return to Norway, bassist Erik Normann Aanonsen said that he had prepared himself for the worst-case scenario that the tour could end in death, and he reiterates the band's gratitude to the aggressive Brazilian Satanists stating: [...] "We're now twice as big in Brazil as we were before we went there." ...|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} groups {{set off the}} weather deteriorated, as had been forecast, but the first party {{successfully}} navigated to the Curran shelter where they dug snow from the door and spent the night. The leader of the second party, worried {{that they would not}} be able to find the shelter in white-out conditions – she <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> become completely covered in snow – decided on a forced bivouac out on the plateau. The site she chose was at a slight dip at the head of the Feith Buidhe burn about [...] east of Lochan Buidhe and the Curran shelter. Beattie was not worried about the missing people because he assumed they had gone to some other shelter.|$|E
2500|$|Recording cover {{versions}} of songs {{was a common}} practice during the 1940s and 1950s, and [...] "Blue Suede Shoes" [...] {{was one of the}} first songs RCA Victor wanted its newly contracted artist, Elvis Presley, to record.

RCA Victor, with its superior distribution and radio contacts, <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> probably steal a hit record from Phillips and Perkins. Presley, who knew both Perkins and Phillips from his days at Sun Records, gave in to pressure from RCA, but he requested that the company hold back his version from release as a single.

2500|$|The German missionaries Johannes Rebmann of Mombasa and Krapf {{were the}} first Europeans {{to try to reach}} the snowy mountain. According to English {{geographer}} Halford Mackinder and English explorer Harry Johnston, Rebmann in 1848 was the first European to report the existence of Kilimanjaro. Hans Meyer has claimed that Rebmann first arrived in Africa in 1846 and has quoted Rebmann's diary entry of 11 May 1848 as saying, [...] "This morning, at 10 o'clock, we obtained a clearer view of the mountains of Jagga, the summit of one of which was covered by what looked like a beautiful white cloud. When I inquired as to the dazzling whiteness, the guide merely called it 'cold' and at once I <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be neither more nor less than snow.... Immediately I understood how to interpret the marvelous tales Dr. Krapf and I had heard at the coast, of a vast mountain of gold and silver in the far interior, the approach to which was guarded by evil spirits." [...] In light of these sources, J. Shearson Hyland's assertion that Rebmann first saw the mountain in 1840 appears to be erroneous.|$|E

2500|$|After Cumia {{made several}} more {{appearances}} on Hughes's show, the two entered discussions {{to become a}} full-time radio team. Hughes had wished to evolve his show to [...] "more than just me on the radio", and <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be achieved with Cumia's on-air personality. Cumia accepted, and Hughes pitched the idea to WBAB management {{with the intent of}} moving to the morning or afternoon slot, but it was declined. During this time Ron Valeri, the program director at rock station WAAF in Boston, Massachusetts, went to Long Island to visit family and heard the two on the air. He called Hughes and offered them a spot on WAAF. Hughes then assembled an aircheck from tapes of their first shows together, and sent them to WAAF and another station in Dallas, Texas. Both stations wished to hire the duo, which led to their departure at WBAB. WAAF general manager Bruce Mittman recalled that he [...] "almost drove off the road laughing" [...] from listening to them, and subsequently hired them to take over afternoons from Liz Wilde. Before they left WBAB, the station offered Cumia to take over Hughes's night shift, which the two later saw as [...] "a scumbag move" [...] as their bits were being played on the morning show without their permission. Hughes was cautious about moving as he felt unsure if the show's success would translate to a new radio market. Cumia ended his manual labor job, and threw his tools out of his car window while driving in hope of never returning to it.|$|E
