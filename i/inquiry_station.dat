50|$|The {{original}} 305 RAMAC {{computer system}} could be housed in a room of about 9 m (30 ft) by 15 m (50 ft); the 350 disk storage unit measured around 1.5 m2. The first hard disk unit was shipped September 13, 1956. The additional components of the computer were a card punch, a central processing unit, a power supply unit, an operator's console/card reader unit, and a printer. There was also a manual <b>inquiry</b> <b>station</b> that allowed direct access to stored records. IBM touted the system as being able to store the equivalent of 64,000 punched cards.|$|E

In addition to its original functions, such as metro line <b>inquiry,</b> <b>station</b> information, street scenes at exits, and public service information, the app adds many practical functions, such as photo-realistic navigation and interactions. There are approximately one million users; to date, 35  % of these are 30 -day active users.|$|E

It was possible that Sam would not take my departure for granted so readily as I assumed. It was Sam's way to do a thing thoroughly, and the probability was that, if he did not actually come to see me off, he would at least make <b>inquiries</b> at the <b>station</b> to find out if I had gone.

25|$|Several {{articles}} in the radio magazine Popular Communications published in the 1980s and early 1990s described hobbyists using portable radio direction-finding equipment to locate numbers stations in Florida and in the Warrenton, Virginia area of the United States. From the outside, they observed the station's antenna inside a military facility, the Warrenton Training Center. The station hunter speculated that the antenna's transmitter at the facility was connected by a telephone wire pair to a source of spoken numbers in the Washington, D.C. area. The author said the Federal Communications Commission {{would not comment on}} public <b>inquiries</b> about numbers <b>stations</b> on American territory.|$|R
40|$|The {{extensive}} {{introduction of}} cottonseed meal into this state {{during the period}} of high priced grain prevailing {{in the early part of}} the past year led to many <b>inquiries</b> at this <b>station</b> as to how much of the product could be safely and judiciously fed to domestic animals. We are now feeding cottonseed meal to fattening cattle, in supplementing a corn ration, a t the rate of 31 / 2 pounds per head daily with entirely safe and satisfactory results. We have also in like manner fed as high as seven pounds per head daily without injury, though the economy of feeding as heavily as this is doubtful. The result of feeding cottonseed meal to hogs has been published in bulletin No. 28 and this experiment was conducted to determine the effect of cottonseed meal upon the flavor, and other qualities, of butter when fed to dairy cows...|$|R

The network quickly dismissed any move of Leno to any time slot other than 10p.m., stating that WHDH's plan was a [...] "flagrant" [...] violation of the station's contract with the network and that it would consider moving the NBC affiliation to another Boston area station, either by creating an owned-and-operated station through an [...] "existing broadcast license" [...] in the market owned by NBC or by seeking <b>inquiries</b> from other <b>stations</b> in the market to acquire the affiliation.

40|$|Adopting proper {{agricultural}} management and conserving {{soil organic matter}} are important components of sustainable agriculture. Soil organic matter content is a key attribute in soil quality. Labile organic matter pools {{can be considered as}} suitable indicators of soil quality that are very sensitive to changes in soil management practices. This research was carried out to investigate some organic carbon labile pools as an indicator evaluating the effects of different managements on some quality parameters of two calcareous soils. The study was conducted in 2 locations: 1 - plots that receiving 0 (C 1), 25 (C 2), 50 (C 3) and 100 (C 4) Mg/ha of manure for five years successively with a cropping rotation of wheat –corn every year and plots under three cropping rotations (C 5, C 6 and C 7) at Lavark experimental farm and 2 - <b>inquiry</b> research <b>station</b> of Fozveh at different plots with three different cropping rotations (C 8, C 9 and C 10) with a given cropping history recorded for the last 5 years. Soil samples were taken from the center of each plot and the depths of 0 - 5 cm and 5 - 15 cm. Their organic carbon, hot water soluble carbohydrate, particulate organic matter (POM), organic carbon and hot water soluble carbohydrate of POM, mean weight diameter of water stable aggregates were determined. Different managements consisting of different levels of manure and types of cropping rotation had significant effects on the soil characteristics measured. The greateast amount of carbohydrate and aggregate stability was obtained in the plots of 100 Mg/ha of manure in Lavak and in alfalfa plots in Fozveh station. Also, the results showed that aggregate stability has a better correlation with hot water soluble carbohydrate in comparison with other soil organic pools. Therefore, the carbohydrate extracted by hot water may be used as an index to assess the impacts of different {{agricultural management}} systems on soil quality...|$|R
