50|$|A <b>fish</b> <b>flake</b> is a {{platform}} built on poles and spread with boughs for drying cod on the foreshore of fishing villages and small coastal towns in Newfoundland and Nordic countries. Spelling variations for <b>fish</b> <b>flake</b> in Newfoundland include flek, fleyke, fleake, flaik and fleack Its first recorded use {{in connection with}} fishing appeared in Richard Whitbourne's book Newfoundland (1623, p. 57). In Norway, a flake {{is known as a}} hjell.|$|E
50|$|This fish is a {{relatively}} new addition to the fish keeping hobby. The Denison's barb is a schooling fish that is usually kept in groups. It tends to be peaceful but some have been known to be slightly aggressive around food, especially if kept in less space than they require. They eat bloodworms, shrimp, meat, <b>fish</b> <b>flake</b> and some vegetation. A similar fish, Sahyadria chalakkudiensis is sometimes confused with this fish, but it is a larger, less colourful and a more aggressive species.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Fish</b> <b>Flake</b> Hill Historic District {{encompasses}} {{a section of}} Front Street in Beverly, Massachusetts that includes a remarkable concentration of colonial buildings, and which was notable for its importance in the American Revolutionary War. The district, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971, includes properties {{on both sides of}} Front Street between Cabot and Bartlett Streets. It includes houses dating to the middle 18th century, sixteen of which have been documented as being associated with ship captains active in the American Revolutionary War. The port area of Beverly {{was one of the most}} active during the war, and was one of the places where many captured ships were brought.|$|E
50|$|The <b>fish</b> <b>flake</b> was a {{permanent}} structure {{that was part}} of the landscape of a fishing village. These were not located too far away from the fishing stages that were built on the shoreline. The flake was built high off the ground and required stable construction with a sloping ramp to gain access to it. The ramp was required such that fishermen carried a full load of fish on barrows was able to negotiate its accent. At one end of the flake was built a building that served dual purposes. The construction of the building, called fish store, was of two story construction and had to be large enough to accommodate a season's voyage of fish on the top level. In the lower section of the fish store was kept the gear that was used for fishing, buoy's, ropes, killicks, grapples and other miscellany items.|$|E

40|$|This study {{describes}} experimental herbivory and detritivory {{of three}} common native aquatic macrophyte species by the introduced Mozambique tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus (Peters) (Pisces: Cichlidae), and its physiological {{response to their}} consumption. There was a highly significant effect of fish herbivory on plant weight {{for each of the}} macrophyte species, but this effect was not influenced by any preference for periphyton. Despite the herbivory, there was a highly significant loss of fish body weight across all plant species and weight could only be maintained by supplementary feeding of a high protein <b>fish</b> <b>flake.</b> These results suggest that despite eating these plants, an alternative food resource may be needed for survival and may trigger trophic plasticity in O. mossambicus...|$|E
40|$|What are the {{mechanisms}} that prevent partners from cheating in potentially cooperative interactions between unrelated individuals? The cleaner fish Labroides dimidiatus and client reef fish both {{benefit from an}} interaction {{as long as the}} cleaner eats ectoparasites. However, the cleaner fish prefers some client mucus, which constitutes cheating. Field observations suggested that clients control such cheating by using punishment (chasing the cleaner) or by switching partners (fleeing from the cleaner). Here, we tested experimentally whether such client behaviours result in cooperative cleaner fish. Cleaners were allowed to feed from Plexiglas plates containing prawn items and <b>fish</b> <b>flake</b> items. A lever attached to the plates allowed us to mimic the behaviours of clients. As cleaners showed a strong preference for prawn over flakes, we taught them that eating their preferred food would cause the plate to either chase them or to flee, while feeding on flakes had no negative consequences. We found a significant shift in cleaner fish foraging behaviour towards flake feeding after six learning trials. As punishment and terminating an interaction resulted in the cleaners feeding against their preferences in our experiment, we propose that the same behaviours in clients improve the service quality of cleaners under natural conditions...|$|E
40|$|A short-term, sublethal, and {{cost-effective}} in situ sediment toxicity assay for routine assessments with the midge Chironomus riparius Meigen, based on postexposure feeding, {{was developed and}} evaluated. An inexpensive and easy-to-use assay chamber was designed. A sediment toxicity assay was successfully performed at a lentic system impacted by acid mine drainage, at sites with different types of sediment. It consisted of a 48 -h exposure period followed by a 1 -h postexposure feeding during which the larvae were fed on Artemia franciscana nauplii. Methodologies for feeding quantification of fourth-instar larvae (10 -d old) were first developed and optimized under laboratory conditions. A. franciscana nauplii were shown to be more suited than <b>fish</b> <b>flake</b> food for postexposure feeding quantification, allowing higher precision {{and cost-effective}}ness. It also required a shorter postexposure feeding period, thus minimizing the chances for an eventual organism physiological recovery from toxicant exposure. The influence of several environmental conditions during exposure on postexposure feeding was also evaluated: temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, salinity, hardness, substrate, humic acids, light, and food availability. Only temperature was found to significantly influence postexposure feeding rates; exposure at 5 °C led to reduced feeding activity compared to 30 °C. Recovery rates of 87 % were obtained after the 48 -h field exposure at all sites (except site R 2). A statistically significant postexposure feeding depression was observed at the three sites impacted by acid mine drainage. Therefore, the proposed short-term in situ assay is a potentially useful tool to assess sediment sublethal toxicity on a routine basis. [URL]...|$|E

50|$|Lower Island Cove {{was once}} a {{thriving}} economic centre. Located on the northern entrance to Conception Bay, it once boasted three cod liver factories.

50|$|Some good {{foods to}} try in the {{aquarium}} are california blackworms, daphnia, microworms, {{and having a}} healthy population of snails. Some pygmy sunfish will learn to supplement their diet with crushed flake food, but {{this should not be}} relied upon as the only food source. The crushed <b>fish</b> <b>flakes</b> are a good idea, though, because they will feed the microfauna that will in turn feed the Elassoma.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Standard {{ecotoxicological}} {{tests are}} {{as simple as}} possible and food sources are mainly chosen for practical reasons. Since some organisms change their food prefer-ences during the life-cycle, they might be food limited at some stage if we do not account for such a switch. As organisms tend to respond more sensitively to toxicant exposure under food limitation, the interpretation of test results may then be biased. Using a reformulation of the von Bertalanffy model to analyze growth data of the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis, we detected food limitation in the early juvenile phase. The snails were held under conditions proposed for a standardized test protocol, which prescribes lettuce as food source. Additional experiments showed that juveniles grow considerably faster when fed with <b>fish</b> <b>flakes.</b> The model is based on Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory, which allows for mechanistic interpretation of toxic effects in terms of changes in energy allocation. In a simulation study with the DEB model, we compared the effects of three hypothetical toxicants in different feeding situations. The initial food limitation when fed with lettuce always intensified the effect of the toxicants. When fed with <b>fish</b> <b>flakes,</b> the predicted effect of the toxicants was less pronounced. From this study, we conclude that (i) the proposed test conditions for L. stagnalis are not optimal, and require further investigation, (ii) <b>fish</b> <b>flakes</b> are a better food source for juvenile pond snails than lettuce, (iii) analyzing data with a mechanistic modeling approach such as DEB allows identifying deviations from constant con-ditions, (iv) being unaware of food limitation in the labo-ratory can lead to an overestimation of toxicity in ecotoxicological tests...|$|R
50|$|During the American Revolution, {{fishermen}} {{and their families}} abandoned the Isles of Shoals off the coast and floated their homes to the Lower Town waterfront, where they were rebuilt. They hauled their boats at Lobster Cove and dried their catch on <b>fish</b> <b>flakes,</b> after which the tongue would be named Stage Neck. In 1807, President Thomas Jefferson's embargo crippled local mercantile trade, and by the Civil War, Stage Neck had deteriorated into a ramshackle slum.|$|R

50|$|Identified in April 2007 from {{specimens}} {{shipped to}} the United Kingdom in a consignment of aquarium fishes, the dracula fish has so far only {{been found in the}} wild in a small stream at Sha Du Zup between Mogaung and Tanai in northern Myanmar. It is a colourless miniature species and grows to a maximum size of around 17 mm. The fish has an elongate body with a large head and eyes. Dracula fish lack scales and the upper body is dominated by the jaws on large males. Much of the fish's structure is cartilaginous: it has 44 fewer bones than the zebrafish, and thus it is translucent and appears similar to larval forms.
