25|$|The {{output of}} a magneto {{depends on the}} speed of the engine, and {{therefore}} starting can be problematic. Some magnetos include an impulse system, which spins the magnet quickly at the proper moment, making easier starting at slow cranking speeds. Some engines, such as aircraft but also the Ford Model T, used a system which relied on non rechargeable dry cells, (similar to a large <b>flashlight</b> <b>battery,</b> and which was not maintained by a charging system as on modern automobiles) to start the engine or for starting and running at low speed. The operator would manually switch the ignition over to magneto operation for high speed operation.|$|E

50|$|Electrical firemaking {{involves}} the contact of an electrically heated object to tinder. A current is {{run through the}} object until it is red hot, like the burners on an electric stove, and it is brought {{into contact with the}} tinder, lighting it. For example, a foil-paper chewing gum wrapper will heat-up and ignite; or a <b>flashlight</b> <b>battery</b> coming into contact with a thin wire mesh (such as steel wool) may produce enough heat to ignite charcloth or other tinder. Larger batteries can generate sparks when its leads touch.|$|E

40|$|Photovoltaics (PV) is {{a growing}} {{business}} worldwide, with new technologies evolving towards potentially large-volume production. PV use produces no emissions, thus offsetting many potential environmental problems. However, the new PV technologies also bring unfamiliar environment, safety, and health (ES and H) challenges that require innovative solutions. This is {{a summary of the}} issues, solutions, and perspectives {{associated with the use of}} cadmium in one of the new and important PV technologies: thin-film, cadmium telluride (CdTe) PV, which is being developed and commercialized by several companies including Solar Cells Inc. (Toledo, Ohio), BP Solar (Fairfield, California), and Matsushita (Japan). The principal ES and H issue for thin-film cadmium telluride PV is the potential introduction of cadmium [...] a toxic heavy metal [...] into the air or water. The amount of cadmium in thin-film PV, however, is quite small [...] one nickel cadmium <b>flashlight</b> <b>battery</b> has about as much cadmium (7 g) as a square meter of PV module using current technology [...] and a typical cordless power tool will have 5 [...] 10 batteries. CdTe modules are also very well sealed, limiting the chance of release. Nonetheless, minimizing the amount of cadmium in cadmium telluride modules and preventing the introduction of that cadmium into the environment is a top priority for National Renewable Energy Laboratory researchers and cadmium telluride PV manufacturers...|$|E
40|$|Energy is much in {{the news}} lately. The term 2 ̆ 2 energy 2 ̆ 2 usually refers to the {{inherent}} ability of a material system, such as a person, a <b>flashlight</b> <b>battery,</b> or rocket fuel, to bring about changes in its environment or in itself. Some common sources of energy are the fuel used to heat hot water, the gasoline that propels a car, the dammed water that drives the turbine in a hydroelectric plant, and the spinning yo-yo that can climb up its own string. Inanimate energy sources are of central importance in raising {{the standard of living}} of mankind above the subsistence level. The physicist distinguishes among several types of energy, including kinetic energy (associated with a flying arrow or other moving object), elastic energy (associated with stretched or compressed strings), chemical energy (associated with fuel-oxygen systems or a storage battery), thermal energy (associated with the sun and other objects that are hotter than their surroundings), and nuclear energy. Applications of the energy concept in the science of mechanics, which you are studying now, usually concentrate on kinetic energy, potential energy (to be introduced in the module Conservation of Energy) and work (the transfer of energy by the action of a force. Sometimes the phrase 2 ̆ 2 mechanical energy 2 ̆ 2 is used to refer to the forms of energy of importance in mechanics. When you get on your bicycle, you have undoubtedly noticed that it takes a good deal of effort to get yourself moving rapidly. If you exert yourself very strenuously, you can reach a given speed after a short distance; or you can take it easy and pedal over a longer distance to reach the same speed. In some sense it always takes the same amount of 2 ̆ 2 work 2 ̆ 2 to reach a given speed [...] either a large exertion for a short distance or a small exertion for a long distance. You may also have noticed that if you are carrying a passenger on your bike, then it takes more 2 ̆ 2 work 2 ̆ 2 to reach the same speed. It turns out that these intuitive relationships among the 2 ̆ 2 work 2 ̆ 2 done on a system, its mass, and changes in its speed can be sharpened into a precise statement, called the work-energy theorem. (One caution, though: the technical definition of work needed for this precise statement is different from its everyday usage and physiologic meanings; e. g., you do no work on a heavy box by merely holding it still.) As you will begin to see in the present module, this relationship between work and mechanical energy gives you a new and powerful tool for the solution of many problems, a tool that is often easier to use than a direct application of Newton 2 ̆ 7 s second law...|$|E
