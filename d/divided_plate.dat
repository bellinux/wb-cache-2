The plate spin motion generates a shear motion at the plate boundary and is associated with toroidal motion, whereas straight plate motion results in poloidal motion at both subduction zones and ridges, and toroidal motion along transform faults. Therefore, the ratio of spin motion to straight motion {{can be used as}} an index of the toroidal/poloidal ratio.|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{and experimental}} {{study has been}} conducted on two-dimensional laminar natural convection heat transfer in an undivided and divided vertical isothermal channel. For the divided channel configuration, an isothermal plate at the same temperature as the channel walls was located on the channel centre line. The study examined the effect of Rayleigh number, plate-to-channel length ratio, vertical plate position, and plate thickness on the heat transfer from the channel walls, the <b>dividing</b> <b>plate</b> and the channel as a whole.;Solutions to both the full elliptic and parabolic forms of the Navier-Stokes and energy equations have been obtained for Prandtl number Pr = 0. 7 (air). Closed form expressions were derived for the limiting case of fully developed flow in the divided channel. Experimental measurements were made in air with a Mach-Zehnder interferometer.;Positioning the plate {{at the bottom of}} the channel gave the highest average Nusselt numbers for the <b>dividing</b> <b>plate</b> and the overall channel. At low Rayleigh number, when the plate is {{at the bottom of the}} channel, extending the channel walls above the plate increased the plate heat transfer by as much as a factor of four. At higher Rayleigh number, plate average Nusselt numbers as much as two times the isolated plate Nusselt number were predicted numerically.;In the fully developed regime, a short <b>dividing</b> <b>plate</b> located at the channel inlet reduces the wall average Nusselt number by about a factor of two, compared with the undivided channel. At moderate and high Rayleigh number, the wall average Nusselt number was almost independent of both the vertical plate position and the plate-to-channel length ratio.;At low Rayleigh number, increasing the <b>dividing</b> <b>plate</b> thickness caused the plate and wall average Nusselt numbers to decrease significantly. At high Rayleigh number the effect of plate thickness was small.;Average Nusselt number correlations are presented for the <b>dividing</b> <b>plate,</b> the channel wall and the overall channel...|$|R

HCLL-TBM is planned to be located in an ITER equatorial port, housed inside an AISI 316 stainless steel-supporting frame. Since that frame has been designed to provide two positions separated by a <b>dividing</b> <b>plate</b> and the HCLL-TBM is expected to fill one of them, its nuclear response could vary depending on the filling status of the other position and on the plate thickness. A parametric study has been carried out to investigate the potential effects on the radiation-induced damage of the HCLL-TBM structural material, due to the <b>dividing</b> <b>plate</b> thickness and to the presence of either a void, a water-cooled steel plug, or a Helium-Cooled Pebble Bed TBM in the adjacent frame position...|$|R
5000|$|Interchangeable {{indexing}} {{plates are}} used {{when the work}} must be rotated to an angle not available on the direct indexing plate. Because the hand crank is fixed to the spindle at a known ratio (commonly 40:1) the <b>dividing</b> <b>plates</b> mounted at the handwheel {{can be used to}} create finer divisions for precise orientation at arbitrary angles. These <b>dividing</b> <b>plates</b> are provided in sets of several plates. Each plate has rings of holes with different divisions. For example, an indexing plate might have three rows of holes with 24, 30, and 36 holes in each row. A pin on the hand crank engages these holes. Index plates with up to 400 holes are available. [...] Only one such plate can be mounted to the dividing head at a time. The plate is selected by the machinist based on exactly what angle he wishes to index to.|$|R

It enables the operator to drill or cut work at exact intervals around a fixed (usually horizontal or vertical) axis. Some rotary tables allow the use of index plates for indexing operations, and some can also be fitted with <b>dividing</b> <b>plates</b> that enable regular work positioning at divisions for which indexing plates are not available. A rotary fixture used in this fashion is more appropriately called a dividing head (indexing head).|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to experimentally determine the performance characteristics of certain probe geometries and their respective locations in the sink tube of a pneumatic angular rate sensor. Sensor response was determined for various flow rates and angular velocities for each test condition. It was found that the pickoff element placed inside the sink tube yields a longer linear-response range than the one placed outside the sink tube. Use of one of the special flow <b>dividing</b> <b>plates,</b> with the probe located outside the sink tube, improves the linearresponse range of the sensor for all flow rates, but increases the magnitude of the response only for the lower flow rates. It was also observed that neither the shortening of the sink tube length downstream of the pickoff location nor the presence of a shallow circumferential groove at the midsection of the pickoff element alters the performance of the probe.

6000|$|... § 2. The mineral called mica, {{described}} {{in the course of}} the last chapter, is closely connected with another, differing from it in containing a considerable quantity of magnesia. This associated mineral, called chlorite, is of a dull greenish color, and opaque, while the mica is, in thin plates, more or less translucent; and the chlorite is apt to occur more in the form of a green earth, or green dust, than of finely <b>divided</b> <b>plates.</b> The original quantity of magnesia in the rock determines how far the mica shall give place to chlorite; and in the intermediate conditions of rock we find a black and nearly opaque mica, containing a good deal of magnesia, together with a chlorite, which at first seems mixed with small plates of true mica, or is itself formed of minute plates or spangles, and then, as the quantity of magnesia increases, assumes its proper form of a dark green earth.|$|R

50|$|Understanding {{the concept}} of {{capacitance}} {{can be helpful in}} understanding why nanotechnology is such a powerful tool for the design of higher energy storing capacitors. A capacitor’s capacitance (C) or amount of energy stored is equal to the amount of charge (Q) stored on each <b>plate</b> <b>divided</b> by the voltage (V) between the plates. Another representation of capacitance is that capacitance (C) is approximately equal to the permittivity (ε) of the dielectric times the area (A) of the <b>plates</b> <b>divided</b> by the distance (d) between them. Therefore, capacitance is proportional to the surface area of the conducting plate and inversely proportional to the distance between the plates.|$|R

5000|$|The {{steering}} rack is almost conventional. As {{with a normal}} power-assisted steering setup, there is a rack-and-pinion, and a stepped hydraulic ram with a <b>dividing</b> <b>plate</b> (the piston) in the middle. On {{one side of the}} plate, the piston area is half the area of the other, giving twice the area for the fluid to work on. Thus, with full system pressure on the small area side of the ram, and half system pressure on the large area side, the ram remains perfectly balanced and centred. This is because the lower pressure is working on a larger surface area. The smaller side of the piston is at constant hydraulic pressure, the other side only varies in pressure. NOTE: The author seems to be describing the DS power steering piston and rod, on which the piston {{is in the middle of}} the rod. The SM's steering cylinder has the piston on the end of the rod, which rod's cross-sectional area is half the area of the other side of the piston. Full hydraulic pressure is admitted to the rod side at all times while the pressure on the other side of the piston (its [...] "head") is regulated.|$|R

40|$|Landing gears {{have been}} {{identified}} as major noise source contributors during the aircraft’s approach to landing phase. Techniques such as using fairings to alter the flow around the landing gear components have shown to reduce noise. This study investigates methods to further improve the fairing performance. A fundamental study has been performed to understand the influence of using a fairing on a simple cylindrical strut when a split plate is placed in the cavity between the fairing and the strut. Aerodynamic and acoustic tests are performed. Wind tunnel tests equipped with a phased microphone array as well as far field measurements have been conducted out on the fairing-cylindrical strut configuration. The results show that the splitter plate either reduces or eliminates the vortex shedding which in turn reduces noise. This is due to the <b>dividing</b> <b>plate</b> blocking the interaction between the two opposing shear layers aft of the fairing’s trailing edge and reducing their interaction with the downstream strut. Lower velocities around the shell and the strut are observed {{with the use of the}} splitter plate as well as reduction of recirculating flow within the shell strut cavity. This alteration in the flow characteristics results in a broadband noise reduction and hence reducing the self-noise generated by the fairing...|$|R

6000|$|... 501. A glass vessel had a platina plate fixed perpendicularly across it, so as {{to divide}} it into two cells: a head of mica was fixed over it, {{so as to}} collect the gas it might evolve during experiments; then each cell, and the space beneath the mica, was filled with dilute sulphuric acid. Two poles were provided, {{consisting}} each of a platina wire terminated by a plate of the same metal; each was fixed into a tube passing through its upper end by an air-tight joint, {{that it might be}} moveable, and yet that the gas evolved at it might be collected. The tubes were filled with the acid, and one immersed in each cell. Each platina pole was equal in surface {{to one side of the}} <b>dividing</b> <b>plate</b> in the middle glass vessel, and the whole might be considered as an arrangement between the poles of the battery of a humid decomposable conductor divided in the middle by the interposed platina diaphragm. It was easy, when required, to draw one of the poles further up the tube, and then the platina diaphragm was no longer in the middle of the humid conductor. But whether it were thus arranged at the middle, or towards one side, it always evolved a quantity of oxygen and hydrogen equal to that evolved by both the extreme plates[A].|$|R
