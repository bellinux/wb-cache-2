40|$|This {{qualitative}} research study explored {{the experiences of}} students who had attended a co-operative (co-op) education program, {{with a focus on}} what makes the experience meaningful to them. Utilizing a basic interpretive research design, students who graduated from a co-op program were interviewed using an open-ended interview protocol. Both male and female students were selected based on graduation date and came {{from a wide range of}} program types. Findings for this study were examined through the lens of connected-learning, a learning method that places emphasis on discussion, collaboration, and acceptance for knowledge development. Several themes emerged including experience, relationships, time, fees, and luck. Findings suggest that co-operative education is beneficial, but it is made meaningful by more than securing paid work terms. My interest in co-operative education stems from my job where <b>I</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> university level co-operative (co-op) education program.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} Phase <b>I</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> go/no go decision on Phase II funding. In the first objective, we assessed {{the extent to which}} fluid-mineral equilibria controlled deep water compositions in geothermal systems across the Great Basin. Six systems were evaluated: Beowawe; Desert Peak; Dixie Valley; Mammoth; Raft River; Roosevelt. These represent a geographic spread of geothermal resources, in different geological settings and {{with a wide range of}} fluid compositions. The results were used for calibration/reformulation of chemical geothermometers that reflect the reservoir temperatures in producing reservoirs. In the second objective, we developed a reactive -transport model of the Desert Peak hydrothermal system to evaluate the processes that affect reservoir fluid geochemistry and its effect on solute geothermometry. This included testing geothermometry on “reacted” thermal water originating from different lithologies and from near-surface locations where the temperature is known from the simulation. The integrated multi-component geothermometer (GeoT, relying on computed mineral saturation indices) was tested against the model results and also on the systems studied in the first objective...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a general}} {{dichotomy}} in popular culture {{on the future of}} robotics and artificial intelligence: the Humans-Against-the-Machines scenario versus the We-Become-Them scenario. The likely scenario is the latter, which is compatible with an optimistic posthuman world. However, the technological and cultural paths to robotic integration still have many problems and pitfalls. This essay focuses on Human Robot Interaction issues that apply to adoption of robots in many aspects of life as well as adoption of robotics into humans themselves. The main message of the essay is that the evolution of intelligent species is dependent on interfaces. Several months ago, on a Sunday afternoon, I set out on a perilous adventure in Harvard Square – mission objective: haircut. The journey ended at the only place open, a hair salon of no distinction. As is typical of the haircutting persuasion, the hairdresser assaulted me with chit chat.
