5|$|Wills {{states that}} Rutherford seemed to relish his {{descriptions}} of how completely the wicked {{would be destroyed}} at Armageddon, dwelling at great length on prophecies of destruction. <b>He</b> <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> towards the close of his ministry Rutherford spent about half of each year's Watchtowers writing about Armageddon.|$|E
5|$|At a VA {{hospital}} in Fort Evanston, Maryland, Lieutenant Colonel Victor Stans makes his third suicide attempt; <b>he</b> <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> a mysterious figure {{will not let}} him die. Stans attempts to drown in a tub of scalding water, but is rescued by the hospital staff and subsequently is disfigured due to the hot water.

50|$|Michael Lane {{was arrested}} {{the same day}} at his then {{workplace}} in Burgess Hill. He initially lied to police about his movements that day, before admitting that {{he had gone to}} Shana Grices' home. <b>He</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had found the front door open, then found Shanas' body in her bedroom. <b>He</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> panicked, then left the scene without dialling 999, checking Shanas' vital signs or telling his family what he had found. <b>He</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> only kept quiet about what he had seen because he was afraid of being accused of her murder.|$|R
50|$|Pruner {{studied the}} racial {{structure}} of Negros in Egypt. In a book {{which he wrote}} in 1846 <b>he</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> Negro blood had a negative influence on the Egyptian moral character. He published a monograph on Negros in 1861. <b>He</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> the main feature of the Negros skeleton is prognathism, which <b>he</b> <b>claimed</b> was Negros relation to the ape. <b>He</b> also <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> Negros had very similar brains to apes and that Negros have a shortened big toe which is a character which connects the Negros close to apes.|$|R
5|$|Invader works incognito, often masked {{and largely}} at night. To guard his {{anonymity}} on camera during interviews, he pixellates {{his own image}} or wears a mask as a disguise. <b>He</b> <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> {{only a few people}} know his real name and his face, and that his parents think he works as a tiler in the construction industry.|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus, only 43,000 Persians {{survived the}} battle. The number who died, of course, {{depends on how}} many there were in the first place; there would be 257,000 dead by Herodotus' reckoning. Herodotus claims that the Greeks as a whole lost only 159 men. Furthermore, <b>he</b> <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> only Spartans, Tegeans and Athenians died, since {{they were the only}} ones who fought. Plutarch, who had access to other sources, gives 1,360 Greek {{casualties}}, while both Ephorus and Diodorus Siculus tally the Greek casualties to over 10,000.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{admits that}} there may be death metal {{influences}} in the vocals, but says {{that it was not a}} conscious design, and that the music does not have any other similarities to death metal. <b>He</b> <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> there are no black metal influences. He says that describing Celestiial's music as folk is a bad idea, as folk is such a broad, vague description as to make it meaningless. He says that what he is creating is neither folk, nor traditional, and even the harp songs are not traditional works, though they are influenced by the traditional music of the United Kingdom and traditional Irish music.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> his {{comic books}} work outshone his other {{literary}} production.|$|R
50|$|According to Pourpirar a few {{historic}} {{sites that are}} said to be Parthian are either clearly related to Greeks or are modern forgery. <b>He</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> all inscriptions said to be Sassanid are modern forgeries. <b>He</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> historical personalities such as Mazdak, Mani, Zoroaster, Babak, Abu Moslem, and Salman the Persian were invented by modern Jewish historians.|$|R

5|$|Catelyn {{arrives in}} King's Landing, {{supposedly}} in secret. However, she is {{taken by a}} pair of city watchmen to a brothel owned by Littlefinger. He meets her to tell her that he had her brought there to keep her safe and hidden. Varys, also present, reveals that he learned of Catelyn's arrival through his spies. The three of them and Ser Rodrik discuss the attempted murder of Bran. Littlefinger shocks them all by admitting that the assassin's dagger was once his own. <b>He</b> <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> he lost it to Tyrion Lannister, betting on Jaime Lannister to win a previous tourney. Littlefinger arranges a meeting between Eddard and Catelyn, and Eddard reluctantly takes on Littlefinger as an ally who will help them find Bran's assailant.|$|E
5|$|Hemming singles out the conquests of England by Cnut and William the Conqueror {{as being}} {{especially}} damaging. <b>He</b> <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> the work only covers the lost estates that {{were assigned to}} support the cathedral chapter, but as he describes the loss of several manors that were listed in Domesday Book as belonging to the bishop, the work probably covers more than the author claims. It also contains a listing of amounts paid to King William to regain items the king had taken from the diocese. Worcester paid over 45.5 marks of gold to recover their belongings. Others singled out in the work as significant plunderers of Worcester's lands included Leofric, Earl of Mercia, {{and other members of}} his family.|$|E
5|$|In The Acharnians, Aristophanes blames Aspasia for the Peloponnesian War. <b>He</b> <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> the Megarian decree of Pericles, which {{excluded}} Megara {{from trade}} with Athens or its allies, was retaliation for prostitutes being kidnapped {{from the house}} of Aspasia by Megarians. Aristophanes' portrayal of Aspasia as responsible, from personal motives, for {{the outbreak of the}} war with Sparta may reflect memory of the earlier episode involving Miletus and Samos. Plutarch reports also the taunting comments of other comic poets, such as Eupolis and Cratinus. According to Podlecki, Douris appears to have propounded the view that Aspasia instigated both the Samian and Peloponnesian Wars.|$|E
50|$|Franz Ignaz Pruner (1808-1882) was {{a medical}} doctor who studied the racial {{structure}} of Negroes in Egypt.

5|$|Rick and Lori {{decide to}} do the {{operation}} without the necessary equipment. As they prepare for the operation, Shane arrives with the medical supplies, but without Otis. <b>He</b> <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> Otis sacrificed himself {{in order to save}} Carl. The episode flashes back to show Shane sacrificed Otis by shooting him in the leg and leaving him as bait for the walkers while he escaped with the medicine. The episode ends in the present, with Shane shaving his head, wiping out evidence of a bald spot of torn hair caused by Otis during their brief scuffle.|$|E
5|$|Stacy Carter met Jerry Lawler, {{her future}} husband, at a charity {{softball}} game at Treadwell High School in Memphis on July 23, 1989, {{two months before}} her nineteenth birthday. She was attending the game with her mother, who was dating {{one of the players}} on the team for which Lawler also played. Lawler, however, was married at the time, and <b>he</b> <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> when he initially met Carter, he considered an affair. After Lawler separated from his wife, Carter moved in with him. When Carter first met Lawler, she was working as a bank teller. Lawler later helped her get a job at a photography studio, and she also opened and ran her own hair salon.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Mr. Gold asks Emma {{to track}} down Ashley. <b>He</b> <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> she has {{something}} that belongs to him and that Ashley is unstable and troubled. Emma reluctantly agrees, and learns from Ruby (Meghan Ory) that she should stop by the home of her ex-boyfriend Sean (Phillipps). Emma goes there and speaks to Sean and his father, finding {{out that it is}} the latter that has told him not to get involved with the pregnant teenager. Emma discovers that Ruby has given her car to Ashley so that she can leave Storybrooke and head to Boston. Emma and Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) find the vehicle has crashed just short of the city's limits, with Ashley about to deliver the baby.|$|E

5|$|However, Bo's {{campaign}} {{was criticized for}} running roughshod over judicial due process and eroding the rule of law. Individuals targeted in the campaign were arbitrarily detained by the authorities, with an estimated 1,000 being sent to forced labor. Lawyers for the accused were intimidated and harassed, and {{in at least one}} case, sentenced to 18 months in prison. Allegations also surfaced over the use of torture to extract confessions. Moreover, assets seized during the campaign were allegedly redirected to help pay for Bo's popular social housing programs. The Wall Street Journal reported that $11 billion went into government coffers through the campaign. Li Jun, a fugitive businessman, asserted that he became a target of Bo anti-corruption drive {{as a result of a}} land dispute with the government. When he refused government demands to give up the land, <b>he</b> <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> he was abducted and tortured, and that $700 million worth of assets in his business were seized.|$|E
5|$|The agents {{return to}} Mulder's motel room, finding it ransacked by Max. He {{turns out to}} be a fan of Mulder's, having {{followed}} NICAP's research into his work on the X-Files. Max brings the agents to his Airstream trailer, where he shows them audio transmissions from the deputy, as well as a fire crew that arrived at the crash site. Mulder and Scully visit the deputy's widow, who claims the government won't release her husband's body and has threatened her into silence. They also meet a doctor who treated the deputy and the fire crew, revealing that they died of abnormally severe burns; <b>he</b> <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> he was also threatened. Henderson arrives at the hospital with a group of burned soldiers, who were attacked after they cornered the invisible alien at their base.|$|E
5|$|Theories vary among {{archaeologists and}} historians {{regarding}} {{who built the}} Polonnaruwa Vatadage, and when. One such theory suggests that it was built by Parakramabahu I during his reign in the 12th century. The Culavamsa, an ancient chronicle, mentions that he built a circular stone shrine to hold the tooth relic of the Buddha. Archaeologist Harry Charles Purvis Bell believed that this shrine is the Polonnaruwa Vatadage. This is contradicted by several ancient sources of the island, including Rajavaliya and Poojavaliya, which mention that it was built by Nissanka Malla. However, according to the studies of Arthur Maurice Hocart, Nissanka Malla only renovated an already existing building and made some additions such as the entrance and outer porch. Wilhelm Geiger, who translated the ancient Mahavamsa, and historian H. W. Codrington both agree with this theory. A nearby stone inscription set by Nissanka Malla lists the Vatadage among his constructions. In this, <b>he</b> <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> it was built {{by one of his}} generals under his own direction.|$|E

5|$|Espejo {{attacked}} Barreto's {{report in}} three ways. First, <b>he</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> Barreto, supposed {{author of the}} report, was not capable of writing it. Then {{he argued that the}} allegations were exaggerated semi-truths or outright lies. And finally <b>he</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> the economic problems of Quito could not be solved by exploiting its human resources (the Indians) but by planning and taking advantage of the natural resources of the region.|$|R
5|$|With {{the spiders}} distracted, Finn and Jake {{try to escape}} from the web, but to no avail. Ed later returns with a flaming sword, which he {{presents}} to Barb. However, she gets angry, arguing that he picked the gift because he liked, not because she would like it. Angered, Ed cuts the web, releasing Finn and Jake; <b>he</b> <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> Barb is dependent on him for food, as she cannot spin her own webs due to some unknown dysfunction. Barb attacks Ed, noting that she will have to eat him instead. Finn tries to help, but is pinned to a wall by Barb, who suddenly beings to moan as if in pain. Just then, an enormous egg sack emerges from her epigyne. The sack bursts, giving birth to thousands of tiny spiders, who proceed to bury Finn and Jake.|$|E
5|$|Imitating the Greek {{example of}} martial {{exercises}} and issuing of standard equipment for citizen soldiery, Philip II transformed the Macedonian army from a levied force of unprofessional farmers into a well-trained fighting force. Philip II's infantry wielded peltai shields that already disembarked from the hoplon style shield featured in sculpted artwork of a Katerini tomb dated {{perhaps to the}} reign of Amyntas III of Macedon. His early infantry were also equipped with protective helmets and greaves, as well as sarissa pikes, yet according to Sekunda they were eventually equipped with heavier armor such as cuirasses, since the Third Philippic of Demosthenes in 341 BC described them as hoplites instead of lighter peltasts. As evidenced by the Alexander Sarcophagus, troops serving Alexander the Great were also armored in the hoplite fashion. However, Errington argues that breastplates were not worn by the phalanx pikemen of either Philip II or Philip V's reign periods (during which sufficient evidence exists). Instead, <b>he</b> <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> breastplates were only worn by military officers, while pikemen wore the kotthybos stomach bands along with their helmets and greaves, wielding a dagger as a secondary weapon along with their shields.|$|E
5|$|Villani {{states that}} by noon on Thursday, November 4, 1333, a flood along the Arno River {{spread across the}} entire plain of San Salvi. He wrote that by nightfall the eastern wall {{of the city that}} was damming the water became damaged and then washed away in the flood, {{allowing}} the flood waters to breach and fill the city streets. <b>He</b> <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> the water rose above the altar in the Florence Baptistry, reaching over half the height of the porphyry columns. Bartlett notes that these columns, presented to Florence by the Pisans more than two hundred years before, have scratched lines to this day indicating the water level reached by the flood in 1333. Villani further claims that the height of the flood water in the courtyard of the commune's palace (residence of the podestà) reached 3m (10ft). The Carraia bridge collapsed with the exception of two of its arches, while the Trinità bridge collapsed except for one pier and one arch located towards the church of the Santa Trinità. The Ponte Vecchio—save the two central piers—was swept away when huge logs in the rushing water became clogged around the it, allowing the water to build and leap over the arches, states Villani. There was an old statue of Mars that stood on a pedestal near the Ponte Vecchio, but this too was taken by the flood along the Arno.|$|E
25|$|On {{the second}} day, Reginald Gough gave evidence. <b>He</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{and his wife}} were kind to the boys and fed them very well.
