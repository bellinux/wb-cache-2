500|$|In {{many places}} the film {{references}} classic movies, predominantly those by Disney. When Tinker Bell falls on Donkey {{and he says}} [...] "I can fly" [...] and people around including the Three Little Pigs say [...] "He can fly, he can fly"; this is a reference to Disney's Peter Pan. This scene is also {{a reference to the}} Disney film Dumbo, where Donkey says, while flying, [...] "You might have seen a house fly, maybe even a super fly, but <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>you</b> ain't never seen a Donkey fly" [...] The scene where Fiona is singing to the blue bird is a reference to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The transformation scene {{at the end of the}} film strongly references to Disney's Beauty and the Beast.|$|E
500|$|Fujisawa and Honda visited Kreidler and Lambretta showrooms, {{as well as}} others, {{researching the}} kind of {{motorcycle}} Fujisawa had in mind. [...] Fujisawa said these designs had [...] "no future" [...] and would not sell well. His concept was a two wheeler for everyman, one that would appeal to both developed and developing countries, urban and rural. The new motorcycle needed to be technologically simple to survive in places without up-to-date know-how and access to advanced tools or reliable spare parts supplies. The common consumer complaints of noise, poor reliability, especially in the electrics, and general difficulty of use {{would have to be}} addressed. Because Honda was a large company growing larger, it needed a mass-appeal product that could be produced on an enormous scale. The design had to be sorted out before production began, because it would be too costly to fix problems in the vast numbers that were to be manufactured. The scooter type nearly fitted the bill, but was too complex for developing countries to maintain, and the small wheels did poorly on badly maintained or nonexistent roads. Another of Fujisawa's requirements was that it could be ridden with one hand while carrying a tray of soba noodles, saying to Honda, [...] "If you can design a small motorcycle, say 50cc with a cover to hide the engine and hoses and wires inside, I can sell it. I don't know how many soba noodle shops there are in Japan, but <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>you</b> that every shop will want one for deliveries." ...|$|E

Examples include eating a full jar of mayonnaise ($235USD), eating a [...] "worm burrito" [...] ($265USD), and taking shots of corn oil, Pepto-Bismol, lemon juice, hot sauce, cold chicken broth, and cod liver oil (US$450.00 for all nine shots). The webcast was a success, with over a million hits {{in the first five}} days. MTV later bought and aired the show, which Spurlock hosted. [...] The list of documentary films that inspired Spurlock includes Brother's Keeper, Hoop Dreams, The Thin Blue Line, Roger and Me, Harlan County USA, and The Last Waltz.

Brown also believes that the smiley face images found in some of the cases are likely nothing more than coincidences based upon making a guess at where the body entered the water and searching a wide area until an example of smiley face graffiti can be found.

2500|$|In 1908, the Harden–Eulenburg affair {{badly damaged}} Wilhelm's {{reputation}} when Wilhelm's and Chamberlain's mutual friend Eulenburg was exposed {{in the press}} as a homosexual. Since Eulenburg had been the Emperor's best friend since 1886, the scandal led to much gossip all over the Reich about whether Wilhelm and Eulenburg {{had been more than}} just best friends. Since Eulenburg was quite open about being gay {{when he was in the}} company of his closest friends, and he and Wilhelm had been the very best of friends for 22 years, leading the British historian John C. G. Röhl to conclude it was very unlikely that Wilhelm was ignorant of Eulenburg's sexual orientation as he claimed after Eulenburg was outed. After Eulenburg was exposed, the Kaiser wrote him a very cold letter saying that he could not stand the company of homosexuals, as such their friendship was now over and he never wanted to see or hear from Eulenburg again. Chamberlain was nowhere never as close to Eulenburg as Wilhelm was, and seemed genuinely shocked to learn of the allegations that Eulenburg was gay. The Eulenburg affair played a role in Germany very similar to the Dreyfus affair in France except the victim in this case was the prominent anti-Semite Eulenburg. During the scandal, practically the entire völkisch movement came out in support of Eulenburg whom they portrayed as an Aryan heterosexual framed by false allegations of homosexuality by the Jews' Max Bernstein and Magnus Hirschfeld. The German journalist Theodor Wolff wrote in 1906 about Eulenburg's role as one of Germany's chief anti-Semites: <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>you</b> ten to one that it was that skald , the friend and admirer of Gobineau, who first pointed his other friend, the Kaiser towards the racial prophet's most eager disciple, Houston Stewart Chamberlain. The mystical notion of the [...] "race that will bring order to the world" [...] found its way from Gobineau via Eulenburg and Chamberlain to the Kaiser, and this notion in turn gave rise to the thought that [...] "the world should be healed by the German spirt." [...] In a letter to Chamberlain, Wilhelm wrote that entire scandal had emerged because of [...] "Jewish cheek, slander and lies". In the same letter, an enraged Wilhelm told Chamberlain that Maximilian Harden, the German Jewish convert to Lutheranism and the journalist who had outed Eulenburg was a [...] "loathsome, dirty Jewish fiend" [...] and a [...] "poisonous toad out of the slime of hell, a disgraceful stain on our Volk". However, despite his strongly held anti-Semitism and his frequently expressed wish to expel the entire German Jewish community, the Kaiser held back under the grounds that if he expelled all of the Jews from Germany, it would set the German economy back by a century, and as such, he had to grudgingly tolerate his Jewish subjects.|$|E
