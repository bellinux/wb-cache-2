25|$|In 1999, a North Carolina {{grand jury}} handed down indictments against pig-farm workers on Belcross Farm in Camden County, the first indictments for animal cruelty on a <b>factory</b> <b>farm</b> in the United States, after a three-month PETA {{investigation}} produced {{film of the}} workers beating the animals. In 2004, PETA published {{the results of an}} eight-month undercover investigation in a West Virginia Pilgrim's Pride slaughterhouse that supplies chickens to KFC. The New York Times reported the investigation as showing workers stomping on live chickens, throwing dozens against a wall, tearing the head off a chicken to write graffiti, strangling one with a latex glove, and squeezing birds until they exploded. Yum Brands, owner of KFC, called the video appalling and threatened to stop purchasing from Pilgrim's Pride if no changes were made. Pilgrim's Pride subsequently fired 11 employees and introduced an anti-cruelty pledge for workers to sign.|$|E

First, I will argue that it is morally wrong to cause unnecessary harms to sentient beings. Then, I demonstrate ways in which the <b>factory</b> <b>farming</b> industry causes unnecessary harms to sentient beings. Finally, I will arise at the conclusion that humans have moral obligations to refrain from consuming <b>factory</b> <b>farmed</b> goods...|$|R

2500|$|America’s largest crop is corn (maize). Corn is a readily available, reliable, store {{able and}} {{versatile}} commodity. In the average American supermarket, corn derived ingredients {{can be found}} in one-fourth of everything on the shelves. This includes not only food items, but also cosmetics, toiletries, cleaning products and household goods. Aside from that, corn is also used for the feeding of <b>factory</b> <b>farm</b> animals, for the production of alcohol, and {{can be used as a}} fuel source for both heat production and vehicles. On top of being a versatile commodity, corn has been genetically modified in a way that facilitates industrial-agricultural harvesting and large yields. Between the years 1920 and 1980, US corn yields increased 333 percent and continue to improve. The strains of corn used for industrial farming are engineered to grow in a uniform, perfectly upright fashion that facilitates mechanical harvesting. Corn is also modified to thrive in crowded conditions; [...] of land can accommodate around 30,000 plants and produce roughly 180 bushels of corn, with each bushel weighing in at 56 pounds. Genetic modifications have made it possible for certain strains of corn to be naturally insect resistant. Cheap and readily available chemical pesticides and synthetic fertilizers have contributed greatly to high crop yields; corn has also been engineered to tolerate chemicals and to efficiently utilize petrochemical fertilizers. Increases in the productivity of corn have helped to keep food prices low. America’s number one crop has an undeniably important place in both the economy and in peoples' diets. Versatility, affordability and the promise of large yields makes corn the perfect capitalist commodity crop. While commodity corn farming has important benefits, it can also have negative effects socially, economically and environmentally.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (LLM (Environmental Law and Governance)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{determine}} the impact of <b>factory</b> <b>farming</b> on the environment in South Africa. It also determined whether the current existing environmental legislation in the country adequately regulates the growing industry. The various impacts that <b>factory</b> <b>farms</b> may have on the environment are discussed in detail and they include water pollution, air pollution and desertification. The applicable laws are discussed in detail and also applied to the environmental impacts caused by the activities on <b>factory</b> <b>farms</b> to determine the strengths and shortcomings in South African environmental legislation, regarding regulation of the industry. The application of common law, such as the law of nuisance is also discussed and considered as a possible remedy. This study concludes that there is a lack of environmental law and regulations, which specifically regulate and resolve the environmental problems relating to the activities on <b>factory</b> <b>farms.</b> Without sufficient and effective legislation to regulate the industry, the activities on <b>factory</b> <b>farms</b> may lead to severe environmental degradation.

50|$|Local {{foods are}} {{sometimes}} {{considered the most}} climate friendly because the energy needed to store and transport the meat {{is removed from the}} equation. There is a decrease in greenhouse gases emitted because locally grown goods {{do not need to be}} transported across the country, or constantly cooled in large refrigerators. Another benefit of locally grown food is its lower concentration of pollution sources. According to the USDA, more than 335 million tons of manure are produced annually in American <b>farms.</b> In <b>factory</b> <b>farms,</b> this waste is extremely concentrated, and without proper regulation and disposal, the waste pollutes the surrounding areas. The Natural Resource Defense Council even remarks that <b>factory</b> <b>farms</b> have reached a point in which the farms threaten public health. Pollutants from the manure and urine of overcrowded <b>factory</b> <b>farms</b> lead to water and air pollution. Some of these pollutants, such as hydrogen sulfide and various nitrates, are dangerous even at low levels. <b>Factory</b> <b>farms</b> are also considered unsanitary because they place animals in overcrowded conditions in fully enclosed rooms that often become the perfect breeding grounds for diseases. Locally grown foods support free-range or pasture-grazing farming methods, decreasing the need for large <b>factory</b> <b>farms.</b> With fewer <b>factory</b> <b>farms,</b> waste will not be so concentrated and will thus not have such profound effects on the immediate surrounding areas.|$|R
