25|$|In 2012, {{the flow}} cytometry {{community}} {{has started to}} release a set of publicly available <b>datasets.</b> A subset of these <b>datasets</b> representing the existing data analysis challenges is described below. For comparison against manual gating, the FlowCAP-I project has released five <b>datasets,</b> manually gated by human analysts, {{and two of them}} gated by eight independent analysts. The FlowCAP-II project included three <b>datasets</b> for binary classification and also reported several algorithms that were able to classify these samples perfectly. FlowCAP-III included two larger <b>datasets</b> for comparison against manual gates as well as one more challenging sample classification dataset. As of March 2013, public release of FlowCAP-III was still in progress. The <b>datasets</b> used in FlowCAP-I, II, and III either have a low number of subjects or parameters. However, recently several more complex clinical <b>datasets</b> have been released including a dataset of 466 HIV-infected subjects, which provides both 14 parameter assays and sufficient clinical information for survival analysis.|$|E

30|$|Based {{on these}} {{performance}} evaluation, the accuracy for KTH <b>dataset</b> {{is close to}} other methods. For the UCF <b>dataset,</b> the differences are higher. There are two main reasons. Firstly, the proposed 3 SMF feature is a holistic feature to representation video. The background of KTH <b>dataset</b> is simple, monotonous and uniformity. And from the confusion matrix in Table  3, we find the classification error occurred mainly in “running” category. This action is very similar with “jogging”. Different with KTH <b>dataset,</b> the special background of UCF <b>dataset</b> is related to respective action category. So the discriminative power of 3 SMF for KTH <b>dataset</b> is weaker compared with UCF <b>dataset.</b> Therefore, the improvement of our method of UCF <b>dataset</b> is better than KTH <b>dataset.</b> On the other hand, {{the accuracy of the}} existing algorithm for KTH <b>dataset</b> has exceeded 96  %, while only 94  % for UCF <b>dataset.</b> Further improvement has greater challenge in the case of higher accuracy.|$|R

25|$|The {{instrumental}} temperature record {{does not}} cover the entire globe: there are areas of incomplete or missing data, particularly in polar regions and parts of Africa. The main temperature <b>datasets</b> take different approaches to allowing for this: HadCRUT does not extrapolate, and assumes that the global mean applies. When these regions have a different trend to the global average as at present, this causes a bias in the result which understates overall warming. The other <b>datasets</b> interpolate, producing differing trends. A 2014 study introduced a more sophisticated method of Kriging from the UAH satellite dataset, and found that this considerably reduced the hiatus.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Sequential pattern mining is an {{important}} data mining problem with broad applications. Most of the previously developed sequential pattern mining methods, such as SPAM and SPADE, explore a candidate generation-and-test approach [12] which reduces the number of candidates to be examined. In this paper, we have implemented SPADE, SPAM and Prefixspan algorithm on the two databases. One database is sign database which is taken from ASL (American sign language database) [11]. The second <b>dataset</b> is Kosarak <b>dataset</b> containing 10000 sequences of click-stream data from an hungarian news portal. Sign <b>dataset</b> forms the dense <b>dataset</b> with few distinct items and Kosarak forms the sparse <b>dataset</b> with maximum distinct items. From the experimental results, SPADE performs better in both the dense as well as sparse <b>dataset</b> taken for simulation study. Performance of SPAM is worst when executed on sparse <b>dataset.</b> The number of sequences generated is same in both the <b>dataset</b> by all the mentioned algorithms. For dense <b>dataset</b> prefixsapn uses less memory whereas in sparse <b>dataset</b> it utilizes the most. In Dense <b>dataset</b> SPAM and SPADE are utilizing approximately constant memory. In sparse <b>dataset</b> minimum utilization of memory is by SPADE...|$|R
