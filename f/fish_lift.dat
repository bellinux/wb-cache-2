40|$|Abstract: Attraction of {{sturgeons}} to fishway entrances {{is poorly}} studied but observations on adult Shortnose Sturgeon, Acipenser brevirostrum, entering {{one of two}} <b>fish</b> <b>lifts</b> at Holyoke Dam, Connecticut River, MA, USA, indicate the benthic sturgeons need a bottom entrance with a submerged orifice if the water is deep. Sturgeons can pass upstream in nature-like or ramp fishways, or in technical fishways, like <b>fish</b> <b>lifts,</b> but not so good in traditional fish ladders. Keys to passing sturgeons in <b>fish</b> <b>lifts</b> is 1) attracting fish to the entrance by induced currents, 2) operating the lift during the seasonal (and daily diel period) of migration, 3) cycling the crowder trap within the time period fish will remain at the barrier without departing, and 4) designing the appropriate lift hopper. Adults have a moderate swimming ability and can ascend fish ladders, but they ascend best when the fish ladder design enables them to continuously swim upstream. Unfortunately, most fish ladders (e. g., pool 2 ̆ 6 weir, vertical slot) have cross walls that prevent sturgeons from continuously swimming upstream: {{an important aspect of}} their swimming style. Also, observations in an artificial ladder showed a series of ascents and descents before fish {{reached the top of the}} ladder. This suggests that any ladder for sturgeons should allow fish to descend without injury and loss of upstream ascent drive. Experiments with several species of sturgeons in a prototype sidebaffle ladder allowed fish to swim continuously during ascent and did not harm them during descent. Fish moved freely upand downstream like they might use a seminatural channel. Plans are to install the prototype at a dam in 2015 or 2016 to field test the design...|$|R
5000|$|The Conowingo Dam, and to {{a lesser}} extent the Holtwood and Safe Harbor Dams further upstream, stopped migratory fish species, {{especially}} American shad, from swimming further up the Susquehanna River to spawn. In 1984, a fish capture feature was added at Conowingo and shad were trucked upstream above all three dams and released. This program ended in 1999. A <b>fish</b> <b>lift</b> was installed in 1991. All three dams completed installation of fish lifts in time for the 2000 season. During the 2000 migration season, 153,000 American shad passed through the Conowingo <b>fish</b> <b>lift.</b> [...] "However, passage rates of shad from Conowingo to Holtwood have been only 30 to 50 percent, suggesting that fish are having difficulty moving upstream in the waters of the Conowingo pool." ...|$|E

50|$|Fish {{may move}} through sluices safely, but when these are closed, fish will seek out {{turbines}} {{and attempt to}} swim through them. Also, some fish {{will be unable to}} escape the water speed near a turbine and will be sucked through. Even with the most fish-friendly turbine design, fish mortality per pass is approximately 15% (from pressure drop, contact with blades, cavitation, etc.). Alternative passage technologies (<b>fish</b> ladders, <b>fish</b> <b>lifts,</b> <b>fish</b> escalators etc.) have so far failed to solve this problem for tidal barrages, either offering extremely expensive solutions, or ones which are used by a small fraction of fish only.

40|$|Abstract: Within {{the context}} of {{designing}} a fish passage, engineers and planers are provided with numerous standardized constructions methods including the respective assessment criteria to ensure that fish are able to migrate at transverse structures. Due to individual spatial conditions and boundaries, {{there is a need}} for special constructions at various locations. Because of lack of design specifications or lack of monitoring experience in the planning stage, the functionality of new systems and construction methods is not proven. Comprehensive functionality tests are therefore to be implemented. At the Baldeney weir an innovative <b>fish</b> <b>lift</b> is currently planned. The required system optimization and the verification of functionality were carried out on behalf of the Ruhrverband in a hybrid model approach, where physical and numerical models as well as ethohydraulic tests were linked. On the basis of a high resolution 3 D flow model and a physical model in a 1 : 3 scale, the flow behaviour within the <b>fish</b> <b>lift</b> and its components was analysed and optimized for different geometrical scenarios taking fish biological limits into account. The optimized geometry of the <b>fish</b> <b>lift</b> system was then placed into a situational similar model with a functional module of the <b>fish</b> <b>lift</b> and studied furthermore by using ethohydraulic tests. With the ethohydraulic tests, all phases of the fish passage (entry, lift passage and exit) could be examined with different fish species at different ages The applied methodology and the effectiveness of the hybrid model approach within {{the context of}} planning a fish passage is illustrated by results of the conducted studies for the <b>fish</b> <b>lift</b> system at Baldeney and the fish passage in Geesthach...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Different {{types of}} fishways have been {{implemented}} worldwide to mitigate the impact of dams on diadromous and potamodromous fish species. Among these, fish lifts stand as the most cost-effective mitigation measures for high dams. The present study examines fish passage through the Touvedo <b>fish</b> <b>lift</b> (River Lima, northwest Portugal) along a 2. 5 year period with the goal of: i) evaluating the conditions in terms of seasonal/daily fish movements patterns and to preliminary assess the overall efficacy of the facility (pre-treatment period, 1 year); ii) implementing specific measures to improve the efficacy previously recorded (6 months) and iii) evaluating the present conditions of the facility after measure implementation (post-treatment period, 1 year). Monitoring was continuously performed by {{using a combination of}} monthly video-recording and downstream electrofishing. A total of 3389 fish were transferred by the lift during the pre-treatment period, of which 89. 7 % corresponded to Iberian nase (54. 1 %) and European eel (35. 6 %), which migrated mainly during summer and beginning of autumn, independently from time of day. Mean overall efficacy was higher for potamodromous cyprinid species (0. 42 - 0. 44) and lower for the eel (0. 10). Differences between fish size, downstream and in the <b>fish</b> <b>lift,</b> were also noted. After implementing a set of specific measures, the post-monitoring annual period revealed a significant increase of eel abundance, which increased more than threefold (1207 to 3852 individuals), though the timing of movements remained similar as of the pre-treatment period. An overall increase in <b>fish</b> <b>lift</b> efficacy was also noted for eel (0. 21) and potamodromous cyprinids (0. 44 - 1. 35). Differences in fish size also decreased. The current work revealed that the use of the Touvedo <b>fish</b> <b>lift</b> by eels and medium-sized cyprinid species can be improved by reducing the gap between retention bars in the <b>fish</b> <b>lift</b> and by improving the attraction flow at the fish entrances...|$|E

40|$|The lower Susquehanna River {{has four}} {{hydroelectric}} dams with technical fishways constructed to pass American shad and other alosines.
