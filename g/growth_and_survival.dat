5|$|Another {{important}} role {{of the immune system}} is to identify and eliminate tumors. This is called immune surveillance. The transformed cells of tumors express antigens that are not found on normal cells. To the immune system, these antigens appear foreign, and their presence causes immune cells to attack the transformed tumor cells. The antigens expressed by tumors have several sources; some are derived from oncogenic viruses like human papillomavirus, which causes cervical cancer, while others are the organism's own proteins that occur at low levels in normal cells but reach high levels in tumor cells. One example is an enzyme called tyrosinase that, when expressed at high levels, transforms certain skin cells (e.g. melanocytes) into tumors called melanomas. A third possible source of tumor antigens are proteins normally important for regulating cell <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> <b>survival,</b> that commonly mutate into cancer inducing molecules called oncogenes.|$|E
5|$|Climate {{change may}} well affect populations of seabirds in the {{northern}} Atlantic. The most important demographic may {{be an increase in}} the sea surface temperature which may have benefits for some northerly Atlantic puffin colonies. Breeding success depends on there being ample supplies of food at the time of maximum demand, as the chick grows. In northern Norway the main food item fed to the chick is the young herring. The success of the newly hatched fish larvae during the previous year was governed by the water temperature, which controlled plankton abundance and this in turn influenced the <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> <b>survival</b> of the first-year herring. The breeding success of Atlantic puffin colonies has been found to correlate in this way with the water surface temperatures of the previous year.|$|E

This paper tests the {{hypothesis}} that the relationship between firm <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> firm <b>survival</b> can be characterised by an inverted U-shaped relation. This hypothesis is confirmed by our estimations. At the same time, the results indicate that the top of the inverted U-shaped relation occurs at very high growth rates. This suggests that for the large majority of enterprises, the relationship between firm <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> firm <b>survival</b> can be better described by a positive relationship rather than an inverted U-shaped relationship.

25|$|Introduced grazing {{animals can}} also affect soil {{condition}} through physical compaction and break-up {{of the soil}} caused by the hooves of animals and through the erosion effects caused by the removal of protective plant cover.

25|$|Colony {{founding}} {{can be done}} by {{an individual}} or in groups, known as pleometrosis. This joint effort of the co-foundresses contributes to the <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> <b>survival</b> of the incipient colony; nests founded by multiple queens begin the growth period with three times as many workers when compared to colonies founded by a single queen. Despite this, such associations are not always stable. The emergence of the first workers instigates queen-queen and queen-worker fighting. In pleometrotic conditions, only one queen emerges victorious, whereas the queens that lost are subsequently killed by the workers. The two factors that could affect the survival of individual queens are their relative fighting capabilities and their relative contribution to worker production. Size, an indicator of fighting capacity, positively correlates with survival rates. However, manipulation of the queen's relative contribution to worker production had no correlation with survival rate.|$|E
25|$|The main {{method of}} {{treatment}} for death from signaling-related diseases involves either increasing or decreasing the susceptibility of apoptosis in diseased cells, {{depending on whether the}} disease is caused by either the inhibition of or excess apoptosis. For instance, treatments aim to restore apoptosis to treat diseases with deficient cell death, and to increase the apoptotic threshold to treat diseases involved with excessive cell death. To stimulate apoptosis, one can increase the number of death receptor ligands (such as TNF or TRAIL), antagonize the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 pathway, or introduce Smac mimetics to inhibit the inhibitor (IAPs). The addition of agents such as Herceptin, Iressa, or Gleevec works to stop cells from cycling and causes apoptosis activation by blocking <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> <b>survival</b> signaling further upstream. Finally, adding p53-MDM2 complexes displaces p53 and activates the p53 pathway, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Many different methods can be used either to stimulate or to inhibit apoptosis in various places along the death signaling pathway.|$|E

Mast cells express multiple regulatory subunits of class 1 (A) PI 3 Kinase (PI 3 K) including p 85 Î±, p 85 Î², p 50 Î±, and p 55 Î±. While it is known that PI 3 K plays an essential role in mast cells; the precise mechanism by which these regulatory subunits impact specific mast cell functions including <b>growth,</b> <b>survival</b> <b>and</b> cycling are not known. We show that loss of p 85 Î± impairs the <b>growth,</b> <b>survival</b> <b>and</b> cycling of mast cell progenitors (MCp).

Functional categorization based on DAVID bioinformatics tool and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software relates the altered genes due to lack of p 85 Î± to transcription, cell cycle, cell survival, cell adhesion, cell differentiation, and signal transduction.

2500|$|Soil {{moisture}} {{is another}} important factor influencing soil respiration. Soil respiration is low in dry conditions and increases to a maximum [...] at intermediate moisture levels until it begins to decrease when moisture content excludes oxygen. This allows anaerobic conditions to prevail and depress aerobic microbial activity. Studies have shown that soil moisture only limits respiration at the lowest and highest conditions with a large plateau existing at intermediate soil moisture levels for most ecosystems. Many microorganisms possess strategies for <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> <b>survival</b> under low soil moisture conditions. Under high soil moisture conditions, many bacteria take in too much water causing their cell membrane to lyse, or break. This can decrease the rate of soil respiration temporarily, but the lysis of bacteria causes for a spike in resources for many other bacteria. This rapid increase in available labile substrates causes short-term enhanced soil respiration. Root respiration will increase with increasing soil moisture, especially in dry ecosystems; however, individual species root respiration response to soil moisture will vary widely from species to species depending on life history traits. Upper levels of soil moisture will depress root respiration {{with the exception of}} wetland plants, which have developed specific mechanisms for root aeration. Soil moisture levels regulate root respiration, which is essential for nitrogen uptake.|$|E

[...] Females continuously evaluate their partners' condition based on foot color. In one experiment, males whose partners had laid a first egg in the nest had their feet dulled by make-up. The female partners laid smaller second eggs a few days later. As duller feet usually indicate a decrease in health and possibly genetic quality, it is adaptive for these females to decrease their investment in the second egg. The smaller second eggs contained less yolk concentration, which could influence embryo development, hatching success, and subsequent chick <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> <b>survival.</b> In addition, they contained less yolk androgens.
