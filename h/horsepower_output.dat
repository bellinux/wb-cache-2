25|$|The Wankel engine has the {{advantages}} of compact design and low weight over {{the most commonly used}} internal combustion engine employing reciprocating pistons. These advantages have given rotary engine applications in a variety of vehicles and devices, including: automobiles, motorcycles, racing cars, aircraft, go-karts, jet skis, snowmobiles, chainsaws, and auxiliary power units. The point of power to weight has been reached of under one pound weight per <b>horsepower</b> <b>output.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{successor}} to the ZR-1 made its debut in 2001 as the Z06, giving {{a nod to the}} high-performance Z06 version of the C2 Corvette of the 1960s. Instead of a heavy, double-overhead cam engine like in the ZR-1, the Z06 used a high-output, tuned version of the standard LS1 Corvette engine (designated LS6), which initially produced 385hp (287kW). Although its total <b>horsepower</b> <b>output</b> was less than that of the last ZR-1, the Z06 was much lighter, and could out-perform the ZR-1 in every category except top speed. It also cost substantially less money than the ZR-1. The Z06 curb weight totaled 3,118lbs.|$|E
25|$|As the {{throttle}} is moved to higher power notches, the fuel rate {{to the prime}} mover will increase, resulting in a corresponding increase in RPM and <b>horsepower</b> <b>output.</b> At the same time, main generator field excitation will be proportionally increased to absorb the higher power. This will translate into increased electrical output to the traction motors, with a corresponding increase in tractive force. Eventually, depending on {{the requirements of the}} train's schedule, the engine driver will have moved {{the throttle}} to the position of maximum power and will maintain it there until the train has accelerated to the desired speed.|$|E
5000|$|In 18000, <b>output</b> <b>{{horsepower}}</b> is 24% {{of total}} horsepower and in 18100, <b>output</b> <b>horsepower</b> is 33% of total horsepower. This suggests that 18100 had the higher thermal efficiency but, in practice, 18000 had the higher thermal efficiency. The horsepower figures should, therefore, be regarded with some scepticism.|$|R
50|$|Specific {{output is}} a measure of engine performance. It {{describes}} the efficiency of an engine in terms of the brake <b>horsepower</b> it <b>outputs</b> relative to its displacement. The measure enables the comparison of differently sized engines and is usually expressed as kilowatts or horsepower per litre or per cubic inch. Generally, forced induction engines out-perform naturally aspirated engines of the same size by this measure.|$|R
50|$|The {{needs of}} the growing firm demanded both larger {{quarters}} and an improved power source. In 1828 Baldwin devised and constructed his first steam engine, a stationary device that produced 5 <b>horsepower</b> of <b>output</b> and remained in use in the shop for four decades. Baldwin's engine {{was not only the}} most powerful of its day but also incorporated mechanical innovation to power rotary motion, which ultimately came to have application in transport, including marine engine design. The original engine still survives in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC.|$|R
2500|$|Once the {{manufacturing}} defects and corrosion damage were corrected, the R class {{proved to be}} a fine locomotive in its intended role of express passenger service, and individual R class locomotives were soon running upwards of [...] each per week. Dynamometer car testing showed they were capable of producing a maximum 1,840 drawbar horsepower (...) at , a significant improvement over the A2's [...] at [...] They quickly took over virtually all mainline passenger services previously operated by the A2 and passenger timetables were revised to take advantage of their higher performance, with cuts to journey times as high as 60 minutes. Although of similar size to the X class 2-8-2 goods locomotive, the R's more modern design features such as larger volume smokebox and better valve events courtesy of larger [...] diameter piston valves with long [...] travel contributed to its significantly higher <b>horsepower</b> <b>output</b> than the 1,400 drawbar <b>horsepower</b> (...) <b>output</b> of the X class.|$|E
2500|$|Even in its {{original}} form, the X class locomotive was a marked improvement on the C class in terms of performance. Comparative tests between prototype X27 and C class locomotive C18 revealed that the X developed an indicated <b>horsepower</b> <b>output</b> of [...] between , compared with [...] at [...] for the C. With a later revised boiler design and other changes improving performance and increasing indicated horsepower {{to as much as}} , the X class was renowned for its ability to be driven extremely hard. As with the C class, it was also occasionally pressed into mainline passenger service on key intercity routes, particularly during Christmas and Easter peak times.|$|E
2500|$|Personal {{luxury cars}} are {{characteristically}} two-door coup√©s or convertibles with two-passenger or 2+2 seating. They are distinguished {{on the performance}} end from GT and sports cars by their greater emphasis on comfort and convenience. [...] Even though they usually contain higher horsepower engines and the necessary support systems for the higher <b>horsepower</b> <b>output</b> (transmissions, tires, brakes, steering, etc.); these larger power trains usually only bring these vehicles back to the power-to-weight ratios {{that they would have}} had if their gross vehicle weights had not been increased to accommodate the installation of their luxury features and accessories. [...] On the luxury scale, by their appointments, features, and style, there is great variability within the market; however, this is not absolute but merely a general trend.|$|E
50|$|Up {{until the}} 1979 models, the {{performance}} of 400-equipped Firebirds could still be brought up to near pre-1970 levels by removing the catalytic converter and opening up the block off plate to make the hood scoop functional. Static compression ratios dropped in the early 1970s which crippled <b>horsepower</b> and torque <b>output.</b>|$|R
50|$|Engine {{power or}} {{horsepower}} is the maximum power that an engine can put out. It {{can be expressed}} in kilowatts or <b>horsepower.</b> The power <b>output</b> depends on the size and design of the engine, {{but also on the}} speed at which it is running and the load or torque. Maximum power is achieved at relatively high speeds and at high load.|$|R
50|$|Recent forced {{induction}} V6 engines {{have delivered}} <b>horsepower</b> and torque <b>output</b> comparable to contemporary larger displacement, naturally aspirated V8 engines, while reducing fuel consumption and emissions, {{such as the}} Volkswagen Group's 3.0 TFSI which is supercharged and directly injected, and Ford Motor Company's turbocharged and directly injected EcoBoost V6, {{both of which have}} been compared to Volkswagen's 4.2 V8 engine.|$|R
2500|$|The sixth {{generation}} Thunderbird {{debuted in}} the fall of 1971 as a 1972 model. With a [...] wheelbase, an overall length of [...] (growing to [...] by 1974), and a curb weight of [...] (over [...] when equipped with a [...] V8), it was the largest Thunderbird ever produced by Ford, sharing the body and frame of the Lincoln Mark IV. Matching the large size of the car were large engines, including a standard [...] V8 and an optional [...] V8 (standard after 1973). Though offering two of the largest displacement V8 engines ever installed in a production vehicle by Ford, the car's considerable weight combined with low <b>horsepower</b> <b>output</b> caused by restrictive emissions technology resulted in modest performance. As might also be expected from installing a large displacement V8 in a heavy car, fuel efficiency was poor. The big Thunderbirds were popular with sales peaking at over 87,000 units in 1973 in spite of the 1973 oil crisis, but sales had slumped to less than 43,000 by 1975. Finishing off the generation, sales saw an uptick to almost 53,000 units for 1976. Acknowledging increasing fuel prices and more stringent federal emissions standards, a new, down-sized Thunderbird would appear for 1977.|$|E
2500|$|The {{trial was}} {{successful}} with the locomotive {{noted for its}} clean running {{and the elimination of}} smoke, spark hazard and spark arrestor cleaning. With the grate automatically stoked via a tender-mounted conveyor screw and blower motor, it was now possible to harness the full steam-raising potential of the locomotive's boiler without the stamina of the fireman being a limiting factor. The steam requirements for both engine and booster were able to be met for unlimited periods at maximum steam pressure even against the action of both injectors. Comparative performance tests with black coal-fired X30 revealed that X32 was able to generate a drawbar <b>horsepower</b> <b>output</b> of [...] at , exceeding by 5 to 10% that which could be produced by X30 with good quality Maitland or Lithgow coals. The locomotive gained a reputation for both speed and dependability. On one occasion, X32 hauled a [...] load between Seymour and Melbourne in 105 minutes, where the working timetable for a full [...] load allowed 147 minutes. On 4 April 1951 it replaced a defective S class locomotive in hauling the Spirit of Progress from Wallan to Melbourne, taking 43 minutes to cover the same distance the S class-hauled train would normally cover in 40 minutes, despite having to start the train from standstill and running with a lower permissible maximum speed.|$|E

With the 6.2L V8 again exclusive to the Super Duty line, the 5.0L V8 was retuned for additional <b>horsepower</b> and torque <b>output.</b> As with its predecessor, no manual transmission is available, with a 6-speed automatic paired with all drivelines.|$|R

For the 2011 model year onwards, the powertrain was changed to the N55 single (twin-scroll) turbo inline-6 (making the same <b>horsepower</b> and torque <b>output,</b> but with lower fuel consumption and quicker turbo responsiveness), paired to a six-speed manual or optional 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. The short-lived 1 Series M Coupe retained the N54 biturbo inline-6, albeit in a higher state of tune.|$|R

5000|$|Energy {{is often}} {{measured}} in watt hours, BTUs, therms or calories {{rather than the}} SI joule. Residential and commercial electrical energy use is metered and billed in kilowatt hours, kW¬∑h, as in most metric countries. Fuel prices are mostly given in customary units, such as dollars per gallon, barrel, thousand cubic feet, or ton (short or long). Heating, cooling, and combustion are often measured in BTUs per hour or refrigeration tons and powerplant efficiency is often measured by its [...] "heat rate", in BTU per kW¬∑hour. The rated power of engines, electric motors, and power plant steam turbines is frequently measured in <b>horsepower.</b> Power plant <b>output</b> is generally expressed in megawatts.|$|R
50|$|Among {{the factors}} that caused delay {{was the lack of}} an {{adequate}} powerplant. While the prototype had used a standard Henry J drivetrain, even Kaiser himself realized that a sports car needed more power than that engine could offer. Kaiser engineers had developed an overhead-valve V8 engine but the company had lacked the money to build it. Kaiser had then turned to Oldsmobile but the price for its 303-cubic-inch Rocket V8 became prohibitive when Olds raised its price halfway through negotiations. For the Darrin, Kaiser engineers modified a Henry J engine, giving it a high compression aluminum head, a hotter camshaft and a three-carburetor set-up. These changes added 25 <b>horsepower</b> to the <b>output</b> but increased valve and piston damage and affected drivability negatively.|$|R
5000|$|Along {{with the}} name change, came other major {{improvements}} and tweaks for the final model year of the conventional cab pickups. Single-point electronic throttle-body fuel injection (TBI) was introduced on GM's full-size pickups, with new electric fuel pumps and high-pressure fuel lines. In addition, a [...] "smart" [...] powertrain control module (PCM) was also introduced, which controlled the fuel injection system, fuel-to-air burn ratio, engine ignition timing, and (if equipped with an automatic transmission) the Turbo Hydra-Matic's turbine torque converter clutch. The 5.7 L 350 cubic inch pushrod V-8 {{was introduced to the}} order books for R-Series and V-Series half-ton class pickups, with the new TBI fuel injection system. <b>Horsepower</b> and torque <b>output</b> was increased to 210 hp, and 300 lb-ft of torque.|$|R

Hydrogen-oxygen and storable propellants were considered for the hot gas supply. All APU's were required to be self contained with respect to dissipating internally generated heat. These five systems were evaluated relative to a consistent criteria. The system supplied with high pressure gaseous hydrogen and oxygen was recommended as the best approach. It included a two-stage pressure-compounded partial-admission turbine, a propellant conditioning system with recuperation, a control system, and a gearbox. The gearbox output used was 240 HP. At {{the close of the}} study a 400 HP level was considered more appropriate for meeting the prime shuttle vehicle needs, and an in-depth analysis of the system at the 400 HP output level was recommended...|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "boiler horsepower" [...] was {{originally}} {{developed at the}} Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition in 1876, where the best steam engines of that period were tested.

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 Oxides of {{nitrogen}} are a concern as effluents to atmospheres because {{they participate in}} photochemical reactions which produce smog, because they attenuate sunlight which gives the atmosphere a reddish brown cast, and because of their toxic properties and the health hazards associated with the photochemical products they produce. Oxides {{of nitrogen}} are formed during the heterogeneous combustion of the diesel engine. When the locally overlean regions are subjected to high temperatures, nitric oxide (NO) is formed from the nitrogen and oxygen in the air. Nitrogen dioxide (NO‚ÇÇ) is formed slowly from the nitric oxide. The concentration of oxides of nitrogen formed {{is a function of}} the fuel-air ratio; the concentration magnitude is limited at low fuel-air ratios by the peak-cycle temperature of combustion and at high fuel-air ratios by the amount of excess air available. Oxides of nitrogen were measured by the spectrophotometric method, which was originally conceived by California Research Corporation. An instrument based on this method was built at this institution by Douglas E. Johnson and was modified and developed as a part of this thesis. The tests were conducted by setting the engine to initial conditions of speed and load close to peak power but below the exhaust smoke point. This initial run was made without any recirculation. The subsequent runs allowed increasing amounts of recirculated gas to flow to the engine intake; the engine speed was maintained constant by varying the load on the engine. The quantity of recirculation was independently varied and the temperature, which was dependent on the quantity of recirculation, was allowed to vary simultaneously. The results of these recirculation tests, which allowed both recirculation variables to increase simultaneously, show that the concentration of oxides of nitrogen in the exhaust gas remained essentially constant, at 300 parts per million (ppm), up to eight percent of exhaust gas recirculation from which the concentration increased rapidly to 700 ppm at 11 percent of exhaust gas recirculation. Increasing the percent of exhaust recirculation from zero to 11 percent caused the fuel-air ratio to increase from 0. 050 to 0. 065. The engine performance parameters were also affected by the exhaust recirculation. The <b>horsepower</b> (hp) <b>output</b> decreased from 32 hp at zero percent recirculation to 27. 7 hp at 11 percent recirculation, a decrease of 12. 5 percent. The exhaust smoke intensity decreased slightly between zero and about four or five percent recirculation but then increased rapidly becoming objectionable before reaching 11 percent recirculation. The temperature of the exhaust gas in the exhaust stack remained essentially constant at 1, 000 ¬∞ F from zero to seven percent recirculation and then increased to 1, 100 ¬∞ F at 11 percent recirculation. Concentrations of carbon monoxide, 0. 1 percent, and unburned hydrocarbons, 20 ppm, were not substantially affected by the recirculated exhaust; carbon dioxide concentrations increased from 9. 6 percent at zero percent recirculation to 11. 6 percent at 11 percent exhaust recirculation. These tests show that there are no reductions in concentration of oxides of nitrogen to be gained by recirculation of exhaust gas, as conducted in the manner of these tests. In addition, the engine parameters of horsepower and smoke intensity were not benefited; the concentration of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons was virtually unaffected, and the concentration of carbon dioxide increased by two percent. It is recommended that further studies of diesel exhaust recirculation be conducted under conditions where the recirculation temperature is held to a low constant value, because theory and earlier work, under unknown operating conditions, indicate that oxides of nitrogen can be reduced by exhaust gas recirculation...|$|R
