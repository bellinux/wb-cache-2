40|$|In {{this study}} of body {{temperatures}} (Tb) in free ranging dromedary camels, we found that bulls in rut start the days cooler. <b>Daily</b> <b>minima</b> during rut averaged 0. 6 °C lower than at other times (95 % CI 0. 27 – 0. 94 °C) and daily maxima averaged 0. 45 °C higher (95 % CI − 0. 01 to – 0. 91 °C), increasing the daily Tb cycle. Knut Schmidt-Nielsen described a similar pattern in captive dromedaries deprived of water in hot conditions, which he interpreted as a strategy to conserve water. Our observations were made in winter and with water freely available. Dromedaries can apparently employ heterothermy {{for more than just}} water conservation. In the strenuous daily contests between rival bulls in rut, a lower Tb early in the day should extend the time for which a contestant can challenge or defend before heat stress becomes a problem. Calculations show that lowering Tb by even 0. 6 °C extends that time by more than 30 min, and many <b>daily</b> <b>minima</b> during rut were lower than that. Because the eventual winner of contests gains or retains a herd of females, we speculate that cooler Tb at the start of daily contests confers an advantage which translates directly into increased reproductive success...|$|R

40|$|Assessments {{of climate}} change and food {{security}} often do not consider changes to crop production {{as a function of}} altered pest pressures. Evaluation of potential changes may be difficult, in part, because management practices are routinely utilized in situ to minimize pest injury. If so, then such practices, should, in theory, also change with climate, although this has never been quantified. Chemical (pesticide) applications remain the primary means of managing pests in industrialized countries. While a wide range of climate variables can influence chemical use, <b>minimum</b> <b>daily</b> temperature (lowest 24 h recorded temperature in a given year) can be associated with the distribution and thermal survival of many agricultural pests in temperate regions. The current study quantifies average pesticide applications since 1999 for commercial soybean grown over a 2100 km North-South latitudinal transect for seven states that varied in <b>minimum</b> <b>daily</b> temperature (1999 - 2013) from - 28. 6 °C (Minnesota) to - 5. 1 °C (Louisiana). Although soybean yields (per hectare) did not vary by state, total pesticide applications (kg of active ingredient, ai, per hectare) increased from 4. 3 to 6. 5 over this temperature range. Significant correlations were observed between <b>minimum</b> <b>daily</b> temperatures and kg of ai for all pesticide classes. This suggested that <b>minimum</b> <b>daily</b> temperature could serve as a proxy for pesticide application. Longer term temperature data (1977 - 2013) indicated greater relative increases in <b>minimum</b> <b>daily</b> temperatures for northern relative to southern states. Using these longer-term trends to determine short-term projections of pesticide use (to 2023) showed a greater comparative increase in herbicide use for soybean in northern; but a greater increase in insecticide and fungicide use for southern states in a warmer climate. Overall, these data suggest that increases in pesticide application rates may be a means to maintain soybean production in response to rising <b>minimum</b> <b>daily</b> temperatures and potential increases in pest pressures...|$|R
