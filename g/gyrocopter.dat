5|$|Once the Kongs collect all DK coins, {{they give}} the coins to Funky, who in {{exchange}} gives them a <b>gyrocopter.</b> The duo then finds an enigmatic creature called the Banana Bird Queen, who is bound to a barrier cast by K. Roolenstein. She tells the Kongs that she can only be freed if her separated children are returned to her, and that she will rid the land of K. Rool if she is freed. The Kongs find each of her children in a cave, {{where one of the}} birds is trapped in an egg which hatches when the Kongs complete a Simon-like memory game. After rescuing them and completing a large trade sequence between the Brothers Bear, the Kongs return the children to the Queen. The Queen and her children all sing, annihilating the barrier. The Queen proceeds to chase K. Rool, who is fleeing in a hovercraft. When she catches up to him, she drops a giant eggshell on top of him, which Dixie and Kiddy land on. The Kongs repeatedly knock on the shell, annoying K. Rool.|$|E
25|$|On December 27, 2011 around 12:45 pm, a <b>gyrocopter</b> crashed upon {{landing on}} runway 3.

50|$|The Wombat <b>Gyrocopters</b> Wombat, {{sometimes}} called a Julian Wombat, is a British autogyro {{that was designed}} by Chris Julian and produced by Wombat <b>Gyrocopters</b> of St Columb, Cornwall, introduced in 1991.

50|$|The Aviation {{division}} makes GFP gliders and powered gliders, <b>Gyrocopters</b> and Microlights.|$|R
50|$|<b>Gyrocopters</b> are {{designed}} to be as light as possible in order to attain flight and so most of the frame is built of canvas and wood, with thin bands of reinforcing metal. They are powered by a small, lightweight steam engine which uses a chain linkage system to drive the main rotor blades. As a result, <b>gyrocopters</b> are lightly armoured and rely on speed and maneuverability to stay out of trouble.|$|R
25|$|The basic Bensen <b>Gyrocopter</b> {{design is}} a simple frame of square {{aluminium}} or galvanized steel tubing, reinforced with triangles of lighter tubing. It is arranged so that the stress falls on the tubes, or special fittings, not the bolts. A front-to-back keel mounts a steerable nosewheel, seat, engine, and a vertical stabilizer. Outlying mainwheels are mounted on an axle. Some versions may mount seaplane-style floats for water operations.|$|E
25|$|Under license from Cierva in the 1920s and 1930s, the Pitcairn & Kellett {{companies}} made further innovations. Late-model autogyros {{patterned after}} Etienne Dormoy's Buhl A-1 Autogyro and Igor Bensen's designs feature a rear-mounted engine and propeller in a pusher configuration. The term Autogiro was a trademark of the Cierva Autogiro Company, and the term <b>Gyrocopter</b> {{was used by}} E. Burke Wilford who developed the Reiseler Kreiser feathering rotor equipped gyroplane {{in the first half}} of the twentieth century. The latter term was later adopted as a trademark by Bensen Aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{considerable}} {{interest from}} abroad, particularly from {{customers in the}} USA and Canada, no orders for the type were received and only the six development Ultra-lights were constructed before the programme was ultimately abandoned in 1959. A major factor in Fairey deciding to terminate work on the programme, aside {{from the lack of}} orders, was the limited resources available to the company, and the increasing levels of work on the then-promising Fairey Rotodyne, a much larger compount <b>gyrocopter</b> that also made use of tip jets and some of features of the Ultra-light.|$|E

25|$|An {{autogyro}} (from Greek αὐτός + γύρος, self-turning), {{also known}} as gyroplane, <b>gyrocopter,</b> or rotaplane, {{is a type of}} rotorcraft that uses an unpowered rotor in autorotation to develop lift, and an engine-powered propeller, similar to that of a fixed-wing aircraft, to provide thrust. While similar to a helicopter rotor in appearance, the autogyro's rotor must have air flowing through the rotor disc to generate rotation. Invented by the Spanish engineer Juan de la Cierva to create an aircraft that could fly safely at low speeds, the autogyro was first flown on 9 January 1923, at Cuatro Vientos Airfield in Madrid. De la Cierva's aircraft resembled the fixed-wing aircraft of the day, with a front-mounted engine and propeller in a tractor configuration to pull the aircraft through the air.|$|E
500|$|... "Nellie's" [...] {{battle with}} {{helicopters}} {{proved to be}} difficult to film. The scenes were initially shot in Miyazaki, first with takes of the <b>gyrocopter,</b> with more than 85 take-offs, 5 hours of flight and Wallis nearly crashing into the camera several times. A scene filming the helicopters from above created a major downdraft and cameraman John Jordan's foot was severed by the craft's rotor. The concluding shots involved explosions, which the Japanese government did not allow in a national park. So, the crew moved to Torremolinos, Spain, which was found to resemble the Japanese landscape.|$|E

500|$|There {{are three}} main events in Pilotwings 64 {{required}} to complete the game, {{each of which has}} its own objectives and unique flight controls centered around the Nintendo 64 controller's single analog stick. The first, hang gliding, usually requires the player to fly through a series of floating marker rings or snap a photograph of a particular piece of scenery before landing in a target area. The player's movement is affected by wind currents and altitude can be gained by flying through thermal columns. The second event is the [...] "Rocket Belt", a jet pack that allows the player to move and gain height as well as hover, tilt, and rotate in the air using the belt's equipped thrusters. Goals entail flying through rings or popping large balloons before landing. The third event, the <b>gyrocopter,</b> challenges the player to take off and land on a runway after completing objectives like navigating a path of rings or destroying targets with missiles. Pilotwings 64 also features several bonus events that are unlocked if the player performs well in the main missions. The player can also earn medals on many of these events. They include skydiving, a human cannonball event, and the [...] "Jumble Hopper", which grants the player special spring-loaded boots to be used in bouncing across the landscape to an end space. Lastly, Pilotwings 64 features a [...] "Birdman" [...] mode that puts the character in a bird suit and gives players the opportunity to freely explore the game's detailed, object-dense environments set among its four distinct islands. One of the islands is based on the United States, and has geographical replications of famous landmarks including the Statue of Liberty and Mount Rushmore and major cities such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York City.|$|E

2500|$|Emile Berliner named all his {{counter-rotating}} helicopters [...] "gyrocopters" [...] (<b>gyrocopter</b> {{was later}} {{used to describe}} a rotary-winged vehicle that operated on different principles). The first test rig was powered by two 30hp Adams-Farwell rotary engines. The second example capable of lifting a person was powered by a single 60hp engine. Emile initially intended his helicopter to have floats and to be used at low levels over water {{in case of an}} engine failure that would cause a forced landing. [...] A Popular Mechanics article of the time supposed that his invention would be used as a [...] "flying torpedo" [...] more capable than an aeroplane at holding rich cities for ransom.|$|E
