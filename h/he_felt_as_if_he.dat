25|$|Although {{already an}} {{accomplished}} practitioner, in interview Okabayashi Shōgen stated that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{had come to}} a technical road block in his training through which he could not pass. He could perform the techniques effectively but not at a speed necessary for them to be employed under the demands of real fighting. His teacher Hisa had become elderly and had suffered a dehabilitating stroke and so was moving to Tokyo to be cared for by his family. Okabayashi decided that he would give up the practise of Daitō-ryū. Hearing of this Hisa encouraged him rather to go study with Sōkaku's son, the current headmaster of the art, Tokimune Takeda, and gave him a letter of recommendation.|$|E
500|$|Francis Bacon met George Dyer in a Soho pub. According to Bacon [...] "George {{was down}} {{the far end}} of the bar and he came over and said 'You all seem to be having a good time, can I buy you a drink?'" [...] (Francis Bacon quoted in: Michael Peppiat, Francis Bacon: Anatomy of an Enigma, London 2008, p. 259). From that point on, Dyer became devoted to Bacon. He admired his intellect and power and was in awe of his self-confidence. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had found a purpose, as the {{prominent}} artist's companion. Dyer was then about thirty years old and had grown up in the East End of London in a family steeped in crime. He had spent his life drifting between theft, juvenile detention center and jail. Typical of Bacon's taste in men, Dyer was fit, masculine, and not an intellectual.|$|E
500|$|Chrisye {{began work}} on a {{rearrangement}} of Badai Pasti Berlalu in 1999 {{at the request of}} Musica Studios– although he felt that the original album was fine– and once again teamed up with Gutawa. The new album, which retained the title Badai Pasti Berlalu, cost Rp.800 million (US$95,000) to produce and promote, in part owing to the cost of employing an Australian orchestra, the Victorian Philharmonic Orchestra. After its release, the album sold well, breaking even within three months and selling 350,000 copies. The album led to Chrisye's second sold-out solo concert at the Plenary Hall of Jakarta Convention Centre, known as the Badai concert, and he received numerous offers to perform at venues throughout the country. He later told Kompas that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had reached a dead end, having tried all genres available. He continued performing, singing [...] "Indonesia Perkasa" [...] at the opening ceremony of the 15th National Games on 19 June 2000 in Sidoarjo, East Java.|$|E

5000|$|A cryptic line in Akutagawa's classic {{short story}} [...] "Rashōmon" [...] says 「旧記の記者の語を借りれば、『頭身の毛も太る』ように感じたのである。」 (To borrow {{a phrase from}} the writers of the chronicles of old, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> 'even the hairs {{on his head and}} body had grown thick'.) This is a {{reference}} to a line from the Konjaku Monogatarishū, the last part figuratively meaning that he was scared; <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> his hair was standing on end.|$|R
60|$|The room {{seemed to}} reel before Jimmy's eyes. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{a friend had}} wounded him in his tenderest feelings. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> some loved one had smitten him {{over the back of}} the head with a sandbag. For one moment, in which time stood still, his devotion to Ann wobbled. It was <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he had found her out in some terrible crime that {{revealed}} unsuspected flaws in her hitherto ideal character.|$|R
500|$|A {{number of}} Oliver Meeker's friends from Indianapolis {{joined the group}} before the party left Iowa. They crossed the Missouri River at the small Mormon {{settlement}} of Kanesville (today Council Bluffs, Iowa). Meeker recounted that, as {{he stood on the}} far side of the Missouri, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had left the United States. As they journeyed westward along the Platte River in Nebraska Territory, there were such large numbers traveling that they were never out of sight of the tens of thousands of other pioneers journeying west that year. Sometimes several wagons advanced side by side. The Meekers chose a slow, steady pace, unlike many who sought to rush along as quickly as possible. Piles of abandoned possessions lined the way, cast aside to lighten loads. [...] As the party went further west, they passed some of those who had hurried past them, and whose wagons had broken down or whose oxen had died as a result of failure to care for them properly. Disease was an ever-present risk; at the present site of Kearney, Nebraska, Oliver Meeker was stricken with illness. This led to a division of the group when most of Oliver's friends, including later Idaho Territory governor David W. Ballard, refused to wait. Oliver recovered after four days, and was one of the lucky ones—his brother later estimated that one in ten of those who took the Trail perished during the journey. Ezra Meeker remembered meeting one wagon train, slowly moving east against the flow of traffic. That group had made it as far as Fort Laramie (today in Wyoming) before losing the last of its menfolk, and the women and children turned back, hoping to regain their homes in the East. [...] He never learned if they made it. According to local historians Bert and Margie Webber, [...] "all of these deaths made a great impression on the young man".|$|E
2500|$|Gable was {{considered}} {{for the role of}} Tarzan in Tarzan the Ape Man, but lost out to Johnny Weissmuller's more imposing physique and superior swimming prowess. However, Gable's unshaven lovemaking with braless Jean Harlow in Red Dust (1932) soon made him MGM's most important male star. After the hit Hold Your Man (1933), MGM recognized the goldmine of the Gable-Harlow pairing, putting them in two more films, China Seas (1935; with Gable and Harlow billed above Wallace Beery) and Wife vs. Secretary (1936) with Myrna Loy and James Stewart. An enormously popular combination, on-screen and off-screen, Gable and Harlow made six films together, the most notable being Red Dust (1932) and Saratoga (1937). Harlow died during production of Saratoga. Ninety percent completed, the remaining scenes were filmed with long shots or the use of doubles like Mary Dees; Gable said that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were [...] "in the arms of a ghost".|$|E
2500|$|Vase with Zinnias and Geraniums (F241) {{reflects}} {{the influence of}} Adolphe Monticelli (1824–1886) in its vivid color and impasto paint. [...] Van Gogh admired, and later collected, Monticelli's work. [...] Van Gogh had been introduced by his brother Theo to Monticelli's still life work with flowers in Paris. [...] He admired Monticelli's use of color as an expansion of Delacroix's theories of color and contrast. [...] Secondly he admired the effect Monticelli created by heavy application of paint called [...] "impasto". It was partially Monticelli, from Marseilles, who inspired Van Gogh's southerly move to Provence in 1888. [...] He felt such kinship for the man, and desire to emulate his style, that {{he wrote in a}} letter to his sister Wil that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were [...] "Monticelli's son or his brother." [...] The first owner in the provenance of this painting is [...] "C.M. van Gogh Gallery, Amsterdam, The Netherlands", which was owned by Van Gogh's uncle and an art dealer, Cornelius Marinus van Gogh (1824–1908).|$|E
60|$|Tom bit {{his lips}} hard; <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the tears were rising, {{and he would}} rather die than let them.|$|R
6000|$|Stacey got {{his coat}} and hat. His heart was swollen with indignation. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{something}} fine were lost to him, and the land outside was so desolate! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, we're here, what 'll we do?" [...] queried Neale, more to himself. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> driven. And {{the mood}} he hated and feared was {{impinging}} upon his mind.|$|R
2500|$|In February 2004, NBC {{executive}} Marc Graboff informed Ross of the conversations, and he in turn ran {{the idea}} of waiting four more years to O'Brien, who was immediately receptive. Zucker, along with top late-night executive Rick Ludwin, met with Leno in March at his Burbank studio to discuss the contract extension, and explained the network's stance on handing over the show to O'Brien. While Leno quietly felt both disappointed and befuddled, he noted {{he did not want}} to see himself and O'Brien go through the same dilemma he and Letterman faced twelve years earlier, and agreed to the plans. His only request was that NBC wait to announce O'Brien's installment as host well after the extension, to which the executives agreed. While Leno handled the news professionally (to Zucker's relief), he soon headed to Tonight Show producer Debbie Vickers' office to let her know <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had just been fired. NBC's announcement of the renewal inevitably led to press speculation on O'Brien's fate; to that end, O'Brien and his team went with the charade, peppering interviews with unclear, vague statements on his future. On September 27, 2004, O'Brien officially signed on to become the next host of The Tonight Show; NBC allowed the first comment aside from the press release to come from Leno on that night's show. [...] "'Cause this, you know, this show is like a dynasty,” Leno said. “You hold it, and then you hand it off to the next person. And I don’t want to see all the fighting and all the 'Who’s better?' and nasty things back and forth in the press. So right now, here it is—Conan, it's yours! See you in five years, buddy!" ...|$|E

6000|$|The pen {{dropped from}} Dorian Gray's hand, and <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> his heart had {{suddenly}} stopped beating. [...] "A sailor?" [...] he cried out. [...] "Did {{you say a}} sailor?" ...|$|R
60|$|Instantly a {{flood of}} warm blood deluged his face and breast; {{at the same time}} <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> some dreadful weight were {{pressing}} him to death. Then consciousness forsook him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Will {{you tell}} me what you did hear?" [...] he asked after awhile, with seeming calm, though <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> his words must choke him, and her answer strike him dead.|$|R
60|$|Mr Wegg replied, with literal exactness, that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{had had a}} turn.|$|E

60|$|Now {{that he knew}} {{something}} of their small troubles, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it would please Miss Kent, and be a good joke, to do {{his share of the}} pretty work she had begun.|$|R
6000|$|... 'A {{morning of}} Greek would be insupportable,' thought he; and yet <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the fetters of fate were being fast bound around him, {{when he heard}} his father {{inviting}} James to ride with him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{suppose she}} would have grieved much if he had," [...] said Clemantiny sarcastically, all the while {{watching}} Chester, until <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she were boring into his very soul and reading all his past life.|$|R
60|$|Pony {{said he was}} {{not sick}} at all; just tired; and that was true; <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> never wanted to get up again.|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{beautiful}} {{everything is}} to-day!" [...] he said, {{as he stepped}} to her side. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had said, [...] "How beautiful you are!" ...|$|E
60|$|Not {{until he}} was some {{distance}} away did he draw a deep breath. Somehow <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had just emerged from a prison cell.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were his wife's body that was lying there. But the run had freshened his wits {{and he saw}} that the {{mischief}} might be repaired. He pulled vigorously at the night-bell.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is he, then, such {{a splendid}} young fellow!" [...] asked the seaman, {{with just the}} {{slightest}} touch of bitterness in his tone, for <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> a rock something like Gibraltar had been laid on his heart.|$|R
60|$|Heartily did Ellen exclaim, 'Well, {{that is a}} nice gentleman!' and as heartily did Alfred reply. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> a {{new light}} had come in on his life, and Mr. Cope had not said one word about patience.|$|R
6000|$|... "He told me <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{owed it to}} us to gain {{something}} for himself, since I had given up the Randall to gratify him--a pretty sort of gratification." ...|$|E
60|$|His {{leaning against}} the chimney-piece {{reminded}} him of the night with the whelp. It was the self-same chimney-piece, and somehow <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were the whelp to-night. He could make no way at all.|$|E
60|$|Then they quickened their pace, and capered for joy at {{the thought}} of the savory banquet at which they hoped to be guests. But Eurylochus told them that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were walking in a dream.|$|E
60|$|Billy {{was silent}} a moment. To him life seemed {{a large and}} generous thing. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> his arms ached from {{inability}} to compass it all, and he began, haltingly at first, to put his feeling into speech.|$|R
6000|$|Hereward was silenced. His men shrunk {{back from}} him. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> God, and the Mother of God, and St. Guthlac, {{and all the}} host of heaven, were {{shrinking}} back from him likewise. He turned to supplications, compromises,--what else was left? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{suppose it}} cannot be helped,' sighed Felix; 'but my father--' {{and as he}} recollected the desire to take his {{brothers}} away from Mr. Ryder, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> his chosen guardian had been false to his trust, out of pity and enthusiasm.|$|R
