5|$|Since {{the breakup}} of the Soviet Union a few years earlier, the Russian economy had been slowly {{collapsing}} and the budget for space exploration was reduced by around 80%. Before and after Phase One, a great deal of Russia's space finances came from <b>flights</b> <b>of</b> astronauts from Europe and other countries, with one Japanese TV station paying $9.5 million to have one of their reporters, Toyohiro Akiyama, flown aboard Mir. By the start of Phase One, cosmonauts regularly found their missions extended to save money on launchers, the six-yearly <b>flights</b> <b>of</b> the Progress had been reduced to three, and there was a distinct possibility of Mir being sold for around $500 million.|$|E

5|$|It was {{intended}} for training and evaluation <b>flights</b> <b>of</b> active-duty pilots, and for training pilot cadets at Soviet Air Force flying schools.

5|$|Unlike Gravity Bone, Thirty <b>Flights</b> <b>of</b> Loving employs {{non-linear}} storytelling, {{forcing the}} player {{to piece together}} the narrative. During gameplay, objectives and guidance are provided through the player's interactions with objects.

Several optional actions, such as drinking alcohol, are available at several stages of the game.|$|E
5|$|A {{sequel to}} Gravity Bone, Thirty <b>Flights</b> <b>of</b> Loving, was {{announced}} {{as a reward}} for contributing to the Idle Thumbs podcast revival Kickstarter.

The game, though not a direct sequel in story to Gravity Bone, follows the main character in a heist with two other characters that goes very wrong. The title was critically acclaimed by reviewers, who called the very short but non-linear storytelling of Thirty Flights a novel use of the video game medium.|$|E
5|$|Access to the {{navigation}} was improved for traditional canal boats {{with the opening}} of the Runcorn and Weston Canal, which was completed in 1859. The canal left the Weston Canal at Weston Point, and provided a link to Runcorn Docks, near which two <b>flights</b> <b>of</b> locks connected to the Bridgewater Canal. This link was severed in 1966, when the Runcorn to Widnes road bridge was constructed. Half of the Runcorn and Weston Canal was filled in at the same time.|$|E

5|$|After an {{intensive}} planning, maintenance, and briefing period, {{the mission was}} scheduled for January 1, 1967. Poor weather caused a 24-hour delay, but even then, a solid overcast covered the North Vietnamese airbases at Phúc Yên, Gia Lam, Kép, and Cat Bai when the bogus strike force began arriving over the target area, five-minute intervals separating the <b>flights</b> <b>of</b> F-4s. Leading the first flight, Olds overflew the primary MiG-21 base at Phúc Yên and was on a second pass when MiGs finally began popping up through the cloud base. Although at first seemingly random in nature, it quickly {{became apparent that the}} MiGs were ground-controlled intercepts designed to place the supposed F-105s in a vise between enemies to their front and rear.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of a}} large {{attack on}} the Thanh Hóa Bridge on 3 April, the VPAF first {{appeared}} with two <b>flights</b> <b>of</b> four MiG-17s launched from Noi Bai airbase and shot down an F-8 Crusader for the cost of one of their own aircraft written off when it landed on a river bed after running short of fuel. A repeat the next day resulted in a classic dogfight with F-100 Super Sabres and F-105s fighting with more MiG-17s. In total, the USAF lost eleven aircraft to air and ground forces, while the VPAF lost three of their fighters.|$|E
