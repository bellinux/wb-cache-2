5|$|The game is {{presented}} from a single, 2D perspective, {{and the main}} objective involves Charlie the Chef baking a cake from evil, sentient ingredients. The five ingredients vary from Mixed Peel, Chunky Chocolate, Crafty Cheese, Sneaky Sugar and Colonel Custard, who will all <b>jump</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pantry and try and avoid the player whenever possible.|$|E
5|$|Like the spinner shark, the blacktip shark {{is known}} to leap {{out of the water}} and spin three or four times about its axis before landing. Some of these jumps are the end product of feeding runs, in which the shark corkscrews {{vertically}} through schools of small fish and its momentum launches it into the air. Observations in the Bahamas suggest that blacktip sharks may also <b>jump</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water to dislodge attached sharksuckers (Echeneis naucrates), which irritate the shark's skin and compromise its hydrodynamic shape. The speed attained by the shark during these jumps has been estimated to average 6.3m/s (21ft/s).|$|E

5|$|The girl, near death, {{is being}} ministered to by paramedics, fantasizing and being 'sexually aroused {{by a large}} python and writhing on a bed that lit up {{in time with the}} music, while {{surrounded}} by a group of bemused, semi-naked dancers'. When Steinman's manager saw it, he responded 'It's a porno movie!' The two-day shoot ran over schedule and budget, costing £35,000 an hour. Russell and Steinman even designed a sequence where a motorcyclist would cycle up the steps of a local church-tower, <b>jump</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> turrets at the top, and then explode; alas, the wardens of the church refused permission.|$|E
5|$|The train heist {{presented}} several challenges. The filmmakers {{were required}} to effectively purchase a length of working railroad for filming and the trains necessary to ride the tracks. Then trucks had to be built that could race the train and {{meet the needs of}} the heist itself. Lin also required that the cars being carried on the train be able to <b>jump</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> train at full speed. The scene took precise execution. The filmmakers chose to use cars they could cheaply replicate for the train heist—a 1972 De Tomaso Pantera, a 2007 Chevrolet Corvette GS Roadster, and a Ford GT40—to avoid the expense of replacing a genuine $2 million Ford GT40.|$|E
5|$|They then {{discover}} {{that they are in}} the sheriff's home, who returns soon after. Peter tries to pretend to be his wife while hiding in a closet, and he convinces the sheriff to let the fugitives go free. This exchange ends with the sheriff asking for a hug, which makes Peter <b>jump</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> closet and reveal the group. The entire police force then comes after them, until they are able to jump on a train and arrive in Quahog, only to be met by the sheriff and his deputies. Joe, however, had called ahead and arranged for the Quahog police department to arrive and rescue them. Joe then smashes the sheriff's vehicle, shoots him in the leg, and demands he leave Quahog.|$|E

25|$|Belugas are slower {{swimmers}} {{than the}} other toothed whales, such as the killer whale and the common bottlenose dolphin, because they are less hydrodynamic and have limited movement of their tailfins, which produce the greatest thrust. They frequently swim at between , although {{they are able to}} maintain a speed of 22km/h for up to 15 min. Unlike most cetaceans, they are capable of swimming backwards. Belugas swim on the surface between 5% and 10% of the time, while {{for the rest of the}} time they swim at a depth sufficient to cover their bodies. They do not <b>jump</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water like dolphins or killer whales.|$|E

25|$|Although the Cholas did not {{established}} a direct rule over Srivijayan court, Chola nobles were accepted graciously in Srivijayan court. In 1067 CE, a Chola prince named Divakara or Devakala was sent as a Srivijayan {{ambassador to the}} Imperial Court of China. The prince who was the nephew of Rajendra Chola later was enthroned in 1070 CE as Kulothunga Chola I. The humiliating defeat of Srivijayan Mandala against foreign invasion, has exposed the weaknesses and vurnerability of Srivijayan allegiance and alliance model. Among the disillusioned regional polities that <b>jump</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wagon, Kedah was the first that rebelled against the central Srivijayan authority. As the response, Srivijaya asked the Chola's help to punish and suppress Kedah rebellion. In 1068 CE, Virarajendra Chola launched a naval raid to help Srivijaya reclaim Kedah. Virarajendra reinstated the Kedah king {{at the request of}} the Srivijayan Maharaja and Kedah accepted the Srivijayan sovereignty. After this the Chola ruler Kulothunga Chola I became the ruler of Srivijaya which is mentioned in the Song chronicles. This peculiar event and the strange dynamic between Srivijaya and its former nemesis, the Cholas, has confused the Chinese court, that in their report mistakenly thought that the Chola was the vassal of Srivijaya.|$|E
500|$|Luxating patella {{is another}} health {{issue in the}} Pomeranian breed. It occurs when, through either {{malformation}} or trauma, the ridges forming the patellar groove in the knee are not prominent and are too shallow to allow the patella to properly sit securely. This can cause the patella to [...] "luxate" [...] (<b>jump</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> groove) sideways which will cause the leg to lock up with the foot off the ground. While the muscles are contracted the patella cannot return to the correct position. The initial pain {{is caused by the}} knee cap sliding across the ridges of the femur. Once out of position, the dog does not feel any pain caused by the slipped disc.|$|E

500|$|Angel Studios and Microsoft {{included}} regular cars {{in addition}} to the [...] "overpowered Italian sports cars" [...] often seen in racing games. The developers obtained permission from manufacturers to use the likenesses of selected vehicles. Microsoft received authorization from Volkswagen [...] for the New Beetle, and Ford, for the Mustang, and the F-350 Super Duty. The decision to make only half the cars available at the outset was intended to promote a sense of competition. Microsoft staff asked Angel Studios employees to prevent players from hitting pedestrians. Angel Studios (after deciding against rendering pedestrians in two dimensions) developed 3D pedestrian models that could run and <b>jump</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way. Midtown Madness included an option to remove pedestrians, as they do not alter gameplay but may affect system performance when in a group; consequently, the game does not require a 3D graphics card.|$|E
500|$|Porpoises {{have two}} {{flippers}} on the front, and a tail fin. Although porpoises {{do not possess}} fully developed hind limbs, they possess discrete rudimentary appendages, which may contain feet and digits. Their flippers, for example, contain four digits. Porpoises are fast swimmers in comparison to seals, which typically cruise at 5–15 kn, or Dall's porpoise, in comparison, can travel at speeds up to [...] The fusing of the neck vertebrae, while increasing stability when swimming at high speeds, decreases flexibility, {{making it impossible for}} them to turn their head. When swimming, they move their tail fin and lower body up and down, propelling themselves through vertical movement, while their flippers are mainly used for steering. Flipper movement is continuous. Some species log out of the water, which may allow then to travel faster, and sometimes they porpoise out of the water, meaning <b>jump</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water. Their skeletal anatomy allows them to be fast swimmers. They have a very well defined and triangular dorsal fin, allowing them to steer better in the water. Unlike their dolphin counterparts, they are adapted for coastal shores, bays, and estuaries.|$|E

2500|$|Only {{the upper}} flight deck crew {{members of the}} B-52C have {{ejection}} seats that eject them upwards. The seats of the pilot, copilot, and electronic warfare officer (a navigator also trained in electronic warfare) function at any altitude, {{as long as the}} airspeed is at least , which is the minimum required to inflate their blast propelled parachutes. The lower-deck crew members eject on a downward track. Hence, the navigator and radar navigator cannot safely eject at altitudes less than [...] Spare crew members do not have an ejection seat at all. They must use parachutes and either <b>jump</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> navigators' hatch after the navigators have ejected or drop out of the aircraft's door.
