40|$|How {{agricultural}} policies {{affect the}} environment is within ecological economics. The EU Commission `Mid-Term Review of CAP of Agenda 2000 ' of July 2002 proposed to separate production from direct payments, so that farmers would fully compete in the market, without gearing production to the trade-distorting subsidies. The decoupled direct payment to each farm will be conditional upon cross-compliance with the environmental, food safety, animal health and welfare, and occupational safety standards. MTR maintains extra set-aside payment for normal land to avoid overproduction, but no longer for marginal land. This paper suggests not to set aside normal land, because overproduction would be prevented by decoupling; normal land is less environmentally sensitive, and the direct payment would be enough for farmers {{to keep it in}} a good agricultural condition; setting-aside normal land would cost money, and make it unavailable for full-time farmers to achieve economies of scale. It recommends to set aside marginal land which is more environmentally sensitive, and the direct payment may not be enough for farmers to keep it in a <b>good</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>condition.</b> It advises to gradually convert marginal land back to the nature forever, give a conversion payment to its owners to keep it in a good environmental condition, and pursue non-cereal agriculture and off-farm activities. It advocates a tax on those farmers who refuse to keep a good agricultural or environmental condition on the set aside or converted marginal land for maximally two years, and forced land sale afterwards, which would be less harsh than expropriation.

According to the author of this article, this stability consists of two elements: ensuring the agricultural producer continuity of possession and enjoyment of the profits as well as guaranteeing manufacturing capacity of the subject of the agricultural lease. The article presents, among other things, the assessment of the influence of legal solutions included in Act of 16 September 2011 on changing Act on the management of agricultural property of the State Treasury on stability of the agricultural lease. It also analyzes questions relating to lease of private land and lease of land from the units of local governments. Moreover, the article focuses on the instruments protecting the manufacturing capacity of the subject of the lease, including EU regulations that make the obtaining of financial support subject to meeting numerous requirements concerning the treatments and maintaining <b>good</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>condition.</b> The article also concentrates on the issues of amendments and improvements.

In 1633, during the Thirty Years’ War, there was an {{engagement}} at the earthworks in which the Imperial Army’s Spanish troops suffered a great onslaught from troops of the Union under command of Rhinegrave Otto, and were thereby forced to withdraw from the Palatinate, and the whole left bank of the Rhine. The Spaniards lost all their baggage in the ordeal, and perhaps worse, 1,500 mercenaries were taken prisoner. In 1635, Ulmet was burnt down by the Imperial Army’s Croatian mercenaries. Some of the inhabitants got to safety, along with their clergyman Suevas, at Lichtenberg Castle. All the inhabitants who did not make it to safety inside Lichtenberg Castle were murdered. By the time the war was over, the village was almost empty of people. The population then grew up again, but only slowly, mainly by the arrival of newcomers, but also because of the <b>good</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>conditions.</b> Fate delivered further blows in the late 17th century with King Louis XIV’s wars of conquest.

In the wake of the French Revolution and the French annexation of the lands on the Rhine’s left bank, the region’s administrative structure was altered on 23 January 1798. Most of the Unteramt of Ulmet was assigned to the Department of Sarre, the Arrondissement of Birkenfeld and the Canton of Kusel.

Environmental impacts are of more concern when ethanol production occurs in areas of high biodiversity value such as the Cerrado (Brazilian savanna). The Cerrado is a global biodiversity hotspot and an important breadbasket—at the same time, it is on a path to becoming the major sugarcane ethanol-producing region in Brazil. The main goal of this dissertation {{is to examine the}} impacts of sugarcane expansion on farmers’ land use decision processes in the Cerrado and to consider its consequences on biodiversity and the impacts of climate change. In the following chapters, land change dynamics are investigated using a combination of theory and methods from geography, GIScience, economics, and ecology. Chapter 2 presents an examination of the drivers for the sugarcane expansion. The findings suggest that the Cerrado attracted mills because of the <b>good</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>conditions,</b> affordable land prices, and favorable state-level fiscal incentive policies, while factors that have prevented traditional sugarcane-producing regions from meeting the increasing demand for ethanol. Chapter 3 develops a procedure to identify intensification and extensification responses at the field level. The main finding is that extensification is the main response. Additionally, this response has a higher probability of occurrence the farther an area is from a mill.

In order to focus the theme of this special issue of the Italian Journal of Agronomy, we must remember that on 26 th June 2003, EU farm ministers adopted a fundamental reform of the CAP and introduced a new single payment scheme (SPS, or Single Farm Payment) intended to change the way the EU supported its farm sector by removing the link between subsidies and production of specific crops. The Single Farm Payment is linked to meeting environmental, public, animal and plant health and animal welfare standards and the need to keep land in <b>good</b> <b>agricultural</b> and environmental <b>condition.</b> To gain funds from the SPS the Farmer has to cross comply - that is, to farm in an environmentally friendly way.

This GAEC standard was formulated to ensure a minimum level of land maintenance and to avoid the deterioration of habitats. To achieve these objectives it should be considered that a good vegetative development is strictly related to the care of the soil in which the plants grow. Erosion, organic matter and soil structure decay are the most commonly identified impacts for olive orchards, 30 % of which are localized in areas with difficult orographic conditions. In this sense, proper hydraulic and mechanical techniques, cover cropping, green manuring and timely pruning turns, are essential to minimize losses due to soil erosion, to limit the leaching of nutrients and to maintain the plant productivity. Furthermore, grinded pruning residues should be spread in situ and weeds, watersprouts and suckers should be periodically cut off in order to increase the atmospheric CO 2 sequestration and soil organic matter (OM) and to prevent wildfires risk and nutrients competition. The application of the standard 4. 3 requires further investigations, because, while numerous studies have shown that pruning is essential for the production, there are not enough data on the influence that practicing this technique at least every five years could have on habitats maintenance and on olive trees vegetative development.

40|$|The {{decoupling}} {{of direct}} payments from production represents a substantial {{reform of the}} Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Farmers are no longer required to produce commodities {{to be entitled to}} support but only to keep land in <b>Good</b> Environmental and <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Condition.</b> If output declines as a result, there is concern that landscape services produced jointly with commodities will also decline. The aim {{of this paper is to}} assess the long-term effects of the 2003 reform on farm structure, landscape mosaic and biodiversity for a sample of EU regions. Impacts are quantified using a spatial agent-based modelling approach by simulating agricultural development with links to indicators of landscape value. Our results demonstrate that eliminating the link between support payments and production has possible negative consequences for the landscape, but only under particular circumstances. It is shown that these effects could be offset by strengthening (Pillar II) agri-environmental schemes. Further the single payment scheme results in higher land rental prices which reduces its ability to achieve its goal of providing income security for farmers. Implications of these results for the direction of continued CAP reform are discussed. Copyright (c) 2009 The Authors. Journal compilation (c) 2009 The Agricultural Economics Society. ...|$|R

To investigate the potential impacts of the GAEC, we coupled a high resolution erosion model based on Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) with the CENTURY biogeochemical model (Land Use Policy, 50, 408 - 421; 2016). The Italian arable land was selected as a study area, since it is well-known to be highly sensitive to soil erosion. Multi scenario modelling approach was undertaken, i. e., i) a baseline scenario without scenario excluding GAEC (pre 2003 period); ii) a present scenario including the current GAEC standards (post 2003 period), and iii) a technical potential scenario assuming that the GAEC standards were applied to the entire Italian arable land. The results show a 10. 8 % decrease, from 8. 33 Mg ha- 1 yr- 1 to 7. 43 Mg ha- 1 yr- 1, in soil loss potential due {{to the adoption of}} the GAEC conservation practices (with respect to the baseline scenario). The technical potential scenario shows a 50. 1 % decrease in the soil loss potential (soil loss 4. 1 Mg ha- 1 yr- 1). With regard to the soil organic carbon (SOC), the GAEC application in the current scenario shown an overall soil organic carbon (SOC) gains, with about 17 % of the SOC variation related to avoided SOC transport by sediment erosion. The technical potential scenario suggests a potential gain up to 23. 3 Mt of C by 2020 with the full GAEC application. JRC. D. 6 -Knowledge for Sustainable Development and Food Securit...|$|R
