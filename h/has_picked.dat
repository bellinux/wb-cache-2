5|$|Njörðr is {{introduced}} in Skáldskaparmál within {{a list of}} 12 Æsir attending a banquet held for Ægir. Further in Skáldskaparmál, the skaldic god Bragi recounds the death of Skaði's father Þjazi by the Æsir. As {{one of the three}} acts of reparation performed by the Æsir for Þjazi's death, Skaði was allowed by the Æsir to choose a husband from amongst them, but given the stipulation that she may not see any part of them but their feet when making the selection. Expecting to choose the god Baldr by the beauty of the feet she selects, Skaði instead finds that she <b>has</b> <b>picked</b> Njörðr.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{contribution}} of agricultural sector to the state economy was on the decline in 2012–13, through {{the strength of the}} allied livestock sector, it <b>has</b> <b>picked</b> up from 7.03% (2011–12) to 7.2%. In the 2013–14 fiscal period, {{the contribution}} has been estimated at a high of 7.75%.

5|$|The {{application}} of gold on the shields, {{in contrast to}} its absence {{on the rest of}} the ceiling, serves to link the ceiling to some extent with the frescoes around the walls. In the latter, gold leaf has been applied lavishly to many details and in some of the frescoes, notably those by Perugino, has been most expertly used not just to detail the robes but to highlight the folds by subtle graduation in the density of golden flecks. It is this technique that Michelangelo <b>has</b> <b>picked</b> up on and carried a step further, inspired also perhaps by the medallions that appear on a Roman triumphal arch in Botticelli's episode from the Life of Moses, showing the Punishment of the Rebels.|$|E

25|$|The {{opportunity}} cost doctrine was first explicitly formulated by the Austrian economist Friedrich von Wieser {{in the late}} 19th century.

25|$|Sephardic {{music is}} the unique music of the Sephardic Jews. Sephardic music was born in medieval Spain, with canciones being {{performed}} at the royal courts.

25|$|Dunyasha – a housemaid. Like Lopakhin, she {{is another}} example of social {{mobility}} in Russia at the time. A peasant who is employed as the Gayev's chambermaid, Dunyasha is an attention seeker, making big scenes and dressing as a lady to show herself off. She is in some respects representative of the aristocracy's impotence, as a lowly chambermaid would not in the past have had the freedom to dress like a lady and flirt with the manservants. Although pursued romantically by Yepikhodov, she is in love with Yasha, attracted to the culture he <b>has</b> <b>picked</b> up in Paris.|$|E

25|$|After the visa-free {{arrangement}} was activated, border trade <b>has</b> <b>picked</b> up. Norwegians buy {{petrol and diesel}} for {{less than half the}} price in Norway. This is the border in Europe with largest difference in fuel price. Norwegians also buy some Russian products such as building material and some services like hair dressing. Products produced in EU, Japan etc. such as clothes and electronics are more expensive in Russia because of tolls so Russians often buy them tax-free in Kirkenes. There are restrictions on food import in both directions, especially meat, and alcohol may only be imported into Norway if staying in Russia more than 24 hours, so food and alcohol are less often traded, which otherwise are the most traded goods over the Sweden–Norway and Finland–Norway border.|$|E
25|$|Philadelphia {{has been}} a heavy Puerto Rican {{destination}} since the 1950s, though migration to the city <b>has</b> <b>picked</b> up and now Philadelphia {{has one of the}} fastest-growing Puerto Rican populations in the country. Puerto Ricans constitute over 75% of the Latino population in the city. Most Puerto Ricans live in the areas of North Philadelphia east of Germantown Avenue (eastern North Philadelphia), and to a lesser extant the Lower Northeast and Uptown sections of the city. In fact, the Fairhill section of Eastern North Philadelphia, particularly the blocks between 6th street and B street, north of York street and south of Erie avenue, have some of highest concentrations of Puerto Ricans in the country, with most blocks usually being around 85-90% Puerto Rican alone, with most of the remaining portion made up of Dominicans and African Americans. Increases in Latino immigration and migration have fueled the growth of El Centro de Oro in Fairhill.|$|E
