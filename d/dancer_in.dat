5|$|Inspired by Astaire, Donen took dance {{lessons in}} Columbia and {{performed}} at the local Town Theater. His family often traveled to New York City during summer vacations where he saw Broadway musicals and took further dance lessons.

Encouraged by his mother, he moved to New York City to pursue dancing on stage in the fall of 1940. After two auditions he was cast as a chorus <b>dancer</b> <b>in</b> the original Broadway production of Rodgers and Hart's Pal Joey, directed by the legendary George Abbott.

5|$|T. R. Rajakumari {{was chosen}} to play Chandralekha {{replacing}} Vasan's first choice, K. L. V. Vasantha. According to film historian Randor Guy, Vasan chose Rajakumari over Vasantha because she was leaving Gemini Studios for Modern Theatres in Salem, Tamil Nadu. In April 1947 N. S. Krishnan, who had been convicted in the Lakshmikanthan murder case, {{was released from prison}} on appeal; Vasan recruited Krishnan and T. A. Madhuram to play the circus artists who help Veerasimhan rescue Chandralekha from Sasankan. The script was rewritten, with scenes added to showcase the comic duo. Madurai Sriramulu Naidu and S. N. Lakshmi made their acting debuts in the film; Naidu had an uncredited role as a horseman, and Lakshmi was a <b>dancer</b> <b>in</b> the climactic drum-dance scene.|$|E
5|$|The {{parallels}} to the Fitzgeralds were obvious.

Though told she has no chance, she perseveres and after three years becomes the lead <b>dancer</b> <b>in</b> an opera company. Alabama becomes ill from exhaustion, however, and the novel ends when they return to her family in the South, as her father is dying.|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} year's {{film about}} nude dancers, Showgirls, was generally disliked, so filmmakers feared audiences would pre-judge Striptease on this basis. To avoid any association, advertisements {{were designed to}} make Striptease look more comedic than Showgirls, which was a drama. Besides the subject matter, Striptease and Showgirls did have two notable connections. The choreography in these films was by the same person, Marguerite Derricks. Both also featured performances by Rena Riffel, who plays a <b>dancer</b> <b>in</b> each. To promote the film, Moore appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman and a Barbara Walters special. In both cases, she danced or otherwise exhibited her body.|$|E
