This force was known as the Australian Imperial Force (AIF).|$|E

40|$|Gordon W. Allport (1937) {{considered}} the coherence of personality to {{be a matter}} of degree and, as such, an individual difference. Although considered by some to be the “central, unique charge” of personality psychology (Cervone 2 ̆ 6 Shoda, 1999, p. 3), the study of personality coherence has been dispersed across different theoretical communities. We review how personality coherence has been defined and measured within the following five contemporary theoretical communities: the multivariate community (who <b>focus</b> <b>upon</b> the individual’s profile of global trait dispositions), the social-cognitive community (who <b>focus</b> <b>upon</b> the individual’s contextualized self-structures), the personological community (who <b>focus</b> <b>upon</b> the individual’s unique and ongoing life story), the cybernetic community (who <b>focus</b> <b>upon</b> the individual’s goal hierarchy), and the organismic community (who <b>focus</b> <b>upon</b> the individual’s sense of self). We conclude by reflecting upon the extent to which the five perspectives converge upon an underlying self-epistemic function...|$|R

5|$|As the {{existing}} militia forces {{were unable to}} serve overseas under {{the provisions of the}} Defence Act 1903, an all-volunteer expeditionary force known as the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) was formed and recruitment began on 10 August 1914. The government pledged 20,000 men, organised as one infantry division and one light horse brigade plus supporting units. Enlistment and organisation was primarily regionally based and was undertaken under mobilisation plans drawn up in 1912. The first commander was Major General William Bridges, who also assumed command of the 1st Division. Throughout the course of the conflict Australian efforts were predominantly <b>focused</b> <b>upon</b> the ground war, although small air and naval forces were also committed.|$|E
5|$|Technically, the Kleinschmidt orthography <b>focused</b> <b>upon</b> morphology: {{the same}} derivational affix would {{be written in}} the same way in {{different}} contexts, despite its being pronounced differently in different contexts. The 1973 reform replaced this with a phonological system: Here, there was a clear link from written form to pronunciation, and the same suffix is now written differently in different contexts. The differences are due to phonological changes. It is therefore easy to go from the old orthography to the new (cf. the online converter) whereas going the other direction would require a full lexical analysis.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{immediately}} {{effort was}} <b>focused</b> <b>upon</b> selecting and identifying {{the officers and}} NCOs. To this end volunteers were called for amongst units that had already formed {{as part of the}} 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF) and from new recruits. At the end of November, 146 trainees reported to the Army School at Trentham, where even serving officers and NCOs were required to prove their suitability for positions in the new battalion. Concurrently, recruiting of men to fill the other ranks positions began in early October and within three weeks nearly 900 men had enlisted. The process was carried out by recruiting officers who worked closely with tribal authorities, and the recruits were restricted to single men aged between 21 and 35, although later married men were allowed to join, but only if they did not have more than two children of similar ages.|$|E
40|$|To {{what extent}} does a <b>focus</b> <b>upon</b> local news affect {{residents}} 2 ̆ 7 expressed attachment to their community? Albeit relatively unexplored in previous research, {{an examination of}} this effect might significantly improve social science understanding of attachment, {{a key element of}} community quality of life. This research examined the effect of a <b>focus</b> <b>upon</b> local news on community attachment using a conceptual model informed by three sociological approaches: linear-development, systemic model, and social capital. The model was evaluated by {{the extent to which it}} fit data gathered from a social survey of 860 adults living in rural areas within 10 -selected states. The results indicate that a <b>focus</b> <b>upon</b> local news has a strong direct effect on community attachment.

5|$|At {{the start}} of the war, Australia's {{military}} forces were <b>focused</b> <b>upon</b> the part-time militia. The small number of regular personnel were mostly artillerymen or engineers, and were generally assigned to the task of coastal defence. Due to the provisions of the Defence Act 1903, which precluded sending conscripts overseas, upon the outbreak of war it was realised that a totally separate, all volunteer force would need to be raised. The Australian Imperial Force (AIF) began forming shortly after the outbreak of war, officially coming into being on 15 August 1914. Upon formation, the AIF consisted of the 1st Division and the 1st Light Horse Brigade. As part of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC), the 1st Division subsequently fought alongside the combined New Zealand and Australian Division at Gallipoli between April and December 1915, being reinforced by the 2nd Division which was later raised, as well as three light horse brigades. After being evacuated to Egypt the AIF was expanded to five infantry divisions, which were committed to the fighting in France and Belgium along the Western Front in March 1916 as part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). Meanwhile, two mounted divisions remained in the Middle East to fight against Turkish forces in the Sinai and Palestine, serving with the Egyptian Expeditionary Force. In contrast to the static trench warfare that developed in Europe, the troops in the Middle East mostly experienced a more fluid form of warfare involving manoeuvre and combined arms tactics.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1944, the Australian Government {{agreed to}} take on {{responsibility}} for the military operations in the northern Solomon Islands and Australian New Guinea, including New Britain. The Australian Army's 5th Division, under Major General Alan Ramsay, was selected to replace the 40th Infantry Division on New Britain in August, with the unit to assume responsibility for the island on 1 November. Instead of maintaining the American bases in western New Britain the Australians planned to operate closer to the Japanese forces which were positioned around the Gazelle Peninsula in the north-east of the island. By {{the time of the}} Australian take-over, Allied intelligence estimated that the Japanese forces on New Britain amounted to 38,000 personnel, but in actuality there were 93,000 Japanese on the island, forming part of General Hitoshi Imamura's Eighth Area Army. The Japanese personnel were <b>focused</b> <b>upon</b> sustaining themselves, with rice-growing and gardening being undertaken to supplement the limited supplies that were arriving. Japanese supporting elements were limited, with only two aircraft capable of action and no ships other than 150 barges that could move up to 90 personnel or 15 tons of stores.|$|E
