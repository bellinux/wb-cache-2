We also include results from archived air samples in canisters and from polar firn in both hemispheres, thereby deriving an atmospheric record of nearly nine decades (1930 s to present). All three halons were absent from the atmosphere until ∼ 1970, when their atmospheric burdens started to increase rapidly. In recent years H- 1211 and H- 2402 mole fractions have been declining, but H- 1301 has continued to grow. High-frequency observations show continuing emissions of H- 1211 and H- 1301 near most AGAGE sites. For H- 2402 the only emissions detected were derived from the region surrounding the Sea of Japan/East Sea.

Top-down global annual emissions of the halons were derived using a two-dimensional atmospheric model. The emissions of all four have decreased since peaking in the late 1980 s–mid 1990 s but this decline has slowed recently, particularly for H- 1301 and H- 2402 which have shown no decrease in emissions over the past five years.

The observations suggest that the contribution of the halons to total tropospheric bromine at Cape Grim has begun to decline from a peak in 2008 of about 8. 1 ppt. An extrapolation of halon mixing ratios to 2060, based on reported banks and predicted release factors, shows this decline becoming more rapid in the coming decades, with a contribution to total tropospheric bromine of about 3 ppt in 2060. Top-down global annual emissions of the halons were derived using a two-dimensional atmospheric model. The emissions of all four have decreased since peaking in the late 1980 s–mid- 1990 s, but this decline has slowed recently, particularly for H- 1301 and H- 2402 which have shown no decrease in emissions over the past five years.

The implications of an alternative set of steady-state atmospheric lifetimes are discussed. Using a lifetime of 14 yr or less for H- 1211 to calculate top-down emissions estimates would lead to small, or even negative, estimated banks given reported production data. Finally emissions of H- 1202, a product of over-bromination during the production process of H- 1211, have continued despite reported production of H- 1211 ceasing in 2010.

5000|$|Fires are {{classified}} by the proper extinguishing agent. While water {{is used to}} fire Class A fires, using water on a class B fire (such as a grease fire) is extremely dangerous.

Because of this, Class A fire extinguishers use water, while Class B fire extinguishers use dry chemicals (foam or powder), such as aqueous film-forming foam, multi-purpose dry chemicals such as ammonium phosphate, and halogenated agents (such as Halon 1301 and <b>Halon</b> <b>1211).</b> [...] or highly pressurized carbon dioxide.

50|$|For example, Halon 1301 total {{flooding}} {{systems are}} typically used at concentrations {{no higher than}} 7% by volume in air, and can suppress many fires at 2.9% v/v. By contrast, carbon dioxide fire suppression flood systems operate from 34% concentration by volume (surface-only combustion of liquid fuels) up to 75% (dust traps). Carbon dioxide can cause severe distress at concentrations of 3-6%, and has caused death by respiratory paralysis {{in a few minutes}} at 10% concentration. Halon 1301 causes only slight giddiness at its effective concentration of 5%, and even at 15% those exposed remain conscious but impaired and suffer no long-term effects. (Experimental animals have also been exposed to 2% concentrations of Halon 1301 for 30 hours per week for 4 months, with no discernible health effects.) <b>Halon</b> <b>1211</b> also has low toxicity, although it is more toxic than Halon 1301, and thus considered unsuitable for flooding systems.|$|E
50|$|Halon 1301 was {{developed}} in {{a joint venture between}} the U.S. Army and DuPont in 1954, and introduced as an effective gaseous fire suppression fixed systems agent in the 1960s, and was used around valuable materials, such as aircraft, mainframe computers, and telecommunication switching centers, usually in total flooding systems. It was also widely used in the maritime industry to add a third level of protection should the main and emergency fire pumps become inoperable or ineffective. Halon 1301 was never widely used in portables outside military and spacecraft applications, due to its limited range, and invisible discharge. It does not produce the characteristic white cloud like CO2 and is difficult to direct when fighting large fires. Halon 1301 is ideal for armored vehicles and spacecraft, however, because it produces less toxic by-products than does <b>Halon</b> <b>1211,</b> which is critical for combat or space conditions where a compartment {{may not be able to}} be ventilated immediately. Halon 1301 is widely used by the U.S. Military and NASA in a 2-3/4 lb portable extinguisher with a sealed, disposable cylinder for quick recharging. Other agents such as CO2 and E-36 Cryotech wet chemical are largely replacing halon 1301, however, due to environmental concerns. Civilian models in 2-3/4, 3, and 4 lb sizes were also made.|$|E
50|$|Despite their effectiveness, {{chemical}} fire extinguishing agents {{are not without}} disadvantages. In the early 20th century, carbon tetrachloride was extensively used as a dry cleaning solvent, a refrigerant and as a fire extinguishing agent. In time, it was found carbon tetrachloride could lead to severe health effects. From the mid-1960s Halon 1301 was the industry standard for protecting high-value assets {{from the threat of}} fire. Halon 1301 had many benefits as a fire suppression agent; it is fast-acting, safe for assets and required minimal storage space. Halon 1301's major drawbacks are that it depletes atmospheric ozone and is potentially harmful to humans. Since 1987, some 191 nations have signed The Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer. The Protocol is an international treaty designed to protect the ozone layer by phasing out the production of a number of substances believed to be responsible for ozone depletion. Among these were halogenated hydrocarbons often used in fire suppression. As a result, manufacturers have focused on alternatives to Halon 1301 and <b>Halon</b> <b>1211</b> (halogenated hydrocarbons). A number of countries have also taken steps to mandate the removal of installed Halon systems. Most notably these include Germany and Australia, the first two countries in the world to require this action. In both of these countries complete removal of installed Halon systems has been completed except for a very few essential-use applications. The European Union is currently undergoing a similar mandated removal of installed Halon systems.|$|E
