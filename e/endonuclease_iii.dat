In a properly diluted mixture of 5 '- 32 P segments treated with T 4 ligase, the level of phosphatase resistance is very close to the frequency of circle-formation as determined by electron microscopy: thus, the joining of the "flush"-ends involves the formation of circular structures covalently closed in both strands...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackground: <b>Endonuclease</b> <b>III</b> is the {{prototype}} {{for a family}} of DNA-repair enzymes that recognize and remove damaged and mismatched bases from DNA via cleavage of the N-glycosidic bond. Crystal structures for <b>endonuclease</b> <b>III,</b> which removes damaged pyrimidines, and MutY, which removes mismatched adenines, show a highly conserved structure. Although there are several models for DNA binding by this family of enzymes, no experimental structures with bound DNA exist for any member of the family. Results: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy chemical-shift perturbation of backbone nuclei (1 H, 15 N, 13 CO) has been used to map the DNA-binding site on Archaeoglobus fulgidus <b>endonuclease</b> <b>III.</b> The experimentally determined interaction surface includes five structural elements: the helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) motif, the iron–sulfur cluster loop (FCL) motif, the pseudo helix-hairpin-helix motif, the helix B–helix C loop, and helix H. The elements form a continuous surface that spans the active site of the enzyme. Conclusions: The enzyme–DNA interaction surface for <b>endonuclease</b> <b>III</b> contains five elements of the protein structure and suggests that DNA damage recognition may require several specific interactions between the enzyme and the DNA substrate. Because the target DNA used in this study contained a generic apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site, the binding interactions we observed for A. fulgidus <b>endonuclease</b> <b>III</b> should apply to all members of the <b>endonuclease</b> <b>III</b> family and several interactions could apply to the endonuclease III/AlkA (3 -methyladenine DNA glycosylase) superfamily...|$|E
