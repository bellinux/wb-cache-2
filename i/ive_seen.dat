60|$|FANNY. Yes, Mr Trotter: <b>Ive</b> <b>seen</b> a {{good deal}} of life since I came to England; and I assure you that to me youre a mere baby: a dear, good, well-meaning, delightful, witty, charming baby; but still just a wee lamb in a world of wolves. Cambridge is not what it was in my father's time.|$|E
60|$|TROTTER. I cant {{possibly}} {{tell you}} what I shall say to your father about the play until <b>Ive</b> <b>seen</b> the play. But I'll {{tell you what}} I shall say to him about you. I shall say that youre a very foolish young lady; that youve got into a very questionable set; and that the sooner he takes you away from Cambridge and its Fabian Society, the better.|$|E
6000|$|THE BISHOP [musing] I {{wonder who}} will begin the stand against marriage. It must come some day. I was married myself before I'd thought about it; {{and even if}} I had thought about it I was too much in love with Alice to let {{anything}} stand in the way. But, you know, <b>Ive</b> <b>seen</b> one of our daughters after another--Ethel, Jane, Fanny, and Christina and Florence--go out at that door in their veils and orange blossoms; and Ive always wondered whether theyd have gone quietly if theyd known what they were doing. Ive a horrible misgiving about that pamphlet. All progress means war with Society. Heaven forbid that Edith {{should be one of}} the combatants! ...|$|E

60|$|THE GENERAL [very gravely] I {{remember}} the case now. I {{had forgotten the}} name. I'll not refuse your acquaintance, Mr Hotchkiss; partly because youre my brother's guest, and partly because <b>Ive</b> <b>seen</b> too much active service not to know that every man's nerve plays him false {{at one time or}} another, and that some very honorable men should never go into action at all, because theyre not built that way. But if I were you I should not use that visiting card. No doubt it's an honorable trait in your character that you dont wish any man to give you his hand in ignorance of your disgrace; but you had better allow us to forget. We wish to forget. It isnt your disgrace alone: it's a disgrace to the army and to all of us. Pardon my plain speaking.|$|E
60|$|GUNNER. [reassuring her gravely] Dont you be alarmed, maam. I {{know what}} is due {{to you as a}} lady and to myself as a gentleman. I regard you with respect and affection. If you had been my mother, as you ought to have been, I should have had more chance. But you shall have no cause to be ashamed of me. The {{strength}} of a chain is no greater than its weakest link; but the greatness of a poet is the greatness of his greatest moment. Shakespear used to get drunk. Frederick the Great ran away from a battle. But it was what they could rise to, not what they could sink to, that made them great. They werent good always; but they were good on their day. Well, on my day--on my day, mind you--I'm good for something too. I know that Ive made a silly exhibition of myself here. I know I didnt rise to the occasion. I know that if youd been my mother, youd have been ashamed of me. I lost my presence of mind: I was a contemptible coward. But [slapping himself on the chest] I'm not the man I was then. This is my day. <b>Ive</b> <b>seen</b> the tenth possessor of a foolish face carried out kicking and screaming by a woman. [To Percival] You crowed pretty big over me. You hypnotized me. But when you were put through the fire yourself, you were found wanting. I tell you straight I dont give a damn for you.|$|E
