40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} method of adaptively {{generating}} a <b>gait</b> pattern of biped robot. The <b>gait</b> synthesis is based on human’s <b>gait</b> pattern analysis.

To analyze the human’s <b>gait</b> pattern, sequential images of the human’s <b>gait</b> on the sagittal plane are acquired from which the <b>gait</b> control values are extracted. The <b>gait</b> pattern of biped robot on the sagittal plane is adaptively generated by a genetic algorithm using the human’s <b>gait</b> control values. However, <b>gait</b> trajectories of the biped robot on the sagittal plane are not enough to construct the complete <b>gait</b> pattern because the biped robot moves on 3 -dimension space.

40|$|The present paper {{describes}} the hydrodynamic forces acting on different sized fish-shaped objects in a von Kármán vortex street, where in a wake {{of an object}} a specific locomotion pattern, Kármán <b>gaiting,</b> is observed. The present paper investigates the hydrodynamic forces, both lateral force and torque on a passive fish-shaped body in those hydrodynamic conditions. By using a range of fish length to wake wavelengths, size matters were experimentally tested for balancing the forces on an artificial fish intercepting oncoming vortices, potentially to exploit the lateral and rotational elements in the flow that may facilitate Kármán <b>gaiting</b> in a biological fish. To do this, five artificial fish were manufactured to mimic a rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), were inserted into the flow tunnel and recorded simultaneously the hydrodynamic forces and DPIV images.

40|$|Fishes often live in environments {{characterized}} by complex flows. To study {{the mechanisms of}} how fishes interact with unsteady flows, the periodic shedding of vortices behind cylinders has been employed to great effect. In particular, fishes that hold station in a vortex street (i. e., K?rm?n <b>gaiting)</b> show swimming kinematics that are distinct from their patterns of motion during freestream swimming in uniform flows, although both behaviors can be modeled as an undulatory body wave. K?rm?n gait kinematics are largely preserved across flow velocities. Larger fish have a shorter body wavelength and slower body wave speed than smaller fish, in contrast to freestream swimming where body wavelength and wave speed increases with size. The opportunity for K?rm?n <b>gaiting</b> only occurs under specific conditions of flow velocity and depends {{on the length of}} the fish; this is reflected in the highest probability of K?rm?n <b>gaiting</b> at intermediate flow velocities. Fish typically K?rm?n gait in a region of the cylinder wake where the velocity deficit is about 40 % of the nominal flow. The lateral line plays a role in tuning the kinematics of the K?rm?n gait, since blocking it leads to aberrant kinematics. Vision allows fish to maintain a consistent position relative to the cylinder. In the dark, fish do not show the same preference to hold station behind a cylinder though K?rm?n gait kinematics are the same. When oxygen consumption level is measured, it reveals that K?rm?n <b>gaiting</b> represents about half of the cost of swimming in the freestreamauthorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|E

We evaluated relative contributions of specific elements of cognitive function (including sustained attention and processing speed) to dual task <b>gait</b> speed in a nationally representative population of community-dwelling adults over 50 years. METHODS: <b>Gait</b> speed was obtained using the GaitRite walkway during three <b>gait</b> tasks: single, cognitive (alternate letters), and motor (carrying a filled glass). Linear regression models, adjusted for covariates, were constructed to predict the relative contributions of seven neuropsychological tests to <b>gait</b> speed differences and to investigate <b>gait</b> task effects. RESULTS: The mean age and <b>gait</b> speed of the population (n = 4, 431, 55 % women) was 62. 4 years (SD = 8. 2) and 135. 85 cm/s (SD = 20. 20, single task), respectively.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Human <b>gait</b> identification has become an active area of research due to increased security requirements. Human <b>gait</b> identification is a potential new tool for identifying individuals beyond traditional methods. The emergence of motion capture techniques provided a chance of high accuracy in identification because completely recorded <b>gait</b> information can be recorded compared with security cameras. The aim {{of this research was}} to build a practical method of <b>gait</b> identification and investigate the individual characteristics of <b>gait.</b> For this purpose, a <b>gait</b> identification approach was proposed, identification results were compared by different methods, and several studies about the individual characteristics of <b>gait</b> were performed. This research included the following: (1) a novel, effective set of <b>gait</b> features were proposed; (2) <b>gait</b> signatures were extracted by three different methods: statistical method, principal component analysis, and Fourier expansion method; (3) <b>gait</b> identification results were compared by these different methods; (4) two indicators were proposed to evaluate <b>gait</b> features for identification; (5) novel and clear definitions of <b>gait</b> phases and <b>gait</b> cycle were proposed; (6) <b>gait</b> features were investigated by <b>gait</b> phases; (7) principal component analysis and the fixing root method were used to elucidate which features were used to represent <b>gait</b> and why; (8) <b>gait</b> similarity was investigated; (9) <b>gait</b> attractiveness was investigated. This research proposed an efficient framework for identifying individuals from <b>gait</b> via a novel feature set based on 3 D motion capture data. A novel evaluating method of <b>gait</b> signatures for identification was proposed. Three different <b>gait</b> signature extraction methods were applied and compared. The average identification rate was over 93 %, with the best result close to 100 %.

Based on grasp wrench space, this thesis address the problems of measuring the grasp sensitivity against friction changes, planning contacts and hand configurations on mesh and point cloud representations of arbitrary objects, planning adaptable grasps and finger <b>gaiting</b> for keeping a grasp stable under various external disturbances, as well as learning of grasping manifolds for more accurate reachability and inverse kinematics computation for multifingered grasping.   Firstly, we propose a new concept called friction sensitivity, which measures how susceptible a specific grasp is {{to changes in the}} underlying frictionc oefficients. We develop algorithms for the synthesis of stable grasps with low friction sensitivity and for the synthesis of stable grasps in the case of small friction coefficients.    Secondly, for fast planning of contacts and hand configurations for dexterous grasping, as well as keeping the stability of a grasp during execution, we present a unified framework for grasp planning and in-hand grasp adaptation using visual, tactile and proprioceptive feedback. The main objective of the proposed framework is to enable fingertip grasping by addressing problems of changed weight of the object, slippage and external disturbances.
