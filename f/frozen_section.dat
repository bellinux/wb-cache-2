2500|$|Histopathology {{refers to}} the {{microscopic}} examination of various forms of human tissue. [...] Specifically, in clinical medicine, histopathology {{refers to the}} examination of a biopsy or surgical specimen by a pathologist, after the specimen has been processed and histological sections have been placed onto glass slides. [...] This contrasts with the methods of cytopathology, which uses free cells or tissue fragments. [...] Histopathological examination of tissues starts with surgery, biopsy, or autopsy. [...] The tissue {{is removed from the}} body of an organism and then placed in a fixative that stabilizes the tissues to prevent decay. The most common fixative is formalin, although <b>frozen</b> <b>section</b> fixing is also common. [...] To see the tissue under a microscope, the sections are stained with one or more pigments. The aim of staining is to reveal cellular components; counterstains are used to provide contrast. [...] Histochemistry refers to the science of using chemical reactions between laboratory chemicals and components within tissue. [...] The histological slides are then interpreted diagnostically and the resulting pathology report describes the histological findings and the opinion of the pathologist. [...] In the case of cancer, this represents the tissue diagnosis required for most treatment protocols.|$|E

50|$|Fixed or unfixed tissue may {{be frozen}} and sliced using a {{microtome}} mounted in a refrigeration device {{known as a}} cryostat. The <b>frozen</b> <b>sections</b> are mounted on a glass slide and may be stained to enhance the contrast between different tissues. Unfixed <b>frozen</b> <b>sections</b> {{can also be used}} for studies requiring enzyme localization in tissues and cells.

5000|$|When in doubt, {{a patient}} should demand that either Mohs surgery or <b>frozen</b> <b>section</b> {{histology}} with either margin control (ccpdma) or thin serial bread-loafing is utilized {{when dealing with}} a tumour on the face. The pathologist processing the <b>frozen</b> <b>section</b> specimen should cut multiple sections through the block to minimize the false negative error rate. Or one should simply process the tissue utilizing a method approximating the Mohs method (described in most basic histopathology text books or described in this reference [...] ) during <b>frozen</b> <b>section</b> processing. Unfortunately, these methods are difficult when applied to frozen sections; {{and they are very}} tedious to process. When not utilizing <b>frozen</b> <b>section,</b> the surgeon might have to wait a week or more before informing the patient if more tumour is left, or if the surgical margin is too narrow. A second surgery must be performed to remove the residual or potential residual tumour once the surgeon informs the patient of the positive or narrow surgical margin on the surgical pathology report.|$|E

40|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century anatomists claimed a new technique—slicing frozen corpses into sections—translated the {{three-dimensional}} complexity of the human body into flat, visually striking, and unprecedentedly accurate images. Traditionally hostile to visual aids, elite anatomists controversially claimed <b>frozen</b> <b>sections</b> had replaced dissection as the “true anatomy. ” Some obstetricians adopted <b>frozen</b> <b>sectioning</b> to challenge anatomists’ authority and reform how clinicians made and used pictures. To explain the successes and failures of the technique, this article reconstructs the debates through which practitioners learned to make and interpret, to promote or denigrate <b>frozen</b> <b>sections</b> in teaching and research. Focusing on Britain, the author shows that attempts to introduce <b>frozen</b> <b>sectioning</b> into anatomy and obstetrics shaped and were shaped by negotiations over the epistemological standing of hand and eye in medicineThis work was supported by the Wellcome Trust through enhancement and strategic awards in the history of medicine on the theme “Generation to Reproduction” (074298, 088708).

5000|$|The <b>frozen</b> <b>section</b> {{procedure}} {{as practiced}} today in medical laboratories {{is based on}} the description by Dr Louis B. Wilson in 1905.

Cullen at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore also involved <b>frozen</b> <b>section,</b> but only after formalin fixation, and pathologist Dr William Welch, also at Hopkins, experimented with Cullen's procedure but without clinical consequences. Hence, Wilson is generally credited with truly pioneering the procedure (Gal & Cagle, 2005).|$|E

40|$|Background: in {{advanced}} {{head and neck}} tumors margins are very rarely comprehensively checked by <b>frozen</b> <b>sections.</b> {{the goal of this}} study was to analyze a new proposal for harvesting margins using a double- bladed scalpel. Methods: Thirty-eight patients underwent a comprehensive resection of advanced head and neck tumors with a double- bladed scalpel. Margins were mapped and checked by <b>frozen</b> <b>sections,</b> while tumor resection continued. When positive margins were identified, they were excised again, and checked by <b>frozen</b> <b>sections.</b> Results: Thirty-three patients (87 %) had clear skin and soft tissue margins at <b>frozen</b> <b>sections.</b> Five patients (13 %) had focal skin and soft tissue-positive margins at <b>frozen</b> <b>sections,</b> which were re-excised. Two patients (5 %) had skin and soft tissue-positive margins only at permanent sections. One was reoperated and 1 received radiation therapy. the 3 -year local control rate was 58 %. Conclusions: in this preliminary study, the double- bladed scalpel appeared to be an interesting option for complete intraoperative evaluation of surgical margins of advanced head and neck tumors.
