5|$|In 2005, Rasmussen {{was part}} of a large multi-institutional {{collaboration}} investigating biodiversity <b>hotspots,</b> which have a prominent role in conservation. The study assessed locations quantitatively for three criteria of bird diversity – species richness, the level of threat, and the number of endemism species. The results demonstrated that <b>hotspots</b> did not show the same geographical distribution for each factor. Only 2.5% of hotspot areas are common to all three aspects of diversity, with over 80% of <b>hotspots</b> registering on only one criterion. Each criterion explained less than 24% of the variation in the other factors, suggesting that even within a single taxonomic class, different mechanisms are responsible for the origin and maintenance of various aspects of diversity. Consequently, the different types of <b>hotspots</b> also vary greatly in their utility as conservation tools.|$|E

50|$|Porting <b>HotSpot</b> is {{difficult}} as the code, while mostly written in C++, contains much assembly language. To remedy this, the IcedTea project {{has developed a}} generic port of the <b>HotSpot</b> interpreter called zero-assembler <b>Hotspot</b> (or zero), with almost no assembly code. This port is intended for easy adaptation of the interpreter component of <b>HotSpot</b> to any Linux processor architecture. The code of zero-assembler <b>Hotspot</b> is used for all the non-x86 architecture ports of <b>HotSpot</b> (PowerPC, Itanium (IA-64), S390 and ARM) since version 1.6.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Hotspot</b> is {{the part}} of a program where most {{execution}} time is spent. Detecting the <b>hotspot</b> enables the optimization of the program. The performance event counters embedded in modern processors provide the hardware support for the <b>hotspot</b> detection. By sampling the instruction addresses of the running program with performance event counters, <b>hotspot</b> of the program can be statistically detected. This technical report describes our tool to find the sections of the code that are detected as the <b>hotspot</b> of the program with performance event counters. SPEC CPU 2006 benchmarks are tested with our tool and the results show the <b>hotspot</b> sections and overhead of the <b>hotspot</b> detection tool...|$|R

5|$|Upon death, whale {{carcasses}} fall to {{the deep}} ocean and provide a substantial habitat for marine life. Evidence of whale falls in present-day and fossil records shows that deep sea whale falls support a rich assemblage of creatures, with a global diversity of 407 species, comparable to other neritic biodiversity <b>hotspots,</b> such as cold seeps and hydrothermal vents.|$|E
5|$|Level Mountain has {{experienced}} volcanic eruptions sporadically {{for the last}} 15 million years, making it the most persistent volcano of the NCVP. More than 20 eruptive centres are present on the summit and flanks of the massif. These have produced mainly felsic and mafic lavas, a chemical composition range typical of bimodal volcanism. Such volcanism commonly occurs at <b>hotspots,</b> continental rifts and leaky transform faults. The existence of olivine, orthopyroxene and spinel xenocrysts in Level Mountain basalt suggest that volcanism at the massif originated from the upper mantle. Hiatuses of up to a million years or more can be expected between periods of volcanic activity at Level Mountain.|$|E

5|$|Like all Hawaiian volcanoes, Kīlauea {{was created}} as the Pacific tectonic plate moved over the Hawaiian hotspot in the Earth's {{underlying}} mantle. The Hawaii island volcanoes {{are the most}} recent evidence of this process that, over 70 million years, has created the -long Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain. The prevailing, though not completely settled, {{view is that the}} hotspot has been largely stationary within the planet's mantle for much, if not all of the Cenozoic Era. However, while the Hawaiian mantle plume is well understood and extensively studied, the nature of <b>hotspots</b> themselves remains fairly enigmatic.|$|E
5|$|Protests {{continued}} in Alexandria and Mansoura, where Al Jazeera suggested up {{to a million}} people marched. In Cairo, Egyptian army tanks cleared a highway overpass from which pro-Mubarak protesters had been hurling rocks and Molotov cocktails onto the anti-Mubarak protesters. On the streets below, hundreds of armed soldiers lined up between the two factions, pushing the pro-Mubarak protesters back and blocking the main <b>hotspots</b> {{in front of the}} Egyptian Museum and at other entrances to the square. Violence was reported to have been perpetrated by police.|$|E
5|$|Seamounts are {{exceptionally}} {{important to}} their biome ecologically, but their role in their environment is poorly understood. Because they project out above the surrounding sea floor, they disturb standard water flow, causing eddies and associated hydrological phenomena that ultimately result in water movement in an otherwise still ocean bottom. Currents have been measured at up to 0.9knots, or 48centimeters per second. Because of this upwelling seamounts often carry above-average plankton populations, seamounts are thus centers where the fish that feed on them aggregate, in turn falling prey to further predation, making seamounts important biological <b>hotspots.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Hotspot</b> is {{a special}} kind of {{clustered}} pattern. Like general clustered patterns, objects in the <b>hotspot</b> regions have high similarity in comparison to one another, and are quite dissimilar to all the objects outside the <b>hotspot.</b> One important feature that distinguish <b>hotspot</b> from general cluster is that the objects in the <b>hotspot</b> area are more active compared to all the others (density, appearance, etc). <b>Hotspot</b> discovery/detection in spatial data mining is a process of finding certain spatial regions where more events are likely to happen, or more objects are likely to appear, in comparison to the other areas...|$|R

5|$|The East Riding is characterised {{by a high}} {{employment}} rate and a relatively low unemployment level. The overall un{{employment rate}} is 4.3%, which is 1.2 percentage points lower than the national average. However, there are unemployment <b>hotspots</b> in Bridlington, Goole and Withernsea. Unemployment levels tend to fluctuate {{over the course of}} the year with lower levels during the summer months due to increased employment in the tourism and food production sectors. A major year-round employer in the East Riding is the Defence School of Transport at RAF Leconfield, which trains 14,000 personnel from the Army, the Royal Air Force and the Royal Marines each year and provides more than 1,000 civilian jobs.|$|E
5|$|The Hawaii hotspot is a {{volcanic}} hotspot {{located near the}} namesake Hawaiian Islands, in the northern Pacific Ocean. One of the most well-known and heavily studied <b>hotspots</b> in the world, the Hawaii plume {{is responsible for the}} creation of the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain, a chain of volcanoes over 5,800 kilometres (3,600mi) long. Four of these volcanoes are active, two are dormant, and more than 123 are extinct, many having since been ground beneath the waves by erosion as seamounts and atolls. The chain extends from south of the island of Hawaii {{to the edge of the}} Aleutian Trench, near the eastern edge of Russia. While most volcanoes are created by geological activity at tectonic plate boundaries, the Hawaii hotspot is located far from plate boundaries. The classic hotspot theory, first proposed in 1963 by John Tuzo Wilson, proposes that a single, fixed mantle plume builds volcanoes that then, cut off from their source by the movement of the Pacific Plate, become increasingly inactive and eventually erode below sea level over millions of years. According to this theory, the nearly 60° bend where the Emperor and Hawaiian segments of the chain meet was caused by a sudden shift in the movement of the Pacific Plate. In 2003, fresh investigations of this irregularity led to the proposal of a mobile hotspot theory, suggesting that <b>hotspots</b> are mobile, not fixed, and that the 47-million-year-old bend was caused by a shift in the hotspot's motion rather than the plate's.|$|E

50|$|The Great Meteor <b>hotspot</b> track, also {{referred}} to as the New England <b>hotspot</b> track, is a vast trail of <b>hotspot</b> magmatism in the Northern Hemisphere. It extends over 5800 km from Nunavut in Northern Canada to the northern Atlantic Ocean. Volcanism in the <b>hotspot</b> track was produced by the New England or Great Meteor <b>hotspot,</b> with the oldest magmatic activity dating back at least 214 million years ago during the Late Triassic period. This makes the Great Meteor track one of the oldest <b>hotspot</b> tracks on Earth.

5|$|The {{source of}} the long {{secondary}} periods is unknown, but they certainly aren't due to radial pulsations.

One theory to explain long secondary periods is that they are caused by the evolution of such cells combined with the rotation of the star. Other theories include close binary interactions, chromospheric magnetic activity influencing mass loss, or non-radial pulsations such as g-modes.|$|E

5|$|Vampire bats use {{infrared}} radiation to locate blood <b>hotspots</b> on their prey. A recent study {{has shown that}} common vampire bats tune a TRP-channel that is already heat-sensitive, TRPV1, by lowering its thermal activation threshold to about 30°C. This is achieved through alternative splicing of TRPV1 transcripts to produce a channel with a truncated carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic domain. These splicing events occur exclusively in trigeminal ganglia, and not in dorsal root ganglia, thereby maintaining a role for TRPV1 as a detector of noxious heat in somatic afferents. The only other vertebrates capable of detecting {{infrared radiation}} are boas, pythons and pit vipers, {{all of which have}} pit organs.|$|E

5|$|Beneath a Steel Sky is a 2D {{adventure}} {{game played}} from a third-person perspective. The player uses a point-and-click interface {{to interact with}} the environment and to guide protagonist Robert Foster through the game's world. To solve puzzles and progress in the game, the player collects items that may be combined with one another, used on the environment, or given to non-player characters (NPCs). The protagonist converses with NPCs via dialogue trees to learn about the game's puzzles and plot. Clues and other information are obtained by clicking on items in the inventory and on objects in the environment. Unlike in most adventure games at the time, the protagonist's death is possible, after which the player starts from the last save point. In the remastered iOS version, the point-and-click interface is replaced with a touch user interface, a hint system is added, and <b>hotspots</b> are highlighted.|$|E
