60|$|Siegmund, rebuffed by {{the only}} one in the house from whom he might have {{expected}} friendship, proceeded slowly to shave, feeling sick at heart. He was a long time over his toilet. When he stripped himself for the bath, it seemed to him <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> sea. He bent his head and licked his shoulder. It tasted decidedly salt.|$|E
60|$|When Kit {{was half}} {{way across the}} alameda he stopped and looked about. Dark trees rose against the sky; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> {{eucalyptus}} and their thin shadows covered {{the ground with a}} quivering, open pattern. There was a pool of moonlight, and farther on the solid, fan-shaped reflections of palms. Nobody was near him, although he heard voices across the alameda, and he stood for a few moments, thinking, while his heart beat.|$|E
60|$|Then, silently, on {{infinitely}} careful feet, he {{went along}} the passage, feeling {{the wall with}} the extreme tips of his fingers. There was a door. He stood and listened. He could hear two people's breathing. It was not that. He went stealthily forward. There was another door, slightly open. The room was in darkness. Empty. Then there was the bathroom, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> soap and the heat. Then at the end another bedroom--one soft breathing. This was she.|$|E
6000|$|... "Remember when 'e {{told us to}} walk {{in single}} file for fear o' bears? 'Remember, Pye, when 'e 'opped about in that bog full o' ferns an' sniffed an' said <b>'e</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> smoke of 'is uncle's farm? An' all {{the time it was}} a dirty little out-lyin' {{uninhabited}} island. We walked round it in a day, an' come back to our boat lyin' on the beach. A whole day Boy Niven kept us walkin' in circles lookin' for 'is uncle's farm! He said his uncle was compelled by {{the law of the land}} to give us a farm!" ...|$|R
60|$|But {{it was all}} dark to Dick. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> only <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> camels, the hay-bales, the cooking, {{the smoky}} fires, and the tanned canvas of the tents as he stood, where he had dropped from the train, {{shouting}} for George. There was a sound of light- hearted kicking on the iron skin of the rear trucks, with squealing and grunting. George was unloading the mules.|$|R
60|$|Old Admiral Sanchez was wont to {{maintain}} that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> thirty, and <b>the</b> men of the first ship in which I sailed claimed that Coburn, the navigating officer, knew by name every wave along thirty from 60dN. to 60dS. However, I'd hate to vouch for this.|$|R
60|$|On {{entering}} the building, George stopped to feel for a lantern which was kept {{on a shelf}} near the door. The place was very dark and pleasantly warm by contrast with the bitter frost outside, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> peppermint in the prairie hay. Familiar sounds reached him--the soft rattle of a shaking rope, the crackle of crushed straw--but they were rather more numerous than usual, and while he listened {{one or two of}} the horses began to move restlessly.|$|E
60|$|He {{clutched}} the chain {{by which the}} cone hung, and the thing sank an infinitesimal amount as he struck it. A circle of glowing red appeared about him, and a tongue of flame, released from the chaos within, flickered up towards him. An intense pain assailed him at the knees, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> singeing of his hands. He raised himself to his feet, and tried to climb up the chain, and then something struck his head. Black and shining with the moonlight, the throat of the furnace rose about him.|$|E
60|$|He slowly {{ventured into}} the pond. The bottom was deep, soft clay, he sank in, and the water clasped dead cold round his legs. As he stirred <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> cold, rotten clay that fouled up into the water. It was {{objectionable}} in his lungs. Still, repelled and yet not heeding, he moved deeper into the pond. The cold water rose over his thighs, over his loins, upon his abdomen. The lower {{part of his body}} was all sunk in the hideous cold element. And the bottom was so deeply soft and uncertain, he was afraid of pitching with his mouth underneath. He could not swim, and was afraid.|$|E
6000|$|It {{must not}} be supposed, then, that our friend John Bax--{{sometimes}} called [...] "captain," [...] sometimes [...] "skipper," [...] not unfrequently [...] "mister," [...] but most commonly [...] "Bax," [...] without any modification--was a hopeless castaway, because he was found by his friend Guy Foster {{in a room full}} of careless foul-mouthed seamen, eating his bread and cheese and drinking his beer in an atmosphere so impregnated with tobacco smoke that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> scarcely see, and so redolent of gin that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> scarcely <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> smoke! ...|$|R
5000|$|After the {{discovery}} of gold at Sutter's Fort, Swift took a party to Bidwell's Bar in 1848 and struck it rich. A fellow miner recalls, [...] "Swift {{was one of the}} best miners I ever knew. It seems as if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> almost <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> gold. <b>He</b> made an immense amount of gold." [...] With his newfound wealth, Swift, his brother William, and his cousin Frank Sears first purchased the ranch they had been working, and later purchased 15,000 acres (61 kmÂ²) of Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo's Rancho Petaluma, located near Sears Point.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, we won't quarrel {{about the}} number. The {{question}} is, Why not work {{him in the}} field of foreign literature? You can't go over all their reviews and magazines, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do <b>the</b> <b>smelling</b> for you, if you could trust his nose. Would he know a good thing?" ...|$|R
60|$|A {{bunch of}} flowers stood upon the table; and their scent {{mingled with the}} faint smell of decay that hung about the room. Lying still, Dick heard the leather curtain rustle softly in the draught, muffled sounds of traffic, and the drowsy murmur of the surf. Its rhythmic beat was {{soothing}} and he thought <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> sea. By and by he made an abrupt move that hurt him as a voice floated into the room. It was singularly clear and sweet, {{and he thought he}} knew it, as he seemed to know the song, but could not catch the words and the singing stopped. Then light footsteps passed the arch and there was silence again.|$|E
60|$|Dick {{ran down}} the drive and {{a few moments later}} his {{motorcycle}} was humming up the road. He sped through a dark firwood, where the cool air was filled with resinous scent, and out across a hillside down which the stocked sheaves stood in silvery rows, but he noticed nothing except that the white strip of road was clear in front. His thoughts were back in the garden with Clare Kenwardine, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> clogging sweetness of the stocks. This was folly, and he changed the gear on moderate hills and altered the control when the engine did not need it, to occupy his mind; but the picture of the girl he carried away with him would not be banished.|$|E
6000|$|... "And wasn't it me {{that said}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> divils," [...] said Terence, as he circled around us in a mimic war dance. And when from the fort they saw us {{coming across the}} fields they opened the gates in astonishment, and on hearing the news gave {{themselves}} over to the wildest rejoicing. For the backwoodsmen were children of nature. Bill Cowan ran for the fiddle which he had carried so carefully over the mountain, and that night we had jigs and reels on the common while the big fellow played [...] "Billy of the Wild Woods" [...] and [...] "Jump Juba," [...] with all his might, and the pine knots threw their fitful, red light on the wild scenes of merriment. I must have cut a queer little figure as I sat between Cowan and Tom watching the dance, for presently Colonel Clark came up to us, laughing in his quiet way.|$|E
5000|$|The fuzzy navel {{was one of}} {{the first}} drinks to arise in the new {{popularity}} of cocktails and mixed drinks in the 1980s. The drink was invented over 30 years ago by Ray Foley, a well known bartender and founder of Bartender Magazine. [...] The story goes that Ray was cutting an orange for a garnish when a man nearby made the remark that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> still <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> fuzz of the peach schnapps through the orange juice. Ray looked at the orange and saw the printed word [...] "Navel" [...] for navel orange. Thus the cocktail was born.|$|R
60|$|Smith {{found himself}} very wide awake indeed. Never {{in all his}} life did he {{remember}} being more so, {{not even in the}} hour of its great catastrophe, or when his godfather, Ebenezer, after much hesitation, had promised him a clerkship in the bank of which he was a director. His nerves seemed strung tight as harp-strings, and his every sense was painfully acute. Thus <b>he</b> <b>could</b> even <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> odour of mummies that floated down from the upper galleries and the earthy scent of the boat which had been buried for thousands of years in sand {{at the foot of the}} pyramid of one of the fifth dynasty kings.|$|R
60|$|To his surprise, {{however, the}} young girl, {{following}} {{the path to}} the lilacs, began leisurely to ascend the hill, swaying from side to side with a youthful movement, and swinging the long stalk of a lily at her side. In another moment he would be discovered! Dick was frightened; his confidence of the moment before had all gone; he would fly,--and yet, an exquisite and fearful joy kept him motionless. She was approaching him, full and clear in the moonlight. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> see the grace of her delicate figure in the simple white frock drawn at the waist with broad satin ribbon, and its love-knots of pale blue ribbons on her shoulders; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> see the coils of her brown hair, the pale, olive tint of her oval cheek, the delicate, swelling nostril of her straight, clear-cut nose; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> even <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> lily she carried in her little hand. Then, suddenly, she lifted her long lashes, and her large gray eyes met his.|$|R
60|$|The next day's {{work was}} much the same, {{only that they}} crossed no rivers. It rained harder, however, and when evening came Carroll, who had burst one boot, was limping badly. They made camp among the {{dripping}} firs which partly sheltered them from the bitter wind, and shortly after their meager supper Carroll fell asleep. Vane, to his annoyance, found {{that he could not}} follow his friend's example. He was overstrung, and the knowledge that the morrow would show whether the spruce he sought grew in that valley made him restless. The flap of the tent was flung back and resting on one elbow he looked out upon shadowy ranks of trunks, which rose out of the gloom and vanished again as the firelight grew and sank. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> acrid smoke and could hear the splash of heavy drops upon the saturated soil, while the hoarse roar of the river came up in fitful cadence from the depths of the valley.|$|E
60|$|There were dim black {{trees and}} shadowy rocks close {{in front of}} him, with a white wash about the latter, for a smooth swell worked in around a point from open water. He could hear the rumble of the surf upon the reefs, and though he could {{scarcely}} feel a breath of wind upon his face the wailing of the black pines suggested that it was blowing still. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> clean resinous scent of them {{and it seemed to}} him that they were singing wild, barbaric songs. Afterward, when he knew them better, he learned that the pines and their kin, the cedars and balsams and redwoods, are never silent altogether. Even when their fragrance steals out heavy and sweet as honey under the fierce sunshine of a windless day, one can hear faint elfin whisperings high up among their somber spires. Then he saw that Jake was standing on the side deck, apparently gazing at the white surf about the end of the point.|$|E
60|$|I do {{not mean}} {{that there was no}} law for the boys, for it was {{manifest}} to their terror in two officers whom they knew as constables, and who may have reigned one after another, or together, with full power of life and death over them, as they felt; but who in a community mainly so peaceful acted upon Dogberry's advice, and made and meddled with rogues as little as they could. From time to time it was known among the boys that you would be taken up if you went in swimming inside of the corporation line, and for a while they would be careful to keep beyond it; but this could not last; they were soon back in the old places, and I suppose no arrests were ever really made. They did, indeed, hear once that Old Griffin, as they called him, caught a certain boy in the river before dark, and carried him up through the town to his own home naked. Of course no such thing ever happened; but the boys believed it, and it froze my boy's soul with fear; all the more because this constable was a cabinet-maker and made coffins; from his father's printing-office the boy could hear the long slide of his plane over the wood, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> varnish on the boards.|$|E
5000|$|Soapy Jennings (Dave Wittenberg) - A safe cracker and {{a friend}} of Colton. Soapy's two {{specialties}} are cracking safes and cheating at poker, two major moral strikes against him in the Old West. During the ride to Piper Lake from the Badlands, he confides to Cole the origin of his nickname: he was cornered in a lady friend's bedroom by her husband, and was forced to hide inside the shaft of her water closet - after which he had to scrub for three days before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> get <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> off of him.|$|R
5000|$|Being {{a magical}} dog, Jake has an acute sense of smell, {{as he can}} {{apparently}} <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> precise location of an object miles away. In [...] "The Chamber of Frozen Blades" [...] he stated that his sense of smell is [...] "1,000 times better" [...] than Finn's, although compared to normal dogs this is a low estimate, suggesting that he was either just guessing, or his sense of smell {{is similar to that}} of an average dog. He also claimed in [...] "The Enchiridion" [...] that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not only <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> book, but also that it was in a room inside of a castle.|$|R
6000|$|This {{particular}} {{afternoon was}} {{a step in the}} right direction, because it was part of his plan to get to know people beyond the family circuit, just as it was part of his plan to learn German this autumn, and to review legal books for Mr. Hilbery's [...] "Critical Review." [...] He had always made plans since he was a small boy; for poverty, and the fact that he was the eldest son of a large family, had given him the habit of thinking of spring and summer, autumn and winter, as so many stages in a prolonged campaign. Although he was still under thirty, this forecasting habit had marked two semicircular lines above his eyebrows, which threatened, at this moment, to crease into their wonted shapes. But instead of settling down to think, he rose, took a small piece of cardboard marked in large letters with the word OUT, and hung it upon the handle of his door. This done, he sharpened a pencil, lit a reading-lamp and opened his book. But still he hesitated to take his seat. He scratched the rook, he walked to the window; he parted the curtains, and looked down upon the city which lay, hazily luminous, beneath him. He looked across the vapors in the direction of Chelsea; looked fixedly for a moment, and then returned to his chair. But the whole thickness of some learned counsel's treatise upon Torts did not screen him satisfactorily. Through the pages he saw a drawing-room, very empty and spacious; he heard low voices, he saw women's figures, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> even <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> scent of the cedar log which flamed in the grate. His mind relaxed its tension, and seemed to be giving out now what it had taken in unconsciously at the time. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> remember Mr. Fortescue's exact words, and the rolling emphasis with which he delivered them, and he began to repeat what Mr. Fortescue had said, in Mr. Fortescue's own manner, about Manchester. His mind then began to wander about the house, and he wondered whether there were other rooms like the drawing-room, and he thought, inconsequently, how beautiful the bathroom must be, and how leisurely it was--the life of these well-kept people, who were, no doubt, still sitting in the same room, only they had changed their clothes, and little Mr. Anning was there, and the aunt who would mind if the glass of her father's picture was broken. Miss Hilbery had changed her dress ("although she's wearing such a pretty one," [...] he heard her mother say), and she was talking to Mr. Anning, who was well over forty, and bald into the bargain, about books. How peaceful and spacious it was; and the peace possessed him so completely that his muscles slackened, his book drooped from his hand, and he forgot that the hour of work was wasting minute by minute.|$|R
60|$|Alton {{had reached}} the limit of his surmises, and {{refilling}} his pipe again abandoned himself to more pleasant dreams. He heard the whistle of the locomotive ringing among the pines, and {{the hum of the}} great mills that would grind out wealth for Somasco. Then while the pungent smoke curled about him visions materialized out of its filmy wreaths, and he saw the lake at Carnaby shining amidst the woodlands of peaceful England, and the old grey hall. In place of the sting of the resin <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> English roses, and when the next acrid wisp slid past him it seemed to change its form, and there grew out of it the gracious, alluring shape of a woman. Costly fabrics floated about her, there was a flash of diamonds in the red-gold hair, a face that lost its patrician serenity as it smiled, and for a setting the glitter of light and silver in the great hall at Carnaby. Alton, whose eyes were growing dim, stretched out his arms towards the darkness, and a chilling gust swept the smoke aside, while great drops of water fell splashing upon him. He was back once more in the wilderness, a wet and very weary man, with thorn-rents in his deerskin jacket and the mire clinging about him, but he smiled as he rose stiffly and stretched his aching limbs.|$|E
6000|$|That {{evening after}} dinner {{he went to}} his study and took a sheet of paper. He stayed for some minutes without writing, then rose and stood under the {{masterpiece}} 'Dutch Fishing Boats at Sunset.' He was not thinking of that picture, but of his life. He was going to leave her something in his Will; nothing could so have stirred the stilly deeps of thought and memory. He was going to leave her a portion of his wealth, of his aspirations, deeds, qualities, work--all that had made that wealth; going to leave her, too, a part of all he had missed in life, by his sane and steady pursuit of wealth. All! What had he missed? 'Dutch Fishing Boats' responded blankly; he crossed to the French window, and drawing the curtain aside, opened it. A wind had got up, and one of last year's oak leaves which had somehow survived the gardener's brooms, was dragging itself with a tiny clicking rustle along the stone terrace in the twilight. Except for that it was very quiet out there, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> heliotrope watered not long since. A bat went by. A bird uttered its last 'cheep.' And right above the oak tree the first star shone. Faust in the opera had bartered his soul for some fresh years of youth. Morbid notion! No such bargain was possible, that was real tragedy! No making oneself new again for love or life or anything. Nothing left to do but enjoy beauty from afar off while you could, and leave it something in your Will. But how much? And, as if he could not make that calculation looking out into the mild freedom of the country night, he turned back and went up to the chimney-piece. There were his pet bronzes--a Cleopatra with the asp at her breast; a Socrates; a greyhound playing with her puppy; a strong man reining in some horses. 'They last!' he thought, and a pang went through his heart. They had a thousand years of life before them! ...|$|E
50|$|The {{aromatic}} {{smell of}} sassafras {{was described by}} early European settlers arriving in North America. According to one legend, Christopher Columbus found North America because <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> scent of sassafras. As early as the 1560s, French visitors to North America discovered the medicinal qualities of sassafras, which was also exploited by the Spanish who arrived in Florida. English settlers at Roanoke reported surviving on boiled sassafras leaves and dog meat during times of starvation.|$|E
60|$|He spent a {{long time}} on the balcony; he hung over it as he had seen little Bilham hang the day of his first approach, as he had seen Mamie hang over her own the day little Bilham himself might have seen her from below; he passed back into the rooms, the three that {{occupied}} the front and that communicated by wide doors; and, while he circulated and rested, tried to recover the impression that they had made on him three months before, to catch again the voice in which they had seemed then to speak to him. That voice, he had to note, failed audibly to sound; which he took as the proof of all the change in himself. He had heard, of old, only what <b>he</b> <b>COULD</b> then hear; what <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do now was to think of three months ago as a point in the far past. All voices had grown thicker and meant more things; they crowded on him as he moved about--it was the way they sounded together that wouldn't let him be still. He felt, strangely, as sad as if he had come for some wrong, and yet as excited as if he had come for some freedom. But the freedom was what was most in the place and the hour, it was the freedom that most brought him round again to the youth of his own that he had long ago missed. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> have explained little enough to-day either why he had missed it or why, after years and years, he should care that he had; the main truth of the actual appeal of everything was none the less that everything represented the substance of his loss put it within reach, within touch, made it, to a degree it had never been, an affair of the senses. That was what it became for him at this singular time, the youth he had long ago missed--a queer concrete presence, full of mystery, yet full of reality, which <b>he</b> <b>could</b> handle, taste, <b>smell,</b> <b>the</b> deep breathing of which <b>he</b> <b>could</b> positively hear. It was in the outside air as well as within; it was in the long watch, from the balcony, in the summer night, of the wide late life of Paris, the unceasing soft quick rumble, below, of the little lighted carriages that, in the press, always suggested the gamblers he had seen of old at Monte Carlo pushing up to the tables. This image was before him when he at last became aware that Chad was behind.|$|R
50|$|In {{a season}} 1 episode of Shameless, Frank Gallagher {{mentions}} that all <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> upon {{waking up in}} a Toronto park was Drakkar Noir.|$|R

5000|$|Tafero {{was to be}} {{executed}} by electrocution. The machine, dubbed [...] "Old Sparky", malfunctioned, causing six-inch flames to shoot out of Tafero's head. A member of the execution team had used a synthetic sponge rather than a sea sponge, which is necessary to provide greater conductivity and a quick death. In all, three jolts of electricity were required to execute Tafero, a process that took seven minutes. Prison inmates later claimed that 'Old Sparky' was [...] "fixed" [...] and tampered with to make Tafero's execution more like torture. One close inmate friend of Tafero later said <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> burning flesh of his friend for days after.|$|E
5000|$|Lineker {{described}} paedophile text slang, {{stating that}} [...] "BALTIMORA" [...] translates to [...] "literally, Im running at them now with my trousers down". Labour MP Syd Rapson related that paedophiles were using [...] "an area of internet {{the size of}} Ireland". Richard Blackwood stated that internet paedophiles could make computer keyboards emit noxious fumes to subdue children, subsequently sniffing a keyboard and claiming that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> fumes, which made him feel [...] "suggestible". Blackwood also warned watching parents that exposure to the fumes would make their children [...] "smell like hammers". Other notable figures appearing as themselves were Sebastian Coe, Michael Hames, Andy McNab, Kate Thornton, Barbara Follett MP and Gerald Howarth MP.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Whip {{visits and}} soon becomes {{intimate}} with Nicole, but Whip's drinking habits clash with Nicole's attempts to stay drug-free. Later, at a crew member's funeral, {{he attempts to}} persuade flight attendant Margaret (Tamara Tunie) who survived to tell the NTSB that he was sober. Whip then pays a visit to Ken after awaking from his coma. Ken sustained severe injuries due to the crash, meaning that he will most likely never pilot a plane ever again. Ken confides into Whip that {{on the day of}} the crash that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> alcohol on his breath. However, due to his religious beliefs Ken has decided not to challenge it, stating to Whip that he has a 'higher plan' for him. Nicole decides to separate from Whip, following his failed attempts to stay sober.|$|E
60|$|The exact {{locality}} of {{the fire}} was plain {{to him as he}} neared home. <b>He</b> soon <b>could</b> hear the shout of men, the flapping of the flames, the crackling of burning wood, and <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> smoke from the conflagration.|$|R
