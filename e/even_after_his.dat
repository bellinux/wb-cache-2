5|$|By 1472, {{at the age}} of twenty, Leonardo {{qualified}} as a master in the Guild of Saint Luke, the guild of artists and doctors of medicine, but <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>his</b> father set him up in his own workshop, his attachment to Verrocchio was such that he continued to collaborate with him.

He won a public speaking award for a speech he made to an Adelaide literary society.|$|E

5|$|Sarah's {{concern for}} her grandchildren briefly {{came to a}} halt, however, when in 1716 her husband had two strokes, the second of which left him without the ability to speak.

5|$|The {{effect of}} Rupert's actions, <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>his</b> forces disengaged, was to force another {{delay in the}} Parliamentarian retreat; Essex spent much of 19 September looking after wounded {{soldiers}} and, when he finally managed to begin moving again, he was confronted with swampland and bog which further delayed him while the Royalists marched across the relatively open chalk downs above the Kennet. These hardships meant that the Royalists arrived at Newbury before Essex, with both armies settling down for the night outside the town, too exhausted to immediately fight.|$|E
60|$|On the <b>evening</b> <b>after</b> <b>his</b> arrival he strolled {{along the}} terrace talking to her.

5|$|In Globe, Arizona, Burnham unwittingly {{joined the}} losing side of the Pleasant Valley War before mass killing started, and only {{narrowly}} escaped death. He had no stake in the feud, but he was drawn into the conflict by his association with the Gordon family. Once the killing started, {{he felt he had}} to join a faction as a hired gun, although it put him {{on the wrong side of}} the law. In between raids and forays, he practiced incessantly with his pistol; he learned to shoot using either hand and from the back of a galloping horse. <b>Even</b> <b>after</b> <b>his</b> faction admitted defeat (the feud would begin again years later), Burnham still had many enemies.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} panel {{had sought}} Cho's medical records for several weeks, {{but due to}} privacy laws, Virginia Tech was prohibited from releasing them without permission from Cho's family, <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>his</b> death. The panel had considered using subpoenas to obtain his records. On June 12, 2007, Cho's family released his medical records to the panel, although the panel said that the records were not enough. The panel obtained additional information by court order. Like the perpetrators of both the Columbine and Jokela school massacres, Cho was prescribed the antidepressant drug Prozac prior to his rampage, a substance suspected by Peter Breggin and David Healy of leading to suicidal behaviors. It is not known if Cho ever complied in filling or taking this prescription; or if he had taken and then discontinued the prescribed medication. The toxicology test from the official autopsy later showed that neither psychiatric nor any kind of illegal drugs were in his system {{during the time of}} the shooting.|$|E

5|$|The {{ruins of}} Jokpo Hermitage (’jog po ri khrod) {{is located in}} the far western end of the Nyang bran Valley. The former {{property}} of the Jokpo Lama’s estate before the Chinese invasion in 1959, it originally served as the meditation retreat of a monk named ’Jog po rin po che of the Sera Mé College. The monk was a great meditator and according to tradition, after he died, his body remained in a state of perpetual meditative equipoise and was kept inside the Zhungpa Regional House temple where the monks reported that his hair and nails continued to grow <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>his</b> death. Before the Chinese invasion his body was buried and decayed and when the regional house (khang tshan) was rebuilt in the 1980s, his bones were exhumed. These are today placed inside the altar's clay statue in the regional house temple.|$|E
5|$|Once inside, Roy {{is shown}} the true history of The Scouring. The dragons, despite their power, {{were unable to}} {{maintain}} their numbers due to how slowly they reproduced compared to humans. As the war came to a close, the surviving Fire Dragons captured a Divine Dragon named Idunn and sealed away her soul. Enslaved to their will, Idunn reproduced dragons at an incredible rate and {{became known as the}} Demon Dragon, but she was defeated by a warrior wielding the Binding Blade. Her power was locked away until Zephiel, disgusted at humanity's failings, released her out of his insane desire to return Elibe to the dragons. As she has no emotion or free will, Idunn continues to follow Zephiel's orders <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>his</b> death and threatens to raise a dragon army that will destroy everything on the continent. On the topmost floor of the temple, the Etrurian Army battles Idunn's endlessly spawning dragons, allowing Roy to deliver the final blow on her with the Binding Blade. This does not kill her, and Roy carries her out as the temple collapses behind him. In the war's wake, Elibe begins to rebuild itself. Guinivere is named the new ruler of Bern, while Elffin returns to Etruria after his long absence. Roy and Lilina become the new marquesses of Pherae and Ostia, while Idunn is taken to Arcadia and lives with Fae as her soul slowly returns to her.|$|E

60|$|As every <b>evening,</b> <b>after</b> <b>his</b> day's {{writing was}} done, the proofs of the {{beginning}} of his work came home for correction, Isabel would read them to him. They were replete with errors; but preoccupied by the thronging, and undiluted, pure imaginings of things, he became impatient of such minute, gnat-like torments; he randomly corrected the worst, and let the rest go; jeering with himself at the rich harvest thus furnished to the entomological critics.|$|R
