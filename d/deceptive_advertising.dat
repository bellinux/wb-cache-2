25|$|Patent {{medicines}} {{were one}} of the first major product categories that the advertising industry promoted; patent medicine promoters pioneered many advertising and sales techniques that were later used for other products. Patent medicine advertising often marketed products as being medical panaceas (or at least a treatment for a large number of diseases) and emphasized exotic ingredients and endorsements from purported experts or celebrities, which may or may have not been true. Patent medicines were increasingly constricted in the United States in the early 20th century as the Food and Drug Administration and Federal Trade Commission added ever-increasing regulations to prevent fraud, unintentional poisoning and <b>deceptive</b> <b>advertising.</b> Sellers of liniments, claimed to contain snake oil and falsely promoted as a cure-all, made the snake oil salesman a lasting symbol for a charlatan.|$|E

500|$|During {{hearings}} on November 25, 2015, Judge Manuel J. Mendez disputed assertions by {{the services that}} a player's choice of athletes represents [...] "control or influence" [...] over the outcome, stating that players are ultimately [...] "relying on someone else's skill" [...] to determine an outcome. On December 11, 2015, the temporary injunction was granted, forbidding DraftKings and FanDuel from [...] "accepting entry fees, wagers or bets" [...] from residents of New York state. Mandez argued that [...] "the payment of an 'entry fee' as high as $10,600 on one or more contests daily could certainly be deemed risking 'something of value'." [...] He also ruled that the UIGEA [...] "has no corresponding authority under New York State law". However, Mandez granted a temporary stay following requests for an appeal. On December 31, 2015—prior to an appeals court on whether they could continue to operate during the lawsuit, the Attorney General amended the lawsuit to demand that the two companies pay restitution—including the return of all money collected from customers in New York State. Schneiderman also acknowledged the services' <b>deceptive</b> <b>advertising</b> practices, such as [...] "convoluted" [...] first deposit bonuses.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{substantive}} developments {{in the delivery of}} marketing activities in recent years has undoubtedly been the emergence and growth of Internet shopping. This relatively new form of communication has revolutionised the buying and selling of products and services, enabling customers to select and import items – many of which are not available through local shop fronts – directly from vendors around the world with the click of a button, and often at a reduced price. Although online shopping has provided a new international landscape to conduct business, the use of this medium and the absence of face-to-face interactions has presented the law with numerous challenges in terms of the scope of consumer protection. This article examines {{the nature and extent of}} misleading and <b>deceptive</b> online <b>advertising</b> and looks at the degree to which common law and legislation have evolved to deal with false, <b>deceptive</b> or misleading <b>advertising</b> on the Internet.

40|$|More than {{a decade}} has passed since the {{conclusion}} of the Minnesota tobacco trial and the signing of the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) by 46 US State Attorneys General and the US tobacco industry. The Minnesota settlement exposed the tobacco industry's long history of <b>deceptive</b> marketing, <b>advertising,</b> and research and ultimately forced the industry to change its business practices. The provisions for public document disclosure that were included in the Minnesota settlement and the MSA have resulted in the release of approximately 70 million pages of documents and nearly 20, 000 other media materials. No comparable dynamic, voluminous, and contemporaneous document archive exists. Only a few single events in the history of public health have had as dramatic an effect on tobacco control as the public release of the tobacco industry's previously secret internal documents. This review highlights the genesis of the release of these documents, the history of the document depositories created by the Minnesota settlement, the scientific and policy output based on the documents, {{and the use of the}} documents in furthering global public health strategies...|$|R

50|$|Justice Stewart wrote a {{concurrence}} {{explaining how}} {{the holding of}} this did not limit the states’ ability to restrict <b>deceptive</b> or false <b>advertising.</b> He cited various libel cases to demonstrate that while the press cannot be harshly restricted for fear that journalists may occasionally get their facts wrong, an advertiser {{is much more likely}} to know whether or not the material he was publishing was true. Thus, states should have greater latitude in regulating the content of advertisements for the veracity of their content. Even though commercial advertising and ideological expression are clearly different, advertisements which convey truthful information are worthy of First Amendment protection, and the elimination of deceptive claims serves to further the goal of the free flow of accurate and reliable information.|$|R
