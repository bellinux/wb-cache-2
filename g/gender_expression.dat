5|$|Sexuality is an {{important}} part of each person's identity, although some people might have no interest in sex. Sexuality has biological, psychological, emotional, spiritual, social, and cultural aspects. It involves not only sexual behaviors but relationships, self-image, sex drive, reproduction, sexual orientation, and <b>gender</b> <b>expression.</b> Each person's sexuality is influenced by lifelong socialization, in which factors such as religious and cultural background play a part, and is expressed in self-esteem and the beliefs one holds about oneself (identifying as a woman, or as an attractive person).|$|E
25|$|The Gender Identity, <b>Gender</b> <b>Expression</b> and Sex Characteristics Act, {{approved}} by Parliament in 2015, also prohibits {{discrimination on the}} basis of sex characteristics thereby protecting intersex people from discrimination.|$|E

50|$|In November 2014, {{realizing that}} The University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC) was {{probably}} the only UK University {{that did not have}} a society focused on LGBTQIA issues, students and alumni decided to create one. The founders of Diversity are from a broad spectrum of different sexual orientations, gender identities, and <b>gender</b> <b>expressions.</b>|$|R

25|$|The term queer {{migration}} {{is used to}} describe the movement of LGBTQ people around the world often to escape discrimination or ill treatment due to their orientation or <b>gender</b> <b>expression.</b> Organizations such as the Iranian Railroad for Queer Refugees attempt to assist individuals in such relocations.|$|E
25|$|Transgender {{people have}} a gender {{identity}} or <b>gender</b> <b>expression</b> that differs from their assigned sex. Other definitions of transgender also include people who belong to a third gender, or conceptualize transgender people as a third gender. Infrequently, the term transgender is defined very broadly to include cross-dressers, regardless of their gender identity.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to ONE, Inc. studies, more conservative homophile organizations of the 1950s, {{such as the}} Daughters of Bilitis, discouraged butch-femme roles and identities. This was especially true {{in relation to the}} butch identity, as the organization held the belief that assimilation into heterosexual society was the goal of the homophile movement. <b>Gender</b> <b>expressions</b> outside of the norm prevented assimilation.|$|R

25|$|Hypatias {{associate}} editors {{became involved}} in a damaging dispute in April 2017 when they failed to support a Hypatia author who came under attack on social media. The dispute was triggered by an article in that year's spring edition that argued in favour of accepting transracialism by comparing it to changing <b>gender</b> <b>expression.</b>|$|E

25|$|Sam Malloy (Aidan Mitchell) – Sam, the {{youngest}} Malloy child, is transgender and frequently dresses in feminine clothing. The idea for Sam's non-binary <b>gender</b> <b>expression</b> came about before Izzard—a gender non-conforming comedian—joined the show. Sam's <b>gender</b> <b>expression</b> is accepted and respected {{by their parents}} and siblings. On their first night in the Rich home, Sam draws a large mural on a bedroom wall depicting the family's recent adventures, including the car accident and Dahlia's release from prison. In addition to artistic skill, Sam is interested in French and very earnest about getting a good education. Like {{the rest of the}} family, Sam appears to be very clever and adept at trickery. In episode 3, Sam is the key player in an elaborate con of Dahlia's to get the Malloy children into Rosemere Academy. During the season 1 finale, Sam expresses reluctance and even denial in leaving Eden Falls.|$|E
2500|$|Consequential {{amendments}} to fourteen other acts and one Regulation. All but one amendment modified context-critical <b>gendered</b> <b>expression</b> (e.g. [...] "husband and wife") to be inclusive of same-sex couples. The single other amendment was to repeal section 30(2) of the Births, Deaths, Marriages and Relationships Registration Act 1955, which prevented birth registrars changing someone's legal gender {{if the person}} in question was married - the introduction of same-sex marriage meant this section was no longer needed.|$|R
50|$|The {{discrimination}} {{protections for}} sexual orientation in employment were added in 1991. In 2005 protections were extended to housing and in 2006 to public accommodations, both for sexual orientation and <b>gender</b> identity or <b>expression.</b> In 2011, <b>gender</b> identity or <b>expression</b> protections were extended to employment.|$|R

Such {{guidelines}} set ideals {{to which}} the American Psychological Association encourages psychologists to aspire. According to the [...] "Guidelines for Psychological Practice with Transgender and Gender Nonconforming People", psychologists who work with transgender or gender nonconforming people should seek to provide acceptance, support and understanding without making assumptions about their clients’ gender identities or <b>gender</b> <b>expressions.</b>|$|R
25|$|Wuvulu-Aua {{does not}} have known <b>gender</b> <b>expression</b> for pronouns. It does {{distinguish}} between singular, dual, and plural usage of pronouns. The 3rd person singular uses the same prefix as 1st and 2nd person pronouns, i. Only 1st person pronouns can be inclusive or exclusive. The plural form of pronouns originally referred {{to a group of}} three, but eventually changed to refer to three or more.|$|E
25|$|Applicants {{can change}} their gender {{identity}} documents by simply filing an affidavit with a notary, eliminating any requirement for medical gender reassignment procedures under the Gender Identity, <b>Gender</b> <b>Expression</b> And Sex Characteristics Act. In December 2016, the Act was amended to allow minors who are sixteen {{and over to}} have their gender changed without needing to file and application in court and parental approval. In November 2015, the Minister of Home Affairs informed that 40 people had legally changed their gender since enactment of the law mentioned above.|$|E
25|$|Transgender people {{experience}} a mismatch between their gender identity or <b>gender</b> <b>expression</b> and their assigned sex. Transgender {{is also an}} umbrella term because, in addition to including trans men and trans women whose binary gender identity {{is the opposite of}} their assigned sex (and who are sometimes specifically termed transsexual if they desire medical assistance to transition), it may include genderqueer people (whose identities are not exclusively masculine or feminine, but may, for example, be bigender, pangender, genderfluid, or agender). Other definitions include third-gender people as transgender or conceptualize transgender people as a third gender, and infrequently the term is defined very broadly to include cross-dressers.|$|E
50|$|Gender {{policing}} is {{the imposition}} or enforcement of normative <b>gender</b> <b>expressions</b> {{on an individual}} who is perceived as not adequately performing, through appearance or behavior, the sex that was assigned to them at birth (see gender performativity). Gender policing serves to devalue or delegitimize expressions that deviate from normative conceptions of gender, thus reinforcing the gender binary. According to Judith Butler, rejection of individuals who are non-normatively gendered is a component of creating one's own gender identity. Gender mainstreaming is a public policy concept, whereas gender policing is a more general social phenomenon.|$|R
50|$|Adolescence is a {{developmental}} stage in which peer groups are especially important, and peer relationships take primacy over familial relationships. It {{is also a}} stage during which gender policing amongst peers becomes increasingly common. Adolescents have already been introduced, during childhood, to normative <b>gender</b> <b>expressions</b> and social expectations therein by elders. These expectations are then reinforced during adolescence, largely by peers gender policing one another. In this (and every) stage of development, gender policing is especially prevalent in explicitly gendered environments, such as bathrooms, locker rooms, and sports teams.|$|R
50|$|An {{understanding}} of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender {{people as a}} minority group or groups has gained prominence in the Western world since the 19th century. The abbreviation LGBT is currently used to group these identities together. The term queer is sometimes understood as an umbrella term for all non-normative sexuality and <b>gender</b> <b>expressions,</b> but does not always seek {{to be understood as}} a minority; rather, as with many gay liberationists of the 1960s and 1970s, it sometimes represents an attempt to uncover and embrace the sexual diversity in everyone.|$|R
25|$|The {{organization}} educates LGBT {{people about}} their rights as workers, the organized labor {{movement and the}} principles of trade union solidarity; encourages and assists LGBT workers to organize and to become active participants in the trade union movement; opposes discrimination {{on the job and}} in unions based on sex, gender identity, <b>gender</b> <b>expression,</b> sexual orientation, race, national or ethnic origin, age, disability, religion or political views; encourages LGBT workers to register and vote to exercise their full rights and responsibilities of citizenship at the local, state and national levels; and educates the union movement and the public about the economic and social needs and interests of LGBT workers.|$|E
25|$|As {{attitudes towards}} {{alternative}} sexualities have broadened, and as gay styles {{have become increasingly}} mainstream, {{there has been a}} loosening of the boundaries between male and female styles. Through which Rusty Barrett refers to as indexical disjuncture, it is possible that an index is disconnected from the social meaning it used to be linked to. In the 1980s, Bear style emerged in response to the dominant ideologies in the gay community that marginalized heavyset men. Bear culture emphasizes size and hairiness while still embracing qualities and endeavors associated with women, which is, however, counter-cultural with respect to both heteronormativity as well as the dominant gay aesthetic. After all, the boundaries of <b>gender</b> <b>expression</b> are loosened.|$|E
25|$|Discrimination {{regarding}} {{sexual orientation}} and gender identity and expression has been banned nationwide since 2004. Gays, lesbians and bisexuals {{have been allowed}} to openly serve in the military since 2002. Gender identity and intersex rights in Malta are of the highest standard in the world under the Gender Identity, <b>Gender</b> <b>Expression</b> And Sex Characteristics Act. Same-sex marriage has been legal since September 2017 and prior to that civil unions (which are equal to marriage in all but name, with the same rights and obligations including joint adoption rights) were enacted in April 2014. However assisted reproduction is pending and access to surrogacy is banned for all. A 2015 opinion poll indicated {{that a majority of the}} public support same-sex marriage, with a significant increase over a decade. Legislation allowing same-sex marriage was approved by the parliament on 12 July 2017.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{transgender}} {{identities are}} becoming more widely known, {{as a result of}} contact with other cultures of the Western world. These newer identities, sometimes known under the umbrella use of the term [...] "genderqueer", along with the older travesti term, are known as non-binary and go along with binary transgender identities (those traditionally diagnosed under the now obsolete label of [...] "transsexualism") under the single umbrella of transgender, but are distinguished from cross-dressers and drag queens and kings, that are held as nonconforming <b>gender</b> <b>expressions</b> rather than transgender gender identities when a distinction is made.|$|R
5000|$|... "Travesti" [...] was {{initially}} a pejorative term, {{with the same}} connotation its cognates in other European languages have, but has been [...] "reclaimed" [...] by Argentinian, Brazilian and Peruvian travesti activists. This move also had anti-colonial undertones, as it was already recognized by some {{at that point that}} in pre-Columbian American societies and in pre-slavery Africa, a third gender was socially recognised (e.g. Muxe, Two-Spirits, Cogender), until they were supplanted by the dominant Western views on gender (in which both alternative <b>gender</b> <b>expressions</b> and those adopting them were then classified as deviant) to the death penalty in some cases.|$|R

25|$|Adolescent {{girls and}} boys who are {{attracted}} to others {{of the same sex}} are strongly affected by their surroundings in that adolescents often decide to express their sexualities or keep them secret depending on certain factors in their societies. These factors affect {{girls and boys}} differently. If girls’ schools and religions are against same sex attractions, they pose the greatest obstacles to girls who experience same sex attractions. These factors were not listed as affecting boys as much. The researchers suggest that maybe this is because not only are some religions against same-sex attraction, but they also encourage traditional roles for women and do not believe that women can carry out these roles as lesbians. Schools may affect girls more than boys because strong emphasis is placed on girls to date boys, and many school activities place high importance on heterosexuality (such as cheerleading). Additionally, the idea of not conforming to typical male gender roles inhibited many boys from openly expressing their same-sex attraction. The worry of conforming to gender roles didn’t inhibit girls from expressing their same-gender preferences as much, because society is generally more flexible about their <b>gender</b> <b>expression.</b>|$|E
25|$|Gender {{identity}} is one's personal experience of one's own gender. Gender identity can correlate with assigned sex at birth, or can differ from it completely. All societies {{have a set}} of gender categories that can serve as the basis of the formation of a person's social identity in relation to other members of society. In most societies, there is a basic division between gender attributes assigned to males and females, a gender binary to which most people adhere and which includes expectations of masculinity and femininity in all aspects of sex and gender: biological sex, gender identity, and <b>gender</b> <b>expression.</b> In all societies, some individuals do not identify with some (or all) of the aspects of gender that are assigned to their biological sex; In some cases, a person's gender {{identity is}} inconsistent with their biological sex characteristics (genitals and secondary sex characteristics), resulting in individuals dressing and/or behaving in a way which is perceived by others as outside cultural gender norms. These gender expressions may be described as gender variant, transgender, or genderqueer (there is an emerging vocabulary for those who defy traditional gender identity), and people who have such expressions may experience gender dysphoria (traditionally called Gender Identity Disorder or GID). Transgender individuals are greatly affected by language and gender pronouns before, during, and after their transition.|$|E

[...] "This film will highlight landmark mainstream stories and provide a glimpse at others that will change the gender landscape of the world forever.

[...] Jackson is working behind-the-scenes on the movie and will also take part in some of the on-camera interviews as well.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, {{awareness}} and education amongst Japanese people, specifically pertaining to queer issues has improved and information is now readily available. In the past, society often ignored queer lifestyles, thus interpreting their sexual and <b>gender</b> <b>expressions</b> as a disease. Now, with {{the influx of}} queer magazines, research, interviews, case studies, auto-biographies, journals and activism, more people have a relatively accepting and respectful attitude towards queers, their life-styles and choices. The availability of literature, information and formal representation of queer voices has helped many young Japanese to identify themselves with sexual minority groups. More importantly, awareness has opened a mode of communication between mainstream Japanese society and Queer people in Japan.|$|R
5000|$|Hammams are gendered spaces where being a {{woman or}} a man can make someone {{included}} or [...] "other." [...] Therefore, they represent a very special departure from the public sphere in which one is physically exposed amongst other women or men. This declaration of sexuality merely by being nude makes hammams a site of <b>gendered</b> <b>expression.</b> One exception to this gender segregation {{is the presence of}} young boys who often accompany their mothers until they grow old enough to necessitate attending the male hammam with their fathers. The separation from the women’s hammam and entrance to the male hammam usually occurs at the age of 5 or 6.|$|R
