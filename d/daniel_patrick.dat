5|$|The family {{structure}} of African-Americans {{has long been}} a matter of national public policy interest.

5|$|The race {{began in}} November 1998 when four-term {{incumbent}} New York Senator <b>Daniel</b> <b>Patrick</b> Moynihan announced his retirement. Both the Democratic Party and Republican Party sought high-profile candidates {{to compete for}} the open seat. By early 1999 Clinton and Mayor of New York City Rudolph Giuliani were the likely respective nominees. Clinton and her husband, President Bill Clinton, purchased a house in Chappaqua, New York, in September 1999; she thereby became eligible for the election, although she faced characterizations of carpetbagging since she had never resided in the state before. The lead in statewide polls swung from Clinton to Giuliani and back to Clinton as the campaigns featured both successful strategies and mistakes as well as dealing with current events. In late April and May 2000, Giuliani's medical, romantic, marital, and political lives all collided in a tumultuous four-week period, culminating in his withdrawing from the race on May 19.|$|E

5|$|When New York's long-serving U.S. Senator <b>Daniel</b> <b>Patrick</b> Moynihan {{announced}} his retirement in November 1998, several prominent Democratic figures, including Representative Charles Rangel of New York, urged Clinton to run for Moynihan's open seat in the Senate election of 2000. Once she decided to run, the Clintons purchased a home in Chappaqua, New York, north of New York City, in September 1999. She became the first First Lady of the United States to {{be a candidate for}} elected office. Initially, Clinton expected to face Rudy Giuliani (the mayor of New York City) as her Republican opponent in the election. Giuliani withdrew from the race in May 2000 after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and matters related to his failing marriage became public and Clinton instead faced Rick Lazio, a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives representing New York's 2nd congressional district. Throughout the campaign, opponents accused Clinton of carpetbagging, as she had never resided in New York nor participated in the state's politics before the 2000 Senate race.|$|E

25|$|The closest {{relatives}} of M. vivesi are other New World species of Myotis {{which are not}} adapted to piscivory, {{rather than the other}} piscivorous bats in the genus.

A fossil species of Pizonyx, Pizonyx wheeleri, was named by Walter Dalquest and <b>Daniel</b> <b>Patrick</b> in 1993 from the Miocene of Texas, but according to a 1993 review by Nicholas Czaplewski, this species instead belongs to the genus Antrozous and may not even be distinct from the living species Antrozous pallidus.|$|E
