While Olajuwon never {{expressed}} an interest in coaching a team, he wishes to give back to the game by helping younger players.

500|$|Frusciante's {{approach}} to album composition has changed. On his early recordings, he welcomed sonic imperfections, noting that [...] "even on [...] there are off-pitch vocals and out-of-tune guitars." [...] However, on later albums such as Shadows Collide With People, he pursued the opposite: [...] "I just wanted {{everything to be}} perfect—I didn't want anything off pitch, or off time, or any unintentional this or that." [...] Frusciante views songwriting as taking time, and does not force it: [...] "If a song wants to come to me, I'm always ready to receive it, but I don't work at it." [...] Much of his solo material is first written on an acoustic or unamplified electric guitar. He also prefers to record his albums on analog tapes and other relatively primitive equipment. This preference stems from his belief that older equipment can actually speed up the recording process, and that modern computerized recording technology gives only an illusion of efficiency. Frusciante tries to streamline the recording process as much as possible, because he thinks [...] "music comes alive when [...] are creating it fast". He also enjoys the challenge of having to record something in very few takes, and believes that when musicians are unable to handle the pressure of having to record something quickly they often get frustrated or bogged down by perfectionism. With his focus on new styles of music, Frusciante describes having worked with the computer as an instrument, and having found the ability to merge old and new production techniques together. He has noted {{that there has been}} a change in how he works on an album. In the past he would work on one song at a time, but with the new [...] "Progressive Synth Pop" [...] that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> on, he feels much more comfortable to work within the album as a whole. He currently uses the music tracker Renoise as his main Digital audio workstation along with some drum machines, sequencers, and other hardware, along with his Doepfer, Arp, and other modular synthesizers.|$|E
