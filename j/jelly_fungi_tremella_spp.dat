50|$|Stereum sanguinolentum is {{a species}} of fungus in the Stereaceae family. A plant pathogen, it causes red heart rot, a red {{discoloration}} on conifers, particularly spruces or Douglas-firs. Fruit bodies are produced on dead wood, or sometimes on dead branches of living trees. They are a thin leathery crust of the wood surface. Fresh fruit bodies will bleed a red-colored juice if injured, reflected in the common names bleeding Stereum or the bleeding conifer parchment. It can be {{the host of the}} parasitic <b>jelly</b> <b>fungus</b> <b>Tremella</b> encephala.|$|R

500|$|Tremella mesenterica (common names include yellow brain, golden <b>jelly</b> <b>fungus,</b> yellow trembler, and witches' butter) is {{a common}} <b>jelly</b> <b>fungus</b> in the Tremellaceae family of the Agaricomycotina. It is most {{frequently}} found on dead but attached and on recently fallen branches, especially of angiosperms, as a parasite of wood decay fungi in the genus Peniophora. The gelatinous, orange-yellow fruit body of the fungus, which can grow up to [...] diameter, has a convoluted or lobed surface that is greasy or slimy when damp. It grows in crevices in bark, appearing during rainy weather. Within {{a few days after}} rain it dries into a thin film or shriveled mass capable of reviving after subsequent rain. This fungus occurs widely in deciduous and mixed forests and is widely distributed in temperate and tropical regions that include [...] Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, North and South America. Although considered bland and flavorless, the <b>fungus</b> is edible. <b>Tremella</b> mesenterica produces carbohydrates that are attracting research interest because of their various biological activities.|$|R

50|$|A {{number of}} the <b>jelly</b> <b>fungi</b> can be eaten raw; {{poisonous}} <b>jelly</b> <b>fungi</b> are rare. However, many species have an unpalatable texture or taste.

However, some species, Tremella fuciformis for example, are not only edible but prized for use in soup and vegetable dishes.|$|R
50|$|Exidia glandulosa (common names black witches' butter, black jelly roll, or warty <b>jelly</b> <b>fungus)</b> is a <b>jelly</b> <b>fungus</b> in {{the family}} Auriculariaceae. It is a common, wood-rotting species in Europe, {{typically}} growing on dead attached branches of oak. The fruit bodies are up to 3 cm wide, shiny, black and blister-like, and grow singly or in clusters. Its occurrence elsewhere is uncertain because of confusion with the related species, Exidia nigricans.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Jelly</b> <b>fungi</b> are a paraphyletic {{group of}} several heterobasidiomycete fungal orders from {{different}} classes of the subphylum Agaricomycotina: Tremellales, Dacrymycetales, Auriculariales and Sebacinales. [...] These fungi are {{so named because}} their foliose, irregularly branched fruiting body is, or appears to be, the consistency of jelly. Actually, many are somewhat rubbery and gelatinous. When dried, <b>jelly</b> <b>fungi</b> become hard and shriveled; when exposed to water, they return to their original form.|$|R

50|$|When {{it is on}} the ground, a Nostoc colony is ordinarily not seen, {{but after}} a rain, it swells up into a conspicuous, jellylike mass, which was once thought to have fallen from the sky, hence the popular names, star jelly, troll’s butter, witch's butter (not to be {{confused}} with the <b>fungus</b> <b>Tremella</b> mesenterica), and witch’s jelly.|$|R
5000|$|Stereum hirsutum, {{also called}} False Turkey Tail, [...] is a fungus {{typically}} forming multiple brackets on dead wood. It {{is also a}} plant pathogen infecting peach trees.

50|$|Donk {{preferred}} the name Exidia albida (Huds.) Bref. for this species, but most later authors have followed Reid in considering E. albida a nomen dubium (name of uncertain application) that might originally {{have referred to}} any whitish or transparent <b>jelly</b> <b>fungus.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Bandoni mainly {{studied the}} heterobasidiomycetes, {{commonly}} known as the [...] "Jelly Fungi". His early publications were of a classical taxonomical nature, writing descriptions of the macro- and micro-morphology via the light microscope. In the early 1970s Bandoni started studying aquatic fungi that occur in terrestrial environments. He published a paper in the journal Science that explained how spores can travel upwards on a monolayer of water on a leaf surface. In the 1980s Bandoni collaborated with Franz Oberwinkler and colleagues at the Universität Tübingen to produce over 20 papers on the <b>Jelly</b> <b>Fungi</b> and allies. They described new species, genera, families and orders. They used TEM and SEM micrographs to investigate the significance of septal pore structures, began revising the classical phylogenetic classification and to demonstrate parasitism between <b>Jelly</b> <b>Fungi</b> and other fungi. Bandoni collaborated with mycologists in Japan and other Asian countries. He was research fellow in 1983 at the University of Tsukuba and spent a sabbatical year at the University of Osaka. He wrote two field guides to Thailand mushrooms. Bandoni contributed to multiple publications on taxonomy in the <b>Jelly</b> <b>Fungi</b> up until his death.|$|R
