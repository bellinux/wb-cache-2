5|$|Agricultural and <b>forestry</b> <b>work</b> {{were the}} {{traditional}} {{uses of the}} Finnhorse. The Finnhorse was never bred to be a particularly large or heavy draught horse, {{as it was the}} only horse breed of the country, and versatility was desired as the Finnhorse was also used as the primary steed of the cavalry. The climate and conditions of Finland necessitated that the breed be durable and hardy. As a result, the Finnhorse remained small but tough, and could pull heavy loads in difficult terrain and even in chest-deep snow. Relative to its size, the Finnhorse is among the most powerful workhorses in the world with the best animals able to pull as much as 200percent of their own weight.|$|E
5|$|The best-known {{hallmark}} of Vanaja, the full-load lifting tandem axle, {{was introduced in}} January 1957. This invention enabled an additional load of 2.5 tonnes to be carried and the entire load on the tandem could be moved to the fore axle using an electro-hydraulic system. The system improved the traction, offering a significant advantage on slippery surfaces. The innovative lifting tandem was developed under leadership of the company's chief engineer Veikko Muronen. Vanaja became the leader in the Finnish logging vehicle market and maintained this position until production ceased. In <b>forestry</b> <b>work,</b> a layout with a driven front axle and a tandem axle with a driven fore axle, called 4×4+2, became famous in Finland but is seldom seen outside the Nordic countries.|$|E

5|$|At {{some point}} in their history, not clearly documented, horses bred in the western regions {{crossbred}} with horses that originated south of the Gulf of Finland. This made the western Finnish horse type larger and better suited to farming and <b>forestry</b> <b>work.</b> The characteristics of the original western Finnish type prevailed, however, even though influenced by outside blood and traces of outside influence could be detected for a long time. Later, this mixed type was further crossbred with larger horses from Central Europe during the Middle Ages. Foreign horses were also brought to Finland during military campaigns, and additional animals were imported to manor houses for driving. The crossbreed offspring of Central European and Finnish horses were larger than their Finnish parents, and even more suited for agricultural work.|$|E
5|$|The Boulonnais {{is still}} bred in small numbers, with the American Boulonnais Horse Association {{estimating}} {{a population of}} fewer than 1,000 animals remaining in Europe. Many studs are government-funded, to prevent the breed from dying out. The majority of the breed, 95 percent, {{are located in the}} Nord-Pas-de-Calais and Normandy regions and 75 percent in just the Pas-de-Calais department of Nord-Pas-de-Calais alone. Although most Boulonnais are in France, a few are exported. In 1999, fifteen foals were exported to Brazil and one stallion to Argentina. On average, a little over a dozen horses a year are exported, mainly to Brazil and Belgium for breeding and to Germany for <b>forestry</b> <b>work.</b> A few horses live in the Netherlands, Switzerland and Luxembourg, as well as in North America. Since 2006, twenty horses, including two registry-approved breeding stallions, have been exported from France to Denmark to create a stud farm in that country.|$|E

It was incorporated on the 2nd of September in 1955. The company’s equipment {{has been used for}} projects including cement plant repairs, sea port operations, bridge construction, canal expansion (including the Panama Canal), mass transit construction, sports arenas, and power plant installations as well as repairs, such as the Chernobyl Nuclear Plant. Sarens has completed lifts with cranes stationed on both land and floating on the water. Lifts performed by Sarens have included world record total tonnages and methods.|$|R
40|$|The {{first phase}} of {{supplying}} forest products to the producer is comprised of the production activities performed in the forests. As these activities are hard and difficult works carried out in forests, occupational accidents and safety usually remain current issues. Since the topographic structure {{in most of the}} forests in Turkey are not suitable for working with machines, <b>forestry</b> <b>works</b> are mostly performed in a labour-intensive way. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the working conditions of seasonal workers employed in forestry activities, their attitudes regarding accidents and safety, and the measures taken. On the other hand, the problems women experience regarding <b>forestry</b> <b>works</b> and their expectations of their daily life spaces was also examined. The study was carried out in Provincial Department of Forestry of Cankırı. All the people who participated in the study came from different cities as seasonal workers and had poor working and living conditions...|$|R

500|$|The Finnhorse or Finnish Horse ( [...] , {{literally}} [...] "horse of Finland"; nickname: Suokki, or , literally [...] "finnish cold-blood") is a horse breed {{with both}} riding horse and draught horse influences and characteristics, {{and is the}} only breed developed fully in Finland. In English it is sometimes called the Finnish Universal, as the Finns consider the breed capable of fulfilling all of Finland's horse needs, including agricultural and <b>forestry</b> <b>work,</b> harness racing, and riding. In 2007, the breed was declared the official national horse breed of Finland.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after his}} return, Marshall {{was asked by}} Earle Clapp, head of the Forest Service's Branch of Research, to help {{initiate}} badly needed reforms in the forest-products industry {{and to create a}} broader vision of national forest management. Marshall moved to Washington, D.C. in September 1932 to assume the appointed position, which entailed writing initiatives for forest recreation. He immediately began compiling a list of the remaining roadless areas in the United States. He sent this data to regional foresters, urging them to set aside areas for wilderness; all of them responded negatively. Marshall's contributions to {{what became known as the}} Copeland Report amounted to three extensive chapters of a two-volume, 1,677-page work. He considered it [...] "the best piece of <b>forestry</b> <b>work</b> I have yet done." ...|$|E
500|$|Before World War I, {{thousands}} of Percherons were shipped from France to the United States, {{but after the}} war began, an embargo stopped shipping. The breed was used extensively in Europe during the war, with some horses being shipped from the US back to France {{to help in the}} war effort. Beginning in 1918, Percherons began to be bred in Great Britain, and in 1918 the British Percheron Horse Society was formed. After a series of name and studbook ownership changes, the current US Percheron registry was created in 1934. In the 1930s, Percherons accounted for 70 percent of the draft horse population in the United States, but their numbers declined substantially after [...] However, the population began to recover and as of 2009, around 2,500 horses were registered annually in the United States alone. The breed is still used extensively for draft work, and in France they are used for food. They have been crossed with several light horse breeds to produce horses for range work and competition. Purebred Percherons are used for <b>forestry</b> <b>work</b> and pulling carriages, as well as work under saddle, including competition in English riding disciplines such as show jumping.|$|E

Farmers can then reinvest this profit to start their own business, pay school fees for their children and receive improved healthcare.|$|R

It chanced that I had written a tale about Indian <b>Forestry</b> <b>work</b> which included a boy who had been brought up by wolves. In the stillness, and suspense, of the winter of ’92 some memory of the Masonic Lions of my childhood's magazine, and a phrase in Haggard's Nada the Lily, combined with the echo of this tale. After blocking out the main idea in my head, the pen took charge, and I watched it begin to write stories about Mowgli and animals, which later grew into the two Jungle Books [...] ". With Josephine's arrival, Bliss Cottage was felt to be congested, so eventually the couple bought land — [...] on a rocky hillside overlooking the Connecticut River — from Carrie's brother Beatty Balestier and built their own house.|$|E
