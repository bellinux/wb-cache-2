50|$|Prior to {{receiving}} electricity in 1986, {{most of the}} houses used propane gas, lamp oil and candle light {{as a means of}} lighting and heating their homes. And although <b>gas</b> <b>hobs</b> and ovens were the main method for cooking indoors, the preferred method for cooking is by means of open fires or braais (Afrikaans, meaning barbecue). Water inside the houses was in most cases heated by means of wall mounted gas units, prior to the availability of electricity. In some of the older houses in Vleesbaai, one can still come across redundant copper pipes that fed the various gas appliances. Many houses in Vleesbaai today operate on a combination of both electricity and liquified gas cylinders.|$|R
5000|$|Gas stoves {{became less}} {{unwieldy}} when the oven was {{integrated into the}} base and the size was reduced to fit in better {{with the rest of}} the kitchen furniture. By the 1910s, producers started to enamel their gas stoves for easier cleaning. Ignition of the gas was originally by match and this was followed by the more convenient pilot light. This had the disadvantage of a continual consumption of gas. The oven still needed to be lit by match, and accidentally turning on the gas without igniting it could lead to an explosion. To prevent these types of accidents, oven manufacturers developed and installed a safety valve called a flame failure device for <b>gas</b> <b>hobs</b> and ovens. Most modern gas stoves have electronic ignition, automatic timers for the oven and extractor hoods to remove fumes.|$|R

Larger models may include a water heater, space heating and air conditioning, a portable toilet and even an internal shower. Smaller models often carry a [...] "porta-potty" [...] portable toilet, and sometimes an external shower which operates within the privacy of an awning.|$|E
5000|$|The wok's most {{distinguishing}} feature is its shape. Classic woks have a rounded bottom. [...] Hand-hammered woks are sometimes flipped inside out after being shaped, giving the wok a gentle flare {{to the edge}} {{that makes it easier}} to push food up onto the sides of the wok. Woks sold in western countries are sometimes found with flat bottoms—this makes them more similar to a deep frying pan. The flat bottom allows the wok to be used on an electric stove, where a rounded wok {{would not be able to}} fully contact the stove's heating element. A round bottom wok enables the traditional round spatula or ladle to pick all the food up at the bottom of the wok and toss it around easily; this is difficult with a flat bottom. With a <b>gas</b> <b>hob,</b> or traditional pit stove, the bottom of a round wok can get hotter than a flat wok and so is better for stir frying.|$|E

50|$|Gas stoves today use {{two basic}} types of {{ignition}} sources, standing pilot and electric. A stove with a standing pilot has a small, continuously burning gas flame (called a pilot light) under the cooktop. The flame {{is between the}} front and back burners. When the stove is turned on, this flame lights the gas flowing out of the burners. The advantage of the standing pilot system is that it is simple and completely independent of any outside power source. A minor drawback is that the flames continuously consume fuel even when the stove is not in use. Early gas ovens did not have a pilot. One had to light these manually with a match. If one accidentally left the gas on, gas would fill the oven and eventually the room. A small spark, such as an arc from a light switch being turned on, could ignite the gas, triggering a violent explosion. To prevent these types of accidents, oven manufacturers developed and installed a safety valve called a flame failure device for <b>gas</b> <b>hobs</b> and ovens. The safety valve depends on a thermocouple that sends a signal to the valve to stay open. If a draft blows out the flame or it goes out due to loss of gas pressure, the thermocouple cools and signals the valve to close, shutting off the gas supply. In gas ranges that come with a flame failure device, lighting when there's no power can prove to {{be a bit of a}} challenge because unless the user is quick at lighting a match and then turning on the gas valve, the flame failure device cuts off the gas supply within seconds if it senses that the burner isn't lit and there's not much of a point trying to light it once it has already cut off the gas supply.|$|R
5000|$|Stan and Ollie {{work in a}} horn factory, where Hardy {{is already}} under stress from all the incessant noise. One worker (Eddie Borden) has already gone insane and is the latest {{casualty}} of the work environment. Ollie is sent home after developing [...] "hornophobia", which results in his going crazy each time he hears horns or horn-based musical instruments. A physician (Jimmy Finlayson) is called to treat Ollie and, warning Ollie that he could develop a more serious condition, [...] "hornomania," [...] prescribes a relaxing boat trip and goat's milk. Ollie dismisses the idea because he is afraid to sail on the ocean, but Stan offers an alternative: they will simply rent a boat and keep it attached to the dock, getting all the sea air they can while never actually going out to sea. A running gag in the episode is {{when one of the}} boys tries to turn on the taps and <b>gas</b> <b>hobs,</b> only for the one opposite to go on instead due to the janitor being cross-eyed, which results in Stan destroying half the kitchen area with a gas explosion and Ollie vowing to find the janitor and give him a very large piece of his mind. On the way down, Ollie is accosted by his Scottish neighbor who inquires as to whether he is having trouble with his apartment, then drags him into hers when he confirms it to be all [...] "topsy-turvy". She shows him what happened when she turned on her radio that morning (causing her fridge to loudly blare music when opened, while the radio itself is covered in an indiscernible white substance), causing Ollie to give the janitor a piece of her mind as well. When Stan's trombone teacher (Eddie Conrad) arrives and Ollie, returning from a fight with the janitor (Ben Turpin), hears the music, goes berserk and throws the teacher out, he knows he should take that advice. Phoning the hotel manager to complain why that teacher was allowed in, Hardy is accidentally knocked out the window and into the street.|$|R
40|$|The authors {{investigated}} {{the risk of}} wheezing illnesses in relation to contemporaneous pollutant exposures (gas cooking, heating, and smoking) in childhood and adolescence in a cohort of 2, 289 United Kingdom subjects. Data from two questionnaires assessing wheezing at ages 7 - 8 and 15 - 17 years and one questionnaire on current and past pollutant exposures at age 16 - 18 years were studied (1987 - 1996). The 1, 868 subjects returning all three questionnaires were divided into three groups representing childhood (10. 5 %), adolescent (10. 9 %), and persistent (i. e., both; 16. 3 %) wheezing and compared with 1, 165 controls (62. 4 %) without wheezing. The estimated risks of childhood wheezing were increased by exposure to any gas in childhood (odds ratio (OR) = 1. 47, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 05, 2. 04) and exposure to a <b>gas</b> <b>hob</b> in childhood (OR = 1. 56, 95 % CI: 1. 13, 2. 16) and were increased further in those persistently exposed. Risk of persistent wheezing in adolescence was paradoxically reduced by exposure to a <b>gas</b> <b>hob</b> (OR = 0. 67, 95 % CI: 0. 50, 0. 91), possibly because of selection avoidance. Contemporaneous exposure to combined smoking by both parents was associated with wheezing in all groups (odds ratios ranged from 1. 62 (95 % CI: 1. 06, 2. 46) to 1. 93 (95 % CI: 1. 10, 3. 38)). Maternal smoking alone was associated with persistent wheezing and with both childhood (OR = 1. 90, 95 % CI: 1. 06, 3. 39) and persistent (OR = 2. 18, 95 % CI: 1. 15, 4. 14) wheezing if smoking occurred throughout childhood and adolescence. The authors conclude that exposures to gas cooking and smoking in childhood and adolescence increase the overall risk of wheezing...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} {{domestic}} preparation regimes {{on the level}} of the heat-formed toxicant furan was studied to provide useful information for exposure assessment and advice for manufacturers and consumers. Foods were cooked in a saucepan on a <b>gas</b> <b>hob,</b> or microwaved and furan determined by headspace sampling and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In general furan levels did not decrease as much when foods were cooked in a microwave when compared to the same foods cooked in a saucepan. Furan levels decreased in most canned and jarred foods after heating in a saucepan. Low levels of furan in soups in cartons were not changed by any procedure. Furan decreased slightly in foods on standing before consumption but did so more rapidly on stirring. The levels also decreased slightly when foods were left to stand on plates, this observation is attributed to the volatility of furan...|$|E
30|$|Traditionally, {{household}} appliances use a single energy carrier {{to perform their}} function, usually electricity or gas, which cannot be substituted (Mauser et al. 2015). On the other hand, some devices can be supplied by multiple energy carriers, namely hot water, electricity, and gas, which are used alternatively or in parallel to operate (Mauser et al. 2017). This type of devices {{is referred to as}} hybrid and the potential benefit of their application have recently gained interest in literature (Mauser et al. 2015; Mauser et al. 2016; Stamminger et al. 2008). Although the idea of suppling from different energy carriers may sound far from reality, there are solutions already commercially available. Some dishwashers and washing machine can be connected to a hot water supply, drastically reducing the power demand, as the water is no longer internally heated (Stamminger et al. 2008). Gas clothes dryers heat the air by burning gas, while a hot water tumble dryer is equipped with a water-air heat exchanger (Stamminger et al. 2008). Additionally, dual-fuel cookers are widely used, combining gas hobs and electric ovens; although not yet commercially available, it could be possible to combine electricity and gas in the same cooking device (Mauser et al. 2017). Moreover, water can be boiled in an electric kettle or in a kettle (or a pot) placed on an electric hob, as well as in a kettle placed on a <b>gas</b> <b>hob</b> (Oberascher et al. 2011). The hot water needed for space heating and bathing can be provided by electric heaters as well as gas-burning boilers. An innovative alternative is being developed by Nerdalize (Nerdalize), which uses cloud servers as preheating systems in homes, reducing {{at the same time the}} consumptions of gas for house heating and of electricity for server cooling.|$|E
50|$|AGAs have {{recently}} been criticised for their high energy consumption and inefficiency. A small, traditional two-oven AGA running on gas will use approximately 425 kWh per week (22,100 kWh per year; perhaps half that if switched off during the summer months). The average standard <b>gas</b> oven and <b>hob</b> uses 580 kWh during a year, only 2.62% of the AGA's consumption.AGA's own figures for expected energy consumption for their two-oven AGA support this criticism, suggesting a weekly consumption of 40 litres of kerosene or diesel, 60 litres of propane gas, 425 kWh of natural gas or 220 kWh for the electric models. This would indicate that the smallest traditional two-oven gas AGA providing simple cooking functions (i.e,. no water heating or central heating) consumes almost as much gas in a week as a standard gas oven/hob does in nine months.|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a major drive for the {{adoption}} of energy efficient devices in the residential sector of South Africa. The introduction by the Utility (Eskom) of incentives for solar water heaters and heat pump water heaters, as well as the Residential Mass Rollout Program has tried to encourage this adoption. Since this is a decision by the consumer on which of the available technologies to choose from, a Hierarchical Decision Model (HDM) was created to try understand this decision. A survey was sent out to eleven consumers in South Africa and a pairwise comparison was used to determine the importance among the criteria and sub criteria {{that are part of the}} purchasing decision. It was determine that the criteria with the highest importance were Performance and Economic, while the lowest importance was Support and Service. The highest relative importance of the sub criteria to the goal was for Environmental Performance and the lowest was for Upgradability and Utility Incentives. The outcome of the model ranked the geyser controller the highest when incentives were not taken into account, and the heat pump water heater the highest when current incentives were included. The lowest ranked in both scenarios was the <b>gas</b> stove <b>hob.</b> This model can be used as an effective way of understanding consumers purchasing decisions as well as for ranking new energy efficient technologies against existing technologies before they enter the market...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND—Studies in {{children}} and young women have indicated {{an increased risk of}} respiratory illness in association with the use of domestic gas appliances, possibly caused by oxides of nitrogen generated when gas is burned. It is not known whether risks are similarly increased in older subjects.  METHODS—A questionnaire about respiratory symptoms in the past year and potential risk factors for respiratory disease was mailed to 6000 men and women aged 65 years and older who were selected at random from the lists of general practices in North Bristol, UK. Associations between symptoms and the use of gas appliances were examined by logistic regression with adjustment for age, sex, social class, and smoking habits.  RESULTS—Questionnaires were completed by 4792 (80 %) of those mailed. The most common symptoms were exercise induced breathlessness, wheeze, or chest tightness (51 %); wheeze (27 %); morning phlegm (20 %); and daytime breathlessness at rest (19 %). In an analysis that included all subjects only weak associations were found with use of gas appliances, odds ratios all being 1. 2 or less. The risks associated with use of a <b>gas</b> <b>hob</b> tended to be higher in women, with odds ratios of 1. 36 (95 % CI 1. 01 to 1. 83) for wheeze and 1. 33 (95 % CI 0. 56 to 3. 17) for morning chest tightness, but were lower than had been reported previously in younger women.  CONCLUSION—The absence of stronger associations cannot readily be explained by bias or confounding. Gas cookers and fires are unlikely to be an important cause of respiratory illness in the elderly. If they do cause such illness, the largest risks are likely to be in women who use gas hobs. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Functional Rehabilitation and Reeducation Centre (CRRF) in Noth in the {{department}} of Creuse in France is seeking permanent home automation solutions that help patients to safely have more autonomy in everyday life. An experimental apartment consisting of a bedroom, a bathroom and a kitchen was equipped with communicating devices and remote controls. The aim is to validate the possibility of returning home a patient who have stayed at the medical centre and have motor and cognitive disabilities. A Konnex EIB/KNX bus is used to interface all the sensors and actuators. In the bedroom, an environment controller allows to control objects often inaccessible to the patient because of his disability. Ambient and reading light, shutters, heating, nurse call and television are actuated by conventional switches which have been increased and relayed by the controller. Different functions of the bed can be remotely controlled such as the folding legs, the inclination of the headrest and the height of the bed. A contrast of the switches has been adapted for better visibility. Easily understandable pictograms have been added for an intuitive use. The bedroom door is managed through push up buttons that can be switched with the elbow for a person in a wheelchair. In the bathroom, occupancy sensors have been installed to adjust lighting for better use of toilets facilities. Counting of water associated with flood detection prevents and detects potential overflow of sanitary and bath. In the kitchen, the height of work plans and mobile furniture is adjustable by hand or knee to facilitate access for people with motor disabilities, with safety contacts in case of obstacles. Scenarios have been defined with ergo therapists to prevent the patient against electrical, gas and water dangers in the apartment. These scenarios are managed by a controller that determines the type and degree of danger: the high level (gas, iron, fire risk) and the low level for events that do not require immediate action (oven, electric hob, <b>gas</b> <b>hob,</b> coffee maker and microwave oven). The supervision software used enables the complete management of all alarms and commands transiting through the communication bus via a MODBUS TCP interface. Doctors and therapists will be able to follow the daily activities in the apartment to assess the ability of residents to return home. The system also targets the requirements of housing adjustment aimed at dependent persons returning to their homes...|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{environmental}} problems increasingly attract academic research {{in order to protect}} ecosystems and minimise negative effects on human health. Advanced computational environmental analysis technologies have the potential to detect, monitor and perhaps effectively control these problems. However, computational environmental analysis is a complex and difficult problem to solve. The problems associated with environmental analysis are the underlying data. These data are collected from sub-optimal positions in urban and rural areas. The limited number of monitoring stations in the network means that we are collecting enough samples over time, however, insufficient data samples are collected across the monitored area. We determined the difficulty associated with computational analysis of environmental data via a critical review of existing approaches in the literature. Our review confirmed the biggest problem was associated with data collection, including noise introduced into the data stream, the big data problem {{in the form of an}} endless data stream, and missing data samples caused by ineffective equipment or poor placement of the monitoring equipment. In this thesis, we document our research into computational environmental methods for addressing land usage and air quality problems. The detection of land use change is a process of identifying differences in the state of a phenomenon by observing time-lapsed landscape imagery. Motivated by a simple neural pattern recognition mechanism, we propose a novel “one-step-more” incremental learning change detection method. In this method, an agent discovers knowledge from the first image using pixel-level incremental learning. When we detect changes in the subsequent image, the discovered knowledge model is updated and ready for the next change detection iteration. This is what we have called the “one-step more” incremental learning method. Powered by incremental data modelling techniques, the system demonstrates the capability of continuously detecting time sequenced imagery. Additionally, the method is shown to be computationally inexpensive when initializing and updating the change detection model. Land encroachment monitoring is essential to assist the economic growth, sustainable resource use and environmental protection of a city. We investigate land encroachment on public parks in the area of Auckland New Zealand, in which the proposed “one-step-more” method employed to analyse 26 Auckland parks. The obtained average region of interest (ROI) detection accuracy is 99. 91 % on five popular park related objects i. e. fences, houses, parks, trees and roads. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on four categories of encroachment: periimanent land cover & use, and temporary & physical boundary encroachment. We document two detailed and comprehensive investigations of computational methods for air quality analysis. The first investigation is indoor emission source detection and the second is outdoor air quality prediction. Emission source detection indoors is important when locating the possible origin of pollution that could have a negative effect on the health of occupants. Outdoor air quality prediction is essential when attempting to minimise the negative effect on the health of citizens and the ecosystem. Addressing indoor emission source detection, we propose a novel inter-pollutant correlation analysis technique. Unlike other documented solutions that analyze merely primary pollution, our method is further enhanced by calculating intrapollutant correlation coefficients for characterizing and distinguishing emission events. Extensive experiments show that seven major indoor emission sources are identified by the proposed method, including (1) frying canola oil on electric hob, (2) frying olive oil on an electric hob, (3) frying olive oil on a <b>gas</b> <b>hob,</b> (4) spray of household pesticide, (5) lighting a cigarette and allowing it to smoulder, (6) no activities, and (7) using an exhaust or ventilation system. Furthermore, our method improves the detection accuracy by a support vector machine, compared to the classification without data filtering, and with feature extraction of PCA and LDA. Addressing outdoor air quality predication, we propose a novel spatial dataaided incremental support-vector regression (SaIncSVR). We overcome some of the problems associated with other prediction models. Existing models often demand data to be presented in a more convenient form than real data facilitates, for instance complete data, time-series complete, or a specified data capture process making them inadequate when used for environmental prediction. We conduct extensive experiments of PM 2 : 5 prediction over 13 monitoring stations in Auckland, New Zealand. The experimental results indicate that our SaIncSVR performs improved PM 2 : 5 prediction. Our method shows the capability to overcome missing data problems, an improvement over many other documented techniques. We compare our method with a local incremental support-vector regression. Further for PM 2 : 5 spatial prediction, we conduct experiments on outdoor air quality prediction using a data-driven Gaussian geometry model. This model shows promise on a limited number monitoring stations and warrants further investigations. We promote incremental data modelling, given its benefits in processing large amounts of data with parallelization capability in many dimensions, as a constructive solution to spatio-temporal computational environmental analysis. This research documents systematic and comprehensive research in the area of computational environmental analysis. For this study we investigated a variety {{of environmental problems}}, environmental data, change & emission source detection, pollution variation & distribution, and data modeling & prediction. The proposed computational methods could be useful for other environmental detection and prediction problems, especially those using large, asynchronous and spatial-temporal data...|$|E
