40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to investigate the combined effects of glass fibre reinforcement and molecular orientation in polypropylene-short glass fibre composites. Specimens have been fabricated using the injection moulding process and drawn using a small <b>die</b> <b>drawing</b> rig. The effects of <b>die</b> <b>drawing</b> on the fibre composites are complex, with the drawing process orienting both the polymer molecules and the glass fibres. This may be accompanied by the creation of voids in the polymer matrix and their destruction in the compressive stress field thus restoring the interfacial contact area between fibre and matrix. Unfilled and short glass fibre filled polypropylene specimens, with fibre content 7 % wt, 13 %wt, 27 %wt, and 55 %wt, were injection moulded prior to the <b>die</b> <b>drawing</b> process. An experimental program of <b>die</b> <b>drawing</b> within an oven at elevated temperature was conducted for polypropylene filled to various levels and at different strain rates. The specimens drew to draw ratios in the range ¿= 1. 41 to ¿= 5. 6. Mechanical characterization of the test materials has been conducted by examining the tensile stress strain and fracture behaviour under uniaxial conditions. The influence of glass fibre content and drawing conditions (draw ratio) on the fracture toughness and crack propagation was investigated using the double edge notched fracture test. The notch lengths ranged from 1. 5 to 2. 5 mm for 10 mm wide specimens. The critical stress intensity factor increased as the fibre content increased up to a limiting filler level. The fracture toughness of both unfilled and fibre filled polypropylene were found to be highly dependent on draw ratio. The results were analysed to find out the optimal draw ratio and fibre content that yielded the maximum modulus, strength and fracture toughness. Data showed that, at a given draw ratio, modulus, strength and fracture toughness increased with increasing fibre content to a maximum and then decreased. The optimum material was obtained at a draw ratio of 2. 5 and filler loading 13 wt%...|$|E

This is mainly due to the possibility to obtain a broad combination of hardness and toughness thus meeting the requirements concerning strength, crack resistance and wear resistance set by the wire drawing process. However, the increasing cost of cemented carbide in combination with the possibility to increase the wear resistance of steel through the deposition of wear resistant CVD and PVD coatings have enhanced the interest to replace cemented carbide <b>drawing</b> <b>dies</b> with CVD and PVD coated steel wire <b>drawing</b> <b>dies.</b> In the present study, the possibility to replace cemented carbide wire <b>drawing</b> <b>dies</b> with CVD and PVD coated steel <b>drawing</b> <b>dies</b> have been investigated by tribological characterisation, i. e. pin-on-disc and scratch testing, in combination with post-test observations of the tribo surfaces using scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and 3 D surface profilometry.

40|$|Local damage {{models are}} known to produce {{pathological}} mesh dependence in finite element simulations. The solution is to either use a regularization technique or to adopt a non-local damage model. Viscoplasticity is one technique which can regularize the mesh dependence of local damage model by incorporating a physical phenomenon in the constitutive model i. e. rate effects. A detailed numerical study of viscoplastic regularization is carried out in this work. Two case studies were considered i. e. a bar with shear loading and a sheet metal under tensile loading. The influence of hardening / softening parameters, prescribed deformation rate and mesh size on the regularization was studied. It {{was found that the}} primary viscoplastic length scale is a function of hardening and softening parameters but does not depend upon the deformation rate.
