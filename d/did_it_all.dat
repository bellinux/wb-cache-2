He {{was one of}} several star {{witnesses}} in the Becker-Rosenthal trial, among these being fellow gamblers Bridgie Webber, Harry Vallon, and Sam Schepps.

[...] In retrospect, it feels good, the video we have done much better suited to the track than the first ideas. [...] has an incredible track on everything she is doing.

Four of the music videos for the song were directed by Brett Leonard, with a fifth being credited to Howard Deutch. Each used stock footage shot by Idol and Leonard, filmed personally and edited on Idol's computer. Idol did so with the intention of sending a [...] "do-it-yourself" [...] message that mocked and rejected the standards of MTV music video creation. [...] "We <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> on camcorder and we sort of wanted to say {{you can make your own}} videos, and you don't always have to do it in a very MTV way."

500|$|In {{order to}} film the episode without {{exceeding}} the budget, director Rob Bowman used {{a combination of}} [...] "clever camera angles, strategic use of breakaway cement, and—in the case of Mulder's trunk lid—the miracle of auto-body repair substance Bondo".

He explained that, [...] "the first time we <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> <b>all</b> we got was a big square hole [...] but we didn't want it to look like Bugs Bunny with his ears sticking out, either".

[...] by English rock band Oasis, and went to describe it as [...] "a heart-rending tale of life {{at the top of}} the teen pop tree, transformed into an anthem for dramatic, moody 12-year-old girls everywhere by Max Martin's scary talent for teenybop lyrics." [...] However, it was noted that some of the lyrics [...] "sounds pretty heavy when you've just been dumped and Britney's Mickey Mouse Club-trained falsetto is reaching its peak." [...] David Veitch of Calgary Sun called [...] "Lucky" [...] a [...] "sweetly melodic mid-tempo song" [...] and regarding the lyrics commented, [...] "We feel her pain." [...] Billboard magazine contributor Chuck Taylor praised [...] "Lucky" [...] and featured the song on the Spolight column of his Singles Review section. Taylor stated that: [...] "its contagious melody, bang-in-your-brain hook, the empathetic theme of a girl who's the world biggest superstar and yet feels all alone (hmm...) will make it an easy sell to top 40 radio and to her grand legion of dedicated fans".|$|E
500|$|The autobiographical {{story begins}} as a brunette Gaga is taken through a clinic on a stretcher, while an inner {{monologue}} about her past memories is heard. The nurses wear Calvin Klein Collection uniforms and Giuseppe Zanotti shoes. A nurse awakens Gaga and checks her heart rate and blood pressure. The nurse then tells Gaga how beautiful she is and how she looked just like her mother when she delivered the former. Gaga then claims {{that her mother was}} a saint, before taking a cigarette out of her bag. The nurse, startled by this, quickly then takes the cigarette out of her mouth and puts it on a table. Gaga cries and tells the nurse that she will become a star. She asks the nurse to play music and the camera zooms out to show viewers several female patients treated and wandering off. A new scene shows Gaga practicing ballet dancing to piano music, and a following one shows her taken back from the hospital to her New York apartment by her best friend Bo. Ludwig van Beethoven's [...] "Piano Sonata No. 8" [...] plays. Gaga is undressed from an outfit designed by Stéphane Rolland and taken to bed, but is interrupted by a phone call that notifies her of being dropped from her record label. Frustrated, she makes a mess in her apartment, pours breakfast cereal on herself, and jumps in the bath with her heels on. The piano music ends and Gaga is seen bleaching her hair, bathing in a tub, and humming [...] "Marry the Night". The monologue continues as Gaga says, [...] "But I still had my bedazzler and I had a lot of patches, shiny ones from M Trimmings, so I wreaked havoc on some old denim. And I did what any girl would do—I <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> over again." [...] According to Jocelyn Vena of MTV News, Gaga resembles pop artist Madonna in the film Desperately Seeking Susan. Gaga's dancers look down at her from a mezzanine as the clock chimes.|$|E

2500|$|The Washington Post said: [...] "is forever {{struggling}} with words and emotions on her debut album The Divine Comedy, forever {{trying to make}} sense of love or the lack of it. She never succeeds, of course, but her tenacity is what makes the album worth hearing. Evoking a curious combination of childlike innocence, Harlequin romance and hippie sentimentality, her songs are tone poems of a sort, inspired by vulnerability and wariness, sung in a small, plaintive, unguarded soprano. At times she seems hopelessly lovesick, a prime candidate for any heartbreaker's ruse, but on [...] "You <b>Did</b> <b>It</b> <b>All</b> Before," [...] "Clock," [...] and [...] "Don't Fade Away" [...] she sounds a lot older and wiser, no stranger to hurt and disillusionment." ...|$|E

[...] To allow the band to create what Holder described as a [...] "really first class album", the band decided to take some time off from touring: [...] "We decided not to rush the album, like we have done on past recording sessions. We wanted to get everything just so. It wasn't just a 'wam bam' job. We had six weeks in the studio to get better and better, so the playing got better, and the sound got better, so yeah in terms of improvement it's a big step ahead. The sound and production is the best yet." ...|$|E

[...] Mark Kemp from Creative Loafing gave {{a positive}} review for her performance in Atlanta writing: [...] "Madonna has continued to grow, {{not just as a}} musical performer but as a musical stage actor, deconstructionist and reconstructionist. Her MDNA Tour is not a concert— it's a theater event, complete with concepts and routines that range from well-thought-out to somewhat abstruse. The singer is as committed as ever to making statements and being provocative— that's her stock-in-trade, after all— and her non-hit material is every bit as adventurous and challenging as any of her hits.
