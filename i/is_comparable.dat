5|$|A white dwarf, {{also called}} a {{degenerate}} dwarf, is a stellar core remnant composed mostly of electron-degenerate matter. A white dwarf is very dense: its mass <b>is</b> <b>comparable</b> {{to that of}} the Sun, while its volume <b>is</b> <b>comparable</b> to that of Earth. A white dwarf's faint luminosity comes from the emission of stored thermal energy; no fusion takes place in a white dwarf wherein mass is converted to energy. The nearest known white dwarf is Sirius B, at 8.6 light years, the smaller component of the Sirius binary star. There are currently thought to be eight white dwarfs among the hundred star systems nearest the Sun. The unusual faintness of white dwarfs was first recognized in 1910. The name white dwarf was coined by Willem Luyten in 1922.|$|E

50|$|When {{classifying}} mathematical objects (e.g., topological spaces), two {{criteria are}} said to <b>be</b> <b>comparable</b> when the objects that obey one criterion constitute {{a subset of the}} objects that obey the other, which is to say when they <b>are</b> <b>comparable</b> under the partial order ⊂. For example, the T1 and T2 criteria <b>are</b> <b>comparable,</b> while the T1 and sobriety criteria are not.|$|R
25|$|For light, {{the spatial}} {{terms in the}} {{invariant}} interval <b>are</b> <b>comparable</b> in magnitude to the temporal term, so {{the effects of the}} curvature of space <b>are</b> <b>comparable</b> to the effects of the curvature of time.|$|R
5|$|For example, rhenium diboride can be {{produced}} at ambient pressures, but is rather expensive because of rhenium.

30|$|The {{accuracy}} of the PROMIS and KOOS scales <b>were</b> <b>comparable.</b> Additionally, the CID for both minimal and moderate CID <b>were</b> <b>comparable</b> to other studies.

50|$|In mathematics, any two {{elements}} x and y {{of a set}} P that is partially ordered by a binary relation ≤ <b>are</b> <b>comparable</b> when either x ≤ y or y ≤ x. If {{it is not the}} case that x and y <b>are</b> <b>comparable,</b> then they <b>are</b> called incomparable.|$|R
5|$|A cheap, {{cost-effective}} {{and practical}} alternative in poorer countries is visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA). Instituting and sustaining cytology-based programs {{in these regions}} can be difficult, due {{to the need for}} trained personnel, equipment and facilities and difficulties in follow-up. With VIA, results and treatment can be available on the same day. As a screening test, VIA <b>is</b> <b>comparable</b> to cervical cytology in accurately identifying precancerous lesions.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the concept}} of chakra appears in the Indian mythology {{as well as in}} Buddhism and in some other belief systems, when asked in an interview, Kishimoto claimed that none of these {{influences}} were the basis for his use of the concept in Naruto. He further asserted that it was a term to apply a concrete definition to the ninjas' ability to use jutsu in the series and <b>is</b> <b>comparable</b> to the Force in Star Wars or to magic points in role-playing games.|$|E
5|$|Although xenon has {{potential}} {{for use in}} computed tomography (CT) to assess regional ventilation, its anesthetic properties limit its fraction in the breathing gas to 35%. A breathing mixture of 30% xenon and 30% krypton <b>is</b> <b>comparable</b> in effectiveness for CT to a 40% xenon fraction, while avoiding the unwanted effects of a high partial pressure of xenon gas.|$|E
5|$|Chaucer's Criseyde is {{swayed by}} Diomedes playing on her fear. Pandarus is now her uncle, more worldly-wise and {{more active in}} what happens and so Troilus is more passive. This {{passivity}} is given comic treatment when Troilus passes out in Criseyde's bedroom and is lifted into her bed by Pandarus. Troilus' repeated emotional paralysis <b>is</b> <b>comparable</b> to that of Hamlet {{who may have been}} based on him. It can be seen as driven by loyalty both to Criseyde and to his homeland, but has also been interpreted less kindly.|$|E

M.granulifera differs in forming a whitish, wrinkled cap and club-shaped to roughly spindle-shaped pleurocystidia. Mycena nidificata also bears some {{resemblance to the}} European species M.flos-nivium, which is distinguished by having cylindrical, amyloid spores, gills without veins between them, and an absence of cord-like rhizomorphs.|$|E
