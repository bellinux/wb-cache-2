5|$|A {{week later}} Kujau met Jäckel and Alex Kuhn in {{connection}} with the poems he had forged and sold to Stiefel. These <b>had</b> <b>been</b> published by Jäckel and Kuhn in 1980, but one historian pointed out that one of the poems could not have been produced by Hitler as it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> written by the poet Herybert Menzel. Jäckel was concerned that the poem in question <b>had</b> <b>been</b> accompanied by a letter on Nazi party stationery guaranteeing it as a genuine work by Hitler. Many of the other pieces in Stiefel's collection were similarly verified, so doubts began to surface over these, too. Kujau claimed ignorance, saying he was only the middleman, but told them that Heidemann, a reputed journalist, had seen the crash site from which the papers originated; Jäckel advised Stiefel to have his collection forensically examined, and passed 26 suspect poems to the Hamburg district attorney for investigation. Gruner + Jahr also knew about the problems with the poems, and that the source <b>had</b> <b>been</b> Kujau, but he assured them that this source <b>had</b> <b>been</b> elsewhere in East Germany, unconnected to the diaries, and they continued with their deal.|$|E

5|$|According to Nick Davies in The Guardian, the {{statement}} {{was the result of}} an intense argument in the Met's press office, after an earlier draft <b>had</b> <b>been</b> rejected.

Davies asked why the IPCC were involved if they had not realized there <b>had</b> <b>been</b> police contact. He alleged that senior sources within the Met said privately that the assault on Tomlinson <b>had</b> <b>been</b> spotted by the police control room at Cobalt Street in south London, and that a chief inspector on the ground had also reported it. The Met issued a statement saying they had checked with every chief inspector who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> part of Operation Glencoe, and that none of them had called in such a report.|$|E
