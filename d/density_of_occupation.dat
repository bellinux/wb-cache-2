50|$|Recent {{excavations}} in December 2015 by Cambodian {{and international}} teams near Prasat Thom and the Rahal {{in the ancient}} urban core area of Koh Ker have yielded radiocarbon dates that clearly place significant habitation and activity beginning {{as early as the}} 7th-8th centuries CE - often noted as the Chenla period by historians. Some pottery types may date to the earlier Funan period. Over 24,000 artifacts and ecofacts were recovered from three test sites. Artifacts are mostly pottery fragments with local and exotic types representing over 1000 years of site use throughout the occupational sequence. Exotic pottery types include Chinese stoneware and glazed ware from the Song Yuan periods. Other exotic pottery include Thai and Vietnamese stoneware that generally date to the late Angkor and post-Angkor periods. Possible Persian pottery dating to the 9th century has been noted as well. Thus, Koh Ker has been linked to long distance value chains for considerable time spans. Although the area may have been significantly repurposed during the 10th century construction-boom heyday of Jayavarman IV, site use and activity continued well beyond the 10th century. Intensity of activities and <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> may have oscillated over time in relation to political and socio-economic factors. Natural and human resource management variables as well as environmental phenomena may have also played significant roles related to changes in popularity, population and productivity.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present {{research}} which analysed energy consumption in the Melbourne central business district (CBD) office stock and examined all buildings to identify CO 2 emissions in 2005. The rationale was that, by profiling a large group of buildings, it would be possible to identify characteristics of the stock. For example, do older buildings typically emit more CO 2 per square metre than newer buildings? Design/methodology/approach – This research conducted a detailed analysis of all Melbourne CBD office stock to identify which patterns and trends emerged regarding building characteristics and carbon emissions. The study examined variables such as building size, number of employees, occupancy levels, physical characteristics and building age. Findings – By examining all office stock and aggregating data, the results confirm that it is possible to identify general physical building characteristics and carbon emissions. This research confirmed that clear relationships existed within the Melbourne CBD office stock in terms of building size, age and the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> in relation to CO 2 emissions.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{evaluates the}} applicability of three models that purport to describe and predict the development and establishment of social complexity based on the interplay between environmental setting and human communities. The three models are juxtaposed {{in terms of the}} conditions required to foment the development of and formalization of social complexity and the corresponding level of inequality, so that each model requires contrasting environmental risk conditions relative to the other two. Considering the relative dearth of archaeological studies focused on understanding the development of social complexity in Nicaragua, and the abundance of readily accessible precolumbian ceramics and lithics available on soil surfaces, a full coverage, surface survey (172 km 2) was conducted in the municipalities of Tisma and Ticuantepe in the vicinity of Masaya, Nicaragua in order to obtain the data necessary to test the suitability of each model. Relative synchronic and diachronic changes, including the tempo and pace were documented using the established and broadly accepted ceramic chronology, including the distribution over the municipal territories and the <b>densities</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> within each defined community. The results indicate very distinctive patterns for each region over an occupation sequence lasting at least two millennia.

Demographic, sociological and environmental data were collected by face-to-face interviews using a standard questionnaire. Infection with Helicobacter pylori was assessed by detection of anti-H. pylori IgG serum antibodies. The prevalence of H. pylori antibodies was 75. 4 % in the urban population and 72. 3 % in rural (village) residents (p 0. 459). No association was found between infection and age, gender, education level, size of household, economic activity or source of drinking water. The infection rate was higher in children whose parents were both infected, and also in children whose mother was infected (p < 0. 001). By logistic regression analysis, the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> of sleeping accommodation (more than three persons sharing a room; 95 % odds ratio (OR) = 9. 82 (4. 13 – 23. 31), p < 0. 001), and the mother's status within the household (95 % OR = 3. 85 (1. 53 – 9. 67), p 0. 003), were independent predictors for H. pylori infection.

40|$|International audienceThe {{mechanisms}} {{responsible for}} the emergence of a farming economy in Transcaucasia have been thesubject of much debate since the 1970 's. This debate has focused particularly on the role played by Near-Eastern influences {{in the development of the}} Shulaveri-Shomu culture, which emerged in the Kura Basinat the end of the 7 th millennium BC. Recently, archaeological investigations have been conducted by aGeorgian-French team in Gadachrili Gora, one of four “Shulaveri group” tells located on a tributary of theChrami River in the Kvemo-Kartli plain of Georgia. Dating evidence clearly places the first levels of thistell in an early phase of the development of the culture, between 5920 and 5720 Cal BC. These investigationsprovide new evidence regarding the processes of neolithisation, especially in terms ofsettlement organisation and the architectural techniques used at the time. Several occupation levelsfeature connected circular units, of various sizes, together with “courtyards”, which were used as circulatione or waste disposal areas. The density and organisation of these structures display differentpatterns for the two distinct levels of occupation preserved. Evidence from the deepest occupation levelssuggests a high <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> in the settlement, with complex episodes of destruction andrebuilding. Several building techniques were used, including different types of bricks laid in variouspatterns depending on wall types. In addition, there is evidence for the use of the “bauge” constructiontechnique, which was unknown in the region until now. Parallels established with the constructiontechniques of Northern Iran and Mesopotamia contribute to the discussion regarding the processesunderlying the emergence of the Shulaveri culture. Moreover, the high number of storage structures andthe discovery of organized built spaces dedicated to storage raise many questions about the status of thesite, the organisation of agricultural practices, and the relationship of these populations to the hydrographicnetwork within the area...|$|E

The shift embodied in the virtual approach to startups calls for a new architectural institution that accommodates and facilitates this model. We need a physical place to operate, iterate, and test projects with the public. This thesis proposes just that: A startup incubator with a public interface for New Orleans, a city rich in social, artistic, and entrepreneurial ambition. Traditionally, innovation is done in isolation: the public only connects with a product when it’s already on the market, separated from its creators. But an institution that engages customer and product development simultaneously would limit failed introductions to the market. This requires consolidating the places of product innovation and public introduction. The garage is a compelling space of innovation because when its primary occupant - the car - is out, its space is up for grabs by the occupant of the house - the innovator. Open the garage door, and the space welcomes the public. Transforming the diagram of the garage to accommodate an institution, fluctuations in rights to the space of the incubator indulge oscillations in populations and access. A core system of storage elevators allows users to easily store their collapsible office. Clearing the floor in their absence, the space can be used by others and the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> increased. Activating the elevator system to vertically relocate “offices,” users engage environments with amenities appropriate to their current ambitions, while mediating levels accessible to the public or not. As tourists overflow the streets and enter the institution, they engage the whims of the creative process, providing innovators with vital feedback in return. Creativity joins the collective...|$|E
40|$|Havana, Cuba's {{capital city}} had its {{beginnings}} {{with the construction}} of the San Cristobal de la Habana village, which was consolidated from a city with a large urban development from architectural SXVI until today. The urban structure that will characterize the city is given by a system of square with different uses and functions which will develop the core business of the town, giving polycentric character. During its growth this character always prevailed and remains in the current city allowing the decentralization of functions. The presence of outstanding works of domestic architecture, with large central courtyard mansions and hallway with colorful stained glass, were symbols of economic development. Religious architecture, boomed equally important for the construction of buildings part of the skyline as milestones and the social life. The Church as an institution takes force within society itself to develop health functions, including education, thus exerting ideological control - cultural on different social groups. Today that village, Old Havana has experienced significant economic, cultural and social product integrated management model implemented. The of Historian´s of the city Office (Oficina del Historiador de la Ciudad) and its directorates, has rescued {{an important part of the}} tangible and intangible heritage sample of Cuban culture in the oldest part of Havana, the historic center. The work of the Historians of the city office, with offices established directorates to carry out comprehensive management process, with a comprehensive development strategy developed and self-funded, achieving significant economic development to enhance their traditional components. The integrated management model of the old town, sees culture as main linchpin of development, and the human being the heart of the process. It's a livable historic center, where a high <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupation,</b> a considerable number of families, thus making the man as principal by and for implementing this model of development. Defines whole relationship between elements social and cultural - together with a diverse cultural tourism and commercial activity. The social work undertaken in Old Havana has been to highlight the launch of educations programs, public health, and the housing sector and promotes the recognition of the wide range of historical, architectural, urban, and others that make the Historical Center of Old Havana and generally a place with exceptional heritage features...|$|E
40|$|Developing {{countries}} have been experiencing an accelerated urban growth {{with high levels of}} informal housing (houses that do not comply with property rights regime and urban regulations). This trend has brought renewed attention to the study of developing cities in general, and of the informal housing sector in particular. This study examines the relationship between land use regulation, housing price, and informality, in the metropolitan area of Curitiba, Brazil. Using a simultaneous equation model, the study conducts a regression analysis to understand the magnitude of the effect of urban regulation on formal housing price and the effect of rising formal housing price on the quantity of informal housing. Three hypotheses are tested: (a) more restrictive land use regulation increases housing price in the formal housing market; (b) an increase in formal housing price causes the quantity of informal housing to rise; and (c) an increase in formal housing price in one geographic area causes the quantity of informal housing to rise in neighboring areas. The study shows that for three regulatory variables - minimum plot area, minimum front setback and minimum frontage - land use regulations that limit the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> have a significant positive effect on price. Regulatory variables that affect building height - maximum number of floors and floor-to-area ratio - have the opposite effect, possibly because single and multifamily units are not being analyzed separately. The study finds that the price of formal housing has a negative effect on the quantity of informal housing in the same location, but this effect turns positive in the adjacent and more distant locations. As expected, the rise in formal housing price in one locality pushes people to the informal sector in more distant neighborhoods. However, in the same locality, a rise in price decreases the quantity of informal housing. The results indicate that high priced areas act as a bar {{to the development of the}} informal sector in the same locality (explaining the negative coefficients of formal housing price) while the informal sector is being pushed to the outskirts of the city (explaining why the lagged price variables become positive and have an increasing effect on the quantity of informal housing as the locations move further away from each other) ...|$|E

40|$|Disorder or {{sufficiently}} strong interactions can {{render a}} metallic state unstable, {{causing it to}} turn into an insulating one. Despite {{the fact that the}} interplay of these two routes to a vanishing conductivity has been a central research topic, a unifying picture has not emerged so far. Here, we establish that the two dimensional Falicov-Kimball model, one of the simplest lattice models of strong electron correlation, does allow for the study of this interplay. In particular, we show that this model at particle-hole symmetry possesses three distinct thermodynamic insulating phases and exhibits Anderson localization. The previously reported metallic phase is identified as a finite-size feature due to the presence of weak localization. We characterize these phases by their electronic <b>density</b> <b>of</b> states, staggered <b>occupation,</b> conductivity, and the generalized inverse participation ratio. The implications of our findings for other strongly correlated systems are discussed...|$|R
40|$|We present {{analytical}} and numerical investigation of spectral and transport properties of a quadruple quantum-dot (QQD) structure {{which is one}} of the popular low-dimensional systems in the context of fundamental quantum physics study, future electronic applications and quantum calculations. The <b>density</b> <b>of</b> states, <b>occupation</b> numbers and conductance of the structure were analyzed using the nonequilibrium Green's functions in the tight binding approach and the equation-of-motion method. In particular the anisotropy of hopping integrals and on-site electron energies as well as the effects of the finite intra- and interdot Coulomb interactions were investigated. It was found out that the anisotropy of the kinetic processes in the system leads to the Fano-Feshbach asymmetrical peak. We demonstrated that the conductance of QQD device has a wide insulating band with steep edges separating triple-peak structures if the intradot Coulomb interactions are taken into account. The interdot Coulomb correlations between the central QDs result in the broadening of this band and the occurrence of an additional band with low conductance due to the Fano antiresonances. It was shown that in this case the conductance of the anisotropic QQD device can be dramatically changed by tuning the anisotropy of on-site electron energies. Comment: 21 pages, 25 figure...|$|R
