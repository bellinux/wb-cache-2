40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to reclaim and recover palm oil mill {{effluent}} (POME) for water reuse using tubular ultrafiltration (UF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. The reclaimed water was compared with the <b>final</b> <b>discharged</b> water of the local mill. The raw POME was first subjected to a physical pre-treatment process to remove the content of organic matter and suspended solids. The pre-treatment process was coupled with membrane technology (UF and RO) to reclaim the clean water from POME. From the combined techniques of UF (5 bar) and RO (30 bar) the results showed that the turbidity and BOD 5 were reduced by 99 % and 98. 9 %, respectively. Compared to the <b>final</b> <b>discharged</b> POME, this suggested method gives a significant difference in BOD 5 and turbidity. The final permeate of RO was found to comply with the standards for water reuse. Therefore, the combined UF and RO method is a viable alternative and has a great potential for use in the palm oil industry...|$|R

60|$|The gentleman to {{whom this}} {{enormous}} greeting was addressed, of whom {{we shall have}} more {{to say in the}} sequel, had been in arms for the exiled family of Stuart in the year 1715, and was made prisoner at Preston in Lancashire. He was of a very ancient family, and somewhat embarrassed fortune; a scholar, according to the scholarship of Scotchmen, that is, his learning was more diffuse than accurate, and he was rather a reader than a grammarian. Of his zeal for the classic authors he is said to have given an uncommon instance. On the road between Preston and London, he made his escape from his guards; but being afterwards found loitering near the place where they had lodged the former night, he was recognised, and again arrested. His companions, and even his escort, were surprised at his infatuation, and could not help inquiring, why, being once at liberty, he had not made the best of his way to a place of safety; to which he replied, that he had intended to do so, but, in good faith, he had returned to seek his Titus Livius, which he had forgot in the hurry of his escape. [Footnote: See Note 3.] The simplicity of this anecdote struck the gentleman, who, as we before observed, had managed the defence of some of those unfortunate persons, at the expense of Sir Everard, and perhaps some others of the party. He was, besides, himself a special admirer of the old Patavinian, and though probably his own zeal might not have carried him such extravagant lengths, even to recover the edition of Sweynheim and Pannartz (supposed to be the princeps), he did not the less estimate the devotion of the North Briton, and in consequence exerted himself to so much purpose to remove and soften evidence, detect legal flaws, et cetera, that he accomplished the <b>final</b> <b>discharge</b> and deliverance of Cosmo Comyne Bradwardine from certain very awkward consequences of a plea before our sovereign lord the king in Westminster.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: By using a {{triangular}} symmetric signal the total electric charge that flows through a dielectric is accurately determined. The charge {{stored in the}} dielectric is determined by combining the Thermally Stimulated Space Charge Current measurement and the Isothermal <b>Final</b> <b>Discharging</b> Current measurement. For the first time, {{the relation between the}} two charges for different forming temperatures, times, fields and triangular voltage slope is analyzed. If the charge that flows through the circuit is low, the released charge from the sample is close with it. The result is that the conduction current contributes mainly to space charge accumulation in the dielectric. This result can be understood accepting that the charge transport mechanism is mainly determined by hopping between localized states at Fermi level. No potential barrier at metal-dielectric contact, even for lowest applied fields, was observed in our experiments. For specimen characterization the sample dynamic resistance is introduced and used. From the measured current the sample dynamic resistance and dielectric constant are determined. They are dependent on the amount of stored charge in the specimen...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT – The {{isothermal}} and the non-isothermal current {{released from}} a polarized/charged dielectric material is analyzed. The measured current {{is determined by the}} polarization charge and space charge and the main concern is dedicated to the situation when the process of the space charge de-trapping represents the main source of the measured current. The experimental measurements have been carried out on polyethylene terephthalate but the reported results are typical for a large class of materials. Isothermal discharging current and voltage, isothermal <b>final</b> <b>discharging</b> current experiments, for samples polarized/charged at constant current or constant voltage, have been carried out. At the same time thermally stimulated discharge current and thermally stimulated space charge current for samples charged/polarized at constant currents or constant fields, in fore or high vacuum, and on partially or well-conditioned specimens have been carried out. The currents determined by the homocharge and the heterocharge have the same polarity, no matter how high the polarization field was. For a partially conditioned sample the shape and the polarity of the thermally stimulated discharge current peaks are strongly dependent about the conditioning process. No current polarity change was observed for a well-conditioned sample. Charge layers of different polarity can coexist into the sample accounting for the current polarity change...|$|R
