The flare tower and several vent gas scrubbers had been out of service for five months before the disaster. Only one <b>gas</b> <b>scrubber</b> was operating: it could not treat such a large amount of MIC with sodium hydroxide (caustic soda), which would have brought the concentration down to a safe level.

To reduce energy costs, the refrigeration system was idle. The MIC was kept at 20 degrees Celsius, not the 4.5 degrees advised by the manual. Even the steam boiler, intended to clean the pipes, was non-operational for unknown reasons. Slip-blind plates that would have prevented water from pipes being cleaned from leaking into the MIC tanks, had the valves been faulty, were not installed and their installation had been omitted from the cleaning checklist. As MIC is water-soluble, deluge guns were in place to contain escaping gases from the stack. The water pressure was too weak for the guns to spray high enough to reach the gas which would have reduced the concentration of escaping gas significantly. In addition to it, carbon steel valves were used at the factory, even though they were known to corrode when exposed to acid.|$|E

5000|$|Scrubber systems (aka Chemical Scrubbers, Gas Scrubbers) are {{a diverse}} group of air {{pollution}} control devices {{that can be used to}} remove some particulates and/or gases from industrial exhaust streams. The first air scrubber was designed to remove carbon dioxide from the air of an early submarine, the Ictineo I, a role for which they continue to be used till today. Traditionally, the term [...] "scrubber" [...] has referred to pollution control devices that use liquid to wash unwanted pollutants from a gas stream. Recently, the term has also been used to describe systems that inject a dry reagent or slurry into a dirty exhaust stream to [...] "wash out" [...] acid <b>gases.</b> <b>Scrubbers</b> are one of the primary devices that control gaseous emissions, especially acid <b>gases.</b> <b>Scrubbers</b> can also be used for heat recovery from hot gases by flue-gas condensation.

40|$|A new {{concentration}} {{technique for}} the extraction and enrichment of water-soluble atmospheric trace gases has been developed. The gas scrubbing technique efficiently extracts soluble gases {{from a large}} volume flow rate of air sample into a small volume of refluxed trapping solution. The <b>gas</b> <b>scrubber</b> utilizes a small nebulizing nozzle that mixes the incoming air with an aqueous extracting solution to form an air/droplet mist. The mist provides excellent interfacial surface areas for mass transfer. The resulting mist sprays upward through the reaction chamber until it impinges upon a hydrophobic membrane that virtually blocks the passage of droplets but offers little resistance to the existing gas flow. Droplets containing the scrubbed gases coalesce on the membrane and drip back into the reservoir for further refluxing. After a suitable concentration period, the extracting solution containing the analyte can be withdrawn for analysis. The nebulization-reflex concentration technique is more efficient (maximum flow of gas through the minimum volume of extractant) than conventional bubbler/impinger gas extraction techniques and is offered as an alternative method...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} paper, {{treatment}} of gasification power plant effluent from <b>gas</b> <b>scrubber</b> {{was carried out}} using micro-porous alumina membrane tubes consisting of different channels (1 and 7) under simulated process conditions of temperature (45 ‚Äì 55 ¬∞C) and at varying transmembrane pressure drop (0. 2 ‚Äì 2 bar). The effect of membrane geometry on the membrane separation characteristics and fouling behavior was studied. The experimental {{results show that the}} flux decreases significantly (~ 40 %) during the first few minutes (10 min) of filtration which then stabilized with time. This behavior {{can be attributed to the}} classical dependence of flux on the time in microfiltration, which shows development of a relatively important fouling layer on the membrane surface. The characteristics of the effluent after filtration showed significant decrease in turbidity (95 %), COD (50 %), total dissolved solids (10 %), and total solids (55 %). The total suspended solids are reduced by almost 100 % and the pH remained unchanged (in the field of neutrality) during the process. The effect of various resistances that are acting in series was calculated using Darcy‚Äôs Law. These experimental results indicated that different filtration laws could be applied simultaneously for the description of the filtration data, which were found during cross-flow microfiltration of gasification power plant effluent...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Optimal {{operation}} of a <b>gas</b> absorption column (<b>scrubber)</b> is based upon a favorable combination of operating conditions that will achieve the greatest reduction in contaminant removal at the lowest cost, while satisfying environmental regulations. Fine tuning and optimization of <b>gas</b> <b>scrubbers</b> are usually accomplished by operating personnel in the field once the equipment has been designed, constructed, and installed. Industrial supervisors do not encourage operating personnel to experiment with column operation by varying ranges of operating parameters. Inappropriate changes could cause upset conditions {{that might lead to}} release of contaminated gas streams and result in a violation of an approved environmental air permit. A simple introduction to use of the Evolutionary Operation (EVOP) statistical method is provided to demonstrate how it {{can be applied to the}} optimization of an air pollution scrubber. This exercise was organized to be used in an undergraduate chemical engineering laboratory. The aim of this work is not to specifically identify the overall optimum set of operating conditions for maximizing scrubber performance, but to demonstrate use of the EVOP method.
