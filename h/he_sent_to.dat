5|$|Crawford wanted {{additional}} work, {{and approached}} Loews Theaters publicist Nils Granlund. Granlund secured a position for her with singer Harry Richman's act {{and arranged for}} her to do a screen test which <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> producer Harry Rapf in Hollywood. Stories have persisted that Crawford further supplemented her income by appearing in one or more stag, or soft-core pornographic, films, although this has been disputed.|$|E
5|$|Mark Livolsi realized, as McKenna had on {{the other}} end, that the film worked best when it focused on the Andrea-Miranda storyline. Accordingly, he cut a number of {{primarily}} transitional scenes, such as Andrea's job interview and the Runway staff's trip to Holt's studio. He also took out a scene early on where Miranda complimented Andrea. Upon reviewing them for the DVD, Frankel admitted he hadn't even seen them before, since Livolsi didn't include them in any prints <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> the director.|$|E
5|$|Sternberg {{sent some}} of his own {{specimens}} to German paleontologist Ferdinand Broili at Munich University, although Broili was not as prolific as Cope when it came to describing specimens. Cope's rival Othniel Charles Marsh also collected some bones of Dimetrodon, which <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> the Walker Museum. The first use of the name Dimetrodon came in 1878 when Cope named the species Dimetrodon incisivus, Dimetrodon rectiformis, and Dimetrodon gigas in the scientific journal Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society.|$|E
50|$|In 1903, <b>he</b> was <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Fort Riley and {{commanded}} the 19th Battery of the Field Artillery. Later that year, <b>he</b> was <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Washington, D.C. and {{served on the}} newly created General Staff.|$|R
50|$|In July 2010, <b>he</b> was <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Serie A side Bari in {{temporary}} deal for €300,000, with option to co-own the player for €1.5 million. Then in January 2011 <b>he</b> was <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Serie B side Livorno.|$|R
50|$|He and Adjutant Kathleen Bristow {{were married}} in 1929. In 1946, <b>he</b> was <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> serve in Australia South as Chief Secretary. <b>He</b> was <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Sweden to serve as Territorial Commander in 1948. In 1951, he became British Commissioner.|$|R
5|$|Alexios had {{anticipated}} {{help in the}} form of mercenary forces from the West, and was totally unprepared for the immense and undisciplined hosts which soon arrived, to his consternation and embarrassment. The first group, under Peter the Hermit, <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Asia Minor, ordering them to stay close to the coast and await reinforcements. However, the unruly crusaders refused to listen and began looting and pillaging the local Christian inhabitants. As they marched on Nicaea in 1096, they were caught by the Turks and massacred almost to the man.|$|E
5|$|During {{his stay}} in Hokkaido, Clark {{examined}} the local flora and introduced {{new species of}} plants and trees from Japan to the United States. <b>He</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Massachusetts a large assortment of seeds, many of which proved of special value to his own state, {{on account of the}} high latitude from which they were selected. In Teine-ku, Sapporo, he discovered a new lichen on the side of Mt. Teine, at an elevation of , which was named Cetraria clarkii, in his honor, by Edward Tuckerman.|$|E
5|$|He {{continued}} {{writing and}} eventually put together his first play, Removing All Doubt, which <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> his old Syracuse theatre teacher, Arthur Storch, who was impressed. In 1984, Removing All Doubt was staged for drama students at his alma mater, Syracuse University. After that, he wrote Hidden in This Picture which debuted off-off-Broadway at Steve Olsen's West Bank Cafe Downstairs Theatre Bar in New York City in 1988. The {{contents of his}} first two plays got him a theatrical agent. Producer John A. McQuiggan saw the production of Hidden in This Picture and commissioned Sorkin to turn the one-act into a full-length play called Making Movies.|$|E
50|$|In early 1815 <b>he</b> was <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> the Army of the North, {{and participated}} in the Battle of Sipe Sipe. <b>He</b> was <b>sent</b> back <b>to</b> Buenos Aires, where he was {{commissioned}} instructor of black soldiers.|$|R
50|$|Hoppe was {{captured}} by the British in April 1946 in Holstein. <b>He</b> was <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Camp 165 in Watten, Scotland in August 1947 until January 1948 when <b>he</b> was <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> an internment camp in Fallingbostel {{which was in the}} British zone of occupation in West Germany.|$|R
50|$|In 1953, <b>he</b> was <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Kiev to {{continue}} studies in espionage. In 1954, <b>he</b> was <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> East Germany {{under the name}} Josef Lehmann where he perfected his knowledge of German. In 1956, he often traveled to Munich where he began to perfect his false identity.|$|R
5|$|Manstein {{did nothing}} to prevent the killing of Jews and other civilians in the areas where his units were operating, and in which his Eleventh Army {{actively}} participated. That Manstein {{was well aware of}} the Einsatzgruppen massacres is demonstrated by a 1941 letter <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Otto Ohlendorf, in which Manstein demands Ohlendorf hand over the wristwatches of murdered Jews. Manstein felt his men deserved the watches, since they were doing so much to help Ohlendorf's men with their work. Smelser and Davies note that this letter was the only time that Manstein ever complained about the activities of the Einsatzgruppen. Manstein later stated that he felt the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust was exaggerated.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Mendizabal {{had retreated}} to the Portuguese border after sending two battalions to {{reinforce}} the garrison at Badajoz. Weakened by the defeat at Olivenza and by Ballesteros' continued absence, <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> La Romana for reinforcements, receiving on 14 January 1,800 men sent from Abrantes {{under the command of}} Carlos de España. Additionally, about 6,000 troops were sent forward from the Lines of Torres Vedras on 19 January, arriving at Elvas ten days later. When these forces joined with Mendizabal's remaining 3,000 men, a Spanish cavalry division and a brigade of Portuguese horse, the Allies had an army almost 15,000 strong—intended to be under the command of La Romana—with which to hold Soult in check. La Romana, however, died of an aneurysm on 23 January, and command of the army then fell to Mendizabal.|$|E
5|$|Wilfrid was an {{advocate}} {{for the use of}} music in ecclesiastical ceremonies. <b>He</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Kent for a singing master to instruct his clergy in the Roman style of church music, which involved a double choir who sang in antiphons and responses. Bede says that this singing master was named Æddi (or Eddius in Latin) and had the surname Stephen. Traditionally historians have identified Æddi as Stephen of Ripon, author of the Vita Sancti Wilfrithi, which has led to the assumption that the Vita was based on the recollections of one of Wilfrid's long-time companions. However, recent scholarship has come to believe that the Vita was not authored by the singing master, but by someone who joined Wilfrid {{in the last years of}} Wilfrid's life, not a close companion.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>sent</b> {{embassies}} <b>to</b> China from 1325 to 1328.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>sent</b> {{embassies}} <b>to</b> China from 1370 to 1381.|$|R
50|$|From 1960 <b>to</b> 1962 <b>he</b> was <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Rome to {{complete}} his studies in theology and get his bachelor's degree. He was ordained a priest in 1961. From 1962 <b>to</b> 1964, <b>he</b> was <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> the Higher Institute for Liturgy in Paris, while teaching at the major seminary in Châlons-en-Champagne.|$|R
5|$|C.T. Rogerson {{was born}} on October 2, 1918, in Ogden, Utah, to parents Elijah Knapp Rogerson (1899–1956) and Mable Crissie Clarke Rogerson (1897–1987). Upon {{graduating from high school}} in 1936, he {{enrolled}} in Weber Junior College (since renamed to Weber State University) for the following two years. Rogerson then attended Utah State University, where he had hoped to work under the supervision of botanist Bassett Maguire, but settled instead for the only available studentship with plant pathologist B.L. Richards. Rogerson received his bachelor of science from Utah State University in 1940. Soon after, he was drafted into the army, and spent three years (1942–1945) in the Pacific Theater of World War II. He served as a technical sergeant in laboratory and pharmacy at an army evacuation hospital, and cared for internees released in the Philippines near the war's end. During his war years, Rogerson made collections of plants, fungi, slime molds, and butterflies that <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Cornell or to the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
5|$|Dušan was {{succeeded by}} his 19-year-old son Uroš, who {{apparently}} regarded Marko Mrnjavčević {{as a man}} of trust. The new Emperor appointed him the head of the embassy <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Ragusa (now Dubrovnik, Croatia) at the end of July 1361 to negotiate peace between the empire and the Ragusan Republic after hostilities earlier that year. Although peace was not reached, Marko successfully negotiated the release of Serbian merchants from Prizren who were detained by the Ragusans and was permitted to withdraw silver deposited in the city by his family. The account of that embassy in a Ragusan document contains the earliest-known, undisputed reference to Marko Mrnjavčević. An inscription written in 1356 on a wall of a church in the Macedonian region of Tikveš, mentions a Nikola and a Marko as governors in that region, but the identity of this Marko is disputed.|$|E
5|$|Eusebius characterizes Urbanus {{as a man}} {{who enjoyed}} some variety in his punishments. One day, shortly after Easter 307, he ordered the virgin Theodosia from Tyre (Ṣūr, Lebanon) thrown to the sea for conversing with Christians {{attending}} trial and refusing sacrifice; the Christians in court, meanwhile, <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Phaeno. On a single day, November 2, 307, Urbanus sentenced a man named Domninus to be burned alive, three youths to fight as gladiators, and a priest to be exposed to a beast. On the same day, he ordered some young men to be castrated, sent three virgins to brothels, and imprisoned a number of others, including Pamphilus of Caesarea, a priest, scholar, and defender of the theologian Origen. Soon after, and for unknown reasons, Urbanus was stripped of his rank, imprisoned, tried, and executed, all in one day of expedited proceedings. His replacement, Firmilianus, was a veteran soldier and one of Maximinus's trusted confidants.|$|E
50|$|In 1977, <b>he</b> was <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Rome for his licenciate in Canon Law {{which he}} {{completed}} in 1979. In 1988, <b>he</b> was <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Rome again and obtained his doctorate in Canon Law from the Urban University. On {{his return to}} Pakistan he taught at Christ the King Seminary.|$|R
50|$|In July 2009, <b>he</b> was <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> {{the second}} team.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> was <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Sialkot in 1890 for {{settlement}} training.|$|R
5|$|Manuel {{had proven}} {{himself to be}} an {{energetic}} emperor who saw possibilities everywhere, and whose optimistic outlook had shaped his approach to foreign policy. However, {{in spite of his}} military prowess Manuel achieved but a slight degree of his object of restoring the Byzantine Empire. Retrospectively, some commentators have criticised some of Manuel's aims as unrealistic, in particular citing the expeditions <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Egypt as proof of dreams of grandeur on an unattainable scale. His greatest military campaign, his grand expedition against the Turkish Sultanate of Iconium, ended in humiliating defeat, and his greatest diplomatic effort apparently collapsed, when Pope Alexander III became reconciled to the German emperor Frederick Barbarossa at the Peace of Venice. Historian Mark C. Bartusis argues that Manuel (and his father as well) tried to rebuild a national army, but his reforms were adequate for neither his ambitions nor his needs; the defeat at Myriokephalon underscored the fundamental weakness of his policies. According to Edward Gibbon, Manuel's victories were not productive of any permanent or useful conquest.|$|E
5|$|Peng enlisted as {{a private}} second class, with a monthly wage of 5.5 yuan, 2 yuan of which he sent back to support his family. Within seven months he was {{promoted}} to private first class, with a monthly wage of 6 yuan, 3 yuan of which <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> his family. One of Peng's commanding officers was an idealistic Nationalist who had participated in the 1911 Xinhai Revolution, who influenced Peng to sympathize with the Kuomintang goals of social reform and national reunification. When another civil war broke out in 1917, Peng's regiment split from the rest of its army and joined the forces of Tang Shengzhi, who was aligned with Tan Yankai and Sun Yat-sen, against those aligned with the northern warlord Wu Peifu. During this period Peng received training in formal tactics from an officer in his brigade. In July 1918 Peng was captured while on a reconnaissance mission behind enemy lines, but was released after two weeks. In April 1919 Peng was promoted to master sergeant and acting platoon commander. Tang Shengzhi's forces drove enemy troops out of Hunan in July 1920, capturing the provincial capital of Changsha.|$|E
5|$|Rowley's {{force had}} also been active: Nereide under Captain Robert Corbet {{captured}} {{a number of small}} vessels off Port Napoleon in the late spring, including the brig Aigle, which <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> the Cape of Good Hope with a prize crew that mutinied, killed their officer and took the ship to Île Bonaparte. The brig HMS Otter, under Captain Nesbit Willoughby, raided an anchorage at Rivière Noire District on 14 August, capturing a coastal vessel (which he later had to abandon) under heavy fire. Willoughby also recaptured Aigle shortly afterwards. Rowley himself had chased the Bellone in Raisonnable as the French ship emerged from Port Napoleon on 17 August, but had been unable to catch her. Most significant of all was the seizure of the island of Rodriguez by a British Army force from India under Lieutenant Colonel Henry Keating. This small island was close enough to Isle de France to provide an effective base for the British blockade squadron and a staging area for a future invasion of the French islands.|$|E
50|$|As a lieutenant, he {{also served}} in the 6th Infantry Regiment. In May 1937 he was {{promoted}} to captain and began to serve on the National Security Council. Later <b>he</b> was <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Curitiba in the state of Parana. Soon after, <b>he</b> was <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Joinville, serving in the 13th Chasseurs' Brigade.|$|R
5000|$|Prevented {{from going}} to Indochina because of {{unspecified}} serious events, <b>he</b> was <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Pondicherry mission. One hearing this news he exclaimed [...] "then the society is afraid to make martyrs". He arrived at Pondicherry on August 18, 1900, and was appointed Professor in seminar-College, under the strict direction of father Elisabeth. After three years of service there, in August 1903, <b>he</b> was <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Tindivanam as assistant to father Combes. In April 1904, <b>he</b> was <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Chetpet, as vicar of father Darras. He was parish priest of Chetpet until 1915. This post at Chetpet really was father Colas's preferred position. During World War I French Mobilization, {{he had to leave}} for France in January 1915. <b>He</b> was <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Salonika. In March 1917, he was demobilised and returned to Pondicherry to regain his post at Chetpet.|$|R
50|$|During World War II, <b>he</b> was <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> a {{detention}} camp.|$|R
5|$|Thames {{subsequently}} {{returned to}} Brest with Allemand's squadron on 25 October, although the British ship was thoroughly looted during the journey by the French sailors, whose officers {{were unable to}} exert any control over them. The ship's officers had been removed, including the surgeon, and therefore the British wounded did not receive medical treatment until the squadron arrived at Brest on 25 October; two subsequently died, making the total British deaths 13, with 21 wounded. Cotes wrote {{a report on the}} engagement, which <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> the Admiralty from captivity in Gisors, which the French authorities intercepted and delayed, with the result that the first news of Thames fate did not arrive in Britain until 7 May 1794. Cotes was soon afterwards exchanged and returned to Britain, where a court-martial investigating the loss of Thames exonerated him. Several of his officers were not repatriated however, remaining in French captivity for the next two years.|$|E
5|$|When winter {{came and}} there was no work {{available}} on the ranches, he collaborated with Christin on a six-page strip called Le Rhum du Punch, a copy of which <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Jean Giraud who was by now writing and illustrating Blueberry for the Franco-Belgian comics magazine Pilote. Giraud showed the strip to Pilotes editor, Rene Goscinny, who agreed to publish it (issue 335, 24 March 1966). This was followed by another collaboration titled Comment réussir en affaires en se donnant un mal fou (How to succeed in business by almost killing oneself through hard work) which was also published in Pilote (issue 351, 14 July 1966). By this stage Mézières visa was almost expired and so he used the money from these strips to pay for his ticket home. In leaving America, Mézières also left behind a young woman, Linda, one of Christin's students: she followed him to France some months later and is now his wife.|$|E
5|$|Other {{scientists}} {{working for}} Davros, now {{aware of his}} plans, free the Doctor and give him enough time to rig the Dalek incubation room with explosives which would end {{the threat of the}} Daleks. As he is about to touch the two exposed wire ends to set them off, the Doctor questions if he has the right to make that decision and forgoes setting the explosions off. Just then, he learns that Davros has agreed to stop and allow the Kaled leaders to vote on the continuation of the project. As the leaders gather for this vote, the Doctor is able to recover the Time Ring and destroy the recordings he made, while learning that the Thals and Mutos have prepared the means to destroy the bunker. As the vote is called, Davros reveals this was all a decoy, giving the Daleks <b>he</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> the Thal time to return to the bunker and exterminate the remaining Kaleds. Harry and Sarah escape the chaos, while the Doctor returns to set off the incubator room's explosives, but a Dalek inadvertently completes the circuit and sets it off itself. The Doctor escapes in time before the Thal and Mutos' bomb caves in the bunker, trapping Davros and the Daleks. Inside, Davros realises the Daleks have gained a will of their own, and attempts to stop the production line, but a Dalek incapacitates him.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> is <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> {{jail for}} a crime he didn't commit.|$|R

50|$|In May 1897, Hata was {{appointed}} a legal councilor to Fukui Prefecture. This {{was followed by}} assignments in Ehime, Chiba and Kanagawa Prefectures.
