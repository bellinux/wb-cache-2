50|$|Also, {{throughout}} the years, soundcards have evolved {{in terms of}} digital audio sampling rate (starting from 8-bit 11025 Hz, to 32-bit, 192 kHz that the latest solutions support). Along the way, some cards started offering 'wavetable' sample-based synthesis, which provides superior MIDI synthesis quality relative to the earlier OPL-based solutions, which uses <b>FM-synthesis.</b> Also, some higher end cards started having their own RAM and processor for user-definable sound samples and MIDI instruments {{as well as to}} offload audio processing from the CPU.|$|E
50|$|Scream Tracker 3.0 {{and later}} {{supports}} up to 99 8-bit samples, 32 channels, 100 patterns and 256 order positions. It can also handle up to 9 <b>FM-synthesis</b> channels on sound cards using the popular OPL2/3/4 chipsets, and unusually, can play PCM samples and FM instruments {{at the same}} time. There are channels referred to as R1..8, L1..8 and A1..9 to be assigned to those 32 ones, which gives an effective amount of only 25 channels. Panning is free (16 positions by S8x command) only on the Gravis Ultrasound, on which in turn isn't possible to use the A channels, unless an AdLib card is mounted too.|$|E
50|$|The {{contents}} of the soundtrack of the PC version were determined by running a contest which anybody could participate in, composing tracks based on {{a description of the}} game. Included on the soundtrack are compositions of Aaron Grier, Erol Otus, Eric E. Berge, Riku Nuottaj√§rvi, Kevin Palivec and Dan Nicholson, the president and founding member of The Kosmic Free Music Foundation. Musicians were searched by posting a contest to Amiga users newsgroup because mostly Amiga hobbyists were making sample based tracker music those days. Music is in Protracker-MOD format which uses digitized instrument samples while most of PC game music still relied on <b>FM-synthesis</b> based instruments at the time. The game also supported the Gravis Ultrasound sound card, which was popular among MOD composers.|$|E
5000|$|While the {{original}} Waveblaster greatly improved upon the acoustic {{quality of the}} SB16's built-in <b>FM-synthesis,</b> the acoustic quality of its instrument-set was poorly regarded. By the time the SB16 reached the height of its popularity, competing MIDI-daughterboards had already pushed aside the Waveblaster. In particular, Roland's Sound Canvas daughterboards (SCD-10/15), priced higher than Creative's offering, were highly regarded for their unrivalled musical reproduction in MIDI-scored game titles. (This was due to Roland's dominance in the production aspect of the MIDI game soundtracks; Roland's daughterboards shared the same synthesis-engine and instrument sound-set as the popular Sound Canvas 55, a commercial MIDI module favored by game composers.) By comparison, the WaveBlaster's instruments were improperly balanced, with many instruments striking at different volume-levels (relative to the de facto standard, Sound Canvas.) ...|$|E
