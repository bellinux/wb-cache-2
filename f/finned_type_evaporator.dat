The heat exchanger was of the shell and tube type, having extended longitudinal steel fins welded to the tube. Auxiliary equipment consisted of an oil pump, oil storage reservoirs, piping, and means for measurement of temperatures and oil flow rates. The unit was operated both as a <b>fin</b> <b>type</b> heat exchanger with the oil in contact with the finned surfaces, and as a straight tube and shell exchanger with the oil on the tube side. Oil flow rates and temperatures were varied over a wide range. The data obtained was calculated by the means of existing empirical equations, and the results were compared with those of previous investigators and with the proposed correlations by plotting. The experimentally determined film coefficients obtained on the exchanger when operated as a <b>fin</b> <b>type</b> were found to be in agreement with the best existing correlation. Coefficients determined on the straight tube and shell exchanger were found to be forty per cent higher than the values predicted by this correlation. A comparison was drawn between the exchanger as a <b>fin</b> <b>type</b> and as a shell and tube <b>type.</b> The <b>fin</b> <b>type</b> was found to transfer approximately four hundred per cent as much heat per unit length of exchanger as did the straight shell and tube type.

The experimental set-up {{consists of an}} evaporator and a condenser connected by flexible tubing. The evaporator corresponds to a high-power CPU, and the condenser represents a cooling plate located behind the display of notebook computer. The evaporator and the condenser have the outer dimensions of 50 mm× 50 mm× 20 mm and 150 mm× 200 mm× 20 mm, respectively. The effects of the heat input Q and the charged volume of Fluorinert liquid F on the heat transfer characteristics of the cooling system were studied experimentally. Further, the experiments using several <b>types</b> of <b>evaporators</b> to enhance the boiling in the evaporator were carried out.

40|$|Problem statement: One of {{the most}} {{important}} components of a solar energy system is the&# 13; solar collector. The performances of double-pass solar collector with longitudinal fins absorbers are&# 13; analyzed. Approach: The study involves a theoretical study to investigate the effect of mass flow rate,&# 13; number and height of fins on efficiency, which involves steady-state energy balance equations on the&# 13; longitudinal fins absorber of solar collectors. The theoretical solution procedure of the energy&# 13; equations uses a matrix inversion method and making some algebraic rearrangements.

40|$|A {{study on}} the effects of frost growth on the {{performance}} of finned tube heat exchangers under laminar flow has been conducted. The study was both experimental and analytical. The experimental part of the investigation dealt with different fin geometries: louvered, corrugated, wavy, flat plate fins and also spine <b>fin</b> <b>types.</b> 	The parameters which were varied include the air humidity, air and refrigerant temperature, air flow rate and fin density. A new term called the energy transfer coefficient has been defined to account for the combined heat and mass transfer processes occurring during frosting. The variables measured were the amount of frost growth, the energy transfer coefficient, the pressure drop across the coils, the enthalpy drop, and the effectiveness of the coils. The general trends were found to be consistent with the literature. It was found that the frost growth increases with humidity, air temperature, velocity and fin density due to an increase in the mass transfer. The dominant factor was the humidity content of the air. When the relative humidity was increased from 74 % to 80 % at an air temperature of 32 degrees F, the frost growth increased by approximately 22 %. The energy transfer coefficient initially increases by 10 to 15 % with the onset of frost formation due to increased surface area and surface roughness but then drops off due to the insulating layer of frost. The louvered <b>fin</b> <b>type</b> had the highest energy transfer coefficient in the neighborhood of 50 Btu/hr-F-sq. ft. as compared to the flat <b>fin</b> <b>type</b> which was in the neighborhood of 38 Btu/hr-sq. ft. ? However, when these results were normalized with respect to dry co. 1 ditions, {{it was found that the}} flat <b>fin</b> <b>type</b> performed better than the louvered <b>fin</b> <b>type.</b> A mathematical model was developed to simulate the experiments, based on fundamental heat and mass transfer principles. Due to the complexity of the problem, the model in its present form can handle flat plate <b>fin</b> <b>types</b> only. In addition to being able to predict energy transfer and frost growth, the model also performs a non-dimensional analysis on the heat exchanger performance in terms of NTU - Effectiveness, and Fin Performance.

Environmentally harmful refrigerants, CFC's and HCFC's, have already been shifted toward environmental friendly refrigerants such as HFC's and hydro carbons. However HFC's have a significant global warming potential. Accordingly, new policies have taken effect which are forcing the refrigerator industry to develop refrigerators that will reduce energy consumption and refrigerant emissions to reduce energy bills and the global warming effects of refrigerators. This study presents the research conducted on the condenser improvement {{of one of the}} commercially available household refrigerators and designing and applying a so-called Alternating evaporator duty cycle (AED) with a two step capacity modulated compressor. In the condenser improvement study, a household refrigerator's condenser configuration was changed from the cross-flow configuration to the counter-flow configuration without changing other components and cabinet structure. Ten experiments for different refrigerant charges were conducted and it was experimentally proved that the refrigerator with counter flow condenser consumes 1 % less energy compared to the one with cross-flow condenser. To study the potential of the AED cycle, a side-by-side household refrigerator equipped with a conventional cycle was converted into the AED cycle. First of all, the performance of the refrigerator with the new cycle was simulated and then cycle components were designed. Two different kinds of evaporators were used for food (R) cabinet such as forced convection fin-and-tube <b>type</b> <b>evaporator</b> (FCE) and natural convection tube-and-plate <b>type</b> <b>evaporator</b> (NCE), to investigate the humidity control improvement.
