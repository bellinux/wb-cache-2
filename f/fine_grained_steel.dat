40|$|The {{treatment}} of <b>fine</b> <b>grained</b> <b>steel</b> slags with CO 2 at elevated pressure and temperature conditions {{is a process}} that allows to produce high quality building materials. In this process the mineral waste is stabilized and CO 2 is permanently sequestered in the form of carbonates. However, in order to enhance the sequestration potential and further improve the quality of the building materials, it is essential to understand the carbonate formation and the impact of this process on the pore network in the building material. A better understanding of the process will translate in improved building materials and enhanced CO 2 sequestration. In this study, the process of carbonate formation stainless steel slags is investigated. The carbonate formation in the pore network of the <b>fine</b> <b>grained</b> <b>steel</b> slags is monitored during CO 2 exposure in a specially designed mini reactor using high resolution X-ray tomography (HRXCT). The use of this non-destructive technique allows to visualize and quantify the amount carbonate that is precipitated inside the building material.

40|$|In warm rolled steels, the {{intensity}} of the //ND annealing texture, which favours formability, has been related to the formation of shear bands during rolling. Coarse hot band grain sizes (HBGS's) facilitate flow localization, the mechanism associated with the formation of shear bands. In this work, the effect of grain size after hot rolling was studied in a low carbon steel containing small additions of Cr and Mn. The formation of shear bands and their subsequent influence on the normal anisotropy r(m) and planar anisotropy Delta r in the annealed steels were of particular interest. Two HBGS's (18 and 30 mu m) were employed and the specimens were warm rolled to reductions of 65 and 80 % at various temperatures between 640 and 700 degrees C. The results show that the frequency of shear banding is slightly lower for the smaller grain size.

The welded nodes from the high-strength steel underwent post-weld treatments like shot peening, profile reinforcement, and TIG-dressing.

40|$|Abstract. Yielding of {{polycrystalline}} {{low carbon}} steel {{is characterized by a}} clear yield point followed by unstable Lüders deformation and such a yielding behavior is taken over to <b>fine</b> <b>grained</b> <b>steel</b> with the grain size of 1 µm or less. Yield strength of ferritic steel is increased with grain refinement standing on the Hall-Petch relation. The following equation is realized up to 0. 2 µm grain size in the relation between yield strength σy and grain size d: σy [MPa] = 100 + 600 ×d[µm]- 1 / 2. In {{low carbon steel}}, it might be concluded that the Hall-Petch coefficient (ky) is around 600 MPa·µm 1 / 2. However, the ky value of interstitial free steels is substantially small as 130 - 180 MPa·µm 1 / 2 and it can be greatly increased by a small amount of solute carbon less than 20 ppm. It was also cleared that the disappearance of yield point by purifying is due to the decrease in the ky value. On the other hand, the ky value is changeable depending on heat treatment conditions such as cooling condition from an elevated temperature and aging treatment at 90 ºC. These results suggest the contribution of carbon segregation at grain boundary in terms of the change in the ky value. On the contrary, substitutional elements such as Cr and Si do not give large influence to the ky value in comparison with the effect by carbon...|$|E

40|$|<b>Fine</b> <b>grained</b> {{advanced}} <b>steels</b> exhibit favourable {{mechanical properties}} for applications requiring high strength, ductility and impact toughness. These properties {{result from a}} microstructure containing a fine distribution of several phases including ferrite, austenite, martensite and bainite. The bainite phase {{is in the form}} of fine lamellas of ferrite and carbon-enriched austenite which due to proper control of the chemical composition is lacking the nanometre scaled carbides associated with traditional bainite. The mechanisms of bainite phase transformations in steels have been debated since the naming of bainite in 1934, and range from diffusion-controlled (reconstructive) to diffusionless (displacive). Interest in the manufacture and application of <b>fine</b> <b>grained</b> advanced multiphase <b>steels</b> can be dated back to the 1970 s, and it has been intensified after the turn of the century with the industrial production and application of such steels. The structure and mechanical properties of <b>fine</b> <b>grained</b> advanced <b>steels</b> produced using novel thermal treatments are described. The results of in-situ x-ray diffraction studies of the austenite to bainite transformation process provide information about the effect of carbon redistribution on the formation of transformation products. Transformation microstructures created by various thermal treatments are characterised using optical and scanning electron microscopy, which reveal the presence of martensite, bainite (in various forms), ferrite and retained austenite. Microstructural control is found to be possible by quenching the steels from the austenite phase to temperatures below the start temperature of martensite formation (determined by steel composition). The quenching is followed by isothermal treatment for varying times at temperatures related to the formation of transformation products (bainite in particular). This combined heat treatment also increases the rate of phase transformation in comparison with isothermal treatments. Thus multiphase microstructures are produced, which are found to possess favourable mechanical properties, in particular tensile strength, toughness and wear resistance. In press hardening of 0. 26 wt-carbon steels, by using the combined heat treatment described, the yield strength was found to be comparable to existing materials and the ductility was found to be higher. Welding tests of medium carbon steel with control of the post weld time temperature cycle in accordance with the combined heat treatment process minimized the risk of brittle phase formation in the weld as well as the heat affected zone. In addition the wear resistance in sliding as well as in rolling-sliding was shown to be better for austempered medium carbon high-silicon <b>steels</b> with <b>fine</b> <b>grained</b> ferritic austenitic microstructure in comparison with conventional steels. The presented work can be regarded as a contribution to the current world-wide effort to develop the 3 rd generation advanced high-strength steels, which are expected to be a substantial part of the structural steel market before the end of the present decade. The switch to such steels in a large number of applications in manufacturing of transport vehicles and other products, will be comparable with the switch from plain carbon steels to HSLA steels in the seventies and eighties.

In order not to interfere with residual stresses they were relieved by a heat treatment. In-phase loading can be treated fairly well using the conventional hypotheses (von Mises or Tresca) on basis of nominal, structural or local strains or stresses. But the influence of out-of-phase loading on fatigue life is severely overestimated if conventional hypotheses are used. However, the introduced hypothesis of the effective equivalent stress (EESH) leads to fairly well predictions. For this, the knowledge of local strains or stresses is necessary.

This hypothesis considers the fatigue-life reducing influence of out-of-phase loading by taking into account the interaction of local shear stresses acting in different surface planes of the material.

It could be shown that cracks always started at MnS - precipitates, and that the intergranular crack propagation was enhan ced by the segregation of phosphorus.

40|$|The {{effect of}} warm and cold rolling {{parameters}} {{on the development}} of annealing textures and their effects on the final formability were studied in two LC steels containing 0. 8 %Cr. Warm rolling temperatures between 640 and 750 °C were employed, together with reductions of 65 % to 80 %. The effects of an additional cold rolling reduction of 40 %, different initial hot band grain sizes (HBGSs) and a decrease in the heating rate during annealing were also studied. The ND fibre, //ND, of the recrystallization texture was strengthened as the warm rolling temperature was decreased. A noticeable improvement in both the continuity and intensity of the ND fibre was obtained when samples were submitted to an additional 40 % cold rolling reduction. The ND fibre was even more continuous and intense when a low heating rate was utilized, yielding r-values of 1. 2 and 1. 3 for the warm rolled and warm plus cold rolled samples, respectively. On the other hand, the volume fraction of grains containing shear bands is slightly lower for the finer HBGS. However, this does not reduce the amount of in-grain nucleation of gamma grains, suggesting that shear bands are not the only factor that has to be considered in the improvement of warm rolling textures. Although the normal anisotropy is not affected by the HBGS, much lower Deltar values were associated with the <b>finer</b> <b>grained</b> <b>steel.</b> The texture changes taking place during recrystallization were examined using electron back-scattered diffraction. The recrystallization textures resemble the deformation textures but with a more extensive alpha fibre that includes the { 113 } orientation; the gamma fibre extends to the { 554 }. These two orientations are related to the { 112 } deformed grains by near 26 º rotations about selected axes. Nevertheless, both orientations appear {{in the early stages of}} recrystallization, an observation that does not support the oriented growth theory. The { 111 } orientations are the first to recrystallize while the alpha fibre is present until the end of recrystallization. It is finally consumed by all types of grains as well as by subgrain coalescence. The relatively constant volume fractions of the main orientations and the similarities in the growth rates for the { 111 } and random orientations suggest that recrystallization is controlled by the oriented nucleation concept...|$|R
40|$|The structure–property {{relationship}} was studied in an Fe- 18 Mn- 0. 6 C- 1. 5 Al steel subjected to cold rolling to various total reductions from 20 % to 80 % and subsequent annealing for 30 min at temperatures of 673 to 973 K. The cold rolling resulted in significant {{strengthening of the}} steel. The hardness increased from 1900 to almost 6000 MPa after rolling reduction of 80 %. Recovery of cold worked microstructure developed during annealing at temperatures of 673 and 773 K, resulting in slight softening, which did not exceed 0. 2. On the other hand, static recrystallization readily developed in the cold rolled samples with total reductions above 20 % during annealing at 873 and 973 K, leading to fractional softening of about 0. 8. The recrystallized grain size depended on annealing temperature and rolling reduction; namely, it decreased with {{a decrease in the}} temperature and an increase in the rolling reduction. The mean recrystallized grain size from approximately 1 to 8 μm could be developed depending on the rolling/annealing conditions. The recovered and <b>fine</b> <b>grained</b> recrystallized <b>steel</b> samples were characterized by improved strength properties. The yield strength of the recovered, recrystallized, and partially recrystallized steel samples could be expressed by a unique relationship taking into account the fractional contributions from dislocation and grain size strengthening into overall strength...|$|R
40|$|Grain size {{reduction}} in single phase alloys generally {{goes along with}} a loss of ductility associated to a decrease of the strain hardening capacity. The flow behaviour of <b>fine</b> <b>grained</b> dual phase <b>steels</b> produced by swaging was investigated in order to address the couplings between grain {{size reduction}} and incorporation of a second phase, and to optimize microstructures towards different objectives. A physically based grain size dependent strain hardening model has been developed for the ferrite, involving specific laws for the accumulation and saturation of dislocations along grain boundaries and for their net back stress contribution. The back stress increases with the dislocation density, reaches a maximum and finally decreases due to the screening of opposite dislocations located {{on the other side of}} the boundary. The overall behaviour of the ferrite – martensite composite is then calculated using a mean field homogenization method. A parametric study provides, for a given carbon content and grain size of the ferrite matrix, the optimum martensite volume fraction leading either to the maximum strength ductility product or to the maximum strength under the constraint of sufficient ductility for forming...|$|R
40|$|In the {{transportation}} industry, weight reduction {{is essential in}} order to reduce fuel consumption. A solution towards lighter structures is to improve the mechanical properties while keeping a sufficient ductility for the forming operations. The aim of the thesis was to investigate the enhancement of the mechanical properties of metallic alloys by the refinement of the grain size while playing with other microstructural features {{in order to maintain the}} strain hardening, and thus the ductility, as high as possible. Various <b>fine</b> <b>grained</b> dual phase <b>steels</b> were produced by severe plastic deformation followed by thermal treatment. Nano-indentation and tensile tests have been performed to measure the change of flow properties associated to the grain refinement. A new methodology, based on performing nano-indentation tests at different depth inside each phases of the steels, has been proposed in order to separate the different hardening contributions affecting the behaviour of the material. In order to gain a better understanding of the link between the <b>fine</b> <b>grained</b> microstructure and the flow properties, three models were developed introducing successively a richer and richer description of the microstructure. The first model allows interpreting the nano-indentation data at different depths. The second model predicts the flow curve of dual phase steels by considering the accumulation of dislocations on the grain boundaries with the associated back stress and the saturation of this accumulation of excess dislocations, while introducing the second phase particles through a homogenization scheme. Finally, the third model promotes a new explanation of the Hall-Petch law and the interaction of the grain size and the texture for pure copper using a multigrain crystal plasticity model incorporating grain boundary effects. Guidelines are given to optimize the microstructures towards an improvement of the structural properties and formability. (FSA 3) [...] UCL, 200...|$|R

40|$|Deleterious phases {{precipitation}} in superduplex {{stainless steels}} {{is the main}} concern in fabrication by welding and hot forming of this class of material. Sigma, chi and secondary austenite phases are considered deleterious phases because they produce negative effects on corrosion resistance. Besides, sigma and chi phases also promote strong decrease of toughness. In the present work, the precipitations of sigma, chi and secondary austenite under aging in the 800 - 950 °C interval were studied in two UNS S 32750 steels with different grain sizes. The deleterious phases could be quantified by light optical microscopy, with no distinction between them. Scanning electron microscopy was used to distinguish the individual phases in various aging conditions. The results elucidate {{the influence of the}} aging temperature and grain size on the kinetics precipitation and morphology of deleterious phases. The kinetics of deleterious phases is higher in the <b>fine</b> <b>grained</b> material in the initial stage of aging, but the maximum amount of deleterious phases is higher in the coarse <b>grained</b> <b>steel...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview on obtaining low-carbon ultra-fine <b>grained</b> dual-phase <b>steels</b> through rapid intercritical annealing of cold-rolled sheet as improved materials for automotive applications. A laboratory processing route was designed that involves cold-rolling of a tempered martensite structure followed by a second tempering step to produce a <b>fine</b> <b>grained</b> aggregate of ferrite and carbides as the initial microstructure for rapid intercritical annealing. The intercritical annealing step was performed with heating and cooling rates of at least 100 °C/s and a holding time of 30 s. The intercritical temperature was selected to result in 20 - 35 % martensite in the final microstructures for C-Mn steels with carbon contents of 0. 06, 0. 12 and 0. 17 wt%, respectively. The proposed processing routes produced an ultra-fine grained ferrite-martensite structure withgrain sizes of approximately 1 ?m for all three steels. The tensile strength of these ultra-fine <b>grained</b> dualphase <b>steels</b> can be increased by up to 200 MPa as compared to coarse-grained dual-phase steels while maintaining uniform elongation values. The rather narrow processing window necessary to obtain these properties was evaluated by determining the effect of intercritical annealing conditions on microstructure evolution. Further, the experimental results were confirmed with phase field simulations of austenite formation indicating that rapid heat treatment cycles are essential to obtain <b>fine</b> <b>grained</b> intercritical austenite that leads to martensite islands with sizes of 1 ?m and below in the final microstructure...|$|R
