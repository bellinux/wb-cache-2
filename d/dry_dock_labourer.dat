[...] The ties were enhanced {{by the fact that}} Frank Kirby, John Owen, and James McMillan of Detroit <b>Dry</b> <b>Dock</b> slowly acquired shares in <b>Dry</b> <b>Dock</b> Engine Works. [...] By the end of the 1880s, virtually all of the <b>Dry</b> <b>Dock</b> Engine Works shares were owned by Detroit <b>Dry</b> <b>Dock</b> principals. [...] In 1892, James McMillan took over the presidency of <b>Dry</b> <b>Dock</b> Engine Works, and the two firms were controlled by the same person.

50|$|The Scottish Union of <b>Dock</b> <b>Labourers</b> was a Glasgow-based {{trade union}} for {{waterfront}} workers. It was formed during the seamen's and dockers' strikes of June-July 1911.

The president of the SUDL throughout its lifetime was Joe Houghton.

5000|$|A {{floating}} <b>dry</b> <b>dock</b> {{is a type}} of pontoon for <b>dry</b> <b>docking</b> ships, possessing floodable buoyancy {{chambers and}} a [...] "U"-shaped cross-section. The walls are used to give the <b>dry</b> <b>dock</b> stability when the floor or deck is {{below the surface of the}} water. When valves are opened, the chambers fill with water, causing the <b>dry</b> <b>dock</b> to float lower in the water. The deck becomes submerged and this allows a ship to be moved into position inside. When the water is pumped out of the chambers, the <b>dry</b> <b>dock</b> rises and the ship is lifted out of the water on the rising deck, allowing work to proceed on the ship's hull.|$|R
