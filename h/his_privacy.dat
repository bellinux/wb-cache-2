5|$|In December 1930, Einstein visited America for {{the second}} time, {{originally}} intended as a two-month working visit as {{a research fellow at}} the California Institute of Technology.

5|$|On the book's publication, Waugh's friends praised it, but {{its general}} {{critical}} reception was muted. Most reviewers admired the self-portrait of Waugh {{with which the}} novel opens, but expressed divided views about the rest, in particular the ending. Commentators have debated whether the novel provides a real-life depiction of Waugh, or if it represents the exaggerated persona that he cultivated {{as a means of}} preserving <b>his</b> <b>privacy.</b> The book has been dramatised for radio and as a stage play.|$|E
5|$|Plutarch {{says that}} Pericles stood first among the Athenians for forty years. If this was so, Pericles {{must have taken}} up a {{position}} of leadership by the early 460s BC- in his early or mid-thirties. Throughout these years he endeavored to protect <b>his</b> <b>privacy</b> and to present himself {{as a model for}} his fellow citizens. For example, he would often avoid banquets, trying to be frugal.|$|E

He began his studies at University College London in September 2005, where {{he was president of}} the school's Islamic society in 2006 and 2007, during which time he participated in, along with political discussions, such activities as martial arts and paintballing.

To protect <b>his</b> <b>privacy,</b> they did not pass the information along to American officials.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of his trap-shooting career, Bain {{developed}} an appreciation for nature. He bought an ownership share of the Portage Country Club, on the Delta Marsh near the south shore of Lake Manitoba, and later donated the land to Ducks Unlimited. Bain built the Mallard Lodge as a personal retreat on land adjacent to the club. He strictly enforced <b>his</b> <b>privacy,</b> even building a road to his lodge that he allowed no one else to use; members of the Portage Country Club were required to take a different route. Bain intended to donate his lodge to the government of Manitoba for preservation, though he died before he could do so. The lodge passed into the control of the government regardless, and was donated to the University of Manitoba as a research facility in 1966 that remains active today. Bain was {{also a member of the}} Manitoba Game and Fish Association and the Winnipeg Humane Society.|$|E
5|$|During the 2004 trial {{regarding}} {{allegations of}} Rush Limbaugh's drug abuse, the ACLU argued that <b>his</b> <b>privacy</b> {{should not have}} been compromised by allowing law enforcement examination of his medical records. In June 2004, the school district in Dover, Pennsylvania, required that its high school biology students listen to a statement which asserted that the theory of evolution is not fact and mentioning intelligent design as an alternative theory. Several parents called the ACLU to complain, because they believed that the school was promoting a religious idea in the classroom and violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The ACLU, joined by Americans United for Separation of Church and State, represented the parents in a lawsuit against the school district. After a lengthy trial, Judge John E. Jones III ruled in favor of the parents in the Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District decision, finding that intelligent design is not science and permanently forbidding the Dover school system from teaching intelligent design in science classes.|$|E

5|$|Pinfold is very {{protective}} of <b>his</b> <b>privacy,</b> but uncharacteristically agrees {{to be interviewed}} on BBC radio. The main inquisitor is a man named Angel, whose voice and manner disconcert Pinfold, who believes he detects a veiled malicious intent. In the weeks that follow, Pinfold broods on the incident. He finds his memory beginning to play tricks on him. The encroaching winter depresses him further; he decides to escape by taking a cruise, and secures passage on the SS Caliban, bound for Ceylon. As the voyage proceeds, Pinfold finds that he hears sounds and conversations {{from other parts of}} the ship which he believes are somehow being transmitted into his cabin. Amid an increasingly bizarre series of overheard incidents, he hears remarks which become progressively more insulting, and then directly threatening towards himself. The main tormentors are a man and a woman, whose vicious words are balanced by those of an affectionate younger woman, Margaret. He is convinced that the man is the BBC interviewer Angel, using his technical knowledge to broadcast the voices. Pinfold spends sleepless nights, awaiting a threatened beating, a kidnapping attempt and a seductive visit from Margaret.|$|E

25|$|While {{working on}} Forbidden Colors, Mishima visited gay bars in Japan.

Shalit was also visited at his home by Israeli President Shimon Peres and French Ambassador Christophe Bigot.|$|E

25|$|Coombe Farm {{is a large}} {{farmhouse}} off Oaks Road, reached via Oaks Lane. Oaks Lane was {{the former}} main road, closed by John Maberly of Shirley House in 1803 to increase <b>his</b> <b>privacy.</b> Oaks Road was its replacement and Oaks Lane is now open again to walkers. The building probably dates from the 16th century, with 19th-century additions. In 1893, another brother of Frank Lloyd, Herbert, built a much larger new building with mock-Tudor features beside the original building. The farm is now the centre of Dr. Anwar Ansari's housing services and property development company AA Homes & Housing Limited. There are also old farmhouses and lodges along Oaks Lane.|$|E

25|$|Although {{his work}} in the field was revolutionary, Goddard {{received}} very little public support for his research and development work. The press sometimes ridiculed his theories of spaceflight. As a result, he became protective of <b>his</b> <b>privacy</b> and his work. Years after his death, {{at the dawn of the}} Space Age, he came to be recognized as one of the founding fathers of modern rocketry, along with Robert Esnault-Pelterie, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, and Hermann Oberth. He not only recognized the potential of rockets for atmospheric research, ballistic missiles and space travel but was the first to scientifically study, design and construct the rockets needed to implement those ideas.|$|E
25|$|Harold Holt became Prime Minister of Australia in January 1966, {{following}} {{the retirement of}} Robert Menzies. He was a career politician, having first entered parliament {{at the age of}} 27 and been appointed to cabinet at the age of 30. Emulating Menzies, Holt refused a security detail upon taking office – he considered it unnecessary and potentially alienating to the general public. His stance changed after two incidents in mid-1966 – a window in his office was shattered by a sniper, and then an assassination attempt was made on Arthur Calwell, the Leader of the Opposition. Holt begrudgingly accepted a single bodyguard for his official duties, but refused any protection while on holiday, regarding it as a violation of <b>his</b> <b>privacy.</b> His wife Zara would later suggest that this was so he could hide his extramarital affairs.|$|E
25|$|The {{filming of}} Mutiny on the Bounty {{affected}} Brando's {{life in a}} profound way, as {{he fell in love}} with Tahiti and its people. He bought a 12-island atoll, Tetiaroa, and in 1970 hired an award-winning young Los Angeles architect, Bernard Judge, to build his home and natural village there without despoiling the environment. An environmental laboratory protecting sea birds and turtles was established and student groups were welcomed there for many years. Tragically, the 1983 hurricane destroyed many of the structures including his resort. A hotel using Brando's name is currently under reconstruction under new ownership due to open in 2014. His son Simon is the only inhabitant of Tetiaroa. Brando was an active ham radio operator, with the call signs KE6PZH and FO5GJ (the latter from his island). He was listed in the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) records as Martin Brandeaux to preserve <b>his</b> <b>privacy.</b>|$|E
