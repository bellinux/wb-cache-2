40|$|A famous dictum in {{open economy}} {{macroeconomics}} - which obtains in the Mundell-Fleming world of sticky prices and perfect capital mobility - {{holds that the}} choice of the optimal exchange rate regime should depend on the type of shock hitting the economy. If shocks are predominantly real, a flexible exchange rate is optimal, whereas if shocks are mainly monetary, a fixed exchange rate is optimal. There is no obvious reason, however, why this paradigm should be the most appropriate one to think about this important issue. Arguably, asset market frictions may be as pervasive as <b>goods</b> market <b>frictions</b> (particularly in developing countries). In this light, we show that in a model with flexible prices and asset market frictions, the Mundell-Fleming dictum is turned on its head: flexible rates are optimal in the presence of monetary shocks, whereas fixed rates are optimal in response to real shocks. We thus conclude that the choice of an optimal exchange rate regime should depend not only on the type of shock (real versus monetary) but also on the type of <b>friction</b> (<b>goods</b> versus asset market). ...|$|R
40|$|My thesis {{consists}} of three chapters {{that contribute to the}} study of input misallocation and TFP growth in China. In Chapter 2, I compare the misallocation of intermediate goods to those of capital and labor, which have been extensively studied in the literature. To measure misallocation, I compute the dispersion of marginal products of intermediate goods across firms, and the potential output gains by eliminating this dispersion in China Industrial Enterprise Survey (CIES) data. Although the within-industry dispersion of marginal products of intermediates is smaller than that of capital and labor, gross output and value added gains from reallocating intermediate goods are 6 and 14 times those from capital and labor reallocations. If intermediate goods, capital and labor are reallocated to equalize their marginal products, the total value added gain in the CIES is 550 %, much greater than the 98 % obtained under the value added approach in the literature (i. e. Hsieh and Klenow, 2009). This suggests that with its 74 % revenue share and input complementarity, distortions and <b>frictions</b> through intermediate <b>goods</b> could be a promising channel to account for sizable misallocation in China’s data. I further find suggestive evidence of preorder friction: intermediate goods need half a year to pre-order, which gives rise to borrowing constraints in paying for intermediates. Similar to capital, marginal products of intermediates are found to be more dispersed among potentially constrained firms with low net worth, as one would expect if borrowing constraints exist. Motivated by the findings in Chapter 2, Chapter 3 quantifies the novel role of pre-order friction and borrowing constraints on intermediate goods in accounting for misallocation in the CIES data (Hsieh and Klenow, 2009; Brandt, Van Biesebroeck, and Zhang, 2012). With a gross output production function, I incorporate intermediate <b>goods</b> <b>frictions</b> into the firm investment model of Cooper and Haltiwanger (2006). Firms order and prepay for a fraction of intermediate goods one period in advance (pre-order), and face one borrowing constraint on capital and intermediate goods. Firms also face capital adjustment costs. I measure misallocation by the potential gross output gain as a percentage of actual gross output, if intermediate goods, capital and labor are hypothetically reallocated to equalize marginal products across firms. Over 1998 - 2007, gross output misallocation in the CIES data averages 140 percent. The model accounts for around 70 percent of this misallocation, when calibrated to key moments in firm-level debt, productivity and market share distribution in the CIES data. Half of the misallocation in the model is attributed to intermediate goods frictions: 34 percent from borrowing constraints, and 16 percent from pre-order. While borrowing constraints on capital induce small misallocation, capital adjustment costs account for the other half. Larger misallocation with intermediate <b>goods</b> <b>frictions</b> than without arises from its large gross output revenue share and recurrent need of financing. This tightens the borrowing constraint and interrupts the self-financing mechanism for capital accumulation. Further, as in Chapter 2 for the data, I find that value added approach in literature also underestimates misallocation by ignoring misallocation of intermediate goods for the mode. The importance of intermediate <b>goods</b> <b>frictions</b> in misallocation could be applicable to other countries with an underdeveloped financial system. Chapter 4 decomposes China’s fast aggregate manufacturing productivity growth into firm-level technological growth, intensive reallocation of inputs across existing firms and extensive reallocations through net entry. Following Baily, Hulten, and Campbell (1992) ’s approach of aggregate productivity decomposition, I find that extensive reallocation accounts for 93 % and 144 % of 5 -year aggregate productivity growth in 1998 - 2003 and 2002 - 2007 in the CIES. In contrast, intensive reallocation contributes - 10 % and - 93 % to the growth. These estimates are however biased by a left-censoring problem, since CIES does not survey non state owned firms with sales less than 5 million yuan. I propose a methodology accordingly to recover the three sources of growth in China’s manufacturing sector. I find that when China’s data is taken as the manufacturing universe, the role of extensive reallocation in aggregate productivity growth is overstated by a quarter to two thirds during 1998 - 2003 and 2002 - 2007. Most of the overstated magnitude in extensive reallocation is picked up by the intensive reallocation among existing firms. Compared to U. S., intensive reallocation in China’s manufacturing sector is still smaller, but larger than that directly implied in the CIES. This also indicates that the left-censoring problem in other countries should be taken into account when analyzing micro-level sources of aggregate productivity growth across countries...|$|R

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2014. Major: Economics. Advisor: Jos e-V ctor R os-Rull. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 93 pages, appendices A-E. This thesis {{is composed of}} three chapters that study the behavior of economies where trade in both labor and goods market is subject to search frictions. It analyzes the interactions between frictional labor and goods markets and examines technology and preference shocks as alternative sources of business cycle fluctuations in unemployment, hours worked and inventories. In Chapter 1, {{the focus is on}} the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides model with Nash wage bargaining. This model provides a qualitatively appealing theory of unemployment, but its ability to explain the observed magnitude of fluctuations in unemployment remains debated. I add <b>goods</b> market <b>frictions</b> to this model, and show that they affect workers' bargaining position, provide a rationale for a high value of non-market activity and also affect its cyclical properties. These frictions can thus amplify the response of unemployment and vacancies to changes in the measured labor productivity caused by either technology or preference shocks. The response of the vacancy-unemployment ratio in the extended model is about twice as large as in the model with labor search only if either (1) goods and search effort are substitutes in the goods market matching function and fluctuations are a result of a technology shocks, or (2) when goods and search effort are complements in the goods market matching function and the driving force of fluctuations are preference shocks. Finally, I show that if preferences are additively separable and goods market matching function has unit elasticity of substitution, preference and technology shocks are observationally equivalent and can not be separately identified by an economist who would analyze data on labor productivity, output, employment and wages. Chapter 2 shows that introducing <b>goods</b> market <b>frictions</b> into an otherwise standard model provides a simple but attractive framework to analyze the behavior of inventories over the business cycle. It also shows that the behavior of sales and inventories over the business cycle contains information that allows to identify the contribution of technology and preference shocks to fluctuations in unemployment. I employ Bayesian methods to estimate a model with goods and labor search frictions using U. S. data on labor productivity and inventory-sales ratio, and find that the implied response of vacancies and unemployment to changes in measured labor productivity is about twice as large as in the model with labor search only. <b>Goods</b> market <b>frictions</b> also allow the model to account for the main facts on inventories - procyclical inventory investment, countercyclical inventories-sales ratio, and sales which are more volatile than production. In Chapter 3, I examine another shortcoming of the labor search model identified by Shimer (2010) and related to the so called labor wedge - the gap between the firm's marginal product of labor and the household's marginal rate of substitution between consumption and leisure. I show that under the business cycle accounting approach proposed by Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan (2007) <b>goods</b> market <b>frictions</b> in the model manifest themselves as a labor wedge: In an expansion, firms find it easier to sell goods, and consumers benefit from higher availability of goods and smaller disutility from search effort required per unit of consumption purchased; this encourages larger response of the intensive margin of labor supply than in the standard frictionless model. It thus also alleviates the issue arising in model with frictional labor markets, where search frictions act as adjustment costs, and thus result in a labor wedge that resembles a counterfactually procyclical tax on labor income...|$|R
