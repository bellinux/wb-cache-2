25|$|This {{situation}} {{represents a}} conflict of interest and duty. Both X and Y hold fiduciary duties to each other, which means they must subdue their own interests in favor of the duo's collective interest. By signing an individual contract and taking all the money, X has put personal interest above the fiduciary duty. Therefore, a court will find that X has breached his fiduciary duty. The <b>judicial</b> <b>remedy</b> here will be that X holds both the contract and the money in a constructive trust for the duo. Note, X will not be punished or totally denied of the benefit; both X and Y will receive a half share in the contract and the money.|$|E
25|$|The {{mere fact}} that a {{decision-maker}} is conferred wide discretion by law is not reason enough for a weakening of the requirements of natural justice. In the United Kingdom context, this is demonstrated by Ahmed v. H.M. Treasury (No. 1) (2010).

The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom held that since the Al-Qaida Order made no provision for basic procedural fairness, it effectively deprived people designated under the order the fundamental right of access to a <b>judicial</b> <b>remedy</b> and hence was ultra vires the power conferred by the United Nations Act 1946 for the making of the Order.|$|E

In his opinion, the best safeguard against abuse was for citizens [...] "to ensure that the Government elected is composed of men of integrity, honesty and incorruptibility". However, this differed from the position he had taken 22 years earlier when he had recognized {{the possibility of an}} authoritarian, arbitrary government coming to power, and the need for a written constitution which would protect citizens against its oppressive measures.

[...] The report discusses spousal and child abuse, rape, incest, and [...] "honor" [...] crimes. [...] The report suggests that reasons for the PA's failure to respond to the violence include, [...] "discriminatory laws that condone and perpetuate such violence and the virtual absence of institutionalized policies to prevent violence, assist victims, and hold perpetrators accountable". [...] The report outlines Jordanian laws in force in the West Bank and Egyptian laws in Gaza, [...] "include provisions that provide a reduction in penalty to men who kill or attack female relatives committing adultery; relieve rapists who agree to marry their victims from any criminal prosecution; and allow only male relatives to file incest charges on behalf of minors". [...] In addition, HRW interviewed Palestinian police officers, including chiefs of police who, [...] "downplayed the severity of violence against women in the OPT and questioned the need for their involvement in the dissemination of potentially life-saving information to victims." [...] The report also noted that, [...] "police officers and clan leaders regularly [...] "mediate" [...] and [...] "resolve" [...] these cases, typically by returning the abused women to the [...] "care and protection" [...] of her attacker, without ever referring the case to the courts or the woman to social or other services she might need".

40|$|Two cases {{currently}} pending {{before the}} Supreme Court present {{an opportunity for}} the Court to resolve a conflict between two competing models of treaty adjudication: the Marshall model and the Bork model. The Marshall model applies a presumption in favor of <b>judicial</b> <b>remedies</b> for violations of individual treaty rights. The Bork model applies a presumption against private enforcement of treaties in U. S. courts. During the first fifty years of U. S. constitutional history, the Supreme Court consistently applied the Marshallian presumption in favor of <b>judicial</b> <b>remedies.</b> As a judge on the D. C. Circuit in 1984, Robert Bork created the Borkian presumption against judicial enforcement of treaties when he published a concurring opinion in Tel-Oren v. Libyan Arab Republic. Since 1984, many state and federal courts have applied the Bork model to deny <b>judicial</b> <b>remedies</b> for individuals whose treaty rights were violated. The Supreme Court has never endorsed the Bork model. The Bork model is contrary to the Framers’ original understanding of the judicial role in treaty enforcement. Adoption of the Borkian presumption by lower courts was a radical departure from two centuries of consistent Supreme Court jurisprudence. When courts apply the Bork model, they countenance treaty violations by state governments, they abdicate their constitutional responsibility to restrain illegal executive action, and they damage the United States’ international reputation...|$|R

40|$|Preemption {{of common}} law {{remedies}} for individual injuries such as harm to health raises fundamental {{questions about the}} proper allocation of authority between {{the federal and state}} governments and about the role of courts in interpreting statutes and providing remedies for those who suffer injuries. Developing a workable framework for analyzing what we call “remedial preemption” issues can help to ensure an appropriate accommodation of the federal and state interests at stake and promote consistent application of preemption doctrine to state <b>judicial</b> <b>remedies.</b> This article applies a “collective action” framework for preemption analysis to the issue of remedial preemption. Our analysis suggests that while remedial preemption may be justified in some cases, courts should not lightly infer remedial preemption unless: (1) a primary purpose of the federal law is to ensure uniform standards to promote free movement of goods, prevent the export of regulatory burdens by “downstream” states, or solve a not-in-my-backyard problem; and (2) there is strong evidence that state <b>judicial</b> <b>remedies</b> (as opposed to direct state regulation through legislation or the actions of administrative agencies) would interfere with the achievement of those goals. In addition, we conclude that preemption of one common law cause of action does not necessarily warrant preemption of different causes of action for remediation of the same injury. Finally, we argue that courts should be especially reluctant to read the preemptive effect of federal law so as to leave injured persons without any remedy whatsoever. In doing so we pay particular attention {{to the ways in which}} state <b>judicial</b> <b>remedies</b> differ from state regulation by means of statutes or administrative rules, including the differences between legislatures and courts, between legislative rules and judicial decisions, and among possible preemptive effects on <b>judicial</b> <b>remedies.</b> We conclude by analyzing how the Supreme Court’s 2009 holding in Wyeth v.
