40|$|As {{resistance}} genes {{have been}} shown to contain conserved motifs and cluster in many plant genomes, the identification of resistance gene analogues {{can be used as a}} strategy for both the discovery of DNA markers linked to disease resistance loci and the map-based cloning of disease resistance genes. Sugarcane suffers from many important diseases and an analysis of resistance gene analogues offers a means to identify DNA markers linked to resistance loci. However, sugarcane has the most complex genome of any crop plant and initially it is important to understand the extent of resistance <b>gene</b> <b>analogue</b> diversity in the sugarcane genome before genetic analysis. We review herein how more than 100 expressed sequence tags with homology to different resistance genes have been identified in sugarcane with many mapped as single-dose restriction fragment length polymorphism markers. Importantly, some of these resistance gene analogues {{have been shown}} to be linked to disease resistance genes or disease quantitative trait loci. In an attempt to more efficiently analyse additional resistance gene analogues in sugarcane, we report on experiments aimed at investigating the molecular diversity of several resistance <b>gene</b> <b>analogue</b> families using a modified form of a technique termed Ecotilling. Using Ecotilling, we were able to rapidly detect single nucleotide polymorphisms in fragments amplified by PCR from four different resistance <b>gene</b> <b>analogue</b> families, SoRP 1 D, SoPTO, SoXa 21 and SoHs 1 pro- 1. An analysis of a diverse set of sugarcane varieties, including modern sugarcane cultivars and several S. officinarum and S. spontaneum clones, indicated that all amplicons, apart from SoHs 1 pro- 1, contained significant polymorphism within the gene region studied. However, a comparison among these sugarcane clones, including between the parents of two sugarcane mapping populations, indicated that most polymorphisms were multi-dose, not single-dose, preventing their genetic map location or association with disease susceptibility or resistance from being determined...|$|E

Clustering results revealed a significant correlation between the blast resistance and DNA bands with a correlation coefficient of 0. 6117 (α= 0. 01), indicating that the resistance analysis based on RGA-PCR clustering analysis coincided with that based on inoculation. The correlation coefficients, ranging from 0. 1701 to 0. 535, however, depended on the primers. Five pairs of primers, S 1 /AS 3, S 1 INV/S 2 INV, XLRR For/XLRR Rev, Pto-Kin 1 IN/Pto-Kin 2 IN, and NLRR For/NLRR Rev might be applied for blast resistance identification in consideration of their band numbers and polymorphisms, and their correlation coefficients with blast resistance were 0. 5305, 0. 4898, 0. 4059, 0. 3719 and 0. 3524, respectively.

Such vast, well defined knowledge opens the possibility of compare gene products at the level of functionality, finding gene products which have a similar function or are involved in similar biological processes without relying on the conventional sequence similarity approach. Comparisons within such a large space of knowledge are highly data and computing intensive. For this reason this project was based upon the use of the computational GRID, a technology offering large computing and storage resources.

Multipathotype tests confirmed the presence RphP in nine additional barley cultivars and indicated that RphP differed in specificity to the genes Rph 1 to Rph 15 and Rph 18, plus the gene RphX present in the barley cultivar ‘Shyri’. RphP was inherited as a single dominant gene. Mapping studies using a doubled haploid population derived from ‘Chebec’/‘Harrington’ located RphP to the long arm of chromosome 7 H, and demonstrated linkage with an {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} marker (pTAG 732), a resistance <b>gene</b> <b>analogue</b> marker (RLch 4 (Nc)), and two microsatellite markers (HVM 11 and HVM 49) at genetic distances of about 4 - 10 cM.

40|$|Pathogen {{recognition}} {{is the first}} step of immune reactions. In animals and plants, direct or indirect pathogen {{recognition is}} often mediated by a wealth of fast-evolving receptors, many of which contain ligand-binding and signal transduction domains, such as leucine-rich or tetratricopeptide repeat (LRR/TPR) and NB-ARC domains, respectively. In order to identify candidates potentially involved in algal defense, we mined the genome of the brown alga Ectocarpus siliculosus for homologues of these genes and assessed the evolutionary pressures acting upon them. We thus annotated all Ectocarpus LRR-containing genes, in particular an original group of LRR-containing GTPases of the ROCO family, and 24 NB-ARC–TPR proteins. They exhibit high birth and death rates, while a diversifying selection is acting on their LRR (respectively TPR) domain, probably affecting the ligand-binding specificities. Remarkably, each repeat is encoded by an exon, and the intense exon shuffling underpins the variability of LRR and TPR domains. We conclude that the Ectocarpus ROCO and NB-ARC– TPR families are excellent candidates for being involved in recognition/transduction events linked to immunity. We further hypothesize that brown algae may generate their immune repertoire via controlled somatic recombination, so far only known from the vertebrate adaptive immune systems.

The amplified sequences were cloned, sequenced and characterized. The coconut RGAs had high identity to monocot NBS-LRRs. A complete structural analysis and 3 -D modeling of the NBS domain of coconut RGA was also undertaken. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated that the isolated coconut NBS-LRR class RGAs was expressed more in root (wilt) disease resistant genotypes than in susceptible ones.

Ten RGAs were identified from a sugarcane stem expressed sequence tag (EST) library; the remaining 44 were isolated from sugarcane stem, leaf, and root tissue using primers designed to conserved RGA motifs. The map location of 31 of the RGAs was determined in sugarcane and compared with the location of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for brown rust resistance. After 2 years of phenotyping, 3 RGAs were shown to generate markers that {{were significantly associated with}} resistance to this disease. To assist in the understanding of the complex genetic structure of sugarcane, 17 of the 31 RGAs were also mapped in sorghum. Comparative mapping between sugarcane and sorghum revealed syntenic localization of several RGA clusters. The 3 brown rust associated RGAs were shown to map to the same linkage group (LG) in sorghum with 2 mapping to one region and the third to a region previously shown to contain a major rust-resistance QTL in sorghum.

Because the underlying mechanisms that initiate this response are still incompletely defined, this study was aimed to identify novel factors. Liver genes that were up-regulated 6 h after 70 % hepatectomy (PHx) in the rat were selected by cDNA subtractive hybridization. Besides known genes associated with cell proliferation, several novel genes were isolated. The novel gene that was most up-regulated was further studied.

Pfcrt T 76 but not pfmdr 1 Y 86 was more prevalent in samples from women with residual CQ in urine or serum. Parasite densities and multiplicity of infection of pfmdr wild type but not of resistant isolates were reduced by CQ. Adjusted for CQ and pyrimethamine (PYR) in urine, the P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr) N 108 mutation which confers PYR-resistance was 3. 1 and 3 times, respectively, more likely to be detected in isolates containing pfcrt and pfmdr 1 mutations than in those comprising wild type alleles. Pfcrt, pfmdr, and pfdhfr mutations are frequent in P. falciparum from this part of Ghana which may limit the choice of drugs for the prevention of malaria in pregnancy.

In this study we evaluated the transferability of molecular markers developed for closely related legume species to Lathyrus spp. (Medicago truncatula, pea, lentil, faba bean and lupin) and tested the application of those new molecular tools on Lathyrus mapping and diversity studies. Genomic and expressed sequence tag microsatellite, intron-targeted amplified polymorphic, resistance <b>gene</b> <b>analogue</b> and defence-related gene markers were tested. In total 128 (27. 7 %) and 132 (28. 6 %) molecular markers were successfully cross-amplified, respectively in L. cicera and L. sativus. In total, the efficiency of transferability from genomic microsatellites was 5 %, and from gene-based markers, 55 %. For L. cicera, three cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence markers and one derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence marker based on the cross-amplified markers were also developed. Nine of those molecular markers were suitable for mapping in a L. cicera recombinant inbred line population. From the 17 molecular markers tested for diversity analysis, six (35 %) in L. cicera and seven (41 %) in L. sativus were polymorphic and discriminate well all the L. sativus accessions.

Ninety-four individuals belonging to an F 1 progeny derived from a cross between the apple cultivars Discovery and TN 10 - 8 were studied. Two degenerate primers designed from the highly conserved P-loop motif within the NBS domain were used together with adapter primers.

We identified a new monogenically inherited resistance locus that is localized on chromosome 4. The resistance is derived from an ABPT clone, which is originally a complex quadruple hybrid in which Solanum acaule, S. bulbocastanum, S. phureja and S. tuberosum were involved. Resistance data of the original resistant accessions of the wild species and analysis of mobility of AFLP markers linked to the resistance locus suggest that the resistance locus is originating from S. bulbocastanum.

40|$|Control of fungal {{diseases}} {{is a major}} constraint of cut-rose cultivation in greenhouses and {{in transportation}} around the world. Therefore, development of resistant cultivars is a promising {{way to reduce the}} use of chemicals required for controlling the diseases. Genetic analyses and breeding for resistance, however, are hampered by the high degree of heterozygosity and the polyploid nature of cultivated roses. Nucleotide-binding site (NBS) profiling of Van der Linden et al. (2004) was used as a tool enabling a more directed way of studying the genetics of resistance to pathogens responsible for diseases such as powdery mildew. NBS profiling is a multiplex screening technique, producing amplified resistance gene (R-gene) and resistance <b>gene</b> <b>analogue</b> (RGA) fragments by using degenerated primers based on the conserved motifs present in the NBS domain of resistance genes. Since RGAs are abundantly distributed and highly polymorphic within the plant genome, NBS profiling generates multiple markers of putative resistance genes. Twelve NBS degenerated primer/ restriction enzyme combinations were used to genotype the whole rose tetraploid K 5 population (Yan, 2005) and its parents. To generate RGA profiles, the restriction enzymes: AluI, HaeIII, Mse and RsaI were used in combination with degenerated primers NBS 1, NBS 3, and NBS 5 a 6. The profiles were dominantly scored resulting in 106 polymorphic RGA markers which segregated in a 1 : 1 or 3 : 1 ratio. Uni-and bi-parental simplex markers will be mapped on the two available AFLP/SSR K 5 maps (Yan, 2005) with Joinmap 4. 0.

Darüber hinaus stand eine Reihe von ESTs, die bei der Abwehrreaktion von B. napus nach Phoma-Befall eine deutliche Überexpression zeigten, als potentielle Resistenzgenkandidaten zur Verfügung.

Einige der ermittelten Resistenzgenkandidaten stellen interessante Quellen für weitere Forschungsansätze dar, da sie in B. napus an unterschiedlichen Abwehrmechanismen, wie die hypersensitive Reaktion oder der systemisch erworbenen Resistenz, beteiligt sein könnten. Des Weiteren wurden zahlreiche SSR-Marker identifiziert, die ebenfalls eine signifikante Assoziation mit Phoma-Resistenz im Genotypen-Coreset zeigten. Viele dieser SSR-Allele wurden in B. napus bereits genetisch kartiert, so dass deren Genompositionen in Relation zu bekannten quantitative trait loci (QTL) für Phoma-Resistenz zum Teil verglichen werden konnten. In einigen Fällen kommen die Marker in Genomregionen vor, in denen signifikante Resistenz-QTL bekannt sind. Solche Marker sind daher ebenfalls aussichtsreiche Kandidaten für die Selektion auf Phoma-Resistenz und stehen nun für die Marker-gestütze Nutzung von allelischer Diversität in der Züchtung von Phoma-resistenten Rapssorten zur VerfügungThe work {{described in this}} thesis aimed at detection and exploitation of genetic diversity in resistance gene candidate sequences associated with resistance to blackleg disease (Leptosphaeria maculans) in Brassica napus. Blackleg {{is one of the}} most important diseases of B. napus worldwide, with yield losses of up to 50 % in epidemic years. A broad variation for L. maculans resistance is present in the B. napus gene pool, however due to the quantitative nature of the resistance it is difficult to develop effective selection markers. For practical breeding the development of effective selection markers is desirable. In a genome-wide approach, resistance <b>gene</b> <b>analogue</b> (RGA) sequences were amplified in B. napus genotypes using degenerate primers for resistance gene motifs (TIR, NBS, LRR). In addition to these anonymous sequences, further primer combinations were developed using potential resistance gene candidates (RGCs) selected from publicly available ESTs derived from the B. napus defence reaction to inoculation with L. maculans. Allele-trait association studies were performed in a core set of 54 genetically diverse winter oilseed rape genotypes showing a broad spectrum of resistance/susceptibility to blackleg disease, and verified in independent breeding lines provided by participating breeding companies. Sequence-independent SNP-detection using specific primers was carried out via base-excision sequence scanning (BESS-T). SNPs are the most abundant form of genome variation. They can be used as simple genetic markers and are suitable for detection of associations between the allelic form and the phenotype. Therefore SNPs offer the opportunity to uncover allelic variation directly within sequences of candidate genes. In this study SNP data were used for association studies with L. maculans resistance/susceptibility data from field and greenhouse tests. Cloning of RGA and RGC sequences with significant associations to resistance data allowed the development of locus-specific PCR primers for interesting genes that could potentially be involved in different pathogen defense mechanisms, including hypesensitive reactions or systemic acquired resistance. In addition to the SNP data numerous SSR markers were found to be significantly associated to blackleg resistance in the genotype corset, as well as in different verification sets provided by participating rapeseed breeders. Many of the trait-associated SSR markers have been localised previously in B. napus genetic maps, so that their positions in the genome could be compared with known quantitative trait loci (QTL) for blackleg resistance. In some cases the resistance-associated SSR markers were found to be located in genome regions containing significant resistance QTL, therefore they represent promising candidates for marker-assisted selection of blackleg resistance. The resistance-associated SNP and SSR markers are suitable for high-throughput marker assisted selection in order to broaden the gene pool of winter oilseed rape by integration of novel allelic diversity for resistance against blackleg disease...|$|E
40|$|Resistance {{against the}} tomato fungal {{pathogen}} Cladosporium fulvum is often conferred by Hcr 9 genes iliomologues of the ~. fulvum resistance gene Cf-~) that {{are located in}} the Milky Way cluster on the short arm of Chromosome 1. These Hcr 9 genes mediate recognition of matching fungal avirulence gene products. In contrast, the resistance gene Cf-Ecp 2 mediates recognition of the pathogenicity factor Ecp 2 and is located in the Orlon (OR) cluster on the short arm of Chromosome 1. The main part of this thesis concentrates on the cloning of the Cf-Ecp 2 Orion (OR) cluster and the identification of the functional CfEcp 2 resistance gene that mediates HR-mediated resistance upon Ecp 2 recognition. In CHAPTER 2, we report the map- and homology-based cloning of the OR Hcr 9 cluster. A method was optimised to generate clone-specific fingerprint data that were subsequently used in the efficient establishment of genomic DNA contigs. Three Hcr 9 s were identified as candidate Cf-Ecp 2 genes. By PCR-based cloning using specific OR sequences, orthologous Hcr 9 genes were identified from different Lycopersicon species and haplotypes. The OR Hcr 9 s are very homologous to each other. However, based on a relative low sequence homology to other Hcr 9 s, the OR Hcr 9 s are classified as a new subgroup. As a consequence, the origin and the mode of action of this unique class of Hcr 9 s may differ from the other Hcr 9 s. To support allele mining, mapping, cloning and mRNA profiling of tomato Hcr 9 genes, a resistance <b>gene</b> <b>analogue</b> (RGA) fingerprint method was developed to generate novel Hcr 9 -specific markers (CHAPTER 3). The presence of both conserved and variable sequence domains in Hcr 9 s is exploited using a combination of PCR amplification and subsequent digestion. By the development of a fluorescent end-Iabelling method for restriction fragments, referred to as A/T labelling, high-resolution size-separation and detection of the complex RGA fingerprint pattern with a LlCOR automated sequencer became possible. The RGA fingerprint method was validated by the analysis of near-isogenic lines and the analysis of two Orlon (OR) Hcr 9 loci harbouring the Cf-Ecp 2 resistance gene or the recessive cf-ecp 2 allele. We identified several RGA-markers cosegregating with Cf-Ecp 2 resistance that corresponded to the th ree Hcr 9 s that are located at the OR locus. In addition, results indicate that the Hcr 9 RGA fingerprint method facilitates the discrimination of highly homologous genes in the analysis of a mapping population. Finally, the Hcr 9 RGA fingerprint method was applied to study the Hcr 9 gene expression and showed that two out of the three OR Hcr 9 s were expressed in planta. The various methods to identify the functional Cf-Ecp 2 gene are described in CHAPTER 4. Transient expression in Nicotiana species and complementation analysis in tomato were exploited to test candidate Cf-Ecp 2 genes for the ability to mediate Ecp 2 recognition. Despite applying all commonly used functional assays, {{we were not able to}} identify which of the three OR Hcr 9 represents the functional Cf-Ecp 2 gene. 8 ased on these results we have to conclude that recognition of the C. fulvum Ecp 2 elicitor is not solely mediated by an OR-Hcr 9 and an additional tomato-derived HR-stimulating factor is required for Cf-Ecp 2 /Ecp 2 mediated resistance. In addition to the three independent chapters on the cloning and identification of Cf-Ecp 2, two related research topics were investigated. Cladosporium fulvum is a fungal pathogen of tomato that grows exclusively in the intercellular spaces of leaves. In tomato, recognition of elicitors is followed by a hypersensitive response (HR) resulting in resistance. However, HR-associated recognition of Ecp 2 has also been observed in Nicotiana paniculata, N. sylvestris, N. tabacum and N. undulata that are non-host plants of C. fulvum (CHAPTER 5). Absence of Ecp 2 -recognition did not lead to growth of C. fulvum on Nicotiana plants. We show that HR-associated recognition of Ecp 2 is mediated by a single dominant gene in N. paniculata. However, based on PCR- and hybridisation analysis this gene is not homologous to known Cf-genes. DNA sequence analysis of the Avr proteins (so-called race-specific elicitors) Avr 2, Avr 4, Avr 4 E and Avr 9 have revealed that the change from a virulence to virulence is associated with DNA mutations in Avr coding regions. The high frequency of these mutations are most likely the result of high selection pressure caused by the frequent use of matching Cf resistance genes in commercial tomato lines. However, the Cf-Ecp resistance genes have rarely been employed and previous research showed that no variation was found the Ecp elicitors. In CHAPTER 6 the Ecotilling method was used in strains of C. fulvum that have been collected world-wide to compare the sequence variation in Avr and Ecp elicitor encoding genes while the variation in ribosomal internal transcribed spacers (lTS) was used as evolutionary clock. No polymorphisms in lTS sequences were observed. Silent mutations in Avrs occurred more frequently. However, the very fast majority of the mutations in Avr proteins were associated with virulence and indicate a high selection pressure in C. fulvum Avr elicitor genes. In Ecp elicitor genes, however, mutations occurred rarely and were not associated with virulence. These results show a very high mutation rate in elicitor proteins and confirms the lack of selection pressure on the Ecp genes by Cf-Ecp resistance genes. The thesis is concluded with a general discussion on Cf- and Cf-like proteins involved in disease resistance (CHAPTER 7). Current knowledge on the genetics and evolution of Cf genes, Cf protein characteristics, elicitor perception and signaI transduction in the tomato - C. fulvum pathosystem is discussed. In addition, the current knowledge on Cf-like proteins that are involved in other pathosystems is presented. Finally, this chapter describes some future directions in research on the described pathosystems...|$|E

However, disease resistance is known in some mango cultivars and is a desirable trait that can be utilized for developing mango varieties resistant to malformation. Resistance genes cloned from different plant species have revealed several similarities in DNA sequence and structural motifs. This provides the possibility of isolating resistance genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with degenerate oligonucleotide primers designed from highly conserved regions of the nucleotide binding site (NBS). In the present study, we used eight combinations of oligonucleotide primers designed on the basis of P-loop and hydrophobic domains of conserved NBS-leucine rich repeat (LRR) protein sequences for amplifying resistance <b>gene</b> <b>analogues</b> (RGAs) in eight mango cultivars and hybrids showing a variable degree of resistance to mango malformation disease. A single band of about 500 bp in all mango cultivars was obtained from the s 2 +as 2 primer combination. RGAs isolated from mango showed 73 % similarity with RGAs in databases. It confirms that RGAs were actually isolated from mango. The obtained sequence can be used for isolating full length R-genes...|$|R

In this study, to investigate the reaction of wheat genotypes (grouped into two cold and warm season genotypes), they were evaluated for infection to common and dwarf bunts during 2007 and 2008 cropping seasons. Plant materials were groups of wheat genotypes included 82 and 158 genotypes from the cold and warm areas which were assessed in this study. For present study, wheat seeds were inoculated by common and dwarf bunts teliospores before planting, and sowing was accomplished during fall season of 2007 and 2008 at Ghamlou and Saral experimental stations. At maturity time, the percentage of infected heads and the main reactions were determined. Results revealed that resistance of genotypes to dwarf bunt was higher than common bunt and also bunt incidence of durum genotypes was relatively lower than bread wheat genotypes.

The objectives of this study were to 1) design primers and develop PCR-based markers from disease-related expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and resistance <b>gene</b> <b>analogues</b> (RGAs), 2) assess the utility of such markers by diversity analysis of 12 soybean parental lines, and 3) search for possible association of the markers with known disease resistance genes by constructing a linkage map. The diversity analysis will allow this study to determine how well each marker can distinguish genotypes in soybean. Identifying the location of our markers in the soybean genome with the linkage map, will allow those related to disease resistance to be selected. A total of 202 simple sequence length polymorphism (SSLP) markers were constructed using a set of 1218 disease-related ESTs. Furthermore, 22 markers were constructed using previously identified RGA sequences. Both sets of markers were able to detect polymorphism in the diversity analysis.

40|$|Plants combat their {{pathogens}} with {{an array}} of defense responses. One of the key mechanisms involves products of resistance (R) genes which are responsible for recognition of effector molecules from pathogens and subsequent triggering of defense responses. Resistance <b>gene</b> <b>analogues</b> (RGAs) containing the specific conserved domains of R-genes are isolated from various plants using degenerate oligonucleotide primer based PCR approach. In an earlier study, RGPM 301 an RGA from pearl millet shown to be involved in resistance mechanism against downy mildew disease was isolated and characterized. In the present study, RGPM 301 containing an open reading frame (ORF) of 992 amino acids was cloned into pRSET A expression vector and expressed in Escherichia coli as a Hig-tag fusion protein. The recombinant RGA RGPM 301 was purified to near homogeneity using the Nickel-CL agarose column. Its molecular mass was found to be 120 kDa when separated on the SDS-PAGE which was confirmed by western blotting analysis using the anti-His antibody. The purified protein was subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion followed by mass spectrometric analysis for the confirmation of its identity.

L.) resistance response was studied in four chickpea genotypes, including resistant, moderately resistant, susceptible and wild relative (Cicer echinospermum L.) genotypes. The experimental system minimized environmental effects and was conducted in reference design, in which samples from mock-inoculated controls acted as reference against post-inoculation samples. Robust data quality was achieved through the use of three biological replicates (including a dye swap), the inclusion of negative controls and strict selection criteria for differentially expressed genes, including a fold change cut-off determined by self-self hybridizations, Student&# 039;s t-test and multiple testing correction (P < 0. 05). Microarray observations were also validated by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The time course expression patterns of 756 microarray features resulted in the differential expression of 97 genes in at least one genotype at one time point. k-means clustering grouped the genes into clusters of similar observations for each genotype, and comparisons between A. rabiei-resistant and A. rabiei-susceptible genotypes revealed potential gene &# 039;signatures&# 039; predictive of effective A. rabiei resistance...|$|R
40|$|Synthetic {{biology is}} facilitating novel methods and {{components}} {{to build in}} vivo and in vitro circuits to better understand and re-engineer biological networks. Recently, Kim and Winfree have synthesized a remarkably elegant network of transcriptional oscillators in vitro using a modular architecture of synthetic <b>gene</b> <b>analogues</b> and a few enzymes that, in turn, {{could be used to}} drive a variety of downstream circuits and nanodevices. However, these oscillators are sensitive to initial conditions and downstream load processes. Furthermore, the oscillations are not sustained since the inherently closed design suffers from enzyme deactivation, NTP fuel exhaustion, and waste product build up. In this paper, we show that a partially open architecture in which an adaptive controller, implemented inside an in silico computer that resides outside the wet-lab apparatus, can ensure sustained tunable oscillations in two specific designs of the Kim–Winfree oscillator networks. We consider two broad cases of operation: (1) the oscillator network operating in isolation and (2) the oscillator network driving a DNA tweezer subject to a variable load. In both scenarios, our simulation results show a significant improvement in the tunability and robustness of these oscillator networks. Our approach can be easily adopted to improve the loading capacity {{of a wide range of}} synthetic biological devices...|$|R
40|$|The nucleotide-binding site (NBS) leucine-rich repeat (LRR) {{gene family}} is a class of R genes in plants. NBS genes play a very {{important}} role in disease defence. To further study the variation and homology of mango NBSLRR genes, 16 resistance <b>gene</b> <b>analogues</b> (RGAs) (GenBank accession number HM 446507 - 22) were isolated from the polymerase chain reaction fragments and sequenced by using two degenerate primer sets. The total nucleotide diversity index Pi was 0. 362, and 236 variation sites were found among 16 RGAs. The degree of homology between the RGAs varied from 44. 4 % to 98. 5 %. Sixteen RGAs could be translated into amino sequences. The high level of this homology in the protein sequences of the P-loop and kinase- 2 of the NBS domain between the RGAs isolated in this study and previously characterized R genes indicated that these cloned sequences belonged to the NBSLRR gene family. Moreover, these 16 RGAs could be classified into the non-TIRNBSLRR gene family because only tryptophan (W) could be claimed as the final residual of the kinase- 2 domain of all RGAs isolated here. From our results, we concluded that our mango NBSLRR genes possessed a high level of variation from the mango genome, which may allow mango to recognize many different pathogenic virulence factors...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis was the elucidation of the host-pathogen interaction between Pinus patula and Fusarium circinatum. This was accomplished by studying differential gene expression at the molecular level. Therefore, the first chapter reports the use of PCR-based methods in gene discovery and transcriptome analysis. The use of these techniques {{in the identification of}} novel transcripts in host-pathogen interactions addressed. These examples illustrate the differences and strong features of each technique. Chitinases are linked to defence responses in plants. In chapter tw 0, the induction of chitinases in P. patula was assessed at both the protein and genetic level. Western blot analysis and enzyme activity assays indicate that chitinase enzyme is not detected a part of the defence response by P. patula after infection by F. circinatum. This was further confirmed by the lack of significant induction of two Pinus chitinase genes, LP 6 and PSCHI 4, as determined by RT-PCR analysis. Partial DNA sequence homologues for the LP 6 and PSCH 14 genes were determined and compared with a variety of plant chitinases. The low levels of detectable chitinase induction in P. patula might explain the high levels of susceptibility to the pitch canker fungus observed in seedlings of this tree. Pinus patula, the most widely planted species in South Africa, is highly susceptible to infection by F. circinatum. In chapter three, suppression subtractive hybridisation was used to elucidate the changes taking place at the molecular level early on in this interaction. Most of the identified transcripts shared homology to both biotic and abiotic stress in plants. The induction of one fragment, displaying homology to phytocyanin proteins, as followed through RT-PCR. Induction levels for this fragment differed significantly between less and more susceptible plants. Although most of the sequences isolated in this study can be Iiked to stress, most have not been linked with specific plant-pathogen interactions. This raises questions in regard to the function of these genes in host-pathogen interactions. Further research identify the function of these sequences in the defence response will be needed. These sequences can also be tested against a family of Pinus trees to ascertain if they will be useful in marker assisted selection. A molecular analysis of culture degeneration and pathogenicity of F. circinatum was attempted in chapter four. In this chapter, the differential induction of transcripts in F. circinatum was determined against several other Fusarium spp. Several of he identified fragments shared homology with stress related proteins. One transcript shared homology to a polyketide synthase, FUM 5, that could be linked to fumonisin production in other Fusarium spp. ELISA detected no fumonisin production, although the FUM 5 transcripts were detected. The identification of all the transcripts could provide a basis for more intensive gene discovery studies in F. circinatum and other Fusarium spp. The induction of these sequences in different isolates needs to be studied to prove their function in F. circinatum. This study also complements several other studies that studied the morphological characteristics of culture degeneration. Resistance <b>gene</b> <b>analogues</b> have been reported from a diverge set of plant species. In chapter five, degenerate PCR amplification was used to isolate TI-NBS-LRR like resistance <b>gene</b> <b>analogues</b> from a range of Pinus species. These sequences w re further characterised through comparative analysis with previously reported Pinus resistance <b>gene</b> <b>analogues.</b> Through motif analysis, several of the known conserved motifs found in NBS domains were identified and conservation with other plant NBS motifs is indicated. The P-Ioop and GLPL motifs displayed a high level of conservation on amino acid level with other plant NBS motifs. However, slight differences in several of the conserved regions were observed when the Pinus analogues were compared with Arabidopsis thaliana. The identification of differences between angiosperm and gymnosperm NBS sequences indicates that design of new degenerate probes and primers for the isolation of more ancient NBS sequences is needed. Further, phylogenetic and structural analyses of these sequences will also aid in understanding the relationship between angiosperm and gymnosperm NBS sequences. The knowledge gained from such a study will highlight the similarities between angiosperm and gymnosperm defence responses. This study represents the first detailed report on RGA in Pinus.

Resistance to powdery mildew (Rmd-c), Phytophthora stem and root rot (Rps 2), and an ineffective nodulation gene (Rj 2) map within this cluster. BAC fingerprinting and RGA-specific primers were used to develop a contig of BAC clones spanning this region in cultivar "Williams 82 " [rps 2, Rmd (adult onset), rj 2]. Two cDNAs with homology to the TIR/NBD/LRR family of R-genes have also been mapped to opposite ends of a BAC in the contig Gm_Isb 001 _ 091 F 11 (BAC 91 F 11). Sequence analyses of BAC 91 F 11 identified 16 different resistance-like gene (RLG) sequences with homology to the TIR/NBD/LRR family of disease resistance genes. Four of these RLGs represent two potentially novel classes of disease resistance genes: TIR/NBD domains fused inframe to a putative defense-related protein (NtPRp 27 -like) and TIR domains fused inframe to soybean calmodulin Ca(2 +) -binding domains. RT-PCR analyses using gene-specific primers allowed us to monitor the expression of individual genes in different tissues and developmental stages. Three genes appeared to be constitutively expressed, while three were differentially expressed.
