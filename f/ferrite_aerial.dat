40|$|Electromagnetic {{radiation}} (EMR) {{as measured}} at {{the surface of the}} litho-sphere or underground shows preferred orientations, which can be related to mi-crocracks and other brittle structures at micro and nano scales (see Bahat et al. 2005 and references therein). During the last years, numerous studies showed the applicability of EMR measurements for the determination of active fractures and stress orientations. EMR is deter-mined with a ‘Cerescope’, which picks up EMR signals at frequencies from 5 – 50 kHz (Obermeyer, 2005) with a <b>ferrite</b> <b>aerial</b> and processes them electronically so that the results can be displayed on a screen or copied to a computer. With the help of oriented EMR mea-surements, intensity variations are de-termined, which can be related to pre-ferred crack fracture orientations. From this information, orientations of the principal stresses can be calculated. In addition, the intensity of the EMR is related to stress magnitudes. Sev-eral EMR measuring methods with the Cerescope can be applied to study re-gional and local stress fields. For hori-zontal measurements the aerial is moved in a horizontal circle. Every 5 degrees a measurement is taken. The entire hori-zontal measurement consists of 72 read-ings, which are illustrated in a polar di...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} article (reference 1), I made {{comparisons between the}} performance at 1. 8 MHz of the <b>ferrite</b> rod loop <b>aerial</b> and open frame loop aerials. Experiments were carried out using a ferrite rod 20 cm long by 9. 5 mm diameter and open loops 0. 8 m square. Generally speaking, the open loop aerials performed with signal sensitivity considerably better than the <b>ferrite</b> loop <b>aerial.</b> However, at frequencies below 100 kHz, I was able to achieve results which were essentially the reverse...|$|R
50|$|Some early bat {{detectors}} used ex Navy, {{low frequency}} radio sets, simply replacing the aerial with a microphone and pre-amplifier. It {{is also possible}} to modify a portable Long Wave radio to be a bat detector by adjusting the tuning frequencies and replacing the <b>ferrite</b> rod <b>aerial</b> with a microphone and pre-amplifier.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the RDF, the ADF {{operates}} without direct intervention, and continuously {{displays the}} direction of the tuned beacon. Initially, all ADF receivers, both marine and aircraft versions, contained a rotating loop or <b>ferrite</b> loopstick <b>aerial</b> driven by a motor which was controlled by the receiver. Like the RDF, a sense antenna verified the correct direction from its 180-degree opposite.|$|R
50|$|In modern radios, a ferrite {{loop antenna}} is used, {{consisting}} of fine wire wound on a ferrite rod. Litz wire {{is often used}} to reduce skin effect losses. The ferrite rod increases the magnetic permeability, allowing the physically small antenna to have a larger effective area. Other names for this type of antenna are loopstick antenna, ferrite rod antenna, <b>ferrite</b> rod <b>aerial,</b> Ferroceptor, or ferrod antenna.|$|R
5000|$|Other names include loopstick antenna, ferrod, and ferrite-rod antenna. [...] "Ferroceptor" [...] is {{an older}} {{alternative}} {{name for a}} <b>ferrite</b> rod <b>aerial,</b> particularly used by Philips where the ferrite core would be called a [...] "Ferroxcube" [...] rod (a brand name acquired by Yageo from Philips in the year 2000). The short terms ferrite rod or ‘loop-stick’ sometimes refers to the coil-plus-ferrite combination that {{takes the place of}} both an external antenna and the radio’s first tuned circuit, or just the ferrite core itself (the cylindrical rod or flat ferrite slab).|$|R
50|$|The {{first product}} {{launched}} was the RP10 Herald. In common {{with many of}} their 1960s designs, this was built into a wooden case covered in leathercloth, with foam padding under {{the front and rear}} panels and a turntable to enable the set to be rotated for best reception (the internal <b>ferrite</b> rod <b>aerial</b> being highly directional). It featured a large (5 inch by 8 inch) 30Ω loudspeaker, and was powered by two PP9 batteries. Initial sets used Ediswan transistors; later sets used Mullard devices, including the AF117, which unfortunately went on to suffer from tin whisker formation within the encapsulation.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ferrite</b> rod <b>aerials</b> (or antennae) are a type {{of small}} {{magnetic}} loop (SML) antenna very common in AM radio broadcast band transistor radios, although they began {{to be used in}} vacuum tube ("valve") radios in the 1950s. They are also useful in very low frequency (VLF) receivers, and can sometimes give good results over most of the shortwave frequencies assuming a suitable ferrite is used). They consist of a coil of wire wound around a ferrite rod core (usually several inches longer than the coil, but sometimes over 3 feet long). This core effectively ‘concentrates’ the magnetic field of the radio waves to give a stronger signal than could be obtained by an air core loop antenna of comparable size, although still not as strong as the signal that could be obtained with a good outdoor wire aerial.|$|R
50|$|Receiving antennas do {{not have}} to be as {{efficient}} as transmitting antennas since in this band the signal to noise ratio is determined by atmospheric noise. The noise floor in the receiver is far below the noise in the signal, so antennas small in comparison to the wavelength, which are inefficient and produce low signal strength, can be used. The most common receiving antenna is the ferrite loopstick antenna (also known as a <b>ferrite</b> rod <b>aerial),</b> made from a ferrite rod with a coil of fine wire wound around it. This antenna is small enough that it is usually enclosed inside the radio case. In addition to their use in AM radios, ferrite antennas are also used in portable radio direction finder (RDF) receivers. The ferrite rod antenna has a dipole reception pattern with sharp nulls along the axis of the rod, so that reception is at its best when the rod is at right angles to the transmitter, but fades to nothing when the rod points exactly at the transmitter. Other types of loop antennas and random wire antennas are also used.|$|R
