This tannery was located in Greenville, Ohio that {{his father had}} {{previously}} seen. When they arrived at the tannery the next morning, Lambert was disappointed to find that the building had burned to the ground the night before. He searched amongst the ashes and found the burned Otto <b>gas</b> <b>engine.</b> This was the only one he had ever heard of or seen. He took it apart to see how it was constructed. It was a slide valve coal <b>gas</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E

And contribution of application of <b>gas</b> <b>engines</b> on the reduction of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions as well as harmful emissions is estimated. Since <b>gas</b> <b>engines</b> are different from conventional internal combustion engines on fuel system and combustion system, the key technologies relating to developing <b>gas</b> <b>engines</b> are introduced, and the major difficulties of popularizing of <b>gas</b> <b>engines</b> are discussed. With the foundation of {{the analysis}}, development strategy of <b>gas</b> <b>engines</b> is proposed...|$|R

25|$|Ashby's Mill {{was built}} in 1816 and worked by wind until 1862, when the {{business}} was transferred to a watermill at Mitcham on the River Wandle.

This was later replaced by a <b>gas</b> <b>engine.</b> The windmill was worked by engine until 1934, and supplied wholemeal flour to West End hotels and restaurants.|$|E
25|$|Motorized fire engines did {{not become}} commonplace until the early 20th century.

That same year, the Knox Automobile Company of Springfield, Massachusetts, began selling what some have described as the world's first modern fire engine. A year later, the city of Springfield, Illinois, had filled their fire department with Knox engines.|$|E

25|$|Biogas from {{sewage sludge}} {{treatment}} is sometimes {{used to run}} a <b>gas</b> <b>engine</b> to produce electrical power, {{some or all of}} which can be used to run the sewage works. Some waste heat from the engine is then used to heat the digester. The waste heat is, in general, enough to heat the digester to the required temperatures. The power potential from sewage works is limited – in the UK, there are about 80MW total of such generation, with the potential to increase to 150MW, which is insignificant compared to the average power demand in the UK of about 35,000MW. The scope for biogas generation from nonsewage waste biological matter – energy crops, food waste, abattoir waste, etc. - is much higher, estimated to be capable of about 3,000MW. Farm biogas plants using animal waste and energy crops are expected to contribute to reducing CO2 emissions and strengthen the grid, while providing UK farmers with additional revenues.|$|E
25|$|The 1901 to 1904 Oldsmobile Curved Dash was {{the first}} mass-produced car, made from the first {{automotive}} assembly line, an invention that is often miscredited to Henry Ford and the Ford Motor Company. (Ford {{was the first}} to manufacture cars on a moving assembly line.) After Olds merged Olds Motor Vehicle Co. with the Olds <b>Gas</b> <b>Engine</b> Works in 1899, it was renamed Olds Motor Works and moved to a new plant in Detroit, located at the corner of East Jefferson Avenue and MacArthur Bridge. By March 1901, the company had a whole line of models ready for mass production. However, a mistake by a worker caused the factory to catch fire, and it burned to the ground, with all of the prototypes destroyed. The only car that survived the fire was a Curved Dash prototype, which was wheeled out of the factory by two workers while escaping the fire. A new factory was built in Lansing, and production of the Curved Dash commenced.|$|E

Although {{the engine was}} {{intended}} for use on a small boat, Haynes believed it could be adapted for his purposes. The [...] engine arrived {{in the fall of}} 1893. Haynes soon had the device attached to a carriage he built in his kitchen. He found when he started the engine that its vibrations were too severe for the harness it was in, and before he could stop the engine it had done considerable damage to the carriage and the floor of his kitchen, and filled the room with smoke.|$|E

5000|$|Heavy-duty lean-burn <b>gas</b> <b>engines</b> admit {{twice as}} much [...] air than {{theoretically}} needed for complete combustion into the combustion chambers. The extremely weak air-fuel mixtures lead to lower combustion temperatures and therefore lower NOx formation. While lean-burn <b>gas</b> <b>engines</b> offer higher theoretical thermal efficiencies, transient response and performance may be compromised in certain situations. However, advances in fuel control and closed loop technology by companies like North American Repower have led to production of modern CARB certified lean burn heavy duty engines for use in commercial vehicle fleets. Lean-burn <b>gas</b> <b>engines</b> are almost always turbocharged, resulting in high power and torque figures not achievable with stoichiometric engines due to high combustion temperatures.|$|R
500|$|Pinchbeck South Fen is {{a region}} {{covering}} [...] {{lying on the}} west side of Vernatt's Drain. It was originally managed as the Fourth District by the Deeping Fen trustees, but was independent in 1828, when the occupants approached the trustees with a plan to drain some of the water from the fen to the Pode Hole pumps. A tunnel already existed under Vernatt's drain, and so the trustees agreed. However, the charges levied by the trustees for this service rose dramatically, so that the South Fen residents decided to build their own pumping engine at Pode Hole in 1830. A Fenton & Murray beam engine driving a [...] scoop wheel was installed, at a cost of £3,000, which was considerably less than the charge the trustees wanted to make. The engine was replaced by a suction <b>gas</b> <b>engine</b> and Ruston pump in 1919, which was decommissioned in 1943 when a Petter oil engine with a [...] Gwynnes pump was installed. This only lasted for ten years, as two electric motors driving [...] and [...] pumps were fitted in 1953.|$|E
