40|$|The {{labor market}} is a key aspect of {{democracy}} and the country's economy, {{it is part of}} human life that affect us all the time linked to the economic and social aspects such as standard of living, class, identity, welfare etc. Labor market policy results in policies that are used to increase employment and thus reducing unemployment and improving labor market functioning. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore and describe how the implementation of labor market policy measures goes to and how much leeway <b>employment</b> <b>agents</b> on AF (arbetsförmedlingen) in Västerås have. We have chosen both quantitative and qualitative methods in our study. First we did a quantitative survey where we had a questionnaire survey with agents employed at the AF in Västerås. In terms of qualitative approach, we did a half - structured interview with the employment office manager in Västerås, where we used the same questions that we had the quantitative survey. This will also help us to detect if street-level bureaucrats and top officials (bureaucrats) have different perceptions / views regarding how much leeway <b>employment</b> <b>agents</b> on AF in Västerås have...|$|R

40|$|The {{necessity}} {{to adapt the}} organizational structure of economic operators to the competitive European market requirements has imposed measures that have also influenced labor relations. The permanent and full-time employment relationship has been largely replaced by other types of more flexible labor relationships: temporary employment, part-time work. working from home and temporary assignment through an employment agency. All these types of work relationships are characterized by a decrease of guarantees for the employee and by a reduction of trade union power. Thus, they are considered atypical work relationships. The {{need to make the}} flexibility of labor relationships compatible with the protection of employees” rights has been a challenge that must be faced by social policies and also by labor law. In this context, the use of a temporary <b>employment</b> <b>agent</b> has been a tool for flexible working relationships both with the economic operators and within the labor market as a whole. The importane and role of this type of working relationship has, therefore, acquired significant legal, economic and social dimensions, which this study intends to analyze. In a European economy hit by the jobs crisis, reliance on work through a temporary <b>employment</b> <b>agent</b> can be a way to reduce unemployment. This happens only if the temporary workers benefit from legal protection and equal treatment as permanent employees...|$|R

Our intelligent <b>employment</b> <b>agent</b> is described as an example of systems capable of userfriendly natural-language communication in two languages. The system was developed with reasonable resources on the Internet, and has been used by millions of users despite critical estimates about Internet applications...|$|R

5000|$|A {{prominent}} {{difference between}} agents and managers under California state law is that licensed talent <b>agents</b> and <b>employment</b> <b>agents</b> {{are the only}} entities legally allowed to seek {{work on behalf of}} their clients. [...] This legal distinction has enabled artists such as the Deftones, Pamela Anderson, Nia Vardalos, Freddie Prinze Jr., and others to break contracts with their managers and avoid commissions owed according to those contracts by proving [...] "unlicensed procurement" [...] in court. Because the enforcement against talent managers procuring work is largely carried out through civil litigation and not criminal penalties, managers directly seek out work in defiance of state laws, as clients out of self-interest will seldom object to them doing so and cases alleging illegal procurement are infrequent.|$|R

5|$|As {{the players}} empire expands, agents and {{supervisors}} will make themselves available for <b>employment.</b> <b>Agents</b> {{are used for}} gathering intelligence on alien asteroids and can also be deployed on the players own asteroids for counter-intelligence. Other uses for agents include deploying APV's and destroying various buildings such as defense installations, life support, production, and other various installations. The chances of an agent successfully completing their mission and escaping detection are increased {{if there is a}} spy satellite orbiting the asteroid they are assigned to. Colony Supervisors are able to be employed to help manage the building and maintenance of asteroid colonies. There is no research in the game, as this popular mechanic is replaced with the Sci-Tek blueprint system which allows players to buy new technologies as needed.

This study consists of a qualitative study in the form of semi-structured interviews. These interviews were conducted at the Employment Service in a small Swedish town, where six <b>employment</b> <b>agents</b> of different ages participated in the survey. The results of the study show that education, planning discussions and reflective time are the most relevant aspects of the work situation of the six respondents who participated in the survey. These appeared most frequent during the interviews and the respondents emphasized the importance of education, planning discussions and reflective time. Respondents felt that the skills and competence are important aspects of the work situation and is available for employees within the organization. There exist in some situations, an ambivalence about how age is significant in the workplace. Respondents believe that sometimes age does not matter but the latter stresses situations where it is important with age balance.

Furthermore, we have touched on what it is that makes employees feel satisfied with their job and workplace, and also stay in the organization. The study was conducted on one of Arbetsförmedlingen’s offices in northern Sweden and the informants consisted of six <b>employment</b> <b>agents,</b> an executive assistant and a head of division. The result of the study has been analyzed using theories within the field of career development. Most of the informants have conveyed a positive description of their development opportunities and believe {{that it is possible to}} advance vertically as well as horizontally, and within their current role. However, differences were found among the informants regarding the importance of career. In addition several informants believe that the level of stress in the workplace is a problem and that Arbetsförmedlingen should do more to prevent stress. ...|$|R

50|$|The White Rose Mission (also {{known as}} the White Rose Home for Colored Working Girls and the White Rose Industrial Association) was created on February 11, 1897 as a “Christian, nonsectarian Home for Colored Girls and Women” by African American civic leaders, Victoria Earle Matthews (1861-1907) and Maritcha Remond Lyons (1848-1929). The {{settlement}} house, located on Manhattan's Upper West side in the neighborhood known then as San Juan Hill, was founded to offer refuge, shelter and food for newly arrived African American /Colored women from the southern United States and the West Indies. Aware of the perilous conditions for young African American women seeking work in New York City, Matthews and Lyons and other volunteers working with The White Rose Mission met incoming vessels. At Manhattan’s piers, docks and railway stations, volunteers offered assistance to female travelers who often fell prey to unscrupulous <b>employment</b> <b>agents</b> and con artists. As traveler’s assistance services were generally not available to African American women, the White Rose Mission, {{under the direction of}} Victoria Earle Matthews, was founded to address the specific problems facing African American female migrants.|$|R
