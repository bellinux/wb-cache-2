Flagella and cilia are {{sometimes referred to}} as undulipodia, and are variously involved in movement, feeding, and sensation. They are composed mainly of tubulin. These are entirely distinct from prokaryotic flagellae. They are supported by a bundle of microtubules arising from a basal body, also called a <b>kinetosome</b> or centriole, characteristically arranged as nine doublets surrounding two singlets.

40|$|We {{review the}} {{literature}} on centrioles, <b>kinetosomes,</b> and other microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs) in animal, plant, and protist cells {{in the context of}} the Henneguy-Lenhossék theory of 1899. This 100 -year-old cytological theory, valid today, defines centrioles and <b>kinetosomes</b> as identical, homologous but developmentally distinguishable structures. Centrioles (paired constituents of mitotic centrosomes in animal cells) become <b>kinetosomes</b> (ciliary basal bodies) when their 9 (2) + 2 microtubular axonemes grow outward. During mitosis in Chlamydomonas, the <b>kinetosomes</b> are segregated at the poles of the mitotic spindle. Mitotic centrioles function as organelles of motility in many protists, though nowhere is this centriole-kinetosome relation more clearly seen than in the karyomastigont structure (kinetosome-nucleus-Golgi complex organellar system) of the trichomonads and other amitochondriate parabasalids. Constituent sequences of mitotic spindle-centriole-kinetosome proteins (γ-tubulin, pericentrin, and the cyclin-dependent kinases Cdc 2 and Cdc 3, members of the centrin family) are conserved across taxa, occurring in animal and protist centrioles, plant MTOCs, and fungal spindle pole bodies.

A minute chytrid found colonizing pollen grains had zoospore ultrastructure and a sequence of the large subunit ribosomal rRNA gene different from the molecular constitution of 22 isolates in the core Rhizophydium clade. Unlike typical Rhizophydium zoospores, the zoospore of Kappamyces laurelensis gen. et sp. nov. lacked a rumposome, kinetosome-associated electron-opaque spur, and kinetosome-associated microtubular root.

40|$|Euplotes eurystomus bears 8 rows of single, non-motile simple cilia, 18 ventral cirri, and {{a row of}} adoral membranelles. Each cirrus {{contains}} 40 - 120 cilia {{in tight}} hexagonal packing, and each membranelle consists of 3 rows of 10 - 40 cilia; the component cilia adhere together in life, but no means of adhesion, other than small protuberances of the ciliary membrane, has been seen. The <b>kinetosomes</b> of compound organelles, but not of the simple cilia, are associated with rootlet fibres. The <b>kinetosomes</b> of the component cilia of compound organelles are linked together at two levels by characteristic arrays of fibres.

40|$|The {{electron}} microscope {{was used to}} study the structure and three dimensional relationships {{of the components of}} the body cortex in thin sections of Paramecium multimicronucleatum. Micrographs of sections show that the cortex is covered externally by two closely apposed membranes (together ∼ 250 A thick) constituting the pellicle. Beneath the pellicle the surface of the animal is molded into ridges that form a polygonal ridgework with depressed centers. It is these ridges that give the surface of the organism its characteristic configuration and correspond to the outer fibrillar system of the light microscope image. The outer ends of the trichocysts with their hood-shaped caps are located in the centers of the anterior and posterior ridges of each polygon. The cilia extend singly from the depressed centers of the surface polygons. Each cilium shows two axial filaments with 9 peripheral and parallel filaments embedded in a matrix and the whole surrouned by a thin ciliary membrane. The 9 peripheral filaments are double and these are evenly spaced in a circle around the central pair. The ciliary membrane is continuous with the outer member of the pellicular membrane, whereas the plasma membrane is continuous with the inner member of the pellicular membrane. At the level of the plasma membrane the proximal end of the cilium is continuous with its tube-shaped basal body or <b>kinetosome.</b> The peripheral filaments of the cilium, together with the material of cortical matrix which tends to condense around them, form the sheath of the basal body. The kinetodesma connecting the ciliary kinetosomes (inner fibrillar system of the light microscopist) is composed of a number of discrete fibrils which overlap in a shingle-like fashion. Each striated kinetosomal fibril originates from a ciliary <b>kinetosome</b> and runs parallel to other kinetosomal fibrils arising from posterior kinetosomes of a particular meridional array. Sections {{at the level of the}} ciliary kinetosomes reveal an additional fiber system, the infraciliary lattice system, which is separate and distinct from the kinetodesmal system. This system consists of a fibrous network of irregular polygons and runs roughly parallel to the surface of the animal. Mitochondria have a fine structure similar in general features to that described for a number of mammalian cell types, but different in certain details. The structures corresponding to cristae mitochondriales appear as finger-like projections or microvilli extending into the matrix of the organelle from the inner membrane of the paired mitochondrial membrane. The cortical cytoplasm contains also a particulate component and a system of vesicles respectively comparable to the nucleoprotein particles and to the endoplasmic reticulum described in various metazoan cell types. An accessory <b>kinetosome</b> has been observed in oblique sections of a number of non-dividing specimens slightly removed from the ciliary <b>kinetosome</b> and on the same meridional line as the cilia and trichocysts.

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Stentors {{treated with}} toxic {{substances}} can be induced to shed their oral bands (19, Fig. 1), complex structures composed of many cilia organized into membranelles. Regenerating membranellar bands {{were observed in}} control stentors removed from toxic (urea-containing) medium at about 3. 5 hours. At 8 hours regenerated control organisms were indistinguishable from normal unshed stentors. Experimental animals replaced into colchicine medium were inhibited from regeneration at low, nontoxic concentrations of this mitotic spindle inhibitor. Upon removal of the colchicine and replacement of the shed animals into normal medium or normal medium to which GTP had been added, complete and normal regeneration of the membranellar band ensued. Our observations are consistent with many suggesting that colchicine acts by reversibly binding with a protein during processes involving microtubule formation. Colchicine inhibition of membranellar band formation further indicates that oral membranelles are specialized evolutionary homologs to other centriole (= basal body, = <b>kinetosome)</b> derivatives such as mitotic spindle fibers, cilia and flagella, axopods, etc. (structures containing the ubiquitous microtubules of eukaryotic cells) ...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{testable}} {{model for the}} origin of the nucleus, the membrane-bounded organelle that defines eukaryotes. A chimeric cell evolved via symbiogenesis by syntrophic merger between an archaebacterium and a eubacterium. The archaebacterium, a thermoacidophil resembling extant Thermoplasma, generated hydrogen sulfide to protect the eubacterium, a heterotrophic swimmer comparable to Spirochaeta or Hollandina that oxidized sulfide to sulfur. Selection pressure for speed swimming and oxygen avoidance led to an ancient analogue of the extant cosmopolitan bacterial consortium "Thiodendron latens. " By eubacterial-archaebacterial genetic integration, the chimera, an amitochondriate heterotroph, evolved. This "earliest branching protist" that formed by permanent DNA recombination generated the nucleus as a component of the karyomastigont, an intracellular complex that assured genetic continuity of the former symbionts. The karyomastigont organellar system, common in extant amitochondriate protists as well as in presumed mitochondriate ancestors, minimally consists of a single nucleus, a single <b>kinetosome</b> and their protein connector. As predecessor of standard mitosis, the karyomastigont preceded free (unattached) nuclei. The nucleus evolved in karyomastigont ancestors by detachment at least five times (archamoebae, calonymphids, chlorophyte green algae, ciliates, foraminifera).

40|$|International audienceThe human {{parasite}} Trichomonas vaginalis has specific structural bodies, atractophores, associated {{at one end}} to the <b>kinetosomes</b> and at {{the other}} to the spindle during division. A monoclonal antibody specific for a component of this structure was obtained. It recognizes a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 477 kDa. Sequence analysis of this protein shows that P 477 belongs to the family of large coiled-coil proteins, sharing a highly versatile protein folding motif adaptable to many biological functions. P 477 -might act as an anchor to localize cellular activities and components to the golgi centrosomal region. It may represent a new class of structural proteins, since similar proteins were found in many protozoans...|$|R
