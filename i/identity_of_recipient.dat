It is poorly understood, however, whether these two disturbances interact with the functional <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>recipient</b> native plants to drive community change. We performed a mesocosm experiment to examine whether the interactive effects of invasion by a stoloniferous turf-grass Stenotaphrum secundatum and nutrient enrichment vary across different plant growth forms of an endangered coastal plant community.

Little is known, however, about whether the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>recipient</b> either the parent or child can inuence the e¤ectiveness of these interventions. This study provides an empirical test of whether changing {{the recipient of the}} incentive a¤ects outcomes. To structure the test, I develop a model of household education production in which parentsability to motivate their children is dampened because of moral hazard. In the model, when parental inputs are more productive, rewarding parents is more e¤ective than rewarding children, while the opposite is true when child inputs are more productive. A testable prediction is that the relative e¤ectiveness of rewarding the parent rather than the child should be positively correlated with the part of the childs prior achievement that is predicted by parental characteristics. I test the model with a 8 ̆ 5 eld experiment in Gurgaon, India where an incentive to achieve a speci 8 ̆ 5 c reading goal was randomly assigned to be received by either the parent or by the child.

40|$|For {{several decades}} law and {{economic}} scholars have employed {{the tools of}} price theory in order to evaluate an array of legal questions ranging from criminal sanctions to contract remedies. This vast body of literature implicitly assumed that all payments made through the legal system are fungible. In other words, just as a dollar paid for a tomato is identical to a dollar paid for a cucumber, so are a dollar paid as a pollution tax {{to the government and}} a dollar paid as compensation to the party injured by the pollution. In this study we challenge this assumption, and present empirical evidence that documents systematic and consistent differences between distinct types of legal payments. We used a sample of 420 students who received a description of a hypothetical scenario that involved the behavior of an owner of a factory that creates a negative externality in its production process. We then manipulated the legal regime that participants were subject to along three dimensions: timing of payment (ex-ante v. ex post), <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>recipient</b> (state vs. injured party), and the level of certainty (certain vs. probable), and compared the way participants perceived the situation using an array of psychological variables. Our findings indicate that there is a continuum of legal payments that are perceived differently by people, and as a result generate distinct incentives. At one end of this continuum lie legal payments that are similar in structure to a paradigmatic price. These are payments made to another private party in advance. At {{the other end of the}} continuum lie legal payments that are similar in structure to the paradigmatic punishment. These are payments that are made after the fact to the state, and that their assessment is probabilistic. The analysis presented in the paper offers a significant contribution to current scholarly work in fields such as criminal law, tort law, law enforcement, and environmental regulation. For example, our findings indicate that shifting to a system of pollution taxes might transform the way in which polluters treat the price the law sets for their activity. Furthermore, the framework we introduce in this study can be extended to a wide range of empirical studies that will help broaden our understanding of the social meaning of legal dollars...|$|E

40|$|Most of the {{existing}} multi-recipient signcryption schemes do not take the anonymity <b>of</b> <b>recipients</b> into consideration because the list <b>of</b> the <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> all <b>recipients</b> must {{be included in the}} ciphertext as a necessary element for decryption. Although the signer’s anonymity has been taken into account in several alternative schemes, these schemes often suffer from the cross-comparison attack and joint conspiracy attack. That is to say, there are few schemes that can achieve complete anonymity for both the signer and the recipient. However, in many practical applications, such as network conference, both the signer’s and the recipient’s anonymity should be considered carefully. Motivated by these concerns, we propose a novel multi-recipient signcryption scheme with complete anonymity. The new scheme can achieve both the signer’s and the recipient’s anonymity at the same time. Each recipient can easily judge whether the received ciphertext is from an authorized source, but cannot determine the real <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> the sender, and at the same time, each participant can easily check decryption permission, but cannot determine the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> any other <b>recipient.</b> The scheme also provides a public verification method which enables anyone to publicly verify the validity of the ciphertext. Analyses show that the proposed scheme is more efficient in terms of computation complexity and ciphertext length and possesses more advantages than existing schemes, which makes it suitable for practical applications.

40|$|Research {{has shown}} that both the support of {{anonymity}} {{and the use of}} appropriate incentives can lead to improved group performance. Anonymity enables a more open discussion resulting in a more critical analysis of a problem. Rewards can motivate individuals to cooperate, giving them the incentive to share valuable information with the group. Unfortunately, these two mechanisms are both dependent on the ability to identify the contributor. Anonymity hides the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> the contributor, while the support of individualized, performance-based rewards requires the rewarding agent to be able to determine the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> the contributor. This contradictory requirement has prevented the simultaneous used of anonymity and performance-based rewards in decision making. Using group decision support systems as a basis, this work identifies procedures to simultaneously support participant anonymity and performance-based rewards. Mechanisms based on public key encryption technologies are presented which make it possible to distribute individual rewards to anonymous contributors, guarantee that only the contributor can claim a reward for her contribution, verify that a reward has been distributed, and be able to deliver this reward {{in such a way that}} the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> the anonymous contributor is protected.

40|$|Late medieval English chronicles contain several puzzling {{references}} {{to the idea of}} people ›becoming English‹ by changing allegiance, usually in the context of war. How does this fit in with the predominantly ›racial‹ understanding of nationhood that permeated late-medieval English literary texts and official rhetoric, based on well-established ideas about birth, blood and heredity? These assumptions provided a powerfully persistent backdrop to late- medieval English writers’ constructions <b>of</b> national <b>identity</b> and culture, which had an impact not only in literary spheres but also on government rhetoric and policy. Was it possible for a person to change nationality by changing sides? It is argued that these scattered re ferences by certain chroniclers to ›becoming‹ English, French or Scottish refer not to an actual change in nationality as a legal and political status but act as a shorthand way of describing an anomalous change of political allegiance. Such instances of changing sides went against the grain of the political behaviour expected from a person born into a certain nationality but they did not change that nationality, which was associated with blood and birth. The essay goes on to examine the language of denization, by which foreigners were granted the legal rights and privileges of a native-born English person. From a close examination of the range of Latin vocabulary used in official documents, it is argued that even denization did not effect a change in the perceived nationality <b>of</b> the <b>recipient,</b> but only allowed for them to be treated as if they were English, in certain circumstances. Moreover, this new legal status did not automatically remove the alien social and cultural <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>recipients</b> in the eyes of local political society, particularly at times of political tension such as the Glyn Dŵr revolt in Wales or outbreaks of war with France. By teasing out the implications of these puzzling uses of language and terminology, it is possible to refine and complicate our understanding of the intersection of ideas about race, subject-hood, allegiance, and nationality in both the texts and the politics of late medieval England...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the extent to which {{measures}} and operationalisations of intra-organisational trust reflect the essential elements of the existing conceptualisation of trust inside the workplace. Design/methodology/approach – The paper provides an overview of the essential points from the rich variety of competing conceptualisations and definitions in the management and organisational literatures. It draws on this overview to present a framework of issues for researchers to consider when designing research based on trust. This framework is then used to analyse the content of 14 recently published empirical measures of intra-organisational trust. It is noted for each measure the form that trust takes, the content, the sources of evidence and the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>recipient,</b> as well as matters related to the wording of items. Findings – The paper highlights where existing measures match the theory, but also shows a number of “blind-spots” or contradictions, particularly over the content of the trust belief, the selection of possible sources of evidence for trust, and inconsistencies in the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> the referent. Research limitations/implications – It offers researchers some recommendations for future research designed to capture trust among different parties in organisations, and contains an Appendix with 14 measures for intra-organisational trust. Originality/value – The value of the paper is twofold: it provides an overview of the conceptualisation literature, and a detailed content-analysis of several different measures for trust.

40|$|To {{understand}} medication {{errors and}} to identify preventive strategies, we need to classify them and define the terms that describe them. The four main approaches to defining technical terms consider etymology, usage, previous definitions, and the Ramsey–Lewis method (based on an understanding of theory and practice). A medication error is ‘a failure in the treatment process that leads to, or {{has the potential to}} lead to, harm to the patient’. Prescribing faults, a subset of medication errors, should be distinguished from prescription errors. A prescribing fault is ‘a failure in the prescribing [decision-making] process that leads to, or has the potential to lead to, harm to the patient’. The converse of this, ‘balanced prescribing’ is ‘the use of a medicine that is appropriate to the patient's condition and, within the limits created by the uncertainty that attends therapeutic decisions, in a dosage regimen that optimizes the balance of benefit to harm’. This excludes all forms of prescribing faults, such as irrational, inappropriate, and ineffective prescribing, underprescribing and overprescribing. A prescription error is ‘a failure in the prescription writing process that results in a wrong instruction about {{one or more of the}} normal features of a prescription’. The ‘normal features’ include the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>recipient,</b> the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> the drug, the formulation, dose, route, timing, frequency, and duration of administration. Medication errors can be classified, invoking psychological theory, as knowledge-based mistakes, rule-based mistakes, action-based slips, and memory-based lapses. This classification informs preventive strategies...|$|R
40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the legal status}} of so-called contracts for anonymity between fertility clinics and donors of gametes that were made in the period before legislation authorising disclosure. It notes that while clinics frequently cite the existence of these "contracts" to argue against retrospective legislation authorising disclosure <b>of</b> the donor's <b>identity,</b> they may be nothing more than one-sided statements of informed consent. However, the article notes that even if an agreement between a donor and a clinic is not contractual, it does not follow that a person conceived through assisted reproductive technology has any right of access to the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> the donor. The writer {{has not been able to}} locate examples of written promises by the clinics promising anonymity. There are written promises by the donors not to seek the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>recipients.</b> These promises do not bind the resulting offspring nor do they appear to be supported by consideration. The article suggests that the basis for any individual donor to restrain a clinic from revealing their identity may be found in promissory estoppel. Nevertheless, there is no real issue in Australia concerning clinics revealing these details absent legislative authority. The issue is whether parliaments will legislate to authorise the disclosure. The article notes that it would be rare for parliaments to legislate to overturn existing legal contracts but suggests that the contract argument may not be as strong as has been thought...|$|R

40|$|In secure communication, users {{must have}} a method <b>of</b> authenticating the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> their data, and vice versa. This {{requires}} the capability of generating a unique yet reproducible signature {{under a variety of}} environmental conditions. At present, these unique signatures are widely generated by Physically Unclonable Functions, or PUFs, which use physical characteristics of specific structures containing inherent randomness due to their manufacturing process. These hard to predict physical responses are quantised to generate a unique identity which can be used for authentication. However, these devices are size-limited by their classical design, posing challenges to microelectronic implementation. Here we show that the extensively studied and problematic fluctuations in the current-voltage measurements of Resonant Tunnelling Diodes (RTDs) can be reapplied to function as a PUF without conventional size limitations. This is possible due to quantum-mechanical tunnelling within the RTD, and, on account of these room temperature quantum effects, we term such devices QUFs – Quantum Unclonable Functions. When stimulated with a range of voltages, these devices produce a range of current outputs whilst exhibiting characteristic negative differential resistance in the region where resonant tunnelling takes place. The resultant current-voltage spectra are dependent on the exact atomic structure and composition of the quantum well within the RTD, and so are unique to the device in question. This allows us to create ‘PUF-like’ devices at the on-chip scale which explicitly make use of room-temperature quantum phenomena and subsequently provides a path towards resource-low quantum authentication protocols...|$|R
40|$|Proxy re-encryption (PRE) {{allows a}} proxy to convert a {{ciphertext}} encrypted under one key into an encryption {{of the same}} message under another key. The main idea is to place as little trust and reveal as little information to the proxy as necessary {{to allow it to}} perform its translations. At the very least, the proxy should not be able to learn the keys of the participants or the content of the messages it re-encrypts. However, in all prior PRE schemes, it is easy for the proxy to determine between which participants a re-encryption key can transform ciphertexts. This can be a problem in practice. For example, in a secure distributed file system, content owners may want to use the proxy to help re-encrypt sensitive information without revealing to the proxy the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>recipients.</b> In this work, we propose key-private (or anonymous) re-encryption keys as an additional useful property of PRE schemes. We formulate a definition of what it means for a PRE scheme to be secure and key-private. Surprisingly, we show that this property is not captured by prior definitions or achieved by prior schemes, including even the secure obfuscation of PRE by Hohenberger et al. (TCC 2007). Finally, we propose the first key-private PRE construction and prove its CPA-security under a simple extension of Decisional Bilinear Diffie Hellman assumption and its key-privacy under the Decision Linear assumption in the standard model. ...|$|R
