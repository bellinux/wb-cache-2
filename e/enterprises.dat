In this study, based on principal-agent, firstly we analyses cooperative management factors in supply chain including leading <b>enterprise</b> expected utilities, subsidiary <b>enterprise</b> expected incomes and leading <b>enterprise</b> agency cost, then the incentive contract model is constructed; Secondly {{the model is}} solved {{in the case of}} symmetric information and asymmetric information; At last, in order to make clear of the model, this paper does mathematical analysis of leading <b>enterprise</b> expected utilities, subsidiary <b>enterprise</b> expected incomes and leading <b>enterprise</b> agency cost. Some important conclusions are obtained: subsidiary <b>enterprise</b> ability, cost coefficient, absolute risk aversion factor and output variance has the same influence on leading <b>enterprise</b> expected utilities and subsidiary <b>enterprise</b> expected incomes; subsidiary <b>enterprise</b> ability, cost coefficient has the same influence on leading <b>enterprise</b> expected utilities, subsidiary <b>enterprise</b> expected incomes and leading <b>enterprise</b> agency cost; leading <b>enterprise</b> expected utilities and subsidiary <b>enterprise</b> expected incomes become bigger and bigger, but leading <b>enterprise</b> agency cost becomes smaller and smaller with absolute risk aversion factor and output variance decreased. etc. Leading <b>enterprise</b> can take on incentive measures (improving subsidiary <b>enterprise</b> ability, decreasing subsidiary <b>enterprise</b> cost coefficient. etc) to optimize supply chain management based on the common factors...|$|R
