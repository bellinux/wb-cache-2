5|$|At the palace, Nero tells Agrippina of his {{troubles}} {{and decides to}} renounce love for political ambition ("Come nube che fugge dal vento"). But Pallas and Narcissus <b>have</b> <b>by</b> now revealed Agrippina's original plot to Claudius, so that when Agrippina urges the Emperor to yield the throne to Nero, he accuses her of treachery. She then claims that her efforts to secure the throne for Nero had all along been a ruse to safeguard the throne for Claudius ("Se vuoi pace"). Claudius believes her; nevertheless, when Poppaea, Otho, and Nero arrive, Claudius announces that Nero and Poppaea will marry, and that Otho shall have the throne. No one is satisfied with this arrangement, as their desires have all changed, so Claudius {{in a spirit of}} reconciliation reverses his judgement, giving Poppaea to Otho and the throne to Nero. He then summons the goddess Juno, who descends to pronounce a general blessing ("V'accendano le tede i raggi delle stelle").|$|E
5|$|Oganesson is {{expected}} to <b>have</b> <b>by</b> far the broadest polarizability of all elements before it in the periodic table, almost double that of radon. By extrapolating from the other noble gases, it {{is expected}} that oganesson has a boiling point between 320 and 380 K. This {{is very different from the}} previously estimated values of 263K or 247 K. Even given the large uncertainties of the calculations, it seems highly unlikely that oganesson would be a gas under standard conditions, and as the liquid range of the other gases is very narrow, between 2 and 9 kelvins, this element should be solid at standard conditions. If oganesson forms a gas under standard conditions nevertheless, it would be one of the densest gaseous substances at standard conditions, even if it is monatomic like the other noble gases.|$|E

50|$|Many doctors {{recommend}} waiting four to {{six weeks}} before resuming sex, to allow the cervix to close, bleeding (known as lochia) to stop, and tears to heal. A study of women in Turkey found that 42% resumed sexual intercourse within six weeks of giving birth. American and British studies found that at six weeks, 57% of women had resumed sexual intercourse, 82-85% <b>had</b> <b>by</b> three months, and 89-90% <b>had</b> <b>by</b> six months.

5|$|Some jumping spiders' {{visual acuity}} exceeds {{by a factor}} of ten that of dragonflies, which <b>have</b> <b>by</b> far the best vision among insects; in fact the human eye is only about five times sharper than a jumping spider's. They achieve this by a telephoto-like series of lenses, a four-layer retina and the ability to swivel their eyes and {{integrate}} images from different stages in the scan. The downside is that the scanning and integrating processes are relatively slow.|$|E
5|$|When Mary died of {{smallpox}} in 1694, William continued to reign alone. Anne became his heir apparent, since any children he might <b>have</b> <b>by</b> another wife {{were assigned to}} a lower place {{in the line of}} succession, and the two reconciled publicly. He restored her previous honours, allowed her to reside in St James's Palace, and gave her Mary's jewels, but excluded her from government and refrained from appointing her regent during his absences abroad. Three months later, William restored Marlborough to his offices. With Anne's restoration at court, Berkeley House became a social centre for courtiers who had previously avoided contact with Anne and her husband.|$|E
5|$|Within the abyssal and hadal zones, {{the areas}} around {{submarine}} hydrothermal vents and cold seeps <b>have</b> <b>by</b> far the greatest biomass and biodiversity per unit area. Fueled by the chemicals dissolved in the vent fluids, {{these areas are}} often home to large and diverse communities of thermophilic, halophilic and other extremophilic prokaryotic microorganisms (such {{as those of the}} sulfide-oxidizing Beggiatoa genus), often arranged in large bacterial mats near cold seeps. In these locations, chemosynthetic archaea and bacteria typically form the base of the food chain. Although the process of chemosynthesis is entirely microbial, these chemosynthetic microorganisms often support vast ecosystems consisting of complex multicellular organisms through symbiosis. These communities are characterized by species such as vesicomyid clams, mytilid mussels, limpets, isopods, giant tube worms, soft corals, eelpouts, galatheid crabs, and alvinocarid shrimp. The deepest seep community discovered thus far is in the Japan Trench, at a depth of 7700meters.|$|E

5|$|The {{greater number}} of naturalists who have taken into {{consideration}} the whole structure of man, including his mental faculties, have followed Blumenbach and Cuvier, and have placed man in a separate Order, under {{the title of the}} Bimana, and therefore on an equality with the orders of the Quadrumana, Carnivora, etc. Recently many of our best naturalists have recurred to the view first propounded by Linnaeus, so remarkable for his sagacity, and have placed man in the same Order with the Quadrumana, under the title of the Primates. The justice of this conclusion will be admitted: for in the first place, we must bear in mind the comparative insignificance for classification of the great development of the brain in man, and that the strongly marked differences between the skulls of man and the Quadrumana (lately insisted upon by Bischoff, Aeby, and others) apparently follow from their differently developed brains. In the second place, we must remember that nearly all the other and more important differences between man and the Quadrumana are manifestly adaptive in their nature, and relate chiefly to the erect position of man; such as the structure of his hand, foot, and pelvis, the curvature of his spine, and the position of his head. I absolutely know of none. If only someone might tell me a single one! If I would have called man a simian or vice versa, I would have brought together all the theologians against me. Perhaps I ought to <b>have</b> <b>by</b> virtue of the law of the discipline.|$|E

25|$|The {{political}} and social assumptions underlying the early Robin Hood ballads have long been controversial. It has been influentially argued by J. C. Holt that the Robin Hood legend was cultivated in the households of the gentry, {{and that it would}} be mistaken to see in him a figure of peasant revolt. He is not a peasant but a yeoman, and his tales make no mention of the complaints of the peasants, such as oppressive taxes. He appears not so much as a revolt against societal standards as an embodiment of them, being generous, pious, and courteous, opposed to stingy, worldly, and churlish foes. Other scholars <b>have</b> <b>by</b> contrast stressed the subversive aspects of the legend, and see in the medieval Robin Hood ballads a plebeian literature hostile to the feudal order.|$|E
25|$|Brexia is a deviant genus, {{that was}} {{assigned}} {{early on to}} the Brexiaceae or Brexioideae, together with two other enigmatic, monotypic genera, Ixerba and Roussea. The common characters between these taxa are few and are shared with many other Pentapetalae. These common characters include {{that they are all}} small trees or shrubs with simple leathery evergreen leaves, with an entire or serrated margin, and pentamerous flowers set individually or in cymes in the axil of the leaves. Botanist have differed on the rank and placement of these three genera. They <b>have</b> <b>by</b> some authors also been assigned to the Escalloniaceae, Saxifragaceae, Grossulariaceae, and the Hydrangeaceae. Genetic data indicate that the three genera are not each other's closest relatives, in fact are not closely related at all. Ixerba has now been included in the Strasburgeriaceae. Roussea is most related to Carpodetus, Cuttsia and Abrophyllum, that are nowadays combined in the Rousseaceae family, the sistergroup of the Campanulaceae, and together representing the basic branche of the Asterales. Brexia is closely related to the large Celastracean genera Pleurostylia and Elaeodendron.|$|E
