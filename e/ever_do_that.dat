25|$|On 3 April 2016, Djokovic won the 2016 Miami Open for {{the third}} {{consecutive}} year, and did so without dropping a set en route to his sixth career Miami Open title, tying him with Andre Agassi for most ever Miami Open men's singles titles. In addition, 2016 marked the third consecutive year that Djokovic swept both Indian Wells and the Miami Open, the first male singles player to <b>ever</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> This was also the fourth time in his career Djokovic won both Miami and Indian Wells back-to-back. His finals win in Miami saw Djokovic surpass Roger Federer to become the all-time leading prize money winner on the ATP tour with career earnings of $98.2million. After an early round exit at the Monte Carlo Masters, Djokovic quickly bounced back by winning the Madrid title {{for the second time in}} his career with a three set victory over Murray. They met again in the Rome Masters final one week later with Murray the victor, despite a sluggish performance, Djokovic defeated Nadal and Nishikori in two long quarterfinals and semi-finals.|$|E

500|$|Cassandra Peterson, later television's Elvira, met Presley {{during this}} period in Las Vegas, where she {{was working as a}} showgirl. She recalls of their encounter, [...] "He was so anti-drug when I met him. I {{mentioned}} to him that I smoked marijuana, and he was just appalled. He said, 'Don't <b>ever</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> again.'" [...] Presley was not only deeply opposed to recreational drugs, he also rarely drank. Several of his family members had been alcoholics, a fate he intended to avoid.|$|E

2500|$|Bradley Cooper {{said that}} [...] "logistically, {{to get from}} point A to point B [...] {{incredibly}} difficult and the bureaucracy and getting things done. There are always tons {{of people around the}} set and Todd loves a lean set and it was always the opposite, so watching a director deal with that – especially when it was Todd Phillips – was interesting." [...] He then went on to say, in a later part of the interview, that [...] "it was the hardest shoot <b>that</b> I had <b>ever</b> <b>done,</b> <b>that</b> Zach had <b>ever</b> <b>done,</b> <b>that</b> Ed had <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> and <b>that</b> Todd had ever done." ...|$|R

500|$|Slayer has {{toyed with}} the idea of {{creating}} a live set mixed with selections from the album and 1990's Seasons in the Abyss, though Hanneman said it's something which hasn't been [...] "seriously considered". Metal Maniacs asked Slayer in a 2006 interview whether they would consider playing South of Heaven in the footsteps of the Still Reigning tour, to which Araya replied, [...] "It's becoming a trendy thing now. I don't know. We have some really cool albums, but I don't think we'll <b>ever</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> again." [...] King was equally unsure, commenting, [...] "Probably not. And I just don't like enough songs off South of Heaven." ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 24, 1901, 63-year-old Michigan {{school teacher}} Annie Edson Taylor {{became the first}} person to go over the falls in a barrel as a {{publicity}} stunt; she survived, bleeding, but otherwise unharmed. Soon after exiting the barrel, she said, [...] "No one ought <b>ever</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> again." [...] Before Taylor's attempt, on October 19 a domestic cat named Iagara was sent over the Horseshoe Falls in her barrel to test its strength. Contrary to rumours at the time, the cat survived the plunge unharmed and later posed with Taylor in photographs. Since Taylor's historic ride, 14 people have intentionally gone over the falls in or on a device, despite her advice. Some have survived unharmed, but others have drowned or been severely injured. Survivors face charges and stiff fines, as it is illegal, {{on both sides of the}} border, to attempt to go over the falls.|$|E
2500|$|Charles {{made his}} debut for Wales {{in a game}} against Northern Ireland at Windsor Park on 20 April 1955; the Welsh won 3–2 thanks to a John Charles hat-trick. His second cap came against Austria on 23 November, in a game latter dubbed the 'Battle of Wrexham'. He was stretchered off with fifteen minutes to go after an Austrian boot went through the back of his leg; this was notable as the only time John ever lost his temper, as he reacted to the {{challenge}} by lifting the Austrian off the ground and screaming [...] "If you <b>ever</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> to my brother again I'll bloody kill you!" [...] Charles was then selected for the 1957 British Home Championship squad, and helped his country to record a 2–2 draw with Scotland at Ninian Park. He also battled against injury to play in the 3–1 defeat to England at Wembley Stadium, before the tournament ended with a goalless draw in Ireland.|$|E

2500|$|Coincidentally at {{this same}} time a new {{panchromatic}} photographic emulsion was developed that allowed {{the full range of}} colors to be captured. Soon after it became available Stieglitz aimed his 8" [...] x 10" [...] view camera at the sky and began taking pictures. By the next year he had created a series of ten mounted photographs he called Music: A Sequence of Ten Cloud Photographs (also called Clouds in Ten Movements). He told his wife Georgia O'Keeffe [...] "I wanted a series that when seen by Ernest Bloch (the great composer) he would exclaim: Music! Music! Man, why that is music! How did you <b>ever</b> <b>do</b> <b>that?</b> And he would point to violins and flutes, and oboes, and brass…" [...] He first exhibited this series in 1923 in his one-man show at the Anderson Galleries in New York, and reported that when Bloch saw them there he had exactly the reaction Stieglitz had wanted.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1984, Double Trouble began {{recording}} {{their second}} studio album, Couldn't Stand the Weather, at the Power Station, with John Hammond as executive producer and engineer Richard Mullen. Layton later recalled working with Hammond: [...] "He {{was kind of}} like a nice hand on your shoulder, as opposed to someone that jumped in and said, 'Let's redo this, let's do that more.' He didn't get involved in that way at all. He was a feedback person." [...] As the sessions began, Vaughan's cover of Bob Geddins' [...] "Tin Pan Alley" [...] was recorded while audio levels were being checked. Layton remembers the performance: [...] "...we did probably the quietest version we ever did up 'til that point. We ended it and [...] said, 'That's the best that song will ever sound,' and we went, 'We haven't even got sounds, have we?' He goes, 'That doesn't matter. That's the best you'll <b>ever</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> song.' We tried it again five, six, seven times—I can't even remember. But it never quite sounded like it did that first time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cruyff was {{the most}} famous {{exponent}} {{of the school of}} football known as Total Football (Totaalvoetbal in Dutch) explored by Rinus Michels. Being known as [...] "the total footballer", he {{was also one of the}} brilliant pioneers of the [...] "false nine" [...] position/role in modern football. In Total Football's heyday (in the early 1970s), Cruyff was truly an ‘on-field tactician’, an ‘on-field manager’, or a ‘coach-player’ at the same time, before the concept of player-coach was at the height of its popularity in professional football during the 1980s and 1990s. As Argentina World Cup winner Jorge Valdano said of Cruyff, in an interview with Thomas Goubin of SoFoot.com, “Never in my life have I seen a player like Cruyff rule matches. He was the owner of the show. Much more than his team, the referee or the fans. His grip on what was happening on the field was amazing. He was a player, coach and referee at the same time.”. Chris McMullan (of FootballFanCast.com) writes that “he [...] was an anomaly. A man who played football like no one else. He didn't physically play football after all, he played it with his mind. An esoteric pursuit that completely changed the game. A visionary, a departure, a flight of fancy – Cruyff is the ultimate because his contribution to the game wasn't simply personal. He didn't break records, he didn't win golden boots, and only occasionally dazzled with skills. The reason he is a great is because he understood the game like no one else ever did and probably ever will. (...) His vision, his ability to see the game in a way that no one else could have was his gift. It showcases his talent, the way he formulated the game in his head and then was able to execute it perfectly with his legs.” And he concludes, “There is no one goal, no one clip of football that can encapsulate Johan Cruyff's contribution to football. No one piece of video could <b>ever</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> That's not surprising. Cruyff wasn't a Pele or a Maradona whose careers can be summed up with a series of vines and clips, mountains of goals and skills after another. With Cruyff, you have to think in order to be able to understand it. It doesn't simply happen before your eyes, but it's something altogether more thoughtful, and ultimately more rewarding.” ...|$|E

50|$|In 1952, Jones, halfbacks Gib Dawson and Billy Quinn and fullback Dick Ochoa created Texas' all-time {{greatest}} backfield combination.

Against Texas A&M, Jones, Dawson and Quinn all rushed for more than 100 yards, the first time 3 players <b>ever</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> in a single game for a Longhorn team, and a feat that has only been repeated once since. The team set the school record for rushing, and the school and conference records for total offense. Jones won the Houston Post's Southwest Conference MVP Trophy. The Longhorns won the Southwest Conference and beat Tennessee in the 1953 Cotton Bowl.|$|R
