These objects are perched on stools, and depicted {{as if they were}} sculpture, as in the Picassos of 1930. I have no doubt of Mr. Bacon's uncommon gifts, but these pictures expressing his sense of the atrocious world into which we have survived seems [...] symbols of outrage rather than works of art. If peace redresses him, he may delight as he now dismays." [...] Reflecting on the reaction of critics and the public, Bacon offered, [...] "I've never known why my paintings are known as horrible. I'm always labelled with horror, but I never think about horror. Pleasure is such a diverse thing. And horror is too. Can you call the famous Isenheim altar a horror piece? <b>Its</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the greatest paintings of the Crucifixion, with the body studded with thorns like nails, but oddly enough the form is so grand it takes away from the horror. But that is the horror {{in the sense that it}} is so vitalising; isn't that how people came out of the great tragedies?

Finally, the Bad Boy remix used guest raps from O.D.B and background vocals by Puff Daddy.

[...] Additionally, he complimented the song, writing [...] "At her best, as she is on this clipped, spunky track, Carey is a disco diva for the '90s, a worthy successor to trailblazing women like Donna Summer and Vicki Sue Robinson, R singers with an affinity for the endless groove. Disco? No wonder most rock critics can't get behind her. Party on, Mariah." ...|$|E
