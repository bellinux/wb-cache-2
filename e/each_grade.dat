40|$|AbstractWe {{continue}} {{the study of}} the lower central series and its associated graded components for a free associative algebra with n generators, as initiated in Feigin and Shoikhet (2007) [FS]. We establish a linear bound on the degree of tensor field modules appearing in the Jordan–Hölder series of <b>each</b> <b>graded</b> component. We also bound the leading coefficient of the Hilbert polynomial of <b>each</b> <b>graded</b> component. As applications, we confirm conjectures of P. Etingof and B. Shoikhet concerning the structure of the third graded component...|$|R

5|$|In {{the public}} school system of Baltimore city, music {{education}} is a part of <b>each</b> <b>grade</b> level to high school, at which point it becomes optional. Beginning in first grade, or approximately six years old, Baltimore students begin to learn about melody, harmony and rhythm, and are taught to echo short melodic and rhythmic patterns. They also begin to learn about different musical instruments and distinguish between different kinds of sounds and types of songs. As students progress through the grades, teachers go into more detail and require more proficiency in elementary musical techniques. Students perform rounds in second grade, for example, while movement (i.e. dance) enters the curriculum in third grade. Beginning in middle school in the sixth grade, students are taught to make mature aesthetic judgements, and to understand and respond to a variety of forms of music. In high school, students may choose to take courses in instrumentation or singing, and may be exposed to music {{in other areas of the}} curriculum, such as in theater or drama classes.|$|E
