5|$|Under {{administrative}} law, {{judicial review}} {{is an exercise}} in which the High Court scrutinizes the executive's decisions and orders to ensure that they conform with the law. If the decisions and orders are not authorized by statute or if they have been made in contravention of administrative law principles, the Court can invalidate them. Similarly, if any exercise of power by an executive body contravenes the Constitution, the Court has a <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>declare</b> it invalid. With regards to the ISA and the powers to detain without trial, the scope of judicial review was subject to a succession of changes between 1988 and 1990. These changes revolved around the issue of whether the discretion of the President and the Home Affairs Minister should be assessed objectively or subjectively. During that period, the scope of judicial review was expanded by common law developments but was subsequently curtailed by legislative and constitutional amendments.|$|E

40|$|Over these 10 years, Japanese governments, {{mostly the}} {{ministry}} of social welfare and labor, have continued {{trying to stop the}} {{decline in the number of}} births, but there has been no good change in the situation. It gets even worse, because the measures the governments have established to deal with the effects of a decline in the number of births are only helpful to a few working mothers and leaves out the most mothers, full-time housewives "sengyo-shufu". As a result, the birthrate of Japan keeps declining. The support for the full-time housewives to raise a child is still lacking, even though there are four times more full-time housewives than working mothers in Japan. From this failure, Japanese governments have learned to widen the support for raising a child to full-time housewives. Under the Law for supporting the next coming generation, enacted in 2005, both local governments and companies take <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> <b>declare</b> their positive actions for supporting mothers raising next generation. This means that they take the responsibility as a community or a society which are smaller and more familiar groups than a nation. It helps to create better environments for raising a child in practice. From 2000, the policies for action of welfare have shifted from nation to local governments and that reflects more needs from individuals. Now we would like to introduce the process of how a local community struggles in developing public welfare systems for nursing a child.

60|$|For a {{particular}} reason the words made our young man change colour. The boy noticed {{in an instant}} that he had turned red, whereupon he turned red himself and pupil and master exchanged a longish glance {{in which there was}} a consciousness of many more things than are usually touched upon, even tacitly, in such a relation. It produced for Pemberton an embarrassment; it raised in a shadowy form a question—this was the first glimpse of it—destined to play a singular and, as he imagined, owing to the altogether peculiar conditions, an unprecedented part in his intercourse with his little companion. Later, when he found himself talking with the youngster in a way in which few youngsters could ever have been talked with, he thought of that clumsy moment on the bench at Nice as the dawn of an understanding that had broadened. What had added to the clumsiness then was that he thought it his <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>declare</b> to Morgan that he might abuse him, Pemberton, as much as he liked, but must never abuse his parents. To this Morgan had the easy retort that he hadn’t dreamed of abusing them; which appeared to be true: it put Pemberton in the wrong.|$|E

6000|$|It {{would be}} an affront to my Readers were I to suppose {{that they were not}} as well acquainted with the {{particulars}} of this King's reign as I am myself. It will therefore be saving THEM the task of reading again what they have read before, and MYSELF the trouble of writing what I do not perfectly recollect, by giving only a slight sketch of the principal Events which marked his reign. Among these may be ranked Cardinal Wolsey's telling the father Abbott of Leicester Abbey that [...] "he was come to lay his bones among them," [...] the reformation in Religion and the King's riding through the streets of London with Anna Bullen. It is however but Justice, and my <b>Duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>declare</b> that this amiable Woman was entirely innocent of the Crimes with which she was accused, and of which her Beauty, her Elegance, and her Sprightliness were sufficient proofs, not to mention her solemn Protestations of Innocence, the weakness of the Charges against her, and the King's Character; all of which add some confirmation, tho' perhaps but slight ones when in comparison with those before alledged in her favour. Tho' I do not profess giving many dates, yet as I think it proper to give some and shall of course make choice of those which it is most necessary for the Reader to know, I think it right to inform him that her letter to the King was dated on the 6th of May. The Crimes and Cruelties of this Prince, were too numerous to be mentioned, (as this history I trust has fully shown;) and nothing can be said in his vindication, but that his abolishing Religious Houses and leaving them to the ruinous depredations of time has been of infinite use to the landscape of England in general, which probably was a principal motive for his doing it, since otherwise why should a Man who was of no Religion himself be at so much trouble to abolish one which had for ages been established in the Kingdom. His Majesty's 5th Wife was the Duke of Norfolk's Neice who, tho' universally acquitted of the crimes for which she was beheaded, has been by many people supposed to have led an abandoned life before her Marriage--of this however I have many doubts, since she was a relation of that noble Duke of Norfolk who was so warm in the Queen of Scotland's cause, and who at last fell a victim to it. The Kings last wife contrived to survive him, but with difficulty effected it. He was succeeded by his only son Edward.|$|E
