40|$|Abstract. This Structural health {{monitoring}} {{represents one of}} the primary applications for new sensor technologies. When the number of accelerometers or other vibration sensors installed in structures increases significantly, a problem arises to the transfer and processing of a huge amount of data. Obviously, this can be only solved by using digital equipments. Therefore, the demand for sensors with digital outputs shall increase as many measurements are required to interface with digital equipments. <b>Delta-sigma</b> (∆Σ) <b>modulation</b> has become quite popular for achieving high resolution of analog to digital conversion. The oversampled delta-sigma modulator is a noise shaping quantizer. The main purpose of noise shaping is to reshape the spectrum of quantization noise so that most of the noise is shifted to the area that is far away from the frequency band of interests. In this study, a promising digital sensor using a delta-sigma modulator structure is proposed. By extensive simulations and experiments, it is investigated and verified that the higher the oversampling frequency, the broader the bandwidth and the higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Consequently, our proposed digital method can achieve higher resolution compared to any analog method. In addition, the method widens dynamic range as well...|$|R

The performance of a two-channel interleaved Delta Sigma DAC is very sensitive to the duty cycle of the half-rate clock. This brief presents a closed-form expression for the signal-to-noise-plus-distortion ratio (SNDR) loss of such DACs due to a duty-cycle error for modulators with a noise transfer function of (1 - z(- 1)) (n). Adding a low-order finite-impulse-response filter after the modulator helps to mitigate this problem. A closed-form expression for the SNDR loss in the presence of this filter is also developed. These expressions are useful for choosing a suitable modulator and filter order for an interleaved Delta Sigma DAC in the early stage of the design process.

50|$|Both ADCs and DACs can employ <b>delta-sigma</b> <b>modulation.</b> A delta-sigma ADC first encodes {{an analog}} signal using {{high-frequency}} <b>delta-sigma</b> <b>modulation,</b> and then applies a digital filter {{to form a}} higher-resolution but lower sample-frequency digital output. On the other hand, a delta-sigma DAC encodes a high-resolution digital input signal into a lower-resolution but higher sample-frequency signal that is mapped to voltages, and then smoothed with an analog filter.

50|$|In a {{conventional}} ADC, an analog signal is integrated, or sampled, with a sampling frequency and subsequently quantized in a multi-level quantizer into a digital signal. This process introduces quantization error noise. The {{first step in}} a <b>delta-sigma</b> <b>modulation</b> is delta modulation.

50|$|<b>Delta-sigma</b> <b>modulation</b> {{converts}} {{the analog}} voltage into a pulse frequency and is alternatively known as Pulse Density modulation or Pulse Frequency modulation.

5000|$|Where the Model 700 {{differs from}} {{classical}} <b>delta-sigma</b> <b>modulation</b> {{is in its}} replacement of the single integrator with a complex system of comparators and high-order linear prediction filters. This was done {{in order to reduce}} the quantization error, and is accomplished in part by changing the effective [...] "step size" [...] of the encoder based on previously recorded information. (Thereby increasing or decreasing the slew rate.) The system also has two analog pre-processing steps which compress the input signal in both the amplitude and frequency domain, in order to more closely match the abilities of the encoder.

50|$|A PDM {{bitstream}} is encoded from {{an analog}} signal {{through the process}} of <b>delta-sigma</b> <b>modulation.</b> This process uses a one bit quantizer that produces either a 1 or 0 depending on the amplitude of the analog signal. A 1 or 0 corresponds to a signal that is all the way up or all the way down, respectively. Because in the real world, analog signals are rarely all the way in one direction, there is a quantization error, the difference between the 1 or 0 and the actual amplitude it represents. This error is fed back negatively in the ΔΣ process loop. In this way, every error successively influences every other quantization measurement and its error. This has the effect of averaging out the quantization error.|$|E
5000|$|Note {{that because}} the control law is not continuous, it is {{certainly}} not locally Lipschitz continuous, and so existence and uniqueness of solutions to the closed-loop system is not guaranteed by the Picard-Lindelöf theorem. Thus the solutions are to be understood in the Filippov sense. Roughly speaking, the resulting closed-loop system moving along [...] is approximated by the smooth dynamics [...] however, this smooth behavior may not be truly realizable. Similarly, high-speed pulse-width modulation or <b>delta-sigma</b> <b>modulation</b> produces outputs that only assume two states, but the effective output swings through a continuous range of motion. These complications can be avoided by using a different nonlinear control design method that produces a continuous controller. In some cases, sliding-mode control designs can be approximated by other continuous control designs.|$|E
50|$|In the class-D {{amplifier}} {{the active}} devices (transistors) function as electronic switches instead of linear gain devices; {{they are either}} on or off. The analog signal is converted to a stream of pulses that represents the signal by pulse-width modulation, pulse-density modulation, <b>delta-sigma</b> <b>modulation</b> or a related modulation technique before being applied to the amplifier. The time average power value of the pulses is directly proportional to the analog signal, so after amplification the signal can be converted back to an analog signal by a passive low-pass filter.The purpose of the output filter is to smooth the pulse stream to an analog signal, removing the high frequency spectral components of the pulses. The frequency of the output pulses is typically ten or more times the highest frequency in the input signal to amplify, so that the filter can adequately reduce the unwanted harmonics and accurately reproduce the input.|$|E
5000|$|The Model 700 {{converted}} analog audio into {{digital data}} using {{a type of}} <b>delta-sigma</b> <b>modulation,</b> called [...] "Companded Predictive Delta Modulation," [...] or [...] "CPDM" [...] (both trademarked). In a traditional, single-integrated delta-sigma ADC, the voltage of an input signal is compared to the output of an integrator. If the input signal {{is higher than the}} integrator's output, a 1 is recorded, and the integrator is given a command to increase by a certain amount. On each clock cycle, the comparison is repeated (and another 1 is recorded) until the integrator's output exceeds the input voltage, at which point a 0 is recorded and the integrator is told to decrease. In this way, the integrator attempts to follow the input signal as closely as it can. When fed a constant-voltage signal (or when the input is removed completely), the output will [...] "idle" [...] and produce a stream of alternating 1s and 0s. A decoder listening to this stream would produce a small sinusoidal or triangle-wave output, even though the correct output should be flat: this is a form of quantization error.|$|E
5000|$|Oversampling DACs or interpolating DACs {{such as the}} delta-sigma DAC, use a pulse density {{conversion}} technique. The oversampling technique {{allows for}} the use of a lower resolution DAC internally. A simple 1-bit DAC is often chosen because the oversampled result is inherently linear. The DAC is driven with a pulse-density modulated signal, created {{with the use of a}} low-pass filter, step nonlinearity (the actual 1-bit DAC), and negative feedback loop, in a technique called <b>delta-sigma</b> <b>modulation.</b> This results in an effective high-pass filter acting on the quantization (signal processing) noise, thus steering this noise out of the low frequencies of interest into the megahertz frequencies of little interest, which is called noise shaping. The quantization noise at these high frequencies is removed or greatly attenuated by use of an analog low-pass filter at the output (sometimes a simple RC low-pass circuit is sufficient). Most very high resolution DACs (greater than 16 bits) are of this type due to its high linearity and low cost. Higher oversampling rates can relax the specifications of the output low-pass filter and enable further suppression of quantization noise. Speeds of greater than 100 thousand samples per second (for example, 192 kHz) and resolutions of 24 bits are attainable with delta-sigma DACs. A short comparison with pulse-width modulation shows that a 1-bit DAC with a simple first-order integrator would have to run at 3 THz (which is physically unrealizable) to achieve 24 meaningful bits of resolution, requiring a higher-order low-pass filter in the noise-shaping loop. A single integrator is a low-pass filter with a frequency response inversely proportional to frequency and using one such integrator in the noise-shaping loop is a first order delta-sigma modulator. Multiple higher order topologies (such as MASH) are used to achieve higher degrees of noise-shaping with a stable topology.|$|E
