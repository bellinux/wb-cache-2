Our {{objective was to}} evaluate the practice activities of <b>dermatologists</b> and to establish a 5 -year demographic projection. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in Brittany (France) from November 2014 to January 2015. We also interviewed dermatology residents (incoming years: 2010 to 2015), and collected information about their hometown and their career plans in 5 years. RESULTS: Response rates were 98 % for <b>dermatologists</b> and 100 % for residents. Waiting times for appointments increased from 2010 to 2015 (P< 0. 01). Eighty-seven percent of <b>dermatologists</b> under 50 were women vs. 62 % of <b>dermatologists</b> aged 50 and over (P< 0. 01). The proportion of <b>dermatologists</b> working fewer than 7 half-days per week was higher in women (33 % vs. 13 %, P= 0. 02). The number of retirements foreseen in 5 years was 33 (52 %) among the 63 <b>dermatologists</b> aged 55 and over. Among the 26 residents, 58 % were planning to practice in Brittany and 42 % were considering part-time work. We estimate {{that the number of}} newly graduated <b>dermatologists</b> exercising in Brittany in 5 years will be 25.

In fact, symptoms that are always present in this genetic disorder include tumours of the nervous tissue and bones, small warty growths on the skin, and (which is a peculiar characteristic of this disease) the presence of light brown pigmentation on the skin called café au lait spots.; however, these spots were never observed on Merrick's body. For this reason, although this diagnosis was quite popular through most of the 20th century, other conjectural diagnosis were advanced, such as those of who suffer Maffucci syndrome and polyostotic fibrous dysplasia (Albright's disease).|$|E
5|$|Over time, Jackson's facial {{structure}} {{changed as}} well. Surgeons speculated {{he also had}} a rhinoplasty, a forehead lift, cheekbone surgery, altered his lips, and had a cleft put in his chin. Those close to the singer estimated that, by 1990, he had undergone around ten procedures. According to Taraborrelli, Jackson had his first rhinoplasty after breaking his nose during a complex dance routine in 1979. However, the surgery was not a complete success, and he complained of breathing difficulties that would affect his career. He was referred to Steven Hoefflin, who performed his second rhinoplasty in 1981. Katherine Jackson, though, has {{said in a recent interview}} that Michael intentionally got his first nosejob from Steven Hoefflin. Taraborrelli stated Jackson had a third rhinoplasty three years later and a fourth in 1986. Jackson wrote in his 1988 autobiography Moonwalk that, in addition to the two rhinoplasties, {{he also had a}} dimple created in his chin. From 1986 onward he was a regular client of Arnold Klein, a <b>dermatologist</b> who specializes in dermal filler injection, a non-surgical cosmetic procedure.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to explore the epidemiology of childhood psoriasis in general practitioners (GPs) and dermatological practice in the region of our academic medical centre. The treatments used by GPs and <b>dermatologists</b> in juvenile psoriasis were investigated. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to 229 GPs and 73 <b>dermatologists.</b> Questions were addressed about the prevalence of childhood psoriasis and treatments used in this disease. RESULTS: Seventy-three questionnaires were completed. The response rate was 17. 0 % for GPs and 46. 6 % for <b>dermatologists.</b> Almost one-third of all GPs have seen one or more patients with juvenile psoriasis under the age of 11 in their own patient population, in contrast to more than 80 % of the <b>dermatologists.</b> Extrapolating the results implied an estimated prevalence of childhood psoriasis of 0. 17 % in the overall Dutch population. Topical corticosteroids were used by 46. 2 % of GPs and by 91. 2 % of <b>dermatologists.</b> Vitamin D analogues were prescribed by GPs and <b>dermatologists</b> in 15. 4 % and 73. 5 % of cases, respectively. Systemic medication for juvenile psoriasis was only used by 20. 6 % of <b>dermatologists.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Calculated for the Dutch population, there should be approximately 27, 500 children with psoriasis in The Netherlands. Topical corticosteroids were the first-choice treatment for both GPs and <b>dermatologists,</b> whereas vitamin D analogues were used as a second-choice topical therapy. Systemic medication was only sparsely prescribed by <b>dermatologists...</b>|$|R
40|$|Today, many therapies are {{available}} {{for the treatment of}} psoriasis and eczema. One of the oldest topical therapies is coal tar. Coal tar has been used for decades, but over the past years, the use of coal tar has decreased for several reasons, including the supposed carcinogenicity of coal tar. We investigated the current and past treatment policies for psoriasis and eczema with special emphasis on the use of tar products; a postal survey was conducted among all <b>dermatologists</b> in two European countries: the Netherlands (n = 360) and the Flemish speaking part of Belgium (Flanders) (n = 328). This study was conducted as part of the ongoing LATER-study ("Late effects of coal tar treatment in eczema and psoriasis; the Radboud study"). All practising <b>dermatologists</b> received a questionnaire. <b>Dermatologists</b> were asked to describe their treatment policies in mild/moderate psoriasis, severe psoriasis, mild/moderate eczema and severe eczema. The response rate to the questionnaire was 62. 5 % for the Dutch <b>dermatologists</b> and 45. 7 % for the Flemish <b>dermatologists.</b> Almost all <b>dermatologists</b> prescribe topical corticosteroids. In eczema, most of the <b>dermatologists</b> prescribe the recently introduced calcineurin inhibitors (95 %). Coal tar is a second choice topical therapy. Dutch <b>dermatologists</b> mainly use tar in the treatment of eczema (72 % vs. 48 % in Flanders), whereas in Flanders, tar is mainly prescribed in psoriasis (60 % vs. 41 % in Holland). Flemish <b>dermatologists</b> very frequently prescribe PUVA in psoriasis (93 % vs. 63 %). Topical treatment, especially topical corticosteroids, is the mainstay in psoriasis and eczema. Coal tar still is an important (second choice) therapy for the topical treatment of psoriasis and eczema, but its use varies from country to country. Despite the carcinogenicity of PUVA, this photochemotherapy is frequently prescribed by <b>dermatologists,</b> mainly in Flanders...|$|R
5|$|Ever since Joseph Merrick's days as {{a novelty}} exhibit on Whitechapel Road, his {{condition}} {{has been a source}} of curiosity for medical professionals. His appearance at the meeting of the Pathological Society of London in 1884 drew interest from the doctors present, but none of the answers nor the attention that Treves had hoped for. The case received only a brief mention in the British Medical Journal, and the Lancet declined to mention it at all. Four months later, in 1885, Treves brought the case before the meeting for a second time. By then, Tom Norman's shop on Whitechapel Road had been closed, and the Elephant Man had moved on. Without Merrick, Treves made do with the photographs he had taken during his examinations. One of the doctors present at the meeting was Henry Radcliffe Crocker, a <b>dermatologist</b> who was an authority on skin diseases. After hearing Treves's description of Merrick, and viewing the photographs, Crocker proposed that Merrick's condition might be a combination of dermatolysis, pachydermatocele and an unnamed bone deformity, all caused by changes in the nervous system. Crocker wrote about Merrick's case in his 1888 book Diseases of the Skin: their Description, Pathology, Diagnosis and Treatment.|$|E

A postal questionnaire was sent to 540 consultant gynaecologists and 225 consultant and senior registrar members of the British Association of <b>Dermatologists.</b> 350 gynaecologists and 161 <b>dermatologists</b> returned completed questionnaires. The workload of LS and Paget's disease was evenly distributed, with 54 % of <b>dermatologists</b> and 58 % of gynaecologists seeing more than six cases of LS per annum and less than 1 % seeing more than five cases of Paget's disease. 92 % of responding gynaecologists saw at least one case of VIN per year whereas 43 % of <b>dermatologists</b> saw no cases. Patients with VIN and Paget's were referred to gynaecologists for treatment by 66 % of <b>dermatologists.</b> Both groups are equally prepared to treat LS.

40|$|The {{scientific}} {{committee of the}} SIDAPA (Società Italiana Dermatologia Allergologica Professionale ed Ambientale) planned a questionnaire which was sent by e-mail to 500 randomly selected Italian <b>dermatologists.</b> These <b>dermatologists</b> were working in different hospitals, university departments and private clinics in {{different regions of the}} country. The aim of the investigation was to gather information about the dermatologists' prescriptions of cosmetics, to find out which are the most prescribed cosmetics and how <b>dermatologists</b> face some practical problems connected with the prescription of cosmetics for conditions such as sensitive skin and allergic dermatitis. All data were entered into a data base and statistically analysed using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Scientists) IBM version 1. 1. The response rate to the questionnaire was 25. 4 % of the <b>dermatologists.</b> According to the results, 59. 2 % of <b>dermatologists</b> prescribe up to 40 cosmetics per week, while 41. 8 % prescribe more than 40 cosmetics per week. 93. 6 % of them prescribe detergents, 89. 6 % recommend sun blockers, 85. 6 % shampoos and 85. 1 % moisturizers. Surprisingly enough, 72 % of <b>dermatologists</b> say they prescribe camouflage products. Other cosmetic products such as anticellulite, anti-wrinkle and anti-stretch mark products, anti-perspirants deodorants and products for hair removal, make-up and make-up removal and skin lighteners are less frequently prescribed. The prescription of liquid detergents far outweighs the prescription of other types. For the commonest dermatoses of the scalp, <b>dermatologists</b> usually prescribe shampoos applied twice a week; only in the case of scalp psoriasis are 3 applications per week recommended. More than half of <b>dermatologists</b> try out free samples of cosmetic products on their own skin, particularly moisturizers, deodorants, shampoos and sunblockers. More than 70 % of the respondents consult the suppliers' data sheets, especially for anti-wrinkle products, emollients/moisturizers and sunblockers. Less than 50 % of <b>dermatologists</b> perform an exclusive evaluation of the chemical composition of a new cosmetic product. 89. 6 % of <b>dermatologists</b> are aware of the problem of sensitive skin, a common self-diagnosed skin condition. If contact allergy to a hapten has been previously diagnosed in a patient, <b>dermatologists</b> say they check the composition of the cosmetic product before prescribing: 84 % check "always" and 15. 2 % "often". In conclusion, <b>dermatologists</b> now prescribe a lot of cosmetics, especially those which are usually used in the treatment of skin diseases, such as moisturizers/emollients, detergents and sunblockers. <b>Dermatologists</b> also focus their attention on the characteristics of the cosmetic products as well as on their patients' problems...|$|R

40|$|Background/aim: Although {{complementary}} {{and alternative}} medicine (CAM) use is highly prevalent, {{there is very}} limited information on dermatologists’ attitudes and knowledge about CAM. In this survey, we aimed to study the knowledge and attitude of <b>dermatologists</b> in Saudi Arabia towards CAM. Furthermore, we assessed dermatologists' intention to receive CAM education and training. Methods and design: We collected data through an online cross-sectional survey sent to email addresses of <b>dermatologists</b> in Saudi Arabia. Questions included socio-demographic data, knowledge and attitudes towards CAM practice. Results: A total of 93 questionnaires were returned from <b>dermatologists</b> in various regions of Saudi Arabia. The mean age was 41. 7  ±  10. 3 (range, 25 – 63) years. A total of 67 % of <b>dermatologists</b> had welcoming attitudes towards CAM.

More than 70 % of participants reported an interest in learning about CAM. However, only 9 (9. 7 %) <b>dermatologists</b> had attended CAM courses. Sixty-one participants (65. 6 %) were eager to receive CAM-specific education, and 66 % of <b>dermatologists</b> acknowledged having previously discussed CAM with their patients. The most important reason that <b>dermatologists</b> did not discuss CAM with their patients was a lack of studies supporting CAM (66. 7 %) and the belief that doctors’ knowledge on CAM is insufficient (58. 1 %). Conclusion: A greater number of <b>dermatologists</b> have an affirmative attitude towards CAM.

40|$|Objectives. Juvenile {{localized}} scleroderma (JLS) {{is a rare}} {{condition that}} {{is often difficult to}} assess and for which a variety of monitoring tools have been described. We aimed to describe how monitoring tools are used and perceived by clinicians in the UK, to ascertain treatments used for JLS and to provide a de-scription of transition arrangements to adult care. Methods. An e-survey of UK paediatric rheumatologists and <b>dermatologists</b> managing children and young people (CYP) with JLS was distributed using the national organisations representing these clinician groups. We asked respondents for their views and experience using 15 JLS monitoring tools, about transition services and about treatments used. Results. Thirty-five <b>dermatologists</b> and 13 paediatric rheumatologists responded. Paediatric rheumatolo-gists managed more CYP with JLS than <b>dermatologists</b> (median 1620 and 3, respectively). Transition arrangements were reported by 43 % of <b>dermatologists</b> and 91 % of paediatric rheumatologists. Medical photography was the most frequently regularly used monitoring tool (73 % respondents). The modified Rodnan skin score was the skin score used most commonly: 33 % of paediatric rheumatologists and 3 % of <b>dermatologists</b> reported using this tool frequently. Topical treatments and ultraviolet light were used by 4980 % of <b>dermatologists</b> and 08 % paediatric rheumatologists.
