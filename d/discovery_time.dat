Today, end-users are also highly mobile, often {{equipped with a}} range of portable devices, and they expect service availability when they require it. In addition, {{they do not want to}} be burdened by complex configurations before they can discover and use services. The Zero Configuration (Zeroconf) Networking technology promises to alleviate this configuration burden by allowing users to discover services and devices with little end-user intervention. We compare two popular implementations of Zeroconf namely, Avahi and Mono. Zeroconf running on Linux and Windows XP operating systems, respectively. We evaluate their performance using service <b>discovery</b> <b>time</b> as the performance metric. Our empirical results show that Linux Avahi yields almost 99 % improvements in service <b>discovery</b> <b>time</b> over Windows Mono. Zeroconf.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we {{introduce}} {{and evaluate}} novel adaptive schemes for neighbor discovery in Bluetooth-enabled ad-hoc networks. In an ad-hoc peer-to-peer setting, neighbor search is a continuous, hence battery draining process. In {{order to save}} energy when the device is unlikely to encounter a neighbor, we adaptively choose parameter settings depending on a mobility context to decrease the expected power consumption of Bluetooth-enabled devices. For this purpose, we first determine the mean <b>discovery</b> <b>time</b> and power consumption values for different Bluetooth parameter settings through a comprehensive exploration of the parameter space by means of simulation validated by experiments on real devices. The fastest average <b>discovery</b> <b>time</b> obtained is 0. 2 s, while at an average <b>discovery</b> <b>time</b> of 1 s the power consumption is just 1. 5 {{times that of the}} idle mode on our devices. We then introduce two adaptive algorithms for dynamically adjusting the Bluetooth parameters based on past perceived activity in the ad-hoc network. Both adaptive schemes for selecting the discovery mode are based only on locally-available information. We evaluate these algorithms in a node mobility simulation. Our adaptive algorithms reduce energy consumption by 50 % and have up to 8 % better performance over a static power-conserving scheme. I...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} simple and {{scalable}} web-based model for grid resource discovery for the Internet. The resource discovery model contains the metadata and resource finder web services. The information of resource finder web services is kept in the repositories that are distributed in the application layer of Internet. The resource finder web services will be discovered by sending queries to the repositories {{in a similar way}} as the DNS protocol. The underlying technology for implementation of the two architectures of this model is introduced. These architectures are: Direct and Centralized Web-Based Grid Resource Discovery. The resource <b>discovery</b> <b>time</b> is computed after simulating each of these models in GridSim. By performing scalability tests, we found that when increasing the load on the grid with more users and resources, the cost of our model in comparison to the grid resource <b>discovery</b> <b>time</b> is marginal...|$|E
40|$|With the {{increasing}} adoption of Web Services and service-oriented computing para-digm, matchmaking of web services with the request {{has become a}} significant task. This warrants the need to establish an effective and reliable Web Service discovery. Here re-ducing the service <b>discovery</b> <b>time</b> and increasing the quality of discovery are key issues. This paper proposes a new semantic Web Service discovery scheme where the similarity between the query and service is decided using the WSDL specification and ontology, and the improved Hungarian algorithm is applied to quickly find the maximum match. The proposed approach utilizes the structure of datatype and operation, and natural lan-guage description used for information retrieval. Computer simulation reveals that the proposed scheme substantially increases the quality of service discovery compared to the existing schemes in term of precision, recall rate, and F-measure. Moreover, the pro-posed scheme allows consistently smaller <b>discovery</b> <b>time,</b> while the improvement gets more significant {{as the number of}} compared parameters increases...|$|E

This thesis {{presents}} a quantitative analysis of {{medium access control}} (MAC) delays in saturated ad hoc networks {{and their impact on}} node packet service-time. First, the medium access delay at an ad hoc node was modeled in terms of the time spent in collisions and successful transmission. Secondly, the variations in route <b>discovery</b> <b>time</b> with respect to the variations in medium access delays were analyzed. Finally, the overall effect of MAC delay on node packet service time was discussed. In stationary networks, the routing delays are negligible after the initial route discoveries; hence MAC delays determine the packet service-time. In mobile networks, the upper layer delays associated with node transmission such as route <b>discovery</b> <b>time</b> together with MAC delay effect the node packet service-time. The simulations were carried out for stationary network scenarios, and the results support the presented model...|$|E

40|$|No single {{wireless}} network technology simultaneously provides a low latency, high bandwidth, wide area data service {{to a large}} number of mobile users. Wireless Overlay Networks – a hierarchical structure of room-size, building-size, and wide area data networks – solve the problem of providing network connectivity to {{a large number of}} mobile users in an efficient and scalable way. The specific topology of cells and the wide variety of network technologies that comprise wireless overlay networks present new problems that have not been encountered in previous cellular handoff systems. We have implemented a vertical handoff system that allows users to roam between cells in wireless overlay networks. Our goal is to provide a user with the best possible connectivity {{for as long as possible}} with a minimum of disruption during handoff. Results of our initial implementation show that the handoff latency is bounded by the <b>discovery</b> <b>time,</b> the amount of time before the mobile host discovers that it has moved into or out of a new wireless overlay. This <b>discovery</b> <b>time</b> is measured in seconds: large enough to disrupt reliable transport protocols such as TCP and introduce significant disruptions in continuous multimedia transmission. To efficiently support applications that cannot tolerate these disruptions, we present enhancements to the basic scheme that significantly reduce the <b>discovery</b> <b>time</b> without assuming any knowledge about specific channel characteristics. For handoffs between room-size and building-size overlays, these enhancements lead to a best-case handoff latency of approximately 170 ms with a 1. 5 % overhead in terms of network resources. For handoffs between building-size and wide-area data networks, the best-case handoff latency is approximately 800 ms with a similarly low overhead. 1...|$|E
