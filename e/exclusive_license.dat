40|$|The {{question}} of whether <b>exclusive</b> <b>licensing</b> {{of the right to}} provide harbour towage services in ports can provide a superior outcome to open competition has been among the questions that have recently preoccupied Australian policymakers. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to evaluate the arguments for and against the introduction of <b>exclusive</b> <b>licensing</b> of harbour towage by way of a review of the more general literature on franchise bidding. The paper argues that the general policy trend in Australia towards greater acceptance of <b>exclusive</b> <b>licensing</b> arrangements for harbour towage in Australia is misguided because the costs of open entry tend to be overestimated while the practical difficulties of <b>exclusive</b> <b>licensing</b> tend to be underestimated. ...|$|R

5|$|In 1925, Sam Warner of Warner Bros., then a small Hollywood {{studio with}} big ambitions, saw a {{demonstration}} of the Western Electric sound-on-disc system and was sufficiently impressed to persuade his brothers to agree to experiment with using this system at New York's Vitagraph Studios, which they had recently purchased. The tests were convincing to the Warner Brothers, if not to the executives of some other picture companies who witnessed them. Consequently, in April 1926 the Western Electric Company entered into a contract with Warner Brothers and W. J. Rich, a financier, giving them an <b>exclusive</b> <b>license</b> for recording and reproducing sound pictures under the Western Electric system. To exploit this license the Vitaphone Corporation was organized with Samuel L. Warner as its president.|$|E

25|$|Encouraged by this success, Nintendo {{turned its}} {{attention}} to the North American market, entering into negotiations with Atari to release the Famicom under Atari’s name as the Nintendo Advanced Video Gaming System. The deal was set to be finalized and signed at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in June 1983. However, Atari discovered at that show that its competitor Coleco was illegally demonstrating its Coleco Adam computer with Nintendo's Donkey Kong game. This violation of Atari's <b>exclusive</b> <b>license</b> with Nintendo to publish the game for its own computer systems delayed the implementation of Nintendo's game console marketing contract with Atari. Atari's CEO Ray Kassar was fired the next month, so the deal went nowhere, and Nintendo decided to market its system on its own.|$|E

25|$|In October 2001, Brazin Limited (owner of Australia's largest {{entertainment}} retailer, Sanity) reintroduced Virgin Megastores in {{the country}} via two related transactions with the Virgin Group, acquiring 77 troubled Our Price music stores in the UK for a symbolic £2, and inturn gaining <b>exclusive</b> <b>license</b> rights in Australia for Virgin Entertainment, initially setting up the first Virgin Megastore on Chapel Street's, The Jam Factory in April 2002. Brazin also intended to use the Virgin brand to open 45 new Megastores in addition to converting 55 of its existing small-scale IN2 Music stores that had not already been rebranded as Sanity. Yet, the programme stalled as Brazin battled internal disruptions and struggled to separate the target-markets for Virgin and its chain of more than 200 Sanity stores (at the time). As a result, the company's entertainment division posted a $27 million loss in financial year, 2002–03, and by mid-2004, Brazin had only managed to open 12 Virgin Megastores.|$|E
25|$|After {{a number}} of failures, the radical new process for {{flotation}} emerged in the laboratory at the University of Newcastle. Jameson filed a provisional patent application in 1986. After an initial trial at the Renison Bell tin mine in Tasmania, certain design features were modified. He led a further plant trial with a small cell in the lead-zinc concentrator at Mt Isa Mines Ltd in Queensland, initially working alone. The plant metallurgists {{took an interest in}} the technology and helped to refine it, particularly checking the scale-up procedures that Jameson had devised. In 1988 a recent graduate was assigned full-time for a year to verify and validate the performance of the Cell. In 1989 a worldwide <b>exclusive</b> <b>license</b> was negotiated between Tunra Ltd on behalf of the University of Newcastle, Jameson, and MIM Holdings Limited, {{for the use of the}} Cell for metallurgical purposes.
