40|$|This {{article focuses}} on {{optimizing}} the electrospinning parameters, and developing a new method of Direct-Write (DW) micro/nano-structure based on Near-Field Electrospinning (NFES) for <b>flexible</b> electronic <b>manufacturing.</b> NFES is {{a new way to}} realize controllable electrospinning and precision-positioning of nanofiber, by which nano-structure with diameter from 50 nm to 500 nm can be fabricated orderly and accurately. A tungsten electrode with tip diameter of 25 mu m is used to DW nano-structure, with the minimum bias voltage 600 V, minimum electrode to collector distance 500 mu m. A microstructure DW system is designed, by which micro-structure with diameter of several micrometers can be drawn. In this work a needle tube of 232 mu m inside diameter is used as spinneret, electrode to collector distance is various from 2 mm to 10 mm, and the collector moving speed ranges from 0. 07 m/s to 7 m/s. The DW process and character of micro-structure such as line width, smoothness and thickness can be controlled by optimizing the electrospinng parameters. The DW micro/nano-structure is continuous and smooth, which can be drawn on expected site and in expected direction with accurate dimension. The new method based on NEFS with the advantage of narrower line width and smoother structure than traditional <b>flexible</b> electronic <b>manufacturing</b> technologies, which is more suitable for the development of <b>flexible</b> electronic <b>manufacturing...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{combination}} of multi-functional machines and mobile robots supports emergence of highly <b>flexible</b> intelligent <b>manufacturing</b> systems (IMS). In {{this kind of}} manufacturing system some machines must, stay fixed at previously established positions (heavy equipment) but some types of multi-functional machines (small flexible equipment and mobile robots) can stay in one position for one or several periods and change their position for others periods, or change permanently {{their position in the}} shop floor. Moreover, using mobile robots allows performing transportation and operation Simultaneously. This possibility may change the decision processes and manufacturing system configuration, calling into question the existing decision methods in strategic, tactical mid operational levels. This paper concerns the specific production systems in which mobile robots operate in the same shop floor {{and at the same time}} with conventional and multi-functional machines and humans. This kind of production system is more sophisticated than conventional manufacturing chain (as cellular manufacturing System) and can decrease the reactivity time and new products can be quickly introduced (as for dynamic cellular manufacturing system). However, the configuration and optimization of this kind of system is very different from conventional production systems. In thiS paper, in one hand, the advantages of this kind of system and then several difficulties and challenges from operation management and industrial engineering point of view in configuration, organization, planning and optimization of IMS is discussed and developed. As a first step it is considered that localization is a key issue in the highly <b>flexible</b> intelligent <b>manufacturing.</b> Several approaches exist for outdoor localization, but indoor localization is an open problem. In this work, it is presented and discussed the highly <b>flexible</b> intelligent <b>manufacturing</b> system and the indoor localization.

We allow firms to operate a mix of technologies, using a flexible system to serve some types of consumer submarkets and a designated technology to serve others and allow firms to offer multiple products even if they commit to the designated technology. We show that for flexible systems to be preferred they must offer strong economies of scope and must be capable of producing, without significant cost penalties, customized products that are largely indistinguishable from custom-built products. By contrast, we show that an increase in submarket size {{and an increase in}} the willingness of consumers to pay for particular types of products encourages the use of designated technologies targeted at these submarkets.
