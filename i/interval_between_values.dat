40|$|Results of {{our recent}} {{re-analysis}} of the electroweak {{contribution to the}} relation between pole and running masses of top-quark within the Standard Model is reviewed. We argue, that if vacuum of SM is stable, then there exists an optimal value of renormalization group scale (IR-point), at which the radiative corrections to the matching condition between parameters of Higgs sector and pole masses is minimal or equal to zero. Within the available accuracy, we find the IR-point to lie in an <b>interval</b> <b>between</b> <b>value</b> of Z-boson mass and twice the value of W-boson mass. The value of scale is relevant for extraction of Higgs self-coupling from cross-section {{as well as for}} construction of effective Lagrangian.

The piece explores the move from the 4 : 3 screen ratio to 16 : 9, which is now effectively the standard for broadcast television and video. In the construction of New Ratio each colour was assigned a particular tone: white was attributed a standard 1 KHz test tone; the pitch of the tone attributed to blue was half that of the test tone; and each of the colours in between (in descending order of luminance) were attributed tones at <b>intervals</b> <b>between</b> these <b>values.</b> The video comprises two simple repeating sequences, which are fundamentally the same duration. However, one sequence includes an additional frame of black that throws them out of synch causing a phasing that effects different mixtures of colour and a range of tone combinations.

40|$|Several {{new data}} {{structures}} are presented for dictionaries containing elements with different weights (access probabilities). The structures use just one location {{in addition to}} those required for the values of the elements. The first structure supports a worst-case search time that is within a constant multiplicative factor of optimal, in terms of the rank of the weight of the desired element with respect to the multiset of weights. If the values of the elements that comprise the dictionary have been drawn from a uniform distribution, then a variation of this structure achieves average search times that are asymptotically very good. Similar results are established for data structures which handle the case in which the <b>intervals</b> <b>between</b> consecutive dictionary <b>values</b> also have access probabilities.

5|$|The {{work of the}} {{surveying}} {{team was}} greatly hampered by the inclemency of the weather, and it took until 1776 to complete the task. To find {{the volume of the}} mountain, it was necessary to divide it into a set of vertical prisms and compute the volume of each. The triangulation task falling to Charles Hutton was considerable: the surveyors had obtained thousands of bearings to more than a thousand points around the mountain. Moreover, the vertices of his prisms did not always conveniently coincide with the surveyed heights. To make sense of all his data, he hit upon the idea of interpolating a series of lines at set <b>intervals</b> <b>between</b> his measure <b>values,</b> marking points of equal height. In doing so, not only could he easily determine the heights of his prisms, but from the swirl of the lines one could get an instant impression of the form of the terrain.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} how spatial <b>intervals</b> <b>between</b> successive visual flashes {{are influenced by}} the temporal <b>intervals</b> <b>between</b> auditory pure tones presented concurrently with the flashes. Three successive visual flashes defined two spatial intervals with different extents as well as two equal temporal intervals.

Observers judged which of the first or second spatial <b>intervals</b> <b>between</b> flashes was shorter. The results showed that the shorter temporal <b>interval</b> <b>between</b> tones caused underestimation of the spatial <b>interval</b> <b>between</b> flashes.

This paper presents a model developed to establish the optimal time <b>interval</b> <b>between</b> inspections for a two-unit cold standby system with component repair and subject to periodic inspection, considering reliability and costs. A Markov chain is used to define possible states, their transition probabilities and the mean time to system failure, {{as a function of}} the time <b>interval</b> <b>between</b> inspections. Given the mean time to system failure, the steady state availability is determined. Finally, the costs related to the system maintenance are established and a cost function is developed and optimized for the time <b>interval</b> <b>between</b> inspections.

Besides optimizing the time <b>interval</b> <b>between</b> inspections, the analyses also reveal the effect of repair time on system availability and mean time to system failure...|$|R
