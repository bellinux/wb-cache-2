40|$|The present {{manuscript}} {{discusses the}} time–emotion paradox in time psychology: although humans {{are able to}} accurately estimate time as if they possess a specific mechanism {{that allows them to}} measure time (i. e. an internal clock), their representations of time are easily distorted by the context. Indeed, our sense of time depends on intrinsic context, such as the emotional state, and on extrinsic context, such as the rhythm of others' activity. Existing studies on the relationships between emotion and time suggest that these contextual variations in subjective time do not result from the <b>incorrect</b> <b>functioning</b> of the internal clock but rather from the excellent ability of the internal clock to adapt to events in one's environment. Finally, the fact that we live and move in time and that everything, every act, takes more or less time has often been neglected. Thus, there is no unique, homogeneous time but instead multiple experiences of time. Our subjective temporal distortions directly reflect the way our brain and body adapt to these multiple time scales...|$|E
40|$|B {{cells are}} an {{important}} component of adaptive immunity. They produce and secrete millions of different antibody molecules, each of which recognizes a different (foreign) antigen. The fact that humans express a very large repertoire of antibodies is due to the complex mechanism of V(D) J recombination of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes as well as other processes including somatic hypermutation, gene conversion and class switching. The B cell receptor (BCR) is an integral membrane protein complex that is composed of two Ig heavy chains, two Ig light chains and two heterodimers of Igalpha and Igbeta. To eliminate foreign antigens, B cells cooperate with other cells of the immune system including macrophages, dendritic cells and T cells. B cell development is a tightly controlled process in which over 75 % of the developing cells become apoptotic because of inappropriate immunoglobulin gene rearrangements or recognition of self antigens by Igs. Hence, the majority of B cell-associated disorders are caused by the <b>incorrect</b> <b>function</b> of genes/proteins involved in B cell development...|$|R

The radiation {{has a negative}} influence on electronics {{and can lead to}} the <b>incorrect</b> <b>functioning</b> of complex control and diagnostic system designed for HEP machines. Therefore, in most cases the electronic equipments is installed in radiation-safe areas, but in some cases this rule is omitted to decrease costs of the project. The European X-ray Free Electron Laser (E-XFEL), being under construction at DESY research center, is a good example. The E-XFEL uses single tunnel and part of the electronic system will be installed next to main beam pipe and exposed to radiation. The modern Advanced/Micro Telecommunications Computing Architecture (ATCA/µTCA) standards are foreseen as a base for control and diagnostic system for this new project. These flexible standards provide high reliability, availability and usability for the system which can be decreased by negative influence of parasitic radiation field. The additional shielding will be introduced to protect racks with electronics, but during commissioning and, in case of control systems errors, the assumed radiation levels can be exceeded. Therefore, it is highly recommended to monitor doses absorbed by electronics. Moreover, it could be helpful for estimating system lifetime, scheduling maintenance periods and protecting machine from unexpended failures.

Material y métodos: Estudio descriptivo retrospectivo multicéntrico, de 79 meses de duración. Se estudiaron todos los catéteres colocados en dos unidades de diálisis peritoneal. El análisis se realizó con el paquete estadístico IBM SPSS Statistics 19. 0, estableciendo el nivel de significación en p Introduction: The aim of {{the study}} was to compare the surgical, {{mechanical}} and infectious complications presented by self-locating catheters compared to other types of Tenckhoff catheters, and to compare the survival of both types of catheter. Material and methods: Multicentre retrospective descriptive study lasting 79 months. All the catheters placed in two peritoneal dialysis units were studied. The analysis was carried out using the IBM SPSS Statistics 19. 0 statistical package, setting the significance level at p< 0. 05. Results: The sample was made up of 241 catheters in 202 patients, of whom 52. 5 % were men (n= 106). The average age was 61. 98 + 15. 87 years. The most used catheter was the self-locating catheter with 63. 5 % (n= 153). Surgical complications. Surgical complications were only described in 28. 1 % of the self-locating catheters (p< 0. 001). Mechanical complications. These were more frequent with the self-locating catheter, except for displacement, and were only significant for leaks (p= 0. 003). Infections. A total of 196 peritoneal infections took place in 116 catheters, with a rate of 0. 691 + 0. 87 episode per patient per year. Of these, 45. 1 % occurred in self-locating catheters, with no significant differences (p= 0. 214). Causes for withdrawal. Leaving PD represented 45. 6 % of the catheter withdrawals, 10 % were due to peritoneal infection and 6. 6 % due to <b>incorrect</b> <b>function.</b> The self-locating catheter was removed in more cases due to leaks, peritoneal infections and <b>incorrect</b> <b>function.</b> Survival of the catheters. We did not find differences in the survival of the catheters (Log-Rank Mantel Cox = 0, 164). Discussion: Self-locating catheters had a higher number of surgical and mechanical complications than the Tenckhoff catheters, with no differences found in respect of infectious complications. We found a lower survival compared to the Tenckhoff catheters without statistical significance.

Also parts of the safety and ignition (S&I) device were found in the flare magazine. Because of the potential risk the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) asked TNO to investigate the risks, possible causes and solutions for these problems during flare ejection. After preliminary research the cause of the problems was found in the functioning of the BBU- 36 /B impulse cartridges. Due to <b>incorrect</b> <b>functioning</b> of the cartridge the acceleration of the flare pellet out of its casing is too slow. Hot gasses from the impulse cartridges are then able to bypass the S&I device and ignite the flare inside the casing. An experiment was performed to determine the “worst case” damage caused by in-casing ignition of multiple flares. The BBU- 36 /B impulse cartridges have been characterized by performance tests in a closed vessel and an acceleration test. Pressure curves and high-speed video images showed that the actual performance of the impulse cartridge was strongly dependant on the test applied. It was learned that, in contrast to the acceleration test, the conventional closed vessel test does not reflect the behaviour of an impulse cartridge in reality. Flares were characterized in relation to the force needed to push the flare pellet out of the casing. It was found that certain combinations of impulse cartridge and flare lots were responsible for the high number of in-casing flare ignitions during flight...|$|E
40|$|Real-time {{systems are}} amongst the most safety {{critical}} systems involving computer software and the <b>incorrect</b> <b>functioning</b> of this software can cause great damage, {{up to and}} including the loss of life. If seems sensible therefore to write real-time software in a way that gives us the best chance of correctly implementing specifications. Because of the high level of functional programming languages, their semantic simplicity and their amenability to formal reasoning and correctness preserving transformation it thus seems natural to use a functional language for this task. This thesis explores the problems of applying functional programming languages to real-time by defining the real-time functional programming language Ruth. The first part of the thesis concerns the identification of the particular problems associated with programming real-time systems. These can broadly be stated as a requirement that a real-time language must be able to express facts about time, a feature we have called time expressibility. The next stage is to provide time expressibility within a purely functional framework. This is accomplished by the use of timestamps on inputs and outputs and by providing a real-time clock as an input to Ruth programs. The final major part of the work is the construction of a formal definition of the semantics of Ruth to serve as a basis for formal reasoning and transformation. The framework within which the formal semantics of a real-time language are defined requires time expressibility {{in the same way as}} the real-time language itself. This is accomplished within the framework of domain theory by the use of specialised domains for timestamped objects, called herring-bone domains. These domains could be used as the basis for the definition of the semantics of any real-time language...|$|E

It is used for people whose symptoms include issues in the orofacial region, especially of the motoric and structural nature. This category includes people with Down syndrome whom whole-body hypotonia is characteristic of, thus including the orofacial region and consequently orofacial dysfunctions. In the theoretical part, Down syndrome and myofunctional therapy are introduced. The characteristics of the syndrome, including anatomical peculiarities of the orofacial region, are described. The characteristic of people with DS is muscle flaccidity, worse proprioception, which results in difficulties performing motoric movements. In this part, the anatomy of the orofacial region of people without anatomical peculiarities is introduced. Moreover, other causes that can lead to <b>incorrect</b> <b>functioning</b> of the muscles of the orofacial region are listed and described. Furthermore, it contains the introduction of myofunctional therapy, its beginnings, pursued goals (its main goal is eliminating harmful habits and changing movement patterns, and consequently the structure of the orofacial region itself), and when it is appropriate to use it. Different types of myofunctional therapy are listed and described, along with an explanation when to use which type. Various tools {{that can be used for}} myofunctional therapy are introduced. The theoretical part is derived from the German theory on myofunctional therapy. In the empirical part, qualitative research methods are used. With a singular case study a girl with Down syndrome is analysed and introduced. The purpose of the case study is explaining her example. The focus is on the motorics of the orofacial region and the implementation of exercises to improve the motorics of this region. The exercises and instructions on their proper performance are partially made and prepared by me, and partially taken from foreign literature (Kittel, 2014; Kittel, Förster, 2015, and Türk, Söhlermann, Rummel, 2012). During the 10 days (20 th to 29 th of July, 2016) I resided with the family, the exercises have been performed twice a day, in the morning and in the evening, for 20 minutes respectively or more specifically for as long as the girl was motivated and ready to take part in them. According to the girl's specifics, 10 different exercises have been selected. The exercises aim at improving nose breathing, the motorics of the lips and the tongue, as well as the coordination of the whole body. In conclusion, the exercises help to improve self-awareness, the ability to perform the exercises, and the girl paid more attention to the tonus. The results would be much better and more accurate if the exercises were performed for a longer period of time. It would also be more optimal if there was more time between the last time the exercises have been performed and he evaluation of the improvement. This way it could be observed whether the girl remembered and performed the exercises even when we did not meet or when she was automating movements. ...|$|E

It is important because interval schedules model a significant feature of the world: the dependence of reinforcement on factors beyond the organism's control. The problem remains unsolved because no feedback function yet proposed satisfies all the theoretical and empirical requirements. Previous suggestions that succeed in fitting data fail theoretically because they violate a newly recognized theoretical requirement: The slope of the function must approach or equal 1. 0 at the origin. A function is presented that satisfies all requirements but lacks any theoretical justification.
