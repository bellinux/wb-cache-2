40|$|In {{order to}} improve copper {{leaching}} efficiency from the {{flexible printed circuit board}} (PCB) by Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, it is necessary to quantitatively measure the bacteria bioleaching copper under extreme acidic condition from <b>flexible</b> <b>PCB.</b> The inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) is a very accurate way to analyze metals in solution; this paper investigated the optimal conditions for copper bioleaching by Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans from <b>flexible</b> <b>PCB</b> through ICP-AES. The conditions included particle size of <b>flexible</b> <b>PCB</b> powder, quantity of <b>flexible</b> <b>PCB</b> powder, initial pH of culture medium, bacteria inoculation, bacteria activation time, and quantity of FeSO 4 · 7 H 2 O.

For resistors, capacitors and inductors technological turnkey solutions are offered by major manufacturers and also novel technologies are under development. Application examples for passives integration into <b>flexible</b> <b>PCBs</b> will be given. A further boost of functionality will be accomplished by the integration of active chips into the board. An overview of different approaches and the respective sets of enabling technologies for the integration of chips into the board will be given. Two of the approaches for the chip integration into the board {{will be discussed in}} detail. A prerequisite for those technologies is the chip thinning, which is now available as a commercial service for chip thicknesses down to 20 µm. In the chip in polymer (CIP) approach the thin chip is precisely positioned and soundly attached onto the board surface. After lamination of a copper coated resin foil via contacts are drilled through the laminate to the contact pads of the chip. The transfer of precise chip position parameters with respect to the board is essential for this step. The wiring on the laminate foil to the chip and to other components is subsequently structured. Process parameters and results will be presented. For the embedding of chips into <b>flexible</b> <b>PCBs</b> the chip is flipped onto the substrate surface and thermode bonded. The process implies soldering. Therefore electroless Ni(P) is deposited onto the Al bond pads of the chip which is subsequently covered with small caps of solder. The solder cap heights are in the range of 4 to 8 µm {{in order to keep the}} interconnection height low. The solder joint is realized by thermode bonding of the chip onto the structured wiring of the substrate using no-flow underfiller.

40|$|Abstract—Over {{the last}} few years, the active and growing {{interest}} in Radiofrequency Identification (RFID) technology has stimulated a conspicuous research activity involving design and realization of passive label-type UHF RFID tags customized for specific applications. In most of the literature, presented and discussed tags are prototyped by using either rough-and-ready procedures or photolithography techniques on rigid Printed Circuit Boards. However, for several reasons, such approaches are not the most recommended, in particular they are rather time-consuming and, moreover, they give rise to low quality devices in one case, and to cumbersome and rigid tags in the other. In this work, two alternative prototyping techniques suitable for cost-effective, time-saving and high-performance built-in-lab tags are introduced and discussed. The former {{is based on the}} joint use of <b>flexible</b> <b>PCBs</b> and solid ink printers. The latter makes use of a cutting plotter to precisely shape the tag antenna on thin copper sheets.

40|$|Thinning down ICs is a {{well-known}} approach to reduce the volume of chip packages. In this work ICs are thinned down to 30 um, followed by a package procedure in polyimide with copper fan out, which allows their embedding in adhesives used for laminating flexible printed circuit boards (PCBs). In this way the chip does not consume PCB area, hence other circuit components can be assembled on top or {{at the bottom of}} the chip, enabling extreme circuit miniaturization. Furthermore, our ultra-thin chip package (UTCP) is highly flexible, enabling flexible electronic circuits without large rigid chip packages. Spin-on photo-definable polyimide precursors are used to build an interposer which can be embedded later in the <b>flexible</b> <b>PCB.</b> The chip is fixed in between three polyimide layers using BCB as adhesive. The central polyimide layer forms a cavity for the chip, the top layer of polyimide is exposed and developed to fabricate vias contacting the chip. An 8 um thick copper layer is deposited and patterned using lithography and etching to form the fan-out, essential to match the fine IC pitch to the larger PCB pitch. The final chip package is about 75 um thick, and is easily embedded using only small adaptations of the standard <b>flexible</b> <b>PCB</b> fabrication process. Last year, both the UTCP concept and the embedding in a <b>flexible</b> <b>PCB</b> were optimized in order to obtain a very high yield.

40|$|Small scale {{fabrication}} processes {{have led}} to the advent of very thin flexible devices such as RFID tags, <b>flexible</b> <b>PCBs</b> and smart clothing. In a geometrical sense, these present themselves as curved two dimensional surfaces embedded in a three dimensional domain. When simulating electromagnetic behaviour on these surfaces at low frequencies, a full 3 D field model is not always necessary. Using 3 D algorithms to solve these problems can result in {{a large portion of the}} computer memory and runtime being used to mesh and simulate areas of the domain that present little electromagnetic activity. The theme of this thesis is concerned with the improvement of the runtime and memory consumption of electromagnetic simulations of these surfaces. The main contributions of this work are presented as an investigation into the feasibility of applying a 2 D Unstructured Transmission Line Modelling method (UTLM) simulation to open, curved surfaces embedded in 3 D space, by providing a one-to-one mapping of the geometry to a 2 D flat plane. First, an investigation into the various methods of how a computer represents unstructured meshes in its memory is presented, and how this affects the runtime of the simulation. The underlying mesh data structures used to represent the geometrical problem space can have a huge impact on the efficiency and memory consumption of the simulation. This investigation served to demonstrate that it is not just simply the optimisation of the simulation algorithms that facilitate improvements to the runtime and memory consumption of a simulation. How a computer understands the connectivity of the mesh can have far greater impacts to the computational resources available. The concepts of surface parameterisation are then introduced; a process of mapping curved surfaces embedded in a three dimensional domain to a flat two dimensional plane. By providing a one-to-one mapping of the geometry from the 3 D domain to the 2 D flat plane, a low frequency 2 D unstructured TLM simulation can be applied, negating the need for 3 D algorithms. Because this mapping is one-to-one, the results of the simulation can then be mapped back to 3 D space for visualisation. Parameterisations will almost always introduce distortion to angle and area, and minimising this distortion is paramount to maintaining an accurate simulation. Test cases were used to measure the extent of this distortion, and the investigation concluded that Angle Based Flattening (ABF) and Least Squares Conformal Mapping (LSCM) methods resulted in the best quality parameterisations. Simulations were then conducted on these test cases as a demonstration of how UTLM can be performed on 2 D surfaces, embedded in a 3 D domain...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The demands {{toward the}} {{development}} of simple and cost-effective fabrication methods of metallic structures with high lateral resolution on different substrates - applied in many fields of technology, such as in microelectronics, optoelectronics, micromechanics {{as well as in}} sensor and actuator applications - gave the idea to perform this research. Due to its simplicity, laser-assisted chemical liquid-phase deposition (LCLD) has been investigated and applied for the metallization of surfaces having practical importance (Si, GaAs, SiO 2, Si 3 N 4, etc.) {{since the beginning of the}} 80 s. By the invention of novel substrates (polyimide, porous silicon), it was adequate to work out new precursors or just adopt old ones and optimise LCLD in order to fabricate metallic micro-patterns upon these materials for various purposes. According to the motivations mentioned above, LCLD was utilized for the fabrication of palladium (Pd) micro-patterns on polyimide (PI), polyimide/copper flexible printed circuit boards (PCBs), fused silica (SiO 2) and silicon (Si). The selective metallization of porous silicon (PS) has been carried out with nickel (Ni). Depending on the types of lasers, either the focusing (Ar+ laser beam) or diaphragm projection (KrF and XeCl excimer laser pulses) method was employed. In the course of the work, various precursors of the corresponding metals have been investigated and utilized. In the beginning, the pyrolytic decomposition of palladium-amine complex ions ([Pd(NH 3) 4] 2 +) on PI by a scanned and focused Ar+ laser beam was optimised and discussed. Thick (up to several micrometers) and narrow (~ 10 μm) Pd conductor lines with electrical conductivity close to that of the bulk were obtained. In the continuation of these investigations, the precursor was developed further. [Pd(NH 3) 4] 2 + was mixed with the solution of formaldehyde (HCOH) in order to induce the reduction of the metal complex ions. To our knowledge, we were the first - so far - who applied this solution and described the reaction. With the proper choice of the laser parameters, thin Pd films as catalyst layers for electroless copper plating were deposited utilizing Ar+ and excimer lasers as well. The chemically plated copper deposits - upon the obtained Pd film - have excellent electrical and good mechanical properties. In the second part of the thesis, three practical applications (metallization of via holes drilled in PI/Cu <b>flexible</b> <b>PCBs,</b> end-mirror fabrication on single-mode optical fibers, and carbon nanotube growth on Pd activated Si and Si/SiO 2 substrates) of Pd LCLD were realized. The previously presented [Pd(NH 3) 4] 2 + and [Pd(NH 3) 4] 2 +/HCOH precursors were employed for creating the catalyst Pd layers for the carbon nanotube chemical vapor-phase deposition and for the autocatalytic electroless chemical copper plating, respectively. Finally, a simple novel method was introduced for the area-selective metallization of PS. Since the surface of PS reduces spontaneously most metals from their aqueous solutions, it is difficult to realize localized metal deposition from liquid-phase precursors on it. We proposed the application of a stable Ni plating bath from which the metal deposits only when the PS is irradiated with photons having wavelength shorter than 689 nm, thus making possible an area-selective laser-assisted metal deposition. The deposited metal structures and patterns were analysed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) equipped with energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), by the milling and imaging modes of a focused ion beam system (FIB), optical microscopy, profilometry, resistance, and by reflectance measurements...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{method of}} extracting a {{conservative}} thermal model from an existing PCB assembled converter is investigated. This improves upon thermal management by increasing the thermal management contribution of the PCB itself. A thermal calibration loop is proposed in which a given converter is analyzed and data extracted, {{in order to create}} a thermal map of the surface tem-perature from which the component layout and thermal profiles can be estimated. Thermal figures of merit are vital to quantify the thermal adjustments, recorded in this thermal map, which are required during thermal calibration. The thermal figures of merit are also flexible enough to allow for specific optimization objectives such as high power density, or overall reliability. Two graphical means to predict temperature profiles required in the thermal cal-ibration loop have been investigated: a thermal resistor network method with a purely analytical approach, suitable for relatively small systems where the geometry and loss analysis are simple (fewer than ten components), or a more elaborate method using a finite difference method algorithm, implemented in a spreadsheet environment.

40|$|Realizing {{electronic}} {{systems that are}} conformal with curved or complex surfaces is difficult if not impossible with conventional fabrication techniques, which require rigid, two dimensional, printed circuit boards (<b>PCB).</b> <b>Flexible</b> copper based fabrication is widely available commercially providing conformance, but not simultaneously stiffness. As a result, these systems are susceptible to reliability problems if repeatedly bent or stretched. The integration of Additive Manufacturing (AM) combined with Direct Print (DP) micro-dispensing can produce shapes of arbitrary and complex form that also allows for 1) miniature cavities for insetting electronic components and 2) conductive traces for electrical interconnect between components. The fabrication freedom introduced by AM techniques such as stereolithography, ultrasonic consolidation (UC), and fused deposition modeling (FDM) have only recently been explored {{in the context of}} electronics integration.

Bond wire technology, laser machining technology and photolithography technology are adopted to fabricate the strain sensor, in which the wire bonding technology is the most significant process for this design. An array of 25 micrometer bond wires that are normally employed for electrical connections in integrated circuits is built to create an interdigitated structure and generating approximately 10 pF capacitance.

40|$|Miniaturization {{of modern}} {{electronic}} devices has greatly increased {{the demand for}} advanced substrates for high-density applications, fine pitch attachment processes, and high-speed applications. <b>Flexible</b> polyimide (PI) <b>PCBs</b> have been popular in electronics packaging due to their pliability and good reliability at elevated temperatures. However, high moisture absorption of PI films may cause reliability issues in harsh conditions. Therefore, {{it is critical to}} understand the behavior of PI PCBs under such conditions. The aim of this work was to study the reliability of PI substrates using three accelerated life tests (ALTs) to examine possible reliability issues of PI under demanding conditions. A thermal cycling (T/C) test (- 40 °C/ 125 °C) was performed for 5000 cycles. A high humidity test (85 °C / 85 % RH) was performed for 4000 hours and the effect of corrosive humid environment was studied in a salt spray test for 4500 hours. Four test structures were used to study the reliability of the PI substrates. The reliability of flip chip attachment was studied using anisotropic conductive adhesive (ACA). The reliability of vias in PI substrate was also studied. Additionally, the stability of the dielectric properties of PI was studied using a parallel plated capacitor structure. Finally, meander structures were used to study the reliability of wiring on the PI substrates. The results showed that copper wirings on the PI PCB were highly reliable under temperature cycling and humid conditions. This revealed that 40 % failures of the via struc-tures in the thermal cycling test were most likely caused by the via structures instead of the wiring in between them. However, the vias were not affected in the humid condi-tion. This showed that application of PI film for multilayer PCBs, where the vias are needed to interconnect the layers, might undergo reliability issues under service condi-tions with temperature cycling. However, PI film for multilayer PCBs would show high reliability under humid conditions. Moreover, the PI film was found to be a reliable substrate for chip attachment applications under temperature and humidity stresses. That is, flexible PI substrate are promising PCBs for fine pitch application. In addition, PI film as a dielectric was found to exhibit better electrical properties with lower dielectric constant after exposure to temperature cycling condition. However, high moisture ab-sorption of PI deteriorated the dielectric property of PI film by increasing its dielectric constant value. This showed that the PI substrates in high-speed applications are reliable under service conditions with cyclic temperature stresses. However, the functionality of the PI PCB may be declined in humid conditions. In this study, the harsh condition of the salt spray test considerably deteriorated the reliability of all PI test structures...|$|R

The tactile sensor arrays feature <b>flexible</b> <b>PCB</b> substrates and/or flexible conductive composite polymer (CCP) structures, resulting in highly flexible tactile arrays. Each switch consists of 4 elements: fascia, target, spacer and a sensor coil. The user presses the fascia, bringing the target in contact with the sensor coil. In the first method, where the system operates based on the principle of eddy current generation, movement of the conductive target changes the inductance of a sensing coil. In the second method, the contact between the target and the conductive membrane triggers a touch detect in the detection mechanism. An electronic circuit that accurately measures inductances is developed to detect the change in the inductance of each sensor’s coil when the user presses the target element of the sensor. Different sizes and geometries of coils in both <b>flexible</b> <b>PCB</b> metal and CCP are investigated to determine which couple best with the CCP that forms the target for the inductive coils.

40|$|A novel {{system to}} control robotic/prosthetic limbs with a tongue-based scheme is {{presented}} in this paper. In the proposed system six off-the-self pressure sensors soldered on a <b>flexible</b> <b>PCB</b> {{and placed in the}} inner part of cuspides, central and lateral incisors of the lower arch, are interfaced with electronics and wireless transmitters to form the complete system. The control system sends the appropriate commands to the prosthesis when users apply force to one of the pressure sensors with their tongue. Each pressure sensor represents one gesture for the prosthesis. The touch with the tongue results in an increase of the read pressure by the sensor. If the pressure exceeds a predetermined threshold the prosthesis is activated via wireless transmission of data. To package the system in the mouth a protective encapsulation was made using PDMS. Different thicknesses and concentrations of PDMS were tested to determine the optimum trade-off between the minimum exerted force by the user that activates the prosthesis and the threshold below which the prosthesis is not active...|$|E
40|$|Miniaturized {{low-power}} artificial compound {{eyes in a}} small {{form factor}} and a low payload can be a promising approach to provide wide-field information for micro-air-vehicle (MAV) applications. Recently, research efforts {{have been made to}} realize bio-inspired artificial compound eyes to mimic the wide field of view (FoV) of insect visual organs by implementing photoreceptors to independently face different angles [1 - 2]. However, these approaches have drawbacks. They use complicated fabrication processes to form a hemispherical lens configuration and secure an independent optical path to each photoreceptor. We take a simple and practical approach to realize wide-field optic flow sensing in a pseudo-hemispherical configuration by mounting a number of 2 D array optic flow sensors on a <b>flexible</b> <b>PCB</b> module as shown in Figure 7. 2. 1. In this scheme, the 2 D optic flow sensor should meet the requirements of MAV applications: extremely low power consumption while maintaining robust optic flow generation. Conventional optic flow algorithms, such as Lucas-and-Kanade, require huge amounts of numerical calculations; therefore, they requir...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A 2. 5 mW {{wireless}} {{flight control}} system for cyborg moths is presented, consisting of a 3 -to- 5 GHz non-coherent pulsed ultra-wideband receiver system-on-chip with an integrated 4 -channel pulse-width modulation stimulator mounted on a 1. 5 cm by 2. 6 cm printed circuit board. The highly duty cycled, energy detection receiver requires 0. 5 -to- 1. 4 nJ/bit and achieves a sensitivity of 76 dBm at a data rate of 16 Mb/s (10 BER). A multi-stage inverter-based RF front end with resonant load and differential signal chain allow for robust, low energy operation. Digital calibration {{is used in the}} baseband amplifier, ADC and DLL to cancel voltage and timing offsets. Through the use of a <b>flexible</b> <b>PCB</b> and 3 -D die stacking, the total weight of the electronics is kept to 1 g, within the carrying capacity of an adult Manduca sexta moth. Preliminary wireless flight control of a moth in a wind tunnel is demonstrated.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a low power wireless acquisition module for use within wearable health monitoring systems and Ambient Assisted Living applications. The acquisition module provides continuous {{monitoring of the}} user's electrocardiogram (ECG) and activity, {{as well as the}} local temperature at the module. The module is placed on the chest of the user, and its wearability is achieved due to its fabrication based on a <b>flexible</b> <b>PCB,</b> and by the complete absence of connecting wires, {{as a result of the}} integration of flexible and dry ECG monitoring electrodes on the acquisition module, which do not require preparation with electrolyte gel. The design of the acquisition module also aimed for the minimization of power consumption to enable long-term continuous monitoring, namely concerning the wireless link, for which a proprietary low power solution was adopted. A low power analog frontend was custom designed for single-lead ECG monitoring, achieving a current consumption of 220 ?A. The wireless acquisition module has a current consumption down to 1. 3 mA while processing the acquisition of sensor data, and 4 mA when the wireless transceiver is active...|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes an {{advanced}} Si 3 N 4 ceramic-based structure with through vias designed {{and filled with}} brazing alloy as a reliable interconnect solution in planar power modules. Finite element (FE) modeling and simulation were first used to predict the potential of using the proposed Si 3 N 4 ceramic-based structure to improve the heat dissipation and reliability of planar interconnects. Power cycling tests and non-destructive microstructural characterization were then performed on Si 3 N 4 ceramic-based structures, flexible printed circuit boards (PCB) and conventional Al wire interconnect samples to evaluate the FE predictions. Both the FE simulations and experimental tests were carried out on single Si diode samples where both the ceramic-based structures and flexible PCBs were bonded on the top sides of Si diodes with eutectic Sn- 3. 5 Ag solder joints. The results obtained demonstrate that Si 3 N 4 ceramic-based structures can significantly improve the reliability of planar interconnects. The experimental average lifetimes and FE simulated maximum creep strain accumulations for the ceramic-based structure and <b>flexible</b> <b>PCB</b> interconnect samples can reasonably be fitted to existing lifetime models for Sn- 3. 5 Ag solder joints. Discrepancies between the models and experimental results {{can be attributed to}} defects and poor filling of the brazing alloy in the vias through the Si 3 N 4 ceramic...|$|E
40|$|The {{reliability}} and mechanical performance of electronic integrated circuit (IC) package is studied {{based on the}} finite element analysis. The flip chip on board (FCOB) package - {{one of the most}} current plastic encapsulated IC packages - consists of a die, solders, a printed circuit board and underfill resin encapsulated between the die and PCB, which is subjected to a typical thermal cycle experienced during the manufacturing process. The effects of viscoelastic properties of underfill resin on mechanical responses and residual stresses of FCOB packages are specifically studied and the results are compared with those obtained for a thermoelastic underfill resin. The viscoelastic properties of underfill resin are characterized using the time-temperature superposition (TTS) technique. Both the rigid and <b>flexible</b> <b>PCB</b> substrates are considered. It is found that the elastic model underestimates significantly both the thermal stress and the strain level in the solder joints, whereas it overestimates the stress concentrations in the underfill fillet around the die corner than the viscoelastic model. When the package is subjected to an extended dwell time at an elevated temperature, a moderate loss of mechanical coupling between the die and organic substrate is expected due to the relaxation of underfill resin. The implication is that the viscoelastic nature of underfill material should be properly taken into account if the failure of solder joints and the lifetime of the package are to be accurately estimated.

Siu et al. have demonstrated a magnetically actuated MEMS microlens scanner assembled with an optical fiber [21]. The microlens scanner is driven by an external AC magnetic field, eliminating chip circuitry, and thermal deformation induced by Joule heating. Duan et al. have demonstrated an electrothermal MEMS actuator for a forward-looking OCT imaging endomicroscope [39]. The probe comprises a fiber-GRIN lens-prism module, a two- axis MEMS mirror whose size is 0.85  mm ×  0.85  mm with <b>flexible</b> <b>PCB,</b> stainless-steel mount, a glass window, and an encapsulation tube. A MEMS mirror is mounted on 45 ° slope after the prism. This endomicroscopic probe has the outer diameter of 5  mm and demonstrates the OCT image of human nail after combining swept-source OCT system as shown in Fig.  5 c. An electrostatic MEMS lens scanner also enables 2 D optical scanning for forward-looking OCT imaging. The probe consists of the MEMS lens scanner, {{a printed circuit board}} (PCB), a GRIN fiber collimator, and objective lens, and an aluminum housing (Fig.  5 d) [13]. The MEMS lens scanner mounted on the PCB was aligned along an optical axis on a silicon fiber groove. The pre-objective design of silicon lens holders and silicon fiber groove becomes compact, facilitates the precise optical alignment, and provides a long working distance. The endomicroscopic catheter has an outer dimension of 7  ×  7  mm with the 5  mm diameter of the objective lens and successfully demonstrates the SD–OCT image of a mouse ear as shown in Fig.  5 d.|$|E
