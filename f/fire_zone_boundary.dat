40|$|Standard time <b>zone</b> <b>boundaries</b> are {{invisible}} in the landscape, yet they abruptly delineate a temporal difference of one hour between two large areas located relative to one another on Earth. In most cases, standard time <b>zone</b> <b>boundaries</b> follow political ones and define areas within which daylight saving time (DST) -the seasonal advancement of standard time by one hour-is observed. Moving time <b>zone</b> <b>boundaries</b> and the decision to observe daylight saving time occurs throughout the world for various reasons that result in the synchronization of socioeconomic and political activities within and between communities and the simultaneous separation from others. The <b>zone</b> <b>boundary</b> between mountain standard time (MST) and central standard time (CST) in the Great Plains of the United States now follows the mostly rectilinear political boundaries of counties and states from the Canadian border in the north t 2 Ì† 7 o the Mexican border in the south. North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, and Texas are bisected by the standard time <b>zone</b> <b>boundary.</b> All Plains states observe DST. Two consequences result from this current configuration: first, communities {{on either side of}} the MST-CST <b>zone</b> <b>boundary</b> are united by time but may not be related by environmental characteristics; and second, that observing or eliininating DST in one state depends upon observance or elimination in neighboring states...|$|R

40|$|Automatic {{identification}} of the necrotic <b>zone</b> <b>boundary</b> {{is important in the}} assessment of treatments on in vitro tumour spheroids. This has been difficult especially when the difference in cell density between the necrotic and viable zones of a tumour spheroid is small. To help overcome this problem, we developed novel one-dimensional pair-correlation functions (PCFs) to provide quantitative estimates of the radial distance of the necrotic <b>zone</b> <b>boundary</b> from the centre of a tumour spheroid. We validate our approach on synthetic tumour spheroids in which the position of the necrotic <b>zone</b> <b>boundary</b> is known a priori. It is then applied to nine real tumour spheroids imaged with light sheet-based fluorescence microscopy. PCF estimates of the necrotic <b>zone</b> <b>boundary</b> are compared with those of a human expert and an existing standard computational method. S. Dini, B. J. Binder, S. C. Fischer, C.

40|$|Based on a {{continuous}} succession of ammonite and calcareous nannofossil assemblages, {{the main purpose}} of this paper is the correlation between ammonite and calcareous nannofossil <b>zone</b> <b>boundaries</b> in two expanded sections from the Basque-Cantabrian area. The ammonite assemblages show clear euroboreal features and allow the identification of Pliensbachian-Toarcian zones and subzones established for NW Europe. Due to the presence of Mediterranean taxa documented at different levels, they are also helpful to improve the biocorrelations between Boreal and Tethyan successions. The calcareous nannofossil assemblage changes provide a useful set of easily recognizable events that facilitate the recognition of all the Pliensbachian-Toarcian zones described for NW Europe and Mediterranean Province. Based on the FO Similiscutum cruciulus (Jamesoni Zone), FO of Lotharingius hauffii (Stokesi/Margaritatus <b>Zone</b> <b>boundary),</b> FO of Carinolithus superbus (Serpentinus Zone), FO of Discorhabdus striatus (Serpentinus/Bifrons <b>Zone</b> <b>boundary)</b> and FO of Retecapsa incompta (Insigne Zone), the NJ 3 /NJ 4, NJ 4 /NJ 5, NJ 5 /NJ 6, NJ 6 /NJ 7 and NJ 7 /NJ 8 <b>Zone</b> <b>boundaries</b> have been recognized. Besides, the NJ 4, the NJ 5 and the NJ 6 span almost the same ammonite-defined time interval in both NW Europe and Basque- Cantabrian area. With respect to the ammonite <b>zone,</b> the <b>zone</b> <b>boundaries</b> NJ 3 /NJ 4 and the NJ 6 /NJ 7 coincides with the NJT 3 /NJT 4 and the NJT 6 /NJT 7 proposed for Mediterranean Province. Instead, the <b>zone</b> <b>boundaries</b> NJ 4 /NJ 5 and the NJ 5 /NJ 6 not coincides with the NJT 4 /NJT 5 and the NJT 5 /NJT 6 proposed for Mediterranean Province.

30|$|In {{order to}} {{effectively}} improve the flexural strength and fracture toughness of ceramics, two methods {{can be used}} to control the growth rate of grain during sintering of ceramic materials by adding a certain amount of (W,Ti)C material. Therefore, on the one hand, the paper simulates the composite ceramic materials based on cellular automata (CA) to optimize the ratio of two formulations. On the other hand, in order to optimize sintering process, CA modeling is also carried out for the sintering process of composite ceramics. Finally, in order to detect the temperature of the <b>firing</b> <b>zone</b> of the ceramic kiln by using the characteristics of the flame image of the <b>firing</b> <b>zone,</b> the K-means clustering method is used for the color segmentation of the flame image of the <b>firing</b> <b>zone</b> of the ceramic kiln. The experimental results show that the size of the grains is in accordance with the actual situation of the simulation and the microstructure evolution of the composites can be simulated well by using the CA theory to simulate the composites; with the increase of simulation time, the grain size distribution is basically unchanged, which accords with the normal distribution, and the simulation process of grain growth is very stable. Based on the K-mean clustering segmentation method, the segmentation of the flame image of ceramic kiln <b>firing</b> <b>zone</b> is realized. This method also provides a good technical means for feature extraction of flame image in ceramic kiln <b>firing</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|R
