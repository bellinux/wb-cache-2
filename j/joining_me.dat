2500|$|OWN {{canceled}} The Rosie Show on March 16, 2012, {{with the}} last show taped March 20, {{on the eve of}} O'Donnell's 50th birthday. The final show aired on OWN on March 29, 2012. In a statement, Oprah Winfrey said [...] "I thank Rosie {{from the bottom of my}} heart for <b>joining</b> <b>me</b> on this journey. She has been an incredible partner, working to deliver the best possible show every single day. As I have learned in the last 15 months, a new network launch is always a challenge and ratings grow over time as you continue to gather an audience. I'm grateful to Rosie and the dedicated Rosie Show team for giving it their all." [...] O'Donnell responded to the cancellation by thanking her viewers and the host city of Chicago: [...] "I loved working with Oprah in the amazing city of Chicago. I was welcomed with open arms and will never forget the kindness of all I encountered. It was a great year for me—I wish the show was able to attract more viewers—but it did not. So I am headed back to my home in New York—with gratitude. On we go!" ...|$|E

60|$|Jack led me {{gently to}} my bed, and, seating {{me on the}} edge of it, sat down beside me. I at once {{perceived}} from their looks that they all thought me mad, and felt the necessity of calming me before taking more forcible measures. This tickled me so much that I laughed again heartily, insomuch that Jack could not help <b>joining</b> <b>me.</b> Suddenly a thought flashed into my mind. My heart leaped to my throat, and I glanced downwards. It was there! I seized Jack's right leg, tumbled him back into the bed, and laying the limb across my knee, grasped it violently.|$|E

There are too many mysteries here for any two sane men." [...] (Here Jack murmured we weren't men, but boys.) [...] "There's the running away and not being caught--the ship ready to sail the moment we arrive; there's your <b>joining</b> <b>me</b> after all your good advice; there's that horrible fight, and the lions, and Edwards, and the sinking of our ship, and the--the--in short, I feel that I'm mad still. I'm not {{recovered}} yet. Here, Jack, take care of me!" ...|$|E

60|$|Over {{against my}} tenting place {{a colony of}} herons had their nests in some dark hemlocks. They were {{interesting}} as a camp of gypsies, some going off in straggling bands to the coast at daybreak, others frogging in the streams, and a few solitary, patient, philosophical ones <b>joining</b> <b>me</b> daily in following the gentle art of Izaak Walton. And then, when the sunset came and the deep red glowed just behind the hemlocks, and the gypsy bands came home, I would see their sentinels posted here and there among the hemlock tips--still, dark, graceful silhouettes etched in sepia against the gorgeous after-glow--and hear the mothers croaking their ungainly babies {{to sleep in the}} tree tops.|$|E
60|$|And then he {{explained}} to me what was {{the object of his}} visit. He was quite alone in Jerusalem, as I was myself; and was staying at H- 's hotel. He had heard that I was starting for the Dead Sea, and had called to ask if I objected to his <b>joining</b> <b>me.</b> He had found himself, he said, very lonely; and as he had heard that I also was alone, he had ventured to call and make his proposition. He seemed to be very bashful, and half ashamed of what he was doing; and when he had done speaking he declared himself conscious that he was intruding, and expressed a hope that I would not hesitate to say so if his suggestion were from any cause disagreeable to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{plan for}} <b>joining</b> <b>me</b> at Bayswater comes next. It {{is very well}} {{as far as it}} goes; but it stands sadly in need of a little judicious improvement. There is a serious {{necessity}} (you shall know why presently) for deceiving the parson far more completely than you propose to deceive him. I want him to see the house-maid's face under circumstances which will persuade him that it is your face. And then, going a step further, I want him to see the house-maid leave London, under the impression that he has seen you start on the first stage of your journey to the Brazils. He didn't believe in that journey when I announced it to him this afternoon in the street. He may believe in it yet, if you follow the directions I am now going to give you.|$|E

6000|$|This will do (said he,) {{all that}} a pillow can do. Of Sir Joshua Reynolds he made three requests, which were readily granted; {{to forgive him}} thirty pounds which he had {{borrowed}} of him; to read the Bible; and never to use his pencil on a Sunday. The church service was frequently read to him by some clergyman of his acquaintance. On one of these occasions, when Mr. Nichols was present, he cried out to Mr. Hoole, who was reading the Litany, [...] "Louder, my dear Sir, louder, I entreat you, or you pray in vain;" [...] and when the service was done, he turned to a lady {{who had come to}} pray with him, and said to her with much earnestness, [...] "I thank you, Madam, very heartily, for your kindness in <b>joining</b> <b>me</b> in this solemn service. Live well, I conjure you, and you will not feel the compunction at the last which I now feel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes; but {{confined}} {{to her room}} as usual, I regret to say. Two more sisters of mine, whom you have never seen at all, are also here. They are older {{than any of the}} rest of us, and had, broadly speaking, no education at all, poor girls. The eldest, Gwendoline, is my cook, and Cornelia is my housemaid. I suffer much sadness, and almost misery sometimes, in reflecting that here are we, ten brothers and sisters, born of one father and mother, who might have mixed together and shared all in the same scenes, and been properly happy, {{if it were not for}} the strange accidents that have split us up into sections as you see, cutting me off from them without the compensation of <b>joining</b> <b>me</b> to any others. They are all true as steel in keeping the secret of our kin, certainly; but that brings little joy, though some satisfaction perhaps.' ...|$|E
60|$|He made {{no great}} show of sympathy {{with people in}} their anxieties, but it never failed, {{and at a time}} when I lay sick for many weeks his letters were of comfort to those who feared I might not rise again. His hand was out in help for those who needed help, and in {{kindness}} for those who needed kindness. There remains in my mind the dreary sense of a long, long drive to the uttermost bounds of the South End at Boston, where he went to call upon some obscure person whose claim stretched in a lengthening chain from his early days in Missouri--a most inadequate person, in whose vacuity the gloom of the dull day deepened till it was almost too deep for tears. He bore the ordeal with grim heroism, and silently smoked away the sense of it, as we drove back to Cambridge, in his slippered feet, sombrely musing, sombrely swearing. But he knew he had done the right, the kind thing, and he was content. He came the whole way from Hartford to go with me to a friendless play of mine, which Alessandro Salvini was giving in a series of matinees to houses never enlarging themselves beyond the count of the brave two hundred who sat it through, and he stayed my fainting spirit with a cheer beyond flagons, <b>joining</b> <b>me</b> in my joke at the misery of it, and carrying the fun farther.|$|E

60|$|Instead {{of finding}} amusement, {{as we had}} expected, in Owen's studio, she {{puckered}} up her pretty face in grimaces of disgust at the smell of paint in the room, and declared that {{the horrors of the}} Earthquake at Lisbon made her feel hysterical. Instead of showing a total want of interest in my business occupations on the estate, she destroyed my dignity as steward by <b>joining</b> <b>me</b> in my rounds on her pony, with her vagabond retinue at her heels. Instead of devouring the novels I had ordered for her, she left them in the box, and put her feet on it when she felt sleepy after a hard day's riding. Instead of practicing for hours every evening at the piano, which I had hired with such a firm conviction of her using it, she showed us tricks on the cards, taught us new games, initiated us into the mystics of dominoes, challenged us with riddles, an even attempted to stimulate us into acting charades--in short, tried every evening amusement in the whole category except the amusement of music. Every new aspect of her character was a new surprise to us, and every fresh occupation that she chose was a fresh contradiction to our previous expectations. The value of experience as a guide is unquestionable in many of the most important affairs of life; but, speaking for myself personally, I never understood the utter futility of it, where a woman is concerned, until I was brought into habits of daily communication with our fair guest.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are English," [...] he said, in the lingua-franca {{which was}} the medium of {{communication}} between the Eastern and Western peoples in those days. [...] "You are brave warriors, and I hear that before you were taken you slaughtered numbers of my people. They did wrong to capture you and bring you here to be killed. Your cruel king gives no mercy to those who fall into his hands. You must not expect it here, you who without a pretence of right invade my country, slaughter my people, and defeat my armies. The murder of the prisoners of Acre has closed my heart to all mercy. There, your king put 10,000 prisoners to death in cold blood, {{a month after the}} capture of the place, because the money at which he had placed their ransom had not arrived. We Arabs do not carry huge masses of gold about with us; and although I could have had it brought from Egypt, I did not think that so brave a monarch as Richard of England could have committed so cruel an action in cold blood. When we are fresh from battle, and our wounds are warm, and our hearts are full of rage and fury, we kill our prisoners; but to do so weeks after a battle is contrary to the laws alike of your religion and of ours. However, it is King Richard who has sealed your doom, not I. You are knights, and I do not insult you with the offer of turning from your religion and <b>joining</b> <b>me.</b> Should one of you wish to save his life on these conditions, I will, however, promise him a place of position and authority among us." ...|$|E
60|$|The person it {{appeared}} least to concern proved to be, till dinner, little Miles himself. My perambulations had given me, meanwhile, no glimpse of him, {{but they had}} tended to make more public the change taking place in our relation {{as a consequence of}} his having at the piano, the day before, kept me, in Flora's interest, so beguiled and befooled. The stamp of publicity had of course been fully given by her confinement and departure, and the change itself was now ushered in by our nonobservance of the regular custom of the schoolroom. He had already disappeared when, on my way down, I pushed open his door, and I learned below that he had breakfasted--in the presence of a couple of the maids--with Mrs. Grose and his sister. He had then gone out, as he said, for a stroll; than which nothing, I reflected, could better have expressed his frank view of the abrupt transformation of my office. What he would not permit this office to consist of was yet to be settled: there was a queer relief, at all events--I mean for myself in especial--in the renouncement of one pretension. If so much had sprung to the surface, I scarce put it too strongly in saying that what had perhaps sprung highest was the absurdity of our prolonging the fiction that I had anything more to teach him. It sufficiently stuck out that, by tacit little tricks in which even more than myself he carried out the care for my dignity, I had had to appeal to him to let me off straining to meet him on the ground of his true capacity. He had at any rate his freedom now; I was never to touch it again; as I had amply shown, moreover, when, on his <b>joining</b> <b>me</b> in the schoolroom the previous night, I had uttered, {{on the subject of the}} interval just concluded, neither challenge nor hint. I had too much, from this moment, my other ideas. Yet when he at last arrived, the difficulty of applying them, the accumulations of my problem, were brought straight home to me by the beautiful little presence on which what had occurred had as yet, for the eye, dropped neither stain nor shadow.|$|E
