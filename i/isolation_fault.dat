In order to accomplish gas path <b>fault</b> <b>isolation</b> successfully for a gas turbine engine, both an accurate off-design performance model and an effective <b>fault</b> <b>isolation</b> approach are necessary. In this thesis, two original and useful contributions to knowledge are presented: a new gas turbine off-design performance model adaptation approach and a new gas turbine <b>fault</b> <b>isolation</b> approach. This new adaptation approach uses optimal multiple scaling factors obtained by using a Genetic Algorithm to scale inaccurate component characteristic maps in gas turbine performance models to improve their prediction accuracy in different off-design conditions. The major feature of this approach is that it provides non- linear map scaling and therefore is able to provide more effective adaptation. The new <b>fault</b> <b>isolation</b> approach can be used to discover knowledge hidden in engine fault samples, transfers that knowledge into rules, and then uses those rules for <b>fault</b> <b>isolation.</b> In addition, it is also capable of selecting appropriate measurements for <b>fault</b> <b>isolation,</b> dealing with uncertainty caused by measurement noise. Enhanced fault signatures, which are represented by the measurement deviations and their ranking pattern in terms of magnitude, are developed to make gas turbine faults easier to distinguish and hence make this <b>fault</b> <b>isolation</b> approach more effective. The new adaptation approach was applied to the off-design performance model adaptation of a gas turbine, while the new <b>fault</b> <b>isolation</b> approach was employed for <b>fault</b> <b>isolation</b> in a gas turbine. The results show that the new adaptation approach is very effective in improving the prediction accuracy of off- design performance models and the new <b>fault</b> <b>isolation</b> approach is not only effective in <b>fault</b> <b>isolation</b> but also in selecting measurements for <b>isolation</b> and generating <b>fault</b> <b>isolation</b> rules.

Several existing methods for robust filter synthesis are described to solve the robust model matching problem.

Starting from our previous method for fault detection and isolation (FDI) based on generalized momenta, fault identification is additionally obtained through the H∞-design of a state observer for uncertain systems. For each separate fault channel, the identifier consists of a linear filter driven by the corresponding residual signal. Under the weak assumption of bounded time derivative for the otherwise unknown fault input to be identified, the fault estimation error is shown to be ultimately uniformly bounded, with ultimate bound that can be set arbitrarily small. The information on the type and severity of the fault may then be used for reconfiguring the control strategy. Experimental results on a 2 R planar manipulator are presented.

In this paper, we propose a novel cloud-based architecture for the home network system that achieves security <b>isolation,</b> <b>fault</b> isolation and resource isolation. Specifically, we first create a virtual home server for every household using IaaS.

40|$|Abstract — Consider a {{nonlinear}} {{dynamic system}} affected by possibly concurrent faults (and disturbances). If {{we wish to}} detect and isolate each single fault from all other, possibly concurrent faults and disturbances (i. e., to solve the standard Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) problem), some necessary conditions of differential geometric nature should be satisfied. To deal with cases when these conditions are structurally violated, we introduce a more general class of FDI problems, referred to as Fault Set Detection and Isolation (FSDI), where {{the focus of the}} isolation issue is moved from single to sets of faults. Different formulations of FSDI problems are given, necessary and sufficient conditions for their solution are provided, and the design of a hybrid residual generator is presented. For the case of non-concurrent faults, it is possible to detect and isolate even single faults under weaker necessary conditions, by processing output residuals that solve suitable FSDI problems.
