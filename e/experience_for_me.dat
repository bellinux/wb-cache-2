She appraised of her screen debut: [...] "it {{was a wonderful}} <b>experience</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to be appearing alongside so many established names. It was very exciting although I must admit at first I was a bit daunted by the prospect." [...] The film featured several minor black characters, either as members of Gabriel's family, or as workers aboard the ship. When these roles were cast, complaints were made by black members of the British actors' union to the BBC and the Department of Employment at having been [...] "passed over" [...] in favour of overseas artists. The film was shot from 23 September to 6 November 1992. It was funded in the most part by the BBC, though {{a quarter of the}} budget came from the American Miramax. While Kidron had previously come to dislike directing for major studios when filming My Cousin Vinny for Fox, she found the low budget of Great Moments in Aviation [...] "just as horrendous a compromise". Though originally intended for theatrical release, the film failed to find theatrical distribution. It was first screened at the Cannes Film Festival in 1994, then broadcast in Britain on BBC Two on 11 November 1995. It was released on video in the United States under the alternate title Shades of Fear two years later, on 11 November 1997.|$|E

To a writer in 1972 he commented, [...] "Criticism isn't a new <b>experience</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> Pictures that are now thought of as, forgive the term, classics, weren't all that well thought of at the time they came out."

[...] "It was a tremendous <b>experience</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> since most of those who were regulars at the pub were of a certain age, so I had to be ready to sing anything from huayños to Elvis Presley music and, in my mind, that served me a great deal because, in the final analysis, any music that is well structured—whether it is jazz, opera, or pop—is good music".|$|E

The first article by Pedro et al. (2014) investigates the use of a recommender system across all educational sectors in Portugal. A recommender system recognises us when we return to sites previously visited such as booksellers and music download sites. They are responsive to our personal interests and offer recommendations that are aligned to our previous online transactions. Use of recommender systems in educational contexts is less common. This article explores an early implementation of a recommender system in four institutions from elementary to university level. Preliminary results highlight that the younger the learner, the more responsive they are to recommendations. Next, a study by Kear, Chetwynd and Jefferis (2014) on social presence explore...|$|R
2500|$|Flying the Bell Airacuda {{was a new}} <b>experience</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> {{since it}} was the first pusher {{aircraft}} I'd ever flown. Its handling characteristics were foreign to anything I had ever had my hands on. Under power it was unstable in pitch, but stable with power off. While flying straight and level, if a correction in pitch was required, a forward push on the control resulted in the airplane wanting to pitch over even more. Pitch control became a matter of continually jockeying the controls, however slightly, even when the aircraft was in proper trim. The same applied if pulling back on the control. It would tend to continue pitching up, requiring an immediate corrective response. The same happened in a turn with power off, the Bell became stable in pitch. This was fortunate because during approach and landing, it was very stable, and a nice flying airplane." ...|$|E

2500|$|During filming, {{fourteen}} different {{horses were}} used as the main horse character Joey, eight of them portraying him as an adult animal, four as a colt and two as foals; four horses played the other main equine character, Topthorn. Up to 280 horses were used in a single scene. A farrier was on set to replace horseshoes sucked off in the mud during filming, and the horses playing the main horse characters had a specialist equine make-up team, with their coats dyed and markings added to ensure continuity. Equine artist Ali Bannister {{was responsible for the}} 'hair and make-up' of the horses, as well as drawing the sketches of horses that are featured in the film. Extra filming involving a bay foal took place in California in March 2011. Working with horses on this scale was a new experience for Spielberg, who commented: [...] "The horses were an extraordinary <b>experience</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> because several members of my family ride.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to use stories to: (a) explore my formative elementary education growing up in a community that was experiencing poverty, and; (b) to examine the impact and implications of these <b>experiences</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> as a teacher and researcher considering the topic of poverty and education. This study used narrative inquiry to explore stories of education, focusing on experiences living and working in a rural community.

My {{own experiences}} and reflections form the basis of the study, but I used the contributions of secondary participants to offer alternative perspective of my interpretation of events. Participants in this study were asked to write about and/or retell their lived stories of working in areas affected by challenging circumstances.
