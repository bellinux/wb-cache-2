40|$|The Agility Design Study was {{performed}} by the Boeing Defense and Space Group for the NASA Langley Research Center. The objective {{of the study was}} to assess the impact of agility requirements on new fighter configurations. Global trade issues investigated were the level of agility, the mission role of the aircraft (air-to-ground, multi-role, or air-to-air), and whether the customer is Air force, Navy, or joint service. Mission profiles and design objectives were supplied by NASA. An extensive technology assessment was conducted to establish the available technologies to industry for the aircraft. Conceptual level methodology is presented to assess the five NASA-supplied agility metrics. Twelve configurations were developed to address the global trade issues. Three-view drawings, <b>inboard</b> <b>profiles,</b> and performance estimates were made and are included in the report. A critical assessment and lessons learned from the study are also presented...|$|R

40|$|Preliminary {{designs of}} the Bioexplorer spacecraft, {{developed}} {{in an earlier}} study program, are analyzed and updated to conform to a new specification which includes use of both the Scout and the space shuttle vehicle for launch. The updated spacecraft {{is referred to as}} bioresearch module. It is capable of supporting a variety of small biological experiments in near-earth and highly elliptical earth orbits. The baseline spacecraft design is compatible with the Scout launch vehicle. <b>Inboard</b> <b>profile</b> drawings, weight statements, interface drawings, and spacecraft parts and aerospace ground equipment lists are provided to document the design. The baseline design was analyzed to determine the design and cost impact of a set of optional features. These include reduced experiment power and thermal load, addition of an experiment television monitor, and replacement of VHF with S-band communications. The impact of these options on power required, weight change and cost is defined...|$|E
40|$|During {{the design}} of the C & P Aerospace Triton, a few {{problems}} were encountered that necessitated changes in the configuration. After the initial concept phase, the aspect ratio was increased from 7 to 7. 6 to produce a greater lift to drag ratio (L/D = 13) which satisfied the horsepower requirements (118 hp using the Lycoming O- 235 engine). The initial concept had a wing planform area of 134 sq. ft. Detailed wing sizing analysis enlarged the planform area to 150 sq. ft., without changing its layout or location. The most significant changes, however, were made just prior to <b>inboard</b> <b>profile</b> design. The fuselage external diameter was reduced from 54 to 50 inches to reduce drag to meet the desired cruise speed of 120 knots. Also, the nose was extended 6 inches to accommodate landing gear placement. Without the extension, the nosewheel received an unacceptable percentage (25 percent) of the landing weight. The final change in the configuration was made in accordance with the stability and control analysis. In order to reduce the static margin from 20 to 13 percent, the horizontal tail area was reduced from 32. 02 to 25. 0 sq. ft. The Triton meets all the specifications set forth in the design criteria. If time permitted another iteration of the calculations, two significant changes would be made. The vertical stabilizer area would be reduced to decrease the aircraft lateral stability slope since the current value was too high in relation to the directional stability slope. Also, the aileron size would be decreased to reduce the roll rate below the current 106 deg/second. Doing so would allow greater flap area (increasing CL(sub max)) and thus reduce the overall wing area. C & P would also recalculate the horsepower and drag values to further validate the 120 knot cruising speed...|$|E

Of the several design concept papers, {{reports and studies}} that have been written on submarines, no exclusively diesel submarine comparative naval architecture analyses have been published. One possible reason for few submarine studies may be the lack of complete and accurate information regarding the naval architecture of foreign diesel submarines. However, with some fundamental submarine design principles, drawings of <b>inboard</b> <b>profiles</b> and plan views, and key assumptions to develop empirical equations, a process can be developed by which to estimate the submarine naval architectural characteristics. comparative naval architecture analysis creates an opportunity to identify new technologies, review the architectural characteristics best suited for submarine missions and to possibly build more effective submarines. An accurate observation is that submarines designed for different missions possess different capabilities. But are these unique capabilities due to differences in submarine naval architecture? Can mission, cost, or other factors affect the architecture? This study examines and compares the naval architecture of selected diesel submarines from data found in open literature. The goal is to determine weight group estimates and analyze whether these estimates provide a relevant comparison of diesel submarine naval architecture. CIVIN...|$|R

2500|$|The Margarete was a wood framed {{aircraft}} with a high, braced, two spar wing with ply covering {{from the}} front spar to the leading edge and fabric covered aft. The wing had a thick and cambered <b>profile</b> <b>inboard</b> of the tips, which had a thinner and more symmetric profile. [...] Initially the wing plan was rectangular, with triangular ailerons mounted on straight hinges which were attached to the front spar at the tips, reaching the trailing edge inboard. [...] Later, the aileron area was reduced, partly by cropping them inboard and also by tapering their trailing edges and rounding their tips. [...] Each wing was braced from the lower fuselage with an asymmetric, V-form, streamlined strut to the two spars at about one-third span.|$|R
