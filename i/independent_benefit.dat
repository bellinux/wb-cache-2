40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the published clinical {{literature on the}} role of pirfenidone for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). DATA SOURCES: A systematic literature search was performed using the key words pirfenidone or Esbriet, alone and in combination, with IPF or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (expanded using MESH terminology). MEDLINE (1948 -September 2012) was the primary database used for search purposes. In addition, all available articles and abstracts referenced by the articles identified via literature search were included. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: The search was limited to English-language publications. All available clinical trials of pirfenidone pertinent to its pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety were included. DATA SYNTHESIS: Pirfenidone is the first agent specifically developed for the treatment of IPF. It has been approved for use in Europe and Japan, but not in the US. Although Phase 3 trials have shown pirfenidone to improve certain clinical (6 -minute walk test) and functional (change in forced vital capacity) outcomes in patients with IPF, an <b>independent</b> <b>benefit</b> on either mortality or acute exacerbation rates has yet to be demonstrated. Until more definitive supportive data are available, international guidelines have recommended against using pirfenidone to treat most patients with IPF. CONCLUSIONS: Although pirfenidone appears to be an effective treatment for IPF, additional clinical trials are needed to better delineate its risk-benefit profile...|$|E
40|$|Background Host {{factors and}} {{complications}} {{have been associated}} with higher mortality in infective endocarditis (IE). We sought to develop and validate a model of clinical characteristics to predict 6 -month mortality in IE. Methods and Results Using a large multinational prospective registry of definite IE (International Collaboration on Endocarditis [ICE]-Prospective Cohort Study [PCS], 2000 - 2006, n= 4049), a model to predict 6 -month survival was developed by Cox proportional hazards modeling with inverse probability weighting for surgery treatment and was internally validated by the bootstrapping method. This model was externally validated in an independent prospective registry (ICE-PLUS, 2008 - 2012, n= 1197). The 6 -month mortality was 971 of 4049 (24. 0 %) in the ICE-PCS cohort and 342 of 1197 (28. 6 %) in the ICE-PLUS cohort. Surgery during the index hospitalization was performed in 48. 1 % and 54. 0 % of the cohorts, respectively. In the derivation model, variables related to host factors (age, dialysis), IE characteristics (prosthetic or nosocomial IE, causative organism, left-sided valve vegetation), and IE complications (severe heart failure, stroke, paravalvular complication, and persistent bacteremia) were independently associated with 6 -month mortality, and surgery was associated with a lower risk of mortality (Harrell's C statistic 0. 715). In the validation model, these variables had similar hazard ratios (Harrell's C statistic 0. 682), with a similar, <b>independent</b> <b>benefit</b> of surgery (hazard ratio 0. 74, 95 % CI 0. 62 - 0. 89). A simplified risk model was developed by weight adjustment of these variables. Conclusions Six-month mortality after IE is 25 % and is predicted by host factors, IE characteristics, and IE complications. Surgery during the index hospitalization is associated with lower mortality but is performed less frequently in the highest risk patients. A simplified risk model may be used to identify specific risk subgroups in I...|$|E
40|$|Background: Prior {{efforts to}} treat obesity with intragastric {{balloons}} were thwarted by high complication rates. Therefore, fundamental requirements for optimal balloon designs were defined. The {{aim of the}} present study was to investigate the effectiveness, the safety; and the tolerance of a new intragastric balloon. Methods: Adults with treatment-resistant obesity and no GI contraindications to balloon placement were invited to participate in a randomized, double-blind trial of balloon or sham treatment of 3 months' duration. Patients (sham- and balloon-treated groups) in whom a preset weight-loss goal was achieved were given an additional 9 months of balloon treatment. After removal of the balloon at year 1, patients were followed for a second year without the balloon. Results: Forty-three treatment-resistant patients (mean body mass index 43. 3 kg/m(2)) were enrolled. Five patients did not meet the preset weight-loss goal (nonresponse 11. 6 %). Three patients did not tolerate the balloon (7. 0 %), with endoscopy demonstrating severe esophagitis. Three other patients developed esophagitis that was related to use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, albeit prohibited (2 patients), or Substantial weight loss with balloon treatment (1). In intention-to-treat analysis, sham- and balloon-treated groups had a similar mean weight loss of 11. 2 kg (9. 0 %) and 12. 9 kg (10. 4 %), respectively; during the first 3 months. During months 3 to 6, patients who had sham therapy in months 0 to 3 lost 8. 8 kg (7. 9 %) during the first 3 months of balloon treatment. In contrast, patients in the balloon-treatment group lost 3. 9 kg (3. 5 %) during months 3 to 6 (their second balloon treatment period). The overall weight loss was 20 kg (16. 1 %) and 16. 7 kg (13. 4 %) after 6 months in the sham/balloon and in the balloon/balloon treated groups (not significant), respectively. After 1 -year of balloon treatment, a mean weight loss of 21. 3 kg (17. 1 %) was achieved in all patients, of which 12. 6 kg (9. 9 %) was maintained at the end of the second balloon-free year; 47 % of patients sustained a greater than 10 % weight loss, with considerably reduced comorbidity In 33 patients who completed the study per protocol, weight loss was 25. 6 kg (20. 5 %) after 1 year and 14. 6 kg (11. 4 %) after 2 years; 55 % maintained a weight loss of greater than 10 %. Interventional complications occurred in 1. 6 % (2 / 128) and balloon deflations in 2. 3 % (3 / 128). Conclusions: For patients with treatment-resistant obesity; the intragastric balloon appeared to be safe but was not a treatment option in a fifth of patients. Although an <b>independent</b> <b>benefit</b> of balloon treatment beyond diet, exercise, and behavioral therapy could not be demonstrated in the first 3 months, balloon treatment for 1 year resulted in substantial weight loss, the greater part of which was maintained during the balloon-free second yea...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A multi-coupon (MC) {{represents}} {{a collection of}} k coupons that a user can redeem to a vendor {{in exchange for a}} benefit (some good or service). Recently, Chen et al. [CEL+ 07] proposed an unforgeable privacy-protecting multi-coupon scheme (MCS), which discourages sharing of coupons through a property called unsplitta-bility, where the coupons of a singleMC cannot be separately used by two users. Pre-vious MCS s relied on the all-or-nothing principle, a weaker form of unsplittability, where sharing a single coupon implies sharing the whole multi-coupon. The construc-tion proposed in [CEL+ 07] supports coupons with practical attributes: <b>independent</b> <b>benefits,</b> and validity periods (e. g., expiration dates). However, it has the disadvantage that the coupons contained in anMC must be redeemed in sequential order. Hence, it is suitable for fewer applications. In this paper, we address this problem and propose a scheme that satisfies the same set of security requirements, supports the same practical attributes, and offers similar efficiency, but in which users are able to choose which coupon they redeem...|$|R
40|$|Booming {{production}} {{of oil and gas}} from shale enabled by hydraulic fracturing technology has led to tension between hoped-for economic benefits and feared environmental and other costs, with great associated controversy. Studies of how policy can best react to these challenges and how it can balance risk and reward have focused on prescriptive regulatory responses and, to a somewhat lesser extent, voluntary industry best practices. While there is undoubtedly room for improved regulation, innovative tools are relatively understudied. The liability system predates environmental regulation yet still plays an important—and in some senses predominant—role. Changes to that system, including burden-shifting rules and increased bond requirements, might improve outcomes. Similarly, new regulation can and should incorporate modern understanding of the benefits of market-based approaches. Information disclosure requirements can benefit the liability system and have <b>independent</b> <b>benefits</b> of their own. Policymakers faced with a need for policy change in reaction to shale development should carefully consider alternatives to regulation and, when regulation is deemed necessary, consider which tool is best suited...|$|R
