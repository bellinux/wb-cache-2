25|$|In practice, most mathematicians {{either do}} not work from axiomatic systems, or if they <b>do,</b> <b>do</b> not doubt the {{consistency}} of ZFC, generally their preferred axiomatic system. In most of mathematics as it is practiced, the incompleteness and paradoxes of the underlying formal theories never played a role anyway, and in those branches in which they do or whose formalization attempts would {{run the risk of}} forming inconsistent theories (such as logic and category theory), they may be treated carefully.|$|E
25|$|Although {{birds have}} lungs, these are fairly rigid structures, which <b>do</b> <b>do</b> not expand and {{contract}} {{as they do in}} mammals, reptiles and many amphibians. The structures that act as the bellows which ventilate the lungs, are the air sacs distributed throughout much of the birds' bodies. Although the bird lungs are smaller than those in mammals of comparable size, the air sacs account for 15% of the total body volume, compared to the 7% devoted to the alveoli which act as the bellows in mammals.|$|E

6000|$|There {{are many}} {{families}} where the whole interest {{of life is}} centered upon the dog. Cats, by the way, rarely suffer from excess of adulation. A cat possesses a very fair sense of the ridiculous, and will put her paw down kindly but firmly upon any nonsense of this kind. Dogs, however, seem to like it. They encourage their owners in the tomfoolery, and the consequence {{is that in the}} circles I am speaking of what [...] "dear Fido" [...] has <b>done,</b> <b>does</b> <b>do,</b> will <b>do,</b> won't <b>do,</b> can <b>do,</b> can't <b>do,</b> was <b>doing,</b> is <b>doing,</b> is going to <b>do,</b> shall <b>do,</b> shan't <b>do,</b> and is about to be going to have <b>done</b> is the continual theme of discussion from morning till night.|$|R

25|$|Beginning in 2002, a major push {{was made}} to convert the {{building}} into the National Women's History Museum and a bill <b>do</b> <b>do</b> so passed in the United States Senate in 2005. However, local developers, city residents, {{and members of the}} House of Representatives were angry that the building would be given away for free. The bill was reintroduced in the 109th United States Congress, although this time the women's museum asked for only the East Atrium. This effort, too, was unsuccessful, even though the East Atrium had broken floor tiles and unfinished interior construction that exposed beams and left gaping holes instead of storefronts.|$|E

500|$|... "Crazy in Love" [...] was re-recorded by Beyoncé for {{the film}} Fifty Shades of Grey (2015) and used for its trailer which was {{released}} on July 24, 2014. This slowed-down version was produced by Boots with violin arrangements by Margot, both of whom worked on Beyoncé's fifth studio album. Margot said, [...] "It inspires me to work on other artists' songs [...] it pushes my boundaries {{in a direction that}} I wouldn't necessarily come up with. Obviously I know how 'Crazy in Love' goes, but I knew there was the possibility her vocals would be different. It's almost more vulnerable and beautiful this way, because you <b>do</b> <b>do</b> crazy things when you fall in love. To hear the mood reversed and flipped makes it even more powerful." ...|$|E
500|$|The reappearance of Nick Lane and his storyline helped resolve {{an earlier}} plot point from [...] "Over There," [...] {{in which he}} was {{recognized}} by Fringe agent Lincoln Lee before dying. Noble noted that [...] "Worlds Apart' {{and the rest of the}} fourth season brought back a number of characters from the series' [...] "rich history", including Sally, Nick, and David Robert Jones. [...] "This episode," [...] he commented, [...] "is bringing those things back together for us as we face the decision of what to <b>do.</b> <b>Do</b> we keep the worlds together?

And they were like, 'Well we don't want to say that but that's sort of the idea." [...] Thorne said the producers were looking for [...] "a certain type in terms of a strong woman who could keep up with all the men" [...] and that they incorporated elements of Thorne's own personality into the character, such as the strong amount of trust she has in her instincts. Thorne also said she was treated well by the cast, but upon starting, [...] "I was very aware of the fact that it's predominantly men, and I have no problem saying that as a small, dark woman I was terrified. I thought I was going to be put through the ringer." [...] Gerety, when asked about his experience joining the show, said only, [...] "It's interesting. It's really interesting." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{opens with}} Crosetti and Lewis {{looking for clues}} in a dark alley. Levinson and Attanasio {{specifically}} wanted a dialogue-driven prologue scene that did not immediately clarify {{the fact that the}} two men were detectives or what they were looking for. The dialogue and staging of the scene were imitated in the final scene of the last Homicide episode, [...] "Forgive Us Our Trespasses", which aired on May 21, 1999. In that final scene, Detective Rene Sheppard (played by Michael Michele) says to Lewis, [...] "Life is a mystery, just accept it", a line spoken by Crosetti in the first episode. Lewis also said, [...] "That's what's wrong with this job. It ain't got nothin' to <b>do</b> <b>do</b> with life", a line also spoken by Crosetti in the first episode. Early scenes in [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] also involved Giardello introducing rookie detective Bayliss to the homicide unit. Attanasio sought to use Bayliss' orientation as a way of introducing exposition and background about the show to the viewer as well.|$|E

2500|$|In June 1986, {{the trio}} reconvened to play three concerts for the Amnesty International A Conspiracy of Hope Tour. In July of that year, they reunited {{in the studio}} to record a new album. However, Copeland broke his {{collarbone}} in a fall from a horse {{and was unable to}} play the drums. As a result of the tense and short-lived reunion in the studio, [...] "Don't Stand So Close to Me '86" [...] was released in October 1986 as their final single and made it into the UK Top 25; it also appeared on the 1986 compilation , which reached No. 1 in the UK album charts.

2500|$|Pressured {{by their}} record {{company for a}} new record and a prompt return to touring, the Police {{released}} their third album, Zenyatta Mondatta, in October 1980. The album was recorded in a three-week period in the Netherlands for tax reasons. The album gave the group their third UK No. 1 hit, [...] "Don't Stand So Close to Me" [...] (the UK's best selling single of 1980) and another hit single, [...] "De <b>Do</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Do,</b> De Da Da Da", both of which reached No. 10 in the US. While the three band members and co-producer Nigel Gray all expressed immediate regret over the rushed recording for the album, which was finished at 4 AM {{on the day the}} band began their world tour, the album received high praise from critics. The instrumental [...] "Behind My Camel", written by Andy Summers, won the band a Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental Performance, while [...] "Don't Stand So Close to Me" [...] won the Grammy for Best Rock Vocal Performance for Duo or Group.|$|E
