40|$|Aim: {{to study}} {{clinical}} manifestation of neurasthenia in adolescents with school disadaptation {{and to assess}} efficacy of <b>deanol</b> aceglumate in treatment of this disorder. Patients and methods: 64 adolescents aged from 14 to 17 years with neurasthenia were included into the study. Control group consisted of 64 practically healthy adolescents. Diagnostic methods: subjective scale for asthenia assessment (MFI- 20), visual analogue scale for asthenia manifestations assessment (10 -points scale), C. D. Spielberger’s state-trait anxiety test, vegetologic examination with A. M. Vein’s questionnaire, psychophysiological investigation with TOVA (Test of Variables of Attention), quantitative electroencephalography. Results: vegetative dysfunction, decrease of attention level and reaction speed, as well as increased level of reactive anxiety (reliably higher than in control group of healthy participants) was revealed. The results of quantitative electroencephalography demonstrated significant decrease of alpha-rhythm spectrum power in occipital leads in comparison with respective characteristic in the control group. The results of clinical and psychological studies, performed after the treatment course, showed high clinical efficacy of <b>deanol</b> aceglumate in this disorder in adolescents (the improvement was achieved in 44 (68, 8 %) of patients). Conclusions: <b>deanol</b> aceglumate in treatment of asthenic disorders in adolescents with school disadaptation is characterized by high efficacy. Due to absence of its influence on anxiety level, combination of this medicine with nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytics can be suggested to increase {{the efficacy of the}} treatment. </em...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY A {{double-blind}} crossover {{trial with}} 2 -dimethylaminoethanol (<b>Deanol),</b> a possible precursor of brain acetylcholine, {{was carried out}} in nine patients with Huntington's chorea. It was found to be ineffective in inducing any alteration in hyperkinesia. The pharmacological treatment of Huntington's chorea has been based on the use of neuroleptic drugs, on the hypothesis that there is a functional dopaminergic hyperactivity in this illness (Agid, 1975). More recently, after the observation of reduced cholinergic and GABAminergic activity at the striatal level in brains of choreic subjects (McGeer et al., 1973; Stahl and Swanson, 1974; Bird and Iversen, 1974), therapeutic trials were carried out with substances which facilitate the formation and persistence of these supposed neurotransmitters. The hypothesis of reduced cholinergic activity at the striatal level is supported by the therapeutic effectiveness of physostigmine, a powerful anti-cholinesterase drug which also passes the blood-brain barrier (Aquilonius and Sjostrom, 1971; Klawans and Rubovitz, 1972; Davis et al., 1976). Nevertheless, this drug cannot be used clinically because of serious and numerous side effects. Since then, there have been attempts to influence cholinergic metabolism by providing substances considered to be acetylcholine precursors. Dimethylaminoethanol acid (<b>Deanol),</b> a drug which has been proved to enhance the formation of acetylcholine in the CNS, has been shown to have effects on the CNS in animals (Pfeiffer et al., 1957; Haubrich et al., 1975), and in various pathological conditions in humans, such as schizophrenia, periodic headache, chronic states of fatigue, and bronchial asthma (Pfeiffer, 1958; Murphree et al., 1960). With regard to extrapyramidal pathology, dimethylaminoethanol has been used for therapy of Huntington's chorea and tardive dyskinesia. I...|$|E
30|$|Electrochemical {{studies of}} the {{synergistic}} effect of p-phenylenediamine and n,n diphenylthiourea (TPD) as corrosion inhibitor of mild steel in dilute sulphuric and hydrochloric acid through weight loss and potentiodynamic polarization at ambient temperature were performed. Experimental results showed the excellent performance of TPD with an optimal inhibition efficiency of 88.18 and 93.88  % in sulphuric and 87.42 and 87.15  % in hydrochloric acid from both tests at all concentration studied. Polarization studies show the compound to be a mixed-type inhibitor. Adsorption of <b>deanol</b> on the steel surface was observed to obey the Langmuir and Frumkin isotherm models. X-ray diffractometry confirmed the absence of corrosion products and complexes. Optical microscopy confirmed the selective inhibition property of TPD to be through chemical adsorption on the steel surface.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Beyond {{subjective}} assessments, {{the effect}} of skin tensors is difficult to assess. The present 2 -phase randomized double-blind split face {{study was designed to}} compare {{the effect of}} a gel containing 3 % 2 -dimethylaminoethanol (<b>deanol,</b> DMAE) with the same formulation without DMAE. METHODS: In a first pilot study, sensorial assessments and measures of the skin distension under suction were performed in eight volunteers. In a second study conducted in 30 volunteers, shear wave propagation was measured. RESULTS: Large interindividual variations precluded any significant finding in the first study. The DMAE formulation showed, however, a significant effect characterized by increased shear wave velocity in the direction where the mechanical anisotropy of skin showed looseness.

40|$|The authors {{evaluated}} {{the efficacy of}} cholinergic drugs {{in the treatment of}} neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia (TD) by a systematic review of the literature on the following agents: choline, lecithin, physostigmine, tacrine, 7 -methoxyacridine, ipidacrine, galantamine, donepezil, rivastigmine, eptastigmine, metrifonate, arecoline, RS 86, xanomeline, cevimeline, <b>deanol,</b> and meclofenoxate.

40|$|This {{systematic}} review aimed to collate randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of various interventions {{used to treat}} tardive dyskinesia (TD) and, where appropriate, to combine the data for mete-analysis, Clinical trials were identified by electronic searches, handsearches and contact with principal investigators. Data were extracted independently by two reviewers, for outcomes related to improvement, deterioration, side-effects and drop out rates. Data were pooled using the Mantel-Haenzel Odds Ratio (fixed effect model). For treatments that had significant effects, the number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated. From 296 controlled clinical trials, data were extracted from 47 trials. For most interventions, we could identify no RCT-derived evidence of efficacy. A meta-analysis showed that baclofen, <b>deanol</b> and diazepam were no more effective than a placebo. Single RCTs demonstrated a lack of evidence of any effect for bromocriptine, ceruletide, clonidine, estrogen, gamma linolenic acid, hydergine, lecithin, lithium, progabide, seligiline and tetrahydroisoxazolopyridinol. The meta-analysis found that five interventions were effective: L-dopa, oxypertine, sodium valproate, tiapride and vitamin E; neuroleptic reduction was marginally significant. Data from single RCTs revealed that insulin, alpha methyl dopa and reserpine were more effective than a placebo. There was a significantly increased risk of adverse events associated with baclofen, <b>deanol,</b> L-dopa, oxypertine and reserpine. Metaanalysis {{of the impact of}} placebo (n= 485) showed that 37. 3 % of participants showed an improvement. Interpretation of this {{systematic review}} requires caution as the individual trials identified tended to have small sample sizes. For many compounds, data from only one trial were available, and where meta-analyses were possible, these were based on a small number of trials. Despite these concerns, the review facilitated the interpretation of the large and diverse range of treatments used for TD. Clinical recommendations for the treatment of TD are made, based on the availability of RCT-derived evidence, the strength of that evidence and the presence of adverse effects.
