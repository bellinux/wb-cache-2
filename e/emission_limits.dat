To manage risks arising from <b>emissions</b> <b>limits,</b> developing countries should index any <b>emissions</b> <b>limits</b> to variables that predict emissions in the absence of limits.

25|$|The EU has mainly {{acted to}} {{mitigate}} road transport greenhouse emissions mainly through its voluntary agreement on CO2 emissions from cars and subsequently through Regulation 443/2009 which sets mandatory CO2 <b>emission</b> <b>limits</b> for new cars. The EU promoted {{the use of}} biofuels through the directive on {{the promotion of the}} use of biofuels and other renewable fuels for transport (2003/30/EC), also known as Biofuel Directive, which calls for countries across the EU aiming at replacing 5,75% of all transport fossil fuels (petrol and diesel) with biofuels by 2010. None of these regulations, however, were based on carbon intensity of fuel. Fuel quality standards in the European Union are regulated by Directive 98/70/EC.|$|E

Nutrient bioextraction or bioharvesting is {{the practice of}} farming and harvesting shellfish and seaweed {{for the purpose of}} removing nitrogen and other nutrients from natural water bodies. It has been suggested that nitrogen removal by oyster reefs could generate net benefits for sources facing nitrogen emission restrictions, similar to other nutrient trading scenarios. Specifically, if oysters maintain nitrogen levels in estuaries below thresholds that would lead to the imposition of <b>emission</b> <b>limits,</b> oysters effectively save the sources the compliance costs they otherwise would incur. Several studies have shown that oysters and mussels have the capacity to dramatically impact nitrogen levels in estuaries. Additionally, studies have demonstrated seaweed's potential to improve nitrogen levels.|$|E

25|$|The {{classification}} of a laser {{is based on}} the concept of accessible <b>emission</b> <b>limits</b> (AEL) that are defined for each laser class. This is usually a maximum power (in W) or energy (in J) that can be emitted in a specified wavelength range and exposure time that passes through a specified aperture stop at a specified distance. For infrared wavelengths above 4 Î¼m, it is specified as a maximum power density (in W/m2). It {{is the responsibility of the}} manufacturer to provide the correct {{classification of}} a laser, and to equip the laser with appropriate warning labels and safety measures as prescribed by the regulations. Safety measures used with the more powerful lasers include key-controlled operation, warning lights to indicate laser light emission, a beam stop or attenuator, and an electrical contact that the user can connect to an emergency stop or interlock.|$|E
25|$|Obama's {{campaign}} to fight global warming found more {{success at the}} international level than in Congress. Obama attended the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference, which drafted the non-binding Copenhagen Accord as a successor to the Kyoto Protocol. The deal provided for the monitoring of carbon emissions among developing countries, but it did not include Obama's proposal to commit to cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2050. In 2014, Obama reached an agreement with China in which China pledged to reach peak carbon emission levels by 2030, while the US pledged to cut its emissions by 26-28 percent compared to its 2005 levels. The deal provided momentum for a potential multilateral global warming agreement among the world's largest carbon emitters. Many Republicans criticized Obama's climate goals as a potential drain on the economy. At the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, nearly {{every country in the world}} agreed to a landmark climate deal in which each nation committed lowering their greenhouse gas emissions. The Paris Agreement created a universal accounting system for emissions, required each country to monitor its emissions, and required each country to create a plan to reduce its emissions. Several climate negotiators noted that the US-China climate deal and the EPA's <b>emission</b> <b>limits</b> helped make the deal possible. In 2016, the international community agreed to the Kigali accord, an amendment to the Montreal Protocol which sought to reduce the use of HFCs, organic compounds that contribute to global warming.|$|E
500|$|GCC members {{questioned}} {{the efficacy of}} climate change denial and shifted their message to highlighting the economic costs of proposed greenhouse gas emission regulations and the limited effectiveness of proposals exempting developing nations. In 1995, after the United Nations Climate Change conference in Berlin agreed to negotiate greenhouse gas <b>emission</b> <b>limits,</b> GCC's executive director said the agreement gave [...] "developing countries like China, India and Mexico a free ride" [...] and would [...] "change the relations between sovereign countries and the United Nations.

40|$|In this paper, a computable general {{equilibrium}} {{model is}} constructed and is applied to analyse the economic costs of carbon <b>emissions</b> <b>limits</b> on the Taiwanese economy. The counterfactual simulation technique is applied to investigate the economic effects of mitigating carbon emissions via a carbon tax with a compensation policy. Empirical results basing on the Taiwan's data show that both compensation policies, i. e. income tax rate decrease and carbon tax revenues transfer, can reduce the costs of carbon <b>emissions</b> <b>limits</b> and possibly offset welfare reductions due to implementation of a carbon tax. These results also show that, with respect to allocation and distributional effects, the carbon tax revenues transfer {{is better than the}} income tax rate decrease for the selection in compensation policy. From the acceptability of national greenhouse policy, this finding reveals that the economic costs of <b>limiting</b> carbon <b>emissions</b> via a carbon tax can be reduced, if carbon <b>emissions</b> <b>limits</b> are accompanied by redistributing carbon tax revenues. ...|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} alternative <b>emission</b> <b>limit</b> {{values for}} inorganic components {{to be used}} in the revision of the Building Materials Decree (1999) in the Netherlands. Three key factors determine the <b>emission</b> <b>limit</b> value: (1) the environmental compartment under consideration, with its dimensions and the accounted for, (2) the desired level of environmental protection and (3) the scenario applying to the intended use of the construction material. <b>Emission</b> <b>limit</b> values have been derived here from modelled concentrations in soil, groundwater and surface water. The desired level of protection has been elaborated as a stand-still approach (based on quality target values and a risk-based approach (based on PNECs). Two exposure models were used for taking the effects of a time-dependent exposure of the soil to leached components into account, for vertical transport through the soil profile and for retardation of components in the soil profile. The PEARL model was used for binding described by equilibrium adsorption. The ORCHESTRA model was used for binding that also takes speciation into account. For surface water, a dilution factor was computed assuming a certain mixing zone, dependent on the size of the surface water. The consequences of the proposed alternative <b>emission</b> <b>limit</b> values have been estimated on the basis of information in a database containing results of leaching tests for construction materials. The alternatives proposed form the basis for a political decision-making process, where environmental protection will be balanced with other socio-economic concerns...|$|R
40|$|While {{the rest}} of the world has pursued {{absolute}} <b>emissions</b> <b>limits</b> for greenhouse gases, the Bush administration has proposed an alternative policy formulation based, among other things, on reducing emissions intensityâthat is, emissions per dollar of real gross domestic product. Critics of this formulation have denounced the general idea of an intensity-based emissions target, along with its voluntary nature and weak targets. This raises the question of whether intensity-based <b>emissions</b> <b>limits,</b> distinct from the other features of the Bush initiative, offer a useful alternative to absolute <b>emissions</b> <b>limits.</b> This paper makes the case that they do, based on how emissions targets are framed. The argument draws on four key observations: greenhouse gas emissions will continue to rise over the near term, absolute targets emphasize zero or declining emissions growth while intensity targets do not, developing countriesâ economic development is integrally tied to emissions growth for the foreseeable future, and intensity targets need not be any more complicated to administer than absolute targets. carbon, climate, policy, intensity, global warming...|$|R
