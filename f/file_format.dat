In October 1995, Adobe acquired the desktop publishing software company Frame Technology for US$566million, and re-branded its FrameMaker software to Adobe FrameMaker. Adobe acquired GoLive Systems in January 1999 and obtained its CyberStudio HTML editor software, releasing it as Adobe GoLive. In May 2003, Adobe acquired Syntrillium Software and its digital audio editor software Cool Edit Pro, and merged it into its product line, re-releasing it as Adobe Audition.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Digital {{libraries}} {{have been}} built all over the world. Libraries are engaged in creating and maintaining digital libraries. One of the main challenges in maintaining digital libraries is the digital preservation aspect. The aim of digital preservation {{is to ensure that}} digital records are filed and are made available throughout time. There are different digital preservation strategies such as migration, emulation, encapsulation etc. One of the important aspects or key part of any digital preservation activity is the format of the document in which the digital document is created and added in the digital library or repository. Each digital library consists of different documents with different <b>file</b> <b>formats.</b> Due to rapid obsolescence in hardware and software technology it is necessary for the libraries to look into the details of the <b>file</b> <b>formats</b> such as their characteristics, specifications of <b>file</b> <b>formats,</b> categories of <b>file</b> <b>formats,</b> standards used for creating <b>file</b> <b>formats,</b> usability of <b>file</b> <b>formats</b> in long term, etc. Thus <b>file</b> <b>formats</b> {{play an important role in}} any digital preservation. This article tries to discuss about general issues related to <b>file</b> <b>formats,</b> what challenges are there and how format representation information is necessary in any digital preservation aspect, which <b>file</b> <b>formats</b> are preferred formats for long term preservation as well as it will discuss about international initiatives dealing with <b>file</b> <b>formats</b> management registries such as PRONOM & Global Digital Forma...|$|R

5|$|The {{music in}} Final Fantasy Tactics Advance was {{primarily}} composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto, with additional music contributed by Kaori Ohkoshi and Ayako Saso; Nobuo Uematsu provided the main theme. The Final Fantasy Tactics Advance Original Soundtrack album {{was released by}} DigiCube on February 19, 2003. It spans 74 tracks and has a duration of 2:05:27. The first disk includes every song from the game, as it sounds through the Game Boy Advance hardware. The second disk contains fully orchestrated versions of 32 of the same 42 tracks. A new age arrangement album entitled White: Melodies of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, a selection of musical tracks from the game arranged by Yo Yamazaki, Akira Sasaki, and Satoshi Henmi, was released by SME Visual Works on February 26, 2003. White spans 11 tracks and has a duration of 46:10. Within the game, the classical-themed soundtrack is compressed into MIDI <b>file</b> <b>format.</b> Simple sound effects are used during battles, {{and there are no}} voices or speech within the game.|$|E
5|$|In digital puppetry, machinima creators become virtual actors; each {{crew member}} {{controls}} {{a character in}} real-time, as in a multiplayer game. The director can use built-in camera controls, if available. Otherwise, video is captured {{from the perspectives of}} one or more puppeteers who serve as camera operators. Puppetry allows for improvisation and offers controls familiar to gamers, but requires more personnel than the other methods and is less precise than scripted recordings. However, some games, such as the Halo series, (except for Halo PC and Custom Edition, which allow AI and custom objects and characters), allow filming only through puppetry. According to Marino, other disadvantages are the possibility of disruption when filming in an open multi-user environment and the temptation for puppeteers to play the game in earnest, littering the set with blood and dead bodies. However, Chris Burke intentionally hosts This Spartan Life in these unpredictable conditions, which are fundamental to the show. Other works filmed using puppetry are the ILL Clan's improvisational comedy series On the Campaign Trail with Larry & Lenny Lumberjack and Rooster Teeth Productions' Red vs. Blue. In recamming, which builds on puppetry, actions are first recorded to a game engine's demo <b>file</b> <b>format,</b> not directly as video frames. Without re-enacting scenes, artists can then manipulate the demo files to add cameras, tweak timing and lighting, and change the surroundings. This technique is limited to the few engines and software tools that support it.|$|E

40|$|The {{capability}} to validate and view or play binary <b>file</b> <b>formats,</b> {{as well as}} to convert binary <b>file</b> <b>formats</b> to standard or current <b>file</b> <b>formats,</b> is critically important to the preservation of digital data and records. This paper describes the extension of context-free grammars from strings to binary files. Binary files are arrays of data types, such as long and short integers, floating-point numbers and pointers, as well as characters. The concept of an attribute grammar is extended to these context-free array grammars. This attribute grammar has been used to define a number of chunk-based and directory-based binary <b>file</b> <b>formats.</b> A parser generator has been used with some of these grammars to generate syntax checkers (recognizers) for validating binary <b>file</b> <b>formats.</b> Among the potential benefits of an attribute grammar-based approach to specification and parsing of binary <b>file</b> <b>formats</b> is that attribute grammars not only support format validation, but support generation of error messages during validation of format, validation of semantic constraints, attribute value extraction (characterization), generation of viewers or players for <b>file</b> <b>formats,</b> and conversion to current or standard <b>file</b> <b>formats.</b> The significance of these results is that with these extensions to core computer science concepts, traditional parser/compiler technologies can potentially be used {{as a part of a}} general, cost effective curation strategy for binary <b>file</b> <b>formats...</b>|$|R
