5|$|Although Richard sought {{peace with}} France, {{he took a}} {{different}} approach to the situation in Ireland. The English lordships in Ireland were in danger of being overrun, and the Anglo-Irish lords were pleading for the king to intervene. In the autumn of 1394, Richard left for Ireland, where he remained until May 1395. His army of more than 8,000 men was the largest force brought to the island during the late Middle Ages. The invasion was a success, and a number of Irish chieftains submitted to English overlordship. It {{was one of the most}} successful achievements of Richard's reign, and strengthened the king's support at home, although the consolidation of the <b>English</b> <b>position</b> in Ireland proved to be short-lived.|$|E
25|$|The next day, 16 April, {{according}} to the French journal of the siege, 60 French cavalry and 1,200 foot soldiers overwhelmed the unfinished <b>English</b> <b>position</b> at Mount Pelham and spiked four cannons, killing 200 men and taking officers as prisoners. Arthur Grey, the son and biographer of Grey de Wilton, who was commander of a company of demi-lance horsemen, was shot twice, but was not {{in danger of losing}} his life. The French were repulsed and Norfolk reported 150 killed on both sides. Humfrey Barwick blamed Arthur Grey's injury on William Pelham not securing the position properly while the fortlet was under construction.|$|E

The Court regarded the test for apparent bias as [...] "well settled" [...] and, citing its previous judgment in Jeyaretnam, reaffirmed the reasonable suspicion test as the applicable test in Singapore. It found that no matter which test was applied, it made no substantial difference on {{the facts of the}} case.|$|E

2500|$|In Tan Eng Hong, the Court had {{generally}} {{affirmed the}} <b>English</b> <b>position.</b> In cases where a declaration will be [...] "of {{value to the}} parties or to the public", a court may still continue {{to hear the case}} even though [...] "the facts on which the action is based are theoretical". In so holding, the Court seemed to suggest that the first two limbs of the Karaha Bodas test would be concurrently satisfied since [...] "it can be logically said that where there is a real legal interest in a case being heard, there is a real controversy to be determined".|$|E
2500|$|King Stephen of England (fighting rebel barons in the south) {{had sent}} a small force (largely mercenaries), but the English army was mainly local militia and baronial retinues from Yorkshire and the north Midlands. [...] Archbishop Thurstan of York had exerted himself greatly to raise the army, preaching that to {{withstand}} the Scots was to do God's work. [...] The centre of the <b>English</b> <b>position</b> was therefore marked by a mast (mounted upon a cart) bearing a pyx carrying the consecrated host and from which were flown the consecrated banners of the minsters of York, Beverley and Ripon: hence {{the name of the}} battle. This cart-mounted standard was a very northerly example of a type of standard common in contemporary Italy, where it was known as a carroccio.|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, the <b>English</b> <b>position</b> {{pertaining}} to standing {{has become more}} liberal following the issuance in 1977 of Order 53, rule 3(5), of the Rules of the Supreme Court. As {{a result of this}} amendment, an applicant is only required to have [...] "sufficient interest in the matter". This suggests that a wider discretion is conferred on the English courts to grant leave for judicial review applications to be brought since the presence of a public interest element in the matter suffices even though the applicant may not be personally affected. However, although the discretion is wide, it does not entail that judges can treat any interest as [...] "sufficient". In the National Federation case, Lord Wilberforce cautioned that [...] "the court must decide on legal principles". Lord Slynn of Hadley also opined in ex parte Salem that courts must exercise caution when establishing standing. Additionally, appeals which are academic between the parties should not be heard unless there is strong public interest in doing so.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{a poem by}} Thomas Churchyard, a Scotswoman {{initiated}} {{this attack}} by signalling an opportunity to the French. She came with Scottish victuallers to the <b>English</b> <b>position</b> and made her sign from a crag where a cannon had been placed. This story may refer to the existing mounds {{near the site of}} Mount Pelham called the [...] "Giant's Brae" [...] and [...] "Lady Fyfe's Brae". The Leith historian Alexander Campbell, writing in 1827, regarded the mounds as important monuments of the siege, writing that the eastern mound took its name from [...] "Lady Fife's Well", and children called the larger mound by the Grammar School [...] "the Giant's Brae". This was repeated by D.H. Robertson, and the 1852 Ordnance Survey map marked the Giant's Brae as (the remains of) Somerset's Battery with Lady Fyfe's Brae as (the remains of) Pelham's Battery. The local historian Stuart Harris, writing in the 1990s, dismissed the assertion that these mounds were siegeworks rather than natural hillocks, stating that the belief was a [...] "spurious 'tradition'".|$|E
2500|$|Tan Eng Hong {{appeared}} {{to stand for}} the proposition that only {{the first and second}} limbs of the Karaha Bodas test are required, notwithstanding the lack of a violation of a personal right. However, in Vellama the Court of Appeal qualified the proposition and cautioned that Tan Eng Hong must be viewed in its proper context. The applicant in Tan Eng Hong was originally charged under section 377A of the Penal Code, but the charge was dropped and substituted with one for a lesser offence, which he pleaded guilty to. Although this arguably rendered his challenge to the constitutionality of section 377A theoretical, the application was still of [...] "great practical significance" [...] to him. Given the applicant's sexual orientation, so long as the constitutionality of section 377A was not decisively settled, a similar act committed by him could possibly attract prosecution. Therefore, the applicant's personal rights were affected. Thus, there was no contradiction between the adoption of the <b>English</b> <b>position</b> and the third requirement of the Karaha Bodas test in Tan Eng Hong.|$|E

2500|$|Gruffydd's death {{released}} Dafydd {{from the}} threat of rival and within a few weeks the flag of revolt was flown across Wales. Dafydd emerged as the popular leader as he publicly lamented the indignant treatment of his brother, and with Gruffydd's second eldest son Llywelyn beside and supporting his uncle. The lesser Welsh lords again swore fealty to Dafydd as their leige lord, including the Dinefwr lords in Deheubarth. However, the two lords of upper and lower Powys, and Morgan of Gwenllwg, remained aloof to the revolt. The summer of 1244 emerged as one of unrest and strife as Dafydd stirred up his supporters the length and breadth of Wales. Nightly Welsh soldiers raided <b>English</b> <b>positions,</b> Diserth was under siege, and Powys’ province of Cyfeiliog was raided as punishment for Gwenwynwyn's support for the English king. In addition to military strikes on <b>English</b> <b>positions,</b> Dafydd opened a diplomatic offensive against the English crown by appealing directly to Pope Innocent IV, a [...] "bold and original strategy", according to Lloyd. In his plea to the pope, Dafydd offered to hold the Welsh principality as a Papal vassal, noting that Rome had acknowledged his rights as heir. Dafydd's plan had precedents, according to Davies, as [...] "by 1244 about a dozen European rulers have become direct vassals of the Papacy, and the Pope had proved his ability to make and unmake kingdoms." [...] While awaiting the Pope's reply, Dafydd had begun to style himself formally as Prince of Wales, denoting not only the popular monarchy over the Welsh which his earlier forefathers had taken with the title Prince of the Welsh and the title Prince of Aberffraw and Lord of Snowdon, but over a clearly defined territorial principality incorporating the whole of Wales as distinct from England.|$|R
