While a crash occurred in the peloton, a group of 18 ladies pulled away including race leader Chloe Hosking, Ellen van Dijk, Wild, Gracie Elvin, and Trixi Worrack.

Wild powered to third spot ahead of the pack, 5” adrift. With 10 kilometres to go, Brennauer and Blaak could still enjoy a 10” lead. Both were first caught by Fahlin and Cantele and then by the whole golden jersey group with 5 kilometres to go. Just under 40 riders moved closer to the finish line. With under 3 kilometres to go, race leader Hosking suffered a puncture. Despite being eventually given the winner’s time, she could no longer hope for stage victory and extra bonus seconds.

40|$|Abstract — Optimizing {{blocks in}} a System-on-Chip (SoC) circuit is {{becoming}} more and more important nowadays due to the use of third-party Intellectual Properties (IPs) and reused design blocks. In this paper, we propose techniques and methodologies that utilize abundant external don’t-cares that exist in an SoC environment for block optimization. Our symbolic codestatement reachability analysis can extract don’t-care conditions from constrained-random testbenches or other design blocks to identify unreachable conditional blocks in the design code. Those blocks can then be removed before logic synthesis is performed to produce smaller and more power-efficient <b>final</b> <b>circuits.</b> Our results show that we can optimize designs under different constraints and provide additional flexibility for SoC design flows.

2500|$|One of {{the other}} {{recommendations}} in the report was {{the introduction of the}} ring circuit system (often informally called a [...] "ring main"). [...] In this arrangement a cable connected to a fuse, or circuit breaker, in the distribution board was wired in sequence to a number of sockets before being terminated back at the distribution board, thus forming a ring <b>final</b> <b>circuit.</b> In the ring circuit, each socket-outlet was supplied with current by conductors {{on both sides of the}} 'loop.' This contrasts with the radial system (which is also used in the UK, often in the same installation) wherein a single cable runs out radially, like a spoke, from the distribution board to serve a number of sockets. [...] Since the fuse or circuit breaker for a ring circuit has to be rated for the maximum current the ring could carry (30A or 32A for a breaker), additional protection is required at each socket-plug connection. [...] Theoretically, such protection could have been designated either within the socket or within the plug. [...] However, to ensure that this protection has a rating matched to the appliance flexible cord fitted to the plug, a fuse rated between 1A and 13A is incorporated into each plug. Wired connections may also be connected to the ring, and these are also required to include a suitably rated fuse. The ring circuit in the UK requires the use of BS1363 plugs and sockets, but the BS1363 system is not limited to use with ring circuits.|$|E
