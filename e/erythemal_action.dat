25|$|The UV Index is {{a number}} linearly related to the {{intensity}} of sunburn-producing UV radiation at a given point on the earth's surface. It cannot be simply related to the irradiance (measured in W/m2) because the UV of greatest concern occupies a spectrum of wavelength from 295 to 325nm, and shorter wavelengths have already been absorbed a great deal when they arrive at the earth's surface. Skin damage from sunburn, however, is related to wavelength, the shorter wavelengths being much more damaging. The UV power spectrum (expressed as Watts per square metre per nanometre of wavelength) is therefore multiplied by a weighting curve known as the <b>erythemal</b> <b>action</b> spectrum, and the result integrated over the whole spectrum. This gave Canadian scientists a weighted figure (sometimes called Diffey-weighted UV irradiance, or DUV, or erythemal dose rate) typically around 250mW/m2 in midday summer sunlight.

A UPF 30 fabric that blocks 29 out of 30 units of UV is therefore blocking 96.7%. Unlike SPF (Sun Protection Factor) measurements that traditionally use human sunburn testing, UPF is measured using a laboratory instrument (spectrophotometer or spectroradiometer) and an artificial light source, and then applying a sunburn weighting curve (<b>erythemal</b> <b>action</b> spectrum) across the relevant UV wavelengths.

40|$|Many solar UV measurements, either {{terrestrial}} or personal, weight the {{raw data}} by the <b>erythemal</b> <b>action</b> spectrum. However, a problem arises when one tries to estimate the benefit of vitamin D(3) production based on erythemally weighted outdoor doses, like those measured by calibrated R-B meters or polysulphone badges, because the differences between action spectra give dissimilar values. While both action spectra peak in the UVB region, the <b>erythemal</b> <b>action</b> spectrum continues throughout the UVA region while the previtamin D(3) action spectrum stops near that boundary. When one uses the previtamin D(3) action spectrum to weight the solar spectra (D(eff)), one gets a different contribution in W m(- 2) than what the erythemally weighted data predicts (E(eff)).

This study focuses {{on the development of}} a novel solar-blind UV photodetectors in four main areas: (i) Growth of ZnMgS-based II-VI thin films by the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) technique; (ii) study of the structural transition of ZnMgS thin film occurring at a critical thickness during the MBE growth; (iii) photoluminescence (PL) measurements on ZnMgS thin films and (iv) fabrication and characterization of ZnMgS Schottky barrier photodiodes. Various ZnMgS-based II-VI thin films have been successfully grown on GaP substrates by MBE. Ichino et al. [Ref 1] have studied the MBE growth of ZnMgS alloy thin films on GaP (100) substrates up to Mg composition about 0. 45 using excess S beam pressure provided by an elemental S source together with ZnS and Mg source cells. In this work, we used a similar growth scheme to study the structural transition of the ZnMgS alloys covering the entire Mg composition range and revealed that a structural transition will occur at a critical thickness whose value is sensitively dependent on the Mg composition. Room-temperature PL measurements on the as-grown ZnMgS alloy layers were preformed using an excitation wavelength at 275 nm. Their luminescence peaks are quite close to the expected band edge; the origin of these emissions could either result from a band-to-band transition or be of excitionic type. Different excitation peak power density have been used; however, no features of any deep-level emission were detected. The ZnMgS-based Schottky-barrier-type photodetector structures were fabricated using an approach similar to what my supervisior, I. K. Sou, has developed for the ZnSSe structures 2. The bottom electrode consists of a few thousand Å thick n+ - Zn 0. 95 Mg 0. 05 S:Al. An undoped Zn 1 -xMgxS layer as the active layer was grown on top of the bottom electrode layer. A 100 -Å-thick Au layer with area of 3 x 3 mm 2 was deposited on top of the undoped layer using a thermal evaporation technique in a separated vacuum chamber to serve as the top transparent electrode. Room-temperature photoresponse measurements were performed on these detectors and abrupt long-wavelengths cutoffs covering 325, 305, 295 and 270 nm were achieved for devices with Mg composition of 16 %, 44 %, 57 % and 75 %, respectively.

Spectroradiometers, broad-band meters and dosimeters may be used for measurements of solar UV. In addition, radiation transfer models can be used to quantify UV irradiances at various times and locations, provided that the extraterrestrial solar radiation and the state of the atmosphere are known.

The dynamic range of PPO film was found to extend to 2 MJ m- 2 of broadband UV exposure independently of film thickness, providing an exposure range of roughly four summer days at subtropical latitudes. The sensitivity of the film to UV exposure was positively related to film thickness in the 20 - 40 μm range. Films of 40 μm thickness proved to be the most suitable for long-term human UV exposure measurements. The temperature independence of the response of 40 μm PPO film was established from 1. 5 °C to 50 °C within a dosimeter response uncertainty of 6. 5 %. Dose-rate independence was also demonstrated within 8 % of the mean dosimeter response. The spectral response approximates the CIE <b>erythemal</b> <b>action</b> spectrum between 300 and 340 nm, with a peak response at 305 nm. A large deviation from this action spectrum was observed at shorter wavelengths. Investigation of the angular response in both the azimuth and altitude planes showed a cosine error of less than 6. 2 % between 0 ° and 40 °, and did not exceed 13. 3 % at any angle greater than 40 °.

For four different cases, it is shown that Beer's Law {{leads to a}} power law form similar to that applied to <b>erythemal</b> <b>action</b> spectrum weighted irradiances.

In the Southern Hemisphere, zonal and annual average UV increase is partially offset by tropospheric cloud and aerosol transmission decreases (hemispherical dimming), {{and to a lesser}} extent in the Northern Hemisphere. Ozone and 340 nm reflectivity changes have been obtained from multiple joined satellite time series from 1978 to 2008.

For clear-sky conditions at 50 S, zonal average F(sub uv) changes are estimated (305 nm, 23 %; erythemal, 8. 5 %; 310 nm, 10 %; vitamin D production, 12 %). These are larger than at 50 N (305 nm, 9 %; erythemal, 4 %; 310 nm, 4 %; vitamin D production, 6 %). At the latitude of Buenos Aires, Argentina (34. 6 S), the clear-sky Fuv increases are comparable to the increases near Washington, D. C. (38. 9 N) : 305 nm, 9 % and 7 %; erythemal, 6 % and 4 %; and vitamin D production, 7 % and 5 %, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Solar {{ultraviolet}} (UV) radiation {{arriving at}} the Earth’s surface is a biological requirement for most forms of life, but also causes adverse responses in humans, animals and plants in cases of overexposure. Many of the adverse responses are cumulative in nature, and hence solar UV related environmental risk assessment requires quantification of long-term exposures and large UV doses. Dosimetry methods for quantifying solar UV radiation exposure are extremely versatile and cost-effective compared to radiometric methods, and allow time integrated doses to be quantified efficiently. Biodosimetry often provides a large dynamic range, but is expensive, labour intensive and time consuming. Chemical actinometry is a cost and labour effective alternative to biodosimetry, but is disadvantaged for large-dose measurements by its relatively small dynamic range. Poly(dimethyl phenylene oxide) (PPO) film was identified from the literature as a chemical actinometer material {{with the potential to}} reduce the labour and costs involved in the quantification of large solar radiation doses by means of a larger dynamic range. A fabrication technique for PPO film actinometers was established, and the optical properties of the actinometers were fully characterised. The resulting actinometer provides an efficient method for quantifying either unweighted UVB dose or biologically effective dose. The spectral response resembles the <b>erythemal</b> <b>action</b> spectrum, and the solar erythemal calibration function is near linear. The PPO film actinometer is therefore very well suited to human exposure research, especially for evaluation of chronic responses, or cumulative acute responses in which large-dose measurements are required. The PPO film actinometer now provides an additional tool in the quantification of solar UV radiation exposure. It has equal versatility, and similar costs, labour and equipment requirements to the most commonly employed actinometry methods. The larger dynamic range of PPO film however, reduces labour and costs associated with large-dose UV measurements...|$|E
40|$|Abstract]This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} development, testing {{and application of}} a chemical film UV dosimeter based on the polymer Poly (2, 6 -dimethyl- 1, 4 -phenylene oxide) (PPO) prepared especially for long – term high – exposure underwater use. Initial testing of the dosimeter was performed in a water tank within a controlled laboratory environment with an artificial UV source in which various optical and physical properties of the film were rigorously tested such as UV dose and depth response, cosine response, interdosimeter variation, dose rate independence, dark reaction, watermarking effect, exposure additivity and visible and UVA wavelength response. In each of these tests the PPO dosimeter displayed results proving {{that it could be}} reliably used in aquatic environments at a level of accuracy only slightly lower than what could be expected for in – air dosimetric measurements. The use of a polyethylene derived neutral density filter (NDF) was then employed with the PPO dosimeter in order to extend exposure time. Results from this investigation showed that the polyethylene NDF could extend the effective life time of the PPO dosimeter by as much as five days in early autumn. Following this the PPO dosimeter was calibrated in the field to the solar <b>erythemal</b> <b>action</b> spectrum in – air and to the solar UVB spectrum in clear water, creek water, sea water and dam water over the duration of a year. In both the in – air and underwater calibrations {{it was found that the}} response of the PPO dosimeter lasted over a much greater amount of time when compared to the more commonly used polysulphone dosimeter and also varied with the modulation of the incident solar spectrum brought on by changing SZA and fluctuations in atmospheric column ozone. Additionally, it was discovered that in – air and underwater calibration regimes could not be interchanged and that the PPO dosimeter response underwater is dependent upon water type, but only when transmission spectra differed between two water types by a difference on average of more than 5 % across the UVB waveband. As a final test, the PPO dosimeter was deployed over a year to take UVB exposure measurements with the use of a custom built submersible float in three different real – world field environments that included a creek, a sea water tank and a stagnant dam. Exposures could be measured reliably up to a depth of 5 cm in the creek water and the dam water and up to and possibly beyond a depth of 35 cm in the sea water. From the sea water PPO dosimeter measurements a series of attenuation coefficients were estimated for each season. These coefficients showed reasonable agreement when compared to attenuation coefficient calculations made using a calibrated spectrometer in the same sea water, further proving the usefulness of the PPO dosimeter...|$|E
40|$|Ultraviolet (UV) {{radiation}} {{has several}} effects {{on human health}} {{as well as other}} biological and chemical systems. The radiation can be weighted with the <b>erythemal</b> <b>action</b> spectrum and then converted to the dimensionless UV Index, which is designed to indicate the detrimental 'sunburning power' of the radiation for public heath purposes. A global view of the erythemally weighted irradiance from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on board the Aura spacecraft has been available since July, 2004. However, ground-based validation and correction of the satellite data are still required. In this thesis, the erythemal dose rates at local solar noon taken from the satellite were compared to ground-based data measured by spectroradiometers or broadband radiometers in two different climate areas: the Tropics and midlatitudes. This seeks to redress the lack of data and satellite validation for the Tropics, and also allows comparison with previous work in midlatitudes. The validation results show that the satellite data overestimates the ground-based data by 9 %- 32 % at the cleanest site, with a much higher discrepancy at polluted sites. Using a radiative transfer model confirmed that the positive bias in the satellite data was mainly caused by aerosol absorption that is not taken into account in the satellite retrieval algorithm. Therefore, two empirical methods were introduced in order to correct the OMI UV data for absorbing aerosols under clear sky conditions. These methods required aerosol optical depth and aerosol single scattering, or aerosol absorption optical depth, as input parameters. The methods improved the OMI UV data by up to 30 % depending on site and input data source. For cloudy conditions aerosol data is usually not available either from ground-based or satellite-based measurements; however, the effect of cloud is usually far greater than that of aerosol, and some of the aerosol effect (scattering) is intrinsically included in the cloud correction. A further empirical model for cloudy conditions was derived to reduce bias of the OMI UV data with respect to ground-based data. The method only requires the OMI UV data as an input. The cloudy model reduced the bias by about 13 %- 30 % depending on site, and gave similar results even when used with clear sky data. Since ground-based data is sparse, the final goal of the work was to produce a corrected map of UV index for the whole of Thailand, based only on data available from satellite, which gives full regional coverage. Issues with availability and quality of satellite data meant that the best results were achieved by using only the cloudy sky correction, for all conditions. The resulting daily noontime UV Index maps of Thailand were assessed against ground-based data for independent years. The corrected UV Index was within ± 2 compared with ground-based data for all sites, compared to discrepancies of up to 4 UV Index for uncorrected data.
