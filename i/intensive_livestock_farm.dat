40|$|As {{goals are}} set to {{increase}} the share of renewable energy production within the province of Overijssel, the Netherlands, the project group Groen Gas Salland is founded and has taken the initiative to explore the opportunities of green gas production through a biogas infrastructure within the region of Salland. Since within the region of Salland (<b>intensive)</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> is practised, {{it is assumed that}} the utilisation of manure for the production of green gas by means of the anaerobic digestion process has a considerable potential. To comprehend whether the manure can be made available for energy production, it is necessary to learn how manure is currently used and valued by the local farmers within Salland. Due to <b>intensive</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> the manure production exceeds the local demand for manure-based fertilisers, which is considered a problem as this (local) abundance of manure urges for a manure distribution system of which the costs are high. Furthermore, circumstances within the (<b>intensive)</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> sector are changing especially due to the amendment of policies that monitor farming activities. Changes within these institutional rules and especially the perceptions that these changes occur unpredictably, affect the decision making of local farmers and will influence the condition that underlie the manure distribution system. In order to explore the potential for manure-based energy within this complex system, we developed an agent-based model by means of the MAIA framework. Based on our research we found that the energy potential is low due to several related causes. A clear expectation of what will be gained is lacking due to uncertainties about both the amount of subsidy that will be granted and the order of the specific technology costs. Furthermore, since a sufficient production capacity is required, many small-scale to middle-scale farms will not consider manure-based energy production. A considerable investment capital is required as well, this puts a lot of pressure upon the farmers as they often experience at the same time poor financial situations and ongoing changes in the policies. We state that farmers do not obtain a clear benefit concerning the production of manure-based energy as current issues with respect to the abundance of manure are not solved and meanwhile the produced digestate, almost identical in volume and composition to manure, had to find its way back to the manure distribution system. Although cooperation between farmers should not be taken for granted, we found in case farmers do cooperate, the potential for manure-based energy production to be highly increased. In order to increase the potential, we recommend to create a clear benefit from a farmer's point of view, increase their understanding with respect to manure-based energy and reduce institutional barriers, especially with respect to regulations that control subsidy.

The purpose of this legislation is to reach a new balance between various functions in the rural areas. In the current report conclusions are drawn regarding plan development, based on literature and a series of interviews with parties involved in the planning process. The study gives the impression that parties involved subscribe to the plans, there is support. This legislation stipulates differentiation between areas where agriculture can develop, areas where various functions are intertwined and areas for extensifying agricultural activities. The emphasis by law on zoning results in less attention being paid to other possible solutions for problems related tot <b>intensive</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>farming.</b> In the provinces of Noord-Limburg and Noord-Brabant, existing but unused planological rights remain valid in the extensification zones; so there is no change compared to the existing situation as laid down in regional plans. The initial ambitions in the extensification zones were adjusted, after both the central government and the provinces appeared hesitant to pay for damage caused by earlier planning. The designation of pig-free zones free is an obligation by law, however, the informers are sceptical about the benefits. Although stronger co-operation between farmers and their supply and purchase companies could diminish the veterinary vulnerability, no initiatives have been taken to this effect in the plans. The central government will assess the plans according to a detailed framework and decide for financing, after the provinces have drawn up the plans. This will leave little room for interpretation by provinces themselves. Due to developments in relevant environmental laws and re-prioritising policy goals, parties involved had little certainty beforehand.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Population growth, {{increasing}} food demands, {{and economic}} efficiency have been major driving forces behind farming intensification over recent decades. However, biological emissions (bioaerosols) from intensified <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> {{may have the}} potential to impact human health. Bioaerosols from <b>intensive</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> have been reported to cause symptoms and/or illnesses in occupational-settings and there is concern about the potential health effects on people who live near the intensive farms. As well as adverse health effects, some potential beneficial effects have been attributed to farm exposures in early life. The aim {{of the study was to}} undertake a systematic review to evaluate potential for adverse health outcomes in populations living near <b>intensive</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>farms.</b> MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two electronic databases (PubMed and Scopus) and bibliographies were searched for studies reporting associations between health outcomes and bioaerosol emissions related to intensive farming published between January 1960 and April 2017, including both occupational and community studies. Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. Risk of bias was assessed using a customized score. RESULTS: 38 health studies met the inclusion criteria (21 occupational and 1 community study measured bioaerosol concentrations, 16 community studies using a proxy measure for exposure). The majority of occupational studies found a negative impact on respiratory health outcomes and increases in inflammatory biomarkers among farm workers exposed to bioaerosols. Studies investigating the health of communities living near intensive farms had mixed findings. All four studies of asthma in children found increased reported asthma prevalence among children living or attending schools near an intensive farm. Papers principally investigated respiratory and immune system outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The review indicated a potential impact of intensive farming on childhood respiratory health, based on a small number of studies using self-reported outcomes, but supported by findings from occupational studies. Further research is needed to measure and monitor exposure in community settings and relate this to objectively measured health outcomes...|$|R

Because the concept of societal valuation also raises many questions, this parallel study was added in order to create space for reflection on societal valuation. The character of this reflection has been informed by widespread signals of ambivalence towards meat as well as the suspicion that because of that ambivalence people often do not want to know too many details about meat and <b>livestock</b> <b>farming.</b> This can complicate research into societal valuation. The leading ques-tion of this study is whether and how insights into ambivalence and strategic ignorance can be helpful for understanding societal valuation, in particular with respect to meat. Some questions on this topic have al-so been added to the agri-foodmonitor itself. Ambivalence (conflicting valuation) with respect to meat has increased in recent decades because on the one hand most people are attached to eating meat while on the other hand, a great deal of unsettling information on <b>intensive</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> is in the air. Ambivalence leads to emotional agitation, especially when choices relating to cherished habits are involved.

This finding indicates that these characteristics are useful in modelling approaches for redesigning farming systems. In addition, both maps closely linked herd operations to the forage system in a cluster centered on the feeding–health–production complex. This result suggests that the feeding–health–production complex requires particular attention for organic conversion of dairy farms. Lastly, novel relations were identified in the maps that linked work organisation and farm configuration to reproductive performance. This finding shows that analysing work organisation helps understanding how biotechnical performance evolves in a farming system...|$|R
40|$|ISSN: 1773 - 0155 (electronic version) <b>Intensive</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> has {{recently}} induced several cases threatening food security. Therefore, redesigning sustainable <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> systems {{is a major}} challenge for agricultural science. Specifically, farm-scale models that truly integrate different subsystems, viewpoints and time scales are needed. Up to now, however, no modelling approach {{has been able to}} meet these requirements. In previous work, we have designed a participatory modelling method based on causal mapping to help farmer groups redesign their <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> systems. Two causal maps have been built with two neighbouring groups of dairy farmers converting and converted to organic farming. It {{was the first time that}} consistent wholes had been made of elements cited by farmers faced with a redesign process.

30|$|One pathway from soil {{to water}} is through {{preferential}} flow channels and drainage pipes (also called “tile drains” or “mole drains”). For the monitoring of this pathway, the sampling procedure {{seems to be}} crucial. Based on grab samples taken in creeks and from “tile drains” on four different dates, [19] found no enhanced estrogen concentrations in surface water collected upstream and downstream of a large confinement dairy operation in the mid-western United States. In contrast to that, a Danish one-year study on two field sites with “structured, loamy soil” [13] found E 1 and E 2 in the drainage pipes within 14 – 30 days after application of pig manure slurry as well as continued leaching in high concentrations after 3  months. They sampled drainage water flow-proportionally for approximately 1  day, following the onset of “typical” storm events. Matthiessen et al. [20] used “POCIS” passive samplers to monitor 10 streams in England and Wales, from November 2005 to January 2006. Their study sites lay upstream and downstream of <b>intensive</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>farms</b> and were chosen due to a high predicted steroid load. estrogenic activities were higher in 50  % and steroid concentrations were higher in 60  % of the downstream sites. However, estrogenic activity could not solely be attributed to E 1 and E 2.|$|R
40|$|In areas under <b>intensive</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> {{and with}} high {{application}} rates of animal manure, inorganic and organic phosphorus (P) may be leached from soils. Since {{the contribution of}} these P compounds to P leaching may differ, {{it is important to}} determine the speciation of P in these soils. We determined the effect of various fertilization regimes on the P speciation in NaOH–Na 2 EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) and water extracts of acidic sandy soil samples from the top 5 cm of grassland with wet chemical analysis and 31 P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. These soils had been treated for a period of 11 years with no fertilizer (control), N (no P application), N–P–K, or different animal manures. Inorganic P was highly elevated in the NaOH–Na 2 EDTA extracts of the soils amended with N–P–K or animal manures, while organic P increased only in the soil treated with pig slurry. Water-extractable P showed a similar trend. As indicated by 31 P NMR, orthophosphate monoesters were the main organic P compounds in all soils. Our results suggest that long-term applications of large amounts of P fertilizer and animal manures caused an accumulation of inorganic P, resulting in an increase of the potential risk related to mobilization of inorganic P in the top 5 cm of these soils...|$|R
