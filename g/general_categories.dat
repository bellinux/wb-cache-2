5|$|Management of {{low back}} pain depends on which of the three <b>general</b> <b>categories</b> is the cause: {{mechanical}} problems, non-mechanical problems, or referred pain. For acute pain that is causing only mild to moderate problems, the goals are to restore normal function, return the individual to work, and minimize pain. The condition is normally not serious, resolves without much being done, and recovery is helped by attempting to return to normal activities {{as soon as possible}} within the limits of pain. Providing individuals with coping skills through reassurance of these facts is useful in speeding recovery. For those with sub-chronic or chronic {{low back pain}}, multidisciplinary treatment programs may help. Initial management with non–medication based treatments is recommended, with NSAIDs used if these are not sufficiently effective.|$|E

When in inference mode, a node in each level interprets information coming in from its child nodes in the lower level as probabilities of the categories it has in memory.|$|E
