5000|$|The Soviet Armed Forces used {{several types}} of body armor, {{including}} the SN-42 ("Stalnoi Nagrudnik" [...] is Russian for [...] "steel breastplate", and the number denotes the <b>design</b> <b>year).</b> All were tested, but only the SN-42 was put in production. It consisted of two pressed steel plates that protected the front torso and groin. The plates were 2 mm thick and weighed 3.5 kg (7.7 lb). This armor was generally supplied to SHISBr (assault engineers) and Tankodesantniki. The SN armor protected wearers from 9×19mm bullets fired by an MP 40 at around 100 meters, and sometimes {{it was able to}} deflect 7.92 Mauser bullets (and bayonet blades), but only at very low angle. Which made it useful in urban battles such as the Battle of Stalingrad. However, the SN's weight made it impractical for infantry in the open.|$|E
