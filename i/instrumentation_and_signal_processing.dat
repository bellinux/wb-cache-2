5000|$|However in some {{electronic}} circuits such as radio receivers, telecommunications, sensors, <b>instrumentation</b> <b>and</b> <b>signal</b> <b>processing</b> circuits, the AC signals are [...] "small" [...] {{compared to the}} DC voltages and currents in the circuit. In these, perturbation theory {{can be used to}} derive an approximate AC equivalent circuit which is linear, allowing the AC behavior of the circuit to be calculated easily. In these circuits a steady DC current or voltage from the power supply, called a bias, is applied to each nonlinear component such as a transistor and vacuum tube to set its operating point, and the time-varying AC current or voltage which represents the signal to be processed is added to it. The point on the graph representing the bias current and voltage is called the quiescent point (Q point). In the above circuits the AC signal is small compared to the bias, representing a small perturbation of the DC voltage or current in the circuit about the Q point. If the characteristic curve of the device is sufficiently flat over the region occupied by the signal, using a Taylor series expansion the nonlinear function can be approximated near the bias point by its first order partial derivative. These partial derivatives represent the incremental capacitance, resistance inductance and gain seen by the signal, and can be used to create a linear equivalent circuit giving the response of the real circuit to a small AC signal. This is called the [...] "small-signal model".|$|E

Radionuclide measurement techniques are needed to monitor surface waters, groundwater, and process waters. Typically, water samples are collected and transported to the analytical laboratory where costly radiochemical analyses are performed. To date, there has been very little development of selective radionuclide sensors for alpha- and beta-emitting radionuclides such as {sup 90 }Sr, {sup 99 }Tc, and various actinides of interest. The objective of this project is to investigate novel sensor concepts and materials for sensitive and selective determination of beta- and alpha-emitting radionuclide contaminants in water. To meet the requirements for low-level, isotope-specific detection, the proposed sensors are based on radiometric detection. As a means to address the fundamental challenge of short ranges of beta and alpha particles in water, our overall approach is based on localization of preconcentration/separation chemistries directly on or within the active area of a radioactivity detector using automated microfluidics for sample manipulation and sensor regeneration or renewal. The outcome of these investigations will be the knowledge necessary to choose appropriate chemistries for selective preconcentration of radionuclides from environmental samples, new materials that combine chemical selectivity with scintillating properties, new materials that add chemical selectivity to solid-state diode detectors, new preconcentrating column sensors, and improved <b>instrumentation</b> <b>and</b> <b>signal</b> <b>processing</b> for selective radionuclide sensors.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to benchmark the different signal enhancements found in a recently exploited fluorescence ratiometric optode design used for nano-molar imaging of ammonium and ammonia. The sensing scheme of these optodes are based on a mediated transfer of the analyte together with a fluorescent dye in a two-phase system consisting of a gold nanoparticle (GNP) doped ether (organic phase), emulsified in a hydrogel (hydrous phase). The coextraction of the ion dye pair causes changes in fluorescence in relation to the analyte concentration. Performances of optodes with and without GNPs using the gradually improved <b>instrumentation</b> <b>and</b> <b>signal</b> <b>processing</b> were evaluated and normalized to be comparable. Signal to noise w as enhanced due to signal processing based on ensemble averaging (1. 7 × - 3. 2 ×), CCD sensitivity (2 ×), and plasmon assisted fluorescence (10 × - 100 ×), which altogether with the ratiometric treatment of the fluorescence contributed to the great sensitivity for ammonium and ammonia. The study shows that GNP doped sensors are relatively more sensitive to matrix effects but if they are isolated by a protective layer they will dramatically increase in sensitivity. Proper isolation of the active chemical components from the matrix will make the sensor design one of the most powerful and versatile concepts for chemical imaging and single point detection in complex environments as the optodes likely can be constructed for most ions that have selective ionophores. </p...|$|E

New developments in low frequency radio <b>instrumentation</b> <b>and</b> <b>signal</b> <b>processing</b> allow very sensitive EOR measurements, and the analysis techniques enabled by these advances offer natural ways of separating the EOR signal from the residual foreground emission. This paper introduces the enabling technologies and proposes an analysis technique designed to make optimal use of the capabilities of next generation low frequency radio arrays. The observations we propose can directly observe the power spectrum of the EOR using relatively short observations, and are significantly more sensitive than other techniques which have been discussed in the literature. For example, {{in the absence of}} foreground contamination the measurements we propose would produce five 3 -sigma power spectrum points in 100 hours of observation with only 4 MHz bandwidth with LOFAR for simple models of the high redshift 21 cm emission. The challenge of residual foreground removal may be addressed by the symmetries in the three-dimensional (two spatial frequencies and radiofrequency) radio interferometric data. These symmetries naturally separate the EOR signal from most classes of residual un-subtracted foreground contamination, including all foreground continuum sources and radio line emission from the Milky Way.

The overall technical approach is based on automated radiochemical measurement principles, which entails integration of sample treatment and separation chemistries and radiometric detection within a single functional analytical instrument. Nuclear waste process streams are particularly challenging for rapid analytical methods due to the complex, high-ionic-strength, caustic brine sample matrix, the presence of interfering radionuclides, and the variable and uncertain speciation of the radionuclides of interest. As a result, matrix modification, speciation control, and separation chemistries are required for use in automated process analyzers. Significant knowledge gaps exist relative {{to the design of}} chemistries for such analyzers so that radionuclides can be quantitatively and rapidly separated and analyzed in solutions derived from low-activity waste processing operations. This research is addressing these knowledge gaps in the area of separation science, nuclear detection, and analytical chemistry and instrumentation.

In addition, the cost of false positives constitutes wasted time and emotional anxiety for both patient and GP. Many heart diseases cause changes in heart sound, waveform, and additional murmurs before other signs and symptoms appear. Heart-sound auscultation is the primary test conducted by GPs. These sounds are generated primarily by turbulent flow {{of blood in the}} heart. Analysis of heart sounds requires a quiet environment with minimum ambient noise. In order to address such issues, the technique of denoising and estimating the biomedical heart signal is proposed in this investigation. Normally, the performance of the filter naturally depends on prior information related to the statistical properties of the signal and the background noise. This paper proposes Kalman filtering for denoising statistical heart sound. The cycles of heart sounds are certain to follow first-order Gauss&ndash;Markov process. These cycles are observed with additional noise for the given measurement. The model is formulated into state-space form to enable use of a Kalman filter to estimate the clean cycles of heart sounds. The estimates obtained by Kalman filtering are optimal in mean squared sense. Keywords: heart sound, murmurs, ECG, Kalman filters, acoustic cardiac signal...|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{manufacturers}} with many different families of PLD devices, {{so there are}} many variations in architecture. The two major types of programmable logic devices are field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs). The {{distinction between the two}} is often a little fuzzy, with manufacturers designing new, improved architectures, and frequently muddying the waters for marketing purposes. Together, CPLDs and FPGAs are often referred to as High-Capacity Programmable Logic Devices (HCPLDs). Simple Programmable Logic Devices (SPLD) informationThe programming technologies for PLD devices are actually based on the various types of semiconductor memory. As new types of memories have been developed, the same technology has been applied to the creation of new types of PLD devices. The amount of logic resources available is the major distinguishing feature between SPLDs and HCPLDs. Today, SPLDs are devices that typically contain the equivalent of 600 or fewer gates, while HCPLDs have thousands {{and hundreds of thousands of}} gates available. Of the two types of HCPLD devices, FPGAs offer the highest amount of logic density, the most features, and the highest performance. FPGAs are used in a wide variety of applications ranging from data processing <b>and</b> storage, to <b>instrumentation,</b> telecommunications, <b>and</b> digital <b>signal</b> <b>processing.</b> CPLDs, by contrast, offer much smaller amounts of logic - up to about 10,000 gates. But CPLDs offer very predictable timing characteristics and are therefore ideal for critical control applications. Some CPLDs require extremely low amounts of power and are very inexpensive, making them ideal for cost-sensitive, battery-operated, portable applications such as mobile phones and digital handheld assistants.|$|R
40|$|This Volume {{documents}} the Phase 111 {{effort on the}} Seismic Detection and Location of Isolated Miners on Contract H 0122026 undertaken during the fall of 1972 by a task team composed of ADL staff and several seismic consultants. The team was assembled specifically {{to work together on}} complementary tasks, at an accelerated level of effort for four months, to meet the Bureau of Mines' time schedule for obtaining independent, objective, technical judgments regarding seismic methods and systems for detecting and locating isolated miners. The impetus for this work resulted from a compilation and analysis, {{during the first half of}} 1972, of new experimental data obtained from a series of in-mine field tests conducted by Westinghouse Corp. + using the CMRSS* interim seismic location system. The Bureau of Mines took advantage of the availability of these new data to reassess the potential and limitations of various seismic methods and systems, and to direct its seismic system improvement program accordingly. ADL assisted the Bureau in this reassessment by drawing on the skills of seismic consultants from industry, universities and government, to supplement the skills of the ADL project team. The consultants were principal resources of broadly-based and detailed technical expertise in the areas of seismic signal-source and signal-propagation characteristics, natural and cultural seismic noise, seismic sensors <b>and</b> field <b>instrumentation,</b> seismic <b>signal</b> <b>and</b> data <b>processing</b> for detection and location, and overall seismic system utilization in the field under operational emergency conditions. Specifically, the participating consultants were: F. Crowley, Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories; W. Dean, Teledyne Geotech, Alexandria Laboratories; R. Greenfield, Pennsylvania State University; J. Kuo, Columbia University; D. Peters and R. Crosson, University of Washington; and F. Pilotte, U. S. VELA Seismological Center. The principal ADL participants were J. Ginty, R. Lagace, M. Roetter, and R. Spencer...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} retrieving the temperature profile of the Earth's atmosphere from overhead infrared and microwave observations of spectral radiance in cloudy conditions. The contributions of the thesis are twofold: improvements in 1) microwave <b>instrumentation</b> <b>and</b> 2) hyperspectral <b>signal</b> <b>processing</b> <b>and</b> estimation algorithms. The NPOESS Aircraft Sounder Testbed-Microwave (NAST-M) passive spectrometer was designed, fabricated and deployed. NAST-M provides accurate brightness temperature measurements in 16 channels near the oxygen absorption lines at 50 - 57 GHz and 118. 75 GHz, permitting the first reliably accurate retrieval images of temperature profiles and precipitation structure in cloudy areas. The correlation structure of the NPOESS Aircraft Sounder Testbed-Infrared (NAST-I) instrument noise was analyzed in the spectral and spatial domains using the Iterated Order-Noise (ION) algorithm [1] for two representative flights. Results indicate that vibration-induced noise was the dominant component, but {{that it could be}} significantly reduced by filtering in the spatial domain. Novel multi-pixel cloud clearing and temperature profile retrieval algorithms were developed for simulated Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) radiances using neural networks. RMS temperature profile retrieval errors of - 0. 5 K were obtained for all levels of the atmosphere from 0 - 15 km in clear air at a horizontal resolution of 2000 km 2 and a vertical resolution of 1 km. RMS radiance errors under cloudy conditions for altitudes from 0 to 10 kilometers ranged from 1. 25 K to 0. 1 K for radiance retrievals near 15 microns, and from 0. 8 K to 0. 05 K for radiance retrievals near 4 microns. (cont.) Validation of the simulation results with NAST observations was hampered by the lack of a statistically-diverse data set accompanied by cloud truth. An upper bound on cloud-clearing performance (NEAT) was estimated to be approximately a factor of two worse than the simulation results accompanied by ground truth. An improvement of approximately 25 percent in RMS radiance cloud-clearing performance was realized by rejecting 20 percent of soundings based on a neural network-derived metric. by William Joseph Blackwell.
