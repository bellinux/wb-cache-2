25|$|A clausula or clausula vera ("true close") is a dyadic or intervallic, {{rather than}} chordal or harmonic, cadence.

In three voices the third voice often adds a falling fifth creating a cadence {{similar to the}} authentic cadence in tonal music.|$|E

25|$|In a melodic semitone, {{listeners}} of {{the time}} perceived no tendency of the lower tone toward the upper, or the upper toward the lower. The second tone was not the 'goal' of the first. Instead, musicians avoided the semitone in clausulas because, to their ears, it lacked clarity as an interval. Beginning in the 13th century cadences begin to require motion in one voice by semitone {{and the other a}} tone <b>in</b> <b>contrary</b> motion. In the 14th century, an ornamentation of this, with an escape tone, became known as the Landini cadence, after the composer, who used them prodigiously.|$|E

25|$|According to the Ahmadiyya {{understanding}} of Islam, pacifism {{is a strong}} current, and jihad is one's personal inner struggle {{and should not be}} used violently for political motives. Violence is the last option only to be used to protect religion and one's own life in extreme situations of persecution. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, the founder of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, said that <b>in</b> <b>contrary</b> to the current views, Islam does not allow the use of sword in religion, except in the case of defensive wars, wars waged to punish a tyrant, or those meant to uphold freedom.|$|E
25|$|However, {{beginning}} in the 13th century cadences begin to require motion in one voice by half step {{and the other a}} whole step <b>in</b> <b>contrary</b> motion. These cadences would become a fundamental part of the musical language, even {{to the point where the}} usual accidental accompanying the minor second in a cadence was often omitted from the written score (a practice known as musica ficta). By the 16th century, the semitone had become a more versatile interval, sometimes even appearing as an augmented unison in very chromatic passages. Semantically, in the 16th century the repeated melodic semitone became associated with weeping, see: passus duriusculus, lament bass, and pianto.|$|E

This unawareness are added with wind flow, waves and turbulence that push the boat in sea. While UN law advocates for minimum penalty for this offence and release of boats, but government of India and Pakistan catch these prisoners and keep them in prisons for long time. It is more unfortunate that their release happens through land boundary of India and Pakistan (Wagha border) and these poor fishermen come to their home country without their boats.|$|E

25|$|Henry Chadwick, an English {{statistician}} {{raised on}} cricket, was an influential {{figure in the}} early history of baseball. In the late 19th century he adapted the concept behind the cricket batting average to devise a similar statistic for baseball. Rather than simply copy cricket's formulation of runs scored divided by outs, he realized that hits divided by at bats would provide a better measure of individual batting ability. This is because while in cricket, scoring runs is almost entirely dependent on one's own batting skill, in baseball it is largely dependent on having other good hitters on one's team. Chadwick noted that hits are independent of teammates' skills, so used this {{as the basis for the}} baseball batting average. His reason for using at bats rather than outs is less obvious, but it leads to the intuitive idea of the batting average being a percentage reflecting how often a batter gets on base, whereas <b>in</b> <b>contrary,</b> hits divided by outs is not as simple to interpret in real terms.|$|E
25|$|Guaguancó is {{a couple}} dance of sexual {{competition}} between the male and female. The male periodically attempts to “catch” his partner with a single thrust of his pelvis. This erotic movement is called the vacunao (‘vaccination’ or more specifically ‘injection’), a gesture derived from yuka and makuta, symbolizing sexual penetration. The vacunao can also be expressed with a sudden gesture made by the hand or foot. The quinto often accents the vacunao, usually as the resolution to a phrase spanning more than one cycle of clave. Holding onto the ends of her skirt while seductively moving her upper and lower body <b>in</b> <b>contrary</b> motion, the female “opens” and “closes” her skirt in rhythmic cadence with the music. The male attempts to distract the female with fancy (often counter-metric) steps, accented by the quinto, until he is in position to “inject” her. The female reacts by quickly turning away, bringing the ends of her skirts together, or covering her groin area with her hand (botao), symbolically blocking the “injection.” Most {{of the time the}} male dancer does not succeed in “catching” his partner. The dance is performed with good-natured humor.|$|E
25|$|In part writing, {{the usage}} of Conjunct Melodic Motion is important, in which the parts {{generally}} move in stepwise motion, and in counterpoint, {{if there is a}} leap (a jump of a fourth or above), the part will progress the opposite direction it just leapt in stepwise motion. Parts also must progress together <b>in</b> <b>contrary</b> motion, meaning the parts are going in different directions. This is preferable to parallel motion, where the parts move together, or oblique motion, where one part doesn’t move and another does. Parallel motion can be used, {{but it is important to}} pay attention to intervals in order to avoid breaking counterpoint rules. Dissonant intervals, both melodic and harmonic intervals are not preferable in most cases. This includes augmented or diminished intervals, tritones, and seventh chords, simply because they sound very jarring in a piece that is meant to sound pleasant to the ear. Parallel intervals, which occur when two parts move the same distance creating the same interval twice in a row, are also important to be aware of. However, this is only a problem when the intervals are either a perfect fifth or a perfect octave. These also can sound uncomfortable to the ear as they tend to have an open or hollow sound.|$|E

500|$|The {{left hand}} follows the {{standard}} approach of classical waltzes, with a bass note {{followed by two}} mid-range chords, and in addition there are some contrapuntal passages where two melodies move independently but complement each other harmonically. For example, the B and C themes are examples of Joplin employing counterpoint in octaves. The B theme in the key of B-flat major {{is closely related to}} the main theme presenting its counterpoint with the bass and the treble melody lines moving in opposite directions (<b>in</b> <b>contrary</b> motion), to each other and then exchanging their melodies (bars 29-30 and 31-32). This pattern repeats itself during the theme. In the opening phrase (bars 77-81) of the [...] "rag-like" [...] C theme in the key of F major, counterpoint is evident with the harmony of the treble moving <b>in</b> <b>contrary</b> motion to the bass line in a similar way to that used in the B section.

500|$|The {{following}} bass aria, [...] "" [...] (Let {{my heart}} be the coin), has an unusual and unique accompaniment of two obbligato cellos with continuo.

[...] Bach was interested in coins and precious metals. The conductor Craig Smith compares the dark texture to the [...] "descent into the earth in Wagner's Das Rheingold".

500|$|Of the new designs, turumas and hemmemas {{best fit}} the {{description}} of [...] "archipelago frigate" [...] because of their similarities to small ocean-going frigates. The first hemmema, the Oden, was completed in 1764. It was c. 33m (108.2ft) long and 8.2m (26.8ft) wide with a draft of 2.8m (9.25ft). It had a low hull with no forecastle, only a low quarterdeck, and no poop deck. It had three masts that were initially rigged with lateen sails, like a galley. The navy later replaced the lateen rigs with a more conventional square-sail frigate rig. The early design provided for 14 pairs of oars with four men per oar. The rowers plied their oars from the gun deck through oar ports positioned between the gunports, close to the waterline, which gave the rowers better leverage. The oars were also placed on a rectangular outrigger, designed to further improve the leverage. Even so, hemmemas performed poorly when rowed and were difficult <b>in</b> <b>contrary</b> winds. They were slower than ordinary sailing ships, but sailed better than galleys.|$|E
500|$|R.A., {{writing on}} The Economists Free Exchange blog, {{concluded}} that Cowen's analysis of education {{suggested that the}} rich world would do better by aiding mass education programs in developing countries rather than pursuing the diminishing returns in domestic education and research, <b>in</b> <b>contrary</b> [...] to President Obama's State of the Union speech in 2011.

In The Economist, two different sets of policy responses were considered {{depending on whether the}} true cause is ailing technological innovation or a decline in workers' bargaining power in the face of emerging-market industrialization. Progressive taxation and redistribution would offset labor's position of weakness whilst a limited state would reduce commitments it cannot expect to fulfill in a stagnating economy.|$|E
500|$|The film's {{tone and}} {{narrative}} style received mixed {{response from the}} critics. Ronnie Scheib at Variety {{found it to be}} filled with excessive pathos, [...] "shuttling between the trite and the sublime", while Odile Tremblay (Le Monde) said <b>in</b> <b>contrary</b> that the film avoided excessive pathos, rendering it funny and tragic at the same time, an observation that was supported by Jacques Mandelbaum at Le Devoir, who wrote that the film mixes humour, sensitivity and drama. Hammer to Nails review by Michael Nordine asserted that the film is [...] "neither a pity party nor an emotionally manipulative attempt", but a straightforward portrayal of things as they were, citing Gatlif's portrayal of the Romani as [...] "certainly sympathetic, but at no point does it seem overly so." [...] The film provided insufficient analysis on the [...] "anti-roaming laws" [...] and their targeting of the Romani, observed [...] the reviewer, to whom the Nazi and all other anti-Romani characters in the film came across as [...] "one dimensional bigots". Bob Hill (Moving Pictures Network) criticised that the film failed to strike an emotional chord, unlike other movies and books with a similar theme. He conceded it to be an [...] "important, but not a great movie—or even a particularly good one, for that matter." [...] For a casual movie goer, he stated, [...] "Korkoro feels like a slow burn, lagging on long after most of the audience has long since called it quits". In defence of the film's incoherent narrative style, Jr Glenn Heath at Slant Magazine explained that Gatlif intended it less as a historical drama and more as evoking the sense of a memory, imbibing the stream of consciousness techniques. Commenting on its tone, he wrote that [...] "Korkoro is a reserved but lasting examination of collectively silent horror". At L'Express, Sophie Benamon declared that with the film's controlled pace, it keeps its viewers breathless and induces emotion. Alexis Campion at Le Journal du Dimanche stated that the film transcends the stereotypes while the reviewer at Arizona Reporter noted that some might consider it to be stereotyping the Romani.|$|E
