40|$|The manner {{by which}} effects of {{simultaneous}} mutations combine to change enzymatic activity {{is not easily}} predictable because these effects are not always additive in a linear manner. Hence, the characterization {{of the effects of}} simultaneous mutations of amino acid residues that bind the substrate can make a significant contribution {{to the understanding of the}} substrate specificity of enzymes. In the &# 946;-glycosidase from Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf&# 946;gly), both residues Q 39 and <b>E</b> <b>451</b> interact with the substrate and this is essential for defining substrate specificity. Double mutants of Sf&# 946;gly (A <b>451</b> <b>E</b> 39, S <b>451</b> <b>E</b> 39 and S 451 N 39) were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis, expressed in bacteria and purified using affinity chromatography. These enzymes were characterized using p-nitrophenyl &# 946;-galactoside and p-nitrophenyl &# 946;-fucoside as substrates. The k cat/Km ratio for single and double mutants of Sf&# 946;gly containing site-directed mutations at positions Q 39 and <b>E</b> <b>451</b> was used to demonstrate that the effect on the free energy of ES&# 8225; (enzyme-transition state complex) of the double mutations (&# 8710;&# 8710;G&# 8225;xy) is not the sum of the effects resulting from the single mutations (&# 8710;&# 8710;G&# 8225;x and &# 8710;&# 8710;G&# 8225;y). This difference in &# 8710;&# 8710;G&# 8225; indicates that the effects of the single mutations partially overlap. Hence, this common effect counts only once in &# 8710;&# 8710;G&# 8225;xy. Crystallographic data on &# 946;-glycosidases reveal the presence of a bidentate hydrogen bond involving residues Q 39 and <b>E</b> <b>451</b> and the same hydroxyl group of the substrate. Therefore, both thermodynamic and crystallographic data suggest that residues Q 39 and <b>E</b> <b>451</b> exert a mutual influence on their respective interactions with the substrate.

40|$|The {{fluorescence}} of a fluorophore {{depends on}} its environment, and if attached to a protein it may report on conformational changes. We have combined two-electrode voltage clamp with simultaneous fluorescence measurements to detect conformational changes in a type IIb Na(+) /P(i) cotransporter expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Four novel Cys labelled with a fluorescent probe yielded voltage-and substrate-dependent changes in fluorescence (F). Neither Cys-substitution nor labelling significantly altered the mutants' electrogenic properties. Different F responses to voltage and substrate were recorded at the four sites. S 155 C, located in an intracellular re-entrant loop {{in the first half}} of the protein, and <b>E</b> <b>451</b> C, located in an extracellular re-entrant loop in the second half of the protein both showed Na(+), Li(+) - and P(i) -dependent F signals. S 226 C and Q 319 C, located at opposite ends of a large extracellular loop in the middle of the protein, mainly responded to changes in Na(+) and Li(+). Hyperpolarization increased F for S 155 C and S 226 C, but decreased F for Q 319 C and <b>E</b> <b>451</b> C. The labelling and F response of S 155 C, confirmed that the intracellular loop containing Ser- 155 is re-entrant as it is accessible from the extracellular milieu. The behavior of S 155 C and <b>E</b> <b>451</b> C indicates a strong involvement of the two re-entrant loops in conformational changes during the transport cycle. Moreover, the data for S 226 C and Q 319 C suggest that also the large extracellular loop is associated with transport function. Finally, the reciprocal voltage-dependencies of the S 155 C-E 451 C and S 226 C-Q 319 C pairs suggest reciprocal conformational changes during the transport cycle for their respective local environments...|$|R

In this study we describe the establishment of a new preclinical model of feline mammary carcinoma (FMC) using a recently established cancer cell line, DT 09 / 06. In addition, we evaluated a recombinant vaccinia virus strain, GLV- 5 <b>b</b> <b>451,</b> expressing the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) single-chain antibody (scAb) GLAF- 2 as an oncolytic agent against FMC.

In the selected xenografts of FMC, a single systemic administration of GLV- 5 <b>b</b> <b>451</b> led to significant inhibition of tumor growth in comparison to untreated tumor-bearing mice. Furthermore, tumor-specific virus infection led to overproduction of functional scAb GLAF- 2, which caused drastic reduction of intratumoral VEGF levels and inhibition of angiogenesis.

Group II received vehicle (1 mL/kg × <b>b.</b> <b>i.</b> d.) while Groups III-VII (drugs-treated) received subcutaneous histamine (100 μg/kg × <b>b.</b> <b>i.</b> d.), and intramuscular H 1 R-antagonist (pheniramine, 10 mg/kg × <b>b.</b> <b>i.</b> d.), H 2 R-antagonist (ranitidine, 10 mg/kg × <b>b.</b> <b>i.</b> d.), H 3 R-antagonist (iodophenpropit, 1 μg/kg × <b>b.</b> <b>i.</b> d.) and H 4 R-antagonist (JNJ 7777120, 10 μg/kg × <b>b.</b> <b>i.</b> d.), and Group VIII DMSO (1 mL/kg × <b>b.</b> <b>i.</b> d.), respectively for 10 days (starting from day 1). They were subsequently immunized with intravenous injection of sheep {{red blood cells}} (SRBC) at day 3. The estimation of serum Igs, IgM and IgG were done by ELISA, and observed at day 0 (pre-immunization), and 7, 14, 21, 28 and 58 (post-immunization). ResultsIt was shown that histamine and HRs-antagonists could influence a detectable antibody response to SRBC as early as day 7 -post-immunization (post-I), which lasted until day 58 post-I. The results were found statistically significant (P< 0. 05).

Materials and methods : The study was a prospective, single-center trial with a parallel group design. After the selection procedure, consecutive out-patients were assigned to one of six study groups using random sampling numbers. All patients received amoxicillin 1, 000 mg <b>b.</b> <b>i.</b> d. and clarithromycin 500 mg <b>b.</b> <b>i.</b> d. along with ranitidine bismuth citrate 400 mg <b>b.</b> <b>i.</b> d., or omeprazole 20 mg <b>b.</b> <b>i.</b> d., or lansoprazole 30 mg <b>b.</b> <b>i.</b> d., or rabeprazole 20 mg <b>b.</b> <b>i.</b> d., or pantoprazole 40 mg <b>b.</b> <b>i.</b> d., or esomeprazole 40 mg <b>b.</b> <b>i.</b> d. for 14 days.

However, exposure in allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients (n = 12) was 52 % lower than in non-BMT patients. Treatment-related adverse events (occurring in 24 % of patients) were mostly gastrointestinal in nature. Twenty-four percent of patients had adverse events leading to premature discontinuation (none were treatment related). In efficacy-evaluable patients, successful clinical response was observed in 43 % with rIFI (56 % of patients receiving 400 mg <b>b.</b> <b>i.</b> d., 17 % receiving 600 mg <b>b.</b> <b>i.</b> d., and 50 % receiving 800 mg q. d.) and 77 % with FN (74 % receiving 400 mg <b>b.</b> <b>i.</b> d., 78 % receiving 600 mg <b>b.</b> <b>i.</b> d., and 81 % receiving 800 mg q. d.). Posaconazole is well tolerated and absorbed. Divided doses of 800 mg (400 mg <b>b.</b> <b>i.</b> d.) provide the greatest posaconazole exposure...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper treats a {{class of}} {{combinatorial}} designs which are essentially partially balanced incomplete block designs with two associate classes and with the additional feature that there are constants s and t so that for any treatment-block pair (x, B), the number of first associates of x in the block B is s or t depending on whether x ϵ B or x ∉ B. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions that a P. <b>B.</b> <b>I.</b> <b>B.</b> D. should have this feature and obtain generalizations of earlier results on triangular and L 2 (n) P. <b>B.</b> <b>I.</b> <b>B.</b> D.

40|$|We survey definitions, known results, {{and open}} {{questions}} {{in the area of}} locally random reductions and explore the ramifications of these reductions in complexity theory. 1 Introduction We consider the question of whether a probabilistic polynomial-time machine A can compute a function f in the following manner. A interacts with one or more machines B 1, : : :, B k that are not restricted to probabilistic polynomial time. At the end of the interaction, A can use the information obtained from the <b>B</b> <b>i</b> 's to compute f(x). However, the information that A sends to the <b>B</b> <b>i</b> 's is locally random. Informally, this means that no individual <b>B</b> <b>i</b> can use it to figure out what A's private input x is. This study can be motivated by the practical problem of using shared resources for private computations. For example, f may be a financial service provided, for a fee, by the <b>B</b> <b>i</b> 's, and x may be A's personal financial position. Alternatively, the <b>B</b> <b>i</b> 's could be publicly supported supercomputing fa [...] ...|$|R
