5|$|Trollope {{expected}} his {{depiction of}} a fallen woman to be controversial, and unusually for him wrote a preface defending it. But the anticipated controversy never materialised, and contemporary reviewers tended to <b>ignore</b> <b>that</b> subplot, focussing instead on the courtship in the novel. Reviews were generally less than positive; many reviewers and readers who had acquired a taste for Trollope from the 1850s60s Barchester novels were unhappy about the darker tone of later novels such as this one.|$|E

25|$|Losts two-part pilot {{episode was}} the most {{expensive}} in the network's history, reportedly costing between US$10 and $14million, compared to {{the average cost of}} an hour-long pilot in 2005 of $4million. The world premiere of the pilot episode was on July 24, 2004, at Comic-Con International in San Diego. ABC's parent company Disney fired Braun before Losts broadcast debut, partly because of low ratings at the network and also because he had greenlighted such an expensive and risky project. The series debuted on September 22, 2004, becoming one of the biggest critical and commercial successes of the 2004 television season. Along with fellow new series Desperate Housewives and Grey's Anatomy, Lost helped to reverse the flagging fortunes of ABC, and its great success likely caused the network to <b>ignore</b> <b>that</b> the show almost immediately broke Lindelof and Abrams' promises to it regarding Losts plots.|$|E

She at first taught them to rub patients' heads, to [...] "lay [...] hands where the belief is to rub it out forever"; Kennedy would manipulate each student's head and solar plexus before class in preparation. The head rubbing was abandoned when the women complained about having to take their hair down, and the stomach rubbing held no appeal for them either.

[...] While writing the parts of the episode that involve international waters, the writers did research and found that the actual laws of international waters are more complex and ambiguous compared to what they had already written in the story, but they decided to <b>ignore</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The term lunar soil {{is often}} used interchangeably with [...] "lunar regolith" [...] but {{typically}} refers to the finer fraction of regolith, that which is composed of grains one centimetre in diameter or less.

[...] However, standard usage among lunar scientists is to <b>ignore</b> <b>that</b> distinction.

2500|$|Gay social {{clubs and}} groups {{were allowed to}} {{organize}} themselves freely, {{so long as they}} made tenuous links with Protestant Churches.

On July 1, 1968, the GDR adopted its own code of criminal law. In it §151 StGB-DDR provided for a sentence up to three years' imprisonment or probation for an adult (18 and over) who engaged in sexual acts with a youth (under 18) of the same sex. This law applied not only to men who have sex with boys but equally to women who have sex with girls.

2500|$|Creation science {{makes the}} a priori metaphysical {{assumption}} that {{there exists a}} creator of the life whose origin is being examined. Christian creation science holds that the description of creation is given in the Bible, that the Bible is inerrant in this description (and elsewhere), and therefore empirical scientific evidence must correspond with that description. Creationists also view the preclusion of all supernatural explanations within the sciences as a doctrinaire commitment to exclude the supreme being and miracles. They claim {{this to be the}} motivating factor in science's acceptance of Darwinism, a term used in creation science to refer to evolutionary biology which is also often used as a disparagement. Critics argue that creation science is religious rather than scientific because it stems from faith in a religious text rather than by the application of the scientific method. The United States National Academy of Sciences (NAS) has stated unequivocally, [...] "Evolution pervades all biological phenomena. To <b>ignore</b> <b>that</b> it occurred or to classify it as a form of dogma is to deprive the student of the most fundamental organizational concept in the biological sciences. No other biological concept has been more extensively tested and more thoroughly corroborated than the evolutionary history of organisms." [...] Anthropologist Eugenie Scott has noted further, [...] "Religious opposition to evolution propels antievolutionism. Although antievolutionists pay lip service to supposed scientific problems with evolution, what motivates them to battle its teaching is apprehension over the implications of evolution for religion." ...|$|E
2500|$|The schism between French and English Freemasonry is popularly {{supposed}} to originate at a general {{assembly of the}} Grand Orient de France in September 1877. Accepting a recommendation in a report by a Protestant minister, Frédéric Desmons, the assembly, on a majority vote, amended its constitutions to read [...] "Its principles are absolute liberty of conscience and human solidarity". The words [...] "Its principles are the existence of God, the immortality of the soul and human solidarity" [...] were struck out. The United Grand Lodge of England's (UGLE) response was a resolution in March 1878 that [...] "That the Grand Lodge, whilst always anxious to receive in the most fraternal spirit the Brethren of any Foreign Grand Lodge whose proceedings are conducted according to the Ancient Landmarks of the Order, of which a belief in T. G. A. O. T. U. (the Great Architect of the Universe) is {{the first and most}} important, cannot recognise as ‘true and genuine’ Brethren any who have been initiated in Lodges which either deny or <b>ignore</b> <b>that</b> belief". Relations between the two governing bodies effectively ceased, purportedly because the French body had removed the requirement for a belief in a supreme being. However, UGLE had just entered into fraternal relations with the Grand Orient of Belgium, which had removed the Great Architect from its constitutions in 1872, a relationship which lasted until 1921. The reasons for the split are obviously deeper and more complex than the official records suggest.|$|E
