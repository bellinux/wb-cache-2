500|$|In February 1948, the {{president}} submitted {{a civil rights}} agenda to Congress that proposed creating several federal offices devoted to issues such as voting rights and fair employment practices. This provoked a storm of criticism from southern Democrats in the runup to the national nominating convention, but Truman refused to compromise, saying: [...] "My forebears were Confederates... but my very stomach turned over when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> that Negro soldiers, just back from overseas, were being dumped out of Army trucks in Mississippi and beaten." [...] Tales of the abuse, violence, and persecution suffered by many African-American veterans upon their return from World War II infuriated Truman, and were {{a major factor in}} his decision to issue Executive Order 9981, in July 1948, requiring equal opportunity in the Armed Forces. [...] In the early 1950s after several years of planning, recommendations and revisions between Truman, the Committee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity and the various branches of the military, the services became racially integrated.|$|E
500|$|Smith {{died of a}} liver {{haemorrhage}} in June 1955, {{at the age of}} fifty, leaving £2000 in his will. The Smiths {{had rented}} their two first-floor bedrooms to students for extra income since 1947, while the Smiths slept in the former dining room; on the ground floor, {{at the back of the}} house. Some of the students who lodged there included John Cavill (from September 1949 until June 1950). Cavill played piano, but as the house had none he bought a guitar; admitting he knew almost nothing about chords: [...] "My father had a violin and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> to play pizzicato on it, so when I got the guitar I played tunes on the strings, and John [...] did the same". Michael Fishwick also lodged there (from October 1951 until December 1958), as did Keith Capron (September 1956 to July 1959). Both Capron and Cavill were studying veterinary science at the University of Liverpool, with Fishwick studying biochemistry.|$|E
500|$|The act was {{something}} that affected Kiedis significantly because he had never before experienced such an enlightening ideology on life. Growing up in Los Angeles, he had always thought differently from Hagen. Instead of giving material possessions away and being free thinking, the vocalist believed one must take what one wants, as {{no one else will}} provide. Instead, he now adopted Hagen's philosophy: [...] "It was such an epiphany that someone would want to give me her favorite thing. That stuck with me forever. Every time I'd be thinking 'I have to keep,' I'd remember 'No, you gotta give away instead.' When I started going regularly to [...] meetings, one of the principles <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> was that the way to maintain your own sobriety is to give it to another suffering alcoholic. Every time you empty your vessel of that energy, fresh new energy comes flooding in." [...] Flea's bassline for the song allowed Kiedis to recall this incident and he believed the music paired perfectly with the lyrics. During the verses, Kiedis departs from the idea of unselfishness and sings about a variety of topics including long-time friend River Phoenix, musician Bob Marley and various sexual themes including fertility and lust.|$|E

500|$|Olinda's {{position}} was precarious. [...] "He lacked {{the character and}} skills to impose his authority, while the attempts he did make to take control were seen as presumptuous, a usurpation of a position belonging to the emperor alone." [...] The [...] "generation of politicians {{who had come to}} power in the 1830s, following upon the abdication of Pedro <b>I,</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> from bitter experience the difficulties and dangers of government. By 1840 they had lost all faith in their ability to rule the country on their own. They accepted Pedro II as an authority figure whose presence was indispensable for the country's survival." [...] The Liberals took the dispute over lowering the age of majority directly to the populace, inciting them to place pressure on the politicians. The Brazilian people supported lowering the age of majority and a popular song was heard in the streets: [...] "We want Pedro the Second,/ Although he is not of age;/ The nation excuses the law,/ and long live the majority!" [...] As emperor, Pedro II [...] "was the living symbol of the unity of the fatherland [...] This position gave him, in the eyes of public opinion, a higher authority than that of any regent." [...] The Conservatives weren’t opposed to the Liberal plan, and both (including the regent himself, who would inevitably lose his office) wished to end the regency. Olinda asked Pedro II what he thought about the issue of majority, and he simply answered, [...] "I have not thought about that," [...] and continued, [...] "I have already heard about it, but I have not given it any attention." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{his years}} of musical study, Pavarotti held {{part-time}} jobs in order to sustain himself – first as {{an elementary school teacher}} and then as an insurance salesman. The first six years of study resulted in only a few recitals, all in small towns and without pay. When a nodule developed on his vocal cords, causing a [...] "disastrous" [...] concert in Ferrara, he decided to give up singing. Pavarotti attributed his immediate improvement to the psychological release connected with this decision. Whatever the reason, the nodule not only disappeared but, as he related in his autobiography: [...] "Everything <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> came together with my natural voice to make the sound I had been struggling so hard to achieve".|$|E

I also felt that I didn't really grow up until I had my children. There were ways that maturity was demanded of me and having children brought forth that maturity. So I wouldn't say my children were an inspiration in the sense of what I thought would have been a spiritual inspiration before I had children.
