40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the surface roughness and morphology of enamel with a surface roughness tester and scanning electron microscopy after the removal of metal brackets and polishing. Methods: Ten orthodontic patients were selected for the study. At the conclusion of orthodontic treatment, their metal brackets were removed. For each patient, teeth on one side of the mouth were randomly chosen for finishing and polishing with aluminum oxide discs (n = 10). Teeth on the other side were finished with multilaminated carbide burs (n = 10). Dental replicas (before and after tooth polishing) were obtained with epoxy resin. Three surface roughness measurements were made in different directions with an angle of 120 degrees among them, and a mean for each dental replica was calculated. The roughness data were statistically evaluated by repeated-measurements analysis of variance. Three specimens from each group were also used for scanning electron microscopy analysis. Results: After resin removal, the average roughness in the carbide bur group (0. 31 mu m) was significantly greater than that in the aluminum oxide disc group (0. 25 mm). Conclusions: The aluminum oxide <b>disc</b> <b>polishing</b> system resulted in less enamel roughness than did the multilaminated carbide bur system...|$|E

Unpolished specimens served as the control (C). The specimens were stored for 48 h in a coffee solution. The color of all specimens was measured before and after exposure with a colorimeter, and total color change (DE*) were calculated. The data were analyzed with a two-way ANOVA and the means were compared by Tukey HSD test (a= 0. 05). The lowest color difference was observed in the groups PdP and C, while the highest color difference was observed in PdPB, and PdB. When comparing the five different restorative materials, no significant difference was observed between FiltekP 60 and FiltekZ 250, and these materials demonstrated significantly less color change than Quadrant LC and the nanohybrid materials (Grandio, Filtek Supreme). The posterior (Filtek P 60) and universal (Filtek Z 250) composite resin restorative materials, which do not contain tetraethyleneglycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA), were found to be less stainable than the nanohybrid (Grandio, Filtek Supreme) and universal (Quadrant LC) composite resins, which contain TEGDMA.

It was a military and administrative centre which primarily functioned as a fortified farmstead, named a dunnu by the Assyrians. The goal of this thesis {{is to determine the}} character of the assemblage and to shed light on the function and role of the bone artefacts in the LBA society. In addition I have performed a diachronic analysis to find out whether the assemblage changed through time. The worked-bone assemblage is a relatively small but diverse. It comprises approximately 105 artefacts. A preliminary classification, based on morphology, is presented. The assemblage consists of three categories: bone tools, bone ornaments and other bone objects. The category bone tools comprise awls, combs, needles, spatulas and nails. The bone ornaments exist from beads, inlay, plaques and a bracelet. The other bone objects comprise <b>discs,</b> <b>polished</b> knucklebones and a number of miscellaneous objects. First, the function of the artefacts is analysed based on their morphology and when possible, traces of use. For some artefacts, the analysis of the morphology could not shed light on a plausible function. To further elucidate their function and role, the context of the artefacts was analysed. I have tried to elucidate in which areas of the LBA settlement the bone artefacts were used. From the context and morphology it appears that the worked-bone artefacts were used in domestic buildings, workshops and in open areas of the Late Bronze Age settlement. They were probably used for pottery production and in the production of basketry, matting and leather working. The bone objects had a diverse role in society as they were used as tools, jewellery, personal ornaments, game pieces and grave goods. They were present in every phase of the LBA occupation.

Thirty-five composite samples were made from each of the two composites. Uncured composite was placed into an aluminium ring mould, 10 mm X 2 mm. Both the upper and lower surfaces of the composite were covered with Mylar strips and glass plates, before the specimens were cured for 40 seconds from both sides. Samples were randomly divided into seven groups. The groups were: 1. Mylar polyester strip (control) 2. Sof-Lex XT finishing and <b>polishing</b> <b>discs</b> (3 M ESPE, St Paul, USA) 3. Sof-Lex Spiral Wheels (3 M ESPE, St Paul, USA) 4. Dura-White stones (Shofu Inc, Kyoto, Japan) 5. Intensiv UniglossCellbrush (Intensiv SA, Montagnola, Switzerland) 6. Enhance finishing and polishing system (Dentsply, Milford, USA) 7. Sof-Lex Spiral Wheels combined with Zircon-Brite (Dental Ventures of America, Corona, USA) The polishing of the specimens was performed by a single operator according to manufacturer s instructions. The mean surface roughness of each specimen was determined using a profilometer (Surftest SJ 210, Mitutoyo, Tokyo, Japan). Three readings were collected from each specimen. Data was statistically analysed using ANOVA. Scanning Electron Microscope (JEOL JSM- 5800 LV, Tokyo, Japan) photos were taken of the representative samples. Results: Statistically significant differences in surface roughness were observed between the following groups: Z 100 and Filtek Supreme XTE with the polishing systems combined (p= 0. 005); Control group vs all the polishing systems; Sof-Lex XT finishing and <b>polishing</b> <b>discs</b> vs Dura-White stones, Intensiv UniglossCellbrush, Enhance finishing and polishing system (p < 0. 0001); Sof-Lex Spiral Wheels vs Dura-White stones, Intensiv Unigloss Cellbrush, Enhance finishing and polishing system (p < 0. 0001); Dura-White stones vs Intensiv UniglossCellbrush, Enhance finishing and polishing system, Sof-Lex Spiral Wheels/Zircon-Brite (p < 0. 0001); Intensiv UniglossCellbrush vs. Spiral Wheels/Zircon-Brite (p< 0. 0001); Enhance finishing and polishing system vs. Spiral Wheels/Zircon-Brite (p < 0. 0001). Conclusion: Filtek Supreme XTE displayed significantly better polishability and lower surface roughness values after polishing than Z 100. The composite samples cured against the Mylar polyester strip produced significantly smoother surface roughness values than all the polishing systems tested in this study. The following polishing systems led to the smoothest surfaces after polishing: Sof-lex Spiral Wheels in combination with Zircon-Brite, as well as the Sof-Lex Spiral Wheels and Sof-Lex finishing and <b>polishing</b> <b>discs.</b> These systems were significantly smoother than the Enhance system used in combination with Prisma Gloss polishing paste, and also the one-step polishing system Intensiv UniglossCellbrush.

40|$|Prosthetic and osteosynthetic {{implants}} from metal alloys will be indispensable in orthopedic surgery, {{as long as}} {{tissue engineering}} and biodegradable bone substitutes do not lead to products that will be applied in clinical routine for the repair of bone, cartilage, and joint defects. Therefore, the elucidation of the interactions between the periprosthetic tissues and the implant remains of clinical relevance and several factors are known to affect the longevity of implants. Within this study, the effects of metal particles and surface topography on the recruitment of osteoclasts was investigated in vitro in a coculture of osteoblasts and bone marrow cells. The cells were grown {{in the presence of}} particles of different sizes and chemical composition or on metal <b>discs</b> with <b>polished</b> or sandblasted surfaces, respectively. At the end of the culture, newly formed osteoclasts were counted. Osteoclastogenesis was reduced when particles were added directly to the coculture. The effect depended {{on the size of the}} particles, small particles exerting stronger effects than larger ones. The chemical composition of the particles, however, did not affect the development of osteoclasts. In cocultures grown on sandblasted surfaces, osteoclasts developed at higher rates than they did in cultures on polished surfaces. The data demonstrate that wear particles and implant surfaces affect osteoclastogenesis and thus may be involved in the induction of local bone resorption and the formation of osteolytic lesions, leading eventually to the loosening of orthopedic implants...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} the evolution of nanostructures on the SLActive surface, as a function of time, storage conditions, material dependence and to identify the step in which the reorganization of the outermost titanium oxide layer into well defined nanostructures takes place. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Titanium grade 2 discs were surface modified in seven different modes; (1) SLA (sand blasted, large grit, acid etched) protocol. (2) SLActive protocol (SLA stored in 0. 9 % NaCl solution), (3) SLActive, but stored in water instead of 0. 9 % NaCl solution, (4) pmod SLA: SLA discs subjected to oxygen plasma cleaning and stored in 0. 9 % NaCl solution, (5) SLAnano: SLActive discs aged for several months and then dried, (6) Mod A: same etching procedure and storage as for SLActive, but no sand blasting prior to etching, (7) pmod P: the <b>discs</b> were <b>polished,</b> oxygen plasma cleaned and stored in 0. 9 % NaCl solution. In addition TiZr alloy discs were prepared like the Ti SLActive samples. The surfaces were evaluated with SEM, interferometry, contact angle measurements and XPS. RESULTS: The samples stored dry were hydrophobic whereas the discs stored in liquid were hydrophilic. The evolution of nanostructures took 2  weeks, thereafter they were stable over time. The nanostructures occured after storage both in water and NaCl solution. Nanostructures were formed on Ti and TiZr although the morphology and distribution was quite different between the two materials. CONCLUSIONS: Acid etching in conjunction with storage in aqueous solution is responsible for the reorganization of the outermost titanium oxide layer into well defined nanostructures...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{assess the}} {{influence}} of finishing/polishing procedure on color stability (ΔE) and surface roughness (Ra) of composites (Heliomolar and Tetric - color A 2) submitted to accelerated artificial aging (AAA). Materials and Methods : Sixty test specimens were made of each composite (12 mm × 2  mm) and separated into six groups (n = 10), according {{to the type of}} finishing/polishing to which they were submitted: C, control; F, tip 3195 F; FF, tip 3195 FF; FP, tip 3195 F + diamond paste; FFP, tip 3195 FF + diamond paste; SF, Sof-Lex <b>discs.</b> After <b>polishing,</b> controlled by an electromechanical system, initial color (spectrophotometer PCB 6807 BYK GARDNER) and Ra (roughness meter Surfcorder SE 1700, cut-off 0. 25 mm) readings were taken. Next, the test specimens were submitted to the AAA procedure (C-UV Comexim) for 384 hours, {{and at the end of}} this period, new color readings and R a were taken. Results: Statistical analysis [2 -way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Bonferroni, P < 0. 05] showed that all composites demonstrated ΔE alteration above the clinically acceptable limits, with the exception of Heliomolar composite in FP. The greatest ΔE alteration occurred for Tetric composite in SF (13. 38 ± 2. 10) statistically different from F and FF (P < 0. 05). For Ra, Group F showed rougher samples than FF with statistically significant difference (P < 0. 05). Conclusion: In spite of the surface differences, the different finishing/polishing procedures were not capable of providing color stability within the clinically acceptable limits...|$|R
40|$|Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) {{recently}} attracts {{many applications}} in orthopaedics such as intervertebral spacer, spinal cage and prosthesis. However, literatures suggest {{this material is}} bio-inert in nature. Its inferior bioactivity may lead to poor bone-implant interaction. Some researchers incorporated hydroxyapatite or tri-calcium phosphate in PEEK to enhance its bioactivity. Mechanical properties such as elasticity and fatigue may, however, alter as material micro-structure has been changed. To avoid it, surface modification is therefore an alternative. This pilot study aims to investigate the feasibility of bioactivity enhancement of PEEK using an advance surface technique named plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII). PEEK <b>discs</b> were <b>polished</b> and undertaken PIII treatment with plasma sources such as water, ammonia and strontium at 15 kV at 50 Hz for 2 hours. Afterwards, surface morphology, roughness, elemental chemical profile, chemical bonding and hydrophilicity were examined by SEM, AFM, XPS, FT-IR, and contact angle measurement respectively. Bioactivity was evaluated by simulated body fluid immersion test at day 21 and cytotoxicity was assessed by MC 3 T 3 E 1 cell culturing at day 2 and 5. The surface roughness slightly decreases after water and ammonium PIII, whereas it increases after strontium PIII. The surface contact angle of the treated samples reduces, but surface energy increases. Literatures suggested these changes favour cell attachment and proliferation. In our cell culture experiment, cells have attached more on the treated surfaces. All these results preliminarily demonstrate the feasibility of PIII treatment to enhance bioactivity of PEEK. Further study will focus on in vivo testing. The 24 th Triennial World Congress (SICOT/SIROT 2008), Hong Kong, China, 24 - 28 August 2008...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this in vitro {{research}} project was to evaluate and compare the wear behavior of human tooth enamel opposing monolithic zirconia and other different ceramic restorative materials and also to observe the tetragonal to monoclinic phase transformation in zirconia-based ceramics that may occur while simulating wear occurring at room temperature in a wet environment. Materials and Methods: A total of sixty samples were prepared for this study. Fifteen discs of glazed zirconia, 15 <b>discs</b> of <b>polished</b> zirconia without glaze, 15 discs of metal ceramic, and 15 discs of lithium disilicate were fabricated. Sixty extracted premolars were collected and randomly divided into four groups of 15 each. The discs and extracted human premolars were placed onto holders on a two-body wear machine under a constant load of 5 kg to simulate the oral wear cycle. A diffractometer was used to analyze phase transformation. One-way analysis of variance and Tukey's post hoc tests was used. Results: The mean loss of height of tooth samples and its standard deviation for Group I (monolithic zirconia with glaze), Group II (mechanically polished monolithic zirconia without glaze), Group III (porcelain fused to metal), and Group IV (glazed monolithic lithium disilicate) was obtained as 0. 2716 ± 0. 1409, 0. 1240 ± 0. 0625, 0. 1567 ± 0. 0996, and 0. 2377 ± 0. 1350, respectively. The highest mean loss in height was observed in Group I and the least was observed in Group II. Conclusion: Mechanically polished zirconia showed {{the least amount of}} enamel wear followed by porcelain fused to metal and glazed monolithic lithium disilicate, whereas glazed monolithic zirconia showed the highest enamel wear...|$|R
40|$|Presence of {{diastema}} between {{anterior teeth}} is often considered an onerous esthetic problem. Various treatment modalities {{are available for}} diastema closure. However, not all diastemas can be treated the same in terms of modality or timing. The extent and the etiology of the diastema must be properly evaluated. Proper case selection {{is of paramount importance}} for a successful treatment. In this case report, diastema closure was performed with direct composite restorations. One bottle etch-and-rinse adhesive was used and a single shade was used to close the diastemas. Contoured sectional posterior matrix was used to achieve anatomic contouring of the proximal surfaces of the teeth. This was followed by finishing and <b>polishing</b> using <b>polishing</b> <b>discs.</b> Patient was kept on recall every 6 months. Conclusion. Diastema closure with correct anatomic contouring is easy to perform using the contoured sectional matrices. At 14 -month recall, no clinical signs of failure like discoloration or fracture were evident. Also, patient did not complain of any sensitivity. Thus, direct composite restorations serve as durable and highly esthetic restorations leading to complete patient satisfaction...|$|R
40|$|Background/purpose: To {{evaluate}} the surface roughness {{of the metal}} ceramic VITA VMK 95, a standard dental porcelain used for metal-ceramic restorations. Materials and methods: Glazed ceramic blocks of VITA VMK 95 were grinded using a rugby-shaped diamond bur in order to mimic the chairside-adjustment process and then polished using two polishing techniques. Polishing was performed using Sof-Lex discs or Sof-Lex <b>discs</b> followed by <b>polishing</b> with brushes and a prophylaxis paste. To {{evaluate the}} surface roughness, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using the Genie digital image capture system were performed. Average roughness (Ra), {{root mean square roughness}} (Rq), valley roughness (Rv), and peak roughness (Rp) were evaluated using CLSM. Results: The results were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance with the post hoc Tukey test at a significance level of 5 %. There were statistically significant differences between the rough group and the two polished groups (P 0. 05). Conclusions: Although the Sof-Lex discs significantly reduced the surface roughness, their use with the prophylaxis paste and polishing brushes did not cause a further reduction in the surface roughness...|$|R
