25|$|In the end, {{options for}} the {{financing}} of the purchase came down to two companies, Westpac and Allco Leasing. One {{of the more interesting}} notes to the Allco proposal was the nature of the financing arrangements it was proposing. At the time of the proposed financing deal, interest rates in Australia were around 16-17%, placing a significant burden on companies in their business dealings. To work around this, Allco proposed a financing structure that involved a cross-border <b>financing</b> <b>arrangement</b> in Japan. It also required the establishment of a special purposes lessor company, incorporated in the Cayman Islands, to minimise withholding tax liabilities from the Japanese and Australian taxation agencies. Allco refused to release specific information on the proposed structure, due to its policy prohibiting the release of specific details of this <b>financing</b> <b>arrangement</b> until it had secured a mandate for their services.|$|E
25|$|She once {{lost the}} huge sum of 84,000 francs—some of it borrowed—in one {{evening at the}} table at the court of Fontainebleau, to card cheats. To quickly raise the money to pay back her debts, she devised an ingenious <b>financing</b> <b>arrangement</b> similar to modern derivatives, whereby she paid tax {{collectors}} a fairly low sum for the right to their future earnings (they were allowed to keep a portion of the taxes they collected for the King), and promised to pay the court gamblers part of these future earnings.|$|E
25|$|When {{the project}} commenced, it was {{believed}} that Westrail, then responsible for the provision and management of metropolitan rail transport for Transperth, would not have enough rolling stock to operate the new line. Further to that, the funding available to Westrail would not permit the purchase of rolling stock from current or future operating funds. On 20 November 1989, the State Cabinet allowed Westrail to pursue an operating lease to permit the acquisition of the required 22 2-car A-series trains. On 30 November 1989, the contract to construct the trains was awarded to Walkers-ABB despite a funding deal not being in place. Westrail sought out a <b>financing</b> <b>arrangement</b> to enable the purchase.|$|E

25|$|The Government of South Africa {{has set up}} the South African Renewables Initiative (SARi) {{to develop}} a <b>financing</b> <b>arrangement</b> that would enable a {{critical}} mass of renewables to be developed in South Africa, through a combination of international loans and grants, as well as domestic funding. This has been a highly successful programme now known as the REIPPP (Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Programme) with four rounds of allocations already completed. In Round 1, 19 projects were allocated, in Round 2, 28 projects were allocated, in Round 3, 17 projects were allocated and in Round 4, 26 projects were allocated. Over 6100MW has been allocated with a total of R194 billion (US$16 billion) being invested in this programme. It {{is important to note that}} this investment figure represents full funding from private entities and banks - there are no government subsidies for this programme.|$|E
500|$|Union Bank of Switzerland, {{suffering}} {{criticism of}} its conservative business model, {{was looking for}} ways to catch up to its key Swiss rivals and viewed LTCM as the type of client that could help accelerate the bank's growth. In 1997, UBS entered into a <b>financing</b> <b>arrangement</b> with LTCM and the hedge fund quickly became the bank's largest client, generating US$15million in fees for UBS. [...] Union Bank of Switzerland sold LTCM a 7-year European call option on 1million shares in LTCM, then valued at about US$800million. It hedged this option by purchasing a US$800million interest in LTCM and invested a further US$300million in the hedge fund. Following the merger, Swiss Bank managers were surprised to discover the massive exposure to LTCM at UBS. [...] Ultimately, UBS was unable to sell or hedge its interest in LTCM as its value declined in the summer of 1998.|$|E
500|$|The 1990s {{brought an}} {{opportunity}} to expand operations in the airport management sector, as many countries privatised their airports. When Warsaw Frederic Chopin Airport needed upgrading in the early 1990s, LOT Polish Airlines was unable to afford the cost, so a complex <b>financing</b> <b>arrangement</b> was established whereby a bank would pay Hochtief {{two thirds of the}} costs to upgrade the airport, while the airline assigned to the bank the revenues from aircraft using Polish airspace for a period. The company began to take responsibility for more operational aspects of projects, including service provision, financing, facility management and software development, following a concept of being a [...] "system leader", as set out by CEO Hans-Peter Keitel. These tasks were felt to be higher up the value chain, and would help the firm shake off the slowdown that had followed the initial boom of German reunification. These concepts were notably put into action during the construction of the new Athens International Airport in the late 1990s.|$|E

2500|$|An {{innovative}} <b>financing</b> <b>arrangement</b> pioneered in Berkeley, California, and Palm Springs, lends {{money to}} a homeowner for a solar system, to be repaid via an additional tax assessment on the property for 20 years. [...] This allows installation {{of the solar system}} at [...] "relatively little up-front cost to the property owner." [...] Now known as PACE, for Property Assessed Clean Energy, it is available in 28 states. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae have objected to the repayment of solar loans being senior to mortgage loans, and some states have relegated PACE loans to junior loans. HR 2599 was introduced to prevent interference with the PACE program by other lenders. The principle feature of the program is that the balance of the loan is transferred to the new owners in the event the property is sold, and the loan is paid for entirely through electric bill savings. Unlike a mortgage loan, no funds are transferred when the property is sold - only the repayment obligation is transferred.|$|E
2500|$|The {{last major}} issue of Chavous' third term {{on the council}} was funding for Nationals Park. Major League Baseball was willing to move the Montreal Expos to Washington, D.C., which had long sought a major-league {{baseball}} franchise, {{but only if the}} city built a modern, baseball-only stadium for the team. By early June 2003, most of the District Council opposed the initial financing plan submitted by Williams. [...] Chavous was the lone undecided councilmember. (Harold Brazil was the only supporter.) Chavous supported the stadium plan only after he had lost the September 14 Democratic primary. But he remained largely quiet during council debates, and was still considered a swing vote by November. On November 3, he provided the critical third vote on the council's Economic Development Committee, which approved the stadium deal. Twenty-seven days later, he joined with a narrow majority on the council to win final approval for the project.
