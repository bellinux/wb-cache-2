40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{the experience and}} results of programs designed to operationalize the technology transfer provisions of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). These programs share a common goal of demonstrating modalities for <b>developed</b> <b>country</b> <b>parties</b> to fulfill their obligation under the UNFCCC to support technology transfer to developing country parties that facilitates their participation in global efforts to combat climate change. Several related U. S. bilateral programs and programs supported by the Climate Technology Initiative, a multilateral effort {{on behalf of a}} number of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, are included in this review. The discussion highlights a number of common elements of the approaches of many of these programs as well as some differences.

40|$|The Principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities (hereinafter {{referred}} to as CBDR) {{is one of the}} most effective principles in the international environmental law legal regime. It entails two elements: common responsibility and differentiated responsibility. Common responsibility describes the shared obligations of two or more States towards the protection of a particular environmental resource. Differentiated responsibility entails the need to take into account the different circumstances, particularly each State’s contribution to the evolution of a particular problem and its ability to prevent, reduce and control the threat. CBDR in the climate regime incorporates perspectives on states’ historical contributions to global environmental degradation and incorporates fairness and justice elements to be taken into account when devising relevant legal commitments. The rationale for CBDR in the climate regime is that owing to the fact that industrial countries bear the overwhelming responsibility for historical GHG emissions they should bear the primary burden of averting climate change. Accordingly, under the climate regime, <b>developed</b> <b>country</b> <b>parties</b> are required to take up mitigation commitments and targets. While developing countries are exempted from such commitments. This study established that non-participation of developing countries in the climate mitigation effort on the basis of CBDR is the main challenge of CBDR in the climate regime. The thesis therefore makes a case for global participation in the climate mitigation effort...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{private sector}} {{is one of the}} sources of finance {{included}} in developed countries’ pledge in the UN climate negotiations to mobilise $ 100 billion annually by 2020 to support developing countries’ efforts to address climate change. For adaptation in particular, it remains unclear what mobilised private finance is. Research so far has focused on its potential and experiences in developing countries, but not on the arguments of those who introduced and continue to advocate private adaptation finance: developed countries. This paper investigates the positions of developed countries and development banks and agencies. In particular, it aims to identify whether those actors can reach a common understanding of private adaptation finance that minimises norm conflicts in a fragmented climate finance system. Empirically, the paper examines the Biennial Reports and submissions on Strategies and Approaches for Mobilising Scaled-up Finance of six <b>developed</b> <b>country</b> <b>parties,</b> as well as data from interviews with experts from development banks and agencies. The analysis finds a number of discrepancies between these sets of actors, for example on motivations for and modes of private sector involvement. This discrepancy is the result of ambiguity around the concept of private adaptation finance in a highly fragmented climate finance architecture. This ambiguity is problematic when the aim of mobilising private adaptation finance is to contribute to the $ 100 billion commitment. However, if the aim is adaptation in practice, both ambiguity and fragmentation might actually make the climate finance system more inclusive and innovative...|$|E

The five workshops were held in: Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, from 19 to 23 October 2009; Bamako, Mali, from 8 to 12 February 2010; Vientiane, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, from 4 to 8 May 2010; Sao Tome, Sao Tome and Principe, from 4 to 8 September 2010; and Apia, Samoa, from 3 to 6 November 2010. They focused on providing participants with hands-on training in the design and preparation of proposals for the implementation of adaptation projects identified in NAPAs, and in the subsequent submission of these proposals to the GEF to receive support under the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF). In addition, the workshops addressed barriers and challenges faced by least <b>developed</b> <b>country</b> <b>Parties</b> in accessing funding under the LDCF. Countries were grouped for the workshops according to their language and regional similarities, in order to provide a platform for learning and sharing experience and to exploit synergies.

40|$|This thesis explores a {{framework}} for understanding why sustainable consumption could be important to address further in future development of the UN climate change agenda, which has been developed under the Framework Convention of Climate Change (UNFCCC). The ultimate objective of the Convention, and objectives concerning equity in relation to developing country needs, have been the target (and the normative warrant) of the study. A multidisciplinary perspective related to policy analysis {{has been used as}} a theoretical and methodological research framework. This investigation has focused on four main areas; the policy content of the UNFCCC and some proceeding documents, policy content on sustainable development which have been adopted in UN fora, summaries of research results on greenhouse gas emission trends and global footprints, and lastly, material which convey official standpoints of developing and developed country representatives. A conclusion drawn from this study is that a consumption perspective of sustainable development is found in UN policies on sustainable development, but is largely missing in the current climate change agenda. A second conclusion is that there is a lot of research which back up the thought that a consumption perspective is important in addition to a production perspective. This also seems to be a conclusion which in well established in parts of the UN such as the UNEP, and incorporated in key documents on sustainable development. A third conclusion is that there are reasons to believe that <b>developed</b> <b>country</b> <b>parties</b> will try to downplay a focus on consumption. In total these are the main points which are presented as {{a framework}} for understanding why a greater inclusion of sustainable consumption in the agenda could be important...|$|E

40|$|At the 13 th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, held in Bali in 2007, the COP {{decided to}} launch a process to reach an agreed outcome at its 15 th session held in Copenhagen in 2009. This decision, known as the Bali Action Plan, {{contains}} two subparagraphs that set out broadly the parameters within which future possible legal obligations pertaining to developed and developing nations regarding the mitigation of climate change are to be addressed {{as part of this}} process as per the decision. The purpose of addressing these obligations is to enable the implementation of the Convention, so the subparagraphs should have a basis in the Convention. One subparagraph deals with future possible legal obligations pertaining to <b>developed</b> <b>country</b> <b>Parties</b> and the other deals with those pertaining to developing country Parties. The content of each subparagraph differs and therefore a fundamental difference in the future possible legal obligations pertaining to developed and developing country Parties is pre-defined within the Bali Action Plan. This difference, as it is perceived by most developing country Parties, has become known colloquially as the Bali firewall. This article will set out the content of the pre-defined sets of parameters and investigate the basis for this content, and difference in content in relation to the other, in the provisions and principles set out in the Convention. It will then conclude on the validity of the Bali firewall in terms of the content of the Convention. Additionally it will analyse whether the ‘outcome’ of the 15 th Conference of the Parties falls in line with the future legal obligations of member states within the climate regime as perceived by most developing country Parties in terms of the Bali firewall. Lastly it will analyse member states’ future legal obligations within the climate change regime {{in the context of the}} overall objective of the Convention and the changing situation of the Parties over time...|$|E
40|$|Article 4. 8 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) {{provides}} that ‘Parties shall give full consideration to … {{the impact of}} the implementation of response measures, especially on … (h) Countries whose economies are highly dependent on income generated from the production, processing and export, and/or on consumption of fossil fuels and associated energy intensive products’. Article 2. 3 of the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC requires that <b>developed</b> <b>country</b> <b>Parties</b> (Annex I) ‘shall strive to implement policies and measures … in such a way to minimize … effects on international trade’ as well as minimizing the adverse effects on developing country Parties (Article 3. 14). If Annex I Parties implement mitigation, they are assumed to buy less oil, coal or other fossil fuels. In this context, response measures are actions taken or initiated by developed countries (Annex 1) but with the impacts and ramifications flowing on to developing countries. The concern of developing countries, therefore, is in those impacts which {{to a greater or lesser}} extent depend on the degree of exposure of developing countries to trade (with or without the implementation of corresponding climate measures within the developing countries themselves). The South African economy derives much of its growth from production related to the energy-intensive sectors of its economy. In general, with the climate negotiations on the future of the climate regime post- 2012, the implications for energy-intensive and trade-exposed sectors of the economy need to be clearly understood. This research confirms findings of previous studies (see Section 1. 3), that the impacts of response measures may imply losses of exports in some sectors, but also possibly gains in other sectors. In this report the scenarios examined are broader than those examined under an earlier Fund of Research into Industrial Development, Growth and Equity (FRIDGE) study. In particular, this study highlights the impacts which response measures have on sectors other than the manufacturing sector, including mining, agriculture and tourism. The present report has provided a more specific identification of energy-intensive and trade-intensive sectors – and those that are both energy- and trade-intensive. We have also examined variations related to scenarios with and without emission trading among Annex I countries, and extended this to the consideration of a no-lose crediting approach for non-Annex I (NAI) countries...|$|E
