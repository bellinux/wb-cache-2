60|$|Although in {{the case}} of uninjured flower-stems and leaves the {{carbonate}} seems to be absorbed only by the glands, yet it enters a cut surface much more quickly than a gland. Strips of the rind of a flower-stem were torn off, and the cells of the pedicels were seen to contain only colourless transparent fluid; those of the glands including as usual some <b>granular</b> <b>matter.</b> These strips were then immersed in the same solution as before (one part of the carbonate to 109 of water), and in a few minutes <b>granular</b> <b>matter</b> appeared in the lowercells of all the pedicels. The action invariably commenced (for I tried the experiment repeatedly) in the lowest cells, and therefore close to the torn surface, and then gradually travelled up the hairs until it reached the glands, in a reversed direction to what occurs in uninjured specimens. The glands then became discoloured, and the previously contained <b>granular</b> <b>matter</b> was aggregated into larger masses. Two short bits of a flower-stem were also left for 2 hrs. 40 m. in a weaker solution of one part of the carbonate to 218 of water; and in both specimens the pedicels of the hairs near the cut ends now contained much granular matter; and the glands were completely discoloured.|$|E
60|$|Some of {{the closed}} leaves {{contained}} no prey, {{but in one}} there was a rather large beetle, which from its flattened tibiae I suppose was an aquatic species, but was not allied to Colymbetes. All the softer tissues of this beetle were completely dissolved, and its chitinous integuments were as clean {{as if they had}} been [page 329] boiled in caustic potash; so that it must have been enclosed for a considerable time. The glands were browner and more opaque than those on other leaves which had caught nothing; and the quadrifid processes, from being partly filled with brown <b>granular</b> <b>matter,</b> could be plainly distinguished, which was not the case, as already stated, on the other leaves. Some of the points on the infolded margins likewise contained brownish <b>granular</b> <b>matter.</b> We thus gain additional evidence that the glands, the quadrifid processes, and the marginal points, all have the power of absorbing matter, though probably of a different nature.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: We report {{experimental}} results for stripe patterns {{appearing on the}} surface of <b>granular</b> <b>matters</b> under gravity.

40|$|Many {{approaches}} of coarse-graining {{have been developed}} under the names of Cosserat theory or polar-fluid theory, for those materials in which some component elements undergo non-affine deformations, such as elastic materials with inclusions or <b>granular</b> <b>matters.</b> For the complex elements such as living cells, however, the microscopic variables and their dynamics are often unknown, {{and there have been}} no systematic theory of coarse-graining from the microscales, nor the formulas like Irving-Kirkwood formula that constitutes the macroscopic stress or couple-stress in terms of some microscale quantities. We show that, for the quasi-steady states, the coarse-graining procedure must generally provides with the Cosserat-type balance equations as long as the procedure keeps track of the conservation of linear and angular momenta, and that the fluxes of these conserved quantities should generally be expressed in the Irving-Kirkwood-type formulas, where the inter- particle distance or forces/torques should be replaced by those associated to the pair of neighboring coarse-graining volumes. This framework, which refers to no particular micro-variables or dynamics, is valid for active complex matters out of equilibrium and with any multi-body interactions.

60|$|Lastly, bits of meat {{were placed}} on some glands; these were {{examined}} after 23 hrs., as were others, which had apparently not long before caught minute flies; {{but they did not}} present any [page 348] difference from the glands of other hairs. Perhaps there may not have been time enough for absorption. I think so as some glands, on which dead flies had evidently long lain, were of a pale dirty purple colour or even almost colourless, and the <b>granular</b> <b>matter</b> within them presented an unusual and somewhat peculiar appearance. That these glands had absorbed animal matter from the flies, probably by exosmose into the viscid secretion, we may infer, not only from their changed colour, but because, when placed in a solution of carbonate of ammonia, some of the cells in their pedicels become filled with granular matter; whereas the cells of other hairs, which had not caught flies, after being treated with the same solution for the same length of time, contained only a small quantity of <b>granular</b> <b>matter.</b> But more evidence is necessary before we fully admit that the glands of this saxifrage can absorb, even with ample time allowed, animal matter from the minute insects which they occasionally and accidentally capture.|$|E
60|$|It may {{be worth}} while briefly to {{consider}} {{a few of these}} collateral proofs that the chalk was deposited {{at the bottom of the}} sea.

60|$|I made also several {{experiments}} {{on the action}} of the vapour of the carbonate on the glands; but will give only a few cases. The cut end of the footstalk of a young leaf was protected with sealing-wax, and was then placed under a small bell-glass, with a large pinch of the carbonate. After 10 m. the glands showed a considerable degree of aggregation, and the protoplasm lining the cells of the pedicels was a little separated from the walls. Another leaf was left for 50 m. with the same result, excepting that the hairs became throughout their whole length of a brownish colour. In a third leaf, which was exposed for 1 hr. 50 m., there was much aggregated matter in the glands; and some of the masses showed signs of breaking up into brown <b>granular</b> <b>matter.</b> This leaf was again placed in the vapour, so that it was exposed altogether for 5 hrs. 30 m.; and now, though I examined a large number of glands, aggregated masses were found in only two or three; in all the others, the masses, which before had been globular, were converted into brown, opaque, <b>granular</b> <b>matter.</b> We thus see that exposure to the vapour for a considerable time produces the same effects as long immersion in a strong solution. In both cases there could hardly be a doubt that the salt had been absorbed chiefly or exclusively by the glands.|$|E

60|$|Mirabilis longiflora.--The {{stems and}} both {{surfaces}} of the leaves bear viscid hairs. young plants, from 12 to 18 inches in height in my greenhouse, caught so many minute Diptera, Coleoptera, and larvae, that they were quite dusted with them. The hairs are short, of unequal lengths, formed of a single row of cells, surmounted by an enlarged cell which secretes viscid matter. These terminal cells or glands contain granules and often globules of <b>granular</b> <b>matter.</b> Within a gland which had caught a small insect, one such mass was observed to undergo incessant changes of form, with the occasional appearance of vacuoles. But I {{do not believe that}} this protoplasm had been generated by matter absorbed from the dead insect; for, on comparing several glands which had and had not caught insects, not a shade of difference could be perceived between them, and they all contained fine <b>granular</b> <b>matter.</b> A piece of leaf was immersed for 24 hrs. in a solution of one part of carbonate of ammonia to 218 of water, but the hairs seemed very little affected by it, excepting that perhaps the glands were rendered rather more opaque. In the leaf itself, however, the grains of chlorophyll near the cut surfaces had run together, or become aggregated. Nor were the glands on another leaf, after an immersion for 24 hrs. in an infusion of raw meat, in the least affected; but the protoplasm lining the cells of the pedicels had shrunk greatly from the walls. This latter effect may have been due to exosmose, as the infusion was strong. We may, therefore, conclude that the glands of this plant either have no power of absorption or that the protoplasm which they contain is not acted on by a solution of carbonate of ammonia (and this seems scarcely credible) or by an infusion of meat.|$|E
40|$|It is well {{recognized}} that matter has a discrete nature, but this aspect is usually considered {{only at the}} nano and microscale, {{on the other hand}} at the meso and macroscale levels compact matter is represented with a continuous model. At the macroscopic scales can be usefully adopted a discrete model of solids, without losing accuracy in the description of the main mechanical involved phenomena; when a multiscale study of solids is necessary the discrete approach, tailored to the scale of observation of interest, allows complete and exhaustive descriptions of many phenomena. This PhD thesis presents a general computational particle method suitable for analyzing the dynamic behaviour of compact solids as well as <b>granular</b> <b>matters.</b> The particle interaction is modelled through proper force functionals related {{to the nature of the}} material being analyzed (solid, granular or their interaction); such an approach is also adopted for the boundary and for the particle-particle contacts, so a unified mechanical model can be simply adopted for the simulation of a very wide class of mechanical problems under static or dynamic conditions. In particular the failure of brittle solids under dynamic dynamic impact can be easily predicted, avoiding the necessity of complex remeshing operations, stress field enrichment or the introduction of discontinuous displacement field, as typically required by numerical continuous approaches such as the finite element method. Moreover the discrete approach allows to simply model mechanical problems involving large displacements, friction or frictionless interactions with elastic boundaries, fragmentation and clustering of the failed material as well as cohesion in particle-like matters. Some examples aimed at demonstrating the versatility of the developed approach are finally presented: in particular the problems involving the failure of continuous solid elements under impact loading, confined particle flows and solid-granular materials interaction are simulated through the proposed approach and the related results are critically discussed and, when available, compared with literature data...|$|R

If the tentacles of a young, yet fully matured leaf, that has never been excited or become inflected, be examined, the cells forming the pedicels are seen to be filled with homogeneous, purple fluid. The walls are lined by a layer of colourless, circulating protoplasm; but this can be seen with much greater distinctness after the process of aggregation has been partly effected than before. The purple fluid which exudes from a crushed tentacle is somewhat coherent, and does not mingle with the surrounding water; it contains much flocculent or <b>granular</b> <b>matter.</b> But this matter may have been generated by the cells having been crushed; some degree of aggregation having been thus almost instantly caused.

60|$|The {{plants were}} {{collected}} {{in the middle of}} July; and the contents of five bladders, which from their opacity seemed full of prey, were examined. The first contained no less than twenty-four minute fresh-water crustaceans, most of them consisting of empty shells, or including only a few drops of red oily matter; the second contained twenty; the third, fifteen; the fourth, ten, some of them being rather larger than usual; and the fifth, which seemed stuffed quite full, contained only seven, but five of these were of unusually large size. The prey, therefore, judging from these five bladders, consists exclusively of fresh-water crustaceans, most of which appeared to be distinct species from those found in the bladders of the two former species. In one bladder the quadrifids in contact with a decaying mass contained numerous spheres of <b>granular</b> <b>matter,</b> which slowly changed their forms and positions.|$|E
60|$|The glands {{on a young}} flower-stem, {{after having}} been left for 2 hrs. 45 m. in a strong {{solution}} of {{one part of the}} carbonate to 109 of water, contained an abundance of aggregated masses, but whether generated by the action of the salt, I do not know. This piece was again placed in the solution, so that it was immersed altogether for 6 hrs. 15 m., and now there was a great change; for almost all the spherical masses within the gland-cells had disappeared, being replaced by <b>granular</b> <b>matter</b> of a darker brown. The experiment was thrice repeated with nearly the same result. On one occasion the piece was left immersed for 8 hrs. 30 m., and though almost all the spherical masses were changed into the brown <b>granular</b> <b>matter,</b> a few still remained. If the spherical masses of aggregated matter had been originally produced merely by some chemical or physical action, it seems strange that a somewhat longer immersion in the same solution should so completely alter their character. But as the masses which slowly and spontaneously changed their forms must have consisted of living protoplasm, there is nothing surprising in its being injured or killed, and its appearance wholly changed by long immersion in so strong a solution of the carbonate as that [page 350] employed. A solution of this strength paralyses all movement in Drosera, but does not kill the protoplasm; a still stronger solution prevents the protoplasm from aggregating into the ordinary full-sized globular masses, and these, though they do not disintegrate, become granular and opaque. In nearly the same manner, too hot water and certain solutions (for instance, of the salts of soda and potash) cause at first an imperfect kind of aggregation in the cells of Drosera; the little masses afterwards breaking up into granular or pulpy brown matter. All the foregoing experiments were made on flower-stems, but a piece of a leaf was immersed for 30 m. in a strong solution of the carbonate (one part to 109 of water), and little globular masses of matter appeared in all the glands, which before contained only limpid fluid.|$|E

Some leaves were left for 23 hrs. in a weak infusion of raw meat and in water, and the hairs were then compared, but they differed very little or not at all. In both cases the contents of the cells seemed rather more granular than they were before; but the granules did not exhibit any movement. Other leaves were left for 23 hrs. in a solution of one part of carbonate of ammonia to 218 of water, and here again the <b>granular</b> <b>matter</b> appeared to have increased [page 352] in amount; but one such mass retained exactly the same form as before after an interval of 5 hrs., so that it could hardly have consisted of living protoplasm.

60|$|Large {{leaves from}} an ivy plant growing {{on a wall}} were so tough {{that they could not}} be gnawed by worms, but after four days they were {{affected}} in a peculiar manner by the secretion poured out of their mouths. The upper surfaces of the leaves, over which the worms had crawled, as was shown by the dirt left on them, were marked in sinuous lines, by either a continuous or broken chain of whitish and often star-shaped dots, about 2 mm. in diameter. The appearance thus presented was curiously like that of a leaf, into which the larva of some minute insect had burrowed. But my son Francis, after making and examining sections, could nowhere find that the cell-walls had been broken down or that the epidermis had been penetrated. When the section passed through the whitish dots, the grains of chlorophyll were seen to be more or less discoloured, and some of the palisade and mesophyll cells contained nothing but broken down <b>granular</b> <b>matter.</b> These effects must be attributed to the transudation of the secretion through the epidermis into the cells.|$|E
60|$|Turning now to {{the action}} of organic substances, the glands on which bits of raw meat were placed became dark-coloured; and in 18 hrs. their {{contents}} were conspicuously aggregated. Several glands with bits of albumen and fibrin were darkened in between 2 hrs. and 3 hrs.; but in one case the purple colour was completely discharged. Some glands which had caught flies were compared with others close by; and though they did not differ much in colour, there was a marked difference in their state of aggregation. In some few instances, however, {{there was no such}} difference, and this appeared to be due to the insects having been caught long ago, so that the glands had recovered their pristine state. In one case, a group of the sessile colourless glands, to which a small fly adhered, presented a peculiar appearance; for they had become purple, owing to purple <b>granular</b> <b>matter</b> coating the cell-walls. I may here mention as a caution that, soon after some of my plants arrived in the spring from Portugal, the glands were not plainly acted on by bits of meat, or insects, or a solution of ammonia--a circumstance for which I cannot account.|$|E

40|$|Dynamics of {{marginal}} liquid foams Liquid foams are compact packings of gas {{bubbles in}} a surfactant solution. They {{belong to a}} broad class of disordered materials including colloidal <b>matter,</b> <b>granular</b> media or soft pastes that exhibit a jamming transition [1, 2]. Above a critical packing density (close to 2 / 3), bubbles are jammed in the packing so that foam behaves as an elastic solid. When the density is such that the bubbles are just in touch, the foam reaches a marginal state, of extreme fragility, where its mechanical properties become strongly non linear [3]. Under a strong enough applied load, the bubbles switch neighbours and the foam flows. Thus, at the local scale, the key-events of stationary flow are bubble rearrangements. At the macroscopic scale, the flow {{is characterized by a}} non-linear friction law, whose origin is not entirely understood [4]. Liquid foams have a strong impact on industrial applications.

These data provide an important reference for the discussion of anisotropy values of disordered structures that are typically of relevance in granular systems.

After 24 hrs. these slices were compared under a high power with others left in water for the same time; the latter contained so many fine granules of legumin that the slide was rendered muddy; whereas the slices which had been subjected to the secretion were much cleaner and more transparent, the granules of legumin apparently having been dissolved. A cabbage seed which had lain for two days on a leaf and had excited much acid secretion, was cut into slices, and these were {{compared with those of}} a seed which had been left for the same time in water. Those subjected to the secretion were of a paler colour; their coats presenting the greatest differences, for they were of a pale dirty tint instead of chestnut-brown.

60|$|The purple fluid or <b>granular</b> <b>matter</b> which {{fills the}} cells of the glands differs to a certain extent from that within {{the cells of}} the pedicels. For when a leaf is placed in hot water or in certain acids, the glands become quite white and opaque, whereas [page 8] {{the cells of the}} pedicels are {{rendered}} of a bright red, with the exception of those close beneath the glands. These latter cells lose their pale red tint; and the green matter which they, as well as the basal cells, contain, becomes of a brighter green. The petioles bear many multicellular hairs, some of which near the blade are surmounted, according to Nitschke, by a few rounded cells, which appear to be rudimentary glands. Both surfaces of the leaf, the pedicels of the tentacles, especially the lower sides of the outer ones, and the petioles, are studded with minute papillae (hairs or trichomes), having a conical basis, and bearing on their summits two, and occasionally three or even four, rounded cells, containing much protoplasm. These papillae are generally colourless, but sometimes include a little purple fluid. They vary in development, and graduate, as Nitschke* states, and as I repeatedly observed, into the long multicellular hairs. The latter, as well as the papillae, are probably rudiments of formerly existing tentacles.|$|E

After 8 hrs. almost all the oblong glands were brown and much more opaque than they were before; their primordial utricles were somewhat shrunk and contained a little aggregated <b>granular</b> <b>matter.</b> The spherical glands were still white, but their utricles were broken up into three or four small hyaline spheres, with an irregularly contracted mass {{in the middle of the}} basal part.

By the next morning, after 23 hrs. 30 m., they had all disappeared, and the glands were brown; their utricles now formed a globular shrunken mass in the middle. The utricles of the oblong glands had shrunk very little, but their contents were somewhat aggregated. Lastly, the summit of a bladder which had been previously irrigated for 21 hrs. with a solution of one part of sugar to 218 of water without being affected, was treated with the above mixed solution; and after 8 hrs. 30 m. all the glands became brown, with their primordial utricles slightly shrunk.|$|E

The present work investigated apoptosis in white and gray <b>matter</b> (<b>granular</b> layer) in the cerebellum of naturally infected dogs by the analysis of the expression of the pro-apoptotic antigens caspase - 2 and - 3, b(terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL-staining) positivity, annexin-V immunodetection, and the presence of the anti-apoptotic antigens, BCl- 2 and p 53. Cerebellum specimens were obtained from the Laboratory of Animal Pathology, from 1995 to 2009, and the 5 -μm thick fragments were stained both with hematoxylin-eosin and Shorr. All samples were diagnosed as positive for CDV genome by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction targeting the nucleocapsid gene. The anti-apoptotic pathways evidenced in this study were BCl- 2 and p 53 proteins that were intensively detected in cerebellum of CDV positive slides (40 - 80 % of labeled cells/mm 2). In addition, the apoptosis markers annexin-V and TUNEL are directly correlated among the same samples (80 and 40 % of labeled cells, respectively). This is the first description of p 53 and annexin-V expression, characterized as anti-apoptotic and apoptotic proteins, involvement in canine natural cases of CDV infections...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the development of}} a new software tool, called "Pomelo", for the calculation of Set Voronoi diagrams. Voronoi diagrams are a spatial partition of the space around the particles into separate Voronoi cells, e. g. applicable to granular materials. A generalization of the conventional Voronoi diagram for points or monodisperse spheres is the Set Voronoi diagram, also known as navigational map or tessellation by zone of influence. In this construction, a Set Voronoi cell contains the volume that is closer to the surface of one particle than to the surface of any other particle. This is required for aspherical or polydisperse systems. Pomelo is designed to be easy to use and as generic as possible. It directly supports common particle shapes and offers a generic mode, which allows to deal with any type of particles that can be described mathematically. Pomelo can create output in different standard formats, which allows direct visualization and further processing. Finally, we describe three applications of the Set Voronoi code in <b>granular</b> and soft <b>matter</b> physics, namely the problem of packings of ellipsoidal particles with varying degrees of particle-particle friction, mechanical stable packings of tetrahedra and a model for liquid crystal systems of particles with shapes reminiscent of pearsComment: 4 pages, 9 figures, Submitted to Powders and Grains 201...|$|R
