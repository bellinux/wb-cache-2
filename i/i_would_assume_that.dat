If pressed, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> it was piped {{into one of the}} many Victorian drains which take the runo from the moors safely away from the house. If pressed further <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have given that answer a high probability of being correct, using a process of elimination (where else could it go?). I now know that I was spectacularly wrong. A previous owner had piped this water directly into the septic tank; a practice which is both illegal and likely to cause problems as the tank is not designed to be swamped by excess water. (For the uninitiated, many old houses on the moors are not connected to a mains drainage network, so dirty water from the house is collected in a tank where the solids settle out, and then the grey water is treated in a soakaway.) We had to renew our soakaway and decided to replace it with a reed bed and living soakaway. The rainwater is now diverted into a new pond, which will undoubtedly be a topic of a future article. This puts me in mind of Donald Rumsfeld's comment at a press brie ng in 2002 when he was US Defense Secretary (since I disagree with so much that Rumsfeld did and stood for it pains me to use this quote, but it is a wonderful statement) : There are known knowns. There are things we know that we know. There are known unknowns. That is to say, there are things that we now know we don't know. But there are also unknown unknowns. There are things we do not know we don't know. To which <b>I</b> <b>would</b> add There are mistaken knowns. There are things we think we know, that we do not know.

40|$|<b>I</b> <b>would</b> like to {{warn the}} {{possible}} audience of these considerations {{about the fact that}} I shall be mainly dealing with some very specific shorter poems by Edmund Spenser (*London, circa 1552 - †Westminster, 1599), instead of quoting lavishly from his two longer works as it seems that contemporary readers of English Renaissance poetry appear to delight themselves in the sonnet collections and other shorter poems which thus would enable their readers to appreciate the spark of genius of their authors in very little time, though <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>assume</b> as well <b>that</b> they may also consider several of the great poetic achievements of the late Tudor period as rather cumbersome. Cumbersome because in most cases their frequent overwhelming extension hinders the possibility of reading them in just one quiet afternoon or in a dark and stormy night. Caveat emptor & co. Contemporary passion for saving time in any activity in order to devote it to some idle occupations, a passion that Elizabethans shared as well, is not the only reason responsible for the removing of these literary works to rather remote shelves of the present-day everyman’s library of poetic diction, reasonable poetry and sensible taste. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like to remark that there is a good number of 16 th and 17 th century poems that constitute quite an ordeal even for the most biased amateur of verse, as these are representative of a world that has been fully discarded by modern fashion and by poetic usage.

Yet {{it should be}} added that there are rules of good project management and design for preventing precisely this from happening. Everybody knows about scientific fraud and cases of lip service of experts, but nevertheless only few would assert that therefore the rules of scientific activity such as peer review or the Mertonian norms of science (communalism, universalism, disinterestedness, originality, skepticism) are ineffectual and that science is therefore an obscure undertaking. Yet just as little should the fact that manipulation of participatory procedures does occur lead anyone to draw {{the conclusion that the}} rules of good participatory practice (which ultimately are based on the principles of discourse ethics) are senseless and ineffectual. It is precisely this problem which shows how important the institutional setting of the responsible organization is. It makes a difference whether a ministry commissions a participation contractor or brings an institution into play that is committed to independence as shown by its mission statement. I would therefore like to recommend that studies on participatory TA distinguish between the shortcomings of project management and the structural limits or deficits of the participatory procedure itself.|$|E

40|$|Successfully {{leveraging}} {{social media}} {{is now an}} essential part of any commercial real estate job seeker’s strategy. A recent study conducted by Reppler 1, a social media consultancy, found that 91 % of employers are now using social media to screen prospective applicants. Cornell University’s Baker Program in Real Estate and SelectLeaders have closely monitored changing trends in the real estate search space. Marc Torrey, Director of Global Sales at SelectLeaders, states that, “Where we see social media playing the biggest role in recruiting is on the screening end of the process. If I were looking for a job today <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> a recruiter was going to do a search and check on my online presence, what I consider to be someone’s online personal brand. Taking the time to make sure that your online personal brand conveys who you are and represents your best self should be a vital step in any job seekers process. ” 2 The resume may still be the single most important piece of an applicant’s arsenal in the recruiting process, but social media is beginning to render resumes obsolete. Phil Greenberg, Associate Director of Real Estate Career Services at Cornell University’s School of Hotel Administration, observes, “Now, there are dedicated boards such as SelectLeaders, which are very industry specific. The number of job postings and boards has proliferated extensively, and the ability to connect with people who have commonalities has similarly increased. ” 3 David Pollard of Monster. com states, “The next batch of workers to enter the workforce will shine on social media. Ultimately, it’s where they’ll pick up a tip for their next job. And so, talent management has to revamp its thinking toward one in which the resume is a piece (albeit an important one) of the puzzle. ”...|$|E
40|$|I 2 ̆ 7 m {{going to}} speak about bird baits that are {{produced}} by the rodent-control fund. In my estimation, there are about six criteria for mixing good, high quality bait materials. The first one would be a toxicant. This {{is the first thing}} people talk or think about. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> you would select a toxicant that has the quality to do the intended job. The second point is the sticker. So our criteria for a sticker are as follows: good adhering qualities, good spreading qualities (by this I mean if you introduce the toxicant into a sticker as is often done-we don 2 ̆ 7 t do this—you must be able to disperse this material in either a suspension or in a solution so that you get an even distribution over the bait material), good sacking quality (that is, a material you can sack directly from the mixer or from whatever equipment you use; having to take a material out for instance in a production run and spreading it to dry just doesn 2 ̆ 7 t lend itself to any type of production), good storage qualities (it can 2 ̆ 7 t harden the material in the bag if you must store it {{for a long period of}} time, nor should it change any of the color, odor, or taste characteristics of the bait material), good lasting quality in the field (we wish a material to last more than past the first rain storm). The third point is mixing procedure. This of course depends on the type of equipment you have. But in general our practice is to dry mix the toxicant and bait materials together. A fourth point is housekeeping. I have seen an awful lot of bait material; and one of the things that is commonly done in the feed industry, or used to be, was that you didn 2 ̆ 7 t throw things away. If you could sweep it up and remix it into some other preparation, this was an acceptable practice. It is not an ac-ceptable practice in mixing quality bait materials. We also have another criteria we think of as bags. There are criteria for the type of bag. I am not at all pleased with a multi-wall paper bag. I know commercial industry has gone with this; but as Bemus has illustrated to me, you can take a multi-wall paper bag and drop it from your shoulder 25 times and you 2 ̆ 7 ve had it. You can take a burlap bag or a bag with 7 -ounce burlap in it, and drop it all day long from your shoulder, and still use the bag with no apparent effect from the jarring. Probably the most important thing in bait mixing, and if there is any secret to bait mixing, and I 2 ̆ 7 m a bug on this, it 2 ̆ 7 s selection of the bait material. I might say that we do not use materials of a quality less than human consumption. We do not consider number one corn good enough; it contains too much trash and other materials to be suitable for bait material...|$|E
