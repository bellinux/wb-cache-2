Hair length and style became a life-or-death matter in 1645 as the Manchu told them <b>either</b> <b>their</b> hair or their head would be cut.|$|E
5|$|The {{easiest way}} for the goalkeeper to block shots {{is for them to}} block the ball with <b>either</b> <b>their</b> hands or arms. Longer arms can help the goalkeeper to reach the ball, thus being an advantage.

5|$|Although Panther Central, the Towers Lobby which connects {{all three}} towers, and the dining {{services}} {{located on the}} ground floor are accessible to everyone, only residents are allowed in the individual towers and must present their student ID card to a 24-hour security guard to gain entrance. Visitors to any of the Towers must be signed in by a resident of the Tower, and must present <b>either</b> <b>their</b> student ID card if they are a student or a valid form of photographic identification if they are not. Guests signed in by residents must be signed out and leave the Tower by 2:00 AM. If not, an overnight stay request must be completed, of which a student can only file a certain number each academic semester. No resident is permitted to sign in more than three people at one time.|$|E

5|$|In early 902, Emir Ibrahim II {{was forced}} into abdication by his subjects, through the {{intervention}} of the Abbasid caliph. Ibrahim exchanged places with Abu'l-Abbas, who was named as his successor: Abu'l-Abbas left Sicily for Ifriqiya, while Ibrahim now resolved to take up the mantle of the Holy War, and accompanied a group of volunteers to Sicily in the summer. In an act that broke the long-standing stalemate on the island, Ibrahim and his followers advanced on Taormina, defeated the Byzantine garrison before its walls and laid siege to it. Left unsupported by the imperial government, the town fell on 1 August 902. Ibrahim then capitalized on his success by sending raiding parties against various strongholds in the vicinity, forcing <b>either</b> <b>their</b> capitulation and destruction or the payment of tribute.|$|E
5|$|In the African American {{section of}} the city, where most {{dwellings}} were built of discarded material, many homes were damaged. On one street, only two houses did not lose <b>either</b> <b>their</b> walls or roof. Walls and cars were cartwheeling down the streets. During the storm, about 100people ran to a trash incinerator, a concrete-reinforced building. A few of the local Black churches suffered significant damage. Tabernacle Missionary Baptist Church lost many bricks on its front facade {{and much of the}} metal grillwork around the entrances, while the building itself was deroofed. Payne Chapel AME Church, then located at Banyan Boulevard and Tamarind Avenue, was destroyed by the storm. St. Patrick's Catholic Church received about $40,000 in damage.|$|E
5|$|Metalloproteinase {{activity}} causes hemorrhage and necrosis {{following a}} snake bite, {{a process which}} aids digestion. The activity of proteases, on the other hand, disrupts platelet and muscle function and damages cell membranes, and thus contributes to a quick death for the prey animal. The {{study found that the}} venoms of Crotalus fell into two categories; those that favored metalloproteinases (Type I) and those that favored proteases (Type II). The study stated that these functions were essentially mutually exclusive; venoms had been selected for based on <b>either</b> <b>their</b> toxicity or their tenderizing potential. The researchers also hypothesized that the reason for this dichotomy was that a venom high in neurotoxicity, such as a type II venom, kills an animal quickly, preventing the relatively slower acting metalloproteinase from digesting tissue.|$|E

5|$|The Panthers {{have three}} main jersey colors: black, white, and blue. Their blue jerseys, {{designated}} their alternate uniforms, are the newest and {{were introduced in}} 2002. NFL regulations allow the team to use the blue jersey up to two times in any given season. In all other games, the team must wear <b>either</b> <b>their</b> white or black jerseys; in NFL games, the home team decides whether to wear a dark or white jersey, while the away team wears the opposite. The Panthers typically pair their white jerseys with white pants, while the black and blue jerseys are paired with silver pants; there have only been a few exceptions to these combinations.|$|E
5|$|The {{phylogeny}} of the teleosts {{has been}} subject to long debate, without consensus on <b>either</b> <b>their</b> phylogeny or {{the timing of the}} emergence of the major groups before the application of modern DNA-based cladistic analysis. Near et al. (2012) explored the phylogeny and divergence times of every major lineage, analysing the DNA sequences of 9 unlinked genes in 232 species. They obtained well-resolved phylogenies with strong support for the nodes (so, the pattern of branching shown is likely to be correct). They calibrated (set actual values for) branching times in this tree from 36 reliable measurements of absolute time from the fossil record. The teleosts are divided into the major clades shown on the cladogram, with dates, following Near et al.|$|E
5|$|The {{residential}} school system harmed Indigenous children significantly by removing {{them from their}} families, depriving them of their ancestral languages, exposing many of them to physical and sexual abuse, and forcibly enfranchising them. Disconnected from their families and culture and forced to speak English or French, students who attended the {{residential school}} system often graduated unable to fit into <b>either</b> <b>their</b> communities or Canadian society. It ultimately proved successful in disrupting the transmission of Indigenous practices and beliefs across generations. The legacy of the system {{has been linked to}} an increased prevalence of post-traumatic stress, alcoholism, substance abuse, and suicide, which persist within Indigenous communities.|$|E

5|$|After {{coming of}} age, the Avatar is sent by Garon to inspect a Hoshidan {{fortress}} above the Bottomless Canyon. However, one of Garon's men, Hans, provokes {{a battle with}} the Hoshidans and throws the Avatar's mentor Gunter into the Canyon. The Avatar is found and captured by Hoshidan soldiers, who recognize them as a long-lost member of the Hoshidan royal family. The Avatar is brought to meet their blood relatives and Azura at the capital city. However, soldiers attack the city and a hooded assassin attempts to kill the Avatar. Mikoto shields them {{at the cost of}} her life. In the aftermath, the Avatar comes into possession of a legendary sword called Yato, said to belong to the one who will save the world. In the opening battle between the two kingdoms, the Avatar's two families meet, and the Avatar is forced to choose between siding with Hoshido and Nohr. In the Birthright and Conquest routes, the Avatar chooses <b>either</b> <b>their</b> biological or adopted family, respectively. This causes them to be denounced by the other side, and they are gradually forced to fight them.|$|E
5|$|In June 2015, {{two members}} of the Security Committee of the Czech Parliament visited Uherský Brod and talked to {{multiple}} witnesses. The MPs issued a report condemning handling of the situation by the police. Among other issues, the MPs criticized that policemen parked their cars and put bullet proof vests on within the shooting range of the attacker, initially failed to get information from the witnesses and only later during the intervention attempted to contact them, didn't cover the back exit and thus potentially allowed the perpetrator {{to get out of the}} object and jeopardize other people. The police even let a helicopter land within the shooting range of the attacker. According to MPs, the police left much to be desired in regards of communication and most importantly, they wrongly decided to believe the perpetrator's claim of having hostage even though the witnesses could have readily confirmed that everyone inside was most likely dead. The policemen didn't seal the vicinity of the attack until 1pm and used civilian phones in communication with superior officers instead of using <b>either</b> <b>their</b> own phones or radio transmitters. Minister of Interior Chovanec commented that the MPs failed to interview the policemen and thus didn't get all the relevant information.|$|E
5|$|The {{recognised}} metalloids can {{be obtained}} by chemical reduction of <b>either</b> <b>their</b> oxides or their sulfides. Simpler or more complex extraction methods may be employed depending on the starting form and economic factors. Boron is routinely obtained by reducing the trioxide with magnesium: B2O3 + 3 Mg → 2 B + 3MgO; after secondary processing the resulting brown powder has a purity of up to 97%. Boron of higher purity (> 99%) is prepared by heating volatile boron compounds, such as BCl3 or BBr3, either in a hydrogen atmosphere (2 BX3 + 3 H2 → 2 B + 6 HX) or to the point of thermal decomposition. Silicon and germanium are obtained from their oxides by heating the oxide with carbon or hydrogen: SiO2 + C → Si + CO2; GeO2 + 2 H2 → Ge + 2 H2O. Arsenic is isolated from its pyrite (FeAsS) or arsenical pyrite (FeAs2) by heating; alternatively, it {{can be obtained}} from its oxide by reduction with carbon: 2 As2O3 + 3 C → 2 As + 3 CO2. Antimony is derived from its sulfide by reduction with iron: Sb2S3 → 2 Sb + 3 FeS. Tellurium is prepared from its oxide by dissolving it in aqueous NaOH, yielding tellurite, then by electrolytic reduction: TeO2 + 2 NaOH → Na2TeO3 + H2O; Na2TeO3 + H2O → Te + 2 NaOH + O2. Another option is reduction of the oxide by roasting with carbon: TeO2 + C → Te + CO2.|$|E
