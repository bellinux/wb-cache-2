500|$|Ben Sisario {{criticized the}} album in the Rolling Stone Album Guide, writing that [...] "the {{whole thing was}} some bland divine plan" [...] and asking, [...] "Is this man's final dis of God, or His of us?" [...] Some critics {{perceived}} the spiritual element of the storyline to be a joke or stunt. Allmusic writer Bradley Torreano wrote that [...] "Even {{if it is a}} joke, it isn't a funny one, or even a clever one." [...] In September 2003, Insane Clown Posse was voted the worst band of any musical genre <b>in</b> <b>Blender,</b> with The Wraith: Shangri-La named as the group's worst album. However, the magazine also gave the album a positive review for its [...] "charming, good-natured idiocy".|$|E

500|$|In 2005, Too Much Too Soon was remastered and reissued by Hip-O Select and Mercury, {{after which}} Christgau wrote <b>in</b> <b>Blender</b> that both it and New York Dolls make up [...] "a priceless proto-punk legacy". He wrote that {{although}} Johansen's best original songs {{are on the}} first record, Too Much Too Soon has consistent hooks, clever lyrics, and exceptional cover songs, including [...] "two R novelties whose theatrical potential was barely noticed until the Dolls penetrated their holy essence". That same year, rock journalist Toby Creswell named [...] "Babylon" [...] {{as one of the}} greatest songs of all time in his book 1001 Songs. In the Encyclopedia of Popular Music (2006), Colin Larkin felt the band's issues with alcohol and other drugs affected their performance on the record, which he deemed [...] "a charismatic collection of punk/glam-rock anthems, typically delivered with 'wasted' cool".|$|E
500|$|Among {{more recent}} commentators, Simon Leng {{considers}} [...] "Far East Man" [...] {{to be among}} Harrison's best compositions and [...] "one of its writer's most beguiling pieces", while AllMusic's Richard Ginell describes it as [...] "exquisite". Leng praises the [...] "especially attractive" [...] middle eight and views the track as [...] "a musical acceptance of life as an unfathomable riddle … a wistful shrug of the shoulders set to music". Ian Inglis identifies [...] "a lovely melodic passage" [...] in {{the first line of}} the choruses, which he regrets [...] "is never fully developed elsewhere", and compares the song favourably with Marvin Gaye's 1971 album What's Going On. In an April 2004 article <b>in</b> <b>Blender</b> magazine, Paul Du Noyer deemed [...] "Far East Man" [...] to be the [...] "standout track" [...] on an album that displayed an [...] "uncharacteristic spell of rock star excess" [...] on Harrison's part.|$|E
500|$|Erotica {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called it [...] "ambitious" [...] {{and noted that}} Erotica contains some of Madonna's best and most accomplished music. Paul Verna from Billboard considered it her most varied and creatively challenging collection to date. Arion Berger of Rolling Stone praised the album's [...] "cold, remote sound", and wrote that [...] "Erotica is everything Madonna has been denounced for being— meticulous, calculated, domineering and artificial. It accepts those charges and answers with a brilliant record to prove them". NME said: [...] "When Erotica the album is good– i.e. when it's funny, original, lively and, yes, sexy– it's {{about as good as}} the modern media event gets." [...] J. D. Considine of The Baltimore Sun stated that the most surprising thing on the songs is that they find Madonna singing about love, not about sex. Phil Sutcliffe gave three stars in a review for Q, writing: [...] "The biggest surprise is 'Deeper and Deeper', which could be mistaken for a bopalong tribute to Kylie. However, the substance of Erotica resides in a range of straight-talking, almost intimate songs based, not on an idea about sex, but on experience of relationships." [...] In a retrospective review <b>in</b> <b>Blender,</b> Tony Power concluded: [...] "That female artists (except Millie Jackson) never come on this strongly makes Erotica shocking and, well, arousing." ...|$|E

A retrospective review <b>in</b> <b>Blender</b> remarked: [...] "Her first 'headphones album'... It's more playful and less pompous than Ray of Light." [...] Rolling Stone stated that the album was a rough and improvised version of Ray of Light, but lauded that Madonna had chosen to make a more [...] "instinctive" [...] record than her previous endeavours. Mojo magazine said that [...] "Music is fitful and its charms aren't all immediate, but Madonna is still doing what she does best--giving a lick of pop genius to the unlikely genre of experimental dance music." [...] NME said that Music is [...] "vocodered, stretched, distorted, warped, deliberately upstaged by beats so showy they belong in a strip joint – quite simply, she's almost managed to make herself disappear. That bluntly explicit title isn't just pointless irony. This record is about the music, not Madonna; about the sounds, not the image." [...] Slant Magazine criticised Madonna's collaborations with William Orbit, {{who had worked with}} her on Ray of Light, calling them repetitive and uninteresting despite being catchy.
