High impact polystyrene (HIPS) is a heterogeneous polymer alloy produced by dissolving rubber in styrene and polymerizing the solution. The final product consists of rubber particles dispersed within a polystyrene matrix. For a HIPS resin, mechanical properties depend on the rubber particle morphology, rubber particle size, and adhesion to the polystyrene matrix. Previous studies have shown that these rubber phase properties are related to feed formulations, polymerization conditions, and process type. The current research provides data on the effect of polymerization conditions on rubber phase properties. Specifically, the effect of polymerization temperature, initiator concentration, chain transfer agent concentration, and polybutadiene rubber molecular weight on rubber particle size and morphology were examined in a 1250 ml laboratory continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR). Also, the effect of continuing polymerization and devolatilization, varying agitation, and using a preinversion CSTR on rubber particle size and morphology were examined in a 1 00 lb/hr pilot plant. Rubber particle size was shown to depend on the viscosity ratio of the polystyrene and rubber phases, interfacial tensions and shear rate. Rubber particle size is increased by: (1) increasing the viscosity ratio by increasing styrene molecular weight, and increasing CSTR conversion, decreasing poly rubber molecular weight, (2) increasing HIPS polymerization solution viscosity, (3) decreasing interfacial tension through grafting, and (4) increasing shear rate through agitator speed. Rubber efficiency was shown to depend on polystyrene occlusion size, rubber membrane thickness and the amount of <b>disintegrating</b> <b>particles.</b> Rubber efficiency is increased by: (1) increasing polystyrene occlusion size {{through the use of a}} preinversion reactor, (2) decreasing rubber membrane thickness through grafting and (3) decreasing the amount of <b>disintegrated</b> <b>particles</b> by preventing excessive grafting...|$|R
30|$|Our {{observations}} {{suggest that}} the likelihood that all three conditions are matched is very low: within the 35 min of analyzed videos, a total of 97 clast-clast collisions was counted outside the vent. This {{is a very small}} ratio, considering the fact that during that period thousands of ejecta were observed (including the 2, 479 particles that were attributed with straight flight paths). The collisions that were observed always resulted from a downward-falling particle colliding with upward moving (just ejected) clasts. Most of the observed cases were hits under very steep angles. In the rarer cases in which the ejecta of flatter angles were hit by downward-falling particles, the impact was characterized by the formation of a dust cloud, followed by a spreading cloud of quickly <b>disintegrating</b> <b>particles</b> that travelled along typical ballistic trajectories. Only in one case were conditions 2 (straight post-collision trajectories) and 3 (resulting angle larger than 62 ° to the vertical) matched.|$|R

Trajectories of snow particles were illuminated with a laser sheet cut with a rotary shutter and were recorded with a video camera system. Both average impact and ejection velocities increased with the friction velocity. However, average impact and ejection angles decreased. Standard deviations of the ejection angles were larger {{than those of the}} impact angles. Average horizontal components of both the impact and ejection velocities increased with the friction velocity, while average vertical components did not change much. In general, faster particles had smaller impact angles and slower particles had larger angles. The ratio of the average ejection velocity to the average impact velocity, that is the restitution coefficient, increased with the friction velocity. The vertical restitution coefficient ranged from 1. 5 to 2. 3,showing the increase of vertical ejection velocity at each impact. The results were discussed in comparison with those of previous studies including sand particles, and it was concluded that the overall characteristics of a loose snow surface at impact {{are similar to those of}} a sand surface in spite of different materials...|$|R

At proper fluences, NiSO 4 clusters were pulverized into nanoparticles. The sizes of clusters/nanoparticles {{were found to be}} dependent on laser fluence and laser pulse number. By increasing the laser fluence from 100 to 300 mJ/cm 2, the size of <b>disintegrated</b> <b>particles</b> decreased drastically from several micrometers to several nanometers. It was found that laser-induced disintegration of as-dispersed NiSO 4 clusters was mainly due to physical fragmentation by transient thermal expansion/ contraction. Thermal melting of nanoparticles in a multipulse regime was also suggested. Hot-filament chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD) was used for growth of CNTs from the pulsed-laser treated catalysts. For samples irradiated at 100 and 200 mJ/cm 2, CNFs were dominant products. These CNFs grew radially out of big NiSO 4 clusters, forming dendritic CNF bunches. For samples irradiated at 300 mJ/cm 2, dense multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNFs) with uniform diameters were obtained. It is suggested that elemental Ni was formed through thermal decomposition of NiSO 4 clusters/nanoparticles during HFCVD. The size and the shape of the Ni aggregation, which were determined by the initial size of NiSO 4 clusters/nanoparticles, might affect the preference in the synthesis of CNTs or CNFs...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} in Quantum Mechanics of non-local correlations {{is one of}} the two fundamentally non-intuitive features of that theory. The non-local correlations themselves fall into two classes: EPR and Geometrical. The non-local characteristics of the geometrical type are well-understood and are not suspected of possibly generating acausal features, such as faster-than-light propagation of information. This has especially become true since the emergence of a geometrical treatment for the relevant gauge theories, i. e. Fiber Bundle geometry, in which the quantum non-localities are seen to correspond to pure homotopy considerations. This aspect is reviewed in section 2. Contrary-wise, from its very conception, the EPR situation was felt to be paradoxical. It has been suggested that the non-local features of EPR might also derive from geometrical considerations, like all other non-local characteristics of QM. In[7], one of the authors was able to point out several plausibility arguments for this thesis, emphasizing in particular similarities between the non-local correlations provided by any gauge field theory and those required by the preservation of the quantum numbers of the original EPR state-vector, throughout its spatially-extended mode. The derivation was, however, somewhat incomplete, especially because of the apparent difference between, on the one hand, the closed spatial loops arising in the analysis of the geometrical non-localities, from Aharonov-Bohm and Berry phases to magnetic monopoles and instantons, and on the other hand, in the EPR case, the open line drawn by the positions of the two moving decay products of the <b>disintegrating</b> <b>particle.</b> In what follows, the authors endeavor to remove this obstacle and show that as in all other QM non-localities, EPR is somehow related to closed loops, almost involving homotopy considerations. They develop this view in section 3...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHypothesisZirconia microparticles {{produced}} by sol–gel synthesis have {{great potential for}} photonic applications. To this end, identifying synthetic methods that yield reproducible control over size uniformity is important. Phase transformations during thermal cycling can <b>disintegrate</b> the <b>particles.</b> Therefore, understanding the parameters driving these transformations is essential for enabling high-temperature applications. Particle morphology is expected to influence particle processability and stability. Yttria-doping should improve the thermal stability of the particles, {{as it does in}} bulk zirconia. ExperimentsZirconia and YSZ particles were synthesized by improved sol–gel approaches using fatty acid stabilizers. The particles were heated to 1500 °C, and structural and morphological changes were monitored by SEM, ex situ XRD and high-energy in situ XRD. FindingsZirconia particles (0. 4 – 4. 3 μm in diameter, 5 – 10 % standard deviation) synthesized according to the modified sol–gel approaches yielded significantly improved monodispersities. As-synthesized amorphous particles transformed to the tetragonal phase at ∼ 450 °C with a volume decrease of up to ∼ 75 % and then to monoclinic after heating from ∼ 650 to 850 °C. Submicron <b>particles</b> <b>disintegrated</b> at ∼ 850 °C and microparticles at ∼ 1200 °C due to grain growth. In situ XRD revealed that the transition from the amorphous to tetragonal phase was accompanied by relief in microstrain and the transition from tetragonal to monoclinic was correlated with the tetragonal grain size. Early crystallization and smaller initial grain sizes, which depend on the precursors used for particle synthesis, coincided with higher stability. Yttria-doping reduced grain growth, stabilized the tetragonal phase, and significantly improved the thermal stability of the particles...|$|R
40|$|Livestock {{houses are}} {{major sources of}} {{airborne}} particulate matter (PM), which can originate from manure, feed, feathers, skin and bedding and may contain and transport microorganisms. Improved knowledge of particle size, morphology, chemical and microbiological composition of PM in livestock houses can help identify major sources of PM {{and contribute to the}} development of appropriate source-specific reduction techniques. In rabbit production systems, however, there is limited information on specific particle characteristics. The objective of this study was to characterise airborne PM in rabbit farms in terms of morphology, chemical compositions and bacterial concentration in different size fractions. Size-fractioned PM was sampled in the air of 2 rabbit farms, 1 for fattening rabbits and 1 for reproductive does, using a virtual cascade impactor, which simultaneously collected total suspended PM (TSP), PM 10 and PM 2. 5 size fractions. Airborne PM samples were examined by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive X-ray analysis. Representative samples from potential sources of PM were also collected and examined. Additionally, a methodology to extract bacteria from the collected samples of airborne PM was developed to determine the bacterial concentration per PM size fraction. Results showed that airborne PM in rabbit farms is highly complex in particle morphology, especially in size. Broken skin flakes, <b>disintegrated</b> <b>particles</b> from feed or faecal material from mechanical fracture are the main sources of airborne PM in rabbit farms. Major elements found in rabbit airborne PM were S, Ca, Mg, Na and Cl.

40|$|The {{stability}} of protein microbubbles against addition of acid or surfactants was investigated. When these compounds were added, the microbubbles first released the encapsulated air. Subsequently, the protein shell completely <b>disintegrated</b> into nanometer-sized <b>particles.</b> The {{decrease in the}} number of intact microbubbles could be well described with the Weibull distribution. This distribution is based on two parameters, which suggests that two phenomena are responsible for the fracture of the microbubble shell. The microbubble shell is first weakened. Subsequently, the weakened protein shell fractures randomly. The probability of fracture turned out to be exponentially proportional to the concentration of acid and surfactant. A higher decay rate and a lower average breaking time were observed at higher acid or surfactant concentrations. For different surfactants, different decay rates were observed. The fact that the microbubble shell was ultimately <b>disintegrated</b> into nanometer-sized <b>particles</b> upon addition of acid or surfactants indicates that the interactions in the shell are non-covalent and most probably hydrophobic. After acid addition, the time at which the complete disintegration of the shell was observed coincided with the time of complete microbubble decay (release of air), while in the case of surfactant addition, there was a significant time gap between complete microbubble decay and complete shell disintegration...|$|R

40|$|Filled {{hydrogel}} particles {{consisting of}} emulsified oil droplets encapsulated within a hydrogel matrix were fabricated {{based on the}} phase separation of proteins and polysaccharides through aggregative and segregative mechanisms. A 3 % (wt/wt) pectin and 3 % (wt/wt) caseinate mixture at pH 7 separated into an upper pectin-rich phase and a lower casein-rich phase. Casein-coated lipid droplets added to this mixture partitioned into the lower casein-rich phase. When shear was applied, an oil-in-water-in-water (O/W 1 /W 2) emulsion consisting of oil droplets (O) contained within a casein-rich dispersed phase (W 1) suspended in a pectin-rich continuous phase (W 2) was formed. Acidification from pH 7 to 5 promoted adsorption of pectin onto casein-rich W 1 droplets, forming filled hydrogel particles. Particles were then cross-linked using transglutaminase. Particles were assessed for stability to changes in pH, increasing levels of salts (sodium chloride and calcium chloride), and susceptibility to lipid oxidation. Both cross-linked and not cross-linked particles were stable at low pH (pH 2 - 5). At high pH, cross-linked particles maintained their integrity while not cross-linked <b>particles</b> <b>disintegrated.</b> <b>Particles</b> were stable to sodium chloride (0 - 500 mM). Calcium chloride levels above 4 mM resulted in system gelation. The rate of lipid oxidation for 1 % (vol/vol) fish oil encapsulated within filled hydrogel particles was {{compared to that of}} oil-in-water emulsions stabilized by either Tween 20 or casein. Emulsions stabilized by Tween 20 oxidized faster than either filled hydrogel particles or casein stabilized emulsions, while filled hydrogel particles and casein stabilized emulsions showed similar oxidation rates.

Results showed similar rates of digestion for both hydrogel and emulsion samples. Attempts to fabricate particles using free oil (rather than emulsified oil) were unsuccessful and resulted in the formation of large non-encapsulated oil droplets (d ~ 10 μm). By controlling particle concentrations of biopolymer, water, and oil, it was possible to fabricate particles that were highly resistant to gravitational separation which was attributed to the equivalent density of the continuous and particle phases.

40|$|Electron {{microscopic}} {{study has}} revealed the morphological entity {{responsible for the}} rise in viral hemagglutinin observed in brains of mice after intracerebral inoculation of non-neurotropic strains of influenza virus. This rise in hemagglutinin, although dependent on inoculation of fully infectious virus, is not associated {{with an increase in}} infectious titer. The hemagglutinating principle is functionally similar to the "incomplete" influenza virus which can be obtained from chick embryos by serial egg-to-egg transfer of undiluted, infected allantoic fluid according to the method of von Magnus. A method has been described which facilitates selective adsorption of viral particles recovered from organ extracts on saponine-lysed ghosts of fowl erythrocytes. This procedure has been utilized in studying the morphology of non-infectious, hemagglutinating virus from chorio-allantoic membranes or mouse brains and in comparing these two forms {{with each other and with}} ordinary, infectious (standard) influenza virus. Standard virus isolated from allantoic fluids or membranes of infected eggs was found to contain uniform particles of predominantly spherical shape with smooth surface and even density, resembling those described by others. The appearance of such particles was not affected by the procedure of extraction and concentration used. In contrast, non-infectious, hemagglutinating virus obtained either from allantoic sacs ("undiluted passages") or from mouse brain was pleomorphic and seemed to consist of <b>disintegrating</b> <b>particles.</b> The majority appeared flattened and bag-like and had a rough, granular surface and reduced, uneven density. 37 per cent of the non-infectious particles isolated from mouse brain infected with the non-neurotropic strain WS had diameters in excess of 170 mµ, as compared with only 2 per cent of the particles of the parent strain itself. Regardless of whether or not the contrast in appearance of standard and of non-infectious particles was due to differing resistance to the preparatory treatment, it indicated the existence of basic structural differences between the two types of virus. Correlation of particle counts with hemagglutinin titers has shown that the non-infectious virus obtained from mouse brain is, unit for unit, an equivalent counterpart of standard virus derived from infected eggs. The end-point of hemagglutination in a pattern test corresponds for both forms to that dilution at which the ratio virus particles/red cells approaches one. The quantitative data based on particle counts support the assumption that non-infectious virus arises in mouse brain as a product of viral multiplication...|$|R

The transport of oxygen through the outer oxide layer appears to be rate controlling, in the case of NbAl 3 such transport is possible through Nb 2 O 5 in the scale {{and in the case of}} NiAl through other defects caused by insufficient supply of oxygen in the exposures...|$|R
40|$|Two {{kinds of}} neural {{networks}} {{which are not}} in common use were used to separate two kinds of events in nuclear experiments. The experiments were made using data simulated in SACLAY laboratory because the experiment ATLAS in CERN is still under construction. Because there are no direct criteria for separation of events, we use two kinds of neural nets for this task. The neural nets used have continuous output and separation - classication of events is made using a suitable threshold for the output value. It {{was found that the}} threshold must be carefully set and enrichment factor higher than 10 can be reached. 1 Problem formulation During the run of experiment the high energy protons collide in the Large Hadron Collider and are disintegrated and dierent decay processes arise. This is called an event. In the event most of particles under interest which arise in the decay processes usually have a very short life time (less than 10 10) and <b>disintegrate</b> until stable <b>particles,</b> especial [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|Because {{they possess}} a syrinx, Artamids, in {{particular}} the pied butcherbird, the pied currawong and the Australian magpie, are able to create subtle songs. Uniquely among other perching birds, some woodswallows possess special feathers called powder down. [...] The tips of the barbules on powder down feathers <b>disintegrate,</b> forming fine <b>particles</b> of keratin, which appear as a powder, or [...] "feather dust", among the feathers and spread when preening.The plumage of the Artamids is relatively dull, most birds showing a combination of greys, earthy browns, blacks and patches of white. There is seldom sexual dimorphism in plumage, but when it occurs the males are brighter and the females appear dull or resemble juveniles. In many species juveniles have a distinctly duller plumage.The notarium, a fused vertebra of the shoulder in birds that helps brace the chest against the forces generated by the wings, is a distinctive osteological trait that has evolved repeatedly in the passerines including the Artamadae family.|$|R
