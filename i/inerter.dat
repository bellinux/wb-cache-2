40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{dynamics}} {{and performance of}} inerter-based vibration isolators. Force / displacement transmissibility and vibration power flow are obtained to evaluate the isolation performance. Both force and motion excitations are considered. It is demonstrated {{that the use of}} <b>inerters</b> can enhance vibration isolation performance by enlarging the frequency band of effective vibration isolation. It is found that adding <b>inerters</b> can introduce anti-resonances in the frequency-response curves and in the curves of the force and displacement transmissibility such that vibration transmission can be suppressed at interested excitation frequencies. It is found that the introduction of <b>inerters</b> enhances inertial coupling and thus have a large influence on the dynamic behaviour at high frequencies. It is shown that force and displacement transmissibility increases with the excitation frequency and tends to an asymptotic value as the excitation frequency increases. In the high-frequency range, it was shown that adding <b>inerters</b> can result in a lower level of input power.

The conditions for each configuration to be strictly better than the simpler ones are obtained by presenting the analytical solutions of each configuration based on those of the simpler ones. Then, two stages of comparisons are given to show the performance limitations of suspension deflection for passive suspensions with <b>inerters.</b> In the first stage, it is shown that although the configurations with <b>inerters</b> can improve the mixed performance of ride comfort and tyre grip, the suspension deflection performance is significantly decreased simultaneously. In the second stage, it is shown that for passive suspensions with <b>inerters,</b> suspension deflection is the more basic limitation for both ride comfort and tyre grip performance by doing comparisons among mixed ride comfort and suspension deflection optimization, mixed ride comfort and tyre grip optimization, and mixed suspension deflection and tyre grip optimization. Finally, the problem of mixed ride comfort and tyre grip performance optimization with equal suspension deflection is investigated.

40|$|The {{possible}} {{benefits of}} employing <b>inerters</b> in automotive suspensions are explored for passenger comfort and handling. Different suspension strut designs {{in terms of}} the relative arrangement of springs, dampers and <b>inerters</b> have been considered and their performance compared with that of a conventional system. An alternate method of electrically realizing complex mechanical circuits by using a linear motor (or a rotary motor with an appropriate mechanism) and a shunt circuit is then proposed and evaluated for performance. However, the performance improvement is shown from simulations to be significant only for very stiff suspensions, unlike those in passenger vehicles. Hence, the concept is not taken up for prototyping. Variable damping can be implemented in suspension systems in various ways, for example, using magneto-rheological (MR) fluids, proportional valves, or variable shunt resistance with a linear electromagnetic motor. Hence for a generic variable damping system, a control algorithm is developed which can provide more comfort and better handling simultaneously compared to a passive system. After establishing through simulations that the proposed adaptive control algorithm can demonstrate a performance better than some controllers in prior-art, it is implemented on an actual vehicle (Cadillac STS) which is equipped with MR dampers and several sensors. In order to maintain the controller economical so that it is practically viable, an estimator is developed for variables which require expensive sensors to measure. The characteristic of the MR damper installed in the vehicle is obtained through tests as a 3 -dimensional map relating suspension speed, input current and damping force and then used as a look-up table in the controller. Experiments to compare the performance of different controllers are carried out on smooth and rough roads and over speed bumps. 1 yea...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a design methodology for {{the suspension system}} of a novel aerodynamically efficient motorcycle. Since the machines layout and the riders seating position are unconventional, several aspects of the machine design, including the suspension, must be reviewed afresh. The design process is based on matrix inequalities {{that are used to}} optimise a road-grip objective function - others could be used equally well. The design problem is cast as the minimisation of an H 2 cost with passivity constraints imposed on the suspension transference. The resulting bilinear matrix inequality problem is solved using a locally optimal iterative algorithm. The matrix inequality-type characterisation of positive real functions permits the optimisation of the suspension system over an entire class of passive admittances. Torsional springs, dampers and <b>inerters</b> are then used to construct networks corresponding to the optimal (positive real) admittances. Networks of first, second, third and fourth orders are considered, and an argument based on the compromise between complexity and improved grip is made for the most suitable suspension configuration. Finally, the effects of improved road grip on the stability of the vehicles lateral dynamics are analysed. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} a {{system based on}} passively controlled leading- and trailing-edge flaps {{that is designed to}} suppress wind-induced instabilities such as flutter and torsional divergence. The utility of the approach is demonstrated on a three-dimensional bridge model. Particular emphasis is placed on {{the early stages of the}} deck erection process when the bridge is particularly vulnerable to flutter. The flaps are activated by the deck's movements though passive phase-compensating mechanisms comprising of springs, dampers and <b>inerters.</b> It is demonstrated that optimised compensator parameters, and optimum hinge locations, result in a substantially improved deck aerodynamic performance. Particular importance is given to ensuring that the controlled system has good closed-loop ‘robustness’ properties, or in other words, that the controlled system has a high tolerance to parameter variations and uncertainties in the system dynamics. The practical use of a nonlinear optimisation algorithm with a FE bridge aeroelastic model, which includes the flap dynamics, necessitates the use of reduced-order models. A novel model reduction procedure that is based on the retention of dominant poles is introduced into the aeroelastic modelling framework. Multimodal interactions are observed at the various erection stages and conclusions are drawn with regard to the contributions of various modes of vibration to aeroelastic instabilities.

40|$|This study investigates {{different}} ways to passively suppress wind-induced instabilities such as flutter and torsional divergence. The control system design study {{is based on a}} sectional flexible bridge model interacting with a constant velocity airstream. Two different strategies are considered, separately and in combination. The first makes use of trailing and leading flaps adjacent to the bridge deck, the motion of which is triggered by the deck’s movement through a combination of springs, dampers and <b>inerters</b> at the hinged connection. Emphasis is placed on the effect of the flap hinge location and an optimization procedure is used for determining the compensator parameters that result in favorable aeroelastic properties. The second approach reexamines the efficacy and limitations of using Tuned Mass Dampers (TMDs) placed inside the bridge deck for controlling self-excited motion. We conclude by combining the two approaches and introducing a kinematic constraint between the masses of the TMD and the flaps. This combined mechanical system, referred to as the Flap Mass Damper (FMD), combines favorable aerodynamic properties of the flaps with a driving force provided by the vibrating mass. Consequently it has the advantage of not requiring complex and often impractical linkages in order to transmit the deck motion to the flaps. Special attention is given to ensuring that the passive control system attains optimum robustness properties and maximizes tolerance to uncertainties. Uncertainties are quantified in a series of simulations showing how the alteration of the bridge’s natural frequencies affect the stability of the controlled system. The Humber Bridge in the U.

40|$|SUMMARY: This paper proposes {{the use of}} a novel type {{of passive}} {{vibration}} control system to reduce vibrations in civil engineering structures subject to base excitation. The new system is based on the <b>inerter,</b> a device that was initially developed for high-performance suspensions in Formula 1 racing cars. The principal advantage of the <b>inerter</b> is that a high level of vibration isolation can be achieved with low amounts of added mass. This feature makes it an attractive potential alternative to traditional tuned mass dampers (TMDs). In this paper, the <b>inerter</b> system is modelled inside a multi-storey building and is located on braces between adjacent storeys. Numerical results show that an excellent level of vibration reduction is achieved, potentially offering improvement over TMDs. The inerter-based system is compared to a TMD system by using a range of base excitation inputs, including an earthquake signal, to demonstrate how the performance could potentially be improved by using an <b>inerter</b> instead of a TMD. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Inerter</b> is {{a recent}} element in {{suspension}} systems with the property that the generated force {{is proportional to the}} relative acceleration between its two terminals, which is similar to the way a spring reacts to relative displacement and a damper to relative velocity. This paper presents the analysis of a non-linear <b>inerter</b> working in parallel to passive spring and damper of a vehicle suspension to evaluate its effect on vehicle’s ride. The non-linear <b>inerter</b> was theoretically capable of switching between on and off states depending on whether or not the suspension deflection was beyond a specified free play. In the study, this behavior was represented mathematically as control law which depended on the relative displacement between the sprung and unsprung masses. A mathematical quarter vehicle model incorporating the non-linear <b>inerter</b> was simulated in MATLAB/Simulink to determine the vehicle responses due to road input in the form of step profile for different combinations of free play and inerter’s on-state proportionality constant called the inertance.
