5|$|Nigerian cuisine, like West African cuisine in general, {{is known}} for its {{richness}} and variety. Many different spices, herbs and flavourings are used in conjunction with palm oil or <b>groundnut</b> <b>oil</b> to create deeply flavoured sauces and soups often made very hot with chili peppers.

5|$|The former Eastern Region {{was once}} famed for {{producing}} half the world's total output of palm kernels. Since the Nigerian Civil War production has markedly declined {{largely because the}} plantations and processing equipment were either damaged or destroyed. The production of other important cash crops such as cocoa, groundnut and <b>groundnut</b> <b>oil,</b> rubber, cassava, cotton and cotton seed and timber tumbled {{after the civil war}} and the subsequent oil boom years. Consequently, the area called Enugu State as well as the rest of Nigeria, which was once a self-sufficient net exporter in agricultural produce, must import food.|$|E
5|$|The Thanjavur Marathas {{gained control}} during the later part of 18th century until its {{annexation}} by the British East India Company in 1799. It was constituted as a municipality during 1866 {{and was a}} part of the erstwhile Tanjore district. The town was the headquarters and the only town in Mannargudi taluk. The town emerged as one of the chief centres of inland trade in the district during the British rule. Rice, betel leaves, <b>groundnut,</b> <b>oil,</b> metal articles and clothes were the major exports. A Methodist mission was established in the town during the third decade of the 19th century. During 1944, Chinese copper coins were unearthed from Thaliketti village in the region, dated to Sui period (585 CE) to the end of Song period (1275 CE). The coins indicate a possible Buddhist influence in the region. Mannargudi continued to be part of Tanjore district until India's independence in 1947 and Thanjavur district until 1991 and subsequently a part of the newly formed Tiruvarur district.|$|E

40|$|The {{investigation}} was undertaken with an objective of analyzing the antioxiclant capacity of leafy vegetables (LV) and testing their efficacy on storage of heated oils. Four leafy vegetables viz., cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata), coriander leaves (Coriandrum sativum), hongone (Alternanthera sessilis), and spinach (Spinacia oleracea) were analyzed for antioxiclant activity by standard methods. The ethanol extracts of LV {{were added to}} refined sunflower and <b>groundnut</b> <b>oils</b> heated to frying temperature and stored for 4 weeks, analyzed for peroxide value that indicates the oxidative state of oils. The polyphenol content ranged from 5 mg in cabbage to 69. 5 mg in spinach. Reducing power of the leafy vegetables indicative of electron donating property for termination of free radical chain reactions followed the order-spinach < cabbage < coriander leaves < hongone leaves. LV exhibited good hydroxyl radical and DPPH scavenging activities. LV extracts conferred a protective effect on peroxide formation on storage of heated oils. LV are excellent antioxidants that are stable at high temperatures and can serve as substitutes for synthetic antioxidants. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|In Senegal, {{the poverty}} {{reduction}} strategy {{will take place}} in a context characterized by international trade liberalization in the agricultural sector, in general and the groundnut sector, in particular. This is the backdrop against which we have developed a micro-simulated multiple household computable general equilibrium such as proposed by Decaluwé et al. (1999 b). Four simulations have been made and their impacts assessed at the macroeconomic, sectoral and household levels. The first two simulations concerned tariff reforms, and the last two, the external shocks resulting from a change in export prices on the world market (<b>groundnuts</b> and <b>groundnut</b> <b>oils).</b> These simulations have been used to assess the impacts that the liberalization of the groundnut industry and the privatization of Société Nationale de Commercialisation des Oléagineux du Sénégal (SONACOS) provided for in the Framework Agreement, may have on households and to establish a link between these economic reforms, poverty and income ditribution. This model is very flexible because it allows, in particular, a change in the distribution of the target groups who had not been retained prior to the simulation exercise so that an ex post analysis of poverty and inequality to the modeling exercise could be carried out. computable general equilibrium model, micro-simulation, poverty analysis, income distribution, privatization...|$|R
