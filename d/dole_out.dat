500|$|Early in {{the nineteenth}} century, {{immigrants}} flooded into Peninsular Malaysia, colonising the Straits Settlements including the island city of Singapore. Migrants and natives held differing beliefs, but over time the boundaries between those belief systems blurred. Most of the population believed in spirits that inhabit the jungles, and in gods and devils that hover around, capable of benevolence and mischief. [...] Certain people claimed that they could communicate with these supernatural beings. [...] Through rituals in which they danced and chanted, these spirit mediumstang-kees and bomohsinvited the beings to possess their bodies and <b>dole</b> <b>out</b> wisdoms, blessings, and curses to their believers.

In addition {{to developing a}} separate mystery for each episode, the writers also had to provide clues {{that would lead to}} the murder's resolution in the season finale. The murder mystery plot was planned {{from the beginning of the}} season and the killer's identity remained the same throughout production. Thomas said that at the beginning of the season, [...] "I know the broad strokes, I know who did it, I know how it was done, I know the big arcs, but we're always filling in the details. Those are week to week. It's a week to week challenge in the writers room figuring out how much information we want to <b>dole</b> <b>out</b> to the audience." ...|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Jeff Jensen award {{the season}} a [...] "C", calling it [...] "a straight-up disappointment." [...] Calling the early episodes with Daredevil's {{face-off}} with the Punisher [...] "skimpy and sluggish from the get-go", Jensen also added {{that they were}} [...] "a flatline of inert drama, with long scenes of windy exposition or dull skulking interrupted by the occasional well-staged if ridiculously gory fight sequence." [...] Jensen added that [...] "hope for improvement" [...] came {{with the introduction of}} Elektra, and that the sixth episode should be a template {{for the rest of the}} season, which ultimately, he felt was [...] "stiff and silly." [...] Daniel D'Addario for Time was also disappointed with the season, saying, [...] "it’s hard not to feel that one is being taken for a long, and not particularly enjoyable, ride... Daredevil just wants to <b>dole</b> <b>out</b> fun doses of extreme gore on the path to an endpoint on a business plan. Any viewer committed to story is left searching in the dark." [...] Vulture's Abraham Riesman joined the criticism, calling the seven episodes reviewed [...] "a dour parade of one cliché after another, recycling themes, images, and rhetoric that audiences have seen countless times before." [...] Though he wouldn't call it [...] "", he felt that with all the other superhero content released in the same year, [...] "it feels woefully unnecessary." [...] However, he did praise Bernthal's performance, saying it was [...] "another excitingly sympathetic antagonist" [...] after D'Onofrio's [...] "standout performance" [...] as Fisk in the first season, but was [...] "nowhere near as fun". In contrast to the first season of Jessica Jones, which Riseman called Marvel's [...] "first attempt to depict sex in any kind of realistic way", he called the second season of Daredevil [...] "astoundingly un-sexy." ...|$|E

There they rescue Roran's betrothed, Katrina, who was being held prisoner, and kill one of the [...] Ra'zac. Saphira, Roran, and Katrina return to the Varden, while Eragon stays behind to kill the {{remaining}} Ra'zac and <b>dole</b> <b>out</b> a suitable punishment to Sloan, Katrina's father who was imprisoned in Helgrind. (Eragon was reluctant to kill him). While he is fighting the remaining Ra'zac, it mentions that Galbatorix has discovered the name of all names. Eragon doesn't understand, and ignores the Ra'zac after it pleads for mercy, and kills him. After consulting the elven Queen Islazadi, they come to an agreement on how to punish Sloan. Sloan is condemned to never meet his daughter again. Eragon arranges affairs so that Sloan will regain eyesight in the future, should he repent for his crimes. As Eragon travels back to the Varden, he confronts a hermit in the name Of Tenga(He is later revealed to be a teacher of the herbalist, Angela). Arya the elf had come in order to protect Eragon, as he traveled through the Empire. They have a conflict with a group of Soldiers, meet some spirits as they travel to the Varden. Arya reveals about her association with Faolin and crafts a boat made of grass, whilst Eragon sings a flower for her. Once they return to the Varden, Eragon discovers that Katrina is pregnant with Roran's child and a wedding is arranged, which Eragon is to conduct. Just before it begins, a small force of enchanted troops attack alongside Murtagh and his dragon, Thorn. The enchanted soldiers had spells cast by Galbatorix that couldn't allow them to feel pain. King Orrin, King of Surda, discovers a method to kill the soldiers, behead them. Elven spell-casters aid Eragon and Saphira and cause Murtagh and Thorn to flee back to the Empire, winning the battle. After the fight, Roran marries Katrina. The leader of the Varden, Nasuada, then orders Eragon to attend the election of the new dwarf king in the Beor Mountains. He leaves with much reluctance as Nasuada forced Saphira to remain in the Varden, {{in order to protect the}} Varden from Murtagh and Thorn. Eragon travels with Nar Garzhvog, Leader of the Urgals to Bergan Hold, ancestral home of the Durmigst Ingentium. They see a Shrrg, Nagra and an enormous bear, which Eragon regarded as a threat even for Saphira, on the way. After staying for a brief period in Bergan Hold, where he is shown the forest of stone, Eragon heads to Farthen Dur where the new dwarf king is to be elected. Once among the dwarves in Farthen Dur, Eragon is the target of a failed assassination, found to be the work of the dwarf clan Az Sweldn rak Anhûin, whom the dwarf Orik then forces into exile. Having earned the sympathies of the dwarves, Orik is elected the new king. Saphira arrives to Farthen Dur for Orik's coronation and reconstructs Isidar Mithrim, the star rose which was destroyed in the battle of Farthen Dur.|$|E

2500|$|A {{negative}} {{review by}} Michael Dale in Broadway World judged that the play {{suffers from a}} lack of focus and would be better served by focusing on either of the rape cases that brought McAlary notoriety or by deepening McAlary’s character. The review further commented that the supporting roles only serve [...] "to move the narrative along or to <b>dole</b> <b>out</b> information about the lucky one". Dale said that the casting of Hanks was sentimental rather than ideal and that even his best use of his everyman persona paled in comparison to the person he portrayed. Entertainment Weekly critic Lisa Schwarzbaum gave the play a C+ grade noting that it is [...] "a show rolling in good will and affection for the playwright", for the debut of Hanks, and for [...] "the real-life story" [...] of McAlary. She was disappointed, however, after two hours of [...] "a dull, stalled play about a not-particularly-noteworthy mug with a flair for self-promotion". A reviewer for Financial Times, writing about another piece, called Lucky Guy a [...] "mediocre show".|$|E
2500|$|The Game {{began as}} a spec screenplay, written by John Brancato and Michael Ferris in 1991. It was sold that year to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), who put the project in turnaround, where it {{was picked up by}} Propaganda Films. Director Jonathan Mostow was {{originally}} attached to the project with Kyle MacLachlan and Bridget Fonda cast in the lead roles. Principal photography was to start in February 1993 but in early 1992, the project was moved to PolyGram Filmed Entertainment. Mostow was no longer the director of the film but instead became an executive producer. Producer Steve Golin bought the script from MGM and gave it to David Fincher in the hopes that he would direct. Fincher liked the various plot twists but brought in Andrew Kevin Walker, who had worked with him on Seven, to make the character of Nicholas more cynical in nature. Fincher and Walker spent six weeks changing the tone and trying to make the story work. According to David Fincher, there were three primary influences on The Game. Michael Douglas' character was a [...] "fashionable, good-looking Scrooge, lured into a [...] situation with a steroid shot in the thigh from The Sting". He {{said in an interview that}} his film differs from others of that kind because [...] "movies usually make a pact with the audience that says: we're going to play it straight. What we show you is going to add up. But we don't do that. In that respect, it's about movies and how movies <b>dole</b> <b>out</b> information". Furthermore, Fincher has said that the film is about [...] "loss of control. The purpose of The Game is to take your greatest fear, put it this close to your face and say 'There, you're still alive. It's all right.'" [...] More revisions were made to the script, including removing a scene where Nicholas kills Christine and then commits suicide, because Fincher felt that this did not make sense. In 1996, Larry Gross and Walker were brought in to make further revisions to the script.|$|E
