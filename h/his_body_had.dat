5|$|George Ogilvy, 3rd Lord Banff, {{inherited}} the property when his father, the 2nd Lord Banff, died on 10 September 1668. He {{was murdered in}} 1713 and the castle destroyed by fire; <b>his</b> <b>body</b> <b>had</b> been concealed inside. Restoration work was once more undertaken.|$|E
5|$|Harold's {{body was}} {{identified}} {{the day after}} the battle, either through his armour or marks on his body. The English dead, who included some of Harold's brothers and his housecarls, were left on the battlefield. Gytha, Harold's mother, offered the victorious duke the weight of her son's body in gold for its custody, but her offer was refused. William ordered that Harold's body was to be thrown into the sea, but whether that took place is unclear. Waltham Abbey, which had been founded by Harold, later claimed that <b>his</b> <b>body</b> <b>had</b> been secretly buried there.|$|E
5|$|Nevill {{was found}} in the kitchen, dressed in pyjamas, lying over an {{overturned}} chair next to the fireplace, amid a scene suggestive of a struggle. He had been shot eight times, six times to the head and face, fired when the rifle was a few inches from his skin. The remaining shots to <b>his</b> <b>body</b> <b>had</b> occurred from at least two feet away. Based on where the empty cartridges were found—three in the kitchen and one on the stairs—the police concluded that he had been shot four times upstairs, but had managed to get downstairs where a struggle took place, and during which he was hit several times with the rifle and shot again, this time fatally.|$|E
50|$|He {{was buried}} in the Panthéon, though <b>his</b> <b>body</b> <b>has</b> since disappeared.|$|R

5|$|One story relates that Gytha, Harold's mother, {{offered the}} victorious duke {{the weight of}} her son's body in gold for its custody, but was refused. William ordered that Harold's body be thrown into the sea, but whether that took place is unclear. Another story relates that Harold was buried {{at the top of a}} cliff. Waltham Abbey, which had been founded by Harold, later claimed that <b>his</b> <b>body</b> <b>had</b> been {{secretly}} buried there. Other legends claimed that Harold did not die at Hastings, but escaped and became a hermit at Chester.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the fire was under control, the house was almost totally destroyed, leaving behind only the garage and some front stonework. The fire had spread rapidly, and {{although}} high winds contributed to the intensity, authorities deemed {{the speed with which}} the house had become fully involved suspicious enough to bring in arson investigators. The bodies of Tim and Kelly were not recovered until the following morning, when the house had cooled enough to permit safe searching. Kelly had perished in her bed, most likely of smoke inhalation. Tim's body was found on the ground floor, near the kitchen. Investigators at first assumed he had died trying to escape, but later determined that he had perished in or near his bedroom, most likely of smoke inhalation and heat, and that <b>his</b> <b>body</b> <b>had</b> fallen through burned flooring to where it was discovered.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} the battle, Harold's body was identified, either by his armour or marks on his body. The bodies of the English dead, who {{included}} some of Harold's brothers and his housecarls, were left on the battlefield, although some were removed by relatives later. Gytha, Harold's mother, offered the victorious duke {{the weight of her}} son's body in gold for its custody, but her offer was refused. William ordered that Harold's body be thrown into the sea, but whether that took place is unclear. Another story relates that Harold was buried {{at the top of a}} cliff.

5|$|Following Ohayō, Kon {{began work}} on his next film, Dreaming Machine. In May 2010, Kon was {{diagnosed}} with terminal pancreatic cancer. Given half a year to live, Kon chose to spend {{the remainder of his}} life in his home. Shortly before his death Kon composed a final message, which was uploaded to his blog by his family upon his death. As Kon explained in the message, he chose not to make news of his rapidly advancing illness public, in part out of embarrassment at how drastically emaciated and ravaged <b>his</b> <b>body</b> <b>had</b> become. The result was that the announcement of his death was met with widespread shock and surprise, particularly given that Kon had shown no signs of illness at relatively recent public events, as the cancer progressed to a terminal state {{in a matter of months}} after being diagnosed. Kon died on August 24, 2010 at the age of 46. After his death, Kon was mentioned among the Fond Farewells in TIME's people of the year 2010. Darren Aronofsky wrote a eulogy to him, which was printed in , a Japanese retrospective book of his animation career.|$|E
5|$|The {{dramatic}} {{contrast between}} Ranavalona's isolationism and her son's pro-European stance represented an abrupt reversal of policy that threatened the traditional sociopolitical order. Radama's absolutism in pursuing dramatic reforms in disregard {{of the advice}} of his ministers ultimately turned them against him. In a coup led by his Prime Minister, Rainivoninahitriniony, Radama II was strangled on May 12, 1863. His wife Rabodo, who took the throne name Rasoherina, was allowed by the ministers to succeed her husband on the condition that she and future sovereigns would no longer rule unilaterally, but rather in concert with the Hova (the class of free citizens) as represented by the position of Prime Minister. The public was informed that Radama had committed suicide and that <b>his</b> <b>body</b> <b>had</b> been unceremoniously interred in a tomb in Ilafy. However, there soon emerged rumors – believed by prominent foreigners Jean Laborde and William Ellis – that Radama lived and was making plans to reclaim the throne. A strong case has since been {{made on the basis of}} significant evidence that Radama may indeed have revived after the strangling and lived to old age in anonymity near Lake Kinkony in the northwestern part of the island.|$|E

25|$|His {{funeral was}} held on 13 August 1913 at St Peter's Church in Tadley in Hampshire. Large crowds attended, drawn there because of the tragic {{circumstances}} of his death. <b>His</b> <b>body</b> <b>had</b> been cremated, an unusual choice at that time, but perhaps resulting form the horrific injuries <b>his</b> <b>body</b> <b>had</b> received during the flying accident. The casket containing his ashes was buried in a grave beside that of his grandmother, Emma Evans, {{who had died in}} 1911. Leon King, Cody's stepson, was among the mourners, as were Evan's family and friends. The prayers of committal were read by the Rev L.P. Phelps, from Oriel College, Oxford, which Evans had left only 8 years before.|$|E
25|$|What exactly {{happened}} that night is disputed. The government claimed that former president Robert Guéï led a coup attempt, and state TV showed pictures of his dead body in the street; counter-claims stated that he and 15 others had been murdered at his home, and <b>his</b> <b>body</b> <b>had</b> been moved {{to the streets to}} incriminate him. Alassane Ouattara took refuge in the German embassy; his home had been burned down.|$|E
25|$|Boris Yeltsin died of {{congestive}} heart failure on 23 April 2007, aged 76. According to experts quoted by Komsomolskaya Pravda, the onset of Yeltsin's condition was due to his visit to Jordan between 25 March and 2 April. He was buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery on 25 April 2007, following a period during which <b>his</b> <b>body</b> <b>had</b> lain in repose in the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow.|$|E

25|$|On August 28, 2013, Lee Seok-ki {{allegedly}} took a {{taxi and}} ran away in disguise when he found the investigators searching and seizing his place, {{according to the report}} of Channel A, a South Korean TV network. On the next day Lee explained he stayed in Seoul. Owing to his running away the execution of the search warrant on <b>his</b> <b>body</b> <b>had</b> to be delayed until the next day.|$|E
25|$|With {{the cave}} {{thoroughly}} searched, some divers began questioning whether Ben {{was there at}} all. Perhaps <b>his</b> <b>body</b> <b>had</b> been secretly removed from the cave before searching began and disposed of on land or it had washed out through the spring's outlet. Others, including Cronin and Kelly, suggested he had staged his own disappearance to start his life over under another identity and escape his past troubles. Authorities began to consider these possibilities and adjust their search.|$|E
25|$|Diogenes Laërtius {{records the}} legend that Empedocles died by {{throwing}} himself into Mount Etna in Sicily, {{so that the}} people would believe <b>his</b> <b>body</b> <b>had</b> vanished and he had turned into an immortal god; the volcano, however, threw back one of his bronze sandals, revealing the deceit. Another legend maintains that he threw himself into the volcano to prove to his disciples that he was immortal; he believed {{he would come back}} as a god after being consumed by the fire. Horace also refers the death of Empedocles in his work Ars Poetica and admits poets the right to destroy themselves.|$|E

25|$|The second {{explosion}} killed twelve soldiers: ten {{from the}} Parachute Regiment {{and the two}} from the Queen's Own Highlanders. Mike Jackson, then a major in the Parachute Regiment, was at the scene soon after the second explosion and later described seeing body parts scattered over the road, {{in the water and}} hanging from the trees. He was asked to identify the face of his friend, Major Peter Fursman, still recognisable after it had been completely ripped from his head by the explosion and recovered from the water by divers from the Royal Engineers. Only one of Colonel Blair's epaulettes remained to identify him as <b>his</b> <b>body</b> <b>had</b> been vaporised in the blast.|$|E
25|$|After a {{reign of}} thirty-seven years, Romulus {{is said to}} have {{disappeared}} in a whirlwind during a sudden and violent storm, as he was reviewing his troops on the Campus Martius. There were rumours that he had been murdered by the nobles, and that <b>his</b> <b>body</b> <b>had</b> been secretly dismembered and buried by them on their estates. However, a certain Proculus Julius claimed to have seen him ascending to the heavens as a god. Romulus acquired a cult following, which later became assimilated with the cult of Quirinus, perhaps originally the indigenous god of the Sabine population. As the Sabines had not had a king of their own since the death of Titus Tatius, the next king, Numa Pompilius, was chosen from among the Sabines.|$|E
25|$|Fourteen {{people were}} killed: Smith, the two others aboard the bomber (Staff Sergeant Christopher Domitrovich and Albert Perna, a Navy {{aviation}} machinist's friend hitching a ride), and eleven {{others in the}} building. Smith was not found until two days later, when search crews discovered that <b>his</b> <b>body</b> <b>had</b> gone through an elevator shaft and fallen to the bottom. Elevator operator Betty Lou Oliver was injured. Rescuers decided to transport her on an elevator {{that they did not}} know had weakened cables. The cables snapped and the elevator fell 75 stories, ending up in the basements. Oliver managed to survive the fall and rescuers later found her amongst the rubble. It still stands as the Guinness World Record for the longest survived elevator fall.|$|E
