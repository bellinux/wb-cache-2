5|$|Einstein's {{equations}} are {{the centerpiece}} of general relativity. They provide a precise formulation {{of the relationship between}} spacetime geometry and the properties of matter, using the language of mathematics. More concretely, they are formulated using the concepts of Riemannian geometry, in which the geometric properties of a space (or a spacetime) are described by a quantity called a metric. The metric encodes the <b>information</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> compute the fundamental geometric notions of distance and angle in a curved space (or spacetime).|$|E
5|$|In January 2011, the closely {{orbiting}} planet Kepler-10b {{was confirmed}} in {{the orbit of}} the star Kepler-10 after measurements of its transiting behavior (where it crosses in front of Kepler-10, periodically dimming it) and a radial velocity effect detected in Kepler-10's spectrum provided the <b>information</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> prove that it was indeed a planet. An additional, longer-period dimming was detected in Kepler-10's spectrum, suggesting that a second planet existed in the system; however, there remained the possibility that this signal could have some other cause, and that the transit event was a false positive. Attempts to measure the radial velocity effects of this object, now named KOI 072.02, were fruitless; therefore, to rule out false positive scenarios, the Kepler team used a technique called Blender.|$|E

5|$|In late 2006, the Jamul Indian tribe {{prepared}} {{to construct a}} casino, but many expressed concerns {{about the amount of}} traffic that would now travel on SR 94. In 2007, Caltrans declared that the construction required a permit to connect to SR94 and to construct on the state right-of-way. At the end of the year, the tribe had started construction on the driveway to the casino, while Caltrans stated that it lacked the <b>information</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> determine if the proposed traffic signal should be approved. In late 2009, the tribe filed a lawsuit against Caltrans over the inability to get approval to connect the driveway with the highway. The tribe made the claim that they were a sovereign nation and did not need the approval, but this was rejected by the court. Caltrans and the tribe came to an agreement in 2009, where the tribe would provide its own studies and pay for environmental mitigation.|$|E
5|$|The RNA genome {{consists}} {{of at least}} seven structural landmarks (LTR, TAR, RRE, PE, SLIP, CRS, and INS), and nine genes (gag, pol, and env, tat, rev, nef, vif, vpr, vpu, and sometimes a tenth tev, which is a fusion of tat env and rev), encoding 19 proteins. Three of these genes, gag, pol, and env, contain <b>information</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> make the structural proteins for new virus particles. For example, env codes for a protein called gp160 that is cut in two by a cellular protease to form gp120 and gp41. The six remaining genes, tat, rev, nef, vif, vpr, and vpu (or vpx {{in the case of}} HIV-2), are regulatory genes for proteins that control the ability of HIV to infect cells, produce new copies of virus (replicate), or cause disease.|$|E

25|$|But more {{important}} to the operation of the ODBC system is the DM's concept of a Data Source Name (DSN). DSNs collect additional <b>information</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> connect to a specific data source, versus the DBMS itself. For instance, the same MySQL driver can be used to connect to any MySQL server, but the connection information to connect to a local private server is different from the <b>information</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> connect to an internet-hosted public server. The DSN stores this information in a standardized format, and the DM provides this to the driver during connection requests. The DM also includes functionality to present a list of DSNs using human readable names, and to select them at run-time to connect to different resources.|$|E

For instance, the genome of a negative-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA -) virus may be template for a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA +). This is because the positive-sense strand contains the <b>information</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> translate the viral proteins for viral replication afterwards.

25|$|The {{extent to}} which the constraint-free MEG inverse problem is ill-posed cannot be overemphasized.

Furthermore, even when a unique inversion is possible in the presence of such constraints said inversion can be unstable. These conclusions are easily deduced from published works.|$|E

Also, if the compression utility's device driver was uninstalled or became corrupted, all data on the disk would be lost.|$|R

25|$|In {{the modern}} {{microscopic}} interpretation of entropy in statistical mechanics, entropy {{is the amount}} of additional <b>information</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> specify the exact physical state of a system, given its thermodynamic specification. Understanding the role of thermodynamic entropy in various processes requires an understanding of how and why that information changes as the system evolves from its initial to its final state. It is often said that entropy is an expression of the disorder, or randomness of a system, or of our lack of information about it. The second law is now often seen as an expression of the fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics through the modern definition of entropy.|$|E
25|$|Project {{entrepreneurs}} are exposed repeatedly to problems and tasks {{typical of the}} entrepreneurial process. Indeed, project-entrepreneurs face two critical challenges that invariably characterize {{the creation of a}} new venture: locating the right opportunity to launch the project venture and assembling the most appropriate team to exploit that opportunity effectively. Resolving the first challenge requires project-entrepreneurs to access an extensive range of <b>information</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> seize new investment opportunities. Resolving the second challenge requires assembling a collaborative team that has to fit well with the particular challenges of the project, and has to function almost immediately to reduce the risk that performance might be adversely affected.|$|E
25|$|The missing <b>information</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> {{help explain}} how new {{features}} could pass from {{a parent to}} its offspring {{was provided by the}} pioneering genetics work of Gregor Mendel. Mendel’s experiments with several generations of pea plants demonstrated that inheritance works by separating and reshuffling hereditary information during the formation of sex cells and recombining that information during fertilisation. This is like mixing different hands of playing cards, with an organism getting a random mix of half of the cards from one parent, and half of the cards from the other. Mendel called the information factors; however, they later became known as genes. Genes are the basic units of heredity in living organisms. They contain the information that directs the physical development and behavior of organisms.|$|E
