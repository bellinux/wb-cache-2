40|$|AbstractThe {{day after}} the independence, Algeria has faced the {{problems}} of underdevelopment and consequently the choice of model economic and social development.

In fact, the Membrun dam (16 m high) in the Durolle a kilometer from the city's first buildings represents a risk to the population below it. At the beginning of the city, the Muratte dam represents no risk to the municipality given its distance with it. <b>Industrial</b> <b>risk</b> is present in the city, even if no disasters are identify.

This could occur through natural mutation in the genes altered by random mutagenesis, {{or in the case of}} a deletion mutation, mating with an invasive WT strain. This could lead to a strain with TAG productivity characteristics similar to the WT dominating the outdoor raceway pond, hence, reducing overall TAG productivity. Moreover, raceway contamination through invasion by a local microalgal species, with lower TAG accumulation levels, is also an <b>industrial</b> <b>risk.</b>|$|E

3000|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the growth rates of a C. reinhardtii WT and mutant strain in monocultures and in {{competition}} (co-cultures) to evaluate the risk of the mutant strain escaping into the environment, as well as the <b>industrial</b> <b>risk</b> of losing the desirable phenotype of the mutant. The response surface design applied suggests relatively little environmental risk if the mutant escapes the cultivation vessel, but a potentially significant industrial productivity loss if a WT equivalent is introduced. Ultimately, the experimental approach is suggested as a predictor of environmental and <b>industrial</b> <b>risk</b> as the experiments were based on laboratory tests only and under specific conditions. A more comprehensive study of environmental risks would require incorporating the complexities associated with ecosystems, including increased biodiversity and changing environmental conditions.|$|E

More precisely, to what extent the presence of components in the industrial landscape may influence this risk perception. Several complementary methods were combined to evaluate risk perception, assess surrounding landscapes or measure the distance to landscape components. Qualitative, quantitative, and spatial data were collected, pooled and treated in a geographic information system in order to arrive at two main results. First, risk sensitivity depends on various factors including the landscape dimension and the visibility of industrial components. Second, mental maps drawn by people allow a better understanding of <b>industrial</b> <b>risk</b> sensitivity; it appears that areas of risk are more precisely delineated by people who are less worried about risk...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Building {{contracts}} {{are no different}} from any other contract, and merely formalise a series of promises in relation to the sharing of risk. The concept of risk underlies the nature of all relations in the building industry and determines the form and conduct of the parties in those relations. In particular the way in which <b>industrial</b> relations <b>risk</b> is allocated within the contract directly affects the various responses that building contractors make in terms of the management of their industrial relations. What are the contractual conditions concerning <b>industrial</b> relations <b>risk</b> in the building industry? How do the standard provisions allocate <b>industrial</b> relations <b>risk</b> and what are the key variables in this process that impact upon the day-to-day functioning of industrial relations practices...|$|R

30|$|To further this objective, the {{competitive}} outcome between cultivating two C. reinhardtii strains, the CC- 124 strain (hereon {{referred to as}} WT strain) and the starchless CC- 4333 strain (Zabawinski et al. 2001), (hereon referred to as mutant strain) was explored. An initial monoculture assessment of growth was undertaken followed by competing the strains against each other. A response surface competition experiment was developed, varying both the initial proportion of the WT and mutant strains, together with the nitrogen (ammonium chloride, NH 4 Cl) concentration in the media. An assessment of both environmental risk during an âescape scenarioâ and the <b>industrial</b> <b>risk</b> associated with being potentially out competed by the WT strain was made using this design. Subsequently, the <b>industrial</b> <b>risk</b> was further analysed by assessing total biomass accumulation and TAG productivity, again in response to varying the initial proportion of the strains and NH 4 Cl concentration.|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Industrial</b> <b>risk</b> {{management}} plays {{a central}} role in creating supportive environments for health. This paper examines the communityâs trust in citizensâ involvement in risk management, investigating differences among settings exposed to different levels of <b>industrial</b> <b>risk.</b> Additionally it aims to identify the social demographic characteristics of those manifesting high trust in citizensâ involvement in risk management. Methods: The survey, performed in Sardinia between 2006 and 2007, was carried out in three representative areas this Region: a metropolitan area, an industrial area, and a rural area.

40|$|The OSIRIS project {{addresses}} the disaster management workflow in the phases of risk monitoring and crisis management. Risk monitoring allows the continuous observation of endangered areas combined with sensor deployment strategies.

These demonstrations include water contamination, air pollution, south European forest fire, and <b>industrial</b> <b>risk</b> monitoring. This paper focuses on the latter scenario: the <b>industrial</b> <b>risk</b> monitoring. This scenario offers the special opportunity to demonstrate the relevance of OSIRIS by covering all the aspects of monitoring, preparation and response phases of both environmental risk and crisis management. The approach focuses on non-restrictive linking in a wireless sensor network {{in order to facilitate}} the addition and removal of nodes providing open interaction primitives allowing the comfortable integration, exclusion, and modification.

Conclusions: A consistent number of the communityâs members would entrust citizens with risk management not only in areas with a severe industrial impact, but also in those areas where <b>industrial</b> <b>risk</b> is considered of limited entity. The communityâs tendency towards citizensâ involvement in risk management appears to be an intrinsic trait of the community itself rather than an attitude triggered by a specific problem. Older women, and adults with higher education can be recognised as categories in which potential early adopters of risk management can be easily found. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe new French law nâ¦ 2003 - 699 of 30 th July 2003 has {{strongly}} {{changed the}} way industrial risks are managed and qualified, proposing a new tool, "Technological Risk Prevention Plans" (TRPP, in French Plans de PrÃ©vention des Risques Technologiques) for Land Use Planning (LUP). This new tool considers <b>industrial</b> <b>risk</b> as a combination between a "Hazard" and "vulnerable stakes". Thus, risk analysis has moved from a "hazard oriented" approach (probability, intensity, kinetic) to a "hazard and vulnerability" approach, insisting on the socio-spatial and economic dimensions of risk.

In the following paper, the authors will present (i) the changes in <b>industrial</b> <b>risk</b> analysis induced by the law's "new" definition of risk; (ii) the context stakes and vulnerabilities assessment in TRPP process; (iii) the territorial approach develop at INERIS and GEOSYSCOM research Laboratory.

40|$|The [french] {{ecologist}} electorate and <b>industrial</b> <b>risks.</b> Philippe Bonnetain, Daniel Boy. Political ecology {{has been}} present in France {{in the electoral}} field, with varying success, for about twenty years. A statistical and geographical analysis of its electoral results shows {{that there has been}} for a long time a relatively stable ecologist electoral structure. What is the significance of this structuring of a political phenomenon outside traditional politics ? While it is true that voters vote for ecology to promote policies of environmental defense, one could expect the frequency of such votes to be higher in areas where the environment is objectively threatened more than elsewhere. To verify this hypothesis, the ecologist vote is related statistically to objective indicators {{of the state of the}} environment in the various departments (pollution rate, intensity of <b>industrial</b> <b>risks,</b> etc.). The statistical analysis shows that in fact the expected relation is absent, and that votes for ecology are linked only to political factors (tapping a fraction of the Socialist Party's electorate) and to economic factors (a low unemployment rate).
