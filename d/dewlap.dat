5|$|Their coat differs geographically, with elands {{in north}} Africa having {{distinctive}} markings (torso stripes, markings on legs, dark garters and a spinal crest) that are absent in the south. Apart from a rough mane, the coat is smooth. Females have a tan coat, while the coats of males are darker, with a bluish-grey tinge. Bulls {{may also have}} a series of vertical white stripes on their sides (mainly in parts of the Karoo in South Africa). As males age, their coat becomes more grey. Males also have dense fur on their foreheads and a large <b>dewlap</b> on their throats.|$|E
25|$|Coat colour {{is white}} {{with a black}} mantle and black markings, {{including}} black or blue ticking on the body and tan ticking on the lower legs. Frequently a tan marking is found {{on the base of}} the upper thigh, which is called the 'roe buck mark'. Faults are listed as deviations in appearance or structure that {{have an effect on the}} health and working ability of the dog, as well as the appearance, and indicate that the dog with such faults should not be bred. Some of the faults listed are aggression or shyness, lack of pigmentation, off-colour, excessive <b>dewlap,</b> and frail limbs.|$|E
25|$|Gaur, {{also known}} as the Indian bison, is the {{heaviest}} and most powerful of all wild cattle native to South and Southeast Asia. It is indicated in field data that the population of mature animals is about 5,200–18,000. Male and female Gaur both have distinctive humps between the head and shoulders, a dorsal ridge, prominent horns, and a <b>dewlap</b> which extends to the front legs.The Gaur grows 60% faster than domestic cattle, meaning farmers meat can be harvested at a faster rate, making beef production two to three times more profitable. Gaur meat is preferred over other breeds' meat among local people. Another benefit of the bovine is that it has the ability to sweat and tolerates heat well.|$|E

25|$|The first {{written report}} of {{rinderpest}} inoculation {{was published in}} a letter signed 'T.S.' in the November 1754 issue of The Gentleman's Magazine, a widely read journal which also supported the progress of smallpox inoculation. This letter reported that a Mr Dobsen had inoculated his cattle and had thus preserved 9 out of 10 of them, although this was retracted in the next issue, as it was apparently a Sir William St. Quintin who had done the inoculating (this was done by placing bits of material previously dipped in morbid discharge into an incision made in the <b>dewlap</b> of the animal). These letters encouraged further application of inoculation {{in the fight against}} diseases. The first inoculation against measles was made three years after their publication.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a dispute}} among {{biologists}} {{as to how}} to properly classify the various species of zebra. It is thought that the plains zebra and mountain zebra belong to the subgenus Hippotigris and that Grévy's zebra is the sole species of subgenus Dolichohippus. This is on account of Grévy's zebra resembling an ass (subgenus Asinus), while the plains zebra and mountain zebra are more horse-like. All three animals belong to the genus Equus along with other living equids. However, recent phylogenetic evidence finds that plains zebras are more closely related to Grévy's zebras than mountain zebras. In areas where plains zebras are sympatric with Grévy's zebras, it is not unusual to find them in the same herds and fertile hybrids occur. In captivity, plains zebras have been crossed with mountain zebras. The hybrid foals lacked a <b>dewlap</b> and resembled the plains zebra apart from their larger ears and their hindquarters pattern.|$|E

500|$|A sturdy thin-legged antelope, the nilgai is characterised by {{a sloping}} back, a deep {{neck with a}} white patch on the throat, a short mane of hair behind and along the back ending behind the shoulder, and around two white spots each on its face, ears, cheeks, lips and chin.

500|$|Living in {{the very}} {{southern}} end of the plains zebra's range, the quagga had a thick winter coat that moulted each year. Its skull was described as having a straight profile and a [...] diastema, and as being relatively broad with a narrow occiput. Like other plains zebras, the quagga did not have a <b>dewlap</b> on its neck as the mountain zebra does. The 2004 morphological study found that the skeletal features of the southern Burchell's zebra population and the quagga overlapped, and that they were impossible to distinguish. Some specimens also appeared to be intermediate between the two in striping, and individuals of the extant Burchell's zebra population still exhibit limited striping. It can therefore be concluded that the two subspecies graded morphologically into each other. Today, some stuffed specimens of quaggas and southern Burchell's zebra are so similar that they are impossible to definitely identify as either, since no location data was recorded. The female specimens used in the study were larger than the males on average.|$|E

50|$|Numerous {{other animals}} of both modern and prehistoric times use both skin or bone {{protrusions}} {{to make themselves}} seem more threatening, attract mates or to thermoregulate. Examples of these are the usage of <b>dewlaps</b> and crests in lizards, dinosaurs and birds.|$|R
500|$|The Cuban iguana {{is a large}} lizard, with {{an average}} body length of [...] from snout to vent (the base of the tail). On rare occasions, {{individual}} males with lengths of [...] when measured from the snout {{to the tip of}} the tail have been recorded at the wildlife sanctuary within the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base (GTMO), Cuba with females being two thirds that size. The species is sexually dimorphic: males are much larger than females, and males have enlarged femoral pores on their thighs, which are used to release pheromones to attract mates and mark territory. The skin of male Cuban iguanas ranges in color from dark gray to brick red, whereas that of females is olive green with dark stripes or bands. In both sexes, limbs are black with pale brown oval spots and solid black feet. Young animals tend to be dark brown or green with faint darker striping or mottling in five to ten diagonal transverse bands on the body. These bands blend in with the body color as the iguana ages. Both sexes possess a <b>dewlap</b> (skin hanging below the neck) and a row of spines running down their back to their thick tail. [...] Their heads and necks are short and stout, their teeth are solid and broad, and they have powerful jaw muscles. [...] Their jowls, which grow larger as the animal ages, are covered in spiky protuberances called tubercles.|$|E

50|$|A {{caruncle}} {{is defined}} as 'a small, fleshy excrescence that is {{a normal part of}} an animal's anatomy'.

2500|$|These iguanas are {{characterized}} by the growth of bony prominent tubercles on their snouts which resemble horns. [...] Dr. Thomas Wiewandt, who spent an extended period on Mona Island studying Cyclura cornuta stejnegeri, suggested that the horns, along with lateral spines and prominent parietal bulges, function as protective armor against sharp rocks or as defensive tools to facilitate the escape of males from the grasp of one another. [...] Males possess an adipose pad {{in the form of}} a helmet on the occipital region of the head, and a large <b>dewlap.</b> This species, like other species of Cyclura, is sexually dimorphic; males are larger than females, and have more prominent dorsal crests and [...] "horns" [...] in addition to large femoral pores on their thighs, which are used to release pheromones.|$|E
