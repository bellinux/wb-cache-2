5|$|Lasting {{impressions}} of the war experience are ever-prevalent on the island. In Canada, 1 July is celebrated as Canada Day, in recognition of Canadian confederation. In the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador the date is Memorial Day, in remembrance of the Newfoundland Regiment's losses at Beaumont-Hamel. Memorial University College, now Memorial University of Newfoundland, was originally established as a memorial to Newfoundlanders who <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> in active service during the First World War. Lastly, the six caribou memorials and the National War Memorial erected following the First World War, {{and the establishment of}} the preserved battlefield park at Beaumont-Hamel which is visited by thousands of tourists a year. The Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial site also serves an informal ambassadorial function, educating visitors not only about the experience of the Newfoundland Regiment but also regarding the history of the island.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{a backup}} relief party of 77 teams and wagons was {{making its way}} east to provide {{additional}} assistance to the Martin Company. After passing Fort Bridger {{the leaders of the}} backup party concluded that the Martin Company must have wintered east of the Rockies, so they turned back. When word of the returning backup relief party was communicated to Young, he ordered the courier to return and tell them to turn back east and continue until they found the handcart company, but several days had been lost. On November 18 the backup party met the Martin Company with the greatly needed supplies. At last {{all the members of the}} handcart party were now able to ride in wagons. The 104 wagons carrying the Martin Company arrived in Salt Lake City on November 30; at least 145 members of the company <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> Many of the survivors had to have fingers, toes, or limbs amputated due to severe frostbite.|$|E
5|$|The 1994 Imola layout, {{which had}} been in place since 1981, was never again used for a Formula One race. The circuit was heavily {{modified}} following the race, including a change at Tamburello—also the scene of major accidents for Gerhard Berger (1989) and Nelson Piquet (1987)—from a high speed corner to a much slower chicane. The FIA also changed the regulations governing Formula One car design, {{to the extent that}} the 1995 regulations required all teams to create completely new designs, as their 1994 cars could not be adapted to them. The concern raised at the drivers briefing the morning of the race, by Senna and Berger, would lead to the Grand Prix Drivers' Association reforming at the following race, the 1994 Monaco Grand Prix. The GPDA, which was founded in 1961, had previously disbanded in 1982. The primary purpose of it reforming was to allow drivers to discuss safety issues with a view to improve standards following the incidents at Imola. The front two grid slots at the Monaco Grand Prix that year, which were painted with Brazilian and Austrian flags, were left clear in memory of the two drivers who <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives,</b> while both Williams and Simtek entered only one car each. Additionally, a minute of silence was observed before the race.|$|E
