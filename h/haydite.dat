50|$|The City of Neenah {{began in}} 1835 as an {{agricultural}} and industrial mission for the Menominee Indians. It {{was named after}} the American Indian term for water. After the Civil War, rail transportation was a large factor {{in the growth of}} Neenah’s local economy. One major outcome of this was the development of the Kimberly-Clark Corporation in 1872. John Alfred Kimberly was one of four men who started this successful company.In 1929, Helen Kimberly Stuart (daughter of J. A. Kimberly) donated some land to the City of Neenah. This land, which overlooked the confluence of Lake Winnebago and the Fox River, was named Kimberly Point Park. In 1944, J. C. Kimberly (son of J. A. Kimberly) realized there was a need for a light to mark the entrance to the river. He donated the $7,500 and hired Flour Brothers Construction Company of nearby Oshkosh {{for the construction of a}} 40 ft, brick and <b>Haydite</b> block lighthouse. The lighthouse began guiding boaters into the Neenah Harbor in 1945. It was later raised to 49 ft in 1954.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Using {{sewage sludge}} to {{manufacture}} green high performance <b>haydite</b> was investigated. Sewage sludge was blended with fly ash and river silt, made into raw <b>haydite</b> pellets and sintered. The <b>haydite</b> properties of different mix proportions and sinter parameters were studied. Then microstructure analysis and toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) were performed. Results show that reducing sludge percentage of raw pellets decreases water absorption, also makes particle strength and apparent density raise. Increasing preheat temperature enhances particle strength and density while reduces water absorption. Sintered with optimum parameters, density grade of sludge <b>haydite</b> is 700, water absorption is 0. 6 %, and cylinder compressive strength is 6. 6 MPa. Microstructure analysis shows enamel surface and internal fine porous structure make <b>haydite</b> lightweight, high strength and low water absorption. And TCLP results show traces of heavy metal content {{are found in}} sludge <b>haydite...</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractRemoval {{effects of}} organic {{pollutants}} {{in drinking water}} by activated carbon, <b>haydite</b> and quartz sand were studied with the method of solid-phase extraction (SPE) and GC-MS analyzing in this study. There were 42 species organic pollutants in 11 categories detected in drinking water. The removal rates of total peak area of organic pollutants by activated carbon, <b>haydite</b> and quartz were 70. 35 %, 29. 68 % and 37. 36 %. Among all, activated carbon showed the best removal effect to most organic pollutants contents, and quartz sand to species.

40|$|This {{report is}} {{concerned}} with the prediction of the long-time creep and shrinkage behavior of concrete. It is divided into three main areas. l. The development of general prediction methods that can be used by a design engineer when specific experimental data are not available. 2. The development of prediction methods based on experimental data. These methods take advantage of equations developed in item l, and can be used to accurately predict creep and shrinkage after only 28 days of data collection. 3. Experimental verification of items l and 2, and the development of specific prediction equations for four sand-lightweight aggregate concretes tested in the experimental program. The general prediction equations and methods are developed in Chapter II. Standard Equations to estimate the creep of normal weight concrete (Eq. 9), sand-lightweight concrete (Eq. 12), and lightweight concrete (Eq. 15) are recommended. These equations are developed for standard conditions (see Sec. 2. 1) and correction factors required to convert creep coefficients obtained from equations 9, 12, and 15 to valid predictions for other conditions are given in Equations 17 through 23. The correction factors are shown graphically in Figs. 6 through 13. Similar equations and methods are developed for the prediction of the shrinkage of moist cured normal weight concrete (Eq. 30 }, moist cured sand-lightweight concrete (Eq. 33 }, and moist cured lightweight concrete (Eq. 36). For steam cured concrete the equations are Eq. 42 for normal weight concrete, and Eq. 45 for lightweight concrete. Correction factors are given in Equations 47 through 52 and Figs., 18 through 24. Chapter III summarizes and illustrates, by examples, the prediction methods developed in Chapter II. Chapters IV and V describe an experimental program in which specific prediction equations are developed for concretes made with <b>Haydite</b> manufactured by Hydraulic Press Brick Co. (Eqs. 53 and 54 }, <b>Haydite</b> manufactured by Buildex Inc. (Eqs. 55 and 56), <b>Haydite</b> manufactured by The Cater-Waters Corp. (Eqs. 57 and 58 }, and Idealite manufactured by Idealite Co. (Eqs. 59 and 60). General prediction equations are also developed from the data obtained in the experimental program (Eqs. 61 and 62) and are compared to similar equations developed in Chapter II. Creep and Shrinkage prediction methods based on 28 day experimental data are developed in Chapter VI. The methods are verified by comparing predicted and measured values of the long-time creep and shrinkage of specimens tested at the University of Iowa (see Chapters IV and V) and elsewhere. The accuracy obtained is shown to be superior to other similar methods available to the design engineer...|$|E
30|$|Currently, {{the most}} popular {{treatments}} for ammonia removal from wastewater are air stripping, ionic exchange and nitrification denitrification techniques where however, ammonia cannot be removed completely in most cases. For this reason {{in the recent years}} advanced oxidation processes have been investigated as the alternatives to conventional water treatment. [29] used the photocatalytic reduction method of Pt / TiO 2 nano-photocatalysts with high platinum loading of 0.5  % to achieve the best efficiency of nitrogen removal. [47] conducted TiO 2 photocatalyst doped with metal ions for treating ammonia nitrogen wastewater from coal gasification process. The ammonia nitrogen removal rate was approximately 79  %. Songhua River water treatment using catalyzed ozonation were investigated by [50]. In these cases, Nano TiO 2 coated <b>haydite,</b> silica-gel and zeolite were used as the catalyst. The ammonia removal efficiency was close to 80  % after 30  min reaction.|$|E
40|$|With {{its growing}} {{emphasis}} on sustainability, {{the construction industry}} {{is more interested in}} applying environmentally friendly concrete, also known as “gre en” concrete, in its construction projects. Among other benefits, concrete made with alternative or recycled waste material can reduce pollution and energy use, as well as lower the cost of concrete production. However, the impacts of these alternative mat erials on concrete properties have not been fully understood, which limits the wide applications of “green” concrete in practice. This study investigates the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict the compressive strength (CS) of concr ete made with alternative materials such as fly ash, <b>Haydite</b> lightweight aggregate and Portland limestone cement. A feed - forward Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model was applied for this purpose. To determine the accuracy and flexibility of this approach, two different input methods (relative and numerical) were tested on the generated ANN models. The results showed that concrete made of Portland limestone cement had slightly better CS than concrete made of Portland cement. Generally, both input methods provid ed adequate accuracy to predict CS. It was also observed that a proper MLP model with one hidden layer and sufficient neurons (depending on the input variables and type of cement) could effectively predict the CS of “green” concrete...|$|E
40|$|Extensive {{programmed}} {{laboratory tests}} involving some 400 asphalt emulsion slurry seals (AESS) were conducted. Thirteen aggregates including nine Iowa sources, a quartzite, a synthetic aggregate (<b>Haydite),</b> a limestone stone from Nebraska, and a Chat aggregate from Kansas {{were tested in}} combination with four emulsions and two mineral fillers, {{resulting in a total}} of 40 material combinations. A number of meetings were held with the Iowa DOT engineers and 12 state highway departments that have had successful slurry seal experiences and records, and several slurry seal contractors and material and equipment suppliers were contacted. Asphalt emulsion slurry seal development, uses, characteristics, tests, and design methods were thoroughly reviewed in conjunction with Iowa's experiences through these meetings and discussions and through a literature search (covering some 140 articles and 12 state highway department specifications). It was found that, while asphalt emulsion slurry seals (when properly designed and constructed) can economically improve the quality and extend the life of existing pavement surface, experiences with them had been mixed due to the many material, slurry, and construction variables that affect their design, construction, and performance. The report discusses those variables identified {{during the course of the}} project and makes recommendations concerning design procedures, design criteria, specifications and the means of evaluating them...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} Research Project HR- 182 was to {{identify}} those aggregate types which would perform satisfactorily as seal coat aggregates. Aggregates were chosen from across the State to represent the various types normally encountered and were used with {{two different types of}} binder bitumens. A water spray treatment was also included to simulate the effects of rainfall. The evaluation was based upon aggregate retention. Due to the influence of unexpected variables upon the field samples, the laboratory data are reliable for only the most general observations. Namely, that gravels as a group appear to be retained better than carbonates and rain-fall shortly after seal coat placement can affect aggregate retention. The subsequent field observations and analysis of skid resistance data permit the following conclusions: 1. Aggregate retention is influenced by lithologic type with the gravels, quartzite, <b>haydite,</b> dolomites, and medium grained limestones performing best. 2. Aggregate retention is not influenced by binder bitumen type. 3. Friction values of seal coats are influ-enced by aggregate retention and/or lithologic type. The following recommendations have been determined: The aggregate used for cover aggregate/seal coat projects should be Type 4 or better skid resistance as identified in Iowa DOT Materials Instructional Memorandum T- 203. This will result in maximizing the possibility of good aggregate retention and skid resistance...|$|E
40|$|With {{its growing}} {{emphasis}} on sustainability, {{the construction industry}} is increasingly interested in environmentally friendly concrete produced by using alternative and/or recycled waste materials. However, the wide application of such concrete is hindered {{by the lack of}} understanding of the impacts of these materials on concrete properties. This research investigates and compares the performance of nine data mining models in predicting the compressive strength of a new type of concrete containing three alternative materials as fly ash, <b>Haydite</b> lightweight aggregate, and portland limestone cement. These models include three advanced predictive models (multilayer perceptron, support vector machines, and Gaussian processes regression), four regression tree models (M 5 P, REPTree, M 5 -Rules, and decision stump), and two ensemble methods (additive regression and bagging) with each of the seven individual models used as the base classifier. The analytical results show that, with appropriate parameter settings, all of these models, except decision stump, achieved acceptable prediction performance. The ensemble methods improved the prediction accuracy of the four regression tree models but had less success on the other three advanced predictive models. The individual Gaussian processes regression model and its related ensemble models reached the highest prediction accuracy in comparison groups. The results of this paper offer valuable insights on improving the use of these models for property prediction of concrete...|$|E
40|$|Clay is a {{building}} material that {{could well be}} used as an alternative to Swedish conventional building materials. New research suggests that due to climate change greater focus needs to be put on the production of building materials and not only the operational phase of the building. Since clay building technique cannot be classed as an established construction technology in Sweden some factors are lacking sufficient knowledge. There is no existing study that treats the mixture of clay and charcoal, the material produced in this work would therefore complement the existing materials straw clay, wood chips clay and <b>haydite</b> (Leca) clay. This work can, through practical experiments on construction solutions and operation, contribute to developing the inadequate state of knowledge in Sweden. The aim of this work was that by laboratory experiments with different proportions of granulated clay, charcoal, sand and water produce a filling material with heat insulating properties for constructions. The following questions have been answered in this work: - What parameters are important or even crucial for the cohesion of the material? - In which degree is the material heat-insulating? - How does the material affect building's internal environment and the external environment, during the life of the material? To answer the first question about the cohesion of the material clay granules, charcoal, sand and water were mixed in different ratios and then analyzed. The material were then applied into a timber frame construction. Pondered and brought a hypothetical discussion of the heat-insulation value of charcoal clay to answer the second. The third question was answered by gathering information from literature and scientific publications which then were applied on the results. Finally other factors were discussed such as how the mixing process affected the results in terms of cohesion, the isolation ability of charcoal clay and rationality linked to the production process.

40|$|Structural {{lightweight}} concrete {{is a very}} versatile {{material and}} <b>Haydite</b> and Minergy lightweight aggregates can be utilized in the mixture development of concrete for use in girders and decks in bridges. More widespread use of lightweight aggregates (LWA) would result in savings in construction cost due to considerable dead load reduction. 	The materials phase of this research study evaluated the fresh concrete properties (slump, unit weight, and air content), the mechanical properties of hardened concrete (compressive strength, tensile strength, flexural strength, static and dynamic modulus of elasticity, Poisson’s Ratio, and temperature development), and durability related parameters (air void distribution, freeze-thaw resistance, chloride permeability, resistance to scaling, and drying shrinkage). In addition, selected properties (24 -hour absorption, bulk specific gravity, size distribution, and internal pore structure) of the lightweight aggregates were also determined. 	Lightweight aggregate mixes {{used in this study}} were proportioned using water-cement ratio/strength method in order to better address the issue of producing mixes that would satisfy both durability and strength requirements. Target compressive strengths for bridge girder concrete were 42 and 60 MPa (6000 and 10, 000 psi), and 31 MPa (4500 psi) in the case of bridge deck concrete. 	In the structural phase of the study the shear strength of reinforced and prestressed concrete lightweight concrete (LWC) beams was evaluated. In the Kettelhut Structural Engineering Laboratory twelve reinforced and four prestressed concrete beams were tested to failure. The experimental shear capacities were compared to calculated shear strength values from the 1995 American Concrete Institute Building Code and the 1994 AASHTO LRFD Standard Specifications. 	Based on the test results from this study it is recommended that water-cementitious ratio be used for proportioning of lightweight concrete mixes and that trial batches be prepared and tested before actual field application. To ensure adequate durability, lightweight aggregate concrete should be allowed to dry before exposing it to cycles of freezing and thawing. In the structural side, both the ACI and the AASHTO LRFD Specifications were found to yield conservative estimates of the shear strength of LWC reinforced and prestressed beams provided adequate detailing of the reinforcement is provided. More work is needed regarding the minimum amount of shear reinforcement for high strength lightweight concrete beams...|$|E
40|$|Green roof {{technology}} {{is becoming increasingly}} more popular in the U. S. as it provides several economical, sociological, and ecological benefits to urban environments. One specific advantage a vegetated rooftop is known to provide {{is its ability to}} retain water and release it at reduced rates. However, with increased interest in these systems, concerns regarding their influence on water quality have been raised. Green roofs can be complex systems {{and the degree to which}} water quality might be affected may be related to green roof construction and components within. To answer questions regarding green roof influence on metal contaminants in storm water runoff, a field study and a related laboratory study were designed to investigate potential impacts these systems may have on water quality with respect to heavy metals and some micronutrients. Overall, results obtained for Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn content observed in leachate collected from the constructs and media treatments from a green roof field study do not indicate that green roofs are a significant source of heavy metal and micronutrient contaminants in urban stormwater runoff and that planted Green Roof BlocksTM release less or the same metal content as planted built-in-place models. Elemental concentrations determined in effluent collected from treatments in the field study were collected for four rain events (June 28, 2007, October 18, 2007, February 4, 2008, and April 11, 2008) and compared to IEPA effluent standards to assess whether or not there were any negative impacts on water quality. Treatments for this portion of the investigation were empty built-in-place models (controls), planted and non-planted Arkalyte media at depths of 5 cm, 10 cm, 15 cm, and 20 cm in built-in place models, planted and non-planted commercial and potential green roof media in Green Roof BlocksTM. With the exception of excess Zn levels in collected effluent from the planted 10 cm treatments in October and the planted 5 cm treatments in February as well as the elevated Fe content in leachate obtained from planted glass media in October, metal concentration in effluent acquired from planted treatments were below effluent standards. Also determined to be above IEPA standards in October were Cu, Fe, and Pb measured in effluent obtained from non-planted glass media. The laboratory portion of this investigation evaluated several commercially-available substrates, bottom ash, lava rock, and composted pine bark to determine the total acid extractable and plant exchangeable content of eight elements (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn). In addition to this, effluent collected from planted and non-planted treatments using these substrates incorporated with 20 % composted pine bark were examined over a course of three leaching events. While all elements examined were observed to be within levels normally found in soils, results from the total acid extractable experiments demonstrate large variation in metal concentration with each substrate and composted pine bark. With the exception of total extractable Cd, there were differences in concentrations for the remaining total acid extractable metals between the substrates and amendment tested. An artificial leaching study was conducted in the phytotron at Southern Illinois University Carbondale and consisted of eight repetitions of planted in addition to eight repetitions of non-planted pots containing known volumes of 20 % composted pine bark blended with Arkalyte, <b>Haydite,</b> Lassenite, Axis, bottom ash, Axis + bottom ash, and lava which were subsequently leached over three separate leaching events. Collected effluent was evaluated for Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn content as well as volume of water displaced as a function of planting treatment, number of times leached, and substrate type. Metal content in the leachates were typically an order of magnitude lower than values obtained from the batch studies, and the planting, substrate, and leaching interactions varied for each metal with Pb being the most complex. The volume of water displaced upon leachate collection increased across all substrates as a function of leaching event...|$|E
