25|$|A spinner {{is a type}} of hubcap that spins {{independently}} {{inside of}} a wheel itself when a vehicle is in motion, and continues to spin once the vehicle <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> stop. As an attachment to the car's wheel, a spinner operates by using one or more roller bearings to isolate the spinner from the wheel, allowing it to turn while the wheel is at rest. The invention of the spinner is credited to James J.D. Gragg of Tulsa, Oklahoma who filed a patent on October 28, 1992 and was issued United States Patent 5,290,094 on March 4, 1994.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, a vast {{majority}} of the inhabitants of the Netherlands (82%) said they had never or almost never visited a church, and 59% stated that they had never been to a church of any kind. Of all the people questioned, 24% saw themselves as atheist, an increase of 11% compared to the previous study done in 2006. The expected rise of spirituality (ietsism) <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> halt according to research in 2015. In 2006 40% of respondents considered themselves spiritual, in 2015 this has dropped to 31%. The number who believed in the existence of a higher power fell from 36% to 28% over the same period.|$|E
25|$|The path on its whole course stays {{away from}} the {{hardwood}} forest; with the predominant montane and subalpine vegetation zone; spruce monoculture prevails. Acid rains, frequent in years 1980 and 1990 affected the area, though their destructive effect was not as powerful as in the lower zones. In some parts, especially around Mały Szyszak mountain meadows cover the large areas, used in 19th {{and in the first}} half of the 20th centuries as mountain pasture areas. This <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> standstill, although some traces of those activities, as old shepherd huts, can still be found; some of them have been converted into mountain huts.|$|E

25|$|The {{automatic}} brake works by monitoring the speed using a centrifugal governor connected by gears {{to a large}} toothed gear mounted on the pinion axle next to the wheel (i.e. {{it is not the}} pinion gear). When the set speed is exceeded a lever on the governor hits a lever on a brake valve, and the brakes operate. The {{automatic brake}} can only be released after the train <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> stop, and the driver has to leave the locomotive to reset the system. On the steam locomotives, steam is applied to a small brake cylinder that acts on the driver's side brakes. On the carriages, the automatic brake is an air brake. On the diesel locomotives, a hydraulic cylinder is used.|$|E
25|$|More recently, {{the issue}} of states' rights <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> head when the Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) {{recommended}} that Congress and the Department of Defense implement sweeping changes to the National Guard by consolidating some Guard installations and closing others. These recommendations in 2005 drew strong criticism from many states, and several states sued the federal government {{on the basis that}} Congress and the Pentagon would be violating states' rights should they force the realignment and closure of Guard bases without the prior approval of the governors from the affected states. After Pennsylvania won a federal lawsuit to block the deactivation of the 111th Fighter Wing of the Pennsylvania Air National Guard, defense and Congressional leaders chose to try to settle the remaining BRAC lawsuits out of court, reaching compromises with the plaintiff states.|$|E

The closest he <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> grand slam final was at the 2006 US Open semifinals when he took the first set from World No. 9 Andy Roddick, after {{upsetting}} World No. 2 Rafael Nadal in the quarterfinals.

500|$|Before {{giving his}} decision, Tyndareus bound all the suitors to his fateful oath: should anyone ever take his {{daughter}} by force, {{all those who}} had wooed her must exact vengeance upon her abductor. To this all the suitors readily agreed, each believing {{that he would be}} given Helen's hand. At this point the Catalogue of Suitors <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> close, but even as Menelaus' success is reported, the poet introduces Achilles because of his status as the greatest hero of the Trojan saga and his central role in Zeus's plan to bring the Heroic Age to a close. With the aid of Agamemnon, Menelaus had given the most bride prices, but were Achilles already of age, he would surely have won Helen's hand, [...] "for neither warlike Menelaus nor any other human on earth would have defeated him". But Achilles was not present, and Menelaus won Helen, who bore Hermione to him.|$|E
500|$|Head VI {{was first}} {{exhibited}} in November 1949 at the Hanover Gallery in London, in a showing organised {{by one of}} the artist's early champions, Erica Brausen. At the time, Bacon was a highly controversial but respected artist, best known for his 1944 Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion, which made him the enfant terrible of British art. Head VI drew a mixed reaction from art critics; John Russell, later Bacon's biographer, at the time dismissed it as a cross between [...] "an alligator shorn of its jaws and an accountant in pince-nez who <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> bad end". In 1989 Lawrence Gowing wrote that the [...] "shock of the picture, when it was seen with a whole series of heads... was indescribable. It was everything unpardonable. The paradoxical appearance at once of pastiche and iconoclasm was indeed one of Bacon's most original strokes." [...] Art critic and curator David Sylvester described it as a seminal piece from Bacon's unusually productive 1949–50 period, and one of Bacon's finest popes.|$|E

He put the onus of his party's coalition partner, saying, [...] "Whether it is MNS violence in the signboard or dalit killing at Khairlanji it shows an insensitive administration. The NCP president Sharad Pawar should seriously reflect on the working of the state home department." [...] Even NCP leaders including Ajit Pawar and Chhagan Bhujbal have told RR Patil and Deshmukh, in the cabinet meet to [...] "either act or shut up". Suggesting that the Maharashtra government was not keen on taking strong action against MNS chief Raj Thackeray, the NDA on Thursday described as [...] "stage-managed show" [...] the arrest and bail for him in cases of violence against north Indians in the state. BJP MP Shahnawaz Hussain said, [...] "Congress is Raj Thackeray's event management company and {{it is trying to}} project Raj's arrest as an event instead of making any serious effort to check the violent campaign of MNS against north Indians. There is match-fixing between Raj and the Maharashtra government. The state government deliberately books him under small sections and he gets bail." [...] Talking on the attacks on North Indian candidates at the All-India Railway Recruitment examinations in Mumbai, Rajya Sabha MP and JD-U national general secretary Shivananda Tiwari also attacked Congress for [...] "promoting" [...] the MNS chief and comparing him with slain Punjab separatist leader Bhindarwale. [...] "Congress party has a mastery in creating 'bhasmasurs' (self destructing demons). Earlier they created Bhindranwale in Punjab, which killed a Congress Prime Minister. Even this Raj Thackeray is ultimately going to damage Congress," [...] Tiwari claimed. He also alleged that Maharashtra government arrested Raj to carry out a [...] "formality" [...] and as mild charges were pressed, he got bail soon.|$|E
