25|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} on 7 September, El Mundo suggested that during the <b>flight</b> <b>preparation</b> and takeoff attempts, the aircraft had some of its systems in flight mode rather than ground mode. If true, this might explain why de-icing of the Total Air Temperature probe activated on the ground, causing overheating, since in flight the heater would activate only {{when there was no}} air flow in the probe, a sign of icing. This might also explain why the flaps and slats alarm had not sounded, since this alarm is disabled in flight mode.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, the Soviet {{space program}} re-oriented from lunar travel to orbital stations. In February 1970, Kamanin {{estimated}} first Almaz (Chelomei) or DOS-7K (Mishin) {{to be ready}} in summer 1971, at best. Selection of cosmonauts for the first orbital station, again, became a tug of war between Mishin and Kamanin, while the Air Force continued recruitment of new military pilots like Vladimir Dzhanibekov. 19 May - 19 June, Kamanin conducted the usual <b>flight</b> <b>preparation</b> and flight control sequence of Soyuz 9; health problems of cosmonauts returning from an 18-day mission caused a major redesign of future flight programs and another clash with Mishin (Mishin insisted on 30-days flights, Kamanin set {{for no more than}} 24 days).|$|E

2500|$|The {{steel balls}} were {{intended}} to prevent a nuclear detonation even if the explosives fired accidentally, or in any conceivable accident. The ball bearings {{had to be removed}} {{through the hole in the}} bomb casing during <b>flight</b> <b>preparation,</b> and after the bomb was winched into the aircraft. The ball bearings then had to be re-inserted into the lowered and upturned bomb before transport back to the bomb store. Quite obviously, without the ball bearings installed, these weapons were armed and live, and too dangerous to allow to be flown on exercises. Bomber Command exercises demonstrated that <b>flight</b> <b>preparation</b> followed by a scramble take-off could not be reduced below thirty minutes, and on exercises in bad weather and at night a ninety-minute scramble was the norm. At least one accident, dated 1960, was reported in the press when the plastic bung was removed and 133,000 steel ball bearings exited onto the aircraft hangar floor, leaving the bomb armed and vulnerable. The Royal Air Force were so nervous of the outcome of a fire in storage that permission was sought to store the bombs inverted, so that a loss of the plastic bung could not end with the steel balls on the floor, leaving the HEU unprotected against a subsequent explosion. Even without the partial nuclear detonation feared by the RAF, there was [...] "a risk of catastrophe" ...|$|E
2500|$|The group passed cosmonauts {{examinations}} 28 November 1962 and {{was put on}} hold {{until the}} end of April 1963. Preparation to the flight was impossible without a firmly set launch date, and nobody in the government dared to give a go-ahead. On 24 April, the government finally ordered a joint flight of two available Vostok spacecraft - the only two craft in stock. Their shelf life was set at 15 June 1963 and could not be extended. Thus, the <b>flight</b> <b>preparation</b> of Valery Bykovsky and Valentina Tereshkova (approved to fly 21 May) was hurried by [...] "use it or lose it" [...] deadline. Kamanin and the cosmonauts relocated to Baikonur 27 May and stayed there until the launch. In fact, Tereshkova lifted off 16 June - one day past her craft's expiration date. Kamanin worked mission control shifts while she was in space and had to wake Tereshkova who, asleep, failed to respond. Both crafts landed safely but overshot the landing target by two degrees. Like Gagarin, Tereshkova bailed from the landing capsule and used her personal parachute. After the flight, Kamanin again was involved in a time-consuming publicity campaign - this time, centered around Tereshkova.|$|E
