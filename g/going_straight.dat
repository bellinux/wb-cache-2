5|$|Desert Strike was an {{immediate}} commercial success, <b>going</b> <b>straight</b> {{to the top of}} sales charts. The game remained a top-10 best seller for months after its release, and was at the time Electronic Arts' highest selling game ever.|$|E
5|$|Premier League clubs {{agreed in}} {{principle}} in December 2012, to radical new cost controls. The two proposals {{consist of a}} break-even rule and a cap on the amount clubs can increase their wage bill by each season. With the new television deals on the horizon, momentum has been growing {{to find ways of}} preventing the majority of the cash <b>going</b> <b>straight</b> to players and agents.|$|E
5|$|His next film, Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye, {{was another}} gangster movie, {{which was the}} first by Cagney Productions since its acquisition. While {{compared}} unfavorably to White Heat by critics, it was fairly successful at the box office, with $500,000 <b>going</b> <b>straight</b> to Cagney Productions' bankers to pay off their losses. Cagney Productions was not a great success, however, and in 1953, after William Cagney produced his last film, A Lion Is in the Streets, the company came to an end.|$|E

5|$|Basic indoor venues may {{be adapted}} gymnasiums, which can easily {{accommodate}} high jump competitions and short track events. Full-size indoor arenas (i.e. those fully equipped to host all events for the World Indoor Championships) bear similarities with their outdoor equivalents. Typically, a central area {{is surrounded by}} a 200-metre oval track with four to eight lanes. The track can be banked at the turns to allow athletes to run around the radius more comfortably. Some have a second running track <b>going</b> <b>straight</b> across the field area, parallel to the straights of the main circuit. This track is used for the 60 metres and 60 metres hurdles events, which are held almost exclusively indoors.|$|E
5|$|Greaves was {{struggling}} with his fitness and his motivation. He felt {{he had become a}} journeyman footballer and lost motivation as he believed that apart from Moore, Geoff Hurst, Billy Bonds and Pop Robson, few of his teammates could play good football. Towards {{the end of his career}} with West Ham Greaves began to drink more and more alcohol, often <b>going</b> <b>straight</b> from training in Chadwell Heath to a pub in Romford, where he would remain until closing time. He later admitted that he was in the early stages of alcoholism. His final game came on 1 May 1971 in a 1–0 home defeat to Huddersfield Town. Greaves scored 13 goals in 40 games in all competitions for West Ham.|$|E
5|$|It {{was in the}} {{aftermath}} of these successes that Alcibiades resolved to finally return to Athens in the spring of 407 BC. Even {{in the wake of his}} recent victories, Alcibiades was exceedingly careful in his return, mindful of the changes in government, the charges still technically hanging over him, and the great injury he had done to Athens. Thus Alcibiades, instead of <b>going</b> <b>straight</b> home, first went to Samos to pick up 20 ships and proceeded with them to the Ceramic Gulf where he collected 100 talents. He finally sailed to Gytheion to make inquiries, partly about the reported preparations of the Spartans there, and partly about the feelings in Athens about his return. His inquiries assured him that the city was kindly disposed towards him and that his closest friends urged him to return.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{a forest}} over there across the prairie," [...] said the Wizard, [...] "and {{it lies in}} the {{direction}} we are <b>going.</b> Make <b>straight</b> for the forest, Sawhorse, and you're bound to go right." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But {{there is}} some screw loose. Simpson came up to my father about it yesterday, and the {{governor}} let enough of the cat {{out of the bag}} to make me know that the thing is not <b>going</b> as <b>straight</b> as she wishes." ...|$|R
5|$|Norwich City manager Paul Lambert was keen to sign Forster who he {{had seen}} play for both Stockport and Bristol Rovers. Forster then signed for Norwich City in a one-month loan deal. It was then {{extended}} {{to the end of}} January 2010 after making an impressive debut against Hartlepool in the 2–0 victory at Victoria Park. Forster received a red card on 26 September 2009 against Gillingham for bringing Curtis Weston down in the penalty area, however this was considered to be a controversial decision. He made a blunder in a 2–1 defeat against Leeds United on 19 October, with a 90th-minute goal kick <b>going</b> <b>straight</b> to Jermaine Beckford who scored.|$|E
5|$|When {{the outer}} walls {{were built in}} the 13thcentury the main {{entrance}} was enhanced. A vaulted corridor led uphill from the outer gate in the northeast. The corridor made a hairpin turn halfway along its length, making it an example of a bent entrance. Bent entrances were a Byzantine innovation, but that at Krak des Chevaliers was a particularly complex example. It extended for , and along its length were murder-holes which allowed defenders to shower attackers with missiles. Anyone <b>going</b> <b>straight</b> ahead rather than following the hairpin turn would emerge in the area between the castle's two circuits of walls. To access the inner ward, the passage had to be followed round.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{previous}} seasons the 2009 Air New Zealand Cup did {{not have}} quarterfinals in their finals format, instead <b>going</b> <b>straight</b> to the semifinals with the top four teams rather than the top eight.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're a great girl, Pamela," [...] {{her brother}} declared. [...] "I'm off downtown, feeling a {{different}} man. And, Pamela, I haven't said much, but God bless you, {{and as long}} as I live I'm <b>going</b> as <b>straight</b> as a die. I've had my lesson." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know where}} I 'm going to," [...] said Betty, piling the dolls into her apron with more haste than care. [...] "I'm <b>going</b> right <b>straight</b> home to tell Ma all about it. I don't like such actions, and I 'm afraid to stay." ...|$|R

25|$|The letter rho (ρ) {{can occur}} in {{different}} stylistic variants, with the descending tail either <b>going</b> <b>straight</b> down or curled to the right. The symbol ϱ (U+03F1) is designated specifically for the curled form, used as a technical symbol.|$|E
25|$|In some variations, {{the playing}} of certain scores, {{especially}} scores involving point cards, might be mandatory and cannot be skipped. For example, if 10 is mandatory {{and a team}} goes up 2 ranks after playing 9, {{they will have to}} play 10 first, instead of <b>going</b> <b>straight</b> to jack.|$|E
25|$|France {{won their}} first major title {{at home in}} the 1984 tournament, with their captain Michel Platini scoring 9 goals in just 5 games, {{including}} the opening goal in the final, in which they beat Spain 2–0. The format also changed, with the top two teams in each group going through to a semi-final stage, instead of the winners of each group <b>going</b> <b>straight</b> into the final. The third place playoff was also abolished.|$|E
2500|$|The town {{itself is}} {{situated}} near the innermost {{part of the}} deep Ofotfjord, but even here the mountains, <b>going</b> almost <b>straight</b> up from the blue fjord, reach as high as [...] in Skjomen, where the glacier Frostisen can be seen. Other fjords in Narvik include Beis Fjord, Herjangsfjord, and Rombaken.|$|R
6000|$|Rose evidently had {{forgotten}} {{that the family}} of Squeers ever existed, for she answered: [...] "Hard, please," [...] in a voice to match. [...] "I'm {{glad to see you}} doing that," [...] she added, taking courage from his composure and <b>going</b> as <b>straight</b> to her point as could be expected of a woman.|$|R
50|$|The {{judge will}} step {{backwards}} again and have {{another look at}} the legs from behind. The legs should look <b>straight</b> <b>going</b> all the way down.|$|R
25|$|On 15 July 1822, in the MCC v Kent {{match at}} Lord's, Willes opened the bowling for Kent and was {{promptly}} no-balled for using his roundarm action. He {{had been trying}} at various times to introduce the style since 1807. Being no-balled on this occasion was the final straw, for Willes reportedly threw the ball away and withdrew from the match, literally <b>going</b> <b>straight</b> to his horse and riding away. He refused to play again in any important fixture.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, {{a decree}} in Paris allowed cyclists {{in that city}} to turn right or, {{if there is no}} street to the right, proceed {{straight}} ahead on red, under the condition that they “exercise caution” and yield to pedestrians, after road safety experts deemed the measure would reduce collisions. During the summer of 2015, Paris law was modified to allow cyclists to treat certain stop lights as yield signs as allowed by signage. The change only applied to right turns or <b>going</b> <b>straight</b> at a T-junction.|$|E
25|$|In Newfoundland and Labrador, because Radio Noon starts {{immediately}} after Q, the final half-hour on Fridays does not air. Instead, an abbreviated localized version of Deep Roots airs at 3:30/3:00. Also, because On the Go starts at 4:00/3:30, the programs {{listed in the}} 3:30/3:00-hour are pre-empted. However, except for The Choice and And the Winner Is..., those pre-empted shows can be heard at other times throughout the week. And finally, the second edition of The World This Hour does not air at 5:30/5:00, instead <b>going</b> <b>straight</b> into The Fisheries Broadcast.|$|E
25|$|Rahul Dravid (38) {{given out}} by Steve Bucknor – Dravid tucked bat and glove behind his pads as he {{successfully}} padded away a delivery from Andrew Symonds. Adam Gilchrist caught {{the ball and}} appealed for caught behind and Bucknor gave it out. Replays revealed a small deflection of the pads <b>going</b> almost <b>straight</b> into Gilchrist's hands.|$|R
50|$|Gordon was a 2 year varsity {{starter in}} center field for head coach Stan Luketich. He was an {{important}} part of the 2005 Desert Vista team who spent the whole season under the radar, and eventually lost in the Arizona 5A semi-finals against a very talented Horizon High School. Gordon set a school record by <b>going</b> 68 <b>straight</b> at-bats without a strikeout.|$|R
6000|$|... "The trooper {{found your}} two {{cartridges}} and the posts Bob gave us. You {{were at a}} big stump, Bob a short distance on your left, although he declares he had not a gun. My stand was on your other side. The warden's track across the brush was plain. He was <b>going</b> nearly <b>straight</b> for the stump and the bullet mark is at {{the middle of his}} chest." ...|$|R
25|$|After this, {{he played}} at the China Open, where he lost to Kevin Anderson. Still in China, his next tournament was the Shanghai Rolex Masters, where he fell to Spaniard David Ferrer in the quarterfinals. After this, he {{played at the}} Swiss Indoors Basel, where he lost to Roger Federer in the quarterfinals. <b>Going</b> <b>straight</b> to Paris for the BNP Paribas Masters, he had a third-round loss to Andy Murray. This loss ended Roddick's 2011 season, which left {{him out of the}} top 10, after being there for nine {{consecutive}} years.|$|E
25|$|At this point, {{the thread}} is woven. Depending on the era, one person could manage {{anywhere}} from 3 to 100 machines. In the mid nineteenth century, four was the standard number. A skilled weaver in 1925 would run 6 Lancashire Looms. As time progressed new mechanisms were added that stopped the loom any time something went wrong. The mechanisms checked {{for such things}} as a broken warp thread, broken weft thread, the shuttle <b>going</b> <b>straight</b> across, and if the shuttle was empty. Forty of these Northrop Looms or automatic looms could be operated by one skilled worker.|$|E
25|$|Past the {{junction}} with NY238, which forks {{off to the}} southeast towards Attica, the highway begins <b>going</b> <b>straight</b> up and down into the creek valleys here at the northern fringe of the Allegheny Plateau. Passing lanes are sometimes available on the downhill sections, particularly in the next community to the east, Alexander, where another route to Attica, NY98 crosses via an overpass. This allows traffic to continue at a high speed through the surrounding dairy and sod farms up {{the other side and}} into Bethany, the next town, whose four four-way intersections offer no traffic control devices to slow down drivers.|$|E
5000|$|Replacing the [...] "Coke bottle" [...] styling {{was a more}} [...] "swoopy" [...] body style, {{while still}} {{retaining}} some traditional elements. The top of the rear window line <b>going</b> almost <b>straight</b> down to {{the lip of the}} trunk lid, a look that was to epitomize F-body styling for the longest period during the Firebird's lifetime. The new design was initially characterized with a large C-pillar, until 1975 when the rear window was enlarged.|$|R
50|$|It was {{all up to}} Botham to help take England {{past the}} 250-mark. To his credit, Kapil kept Amarnath and Azad <b>going.</b> Azad bowled <b>straight,</b> {{somewhat}} predictably, and Botham reverse-swept (not a very common shot in 1983) for two.|$|R
50|$|Fleming entered Wimbledon with Marray. The two {{made it to}} {{the third}} round, but they couldn't {{replicate}} the form that saw Marray clinch the title during the previous season, <b>going</b> out in <b>straight</b> sets to Daniel Nestor, and Robert Lindsteadt.|$|R
