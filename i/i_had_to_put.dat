500|$|A 163-minute {{version of}} the film competed in the main {{competition}} of the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. The Cannes cut lacked much of the finished film's sound design, and some visual effects were not fully in place. Noé said about the version: [...] "the film was like a baby of three months. I took {{it out of my}} belly to show it, flattered by [...] Thierry Frémaux's invitation, but it was still in gestation. So <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it back into my belly, that is to say to tweak many details." ...|$|E
500|$|Working with {{a budget}} of $200,000, Dassin could not afford top stars for the film. To carry the lead role, Dassin {{selected}} Jean Servais, an actor whose career had slumped due to alcoholism. For Italian gangster Mario Ferrati, Dassin cast Robert Manuel after seeing him perform a comic role {{as a member of}} Comédie-Française. After a suggestion made by the wife of the film's producer, Dassin cast Carl Möhner as Jo the Swede. Dassin would use Möhner again in his next film He Who Must Die. Dassin himself played the role of the Italian safecracker César the Milanese. Dassin explained {{in an interview that he}} [...] "had cast a very good actor in Italy, whose name escapes me, but he never got the contract!...So <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> on the mustache and do the part myself".|$|E
500|$|By September 2013, Sia was {{recording}} vocal tracks at {{her home}} studio {{with the hope of}} releasing a new album the following spring. Later that year, a team of RCA Records representatives including the label's CEO Peter Edge met with Sia to discuss a record deal. The singer agreed to a contract for a new album in which she was not obliged to tour or do press appearances to promote the album. In an interview published by NME in February 2015, Sia revealed that 1000 Forms of Fear was released as a contractual obligation: [...] "Basically, I put this out {{to get out of my}} publishing deal. I was planning to be a pop song writer for other artists. But my publishing deal was as an artist so <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> one more album out. I didn't want to get famous so I kept all the songs I wanted and had a lot of fun making it." ...|$|E

500|$|Bachchan {{said that}} Sam was his most {{difficult}} character to play, {{and he worked}} hard on his gestures and mannerisms: [...] "I had {{to work very hard}} to portray a straight man acting gay. It could easily have gone over-board. I wanted to avoid making the character caricatural [...] Barring one portion ... we kept it controlled." [...] Bachchan and Abraham, who had gained weight for their earlier films, had to lose the weight and become more muscular. Although Chopra agreed to wear a swimsuit, she refused to wear a bikini. The actress said that that she did not lose any weight (as the media speculated), but worked out for a toned look in her films; she was also filming Fashion (2008) at the time. According to Chopra, [...] "For Fashion, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> on six kilos and later had to shed chip by chip as the character progressed in the film. My body structure in Dostana is more toned than in Fashion as it is a completely beach film. I've worked very hard on my body." ...|$|E
500|$|As well {{as being}} tragic, Dot is scripted as a comic character. Brown has {{discussed}} the humour she incorporates into her performances: [...] "I think Dot would be awfully boring if she weren't a bit comic [...] I always thought <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> an edge on it, an edge of comedy, which just means doing it more seriously than you would do. If {{you want to play}} comedy then {{you have to be very}} intense about it [...] very, very serious." [...] Some of Dot's catchphrases are used for humour, such as [...] "Ooh I say!", uttered when she is [...] "stuck for words". In 2004, Brown discussed the origin of the saying: [...] "It was written once in the script and I quite enjoyed it, so I used to say it occasionally when it wasn't in the scripts. It was useful because it could be said in all different ways. Dot's very straight-laced, so it helped to express her horror at what went on." [...] Brown revealed in 2008 that she has tried to cut down the use of this, along with the mispronunciation of her employer, Mr Papadopolous, as she has become a little embarrassed by them now they are so known. Mr. Papadopolous is the owner of the launderette where Dot works. In a long-running joke, Dot has difficulty pronouncing his surname, and for much of the show's history he has been referred to as Mr. Oppodopolus, Oppydoppy, or varying other mispronunciations. Brown has said she enjoys playing the comical aspects of Dot, stating, [...] "She's not dreadfully funny but she's amusing and I like that because it lightens it up a bit." ...|$|E
500|$|Apple and NeXT {{marketing}} executive and Jobs' confidant in the film. When discussing her audition for the film, Winslet later commented that she [...] "heard about {{it through a}} crew member who I happened {{to be working with}} , I didn't even care what role it was. I just wanted to be in it. Found out the nature of the role. Googled [...] Found one picture of her. Got my husband to go to a wig shop. Buy a short-haired dark wig. Stuck it on my head. Sent a photograph of myself to [...] Scott Rudin. Danny Boyle came to Melbourne and we had a meeting and he gave me the part." [...] Winslet spent considerable time with Joanna Hoffman to prepare for the role before production began. She noted that Hoffman [...] "has a softness to her. She came to America as a young woman and achieved a great deal. One thing that was unique about her as a figure in Steve's life was that she didn't need anything from him. She just needed for him to be the best version of himself. And that's what really set their relationship apart from any relationship with all his other colleagues." [...] Winslet credits Hoffman's difficult childhood (that began in Armenia) with her ability to manage Jobs. [...] On {{the nature of the relationship}} between Hoffman and Jobs, Winslet said that she and Fassbender [...] "were able to develop as literally co-workers. I do believe it was very similar to the relationship that Steve and Joanna had. She was like his work wife. She was head of marketing for the Macintosh, and then she stayed with him for his working life. She was an extraordinary, feisty Eastern European person who was pretty much the only person who could actually knock sense into Steve, and she was also kind of an emotional compass." [...] In developing her sense of the character, Winslet stated that she [...] "just wanted to please [...] as much as I could. How she sounds, and her accent, is fairly complicated. She grew up largely in Armenia, spent some time in Poland, and has Russians in her family, so she has all three accents, but she's been in America since she was a teenager, so she had American rhythms. You know, she really has this accent that goes way up and down. It's almost impossible to copy because of just how singsongy it becomes. So <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it into my own register. But we were all doing accents. I mean, Michael's Irish, and he's playing Steve Jobs, for God's sake." [...] Finally, Winslet notes that Hoffman [...] "did genuinely love [...] And spending time with her, when I was figuring out how to play this difficult part, she would become very emotional. She misses him terribly." ...|$|E

2500|$|With {{regards to}} role models, Brazilian {{football}} manager and former player Telê Santana has mentioned in one {{interview that he}} had no idols, though, [...] "My greatest satisfaction would be to manage a team such as 1974 Holland. It was a team where you could pick [...] Cruyff and place him on the right wing. If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> him in the left-wing, he would still play [...] I could choose Neeskens, who played both to the right and {{to the left of the}} midfield. Thus, everyone played in any position." ...|$|E

We were beaten by half-time."

He would not admit that any woman could draw up a document so cleverly guarded with qualifications.

2500|$|Burton {{said that}} portraying {{a younger age}} (16 at 21) was not a problem, except for one aspect: [...] "My only concern was when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> on my cheerleading uniform again. You forget how nerve-racking that is [...] the {{vulnerability}} of wearing bloomers." [...] She said she reread some of her journals {{from high school to}} get [...] "into that place" [...] as a high school student again, and that Peyton being similar to how she was in high school helped. [...] "It also helped that the town where we film, Wilmington, isn’t too different from the hometown where I grew up in Virginia. Both [...] small towns where high school sports played a big part," [...] she stated.|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} a {{farewell}} to Petra's first era of popularity {{and the sound}} it had cultivated with Volz's distinctive vocals. As constant touring took its toll on the band, Hartman and Volz began to disagree about Petra's future, both on stage and off. The tour, while it drew more fans than ever, was expensive, and it left Petra hurting financially. Increased competition from other Christian rock bands, for whom Petra had paved the way, led to lower-than-expected showings as the tour went on. As Hartman told CCM Magazine in 1986, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it in a nutshell without getting too deep, I {{would have to say}} it's business. Greg and I agree on just about everything except business." ...|$|E

2500|$|When the Rosary Way was {{successfully}} completed, Kossowski received [...] "the biggest ceramic commission that I ever had till then", The Vision of St. Simon Stock. Kossowski recalled:At that time I {{had already had}} some experience with the famous old Fulham Pottery which was still operating. They were quite ready to fire for me the larger pieces of ceramics in their old-fashioned kiln, one not used anymore elsewhere, heated by coal and coke. They could get only one temperature and one kind of glaze. You could not make any changes and I realized that every piece could be fired only once. So <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the colours and the glazes and the body in one firing only. It was a miracle that it came out quite alright, with very few small cracks. And the temperature {{had to be very}} high - at least 1200 degrees.|$|E
2500|$|A {{decade after}} the incident, former FCC {{chairman}} Michael Powell gave his first interview regarding Jackson's performance, saying Jackson was treated unfairly and the controversy, including his own reaction, was completely overblown. Powell stated, [...] "I think we've been removed from this long {{enough for me to}} tell you that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> my best version of outrage on that I could put on. Part of it was surreal, right? Look, I think it was dumb to happen, and they knew the rules and were flirting with them, and my job is to enforce the rules, but, you know, really? This is what we're gonna do?" [...] Powell also said the treatment of Jackson, who was lambasted for causing [...] "an outrageous stunt", was unfair, and commented on Timberlake not receiving the same backlash. [...] "I personally thought that was really unfair", he said. [...] "It all turned into being about her. In reality, if you slow the thing down, it’s Justin ripping off her breastplate." ...|$|E
2500|$|Arghezi {{later wrote}} that his {{relationship}} with Urmuz was difficult, especially since the grefier panicked that the establishment would discover his other career: [...] "he feared that the Cassation Court would better detect him as Urmuz than under his own name". The memoirist refers to Demetrescu-Buzău's perfectionism and unease, enhanced in the week before publication: [...] "He would {{wake up in the}} middle of the night and would send a very urgent letter, asking me if the comma after a 'that' should be moved before. I found him wandering around my house at night, shy, restless, fainthearted or in a hopeful trance, that something of substance may or may not be found in his prose, that perhaps there's an error, asking me to publish it, and then again to destroy it; to publish it together with a eulogistic note, and then again to curse him. He bribed [...] to change phrases and words that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> back into place, as previous editorial interventions were for sure better than his." [...] The letters they exchanged show that the grefier was not enthusiastic about even seeing his texts and his pseudonym in print, to which Arghezi was replying: [...] "from among the few we'll be cooperating with, you were my first choice".|$|E

2500|$|Mullen, who had mostly been {{absent from}} the {{sessions}} {{to start a family}} and nurse a worsening back injury, had major surgery on his back in November 1995. Mullen was unable to drum properly during this period, forcing U2 to abandon their usual methods of songwriting as a group but also allowing them to pursue different musical influences. Mullen admits that he was upset that the band entered the studio without him, cognizant that key decisions would be made in the early months of recording. Eno attempted to convince the other band members to wait for Mullen, but as the Edge explains, [...] "The thinking was {{that we were going to}} further experiment with the notion of what a band was all about and find new ways to write songs, accepting the influence, and aesthetics of dance music... we thought, 'Let's just start with Howie mixing drum beats and see where that gets us.'" [...] Mullen was back in the studio three weeks after his surgery, but his back prevented him from fully dedicating himself to recording. As he described, [...] "I needed a little more time to recover. But we were struggling with some of the material and for the project to move ahead, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> a lot of time in." [...] Sessions ceased temporarily in January 1996 to allow Mullen to rehabilitate.|$|E
2500|$|He {{has tried}} the mixture between flamenco and [...] {{classical}} music in works like Fantasía de cante jondo para voz y orquesta (Cante jondo Fantasy for voice and orchestra, together with pianist Antonio Robledo, guitarists Juan Habichuela and Gerardo Núñez and the Madrid Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Luis Izquierdo, 1986) or with Allegro Soleá, which he presented at Seville's Flamenco Biennal in 1990. Along {{the lines of}} the mixture of flamenco with other types of music, he collaborated in the show Macama Jonda by José Heredia Maya, together with the Tetuan Andalusian Orchestra and Abdessadeq Cheqara, or with the Bulgarian Voices choir Angelite. In Morente's aforementioned recording Omega, [...] he mixed flamenco singing with punk rock, music by Leonard Cohen, and lyrics by Federico García Lorca. In the show África-Cuba-Cai he mixed flamenco with music from Senegal, and Cuba (Cai is the way Cádiz is pronounced in Andalusian Spanish). The show also underlines the historic links between Cuban and flamenco music: [...] "That's always been close to flamenco, since way back, because the ships in Cádiz went to Cuba, some came and others stayed over there, we've always had that." [...] It is difficult to think of any kind of music which has not interested Morente. After one of his concerts with Cheqara Orkesta of Tetuan, he declared: [...] "…if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> out a CD for every culture I mixed with I'd be putting out about 7 or 8 CDs a year. It wouldn't be bad – if I got paid for it by the record company then I could build myself a home." ...|$|E
