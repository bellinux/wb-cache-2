5|$|Despite the {{discontinuation}} {{of internal}} game development at 3D Realms, {{development of the}} game did not cease entirely. Nine ex-employees including key personnel like Allen Blum, continued game development throughout 2009 from their homes. These <b>employees</b> <b>would</b> later become Triptych Games, an independent studio housed {{in the same building}} as Gearbox, with whom they collaborated on the project.|$|E
5|$|Sloan Gibson, who {{had been}} Acting Secretary between the time of Shinseki's {{resignation}} and McDonald's taking office, is now Deputy Secretary. He said on August 6, 2014 that more punishments were planned for VA officials for their roles in the scandal. The VA announced the week prior to Gibson's statement that two supervisors would be fired and four other <b>employees</b> <b>would</b> be disciplined for their roles in falsifying data in Colorado and Wyoming. The VA previously announced plans to fire three executives at the Phoenix VA. “These were the first in what I expect {{will be a long}} series of announcements of personnel actions,” said Gibson.|$|E

5|$|Looking Glass {{intended}} Flight Unlimited as {{a gateway}} into {{the video game}} publishing industry. According to Lerner, the idea of self-publishing had been considered when the company was founded. In 1995, Looking Glass projected that sales of Flight Unlimited would increase royalty revenues to $10 million that year, up from $1.5 million in 1994. Jeffrey A. Kalowski, the company's vice president of finance and administration, expected that the game would recoup its development costs and make a return {{before the end of}} the year. He predicted that, over the following 12 to 18 months, the company's number of <b>employees</b> <b>would</b> increase from 52 to 82. The company's executive vice president and general manager, Jerry Wolosenko, told The Boston Globe that the company hoped to publish six games each year. According to Doug Church, the pressure for Flight Unlimited to succeed meant that the concurrently-developed System Shock, which was not self-published, received little attention from the company's management.|$|E
5|$|On 24 April 2002, SAS {{announced}} that all handling services operated by Braathens {{would be taken}} over by SAS Ground Services. All SAS <b>employees</b> <b>would</b> be prioritized in the rationalization process, and 800 Braathens employees were laid off. Three hundred Braathens' employees were offered jobs with SAS Ground Services, but these lost their seniority. No employees in SAS lost their jobs. The case ended in the courts, where 369 former Braathens employees sued SAS to receive the same seniority as they had in Braathens. On 15 October 2003, Asker and Bærum District Court decided that only 42 of the employees, those working in Kristiansund and Molde, had right to keep their seniority. The case was appealed, and on 18 March 2005, Borgarting Court of Appeal, with four against three votes, decided in favor of SAS, denying the employees their claim. The matter was not settled until 31 January 2006, when the Supreme Court of Norway ruled in favor of the employees.|$|E
5|$|The Doughnut {{was already}} {{too small for the}} number of GCHQ staff at its completion, as a vast {{expansion}} in the number of employees had occurred {{as a consequence of the}} September 11 attacks in 2001. The staff numbered almost 6,500 by 2008. The addition of a two-storey office block and a three-storey car park to the Doughnut was proposed in 2008, but eventually suspended in 2011. The new buildings were intended to facilitate the arrival of 800 staff from GCHQ's former site at Oakley. Though it was initially felt that the Doughnut would be adequate for the new staff, 600 contractors working on technical projects for GCHQ were eventually relocated in a secret undisclosed building in the 'Gloucestershire area'. The parking of cars by GCHQ staff on residential roads has caused 'annoyance' among local residents in Benhall. It was believed that the arrival of new staff may have further affected local parking but GCHQ stated the presence of the new <b>employees</b> <b>would</b> have been offset by redundancies.|$|E

50|$|No Third-party communication: If an {{employer}} were {{to bring an}} employee into a sound-proof, isolated room, and accuse him of embezzling company money, the <b>employee</b> <b>would</b> have no defamation recourse, since no one other than the would-be plaintiff and would-be defendant heard the false statement.|$|R
5|$|There {{were many}} smaller textile {{concerns}} in the parish. Thomas Howarth owned a cottage in Stand Lane from where he sent yarn to be dyed and sized. He made his own warps which were weaved in the town. He would then travel to Preston and Kendal where drapers would purchase his products. His nephews founded A. & J. Hoyle's Mill in Irwell Street, which employed power weaving to produce their specialities in Ginghams and shirting. The mill closed in 1968. Messrs Stott & Pickstone's Top Shop on Stand Lane was the first company to employ powered looms and spinning around 1844. Many of their <b>employees</b> <b>would</b> eventually leave {{to start their own}} businesses, such as Spider Mill, built by Robert and William Fletcher, and John Pickstone. This mill closed around 1930.|$|E
5|$|Jackson's Weta Digital {{created the}} visual effects, which {{included}} computer-generated imagery, {{as well as}} scale models (which were necessary to make Wellington look American), prosthetic makeup and practical effects with help from Weta Workshop. Visual effects supervisor Richard Taylor explained that effects work on The Frighteners was complex due to Weta's inexperience with computer technology in the mid-1990s. Prior to this film, Weta worked largely with physical effects. With so many ghosts among its main cast, The Frighteners required more digital effects shots than almost any movie made up till that time. For a special effects company {{that had been in}} existence less than three years, the eighteen-month period for completing The Frighteners was largely stressful. Some shots were handled by a small New Zealand company called Pixel Perfect, many of whose <b>employees</b> <b>would</b> eventually join Weta Digital. Rick Baker was hired to design the prosthetic makeup for The Judge, portrayed by John Astin (the detachable jawbone was later added digitally). However, Baker was not able to apply Astin's five hours of makeup himself due to his commitment on The Nutty Professor. Makeup artist Brian Penikas (Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) fulfilled Baker's duties.|$|E
25|$|United Airlines {{employees}} {{continued the}} effort to buy the airline's parent company however and in 1993, the effort moved closer to realization. The Board of Directors of UAL in December 1993 agreed to an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP), where <b>employees</b> <b>would</b> agree to salary and benefit reductions as well as work rule changes in exchange for stock. <b>Employees</b> <b>would</b> have an equity stake of 55%, thus making them the majority owners of UAL Corporation. UAL became the world's largest employee-owned company.|$|E
50|$|A file is a {{collection}} of related records. If there are 100 employees, then each <b>employee</b> <b>would</b> have a record (e.g. called Employee Personal Details record) and the collection of 100 such records would constitute a file (in this case, called Employee Personal Details file).|$|R
5000|$|Payroll Savings Plans- Employers {{can provide}} {{employees}} this plan during sale periods.

50|$|Pregnancy {{policies}} {{state that}} women who are temporarily unable to perform their regular duties at work due to pregnancy or childbirth must receive the same benefits and treatment that a temporarily disabled <b>employee</b> <b>would</b> receive.

50|$|The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts logically {{extended}} the rule to include that superintendent as a fellow-servant, just another employee whose negligence in injuring a different <b>employee</b> <b>would</b> not render the employer liable. The injured employee presumably assumed {{the risk that}} even the superintendent might be grossly negligent.|$|R
50|$|An {{employer}} {{could avoid}} a redundancy payment by dismissing for misconduct during the notice period, {{but only for}} a repudiatory breach, which effectively means the <b>employee</b> <b>would</b> have acted as if he has torn up the employment contract, e.g. by going on strike, emptying the company safe or punching out the managing director.|$|R
25|$|Burton also {{observed}} that, under the majority's de minimis rule, the <b>employees</b> <b>would</b> receive no award. Burton noted that employees had admitted that {{as little as}} one minute was spent in preparatory work. Under the de minimis rule, almost no workers had a claim.|$|E
25|$|Romney instead offered two {{possible}} replacement systems, one involving individual unemployment savings accounts that <b>employees</b> <b>would</b> withdraw from {{when they lose}} their jobs, the other keyed on instituting financial incentives for businesses and other employers to hire and train {{those who had been}} unemployed for a long time.|$|E
25|$|When the company's 260 {{employees}} {{learned that}} the plant was indeed closing permanently on December 2, 2008, they came to collect their paychecks.

5000|$|Forfeiture {{provisions}} usually will {{be included}} only if the amounts deferred are supplemental benefits provided by the employer; normally the <b>employee</b> <b>would</b> not voluntarily defer current compensation if there is risk {{that he or she}} will forfeit those amounts (however, as discussed below, deferral plans for tax-exempt organizations often must include forfeiture provisions).|$|R

25|$|Mitsubishi's {{difficulties}} {{contributed to}} a sharp fall in the DaimlerChrysler group's profits, and following the recall of a further 1.5million cars in February 2001, including almost a million in the U.S., the German parent moved quickly to restructure; approximately 10,000 Mitsubishi <b>employees</b> <b>would</b> be axed {{and one of its}} four assembly plants would be closed.|$|E
40|$|The {{criminal}} law took a giant {{leap into the}} dark when the corporate facilitation of tax evasion offences came into force on 30 September 2017. Previously, where a company employee assisted a customer or supplier to evade tax, the <b>employee</b> <b>would</b> be criminally liable but the company would not. Now, both the employee and the company will be held criminally liable...|$|R
2500|$|Christmas and New Year are [...] "Mondayised" [...] holidays, so {{if these}} fall {{on a weekend}} that {{employee}} does not normally work then the holiday is transferred to the following Monday or Tuesday. If the <b>employee</b> <b>would</b> normally work on the particular weekend then it remains a traditional holiday and the employee is entitled to that day off on pay. If they normally work on both days, they are only entitled to the traditional holiday and the Mondayised holiday is treated as a normal work day.

This was estimated to leave 2–4 million Americans unable to afford family coverage under their employers’ plans and ineligible for subsidies.|$|R
