Often the cone structure includes optimizations to enhance high-frequency performance.

The shape and materials used in the cone and whizzer are highly optimized.|$|E
50|$|A speaker grille (or speaker grill) {{is usually}} found {{in front of}} many {{consumer}} and industrial loudspeakers, and consists of either a hard or soft / mounted directly over {{the face of the}} speaker driver. Its main purpose is to protect the <b>driver</b> <b>element</b> and speaker internals (and possibly other audio components) from foreign objects while still allowing the sound to clearly pass. However, because it sits in the direct path of the driver, the grille interacts with the sound produced. A suitable compromise between protection and sound quality must be made based on the speaker's application.|$|E
5000|$|The {{voice coil}} and magnet {{essentially}} form a linear motor working against the centering [...] "spring tension" [...] {{of the spider}} and surround. If there were no restriction on travel distance imposed by the spider and surround, the voice coil could be ejected from the magnet assembly at high power levels, or travel inward deep enough to collide {{with the back of}} the magnet assembly. The majority of speaker drivers work only against the centering forces of the spider and surround, and do not actively monitor the position of the <b>driver</b> <b>element</b> or attempt to precisely position it. Some speaker driver designs have provisions to do so (typically termed servomechanisms); these are generally used only in woofers and especially subwoofers, due to the greatly increased cone excursions required at those frequencies in a driver whose cone size is well under the wavelength of the some of the sounds it is made to reproduce (ie, bass frequencies below perhaps 100Hz or so).|$|E

Of these, the central 7 fuel elements are test elements and the remaining 26 are driver elements; 4 of the 7 test elements are designated as standard test elements. These elements are identical to the <b>driver</b> <b>elements</b> {{with the exception of}} the active fuel length. The remaining 3 test elements are designated as special test elements and incorporate fuel rods of smaller diameter and increased enrichment to obtain higher burnup rates, greater specific power, and higher fuel temperatures. Geometry design data for the various elements considered in the analysis was obtained from Dwg. No. 650 deg F, the mixed-mean coolant outlet temperature for the core at 1200 deg F (plus or minus 15 deg F), the maximum average temperature on the cladding at 1275 deg F, and the maximum fuel temperature in the range of 2000 to 2100 deg F. The thermal performance of the fuel elements was analyzed with the SORTD code and the Heating code. The results of the analysis are presented in tabular form.

For the special test, standard test, and highest powered <b>driver</b> <b>elements</b> the coolant outlet temperature is limited to values below 1200 deg F because of the specified maximum value of cladding temperature.

We show that each model reflects {{a different set of}} constraints acting either on the normal or tumor genome, and we identify the specific genome features that most contribute to these constraints. Importantly, we show that the somatic mutation model carries independent functional information {{that can be used to}} narrow down the non-coding regions that may be relevant to cancer progression. On this basis, we identify positions in non-coding RNAs and the non-coding parts of mRNAs that are both under purifying selection in the germline and protected from mutation in tumors, thus introducing a new strategy for future detection of cancer <b>driver</b> <b>elements</b> in the expressed non-coding genome...|$|R

5000|$|Hughes joined Altec Lansing in May 2002 {{to serve}} as senior {{engineering}} manager in the professional audio division.

The first was a patent for the optimum spacing of <b>driver</b> <b>elements</b> in a line array, using a minimum of drivers. This technology, marketed as [...] "InConcert", was at the core of Altec's compact computer speaker system FX 6021, a satellite and subwoofer system which used the patented process for its two satellite speakers, each containing six drivers mounted vertically. The two center drivers covered the frequency range from 150 hertz up to 20 kHz, the next two drivers above and below covered up to 6 kHz, and the top and bottom drivers covered up to 1 kHz. This allowed for good sounding results with six drivers mounted on a columnar surface that could physically accommodate eight or nine. Hughes' third patent, his second with Altec, was a patent for a dipole and monopole surround sound speaker system which used indirectly aimed drivers added {{to the top of the}} usual front left and front right loudspeakers. Altec brought the technology to market as the GT 5051R—a 3.1 system which included a center speaker and a subwoofer.

40|$|University of Minnesota PH. D. dissertation. December 2013. Major: Applied Economics. Advisor: Michael A. Boland. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); viii, 133 pages, appendices A-D. Fraternal benefit societies and township mutual fire insurance companies evolved from community-based mutual aid {{efforts in the}} 19 th century. Both are similar in nature to commercial mutual insurance companies, yet they both incorporate a number of elements of collective action theory. As such, they are a combination of an insurance provider and a community organization. This dissertation examines the history, evolution and survival of fraternal benefit societies ("fraternals") in the United States and township mutual fire insurance companies ("township mutuals") in Minnesota from their inception to 2013. In addition to a managerial economics analysis of the industries in which they operate, this dissertation provides a quantitative analysis of the relative determinants of survival for firms in these industries. This analysis, which primarily {{takes the form of}} a survival analysis, includes business <b>drivers,</b> <b>elements</b> of collective action theory and environmental and social factors in addressing the question of what types of firms are most likely to survive and what must the leaders of these organizations focus on to ensure their continued survival. The primary conclusion of this study is that although firms in these industries have a number of factors that contribute to their continued survival, ultimately they must be run as businesses. In other words, although it is appealing to think of the sentimental aspects of collective action organizations, ultimately, and over the long term, economic considerations dominate the discussion of which firms in the industry survive the longest. In particular, in the case of fraternals, economies of scale, growth and customer retention are highly and significantly correlated with survival. In the case of township mutuals, profitability and market size are the covariates most correlated with longer survival...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Sequence {{analysis}} of the orangutan genome revealed that recent proliferative activity of Alu elements has been uncharacteristically quiescent in the Pongo (orangutan) lineage, compared with all previously studied primate genomes. With relatively few young polymorphic insertions, the genomic landscape of the orangutan seemed like the ideal place {{to search for a}} <b>driver,</b> or source <b>element,</b> of Alu retrotransposition. Results Here we report the identification of a nearly pristine insertion possessing all the known putative hallmarks of a retrotranspositionally competent Alu element. It is located in an intronic sequence of the DGKB gene on chromosome 7 and is highly conserved in Hominidae (the great apes), but absent from Hylobatidae (gibbon and siamang). We provide evidence for the evolution of a lineage-specific subfamily of this shared Alu insertion in orangutans and possibly the lineage leading to humans. In the orangutan genome, this insertion contains three orangutan-specific diagnostic mutations which are characteristic of the youngest polymorphic Alu subfamily, Alu Ye 5 b 5 _ Pongo. In the Homininae lineage (human, chimpanzee and gorilla), this insertion has acquired three different mutations which are also found in a single human-specific Alu insertion. Conclusions This seemingly stealth-like amplification, ongoing at a very low rate over millions of years of evolution, suggests that this shared insertion may represent an ancient backseat <b>driver</b> of Alu <b>element</b> expansion. </p...|$|R
