50|$|The tacI and the tacII {{promoters}} respectively direct transcription approximately 11 and 7 {{times more}} efficiently than the derepressed parental lac UV5 promoter and approximately 3 and 2 times {{more efficiently than}} the trp promoter {{in the absence of}} the trp repressor. Both hybrid promoters can be repressed by the lac repressor and both can be derepressed with <b>isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside.</b> Consequently, these hybrid promoters are useful for the controlled expression of foreign genes at high levels in E. coli. In contrast to the trp and the lac UV5 promoters, the tacI promoter has not only a consensus -35 sequence but also a consensus Pribnow box sequence.

Induction of expression of the four unc genes {{by the addition of}} <b>isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside</b> resulted in inhibition of growth. During <b>isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside</b> induction, the three subunits of F 0 were integrated into the cytoplasmic membrane with a resultant increase in H+ permeability. A functional F 0 was formed from plasmid pBP 101 in a genetic background lacking all eight of the unc structural genes coding the F 1 F 0 complex. In the unc deletion background, a reasonable correlation was observed between the amount of F 0 incorporated into the membrane and the function measured, i. e., high-affinity binding of F 1 and rate of F 0 -mediated H+ translocation. This correlation indicates that most or all of the F 0 assembled in the membrane is active. Although the F 0 assembled under these conditions binds F 1, only partial restoration of NADH-dependent or ATP-dependent quenching of quinacrine fluorescence was observed with these membranes.

However, limitations have been observed in large-scale and microplate production, including toxicity, cost and culture monitoring. Here, we report the novel SILEX (Self-InducibLe Expression) system, which is a convenient, cost-effective alternative that does not require cell density monitoring or IPTG induction. We demonstrate the broad utility of the presented self-inducible method for a panel of diverse proteins produced in large amounts.

The positive clones showed a clear zone around the colonies. Analysis of mutants obtained by transposon mini-Mu dI(lacZ Kmr) mutagenesis indicated the coding region of the gene (dpe) and the utilization of a lacZ promoter of pUC 19 for transcription of dpe.

40|$|The {{addition}} of lactose, galactose, or <b>isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside</b> (IPTG) to glucose-grown cells of Streptococcus salivarius 25975 {{resulted in the}} co-induction of both the lactose-P-enolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (lactose-PTS) and beta-galactosidase, with the latter the predominant metabolic system. With various strains of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis 10556, on the other hand, the lactose-PTS was the major metabolic pathway with beta-galactosidase induced either to low or negligible levels. In all cases, induction of the lactose-PTS resulted in the concomitant induction of 6 -P-beta-galactosidase. The induction by lactose of both the lactose-PTS and beta-galactosidase in all strains was repressed by glucose and other catabolites, notably, fructose. Induction of beta-galactosidase in S. salivarius 25975 by IPTG was, however, relatively resistant to glucose repression. Induction experiments with IPTG and lactose suggested that a cellular metabolite of lactose metabolism was a repressor of enzyme activity. Exogenous cAMP was shown to reverse the transient repression by glucose of beta-galactosidase induction in cells of S. salivarius 25975 receiving lactose, provided the cells were grown with small amounts of toluene to overcome the permeability barrier to this nucleotide, cAMP, was however, unable to overcome the permanent repression of beta-galactosidase activity to a significant extent under these conditions...|$|E

Treatment of the cells with IPTG resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent induction of receptor expression. Maximal expression was obtained after treatment of the cells with 100 microM IPTG for 20 h, leading to a marked increase in receptor immunoreactivity detected by western blot, > 30 -fold stimulation of 3 H-labelled inositol phosphate (3 H-InsP) production, and a robust increase in intracellular calcium concentration in single cells after stimulation with 20 microM quisqualate. The basal level of 3 H-InsP accumulation in cells induced with IPTG was increased by two- to threefold as compared with control cells; however, this basal activity {{was found to be}} dependent on glutamate released by the cells into the incubation medium. Following IPTG treatment, stable {{expression of}} the mGlu 1 alpha receptor was maintained for at least 1 week.

40|$|A novel {{mammalian}} {{regulatory system}} {{was created by}} using the Escherichia coli lac repressor. The lac repressor was converted into a mammalian transcriptional activator by modifying the lac repressor coding region to include a nuclear localization signal from the simian virus 40 (SV 40) large tumor antigen and the transcription activation domain from the herpes simplex virus type 1 virion protein 16. The lac activator protein (LAP) fusions were potent activators of several promoters containing lac operator sequences positioned either upstream or downstream of the transcription unit. A single lac operator allowed for transactivation, whereas multiple operators acted synergistically when separated by a small distance. Promoters containing 14 or 21 operator sequences were induced at least 1, 000 -fold in response to LAP, reaching levels of activity 20 to 30 times {{greater than that of}} the SV 40 early promoter in HeLa cells. Activation was strongly inhibited by <b>isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside</b> (IPTG), indicating that LAP retained the functions needed for allosteric regulation.

This cell line contains an inducible Ha-rasVal 12 oncogene, which was under the regulation of the Escherichia coli (E. coli) lac operator/repressor system. We demonstrate that overexpression of activated Ha-ras oncogene by exogenous <b>isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside</b> (IPTG) under serum-depleted conditions can stimulate cell apoptosis. Cell cycle analysis showed {{that most of the}} 7 - 4 cells with Ha-ras overexpression accumulated at S-phase and that the expression level of p 34 cdc 2 kinase was decreased, suggesting that p 34 cdc 2 may be involved in 7 - 4 cell apoptosis. Overexpression of bcl- 2 transgene in these cells blocked Ha-ras-induced apoptosis, and this blockage was confirmed downstream of Ha-ras gene expression. Cycloheximide blocked the apoptosis of 7 - 4 cells in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that specific protein regulating apoptosis may be synthesized through Ha-ras overexpression. Ha-ras overexpression-triggered apoptosis was also prevented in the 7 - 4 derivatives that express either dominant-negative rasAsn 17 or dominant-negative raf- 1 C 4 B to suppress Ha-ras signal transduction at different stages, indicating that overexpression of activated Ha-ras can induce cell apoptosis and that raf- 1 pathway activity is required for this process...|$|E

The same treatments inhibit {{growth of the}} mutant at 42 degrees C but do not cause lysis. Strain VC 30 was used here to investigate the mechanism of host cell lysis induced by bacteriophage phi X 174. Strain VC 30 was transformed with plasmid pUH 12, which carries the cloned lysis gene (gene E) of phage phi X 174 {{under the control of}} the lac operator-promoter, and with plasmid pMC 7, which encodes the lac repressor to keep the E gene silent. Infection of strain VC 30 (pUH 12) (pMC 7) with phage phi X 174 culminated in lysis at 30 degrees C. At 42 degrees C, intracellular phage development was normal, but lysis did not occur unless a temperature downshift to 30 degrees C was imposed. Similarly, induction of the cloned phi X 174 gene E with <b>isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside</b> resulted in lysis at 30 degrees C but not at 42 degrees C. Temperature downshift of the induced culture to 30 degrees C resulted in lysis even in the presence of chloramphenicol.

40|$|Abstract Background Helicobacter pylori is an {{important}} pathogen responsible for human gastric problems like inflammation, ulcers and cancer. It is widely prevalent in developing countries with low socioeconomic status. Since the infection remains asymptomatic in most individuals, efforts for efficient diagnostic markers to identify high risk patients are warranted. In this study, we constructed an expression vector that overexpresses the H. pylori AhpC protein as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. We furthermore examined whether this recombinant fusion protein retained immunogenicity and thus would be useful as a diagnostic marker. Findings The full-length tsa A gene from H. pylori strain G 27, which encodes AhpC, was cloned in plasmid vector pGEX- 6 P- 2 to create the recombinant plasmid vector pGEX-tsaA. The nucleotide sequence of the clone showed 100 % homology with corresponding published sequence of original gene. Over-expression of the target protein GST-AhpC was achieved in E. coli BL 21 (DE 3) cells by induction with <b>isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside</b> (IPTG). GST-AhpC was extracted and identified using SDS-PAGE as a 52 [*]kDa protein. Western blotting results using commercial antibodies against whole cell H. pylori showed that the fusion protein retained immunogenecity. Conclusion A recombinant prokaryotic expression system was successfully established with high expression efficiency for target fusion gene pGEX-tsaA. The expressed GST-AhpC protein showed immunoreactivity against commercial anti- H. pylori antibodies. This recombinant fusion protein can be developed as a diagnostic marker for screening patients with chronic H. pylori infections. </p...|$|E
40|$|Agrobacterium radiobacter NCIB 11883 {{was grown}} in lactose-limited {{continuous}} culture at a dilution rate of 0. 045 /h. Washed cells transported [14 C]lactose and [methyl- 14 C]beta-D-thiogalactoside, a nonmetabolisable analog of lactose, at similar rates and with similar affinities (Km for transport, less than 1 microM). Transport was inhibited to various extents by the uncoupling agent carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, by unlabeled beta-galactosides and D-galactose, and by osmotic shock. The accumulation ratio for methyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside {{was greater than}} or equal to 4, 100. An abundant protein (molecular weight, 41, 000) was purified from osmotic-shock fluid and shown by equilibrium dialysis to bind lactose and methyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside, the former with very high affinity (binding constant, 0. 14 microM). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of this lactose-binding protein exhibited some homology with several other sugar-binding proteins from bacteria. Antiserum raised against the lactose-binding protein did not cross-react with two glucose-binding proteins from A. radiobacter or with extracts of other bacteria grown under lactose limitation. Lactose transport and beta-galactosidase were induced in batch cultures by lactose, melibiose [O-alpha-D-galactoside-(1 [...] 6) alpha-D-glucose], and <b>isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside</b> and were subject to catabolite repression by glucose, galactose, and succinate which was not alleviated by cyclic AMP. We conclude that lactose is transported into A. radiobacter via a binding protein-dependent active transport system (in contrast to the H+ symport and phosphotransferase systems found in other bacteria) and that the expression of this transport system is closely linked to that of beta-galactosidase...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the efficacy of using the Escherichia coli lac operator-repressor system to control plant gene expression. The lacI gene was modified to allow optimal expression in plant cells and then placed downstream of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35 S RNA promoter. This construct was introduced into tobacco plants by leaf disc transformation. Transgenic tobacco plants synthesized significant quantities of LacI protein (up to 0. 06 % of total soluble protein). We have used the E. coli beta-glucuronidase gene (gus) as the reporter gene by placing it downstream of the maize chlorophyll a/b binding protein (CAB) gene promoter. Lac operators were introduced into several positions within the CAB promoter and operator-free plasmid was used as control. Repression was assessed by comparing the transient expression from CAB-operator-gus reporter constructs in protoplasts expressing lac protein, with that in control cells not expressing the repressor. Repression varied between 10 and 90 % with different operator positions. Transient assays were also performed {{in the presence of}} the inducer, <b>isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside</b> (IPTG). In lacI protoplasts the presence of IPTG manifested itself in a 4. 2 -fold relief of repression. The study was extended to show regulation of expression in stable transformants. Tobacco transformants harbouring a CAB-operator-gus reporter construct and the lacI gene were shown to have repressed GUS levels, but in the presence of IPTG, repression was relieved 15 -fold. We conclude that the lac repressor can enter the plant cell nucleus, find its cognate operator sequence in the chromatin to form a repressor [...] operator complex and effectively block transcription of a downstream gene...|$|E

Zhang and B. Moss, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88 : 1511 - 1515, 1991). Further studies indicated that the yield of infectious virus could be regulated by titration with IPTG and that virus production was arrested by IPTG removal at appropriate times. Under nonpermissive conditions, an 11 -kDa protein reactive with antiserum raised to a previously described DNA-binding phosphoprotein (S. Y. Kao and W. R. Bauer, Virology 159 : 399 - 407, 1987) was not synthesized, indicating that the latter is the product of the F 18 R gene. In the absence of IPTG, replication of viral DNA and the subsequent resolution of concatemeric DNA molecules appeared normal. Omission of IPTG did not alter the kinetics of early and late viral protein synthesis, although the absence of the 11 -kDa polypeptide was noted by labeling infected cells with [35 S]methionine or [32 P]phosphate. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that proteolytic processing of the major viral structural proteins, P 4 a and P 4 b, was inhibited under nonpermissive conditions, suggesting a block in virus maturation. Without addition of IPTG, the failure of virus particle formation was indicated by sucrose gradient centrifugation of infected cell lysates and by the absence of vaccinia virus-mediated pH-dependent cell fusion. Electron microscopic examination of infected cells revealed that immature virus particles, with aberrant internal structures, accumulated when synthesis of the 11 -kDa DNA-binding protein was prevented...|$|E
40|$|ABM 508 is a {{recombinant}} {{fusion protein}} {{consisting of the}} N-terminal 485 amino acids of diphtheria toxin joined to alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone. When expressed in Escherichia coli {{under the control of}} the tox promoter and signal sequence, ABM 508 is severely degraded. When overexpressed from a thermoinducible lambda pR promoter fusion, ABM 508 is largely insoluble. We compared the expression of ABM 508 (501 amino acids) to a full-length mutant form of the toxin (CRM 197; 535 amino acids) and found that CRM 197 showed minimal proteolysis. Thus, the removal of the C-terminal 50 amino acids of the toxin destabilizes the protein, making it a target for proteases. Proteolysis of ABM 508 could be reduced by removal of the tox signal sequence (thereby directing the protein to the cytoplasm) and growth in lon and htpR mutant strains of E. coli. We also showed that the solubility of tox gene products expressed in E. coli was directly related to the growth temperature of the culture. Thus, a fragment A fusion protein (223 amino acids), ABM 508, and CRM 197 were found in soluble extracts when expressed at 30 degrees C but could not be released by the same procedures after growth at 42 degrees C. On the basis of these observations, we fused the coding sequences for mature ABM 508 to the trc promoter (inducible at 30 degrees C by <b>isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside)</b> and expressed this construct in a lon htpR strain of E. coli. This plasmid made 10 mg of soluble tox protein per liter of culture (7. 7 % of the total cell protein) or 14 times more than our previous maximal level. Extracts from lon htpR cells harboring this plasmid had high levels of ADP-ribosyltransferase activity, and although proteolysis still occurred, the major tox product corresponded to full-length ABM 508...|$|E

To improve the dynamic range of such an inducible system, we have investigated the effects of combining the relief by <b>isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside</b> (IPTG) of negative control by the lac system with positive induction by the natural inducers glucocorticoids and cadmium ion for a system based on the human metallothionein-IIA gene promoter. We used the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene as a reporter gene and inserted a lacO sequence into the promoter between the GC box and metal-responsive element 1, between metal-responsive element 1 and the TATA box, or between the TATA box and the transcription start site. Surprisingly, all of these insertions had a significant inhibitory effect on promoter activity {{even in the absence of}} repressor. However, with these lacO-containing constructs, the levels of gene expression after induction by glucocorticoid, Cd 2 +, or both were considerably reduced in cells engineered to express the lac repressor. Derepression by IPTG, coupled with induction by both dexamethasone and Cd 2 + ion, then provided a high level of induced expression, i. e., by a factor of approximately 100 over the basal level of expression. However, inserting the lacO sequence well upstream just before the glucocorticoid-responsive element had much smaller effects on expression levels in both repressor-negative and repressor-positive cells. This study describes a new, high-level-inducible promoter system for gene transfer experiments.

40|$|The {{vaccinia virus}} (VV) A 17 L gene encodes a 21 - to 23 -kDa virion {{component}} that forms a stable complex with the 14 -kDa envelope protein (A 27 L gene). In a previous report, we described {{the construction of}} a VV recombinant, VVindA 17 L, in which the expression of the A 17 L gene is inducibly regulated by <b>isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside</b> (IPTG). We demonstrated that shutoff of the A 17 L gene results in a blockade of virion morphogenesis at a very early stage (D. Rodríguez, M. Esteban, and J. R. Rodríguez, J. Virol. 69 : 4640 - 4648, 1995). In the present study, we show that virus growth is restored if the inducer is provided not later than 6 h postinfection. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy analysis of VVindA 17 L-infected cells revealed that {{in the absence of the}} 21 - to 23 -kDa protein, the 14 -kDa protein is distributed throughout the cytoplasm. After IPTG addition, the 14 -kDa protein can be detected around viral factories and immature virions; at later times, it localizes in the external membranes of intracellular mature virions. Immunoelectron microscopy with anti- 21 - to 23 -kDa antibodies showed that soon after induction, the protein accumulates in membranes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and in the nuclear envelope. With time, the protein localizes in viral crescents and subsequently associates to the membranes of immature and intracellular mature virions. These results are consistent with a model in which the 21 - to 23 -kDa protein would be synthesized at the endoplasmic reticulum, from where the protein could be translocated to the membranes of the intermediate compartment to generate the precursors of the viral membranes. Also, these results argue that 14 -kDa envelope protein becomes posttranslationally associated to viral membranes through its interaction with the 21 -kDa protein...|$|E
40|$|Natural and and {{synthetic}} steroid hormones excreted {{into the environment}} are potentially threatening the population dynamics {{of all kinds of}} animals and public health. We have previously isolated a steroid degrading bacterial strain (H 5) from the Baltic Sea. at Kiel, Germany. 16 S-rRNA analysis showed that bacterial strain H 5 belongs to the genus Vibrio, family Vibrionaceae and class Gamma-Proteobacteria. Bacterial strain H 5 can degrade steroids such as testosterone and estrogens, which was shown in this study by determining the (3) H labeled steroid retaining in the bacterial H 5 culture medium at incubation times of 5 h and 20 h. Since 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/carbonyl reductase (3 alpha-HSD/CR) is a key enzyme in adaptive steroid degradation in Comamonas testosteroni (C. testosteroni), in previous investigations, a meta-genomic system with the 3 alpha-HSD/CR gene as a positive control was established. By this meta-genomic system, two estradiol inducible genes coding 3 -ketosteroid-delta- 1 -dehydrogenase and carboxylesterase, respectively, which are involved in steroid degradation, were found in marine strain H 5. In the present work, the 3 -ketosteroid-delta- 1 -dehydrogenase and carboxylesterase genes were subcloned into plasmids pET 38 - 12 and pET 24 - 17, respectively. Overexpression in Escherichia coli (E. coil) strain BL 21 (DE 3) pLysS cells resulted in corresponding proteins with an N-terminal His-tag sequence. After induction with <b>isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside,</b> 3 -ketosteroid-delta- 1 -dehydrogenase and carboxylesterase were purified in one step using nickel-chelate chromatography. After protein determination, 3 -ketosteroid-delta- 1 -dehydrogenase (0. 48 mg/ml) and carboxylesterase (1. 28 mg/ml) were used to prepare antibodies to determine steroid binding specificity in future research. In summary, we have shown that the marine strain H 5 could metabolize steroids: have isolated two estradiol inducible genes from strain H 5 chromosomal DNA, and purified the corresponding proteins for further research. The exact characterization and systematic classification of the marine steroid degrading bacterial strain H 5 is envisaged.

Here, we have cloned an inducible ferritin cDNA with 519 bp within the open reading frame fragment from the hepatopancreas of Aplysia juliana (AJ). The subunit sequence of the ferritin was predicted to be a polypeptide of 172 amino acids with a molecular mass of 19. 8291 kDa and an isoelectric point of 5. 01. The cDNA sequence of hepatopancreas ferritin in AJ was constructed into a pET- 32 a system for expressing its relative protein efficiently in E. coli strain BL 21, under <b>isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactoside</b> induction. The recombinant ferritin, which was further purified on a Ni-NTA resin column and digested with enterokinase, was detected as a single subunit of approximately 20 kDa mass using both SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. The secondary structure and phosphorylation sites of the deduced amino acids were predicted using both ExPASy proteomic tools and the NetPhos 2. 0 server, and the subunit space structure of the recombinant AJ ferritin (rAjFer) was built using a molecular operating environment software system. The result of in-gel digestion and identification using MALDI-TOF MS/MS showed that the recombinant protein was AjFer. ICP-MS results indicated that the rAjFer subunit could directly bind to cisplatin[cis-Diaminedichloroplatinum(CDDP) ], giving approximately 17. 6 CDDP/ferritin subunits and forming a novel CDDP-subunit. This suggests that a nanometer CDDP core-ferritin was constructed, which could be developed as a new anti-cancer drug. The flow cytometry results indicated that CDDP-rAjFer could induce Hela cell apoptosis. Results of the real-time PCR and Western blotting showed that the expression of AjFer mRNA was up-regulated in AJ under Cd 2 + stress. The recombinant AjFer protein should prove to be useful for further study of the structure and function of ferritin in Aplysia. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

40|$|Ferritin, {{the iron}} storage protein, {{plays a key}} role in iron metabolism. Here, we have cloned an {{inducible}} ferritin cDNA with 516 bp within the open reading frame fragment from the visceral mass of Saccostrea cucullata. The subunit sequence of the ferritin was predicted to be a polypeptide of 171 amino acids with a molecular weight (MW) of 19. 9182 kDa and an isoelectric point of 5. 24. The cDNA sequence of S. cucullata ferritin was constructed into a pET- 32 a expression system for expressing its relative protein efficiently in the Escherichia coli BL 21 strain under <b>isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside</b> (IPTG) induction. The recombinant ferritin, which was further purified on a Ni-NTA resin column and digested with enterokinase, was detected as a single subunit of approximately MW 20 kDa using both SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. S. cucullata ferritin (ScFer) showed 98 % identity with Crassostrea gigas ferritin at the amino acid level. The secondary structure and phosphorylation sites of deduced amino acids were predicted with ExPASy proteomics tools and the NetPhos 2. 0 server, respectively, and the subunit space structure of recombinant S. cucullata ferritin (rScFer) was built using the molecular operating environmental software system. The results of both in-gel digestion and identification using MALDI-TOF MS/MS showed that the recombinant protein was ScFer. ICP-MS indicated that rScFer subunit can directly bind to cisplatin[cis-Diaminedichloroplatinum(CDDP) ], giving approximately 22. 9 CDDP/ferritin subunit for forming a novel complex of CDDP-subunit, which suggests that it constructs a nanometer CDDP core-ferritin for developing a new drug of anti-cancer. The results of both the real-time PCR and Western blotting showed that the expression of ScFer mRNA was up-regulated in the oyster under the stress of Cd(2 +). In addition, the expression increment of ScFer mRNA under bacterial challenge indicated that ferritin participated in the immune response of S. cucullata. The recombinant ScFer should prove to be useful for further study of the structure and function of ferritin in S. cucullata. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
