25|$|The {{design of}} the man-carrying machine known as a Rotachute, {{also known as a}} Hafner H.8, evolved from November 1940 and {{throughout}} 1941. In September 1941, the Central Landing Establishment was renamed the Airborne Forces Establishment. The Rotachute Mark I design initially comprised a tubular steel framework with a single seat, rubber-mounted rotor hub, hanging control column, skid undercarriage, and a self-inflating rear fairing made of rubberised fabric with integral tailplane. The two rotor blades, of wooden construction, could achieve flapping and coning characteristics via hinges on the rotor hub. Fixed <b>footrests</b> were provided, plus fittings below the seat to accommodate a soldier's weapon, such as a Bren gun. The control column offered two-axis control, rolling and pitching, with turns made via controlled rolling movement. Air Ministry Specification No. 11/42 was issued retrospectively to describe the outline requirements. The Ministry of Aircraft Production sub-contracted construction of parts to specialist firms including F. Hills and Sons, Airwork General Trading, Dynaflex, Dunlop, and H. Morris & Co. Some full size rotor trials were carried out using a pivoting rig mounted on a Ford flatbed truck, and full-size unmanned airframes were used in ground-based and inflight trials.|$|E

There are overhead luggage racks {{on the upper}} level and a luggage storage area on the lower level across from the stairs. There are four unisex toilets per coach, all on the lower level. A shower was included in the original design, with the proviso that it be locked when the coaches were used in short-haul service. It was deleted from the final design. After a grade crossing accident in 1999 the Transportation Safety Board of Canada faulted the layout on the lower level; the exterior door, when opened and locked in position, prevented egress from the wheelchair-accessible bathroom.|$|E

2500|$|While {{with the}} T.I.

[...] The user would have to {{jump up and down}} to 'establish a forward drive to wheels through a free-wheel device'. More successful was his invention of an exercising machine [...] consisting of 'a flywheel rotatably mounted in fixed bearings, a winding spool fixed to rotate with the flywheel and a cable one end of which is connected to the core of the spool {{in such a way that}} on rotation of the flywheel with the cable fully unwound, the cable winds onto the spool in one or other direction depending on the direction of rotation of the flywheel.' From the patent it can be seen that this was the principle used for rowing machines and exercise equipment.|$|E
2500|$|Older {{economy class}} seats are {{available}} on one un-refitted Boeing 777-200 and one un-refitted Boeing 777-200ER.

Baby bassinets are available at some bulkheads. These older Economy Class seats with the Wisemen 3000 system were introduced with the Boeing 777-200ER in 1997, for use alongside the existing Economy Class seats with the non-AVOD KrisWorld (at that time on board the airline's Boeing 747-400s and A340-300s, having been introduced in 1995) and the older-generation early 1990s seats without KrisWorld (at that time on board the airline's A310-200s and A310-300s). The first few aircraft were delivered without AVOD, as of 2015, {{there are no more}} aircraft without AVOD. After the first Boeing 777-200ER was delivered on 5 May 1997, this Economy Class seat was installed in all subsequent aircraft deliveries (including newer -SP* series Boeing 747-400s), as well as in refitted existing Boeing 747-400s in late 1997 and early 1998.|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} MQP was {{to design}} an energy {{absorbing}} bumper system that can protect the feet of a wheelchair user when the user is participating in contact sports or any other activities that involve contact between the wheelchair and its surroundings. Wheelchair users are able to play sports in existing powered wheelchairs that can weigh up to 300 lbs and travel at speeds up to 7 mph. However, a collision between a wheelchair traveling at these speeds and any surrounding objects can potentially injure the user, damage the wheelchair, or damage the surroundings. The design team developed a prototype of a bumper system that could be reversibly attached to a wheelchair, which consisted of two components, a modified <b>footrest</b> hanger and an integrated footbox. The <b>footrest</b> hanger is shaped like a parallelogram and includes a <b>footrest</b> and an energy absorbing element. When the user’s feet are placed on the <b>footrest,</b> the parallelogram deforms and the energy absorbing element compresses. The footbox contains an impact barrier and allows for lateral and frontal movement of the <b>footrest.</b> Static tests and impact tests were conducted {{to ensure that the}} bumper system could withstand the appropriate forces and strains. The evaluation of the bumper system indicated that when the bumper system was used in conjunction with the wheelchair, collisions during contact sports reduce the impact on the user and minimize damage to the wheelchair...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWork {{presented}} in this paper discusses the effect of knee angle, during the block phase of the start, on overall start performance using the Omega OSB 11 block. Omega claims that the <b>footrest</b> enables the athlete to push-off with a rear knee angle of 90 °, which is beneficial to starting performance. Published work to date supports the positive effect of starting performance using the <b>footrest,</b> compared to blocks without a <b>footrest,</b> however, reference is not specifically made to the knee angle of the athlete beyond set-up. Ten male, national-level, sprint swimmers were asked to perform maximal start trials using three different <b>footrest</b> configurations. Force and video data were collected for each trial at a rate of 125 Hz. Analysis of the data focused on the effect of knee angle at set-up, on horizontal and vertical peak forces. For these data the best starts produced a peak vertical force at a rear knee angle of 80 °- 90 °. More interestingly, this study suggests that, for the best starts, peak horizontal force production occurred with an obtuse knee angle of 100 °- 110 °...|$|R

2500|$|In 1953 the Imperial {{model was}} renamed the Imperial Custom. Although the Imperial Custom resembled the New Yorker, {{it had a}} {{different}} wheelbase, taillights, and side trim. Clean front fenders and higher rear fender stone shield set it apart from the [...] "ordinary" [...] Chryslers. This {{was also the first}} year for the stylized eagle hood ornament. Power brakes, power windows, center folding armrests (front and rear) and a padded dash were standard. Parking lights on all Imperials were positioned between the top and center grille moldings, a variation from the design used on other Chrysler cars. A new model was the six-passenger Imperial Custom limousine which had as standard equipment electric windows, electric division window, floor level courtesy lamps, rear compartment heater, fold-up <b>footrests,</b> seatback mounted clock and special luxury cloth or leather interiors. On March 10, 1953, the exclusive Imperial Custom Newport hardtop was added to the Imperial line at $325 over the price of the eight-passenger sedan. The 2-door Club coupe was discontinued. Imperial Custom sedans now rode on a wheelbase [...] longer than the 2-door hardtops. The eagle ornament was about the only thing new on the 1953 [...] Imperial Crown. The nameplate was changed slightly and the limousine featured moldings on top of the rear fenders. Imperial Crowns came with a 12-volt electrical system (Imperial Customs still had a 6-volt system) and Chrysler's first fully automatic transmission, called PowerFlite, became available late in the model year, being installed in a limited number of cars for testing and evaluation. Power steering was standard on Imperial Crowns. Also, 1953 was the first year that the Imperial had a one-piece windshield, instead of a two-piece one. A padded dash was standard.|$|E
