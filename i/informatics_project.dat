Found causes are then analyzed. With the help of an interview with project managers and according to the authors of technical literature, necessary measures are proposed in order to eliminate the most common causes of problems in <b>informatics</b> <b>projects.</b> These measures are then further evaluated from the position of successful implementation in a new project methodology of the chosen financial organization. The work is therefore beneficial to the cho-sen financial organization, as well as to other organizations with similar causes of errors and also for readers with an interest in project management...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{indicate}} how Outcome Mapping (OM) can be used as a methodology to monitor and evaluate a specific developmental <b>informatics</b> <b>project</b> currently under way in the Meraka Institute. OM was applied in the Broadband for All (BB 4 All) wireless mesh network project which focuses on the provision of broadband to selected citizens/rural communities in South Africa, funded by the Department of Science and Technology (DST). In this project the main focus is the deployment of broadband connectivity in and around selected schools and other government centres such as clinics, Thusong Centres (multipurpose community service centres) and community libraries. Selected areas include Nkangala, Sekhukhune and John Taolo Gaetsewe (Kgalagadi) districts. OM was mainly applied as a monitoring and evaluation framework during the initial/planning phase through to the implementation phase of the project. The result of the usage of this methodology indicated that it can support any development <b>informatics</b> <b>project</b> if applied from the beginning. Detailed feedback from all stakeholders in the project proved to be the major challenge and specific changes in behaviour were documented from the project team right through to the Village Operators in the identified rural areas. This article will also outline what unexpected results and lessons were learnt from specific groups involved in the project...|$|E
