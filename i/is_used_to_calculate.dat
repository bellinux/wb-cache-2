40|$|Natural {{convection}} heat transfer correlations are {{usually in the}} form Nusselt{Rayleigh}, and occasionally in the form Nusselt{Rayleigh*}. Both forms are inconvenient because they oftentimes require indirect solution: - When Nusselt{Rayleigh} correlations <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>calculate</b> heat flux, solution is simple and direct. But when they <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>calculate</b> boundary layer temperature difference, solution must be indirect-i. e. {{must be based on}} an indirect method such as iteration or trial-and-error. - When Nusselt{Rayleigh*} correlations <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>calculate</b> boundary layer temperature difference, solution is direct. But when they <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>calculate</b> heat flux, solution must be indirect. This manuscript describes an improved form for natural {{convection heat}} transfer correlations. The improved form allows direct solution for heat flux and for boundary layer temperature difference...|$|R
5|$|Dew {{point is}} the {{temperature}} to which a given parcel of air must be cooled, at constant atmospheric pressure, for water vapor to condense into water. The condensed water is called dew. The dew point is a saturation point. When the dew point temperature falls below freezing {{it is called the}} frost point, as the water vapor no longer creates dew but instead creates frost or hoarfrost by deposition. The dew point is associated with relative humidity. A high relative humidity indicates that the dew point is closer to the current air temperature. If the relative humidity is 100%, the dew point is equal to the current temperature. Given a constant dew point, an increase in temperature will lead to a decrease in relative humidity. At a given barometric pressure, independent of temperature, the dew point determines the specific humidity of the air. The dew point is an important statistic for general aviation pilots, as it <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>calculate</b> the likelihood of carburetor icing and fog. When used with the air temperature, a formula can be used to estimate the height of cumuliform, or convective, clouds.|$|E

The first buffer is then written to its line and freed to hold the successor state for the third line.
