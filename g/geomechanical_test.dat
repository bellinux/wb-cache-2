40|$|A large {{laboratory}} research project founded, by the European Community and involving Academies and Industry {{has been carried}} out to fill the gap between the empirical design rules of soil treatment by lime and the mechanistic design approach used for transportation infrastructures. This required a multidisciplinary approach both at macro/micro-scales, using common <b>geomechanical</b> <b>test</b> methods, microscope observations and micro scale tests. These tests were performed on samples of a silty soil that had been treated with respectively 1. 5, 3 and 4. 5 % calcic quicklime. The curing conditions were chosen as main parameters for the testing program, viz. time (up to 730 days) and temperature (20, 36 and 50 °C). Due to a lack of space, only results with samples cured at 20 °C are presented in this paper. All evolutions of the mechanical parameters were coupled to the micro-scale test results. The aim of this analysis was to gain a better insight in the relation between strength macro-scale parameters and micro-scale reactions such as the development of CSH and CAH during pozzolanic reactions. © 2011 ASCE.

40|$|It is {{standard}} and critical {{practice in the}} majority of geotechnical engineering applications to use a rock mass classification system to evaluate the condition of rock in mine planning and operations. The use of geotechnical classification schemes for rock mass characterisation in underground coal mines is well established. Several rock mass classification systems have been developed and used in civil engineering design and for underground mining operations. In the past, these rock mass classification systems were modified and used in the coal mining industry to quantify descriptive geological information for use in coal mine design and roof support selection. To facilitate geotechnical evaluations, mining companies in the Bowen Basin of central Queensland put considerable effort into obtaining geomechanical data from surface exploration boreholes and borecore. The advance or innovation in the proposed method is not in doing the characterisations, but the method of evaluating the required parameters from available borehole geophysics and <b>geomechanical</b> <b>test</b> data. Evaluating radial point-load strength from geophysical correlations is dependent on collating a large comprehensive database of actual point-load test data across the range of lithological types...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine {{cracking}} and instability of the high and steep left bank slope with weak rock mass structures, and effectiveness of the reinforcements designed for the slope at the Jinping hydroelectricity power station, southwestern China. A new <b>geomechanical</b> model <b>testing</b> method is first proposed for evaluating slope safety factors. In the proposed <b>geomechanical</b> model <b>test,</b> the slope is constructed on a flat testing bed, which can be rotated by hydraulic lifts. By increasing the rotation angle of the testing bed, the forces tending to induce the sliding of the slope are increased, which may cause crack initiation and propagation in the slope and result in rock mass slippage. Thus, through the proposed <b>geomechanical</b> model <b>test,</b> the slope failure mechanism, progressive failure process and final failure pattern can be studied. Moreover, the stability safety factors can be evaluated according to displacement data monitored by sensors installed in the geomechanical model. The <b>geomechanical</b> model <b>test</b> of the Jinping left-bank slope reveals that the bending and toppling cracks occur simultaneously in the unreinforced zone of the slope together with strong relaxation and tension cracks. It is found that the factor controlling the rock mass failure and instability is the structurally weak rock mass and the dominant failure mode is the integral catastrophic instability mode, in which the slope energy is totally dissipated and the slope destabilizes at a limit state. The reinforcement installed in the large area above the elevation of the dam-slope abutment and the unloading action due to the excavation of rocks lying above the dam platform have effectively improved the anti-slide safety factor of the slope, and thus increased its inherent safety factor. On the basis of the <b>geomechanical</b> model <b>testing</b> results and their comparisons with field monitoring results, it is concluded that the installed rock bolts and long anchor reinforcement measures are very effective in keeping the cracks closed in the rock mass and maintaining the slope stability...|$|R

The testing needs are derived from 10 CFR 60 regulations and simple thermomechanical canister- and room-scale numerical studies. The testing approach suggested is based on an ``iterative`` procedure of full-scale testing combined with numerical and empirical modeling. The testing suggested is based heavily on demonstration of excavation and thermal loading of full-scale repository excavations. Numerical and/or empirical models are compared to the full-scale response, allowing for adjustment of the model and evaluation of confidence in their predictive ability. Additional testing may be specified if confidence in prediction of the rock mass response is low. It is suggested that extensive drifting be conducted within the proposed repository area, including exploration of the bounding Drill Hole Wash and Imbricate fault structures, as well as the Ghost Dance fault.

40|$|AbstractHydropower {{projects}} are rapidly developing in China at present, {{and a number}} of high dams and large reservoirs are currently under construction or will soon be built. These large {{projects are}} mainly located on the great rivers in West China with complicated topographical and geological conditions. Evaluation of stability and safety of these high dam projects is an important topic. <b>Geomechanical</b> model <b>test</b> {{is one of the main}} methods to study the global stability of high dam and foundation. In this paper, a comprehensive testing method that combines overloading and strength reduction in a model is proposed. In this method, both the influence of excessive flooding and the effects of strength reduction of rock masses and weak structural planes on dam stability are considered. Thus, the comprehensive testing method can accurately incorporate multiple factors that affect the global stability of high dam and its foundation. Based on the failure testing principle and model similarity theory, a similarity relation formula for safety evaluation through comprehensive test is established. A new model material, temperature-dependent analogous material, is also developed. By rising the temperature and reducing the strength of the model material, the mechanical behaviors resulting from gradual strength reduction can be simulated. Thus, the comprehensive testing method is realized in a single model.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} is to characterize the risk of carbon sequestration under downhole conditions with regards to wellbore cement integrity. The primary research objective was to understand the geochemical interactions of simulated sequestration brines and wellbore cement. There are four key focuses of this study with regards to cement interaction: 1) Simulated brines saturated with Supercritical CO 2 and CO 2 -O 2; 2) Adjacent formation host rock under sequestration conditions; 3) Geochemical modeling using CHIM-XPT based on the experimental studies of points 1) and 2) above; 4) <b>Geomechanical</b> strength <b>tests</b> of CO 2 exposed cements. First, the interaction of cement with supercritical CO 2, CO 2 -saturated brines, and CO 2 -O 2 mixtures at 50 °C, 85 °C, and 28. 9 MPa was evaluated. Cement exposed to a lower salinity brine (1 M) had a larger alteration depth (1. 25 mm) compared to cement exposed to a higher salinity brine (2. 2 M) (0. 836 mm). CO 2 -O 2 exposed cements displayed alteration depths of 1. 6 mm at 85 °C and 0. 7 mm at 50 °C for 1 M. The cement exposed to the 2. 17 M solution had an alteration extending 1. 685 mm. The second focus studied the influence of adjacent formations and observed mineral trapping in the Grande Ronde Basalt-cement. Studies of Mt. Simon Sandstone-cement interaction provided evidence for high CO 2 storage capacity. The third focus is geochemical modeling using CHIM-XPT. Pure CO 2 saturated brines yielded a pH of 3. 0 at 1 M and 3. 85 at 2. 17 M. The CO 2 -O 2 gas run calculated a pH of 3. 96 at 1 M and 3. 85 at 2. 17 M. The Pasco solution after exposure had a pH of 6. 97 and an estimated dissolved 161 g of CO 2 (g). The pH of the Illinois Basin brine and Mt.

40|$|Approximately {{one-third of}} {{anthropogenic}} CO 2 emissions arises from transport, one-third from industrial and domestic sources, and one-third from power generation. While achieving substantial reductions in emissions from {{either of the}} first two will be a long-term process, the technology to capture CO 2 from power plants is available and could lead quickly to significant reductions in emissions—provided mechanisms are available to dispose of the CO 2 thus captured. The capture and underground storage of industrial quantities of carbon dioxide is currently being demonstrated at the Sleipner West gas field in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. Natural CO 2 accumulations offer the potential to understand the long-term geological processes involved in CO 2 sequestration. By identifying the effects of CO 2 on rock properties, such as changes in permeability and porosity or rock strength, models can be corroborated against empirical data. This can build {{confidence in their ability to}} predict likely responses of reservoirs and cap-rocks to geological sequestration.

However, numerical groundwater models of underground excavations typically assume a constant literature value of Ss. Our research used both in situ and laboratory obtained data. High frequency pore pressure data was evaluated to understand the variability and changes in Ss within sedimentary strata overlying a longwall coal mine. Pore pressure data from a vertical series of 6 vibrating wire piezometers (50 to ~ 278 m depth) recording at hourly intervals used barometric pressure loading for the period before and during mining. The site was located near the centre of a longwall panel that extracted coal {{at a depth of}} 300 - 400 m. The data was processed to calculate loading efficiency and Ss values by multi-method analyses of barometric and earth tide responses. In situ Ss results varied over one to two orders of magnitude and indicated that Ss was changing before and after extraction of underlying coal seams. Laboratory <b>geomechanical</b> <b>tests</b> were undertaken to compare with in situ findings. The vertical leakage of groundwater within the constrained zone (~ 10 to ~ 150 m depth) was found to be limited before mining, although some degree of vertical hydraulic connectivity was observed. Depressurization was evident in the fractured zone directly overlying the coal seam, and Ss changes at ~ 250 m depth indicated this confined aquifer may have became unconfined, while other zones remained confined. Our results demonstrate that high frequency pore pressure data can provide realistic time series Ss values. We have shown, for the first time, that variability of Ss can be significant, and that these changes can provide important insights into how shallow and deep groundwater systems respond to underground mining...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{and other}} {{aggregated}} or structured soils present peculiar mechanical behaviour which differs, in some parts, from the behaviour of soils reconstituted in laboratory. This difference {{can be explained}} by a specific structure which gathers the particles arrangement and bonding. However, numerous constitutive models were originally based on the behaviour of reconstituted soils. Therefore, classical models should be extended in order to reproduce more complex features of behaviour linked to the soil structure. This work provides a general framework to describe and predict the behaviour of aggregated and reconstituted soils. A multi-scale study was performed to understand the effect of the structure and its evolution upon loading. From an experimental point of view, a preliminary review of literature has been completed by an experimental program carried out on a silty soil in which different structures have been generated by various compaction conditions. At the macro-scale, conventional mechanical tests evidence the overconsolidation effect induced by structure and the important compressibility during its degradation. At the micro-scale, the fabric evolution during the destructuration process (induced by saturation and loading) has been mainly quantified by the evolution of the pore size distribution. This characterisation has been done by Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry. The samples compacted on the dry side of optimum exhibit a double porosity characterized by a bimodal pore size distribution, by opposition to the samples compacted on wet side of optimum that show a single class of pores. The deformation induced by mechanical loading is related to the closure of the biggest pores and the pore size distribution of aggregated soils tends towards unimodal shape upon the destructuration process. A constitutive critical state model (ACMEG) has been extended, based on experimental observations, in order to reproduce the behaviours of aggregated and reconstituted soils. In this purpose, a structure variable has been introduced in the yield function and its evolution has been integrated in the hardening law. Explicit and implicit methods of integration have been discussed and implemented to reproduce stress-strain responses on <b>geomechanical</b> <b>tests</b> (oedometric, isotropic and triaxial compression tests). Finally, the model has been validated by comparison of model predictions with the experimental results. Doctorat en Sciences de l'ingénieur et technologieinfo:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|R

It {{is hoped}} that the tool will be made {{a part of the}} physical/urban planning process when used by engineers and planners and used to address risks posed by landslides given the rapidly increasing concentration of population and the development of infrastructure and industry in the Baguio area. Reports and studies of individual landslides in the area are reviewed in order to discover the causal factors of mass movements and their interactions. The findings of these research works are discussed in the first portion of this paper. A description of the LANDSLIDE RISK RATING SYSTEM, remedial measures, and recommendations form the rest of the paper. This SYSTEM integrates different hazard (bedrock geology, slope gradients, vegetation) and risk (population, land use) factors. The selection of hazard factors takes into account the results of the analysis of causal factors of mass movements in the area. This analysis is based on the specific attributes of the subject study area, namely: a relatively extreme topographic relief, variable bedrock geology, and no significant differences in rainfall from one zone to another. The study assumes that the entire Greater Baguio area is subject to a uniform amount of rainfall during any given precipitation event. Although this study is area-specific it can have wider application. (cont.) Finally, the paper recommends that in future research work on this subject matter, soil and rock samples from various slopes be subjected to <b>geomechanical</b> <b>testing</b> to facilitate a mathematical analysis of slope failures. This can be the basis for a comprehensive database which can be used to create a Landslide Hazard Map where each slope in the Greater Baguio area can be rated.

Test results indicated that the substitution of quartz sand by barite sand had no apparent influence on the uniaxial compressive strength and elastic modulus of the specimens but can increase the bulk density, according to the proportional coarse aggregate content. An ideal linearity was found in the relationship between the barite sand substitution ratio and the bulk density. The relationship between the bulk density and the usage of coarse aggregate and barite sand was also presented. The test results provided an insight into the bulk density adjustment of resin-based equivalent materials...|$|R

40|$|The {{stability}} {{of a large}} cavern group at great depth is discussed {{on the basis of}} large-scale three-dimensional (3 -D) <b>geomechanical</b> model <b>tests</b> and numerical simulations. The model tests are described in detail. Improvements in the tests were made in terms of experimental techniques and advanced measurement methods. The model tests utilized active loading on six sides of a rock mass in a true 3 -D stress state. During the model construction, precast blocks were fabricated and monitoring holes were defined prior to test initiation. Newly developed combination ball-sliding walls were installed on each of the major loading surfaces to reduce the friction induced by model deformation. A unique grouting and installation technique employing prestressed cables was adopted in the tests. A digital photogrammetric technique, displacement sensing bars using fiber Bragg grating (FBG) technology, and mini multipoint extensometers were developed for measuring deformation. Overloading tests were then conducted for different overburden depths, and 3 -D numerical analyses were performed to simulate the testing procedures. Conclusions regarding the {{stability of}} the cavern group were developed based on a comparison between the experimental and numerical results.

40|$|AbstractShale gas {{has become}} a {{significant}} resource play in the USA {{over the past few}} years and companies are now evaluating the shale gas potential of many sedimentary basins, including several onshore basins within Australia. The renewed focus on rock sequences that have hitherto largely been ignored has necessitated the development of workflows and methods for characterising shales. Along with the deployment of new methods comes the need for interpretation frameworks in order to understand properties such as rock source quality, mechanical properties and production performance from a diverse range of measurements. Laboratory characterisation of rock properties is an important part of any resource evaluation and for shale gas, specific properties of importance include silt content, organic matter abundance and type, static and dynamic mechanical properties (brittleness), micro/macro-fabrics, porosity, permeability, petrophysical properties and anisotropy. Here we introduce a workflow for systematic shale characterisation in the laboratory with a number of examples to illustrate and discuss the application to reservoir evaluation in shale gas plays. A suite of shales from a number of sedimentary basins around the world was collected and characterised with a full suite of non-destructive petrophysical methods before destructive <b>geomechanical</b> <b>testing</b> was performed. For each sample, a representative portion was analysed for quantitative mineralogy using XRD and XRF, and clay chemical reactivity via cation exchange capacity (CEC) and grain size by centrifugation. For many samples, surface area and Mercury Injection Capillary Pressure (MICP) for porosity and pore throat distribution were also performed and used to predict permeability from models available in the literature. Several imaging techniques including Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X-ray Computed (micro-) Tomography (X-ray CT) at low and high resolution were performed. Shale strength has previously been shown to be related to CEC, which is inversely proportional to silt content. Anisotropy of shale properties is both intrinsic and stress-induced. Dielectric properties are related to water content at high frequency and dispersion in the dielectric constant is directly related to CEC of clays in particular and hence rock strength. Stress-induced anisotropy of elastic properties was found to be dependent on the orientation of microfabrics with respect to the maximum principal stress direction. Low and high field nuclear magnetic resonance can be used to distinguish clay-bound and free water as well as adsorption of organic components and to screen for wettability. High and low field NMR techniques are combined to show that illitic shales tend to be strongly water wet while the presence of kaolinitic clays imparts a tendency for shales to become oil wet with likely consequences for oil/gas recovery strategy, production flow efficiency and drilling design...|$|R
40|$|Analogue {{material}} with appropriate properties {{is of great}} importance to the reliability of <b>geomechanical</b> model <b>test,</b> {{which is one of}} the mostly used approaches in field of geotechnical research. In this paper, a new type of analogue material is developed, which is composed of coarse aggregate (quartz sand and/or barite sand), fine aggregate (barite powder), and cementitious material (anhydrous sodium silicate). The components of each raw material are the key influencing factors, which significantly affect the physical and mechanical parameters of analogue materials. In order to establish the relationship between parameters and factors, the material properties including density, Young’s modulus, uniaxial compressive strength, and tensile strength were investigated by a series of orthogonal experiments with hundreds of samples. By orthogonal regression analysis, the regression equations of each parameter were obtained based on experimental data, which can predict the properties of the developed analogue materials according to proportions. The experiments and applications indicate that sodium metasilicate cemented analogue material is a type of low-strength and low-modulus {{material with}} designable density, which is insensitive to humidity and temperature and satisfies mechanical scaling criteria for weak rock or soft geological materials. Moreover, the developed material can be easily cast into structures with complex geometry shapes and simulate the deformation and failure processes of prototype rocks...|$|R
40|$|<b>Geomechanical</b> model <b>tests</b> were {{performed}} on wet sand in a glass-walled fault rest box to investigate {{the relationship between the}} propagation of fault rupture and the shapes, and the locations of failure surface. Three CCD cameras were used to capture the process of the surface rupture development and to analyze the displacement field by using the digital speckle correlation method. Based on the experiment, it was observed that when the thrust fault moved upward, the sediment layers formed a shear zone. The smaller the angle of faults, the wider of shear zone was formed in the sediment layer. The vertical displacement and the movement velocity of the fault are greater, the deformation of sediment layer is wider, and the deformation of the soil layer is stronger. When the vertical displacement of the fault exceeds 40 % of the soil thickness, the deformed soil will form tension crack at the surface of the sediment. For a fixed sediment thickness with a fixed vertical displacement, the width of the deformation bands decreased with the increased fault movement velocity. However, the degree of deformation and failure will become more intense under a faster fault movement. Experimental results of this study on fault angle, fault movement velocity and sediment thickness is an important issue in further studies on ground deformation and failure characteristics of a thrust fault.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental study}} on rockbursts {{that occur in}} deep underground excavations. To begin with, the boundary conditions for excavation in deep underground engineering were analysed and elastic adaptive boundary is {{an effective way to}} minimize the boundary effect of <b>geomechanical</b> model <b>test.</b> Then, in order to simulate an elastic adaptive loading boundary, Belleville springs were used to establish this loading boundary. With the aforementioned experimental set-ups and fabrication of similarity models for test, the phenomena of strain mode rockbursts were satisfactorily reproduced in laboratory. The internal stress, strain, and convergences of the openings of the model were instrumented by subtly preembedded sensors and transducers. Test results showed that, with an initial state of high stress from both upper layers’ gravitational effects and in situ stress due to tectonic movements, the excavation brings a dramatic rise in the hoop stress and sharp drop in radial stress, which leads to the splitting failure of rock mass. Finally a rockburst occurred associated with the release of strain energy stored in highly stressed rock mass. In addition, the failure of the surrounding rock demonstrated an obvious hysteresis effect which supplies valuable guide and reference for tunnel support. Not only do these results provide a basis for further comprehensive experiments, but also the data can offer assisting aids for further theoretical study of rockbursts...|$|R

40|$|This work {{develops}} a backfill design procedure aimed {{to facilitate the}} optimization of an available mine material {{in order to meet}} target objectives in a particular mining role. This required the compilation and analysis of data on fill usage, established design procedures, physical and <b>geomechanical</b> properties, <b>testing</b> techniques and procedures, as well as behavioural modelling methods. A backfill classification system is proposed based upon size distribution. A series of design equations are presented which relate to this system. These equations represent the means by which backfill geomechanical behaviour can be related to physical properties. This is considered to be fundamental to an effective backfill design procedure. Derivation of the equations has been based upon analysis of data from a program of laboratory and in situ testing conducted in ten operating Canadian mines by the author, together with other published work. The in situ testing required the development of a pressuremeter testing procedure novel to underground mining. The theoretical basis for the employment of pressuremeter data has been examined and behavioral equations have been developed to describe the deformation and stress history during a backfill material test. In addition two new equations have been developed for the analysis of pressuremeter data. The in situ data collected has been correlated with laboratory derived geomechanical data for the same backfill materials. The geomechanical properties associated with the proposed backfill classifications have also been related to their influence on backfill behaviour in three mine backfill roles: free standing stability during pillar recovery in bulk mining methods; dynamic interaction with stope walls in rockburst prone ground; and ability to reduce stresses in highly stressed rock masses. This work has been based on new and established modelling methods and aims to provide insight into the effectiveness of the backfill classes in these roles of growing practical significance...|$|R
