Here {{we report on the}} Ðrst numerical simulations of jet formation in a rapidly rotating (a 0. 95) Kerr black hole magnetosphere. We study cases in which the Keplerian accretion disk is both corotating and counter-rotating with respect to the black hole rotation, and {{investigate the}} Ðrst D 50 light-crossing times. In the corotating <b>disk</b> <b>case,</b> our results are almost the same as those in Schwarzschild black hole cases: a gas pressureÈdriven jet is formed by a shock in the disk, and a weaker magnetically driven jet is also gener-ated outside the gas pressureÈdriven jet.

40|$|We discuss 2 -D MHD {{numerical}} simulations for {{the interaction}} of high-velocit y clouds with a magnetized Galactic disk. The initial magnetic field is oriented parallel to the disk, and we consider two different field topologies: parallel and perpendicular to the plane of motion of the clouds. The impinging clouds move in oblique trajectories and fall toward the plane with different initial velocities. The B-field lines are distorted and compressed during the collision, preventing the cloud from penetrating into the disk. The perturbation creates a complex, turbulent, pattern of MHD waves that induce oscillations {{on both sides of}} the plane, and can trigger the Parker instability. The field efficiently transmits the perturbation over a large volume, while acting like a shield that inhibits the mass exchange between halo and disk. For non-magnetized <b>disk</b> <b>cases,</b> the shocked layer generates a tail that oscillates, creating vorticity and turbulent flows along its trajectory...|$|R

There are five types of drives, grouped by the maximum readable capacity: 20 MB, 44 MB, 90 MB, 150 MB, and 230 MB. The interface is usually SCSI. Drives were available as either internal units, which fit into standard 5¼-inch drive bays, or as external units {{with one or two}} drives in a self-contained case connected to the host computer via external SCSI connector. The disks have a physical switch similar to that on 3½-inch standard floppy disks to enable and disable write protection.|$|R

When the fluid layer thickness is of the same order of magnitude as the boundary layer depth, the azimuthal velocity axial gradient is nearly constant and this rotating disk flow is a torsional Couette flow. As in the plane Couette flow or the cylindrical Couette flow, transition to turbulence occurs via the appearance of turbulent domains inside a laminar background.

In this paper, we establish the sharper bound 5 k 2 logk in the real interval case. We also give sharper bounds in the complex unit <b>disk</b> <b>case,</b> in particular 2 k.

40|$|The suffix tree of {{a string}} is the {{fundamental}} data structure of string processing. Recent focus on massive data sets has sparked interest in overcoming the memory bottlenecks of known algorithms for building suffix trees. Our main contribution is a new algorithm for suffix tree construction in which we choreograph almost all disk accesses to be via the sort and scan primitives. This algorithm achieves optimal results {{in a variety of}} sequential and parallel computational models. Two of our results are: In the traditional external memory model, in which only the number of disk accesses is counted, we achieve an optimal algorithm, both for single and multiple <b>disk</b> <b>cases.</b> This is the first optimal algorithm known for either model. Traditional disk page access counting does not differentiate between random page accesses and block transfers involving several consecutive pages. This difference is routinely exploited by expert programmers to get fast algorithms on real machines. We adopt a simple accounting scheme and show that our algorithm achieves the same optimal tradeoff for block versus random page accesses as the one we establish for sorting...|$|R

This technique can be applied to an occulter of generic shape, but the attention is here focused on a specific application; that is, the case of a giant space solar coronagraph, in which the occulter is located at 100 m from the telescope aperture. By means of the code developed, it has been possible to simulate the effects of various shapes of the occulter edge with the aim of analyzing in detail the best apodization for the coronagraph.
