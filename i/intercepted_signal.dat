Radio Detection Finding (RDF) was critically important during the Battle of Britain and reached a high state of maturity in early 1943 with the aid of United States institutions aiding British Research and Development under the pressures of the continuing Battle of the Atlantic during World War II when locating U-boats. One key breakthrough was marrying MIT/Raytheon developed CRT technology with pairs of RDF antennas giving a differentially derived instant bearing useful in tactical situations, enabling escorts to run down the bearing to an intercept. The U-boat command of Wolfpacks required a minimum once daily communications check-in, allowing new Hunter-Killer groups to localize U-boats tactically from April on, leading to dramatic swings in the fortunes of war in the battles between March, when the U-boats sank over 300 allied ships and [...] "Black May" [...] when the allies killed at least 44 U-boats - each without orders to exercise EMCON/radio silence.|$|E

40|$|Transcription from lawful {{interception}} is {{an important}} branch of forensic phonetics. Signals in that application context are often degraded, thus the transcript may not reflect what was really pronounced. In order to decide whether a given transcript generated from a lawful interception exercise reflects {{the views of the}} speakers instead of the transcriber’s, an objective speech intelligibility measurement method is required. Usually, the <b>intercepted</b> <b>signal</b> can be affected by both speech intrinsic distortion and background/environmental noise distortion. Unfortunately, the original clean speech is never accessible to the forensic expert, who therefore must draw his assessment from the only available, distorted, signal. Consequently, the only way to assess the level of accuracy that can be obtained in the transcription of poor recordings is to develop an objective methodology for intelligibility measurements. This paper addresses the issue by using three different objective approaches - namely the Signal-to-Noise ratio weighted with the “A” curves (S/NA), the Articulation Index (AI) and the Speech Transmission Index (STI) - to evaluate the intelligibility of a given signal. All of the three approaches were exercised with different types of noise, yielding results to be compared with speech intelligibility scores from subjective tests. The outcome gives high correlation evidence between objective measurements and subjective evaluations. Therefore, the proposed methodology is deemed rather useful to establish whether a given <b>intercepted</b> <b>signal</b> can be transcribed with sufficient reliability...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Automatic signals type {{classification}} (ASTC) is {{a technique}} for recognizing the modulation scheme of an <b>intercepted</b> <b>signal</b> and has seen increasing demand in both military and civilian. Most of previous tech-niques can identify only a few kinds of signal types. Also, usually, they request high SNR to achieve a mini-mum acceptable performance and don’t include higher order and new types of signals (e. g. QAM types). The work presented here proposes novel high performance method for identification of digital signal types. In this method it is proposed a hierarchical multiclass classifier based on support vector machine (SVM). The inputs of this classifier are higher order moments and cumulants (up to eight). Genetic algorithm (GA) is used to select the best model of SVMs {{in order to improve}} the performance. Simulation results show that proposed method can recognize a lot of digital signal types and achieves a highly probability of classification even at low signal to noise ratios (SNRs) ...|$|E
