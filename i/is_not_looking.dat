25|$|Elephant seals {{are among}} the seals that can stay on land for the longest periods of time, as they can stay dry for several {{consecutive}} weeks each year. Males arrive in the colonies earlier than the females and fight for control of harems when they arrive. Large body size confers advantages in fighting and the agonistic relationships of the bulls {{gives rise to a}} dominance hierarchy, with access to harems and activity within harems being determined by rank. The dominant bulls (“harem masters”) establish harems of several dozen females. The least successful males have no harems, but may try to copulate with a harem male's females when the male <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>looking.</b> The majority of primiparous females and a significant proportion of multiparous females mate at sea with roaming males away from harems.|$|E
25|$|Although Behn assures {{that she}} <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> to {{entertain}} her reader with {{the adventures of}} a feigned hero, she does exactly this to enhance and romanticize the stories of Oroonoko. Ramesh Mallipeddi stresses that spectacle was the main mediator for the representation of alien cultures in Restoration England. Therefore, Behn describes Oroonoko’s native beauty as a spectacle of 'beauty so transcending' that surpassed 'all those of his gloomy race'. She completely romanticizes Oroonoko’s figure by portraying him as an ideal handsome hero; however due {{to the color of}} his skin, his body is still constricted within the limits of exoticism. Oroonoko has all the qualities of an English royal, but his ebony skin and country of origin prevent him from being a reputable European citizen. Due to these foreign qualities, his Englishness is incomplete. He has the English-like education and air, but lacks the skin color and legal status. Behn uses this conflicting description of Oroonoko to infuse some European familiarity into his figure while still remaining exotic enough. She compares Oroonoko to well-known historical figures like Hannibal and Alexander and describes Oroonoko’s running, wrestling and killing of tigers and snakes. Albert J. Rivero states that this comparison to great Western conquerors and kings translates and naturalizes Oroonoko’s foreignness into familiar European narratives. These historical allusions and romantic gallant feats allowed English readers to relate this exotic character with their own Western history and narrative tradition.|$|E

25|$|Lane Pryce (Jared Harris); {{recurring}} Season 3, regular Seasons 4–5: The English {{financial officer}} installed by Sterling Cooper's new British parent company. He first {{appears in the}} first episode of Season 3. His role {{is that of a}} strict taskmaster who brings spending under control, in particular by cutting out frivolous expenses. His efforts are so successful, he is to be sent to India to enact cost-cutting measures, a move which Pryce <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> forward to after having settled in with his wife and child in New York. An unfortunate accident at work handicaps his replacement, thus allowing Pryce to keep his current position. He warms to American culture, and foresees some form of cultural and societal changes in American race relations. When the British parent company is sold at the end of Season 3, Pryce realizes he has become expendable and negotiates to become a founding partner in the new agency that Don Draper, Bert Cooper and Roger Sterling want to form. At Draper's suggestion, Pryce frees Sterling, Cooper, and Draper from their contractual non-compete clauses by firing them, then is fired himself, enabling the four of them to start their own firm. When hard times hit SCDP after Lucky Strike, their largest client, leaves them in Season 4, Pryce liquidates his portfolio in order to pay his share of the cash infusion required by the bank as collateral for a loan that keeps SCDP afloat. His finances already tight, he faces a crisis when the British Inland Revenue demand immediate payment of back taxes on the gain from the sale of his portfolio in Season 5. In order to pay the debt, Pryce secretly negotiates a $50,000 line of credit on behalf of the firm and announces to the partners that SCDP has a $50,000 profit and is able to pay bonuses. In anticipation of the bonus, Pryce forges Draper's signature on an early bonus check to himself, and views it as a 13-day loan which will be made good once the bonuses are paid. However, the partners decide to forgo their bonuses despite Pryce's pleading. In the penultimate episode of Season 5, Cooper discovers the cancelled check and confronts Draper, who in turn confronts Pryce, demanding his resignation. That weekend, Pryce types out a resignation letter and hangs himself in his office.|$|E

2500|$|In the London Review of Books, Amit Chaudhuri {{praised the}} book: [...] "Hitchens's {{investigations}} {{have been a}} solitary and courageous endeavour. The book is extremely well-written, with a sanity and sympathy that tempers its irony." [...] He commented that the portrait [...] "is in danger of assuming the one-dimensionality of the Mother Teresa of her admirers", and that he finished the book without much more of {{an idea of the}} character and motivations of Mother Teresa. In The New York Times Bruno Maddox wrote: [...] "Like all good pamphlets... it is very short, zealously over-written and rails wild". He called its arguments [...] "rather convincing", made [...] "with consummate style." [...] The Sunday Times said: [...] "A dirty job but someone had to do it.

2500|$|It {{is thought}} that the couple are already married because of the woman's headdress. A non-married woman would have her hair down, {{according}} to Margaret Carroll. The placement of the two figures suggests conventional 15th century views of marriage and gender roles – the woman stands near the bed and well into the room, symbolic of her role as the caretaker of the house, whereas Giovanni stands near the open window, symbolic of {{his role in the}} outside world. [...] Arnolfini looks directly out at the viewer, his wife gazes obediently at her husband. His hand is vertically raised, representing his commanding position of authority, whilst she has her hand in a lower, horizontal, more submissive pose. However, her gaze at her husband can also show her equality to him because she <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> down at the floor as lower class women would. They are part of the Burgundian court life and in that system she is his equal, not his subordinate.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1966 Midwest Regional Finals, Kansas, {{the favored}} team to face Kentucky, played Texas Western. Texas Western got a {{controversial}} double overtime victory, 81–80. The would-be winning shot, a 35-footer, {{at the buzzer}} was made by All-American Jo Jo White {{at the end of}} the first overtime, but White was called for stepping on the sideline, ironically being penalized for being too far away from the basket and the shot was negated. [...] This has always been highly contested and a [...] of the play shows his heel over the line but not on the floor. [...] Being the only piece of impartial evidence, it is impossible to tell whether his heel came up from the line prior to the photo, or whether his heel dropped to the line following the photo. [...] Also noted in the photograph is the fact that the referee <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> at his foot. [...] This supports Ted Owens' objection that the call was made late, if the ref did not see his foot until after the shot. [...] The Kansas players were celebrating when they were told the game was going to a 2nd overtime. Regardless of what actually happened, Texas Western was given the victory and advanced to the Final Four. [...] The game is immortalized in the 2006 film Glory Road which is based on that season's Texas Western team.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first season}} premiere episode shows Jules while she {{examines}} her naked {{body in the}} mirror for signs of aging. Jules, now divorced from her husband Bobby, tries to re-enter the dating world and relate to her young assistant Laurie. Jules' best friend and neighbor Ellie tries to prevent her from going out while her son is constantly being embarrassed by both of his parents. The show was originally about older women ("cougars") dating younger men, as Jules begins dating Josh (Nick Zano) and Barb is often seen [...] "hunting". Jules' relationship with Josh ends when he tells her that he loves her and Jules does not feel the same way. Later Jules begins a relationship with Jeff (Scott Foley) a client who infuriates Jules with his indecision. Her relationship with Jeff ends when the relationship becomes too serious for Jules who <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> for anything too serious so soon after her divorce, whereas Jeff is ready to settle down {{as he has been}} [...] "playing the field" [...] for a long time. After her relationship with Jeff ends, Jules falls into bed with her ex-husband Bobby (Brian Van Holt). This causes Bobby's feelings for Jules to stir even more and he later tells her that he wants her back. Jules, however, tells him that she loves him but [...] "not that way any more" [...] and that their happy ending is them as friends, raising their son Travis (Dan Byrd) together. Toward the end of the season, the simmering feelings between Jules and neighbor Grayson (Josh Hopkins) boil to the surface, and the two begin a relationship.|$|E
