40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} clinical {{needs in}} non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and review {{the potential of}} apaziquone in this respect. METHODS: Epidemiology and clinical practice in NMIBC, {{as well as new}} drugs and strategies are reviewed. RESULTS: Bladder cancer is a heterogeneous and frequent disease. Clinical risk factors help in determining additional therapy after initial resection. However, current treatments have clear limitations with regard to efficacy and/or toxicity. New drugs and strategies have been tested recently and are in (pre) clinical use. Intravesical apaziquone (EOquin) is a new drug. It has theoretical advantages for <b>intravesical</b> <b>use,</b> has proven safety and is presently under further clinical evaluation.

A study looking at 17 cases of both chemotherapy- and radiation-induced cystitis histologically characterized the cystitis as epithelial proliferation within the lamina propria with mild to moderate nuclear pleomorphism without mitoses. Pseudoinvasive urothelial nests wrapping around vessels, haemorrhage, fibrin, deposition, and acute and chronic inflammation were also present in all cases. All patients presented with hematuria with the presentation of symptoms occurring anywhere from mid-chemotherapy treatment to as far as 60  days following treatment cessation in patients with chemotherapy-induced cystitis. All patients available for follow-up at 9  months had an improvement in their hematuria and 71  % had negative cystoscopies at this time. No patients went on to develop bladder cancer [34].

40|$|Introduction: Nonmuscle {{invasive}} {{urothelial cell}} carcinoma {{is the most}} frequent malignancy of the urinary bladder. The high recurrence rate (up to 80 %) and risk of progression (up to 30 %) reflect the need for long-term follow-up and sometimes multiple interventions. To reduce the rate of recurrences and tumor progression, intravesical immunotherapy, especially the use of Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), represents the gold standard adjuvant treatment of high-risk nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). This article reviews the role of BCG therapy and several promising new immunotherapeutic approaches such as mycobacterium phlei cell wall-nucleic acid complex, interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) antibody, vaccine-based therapy, alpha-emitter therapy, and photodynamic therapy checkpoint inhibitors. Methods: A systematic literature review was performed using the terms (immunotherapy, NMIBC, BCG, and <b>intravesical)</b> <b>using</b> PubMed and Cochrane databases. Results: BCG represents the most common intravesical immunotherapeutic agent for the adjuvant treatment of high-risk NMIBC. Its use {{is associated with a}} significant reduction of recurrence and progression. Patients with NMIBC of intermediate and high-risk benefit the most from BCG therapy. To achieve maximal efficacy, an induction therapy followed by a maintenance schedule should be used. Full-dose BCG is recommended to obtain ideal antitumoral activity and {{there is no evidence of}} a reduction of side effects in patients treated with a reduced dose. There are multiple new approaches and agents in immunotherapy with potential and promising antineoplastic effects. Conclusions: The beneficial effect of BCG is well documented and established. To reduce the tumor specific mortality, it is essential to follow guideline-based treatment. In patients with BCG-failure, there are new promising alternatives other than BCG but BCG remains the gold standard at this stage...|$|R

40|$|The {{incidence}} of urinary incontinence and overactive bladder problems {{will continue to}} grow as the population ages. Future treatments are likely to include an implantable drug delivery system, gene therapy, and the <b>intravesical</b> <b>use</b> of the vallinoids capsaicin and resiniferatoxin (RTX). An understanding of the urothelium is essential for effective design of these therapies. Intravesical anticholinergic drug treatment is currently not widely used, but intravesical pumps are under development to provide less cumbersome treatment methods and will provide nonsurgical options for patients who cannot tolerate oral anticholinergic agents. Research on the use of capsaicin as an intravesicular drug has had limited success, but trials have confirmed the efficacy of intravesical capsaicin for detrusor hyperreflexia. RTX is as effective as capsaicin but without side effects, such as pain and inflammatory neuropeptide release.

40|$|PURPOSE: In {{search for}} a new drug for <b>intravesical</b> <b>use</b> in {{superficial}} urothelial cell carcinoma of the bladder, a pig model is used for pharmacokinetics and toxicity measurements after intravesically administered pemetrexed. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In the dose escalation phase, two groups of two pigs received 5 and 10 mg/kg pemetrexed intravesically; four groups of three pigs received 15, 20, 25, and 30 mg/kg, respectively. The well-being of the animals was monitored. Blood was studied for pharmacokinetic analysis and signs of myelosuppression. Posttreatment urine samples were collected to measure the concentration of pemetrexed after instillation. Twenty-four hours posttreatment, the animals were cystectomized and sacrificed. Histopathologic examination of the bladder wall was done. In the second study phase, five pigs were instilled weekly with the maximum tested dose for 6 weeks. The same methods were applied. RESULTS: All doses (5 - 30 mg/kg) in the first study phase were well tolerated, enabling the use of 30 mg/kg in the second study phase. In both study phases, the pigs' well-being was not influenced. Full blood counts showed no sign of myelosuppression. Systemic absorption was not observed. Urine pemetrexed concentrations remained almost unchanged. Histopathologic examination of the bladder wall did not reveal significant abnormalities. Bladder mucosa remained intact at any time, without hemorrhage.

40|$|Intravesical {{instillation}} of BCG or anticancer agents after {{transurethral resection}} is currently considered {{a standard of}} therapy. However, this approach is basically empirical; none of the anticancer agents used in this setting was specifically formulated for intravesical therapy. Moreover, concern is raised by the kinetic features of water soluble drugs, because of poor transport across the mucosal barrier, or of liphophylic compounds, for the increased risks of systemic toxicity. A need exists to improve the pre-clinical and clinical approaches used at present to test anticancer agents undergoing specific development for <b>intravesical</b> <b>use.</b> We used in vitro rabbit whole bladders as a new pre-clinical model to investigate the kinetics of locally administered anticancer agents. In this study, we investigated the rate of urothelial transport of a novel paclitaxel derivative, Oncofid-P (R). Male New Zealand albino rabbits were used. Bladders were rapidly explanted, filled with vehicle alone or vehicle containing graded concentrations of Oncofid-P. and kept for various times under standardized incubation conditions. At the end of experiments, drug concentrations were assessed by high-pressure-liquid-chromatography technique in the intravesical and external bath solutions, {{as well as in}} bladder wall homogenates. We found that less than 1 % of the drug additioned to the intravesical solution is recovered within the bladder wall in the form of paclitaxel; experiments carried out collecting different areas from the same bladders showed that Oncofid-P is uniformly distributed over the internal surface of bladder mucosa. Isolated rabbit bladders may be a useful pre-clinical model to investigate the rate of transport of chemotherapeutic agents administered by intravesical route. In this paradigm, Oncofid-P displays a kinetic profile that is predictive of local activity over the whole urothelial surface, and low or absent systemic absorption...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Apart from cystectomy, few {{treatment}} options {{exist for the}} management of bacillus Calmette-Guerin refractory non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). We report a multi-institutional experience with sequential <b>intravesical</b> combination chemotherapy <b>using</b> gemcitabine and mitomycin C (MMC) for NMIBC in the treatment of high-risk patients. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of patients who received 6 weekly treatments with sequential intravesical gemcitabine (1. g) and MMC (40. mg) chemotherapy for NMIBC. Gemcitabine was administered first and retained for 90 minutes and then drained. MMC was then administered directly after and retained for an additional 90 minutes. Forty-seven patients received treatment from 3 academic tertiary referral centers between 2000 and 2010. Results: Forty-seven patients (median age 70, range 32 - 85; 36 males, 11 females) who previously failed a median of 2 intravesical treatments were reviewed. Complete response, 1 -year, and 2 -year recurrence-free survival rates for all patients were 68 %, 48 %, and 38 %, respectively. Median recurrence-free survival for all patients was 9 months (range 1 - 80). Fourteen of 47 patients (30 %) remained free of recurrence with a median time to follow-up of 26 months (range 6 - 80. mo). Ten patients required cystectomy. Conclusion: Sequential <b>intravesical</b> combination chemotherapy <b>using</b> gemcitabine and MMC appears to be a useful treatment for patients with high-grade NMIBC as well as those with prior bacillus Calmette-Guerin failure.

40|$|BACKGROUND Anthracyclines {{have been}} {{established}} as first-line drugs for <b>intravesical</b> <b>use</b> {{in the treatment of}} patients with superficial bladder carcinoma, although they result only in a modest reduction in tumor recurrence rates. The essential fatty acid -linolenic acid (GLA) also is an effective cytotoxic agent against superficial bladder carcinoma when it is applied topically. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the efficacy of combined epirubicin and GLA with the purpose of developing a suitable model for modification of existing intravesical regimens. METHODS The human urothelial carcinoma cell lines MGH-U 1 and RT 112 were used in standard cytotoxicity assays and were exposed to meglumine GLA (MeGLA) and epirubicin in two-dimensional concentration matrices. A thiozolyl blue (methyl-thiazoldiphenyl tetrazolium) assay was used to determine residual cell biomass. Drug interaction was quantified by median-effect analysis software (CalcuSyn®), and the evaluation of drug uptake utilized fluorescence confocal microscopy (FCM) and flow cytometry. RESULTS MeGLA caused a significant enhancement of anthracycline uptake, viewed by FCM, from 92 fluorescence units to 222 fluorescence units (P < 0. 001). Flow cytometry confirmed the increased drug uptake and showed that the mean epirubicin content per cell increased from 23 to 57 units and from 8 to 24 units for MGH-U 1 and RT 112 cells, respectively (99 % confidence interval < 0. 3). This resulted in improved cytotoxicity, and it was shown that the drugs acted synergistically with all but the highest MeGLA concentrations. CONCLUSIONS The efficacy of epirubicin was enhanced significantly when it was used in combination with most concentrations of MeGLA (< 300 g/mL), and the two agents acted synergistically. There was a corresponding increase in epirubicin uptake by cells under these conditions. At high MeGLA concentrations, however, anthracycline solubility was compromised, and drug synergy was lost...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Superficial bladder cancer can {{be treated}} by {{transurethral}} resection and additional intravesical therapy. Although agents like Mitomycin C, Epirubicin and BCG are routinely used, {{there is a need}} for more potent and/or less toxic agents. Gemcitabine is a deoxycytidine analogue, used systemically for several tumours, such as non-localised bladder cancer, where it is effective and well tolerated. We investigated the use of three dose levels of gemcitabine when given intravesically in humans for safety and pharmacokinetic research. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with superficial bladder cancer, except pT 1 G 3 or CIS were included. Six weekly instillations of 1000, 1500 or 2000 mg gemcitabine were given in 50 ml saline for one hour. Dose modifications were defined in case of dose limiting toxicities. Blood samples were taken before, and 5, 30, 60 (= evacuation) and 120 minutes after instillations 1, 3 and 6. Samples were used for blood counts and pharmacokinetics. Side effects were noted. RESULTS: 3, 4 and 3 patients were treated with 1000, 1500, and 2000 mg gemcitabine respectively, of which 2, 3 and 1 patients had highly recurrent tumours before treatment. Seven patients experienced side effects: 2 with dysuria after the first instillation, 2 after instillations 3 - 6 and 4 - 6 and in 3 patients headache, fatigue and heavy legs were experienced once. All side effects were reversible, non-limiting and WHO 1. No macroscopic hematuria was seen. Haematology showed only one case of drop in white blood cell count (lowest dose level, after the first instillation). Gemcitabine plasma levels were immeasurable or low, with peak levels between 30 and 60 minutes, decreasing after more instillations. The metabolite difluorodeoxyuridine reached levels of at most 5 microM, indicating a very low passage of the drug to the systemic circulation. CONCLUSION: Intravesical gemcitabine in the dose used has minimal and reversible side effects. Plasma evaluation indicates that its <b>intravesical</b> <b>use</b> is safe...|$|E
40|$|Transurethral {{resection}} (TUR) of {{the superficial}} transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder {{is known to}} be insufficient in controlling the disease because of the unacceptable rates of recurrence, progression and ultimate cystectomy. Adjuvant intravesical chemo-and/or immunotherapy is administered in an effort to enhance the efficacy of surgery alone. The initial tumor stage and grade, the multifocality of this cancer and the history of previous recurrences remain the determinant factors in survival. It is important to decide exactly which patients are at risk, and, therefore, do need treatment. Knowledge of the natural history of the disease will facilitate this decision making, although the natural history of TCC is largely unpredictable owing to tumor heterogeneity. Several cytotoxic and immune modifying agents have been used intravesically in different treatment schedules. However, despite their effectiveness, no consensus exists about the optimal antineoplastic regimen. The selection of the latter is a subject of continuous investigation. Intravesical treatment with cytotoxic drugs has been demonstrated to achieve an acceptable reduction in short- and intermediate-term recurrence rates, but has no proven ability in preventing disease progression to muscle-invasive cancer or prolonging survival. On the other hand, bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) currently appears to be the most effective agent for <b>intravesical</b> <b>use,</b> especially in patients with high grade and stage neoplasms but the optimum strain, dosage and duration schedule have not been determined. Clinical trials have shown that BCG provides long-term protection from tumor recurrence, while there is evidence that it may favorably alter the progression rate of the disease with prolongation of survival. Toxicity of intravesical chemo- and immunotherapy still remains a major problem and attempts at reducing the dosage, and, thus, toxicity without affecting efficacy are underway. This review endeavors to present updated information on intravesical chemotherapy in treating superficial bladder cancer, the expanding role of intravesical immunotherapy, the recent work comparing various immunotherapeutic regimens with chemotherapeutic intravesical therapies, and the progress made towards achieving optimal treatment regimens...|$|E

40|$|Clean {{intermittent}} (self) catheterisation (CIC) {{in combination}} with oral anticholinergic drugs (oxybutynin hydrochloride [OH] is the present standard therapy for neurogenic bladder dysfunction (NBD) with detrusor hyperactivity. However, complete suppression of detrusor contractions and complete urinary continence is not always obtained despite maximal dosage, and {{the high incidence of}} severe systemic anticholinergic side-effects often impairs therapeutic compliance, resulting in dose reduction or even discontinuation of therapy. The intravesical administration of OH has been shown recently to be an effective alternative for treating persistent detrusor hyperactivity, and occurrence and severity of systemic side-effects appeared to be significantly decreased. However, available data are limited from a paediatric view. Furthermore, it is our belief that the use of crushed OH tablets with consequent problems of impracticability accounts for the variable long-term patient compliance reported to be the only disadvantage to <b>intravesical</b> OH. <b>Using</b> an optimized drug preparation we demonstrate the superiority of intravesical OH for treatment of NBD in 15 children (range 0. 6 - 13. 75 years, mean 6. 1) with incomplete detrusor activity suppression and/or intolerable systemic side-effects on oral OH therapy. Since the previous reported problems of impracticability and variable long-term patient compliance can be resolved by optimized drug preparation, we therefore conclude that the era of crushing OH tablets should be over in order to allow the intravesical OH therapy on a long-lasting and large-scale basis. status: publishe...|$|R

Generally, the microparticles exhibited a spherical shape with mean diameter of approximately 2 μm which was compatible with local <b>intravesical</b> administration <b>using</b> a catheter. The CB release studies from the microparticles allowed us to identify both immediate release systems (microparticles including the complexes) and prolonged release systems (microparticles including CB alone).

40|$|Multidrug {{resistance}} (MDR) {{describes the}} phenomenon whereby cancer cells {{exposed to a}} single cytotoxic drug develop cross resistance to numerous other structurally unrelated chemotherapeutics. The development of MDR is {{a major cause of}} cancer chemotherapy treatment failure in all types of cancer. Numerous mechanisms of MDR have been elucidated which include ATPbinding cassette (ABC) transporter proteins, cytoplasmic vaults, alterations in topoisomerase II and increased expression of glutathione-S-transferases, all of which result in reduced chemotherapeutic efficacy. Superficial bladder cancer is commonly treated with adjuvant <b>intravesical</b> chemotherapy <b>using</b> mitomycin C or epirubicin (an anthracycline), following surgical resection. However, despite this treatment, the recurrence rates of these tumours can approach 60 %. This high recurrence rate represents the development of MDR in many cases. Previous work using anthracycline fluorescence has shown that MDR cells have reduced levels of anthracycline uptake and also demonstrate a characteristic nuclear sparing of drug uptake. This nuclear sparing phenomenon in MDR cells transcends tissue type and suggests that the nuclear membrane may also play a role in MDR.

40|$|Non-muscle {{invasive}} bladder {{cancer is}} {{the most common type of}} bladder cancer in Western countries. The glycosaminoglycan (GAG) layer at the bladder surface non-specifically blocks the adherence of bacteria, ions and molecules to the bladder epithelium and bladder cancer cells express CD 44 that binds GAG. Currently, there are few options other than cystectomy for the management of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer with <b>intravesical</b> chemotherapy <b>using</b> several drugs such as gemcitabine (GEM) and mitomycin-C (MMC) with poor prophylactic activity. In this study, we investigated the effects of the GAG chondroitin sulphate (CS) on the growth inhibition of human bladder cancer cell lines HT- 1376 and effects of the combination between GEM or MMC with CS. We have found that CS, MMC and GEM induced 50 % growth inhibition at 72 h. Therefore, we have evaluated the growth inhibition induced by different concentration of CS in combination with MMC or GEM, respectively, at 72 h. We have observed, at Calcusyn analysis, a synergism when HT- 1376 cells were treated with CS in combination with MMC or GEM, respectively, if used at an equimolar ratio. We have also found that CS/GEM combination induced a strong potentiation of apoptosis with the consequent activation of caspases 9 and 3. On the other hand, HT- 1376 cells were necrotic if exposed to the CS/MMC combination and no signs of caspase activation was observed. In conclusion, in the human bladder cancer cell line HT- 1376 pharmacological combination of CS with GEM or MMC resulted in a strong synergism on cell growth inhibition...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} an original smooth muscle model {{based on the}} Huxley microscopic approach. This model is {{the main part of}} a comprehensive lower urinary track model. The latter is used for simulation studies and is assessed through experiments on rabbits, for which a subset of parameters is estimated, <b>using</b> <b>intravesical</b> pressure measurements in isometric conditions. Bladder contraction is induced by electrical stimulation that determines the onset and thus synchronizes simulation and experimental data. Model sensitivity versus parameter accuracy is discussed and allows the definition of a subset of four parameters that must be accurately identified in order to obtain good fitting between experimental and acquired data. Preliminary experimental data are presented as well as model identification results. They show that the model is able to follow the pressure changes induced by an artificial stimulus in isometric contractions. Moreover, the model gives an insight into the internal changes in calcium concentration and the ratio of the different chemical species present in the muscle cells, in particular the bounded and unbounded actin and myosin and the normalized concentration of intracellular calcium...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{the present}} study is to compare a {{hydrophilic}} catheter to the standard polyvinyl chloride catheter with regard to bacteriological safety and overall comfort in patients undergoing intravesical immuno- or chemotherapy for bladder cancer. Materials and Methods: One hundred patients (80 males, 20 females; median age 65. 8 years, range 48 - 79 years) eligible for intravesical prophylaxis of superficial bladder cancer recurrences were randomized to receive <b>intravesical</b> therapy <b>using</b> a standard catheter (group A, n = 50) or a hydrophilic catheter (group B, n = 50). Urinalysis and urine culture were performed 2 days after catheterization. Comfort during catheterization was assessed by a 5 -point visual analogue scale {{at the end of the}} first four instillations. Results: Urinary tract infection (UTI) was detected in 7. 4 % of catheterizations in group A, whereas it occurred in 3. 5 % of catheterizations in group B (p < 0. 01). Escherichia coli was the most frequent pathogen regardless of the device used. At the end of each of the first four instillations, the mean score for discomfort was significantly higher in group A than in group B (p < 0. 001), although catheterization was progressively better tolerated regardless of the device used (both p < 0. 005). None of the patients were found to be suffering from orchitis, epididymitis or gross haematuria. Conclusion: Hydrophilic catheters may be used safely and are well tolerated by patients undergoing intravesical immuno- or chemotherapy. The hydrophilic catheter was associated with a significantly lower occurrence of UTI and higher acceptability compared to the standard device. These data should be considered with regard to patient compliance with intravesical therapy. Copyright (C) 2004 S. Karger AG, Basel...|$|R
40|$|CONTEXT: Controversy exists {{regarding}} the therapeutic benefit and cost effectiveness of photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) with 5 -aminolevulinic acid (5 -ALA) or hexyl aminolevulinate (HAL) {{in addition to}} white-light cystoscopy (WLC) {{in the management of}} non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate evidence {{regarding the}} therapeutic benefits and economic considerations of PDD in NMIBC detection and treatment. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We performed a critical review of PubMed/Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library in October 2012 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement. Identified reports were reviewed according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) and Standards for the Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (STARD) criteria. Forty-four publications were selected for inclusion in this analysis. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Included reports used 5 -ALA (in 26 studies), HAL (15 studies), or both (three studies) as photosensitising agents. PDD increased the detection of both papillary tumours (by 7 - 29 %) and flat carcinoma in situ (CIS; by 25 - 30 %) and reduced the rate of residual tumours after transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT; by an average of 20 %) compared to WLC alone. Superior recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates and prolonged RFS intervals were reported for PDD, compared to WLC in most studies. PDD did not appear to reduce disease progression. Our findings are limited by tumour heterogeneity and a lack of NMIBC risk stratification in many reports or adjustment for <b>intravesical</b> therapy <b>use</b> in most studies. Although cost effectiveness has been demonstrated for 5 -ALA, it has not been studied for HAL. CONCLUSIONS: Moderately strong evidence exists that PDD improves tumour detection and reduces residual disease after TURBT compared with WLC. This has been shown to improve RFS but not progression to more advanced disease. Further work to evaluate cost effectiveness of PDD is required...|$|R
40|$|Cystoscopic {{removal of}} an {{intravesical}} gossypiboma mimicking a bladder mass: a case report Romeo Kansakar 1 * and Bhairab Kumar Hamal 2 Background: Intravesical retained surgical sponges are very rare {{and only a}} few cases have been removed by minimally invasive techniques. Case presentation: We report a case of an intravesical gossypiboma in a 71 -year-old man from western Nepal, who presented with urinary retention and persistent lower urinary tract symptoms one year after open cystolithotomy. He was diagnosed with an <b>intravesical</b> mass <b>using</b> ultrasonography. The retained surgical sponge was found during cystoscopy and removed through endoscopy. Conclusion: Intravesical gossypibomas are rare and can mimic a bladder mass. This {{is one of the few}} reported cases of cystoscopic removal. Background Gossypiboma denotes a foreign body made of cotton that is retained inside the patient during surgery [1]. Although it is an uncommon condition, it is the dread of every surgeon. It has been reported to occur following surgical procedures such as abdominal, thoracic, cardiovascular, orthopedic, urological and even neurosurgical operations [2 - 4]. It is estimated to occur in one in 100 to 3000 cases for all surgical interventions and one in 1000 to 1500 for intra-abdominal operations [5]. Preoperative diagnosis may be difficult due to nonspecific symptoms and inconclusive imaging findings [6]. There have been few reports of intravesical gossypibomas and even fewer reports of cystoscopic removal [7 - 9]. We report a case of a retained intravesical sponge following open cystolithotomy, with transurethral removal under cystoscopic guidance. Case presentation A 71 -year-old man from western Nepal presented to us with a history of urinary retention for 20 days for which a urinary catheter was placed. He had been experiencin...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Although {{conventional}} cystoscopy {{is considered}} to be the gold standard for diagnosis and follow-up of bladder tumors, it remains an invasive and costly procedure. With the advent of the multidetector CT (MDCT) scanners supported by specialized software virtual cystoscopy (VC) is possible. We assess the role of VC in diagnosing and evaluating bladder lesions. Materials and Methods. Between September 2010 and October 2011, 25 consecutive patients with cystoscopically confirmed bladder tumor underwent VC. The radiologists involved in this prospective study were blinded to the exact findings. After draining any residual urine with a catheter, the bladder was retrogradely insufflated with 200 – 600 [*]cc of air. No intravenous or <b>intravesical</b> contrast was <b>used.</b> MDCT scan was performed in supine and prone positions and three-dimensional reconstruction of the urinary bladder was performed. Results. The examination was well tolerated by all patients with no complications. In total, 43 lesions were detected both with conventional cystoscopy and VC. Tumor size measured by CT ranged from 3 to 80 mm in diameter. The pathological report revealed noninvasive transitional cell carcinomas in all cases. Conclusion. VC has promising results in detecting exophytic bladder lesions. In the future it could be part of the diagnostic algorithm for bladder tumors...|$|R
40|$|The high {{incidence}} of tumor recurrence following transurethral resection (TUR) represents a major problem encountered {{in the management of}} bladder cancer. This study examined the efficacy of intravesical chemotherapy in superficial bladder cancer. We retrospectively analyzed 90 Japanese cases with low-grade superficial transitional cell carcinoma (stage T 1, grades 1 and 2) who were rendered tumor-free by TURBT (TUR of bladder tumor) and who thereafter were treated with or without intravesical chemotherapy. Among them, instillation was terminated in 2 patients due to adverse effects (severe but reversible chemical cystitis). Remaining 88 patients were divided into 2 groups according to therapy: the TURBT-only group (n= 46), defined as patients treated with TURBT alone, and the Instillation group (n= 42), defined as patients treated with weekly <b>intravesical</b> instillation therapies <b>using</b> epirubicin plus Ara-C. Recurrence-free rate was significantly higher in the Instillation group than in the TURBT-only group (p= 0. 02, HR = 0. 457). The 5 -year recurrence-free rate was 58. 5 % for the Instillation group and 38. 6 % for the TURBT-only group. Our instillation schedule represents the most intensive regimen among previously reported therapies and resulted in a 54. 3 % decrease in incidence of tumor recurrence. We believe that {{the results of this study}} could provide useful information on management of bladder cancer...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Correction of {{gastroschisis}} can {{be accomplished}} by primary or staged closure. There is, however, no consensus regarding the best approach or criteria to favor one method over the other has been established. OBJECTIVE: To compare the outcome of primary and staged closure in newborns with gastroschisis <b>using</b> <b>intravesical</b> pressure (IVP) as the decision criterion. PATIENTS & METHODS: We prospectively analyzed 45 newborns with gastroschisis. An IVP with a threshold of 20 cm H 2 O was used to indicate primary or staged closure, and the outcomes between the two methods were compared. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Newborns in whom primary closure was feasible were born at a lower gestational age. There {{was no significant difference in}} the frequency of complications, time to begin oral feeding, length of parenteral nutrition or length of hospital stay. Compared with previous reports, our data showed higher rates of prenatal diagnosis and cesarean delivery, a lower average birth weight, a higher rate of small gestational age babies and a more frequent association with intestinal atresia. Conversely, our data showed a lower rate of postoperative necrotizing enterocolitis and a lower average length of hospital stay. CONCLUSION: No significant difference was observed in the outcome of newborns who underwent primary closure or staged closure of gastroschisis when using an IVP below 20 cm H 2 O as the criterion for primary closure...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} if bladder mast cell degranulation {{is involved in}} the genesis of neurogenic cystitis induced by pseudorabies virus (PRV) invasion of the central nervous system (CNS). Materials and Methods: Rats received a total of 4 � 10 6 plaque forming units (pfu) of PRV-Bartha in the abductor caudalis dorsalis (ACD) muscle. Granulated bladder mast cells per mm 2 of bladder tissue and urine histamine content were monitored as the cystitis developed over the next few days. In a subgroup of rats, <b>intravesical</b> resiniferatoxin was <b>used</b> to remove capsaicin-sensitive sensory bladder afferents, while another subgroup was pretreated with a mast cell degranulator. Results: PRV injection into the ACD muscle leads to neurogenic cystitis. Histamine levels were elevated in the urine of virus injected rats before any behavioral or microscopical signs of cystitis were present. When the cystitis became clinically manifest, urine histamine returned to control levels, and the number of granulated mast cells dropped significantly. Rats in which capsaicinsensitive afferents had been removed did not show any signs of cystitis, or increase in urine histamine, or change in the number of granulated mast cells. Pretreatment of animals with a mast cell degranulator completely prevented the appearance of cystitis without altering the CNS disease. Conclusion: These results provide further evidence that mast cells are involved in neurogenic cystitis induced by changes in CNS activity...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe use of {{ketamine}} as {{a recreational}} drug, particularly among teenagers, {{has increased dramatically}} {{in the past few}} years in Taiwan. Its effects on the central nervous and cardiovascular systems are well characterized, but an increasing amount of evidence demonstrates its association with urinary tract pathologies. Chronic ketamine use has been associated with severe ulcerative cystitis. Symptoms and signs of long-term ketamine abuse include: hematuria; increased voiding frequency; urgency; bladder pain; dysuria; nocturia; decreased bladder capacity; urothelial ulceration, and eosinophil infiltration. Vesicoureteral reflux and renal function impairment may also occur in heavy ketamine users. How ketamine use produces these symptoms is not clear. Dysregulation of purinergic neurotransmission has recently been found to play a role in the detrusor overactivity in ketamine-induced bladder dysfunction. The goal of treatment is to prevent deterioration of the renal function and indeed offer the possibility of symptom resolution. Currently, ketamine cessation is the only effective treatment modality, but the effect is likely to be dependent on the severity and duration of the abuse. Anticholinergic agents fail to relieve the symptoms induced by chronic ketamine <b>use.</b> <b>Intravesical</b> hyaluronan solution instillation may help improve the symptoms, but more clinical studies are required to provide evidence of the effectiveness. A multidisciplinary treatment team of doctors, psychiatrists, nurses, therapists, and clinicians will facilitate best practice management of patients with ketamine-associated cystitis...|$|R
