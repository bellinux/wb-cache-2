40|$|Vigorous {{measures}} {{to combat the}} ‘so-called Spanish influenza’ were outlined at the semi-annual meeting of {{the state board of}} health held at the Davenport [Spokane hotel] • The Board meeting was attended by Dr. J. R. Brown, Tacoma, president; Dr. T. E. Hedges, Everett; Mrs. R. C. McCready, Sunnyside; Dr. H. H. McCarthy, Spokane, and Dr. T. D. Tuttle, Seattle; all state health commissioners• A request for assistance from the public in preventing the spread of the epidemic was issued yesterday afternoon by Dr. Tuttle and Dr. McCarthy, who stated that the disease had already made its appearance in Spokane {{and other parts of the}} northwest• Successive waves of the malady may be expected in the next six weeks to two months and if the situation becomes serious it may be necessary to prevent all public gatherings, close theaters, churches and Sunday schools and perhaps even the public schools throughout the state• State Commissioner T. D. Tuttle said that, “We can not afford, in existing conditions, to risk incapacitation of the man and woman power of the country, nor even that of the children. These are war times, and the most stringent measures must be adopted to conserve and protect the public health. The disease is here and the situation is almost certain to become worse. ”• Tuttle continued, “We have been informed unofficially that of about 1500 men recently sent to naval stations on Puget Sound fully 10 per cent were afflicted with the disease and we have every reason to believe that it has reached Spokane. It is a disorder that spreads rapidly in a community, being transmitted through the secretions of the nose and throat, and we know that it is spread rapidly by large gatherings of people. To establish quarantine for influenza does not seem practicable and the state board of health urges every one afflicted with the disease to practice voluntary quarantine and if they have anything like what we are in the habit of calling ‘grippe’ they should keep away from others. The public must be brought to realize that we are facing a serious situation and that it is a patriotic <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>render</b> every <b>aid</b> possible. ”Newspaper article...|$|R
