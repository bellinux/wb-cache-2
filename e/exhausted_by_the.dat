India led the world in diamond production from the time of their discovery in approximately the 9th century BC to the mid-18th century AD, but the commercial potential of these sources had been <b>exhausted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> late 18th century and at that time India was eclipsed by Brazil where the first non-Indian diamonds were found in 1725.|$|E
5|$|Although the Third Crusade, in the end, {{failed to}} retake Jerusalem, a three-year truce was {{eventually}} negotiated with Saladin. The truce, {{known as the}} Treaty of Jaffa, ensured that Christian pilgrims from the west would once again be allowed to visit Jerusalem. Saladin also recognised the Crusaders' control of the Levantine coast {{as far south as}} Jaffa. Both sides had become <b>exhausted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> struggle, Richard needed to return to Europe in order to protect his patrimony from the aggression of Philip of France, and Palestine was in a ruinous state.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though the}} Chinese and North Koreans were <b>exhausted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> war and were {{prepared}} to end it by late 1952, Stalin insisted that they continue fighting, and the Armistice was approved only in July 1953, after Stalin's death. North Korean leader Kim Il Sung created a highly centralized, totalitarian dictatorship – which continues to date – according himself unlimited power and generating a formidable cult of personality. In the South, the American-backed strongman Syngman Rhee ran a significantly less brutal but deeply corrupt and authoritarian regime. After Rhee was overthrown in 1960, South Korea fell within a year under a period of military rule that lasted until the re-establishment of a multi-party system in the late 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{diamonds}} {{were found}} only in alluvial deposits in Guntur and Krishna district of the Krishna River delta in Southern India.

5|$|In 1955, Fisher, <b>exhausted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{constant}} pressure, {{returned to}} Moscow {{for six months}} of rest and recuperation, leaving Häyhänen in charge. While in Moscow, Fisher informed his superiors of his dissatisfaction with Häyhänen. Upon his return to New York in 1956, he found that his carefully constructed network had been left to disintegrate in his absence. Fisher checked his drop points only to find messages several months old, while Häyhänen's radio transmissions had routinely been sent from the same location using incorrect radio frequencies. The money Häyhänen received from the KGB to support the network was instead spent on alcohol and prostitutes.|$|E

A day later they were joined by many nobles and their families and many more people; they then surrendered at the new Spanish capital at Ciudad Vieja. The former inhabitants of Iximche were dispersed; some were moved to Tecpán, the rest to Sololá and other towns around Lake Atitlán.|$|E

5|$|War with Sweden, {{now under}} Gustavus Adolphus, resumed in 1621 with his attack on Riga, {{followed}} by the Swedish occupation of much of Livonia, control of Baltic Sea coast up to Puck and the blockade of Danzig. The Commonwealth, <b>exhausted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> warfare {{that had taken place}} elsewhere, in 1626–1627 mustered a response, utilizing the military talents of Hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski and help from Austria. Under pressure from several European powers, the campaign was stopped and ended in the Truce of Altmark, leaving in Swedish hands much of what Gustavus Adolphus had conquered.|$|E
25|$|Chemical rockets are {{the most}} common type of high power rocket, {{typically}} creating a high speed <b>exhaust</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> combustion of fuel with an oxidizer. The stored propellant can be a simple pressurized gas or a single liquid fuel that disassociates in the presence of a catalyst (monopropellants), two liquids that spontaneously react on contact (hypergolic propellants), two liquids that must be ignited to react, a solid combination of fuel with oxidizer (solid fuel), or solid fuel with liquid oxidizer (hybrid propellant system). Chemical rockets store a large amount of energy in an easily released form, and can be very dangerous. However, careful design, testing, construction and use minimizes risks.|$|R

5|$|Caxias {{was growing}} old, and was ill and <b>exhausted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{time he reached}} Asunción. As {{he did not feel}} up to the task of {{pursuing}} López into the Paraguayan hinterland, he asked to be either relieved of his post or given a short leave. Although his request was denied, he appointed a senior member of his staff as acting commander, and left for Brazil on 19 January 1869. The Emperor was angered that the marquis had left his post without permission, and especially that Caxias had declared the war to have been already won—even though López was still at large and regrouping his few remaining military assets. Caxias' ill-conceived decision seriously endangered the hard-won achievements of the past months, even as the objective of eliminating López as a threat remained tantalizingly within reach.|$|E
5|$|More acute {{threat to}} the Polish–Lithuanian state came from Sweden. The {{balance of power in}} the north had shifted in Sweden's favor, as the Baltic {{neighbor}} was led by King Gustavus Adolphus, a highly able and aggressive military leader, who greatly improved the effectiveness of the Swedish armed forces, while also taking advantage of Protestant zealotry. The Commonwealth, <b>exhausted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> wars with Russia and the Ottoman Empire and lacking allies, was poorly prepared to face this new challenge. Continuous diplomatic maneuvering by Sigismund III made the whole situation look to szlachta like another stage in the King's Swedish dynastic affairs; in reality the Swedish power resolved to take hold of the entire Polish-controlled Baltic coast, and thereby profit from the Commonwealth's maritime trade intermediary control, endangering its basis for independent existence.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made of}} an exhaust-gas turbine having four separate nozzle boxes each covering a 90 degree arc of the nozzle diaphragm and each connected {{to a pair of}} adjacent cylinders of a nine-cylinder radial engine. This type of turbine has been called a "blowdown" turbine because it recovers the kinetic energy developed in the exhaust stacks during the blowdown period, that is {{the first part of the}} exhaust process when the piston of the reciprocating engine is nearly stationary. The purpose of the {{investigation was}} to determine whether the blow turbine could develop appreciable power without imposing any large loss in engine power arising from restriction of <b>the</b> engine <b>exhaust</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> turbine...|$|R

5|$|The devastating {{impact of}} this last war, added to the {{cumulative}} effects of a century of almost continuous conflict, left both empires crippled. When Kavadh II died only months after coming to the throne, Persia was plunged into several years of dynastic turmoil and civil war. The Sasanians were further weakened by economic decline, heavy taxation from Khosrau II's campaigns, religious unrest, and the increasing power of the provincial landholders. The Byzantine Empire was also severely affected, with its financial reserves <b>exhausted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> war and the Balkans now largely {{in the hands of}} the Slavs. Additionally, Anatolia was devastated by repeated Persian invasions; the Empire's hold on its recently regained territories in the Caucasus, Syria, Mesopotamia, Palestine and Egypt was loosened by many years of Persian occupation.|$|E
5|$|The fall of Čegar {{allowed the}} Ottomans to {{establish}} a land corridor extending along the Morava River valley from Niš to the Danube. The advance was brought to a halt after the Russians crossed the Danube in September 1809 and attacked the Ottomans in northern Bulgaria, offering the rebels temporary respite. The rebels soon recaptured all the land that they had lost, but were <b>exhausted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fighting. Henceforth, they were continuously on the defensive. The rebel leaders quarrelled among themselves, blaming {{each other for the}} recent defeats. Karađorđe blamed the Russians for not intervening earlier on the rebels' behalf. His behaviour became more volatile as battlefield setbacks mounted. In late 1809, he shot and wounded one of his commanders, Petar Jokić, for making a poor military decision in the vicinity of Ćuprija.|$|E
5|$|The {{morning of}} the {{evacuation}} promised a perfect day. The sun rose out of a calm and sparkling sea and warmed the impassive cliffs of Oiseval. The sky was hopelessly blue {{and the sight of}} Hirta, green and pleasant as the island of so many careless dreams, made parting all the more difficult. Observing tradition the islanders left an open Bible and a small pile of oats in each house, locked all the doors and at 7am boarded the Harebell. Although <b>exhausted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> strain and hard work of the last few days, they were reported to have stayed cheerful throughout the operation. But as the long antler of Dun fell back onto the horizon and the familiar outline of the island grew faint, the severing of an ancient tie became a reality and the St Kildans gave way to tears.|$|E

40|$|Six-stroke {{diesel engine}} {{proposed}} here has six processes in one cycle, i. e. intake, 1 st compression, 1 st combustion, 2 nd compression, 2 nd combustion and <b>exhaust.</b> <b>By</b> <b>the</b> direct EGR in the 2 nd combustion process, NO emission {{could be expected}} to decrease. However, much Soot was <b>exhausted</b> <b>by</b> a weak mixing in the 2 nd combustion process. A high pressure injection with a common rail was introduced into the engine to improve the mixing in the second combustion process. As a result, more NO was exhausted while Soot was decreased due to better mixing. In this study, to decrease NO and Soot simultaneously, two stage fuel injection was applied to the 1 st combustion. When the main injection timing for the 1 st combustion process was extremely delayed, NO and Soot were decreased. It was considered that NO reduction was due to the 1 st combustion of low temperature and EGR effect in the 2 nd combustion. Also, Soot reduction was due to a relatively long ignition delay for the 2 nd combustio...|$|R
40|$|The {{reduction}} of {{oxides of nitrogen}} (NO(x)) emissions from aircraft gas turbine engines is {{a vital part of}} the NASA High Speed Research Program. Emissions reductions are critical to the feasibility of future High Speed Civil Transports which operate at supersonic speeds in the stratosphere.
