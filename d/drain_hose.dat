50|$|In 2014, it was {{reported}} that use of common garden hoses in combination with spray nozzles may generate aerosols containing droplets smaller than 10 μm, which can be inhaled by nearby people. Water stagnating in a hose between uses, especially when warmed by the sun, can host the growth and interaction of Legionella and free-living amoebae (FLA) as biofilms on the inner surface of the hose. Clinical cases of Legionnaires' disease or Pontiac fever {{have been found to be}} associated with inhalation of garden hose aerosols containing Legionella bacteria. The report provided measured microbial densities resulting from controlled hose conditions in order to quantify the human health risks. The densities of Legionella spp. identified in two types of hoses were found to be similar to those reported during legionellosis outbreaks from other causes. It was proposed that the risk could be mitigated by <b>draining</b> <b>hoses</b> after use.|$|R
50|$|Many {{portable}} dehumidifiers {{can also}} be adapted to connect the condensate drip output directly to a <b>drain</b> via a <b>hose.</b> Some dehumidifier models can tie into plumbing drains or use a built-in water pump to empty themselves as they collect moisture. Alternatively, a separate condensate pump {{may be used to}} move collected water to a disposal location when gravity drainage is not possible.|$|R
50|$|Most washer dryer combos are ventless and are {{designed}} with drying systems that work differently from the ordinary stand-alone (vented) dryer. Instead of venting moist hot air to the outside, like a conventional dryer would, the combo unit makes use of condensation similarly to condenser dryers. Hot dry(er) air enters the drum from either the front or the rear, and evaporates some of the moisture from the tumbling clothing. This warm, damp air is then drawn through a condensing chamber, and the extracted water is flushed out the <b>drain</b> <b>hose</b> to the sink or through the plumbing lines. These units are easy to install under cabinets, in closets or anywhere with electricity.|$|E
40|$|Het Nieuwe Telen (The New Growing) {{results in}} {{applying}} more screen layers that stay completely closed. In practise this causes problems with drip. In this research {{the impact of}} 2 screen layers and using screen gaps {{on the amount of}} drip from the screens or the greenhouse cover is investigated. Solutions to reduce the problems related to drip were proposed and tested in the greenhouse. During spring and winter 2016, measurements were performed at a tomato greenhouse with artificial lighting, blackout screen, energy screen and a Ventilationjet system. The daily amount of the condensation water that drips from the greenhouse ridge, gutter and the Ventilationjet was determined. In contrast to the general expectations, the drip does not come from the screens but from the greenhouse cover and from the Ventilationjets. Condensation occurred at the screens but this did not result in drip from these screens. Only 0. 2 % of the condensation against the greenhouse cover drips into the greenhouse. If this drip would be re evaporated, the energy costs for heating would increase with 0. 0008 m 3 gas /m 2 /week. Investments to reduce drip can thus only be paid back by a better crop quality and not by energy savings. The use of the inlet ventilator of the Ventilationjet system or the use of a screen gap increases the amount of condensation on a cold greenhouse cover. Drip from the greenhouse gutter was solved by applying a condensation gutter and the drip from the duct of the Ventilationjet was solved by applying a collecting tray with <b>drain</b> <b>hose...</b>|$|E

Aiming to simulate didactic problems in classrooms related to this important area of engineering, a sandy and massive prototype in an acrylic box of 0, 3 X 0, 3 X 1, 00 m was constructed, in the Laboratory of Soil Mechanics and Geology of UNINOVE. In its interior, five vertical <b>drains</b> using corrugated <b>hoses</b> of 1 of diameter covered with a geotêxtil blanket were made. These hoses were connected by a 1 of diameter collecting pipe, surrounded in a geotêxtil layer and contained inside of a draining carpet of gravel soil.

40|$|For {{the purpose}} of this procedure, the term "ARB " refers to the State of California Air Resources Board, and the term "ARB Executive Officer " refers to the Executive Officer of the ARB or his or her {{authorized}} representative or designate. This procedure is used to quantify the removal of liquid gasoline from the vapor passage of coaxial hoses equipped with a liquid removal device. It is applicable in all cases where a liquid removal system is required in conjunction with a Phase II balance system. This test procedure is explicitly not applicable to vapor assist type systems. 2 PRINCIPLE AND SUMMARY OF TEST PROCEDURE All gasoline is drained from the dispenser hose’s vapor passage and a measured amount of liquid gasoline, usually 150 ml, is then introduced into the vapor passage. After ten gallons of gasoline are dispensed the liquid remaining in the hose is measured and the amount removed determined by subtraction with consideration of liquid which may adhere to the hose wall or be lost by evaporation. 3 BIASES AND INTERFERENCES Pouring 150 ml of fuel into the vapor passage may cause some nozzles to shut off prematurely. This can be usually overcome by using a smaller volume. Allowing insufficient time for liquid to <b>drain</b> from the <b>hose</b> can cause errors in April 2000 TP- 201. 6 Page 1 measurement of the volume drained. 4 SENSITIVITY, RANGE, AND PRECISION Range of measurement of liquid removal is approximately from 0 to 15 ml removed per gallon dispensed; upper range depends on volume of gasoline lost due to evaporation and surface adhesion to the hose wall and on the ability of the nozzle to function without premature shutoff with 150 ml of gasoline in the vapor passage. 5 EQUIPMEN...|$|R
