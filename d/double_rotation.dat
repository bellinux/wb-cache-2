40|$|Abstract. We predict polarimetric line {{profiles}} for scattering off rotating disks using a Monte Carlo technique. We have dis-covered {{that there}} is a marked difference between scattering of line emission by a disk that reaches the stellar surface, and a disk with an inner hole. For the case with an inner hole, we find single position-angle rotations, similar to those predicted by analytic models. For the case of an undisrupted disk, we find <b>double</b> <b>rotations</b> in the position angle – an effect not reported before. We show that this new effect is due to the finite-sized star interacting with the disk’s rotational velocity field. Since a gradual increase of the hole size transforms the <b>double</b> <b>rotations</b> smoothly back into single ones – as the line emission object approaches that of a point source – our models demonstrate the diagnostic potential of line polarimetry in determining not only the disk inclination, but also the size of the disk inner hole. Our models are generic, and relevant to any line emitting object that is embedded in a rotating disk. Examples are: Herbig Ae stars, T Tauri stars, other young stars, early-type stars with disks, post-AGB stars, cataclysmic variables and other binary systems, as well as extra-galactic objects, such as the disks around super-massive black holes...|$|R

40|$|Questionnaire {{surveys and}} motor {{performance}} tests {{were performed on}} 37 female students in the Department of Dance and Physical Education, Ochanomizu University, to investigate lateral differences in dance movements. Some typical movements employed for the classical ballet-balance (Developpe), jump (Grant jete) and turns (Pirouettes en dehors, Fouette en tournant, Tour piques) -were examined. The questionnaire survey showed that students tend to prefer the left lower limb as the supporting leg for each movement. Especially pirouettes en dehors were studied in detail by means of 3 -dimensional graphical analysis (Ariel Performance Analysis System) of 11 students who had been trained for classical ballet. They were divided into advanced or beginning groups according to their skillfulness. The ratio of time required for each phase of pirouettes en dehors to the whole motion was analyzed with-the aid of the 3 -dimensional graphics. Single rotations were broken down into 6 phases and <b>double</b> serial <b>rotations</b> into 8 phases. The advanced group showed large lateral differences: more for <b>double</b> serial <b>rotations</b> than for single r otations. The beginning group showed the opposite tendency. Large differences were found {{at the end of}} the rotations in both groups. Precessional rotation-which unavoidably accompanies pirouettes en dehors-was analyzed for each group with stick figures. Large lateral differences indicated in the <b>double</b> serial <b>rotations</b> for the advanced group could neither be recognized in the <b>double</b> serial <b>rotations</b> nor in the single rotations in the case of the beginning group. Large differences in the displacement of the centre of body mass are shown in the beginning group based on analysis of every movement. Larger lateral differences were shown in the <b>double</b> serial <b>rotations</b> than in single rotations in the advanced group. In the case of the advanced and begining group, the changes in acceleration of the centre of body mass indicate large lateral differences at the beginning and the end of rotations. It seems to be difficult for both groups to control the long axis during rotations, especially in the two phases when the swinging leg leaves the floor and touches it again. From the conscious and functional point of view, lateral differences in dance movements indicated between the advanced and beginning groups are reasonably explained from thei r level of skill...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We study various bubble {{solutions}} in string/M theories obtained by <b>double</b> Wick <b>rotations</b> of (non-) extremal brane configurations.

For the application of these solutions to cosmology, we consider multi-bubble solutions and find landscapes of varying cosmological constant. <b>Double</b> Wick <b>rotation</b> in string/M theories, used in this paper, introduces imaginary higherform fields.
