50|$|The {{modernisation}} of {{the fleet}} was continued with the delivery from 1957 to 1963 of large carriages from Waggonfabrik Rastatt, including the OEG’s first articulated train sets in 1960. At {{the same time the}} improvement of the safety of level crossings began with the installation of flashing light systems; this equipment was later augmented with <b>half-barriers.</b>|$|R

2500|$|In Hungary, level {{crossings}} mostly {{do not have}} audible tones, and some also do not have lights. Full barriers usually don't have lights, but have an audible warning. Crossings equipped with lights are common. The newest, and best solution is [...] a crossing equipped with <b>half-barriers</b> and LED-lights. A unique type of {{level crossings}} in Hungary have a sign saying [...] "10 percen túl is zárva tartható" [...] (can be kept closed for more than 10 minutes).|$|R
50|$|The closed station {{buildings}} survive (next to {{an automatic}} <b>half-barrier</b> level crossing) {{and are now}} occupied. They are passed by trains on the single track Aberdeen to Inverness Line. Remains of a platform can also be seen.|$|E
50|$|By January 1968 {{there were}} 207 {{automatic}} crossings in Britain {{including the one}} at Hixon, which had been converted to automatic <b>half-barrier</b> operation in July 1967. Incidentally, Hixon was only eight miles from the pioneering installation at Spath.|$|E
50|$|Balderton {{railway station}} {{was a minor}} railway station serving the village of Balderton in Cheshire, England. It was located on the Great Western Railway (GWR) main line from London Paddington to Birkenhead Woodside. The 53 yd Balderton Tunnel is {{just south of the}} station site, and there is an {{automatic}} <b>half-barrier</b> (AHB) level crossing adjacent to the site today.|$|E
50|$|In October 1956, {{senior members}} of the Railway Inspectorate {{embarked}} on a fact-finding trip to the Netherlands, Belgium and France, to investigate the practice of automating level crossings. Their subsequent report recommended the introduction of automatically operated crossings with <b>half-barriers,</b> known as AHBs. This was projected to give considerable cost savings through the withdrawal of crossing keepers and would also speed up the flow of road traffic; the crossing being closed for less than a minute as opposed to 3 or 4 minutes at manned crossings.|$|R
40|$|Safety is a {{key issue}} in railway operation. In this context, level {{crossings}} (LCs) {{are one of the}} most critical points in railway networks. In some countries, accidents at LC account for up to 50 % of railway accidents. In this paper, we conduct a risk assessment comparative study involving two main types of Automatic Protection Systems (APSs), the first using a pair of <b>half-barriers</b> and the second with four <b>half-barriers.</b> So far, the choice of such LC protection systems has been exclusively done on the basis of qualitative expertise. The study we carry out here is based on some parameterizable behavioral models we have developed, which describe the global dynamics within the LC area. In contrast to existing studies on LC safety, our models take into account not only railway and road traffic but also the risk due to human factors while focusing on two major risky situations. The simulation results clearly show the potential risk with each of the investigated APSs, according to various features of the dynamics within the LC area. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work dealing with a quantitative comparison between different types of LCs. The developed models can be easily accommodated in order to describe existing infrastructures...|$|R
50|$|There is a {{very busy}} level {{crossing}} further along the same line on Easthampstead Road at Star Lane. BR installed automatic <b>half-barriers</b> (AHB) on it in about 1964. In 1997 Railtrack upgraded it to full barriers and equipped it with CCTV. BR equipped Waterloo Crossing with AHBs in 1965, and they remain in use today. BR also converted Amen Corner level crossing to AHBs, but in 1982 the A329 road was re-routed and two bridges were built to replace the Level crossing. The diverted road uses an overbridge nearer Wokingham station, and a pedestrian footbridge occupies {{the site of the}} former crossing.|$|R
5000|$|The {{station is}} unstaffed and has very basic {{facilities}} (the station house is privately owned {{and all the}} other buildings have been demolished, leaving only waiting shelters on each platform). [...] The platforms are staggered, either side of a <b>half-barrier</b> level crossing and each has level access from the road. [...] No ticket machine is provided, so passengers must buy tickets in advance or on the train.|$|E
50|$|The line is classed as a {{high-speed}} line because {{the sections of}} the line from Birmingham to Wakefield and from Leeds to York have a speed limit of 125 mph, though the section from Birmingham to Bristol is limited to 100 mph due to there being numerous level crossings, especially <b>half-barrier</b> level crossings, and the section from Wakefield to Leeds is limited to 100 mph due {{to a number of}} curves.|$|E
50|$|Because {{signals are}} {{provided}} for travel in this direction, the Pilotman {{has only to}} explain to the driver what is taking place. He must state which line is being used for single line working, and between which crossovers it is taking place. If there is an Automatic <b>half-barrier</b> (AHB) crossing under local control on the route, the driver may only pass over it if there is a handsignaller displaying a green flag or lamp to him.|$|E
50|$|The {{station is}} a request stop for trains running from Shrewsbury to Swansea. Those wishing to alight or board the train here must alert the driver/conductor of the train. However, {{passenger}} trains running from Swansea to Shrewsbury stop here mandatorily, {{as the train}} has to stop before the level crossing. For trains from the Swansea direction, the level crossing is activated by the traincrew using a cabinet on the platform. From 1977 to 2014, the level crossing was ungated, but following a number of near-misses (such as 12 recorded incidents in 2011), <b>half-barriers</b> were installed in spring 2014, and fully commissioned on 28/29 April 2014.|$|R
50|$|In 1974, {{the track}} was rebuilt with continuously-welded rail. The {{platforms}} between Eidelstedt and Kaltenkirchen were raised to a uniform height of 76 cm and extedended to {{a length of}} 100 metres. Crossings were abolished or secured with <b>half-barriers.</b> This allowed the travel time between Kaltenkirchen and Eidelstedt to be reduced to between 38 and 44 minutes. A central signal box was put into operation in Ulzburg Süd in 1976 and signal boxes were also installed in Quickborn, Hamburg-Schnelsen and Kaltenkirchen (from 1982). Since 1983, they work with microprocessors instead of relay technology. Signalling on the line began to be controlled from an electronic interlocking in Kaltenkirchen from 2002. The entire route was converted by 2005.|$|R
5000|$|After World War 2 the {{railways}} were nationalised and Bealings station {{became part of}} British Railways' Eastern Region. Lack of patronage saw the station close in September 1956 and the goods yard followed in April 1965. The signal box (opened in 1884 with 18 levers for signals and points) [...] remained in use, however, as a block post to divide up the Westerfield-Woodbridge section and to operate the level crossing gates. The box lasted until 1984, when it was closed {{as a result of}} the introduction of RETB (Radio Electronic Token Block) signalling on the East Suffolk line; at the same time, the manual level crossing gates were replaced by the current automatic <b>half-barriers.</b> The station building is still extant today, and is occupied by the Mallard Business Centre.|$|R
50|$|In the United Kingdom, {{automatic}} <b>half-barrier</b> {{level crossings}} (AHB/AHBC) are used on roads where traffic {{is unlikely to}} queue across the crossing and where rail line-speed is not more than 100 mph. Other than the train driver's line of sight, which is less effective at night, railway signalling control and train drivers have no means of knowing whether this level crossing (and many others) are clear. Half barriers close the crossing to road traffic but allow any road user on the crossing to escape {{without the need for}} a local controller to raise the barriers.|$|E
5000|$|Amenities at {{the station}} are basic (despite it {{being one of the}} largest towns served on the route), with no ticket {{provision}} of any kind (these must be bought on the train or prior to travel). As well as the aforementioned shelter and a bicycle rack, there is a customer help point {{at the station}} entrance and a digital CIS display to provide real-time train running information. [...] Northbound trains must stop here in order for the train crew to activate the controls for the <b>half-barrier</b> level crossing, but for southbound trains it is a request stop.|$|E
50|$|Many gated {{crossings}} {{have been}} replaced by lifting barriers, which are easier to mechanise. These consist of barriers each side of the track which block the full width of the road and had two red lights that alternatively flashed, as well as an audible alarm or bell. In 1955 various European automatic crossings were visited and checked by two inspecting officers and two road engineers from the Ministry of Transport, as well as two officers from the British Transport Commission visited 46 crossings in 10 days in three countries. The report was signed on 14 March 1957, and automatic and automated crossings came into use, with the first automatically operated level crossing commencing operation at Spath near Uttoxeter in Staffordshire in May 1961. Automatic <b>half-barrier</b> crossings later came into being after another enquiry abroad in 1963, consisting of a single arm each side of the road, which block only oncoming traffic leaving the exits clear for trapped occupants. Half barriers were considered to have an advantage as they have a lesser closure time and do not require to be interlocked with signals, but cases where impatient motorists have driven around the barriers have raised safety concerns. On lightly-used railways such as the Heart of Wales Line, many crossings are sited next to station stops or other stopping points, and were made to be crew operated. The guard pushes a plunger to operate the crossing, and on completion of the crossing sequence, the train can cross. These trainman operated crossings (TMOs) still exist today.|$|E
50|$|The first {{crossing}} {{of this type}} in the UK was installed {{in the town of}} Spath, near Uttoxeter in Staffordshire, and began operating on 5 February 1961. These crossings have two <b>half-barriers</b> that block the entrance lanes to the crossing, as well as lights and audible alarms. They are entirely independent and do not interlock with signals, although they are monitored by a signaller to check for any failures. In existence since the first automatic crossings, they are common on back lanes, but are becoming less common at stations, because they are not as safe as a MCB crossing. 100 mph is the maximum line speed over these crossings and only a maximum of two lines can be crossed. Network Rail is trying to make AHBCs safer by adding the brand of speaking E2S alarms to crossings, in order to alert drivers and persons using the {{crossing of}} second trains approaching, as many drivers become impatient at these crossings.|$|R
25|$|Following the two fatal {{accidents}} in 2003 and 2005, the railway began a programme of level crossing refurbishment. There {{are a number}} of occupation crossings with local control, where the railway meets farm tracks, but of the eighteen junctions of the railway with public highways, five are road bridges and the other thirteen are level crossings. During the late 1970s to early 1980s, all thirteen had been converted to automatic open crossings (AOCLs) by installation of flashing warning lights. Between 2006 and 2016, twelve of them were upgraded to Automatic Barrier Crossing Locally Monitored (ABCL) status. This involved the decommissioning of the life expired AOCL control equipment, the installation of lifting <b>half-barriers</b> and totally new control and train detection systems, at a cost of around £90,000 per crossing.) On 22nd of March 2017 the crossing at Romney Sands was commissioned as an ABCL, this means that all the 13 crossings on the line have barriers and it brought the level crossing upgrade program to a close. During the single line crossing upgrades the Road Signal heads (Wig Wags) have either been replaced with new ones (Battery Road and Dungeness Road) or had their existing heads refurbished.|$|R
40|$|Based on an {{extended}} Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB, Ajzen, 1985, 1991), we conducted surveys inorder {{to explain and}} predict violations at a railroad crossing, among pedestrians (n = 153) and car drivers(n = 151). Measures were made with respect to three chronologically related railroad crossing situationsthat varied in risk level. The situations were described in scenarios and depicted on photographs. Theparticipants were recruited {{in the suburbs of}} Paris, at two automated railroad crossings with four <b>half-barriers.</b> We found that the pedestrians had stronger crossing intentions than did car drivers, especiallyat the more congested crossing of the two under study. For both categories of road users, intentions andthe amount of intention variance explained by the extended TPB factors decreased significantly with risklevel. In the most dangerous situations, risk-taking was the most unlikely and the least predictable Self-reported past frequency of crossing against safety warning devices was the main predictor of the intentionto commit this violation again, especially among males, followed by the attitude and the injunctive normin favor the violation. Moreover, car drivers were influenced in their crossing intentions by the descriptivenorm. The presence of another vehicle on the tracks when the safety warning devices were activated wasperceived not as facilitating, but as an additional risk factor. The discussion addresses the importance oftaking into account these determinants of violations in conceiving countermeasures. Our findings couldbe especially useful for conceiving risk-communication campaigns...|$|R
40|$|The work at hand {{presents}} the results of an analysis of 51 accidents at German level crossings regarding human error contribution on the part of road traffic users. The results indicate that a <b>half-barrier</b> protection does not provide a strong enough barrier effect to prevent accidents. It is shown that overall 41 % of all accidents in the sample happened at such <b>half-barrier</b> level crossings, thus making up for the second largest share following light signal system layouts. Accidents at full-barrier protected level crossings and level crossings without technical protection in the sample are negligible. The findings from the investigation of human error types leading to accidents at <b>half-barrier</b> level crossings are of particular interest. Using the GIDAS framework for human error categorisation in the automotive domain, they reveal that 73 % of errors occur in the planning stage of human information processing. Violations of rules like deliberately bypassing closed barriers are most prevalent. Countermeasures to minimise the occurrence of such accidents at <b>half-barrier</b> level crossings are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Increasingly {{demanding}} {{community noise}} targets are promoting noise performance ever {{higher on the}} list of airliner design drivers. In response, significant noise reductions are being made, though at a declining rate—it appears that a whole airframe approach is now needed to achieve significant further gains. As a possible step in this direction, over-wing engine installations are considered here, which use the airframe itself as a noise shield. The paper is the account of an experimental investigation of the comparative shielding performances of a range of relative engine positions on such a layout. Using the statistical modelling technique Kriging, we build an approximation of the noise shielding metric {{as a function of the}} position of the engines above the wing—this can serve as the input to multi-disciplinary design trade-off studies. We then compare the results found with the results of applying simple <b>half-barrier</b> diffraction theory to the same problem. We conclude that the latter could be considered as a first order, conceptual design tool, though it misses certain features of the design merit landscape identified by the experiment presented here...|$|E
40|$|The {{aircraft}} {{industry has been}} at the forefront in developing design optimization strategies ever since the advent of high performance computing. Thanks to the large computational resources now available, many new as well as more mature optimization methods have become well established. However, the same cannot be said for other stages along the optimization process - chiefly, and this is where the present thesis seeks to make its first main contribution, at the geometry parameterization stage. The first major part of the thesis is dedicated to the goal of reducing the size of the search space by reducing the dimensionality of existing parameterization schemes, thus improving the effectiveness of search strategies based upon them. Specifically, a refinement to the Kulfan parameterization method is presented, based on using Genetic Programming and a local search within a Baldwinian learning strategy to evolve a set of analytical expressions to replace the standard 'class function' at the basis of the Kulfan method. The method is shown to significantly reduce the number of parameters and improves optimization performance - this is demonstrated using a simple aerodynamic design case study. The second part describes an industrial level case study, combining sophisticated, high fidelity, as well as fast, low fidelity numerical analysis with a complex physical experiment. The objective is the analysis of a topical design question relating to reducing the environmental impact of aviation: what is the optimum layout of an over-the-wing turbofan engine installation designed to enable the airframe to shield near-airport communities on the ground from fan noise. An experiment in an anechoic chamber reveals that a simple <b>half-barrier</b> noise model {{can be used as a}} first order approximation to the change of inlet broadband noise shielding by the airframe with engine position, which can be used within design activities. Moreover, the experimental results are condensed into an acoustic shielding performance metric to be used in a Multidisciplinary Design Optimization study, together with drag and engine performance values acquired through CFD. By using surrogate models of these three performance metrics we are able to find a set of non-dominated engine positions comprising a Pareto Front of these objectives. This may give designers of future aircraft an insight into an appropriate engine position above a wing, as well as a template for blending multiple levels of computational analysis with physical experiments into a multidisciplinary design optimization framework.
