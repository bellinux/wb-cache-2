50|$|In the Factory, Lana {{approaches}} the <b>Dessicator</b> {{and sees the}} Heart standing next to it. He criticizes her for never settling down even when she had everything, however Lana retorts that she refuses {{to live in a}} world where people have to fight for the will to live. At this point the Heart says that she is just like her mother, implying that he is her father. Lana steps onto the <b>Dessicator.</b> Her goal is to overload the <b>Dessicator</b> with wild energy so that it breaks and the Factory doesn't have to kill people anymore to provide energy. Despite her best efforts to maintain her own rhythm despite the membrane filling her with antivibration, she starts weakening. At this point all of her companions jump onto the membrane and each of them starts doing their best to maintain their own rhythm by performing anything that fills them with wild energy such as dancing and playing on drums. The battle starts going much better as the <b>Dessicator</b> starts overloading, but Lana realizes that they won't be able to keep it up for long enough. Suddenly, the Heart jumps onto the center of the membrane and starts channeling his own wild energy. As the <b>Dessicator</b> absorbs him. it overloads, leaving the Heart a pile of ashes and the <b>Dessicator</b> broken. Afterwards Lana sees off her friends by putting them on the same cart that the Heart used to take to the city.|$|E
5000|$|At first, Lana is imprisoned {{inside a}} room with a {{foldable}} TV screen with only 3 channels, one of which only works for 20 minutes a day and displays the same telescreen that she used to work in. Soon, the Heart begins to trust her more and lets her out and shows her around. He shows her the view {{from the top of the}} factory and shows her the wires running from the factory in the direction of the city. He explains that via these wires, each power up, everybody hooks themselves up to the factory which gives them energy. Lana is on the verge of committing suicide, but the Heart convinces her the life is worth living. He explains that he himself came to the Factory attempting to change something after his wife died due to lack of energy before giving birth to their daughter, but realized that the Factory must keep running in order to keep everybody living, but with less and less wild people, the Factory won't be able to last forever and give everyone energy. He shows Lana several other things. He shows her a computer that he can use to control what is being said on the 20 minute telescreen presentation all the way in the city. He also shows her a cart in the basement of the Factory which runs on the energy of mating slugs. Lana deduces that he uses this cart to get back to the city. The Heart also explains how the <b>Dessicator</b> works. He tells her that the <b>Dessicator</b> is the [...] "oven" [...] of the factory. It's a membrane that will detect the natural vibration of a person, and cause an anti vibration that fills the person, turning them to ashes and leaving the person's pure energy behind which is then absorbed by the factory. His description reminds Lana of the fire pit on which Lana fought with the Queen Mother, and the Heart explains that the fire pit actually transferred all of the Queen Mother's energy into Lana upon Lana's victory.|$|E
5000|$|Once {{every couple}} of days, a cable car arrives with new wild people. The Heart and Lana always sit {{together}} as they feel the Factory shudder as the <b>Dessicator</b> does its work. The Heart explains that he journeys to the city primarily to see the happy synthetics in order to demonstrate to himself that the work he's doing matters. Eventually, Lana hatches an escape plan. She takes the foldable TV screen the Heart gave her, runs into his room and types a message into his computer [...] "Factory is real, devours human energy. Don't trust the Controllers/Catchers. Search for SYNT - Lana". She sends this message to the telescreen where it is displayed to the entire city. She then runs {{up to the top}} of the Factory, with the Heart in pursuit, and then jumps off, using the foldable screen to glide over the antirhythm and out of the Factory. Once outside, she is able to follow a water flow back into the Factory and into the tunnel with the cart used to get back to the city. She activates the cart, however the Heart was expecting this and didn't tell her that she needed to flip a lever in the tunnel, which causes the cart to return to the Factory. The Heart recaptures her, however after more planning Lana decides to escape again. This time she jumps onto a cable car as it's leaving. Suddenly, the cable car conductor is called and asked to look for stowaways. He sees Lana hanging off the side of the car, but chooses not to report her. He drops her off before the cart enters the precinct, and Lana ends up back in the city.|$|E

The as-prepared ceramic powder was calcined at 600 &# 176;C {{to remove any}} organic residuesafter the spray pyrolysis process. Different milling methods for the calcined powderswere attempted, revealing dry planetary milling {{to be the most}} suitable milling method. The powders were characterised using scanning electron microscopy. A complete millingprocess was developed based on sufficient destruction of the egg-shell like agglomerates from the spray pyrolysis process, avoidance of flake formation and reproducibility. Sintering was attempted using three different sintering methods, all using the reverse crucible method to limit the amount of alkali evaporation. An optimal temperature range was found for each of the three, achieving densities in the range of 94 - 97 %. The microstructure of the different samples was explored by polishing the samples and investigating the surfaces by scanning electron microscopy. It was found that the average grain sizes were in the range of a few microns, with large variations in the broadness of the grain size distribution when comparing different sintering methods. For two of the three sintering methods a standard deviation of less than 0. 3 micron is reported. An EDS analysis was performed, and it was found that all the samples demonstratecompositional homogenity. Dielectric testing was performed on the samples sintered using the three differentsintering methods. Polishing of the sample surfaces and storage in <b>dessicators</b> had tobe performed in order to avoid moisture influence and achieve reproducibility. Thepiezo- and ferroelectric effect was observed for all the different sintering methods, along with coercive fields in the range of 669 - 889 Vmm and remnant polarizations in the range of 16 - 29 C/cm 2, depending on the sintering method used. A strictly monotonic relationship between average grain size and the coercive field was identified. The normalized strain d* 33 was found to be in the range of 230 - 330 pm/V, after poling using an electric field of 4 kVmm at 100 &# 176;C.

40|$|Abstract. The goal of {{the present}} work was to {{investigate}} the effects of several cement preparation parameters on setting and hardening reaction mechanisms and hydroxyapatite (HA) cement properties. A central composite experimental design (CCD) was conducted by choosing particle size, solid to liquid ratio, pH, seed concentration and buffer concentration as design parameters along with compressive strength and setting time being the responses. Tetracalcium phosphate (TTCP) powders were prepared by heat treatment of calcium and phosphate source mixtures in the 1200 - 1400 oC temperature range followed by quenching to room temperature in a <b>dessicator.</b> The second phase used in the formulations (brushite) was prepared by aqueous chemical methods. A series of HA pastes/cements were prepared by changing the above mentioned design parameters. Cements were characterized by a standardized setting time test, mechanical testing machine, SEM and XRD. HA cements with the desired properties can be formulated by using CCD in which the responses were expressed by a second order polynomial equation of the parameters.

However, most research has not focused on the copolymer itself in regards to how long it can be used effectively and if varying the concentrations of polylactic acid (PLA) and polyglycolic acid (PGA) affect the resulting properties. Electrospinning is the method we use to create the three-dimensional constructs, or “scaffolds”, for the blood vessel mimic (BVM) in the tissue engineering lab. The aim of our project was to investigate if the morphology and mechanical properties of the scaffolds changed over time when they were stored in a <b>dessicator.</b> In addition, the morphology and properties from 75 : 25 and 85 : 15 PLGA copolymers were studied to determine whether there were significant differences in fiber diameter, elastic modulus, or critical yield strength between them via Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) image analysis and tensile testing of the samples. These same three parameters were analyzed for the distal, medial, and proximal regions of the scaffold for each concentration of PLGA. The main significant finding was that the regions of the scaffold were relatively uniform in their properties. No timepoints were established, since there was such large variation in the data and the trends were inconsistent.

40|$|Bacterial colonies are {{spatially}} complex structures whose physiology {{is profoundly}} dependent on interactions between cells {{and with the}} underlying semi-solid substratum. Here, we use bacterial colonies {{as a model of}} a microbial community to evaluate the potential of laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) to delineate elemental distributions within colonies with minimal pre-treatment. To reduce water content of the colony and limit undesirable absorption of laser energy, we compared methods of preparing 24 h-old colonies of Escherichia coli TG 1 on agar for laser ablation. Colonies on excised agar segments dried on chromatography paper were superior to colonies dried in a <b>dessicator</b> or by prolonged incubation, with respect to signal magnitude, signal:noise ratio and background signal. Having optimised laser scan speed (10 μm s− 1) and laser beam diameter (100 μm), further improvements were achieved by growing colonies on nylon membranes over agar, which were then transferred to the ablation chamber without further treatment. Repeated line rasters across individual membrane-supported colonies yielded three-dimensional elemental maps of colonies, revealing a convex morphology consistent with visual inspection. By normalising isotope counts for P, Mn, Zn, Fe and Ca against Mg, the most abundant cellular divalent cation, we sought elemental heterogeneity within the colony. The normalised concentration of Mn in the perimeter was higher than in the colony interior, whereas the converse was true for Ca.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} a simple routine procedure to preserve, decarbonate and analyse low-carbonated filters of suspended particulate organic matter (POM) for particulate organic carbon and nitrogen content, δ 13 C and δ 15 N. Our goal was to analyse these four parameters from a single and entire filter of POM without altering the organic material. First, freezing (- 20 °C) versus oven-drying (60 °C) were compared as the initial preservation step. Afterwards, non-acidified samples were compared to acid-treated samples using 0. 12 N HCl (diluted HCl rinsing at the end of the filtration) or 12 N HCl (filters exposed to HCl fumes for four hours in a <b>dessicator).</b> Regarding the preservation methods, our results indicate that freezing increases the uncertainty of δ 15 N measurements and, in combination with concentrated HCl treatment, leads to a loss of particulate nitrogen and an alteration of the δ 15 N signature. Consequently, we recommend drying to preserve filter samples. Regarding acid treatments, we found that (i) diluted HCl would not be sufficient to fully remove the carbonate from our samples, (ii) in contrast, a four-hour exposure of the filters to the HCl fumes was enough to remove all the inorganic carbon, and (iii) the concentrated HCl treatment did not alter the nitrogen measurements (only when drying without freezing is used to preserve the filters). Consequently, we propose that low-carbonated POM filters are preserved by drying and carbonates are removed by exposing the filters to HCl fumes (four hours) for the analysis of particulate organic C and N content and isotope ratios...|$|E

In an effort to develop a smooth and rapid polyester polymerization method, reactions between DNPCl and both DINOL and REX- 18 have been carried out in THF containing pyridine. It was expected that the pyridine would act as an HCl acceptor, permitting room temperature polymerizations. This was indeed shown to be the case. In fact, when the glycol and DNPCl were dissolved in THF and pyridine added rapidly, a very exothermic reaction took place, with copious quantities of pyridine hydrochloride being precipitated. Slow addition of pyridine to the reaction mixture also resulted in an exotherm. In both cases, brown polymers were produced and they were very difficult to work-up. The next series of polymerizations will be carried out at 0 {degrees}C in an effort to control the polymerizations more carefully and avoid color formation.

40|$|Background and Aim: Water {{sorption}} and solubility {{are important}} properties of acrylic resins. Denture base acrylic resins have low solubility. This solubility {{results from the}} leaching out of unreacted monomer and water soluble additives into the oral fluids. The solubility of denture bases can cause oral soft tissue reactions. In addition, water absorbed into this material acts as a plasticizer and decreases the mechanical properties such as hardness, transverse strength, fatigue limit and also can change the color and dimensional stability. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the water sorption and solubility of Acropars and Meliodent heat cure acrylic resins. Materials and Methods: This experimental study was performed on the basis of ADA specification No. 12 and ISO No. 1567 and standards NO: 2571 of Institute of Standards & Industrial Research of Iran. Six disc form samples of each acrylic resin were prepared, with the dimension of 50 × 0. 5 mm. After desiccating, the samples were kept in an oven for 24 hours and weighed. Then they were immersed in water, kept in oven for 7 days and weighed again. After this phase, the samples were carried to a <b>dessicator,</b> for 24 hours and kept in an oven for drying and were weighed for the third time. Data were analyzed with Mann Whitney and one sample t-test. P< 0. 05 was considered as the limit of significance. Results: Water sorption mean values were 30. 5 ± 0. 1 µg/mm 3 or 0. 76 ± 0. 01 mg/cm 2 for Meliodent samples and 30. 7 ± 0. 87 µg/mm 3 or 0. 77 ± 0. 009 mg/cm 2 for Acropars samples. No significant difference was observed in water sorption of these two materials (P= 0. 9). Meliodent acrylic resin showed lower solubility (1. 7 ± 0. 097 µg/mm 3 or 0. 042 ± 0. 001 mg/cm 2) than Acropars acrylic resin (2. 5 ± 0. 13 µg/mm 3 or 0. 062 ± 0. 001 mg/cm 2) (P= 0. 002). Conclusion: Acropars heat cure acrylic resin matched well with the requirements of the international standards for water sorption, but its solubility was not favorable. This problem is probably the result of high concentration of residual monomer, the amount and type of cross linking agents and plasticizers as well as the amount of water soluble additives in this material...|$|E
40|$|From Valentine et al, 1968. Biochemistry 7 : 2143 - 52 ### Rationale: For {{the highest}} {{resolution}} with negative staining, {{there should be}} little or no support film, but some support is necessary to hold the protein. In this method the proteins are supported by a carbon film and "embedded" in a film of uranyl acetate. The film is cast on mica, which provides the cleanest possible surface for the carbon. 1. Freshly cleave a piece of mica, coat with a carbon film using the vacuum evaporator. - Put ~ 30 mg/ml protein solution in a small vessel. - Cut the mica to 3 - 4 mm 2 pieces. Hold a piece with forceps and push into the solution of protein at a 30 - 45 degree angle. Do not let the film detach completely from the mica. - Let the film sit on the protein solution for 20 - 40 seconds. - Pull the mica back and allow the film {{to sit on the}} mica. - Then slide the mica and film onto a solution of 1 - 2 % uranyl acetate or uranyl sulfate. Pick up the film with a copper grid, dry, and examine in the electron microscope. ### Variations: A more stable film can be obtained if you pick up the film on a grid coated with a holey formvar film. A wrinkled carbon film may be better than a smooth one, as it seems to keep pools of uranyl acetate around the protein better than smooth films. Try varying the protein concentration for optimal staining. The proteins should be closely spaced to collect the stain but if they are too crowded proteins will be overlapped and will not be easily resolved. The carbon support film should be as thin as possible (3 - 10 nm) and should be prepared on freshly cleaved mica. Once the carbon coated mica has been prepared it can be stored in a <b>dessicator</b> almost indefinitely. Thicker support films will lower image contrast. Stain solution should be removed from below the surface of a stock stain solution to avoid contaminants from precipitates that may exist at the surface or the bottom of the stock solution. The precipitates do not affect the overall quality of the staining procedure but will result in local heating of the support film when exposed to the electron beam, which in its most benign form will result in drift, and at its worst will result in a ripping and curling of the support film. The carbon support film should only be exposed to proteins that exist in the bulk solution and must not be exposed to denatured material that is usually present in the meniscus. The greatest potential source of contamination and the one most often ignored is the contamination that arises from the tweezers and the support grid. At no time should the tweezers or the support grid be dipped into either the protein solution or the negative staining solution...|$|E

The organisation and biophysical properties of the biological membrane surrounding fat globules in milk are poorly known and need further investigation to better understand their technological and biological functions. The milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) is the interface between the triacylglycerol core of milk fat globules and their aqueous environment. This membrane {{is important for the}} physical stability of fat globules and is involved in the mechanisms of milk fat globule digestion in the gastrointestinal tract of mammal newborns. The MFGM is essentially composed of polar lipids (of which 30 % mol is milk sphingomyelin; MSM), cholesterol and membrane proteins. The lateral segregation of polar lipids characterised by high phase transition temperature (e. g. the MSM with Tm= 34 °C but also DPPC) has been revealed in the external bilayer of the MFGM and interpreted as the formation of “lipid rafts” at the surface of the milk fat globule (Lopez et al., 2010). The properties of rafts in the biological cells, and the interactions between cholesterol and sphingolipids such as sphingomyelin, {{have been the subject of}} many studies (Simons and Vaz, 2004). Increasing knowledge about the role of cholesterol in the physical characteristics of the high Tm lipid domains formed in the MFGM is of primary interest. Previous results indicated that the cholesterol strongly impacted on the lateral packing of the MSM in MSM/DOPC/cholesterol bilayers (Guyomarc’h et al., 2014). The objectives of this study were to investigate the role of cholesterol on the lipid domains formed in the MFGM, using Langmuir-Blodgett monolayers probed at the nanoscale using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) to characterise the structural details. b) Materials & methods. Investigations of lipid heterogeneities have been performed using a MFGM lipid extract (39 % MSM, 32 % PC, 24 % PE, 3 % PI, 3 % PS). MFGM lipid extracts with 0 to 50 % mol. of cholesterol to the milk sphingomyelin (MSM) were prepared in methanol/chloroform then deposited at the air-water interface of a Langmuir trough containing PIPES buffer at 20 °C. The lipids were compressed to 30 mN/m at 5 cm 2 /min, transferred at constant pressure onto freshly cleaved mica then dried in a <b>dessicator</b> for at least 3 days. Imaging was conducted with an MFP- 3 D Asylum Research AFM at room temperature. c) Results & discussion. Monolayers of MFGM lipids showed the formation of domains, which have been interpreted as the lateral segregation of high Tm lipids form the other lipids (polar lipids containing unsaturated fatty acids and forming the fluid phase surrounding the domains). The lipid domains formed in the absence of added cholesterol (Fig. 1, left), had a µm-large size and protruded above the continuous phase by ~ 1. 4 nm height step. As the proportion of cholesterol was increased (Fig. 1), the domains were clearly more numerous while decreasing both in area and in height step, the latter being only ~ 0. 9 nm from 35 % mol cholesterol onwards. This indicated that cholesterol scattered and fluidified the lipid domains into the continuous fluid phase (Milhiet et al., 2001). Langmuir compression isotherms were recorded and clearly evidenced the condensing effect of cholesterol onto the MFGM polar lipids, most probably the MSM (Simons and Vaz, 2004) ...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{high-performance}} properties of glass-fiber-reinforced polymer composite materials are not simply the sum of the properties of their constituents. The properties of composites depend on the ability of the interface to transfer stress from the matrix to the reinforcement. In fact, it is at the interfacial region where stress concentrations develop because of differences in the thermal expansion coefficients between the reinforcement and the matrix phase due to loads applied to the structure, cure shrinkage (in thermosetting matrices), and crystallization (in some thermoplastic matrices). Coupling agents have two different functionalities that are designed to chemically bond with the reinforcement at one end and the organic matrix at the other. The most commonly used coupling agents are bifunctional organosilicon compounds named silanes. The silane coupling agents of most commercial glass fibers have three hydrolyzable alkoxy functional groups. These groups allow the silanes to react {{with each other and with}} the glass to form a multilayer network on the glass surface. In order to study the effect of moisture absorption by the glass-fiber surface to the bulk epoxy, we used FTIR imaging to investigate this problem. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies of the epoxy/glass fiber interface using the “FTIR imaging” technique. This technique uses a focal-plane array detector (FPA) coupled with a step scan interferometer to improve FTIR microscopic measurements, yielding spatially resolved spectroscopic information in the infrared region. In addition, this technique allows one to obtain consecutive IR images of the microscopic region of interest in intervals of time less than 5 min. For this reason, the FTIR imaging can be used to study the evolution of several components at the same time in specific sites in the sample. The composite was fabricated using the conventional HAND LAYOUT method. The materials used are E-Glass Fiber and Epoxy resin (araldite LY 556). The hardener used is HY 951. A sixteen layered structure was formed as per the ASTM standards. The fiber and the matrix were taken in the ratio of 50 : 50. The sample was left for drying for 24 Hrs after the fabrication so that the matrix completely seeps in and become dry. The samples after cutting and oven drying were divided into 3 parts. One part is kept as such and was wrapped in Aluminium foil and stored in the <b>Dessicator</b> after weighing all the samples. Second and third part were first weighed and then given a hygrothermal treatment by placing the samples in the humidity chamber for 50 Hrs and 100 Hrs respectively at 50 °C and 95 % humidity. After ithe Hygrothermal treatment, the dimensions of all the samples were measured and then they were being tested for 3 -Point Bend Test. Then the samples were characterized using FTIR- maging and he fractured surface was studied by SEM. The ILSS value increases with initial moisture absorption due to the relief of residual stresses but after a certain stage it decreases due to the loss of adhesion between matrix and fiber. The ILSS value increases with the strain rate but after a certain stage it decreases because the matrix is unable to transfer load properly i. e. ILSS value is low at low strain rate as well as high strain rate as at low strain the load is applied for more time and thus the specimen fails at low stress value and at high strain rate, the time available for transfer of load is insufficient and the load acts as an impact and thus specimen fails at low stress. Thus the rate of loading should be optimum. The FTIR-IMAGING Results Shows that the moisture absorption is more at the interface in low Hrs treatment as the components of composites have the property to absorb moisture and then moisture absorption is more in matrix due to more debonding leading to creation of voids at the interface and thus the water diffuses in easily through the interface to matrix. The SEM Images of the fractured surfaces shows that the initial moisture absorption results in the increase in the bond strength as the matrix gets squeezed but after a saturation stage, the moisture absorption results in the debonding of the matrix-interface bond and also matrix- matrix bond and thus ILSS value initially increases and then decreases...|$|E
40|$|Les pratiques de {{fertilisation}} et d'amendement peuvent contribuer à modifier profondément les propriétés des sols. Ceci est mis en évidence par le dispositif des 42 parcelles de l'INRA à Versailles qui reçoit chaque année les mêmes traitements depuis 1929. Il présente l'originalité d'être en jachère nue. Les résultats reportés ici reposent sur 16 traitements que nous comparons à une parcelle témoin. Le sol est à caractère limoneux avec 14 à 22 % d'argile. Le pH, la capacité d'échange au pH du sol (CECsol), et les cations échangeables ont été mesurés. Des mesures de porosité, de rétention de l'eau à différents potentiels de l'eau ont été effectuées. Des variations considérables de pH sont observées. Les engrais ammoniacaux conduisent à des parcelles très acides (pH 3, 5 à 5, 0), à faible CECsol, essentiellement saturée par des cations aluminium. Dans les parcelles chaulées ou recevant des amendements basiques, le pH est tamponné à 8, 2 par les carbonates. La CECsol double du sol acide au sol chaulé où {{elle est}} majoritairement saturée par du calcium échangeable. Avec les sels neutres (par exemple KCl, NaNO 3) le pH n'a pas changé et pour le témoin il a légèrement baissé. Des observations de terrain montrent que ces différents états physico-chimiques sont en relation avec les états de surface du sol et influencent la porosité du sol en profondeur. Ainsi dans les sols des régions tempérées la CECsol peut doubler dans un domaine très restreint de pH (6, 0 à 7, 5), orientant fortement les propriétés physiques des sols. In temperate regions, soil acidification {{is a real}} problem. The pH change causes transformations of both the chemical and physical properties of the soil. The 42 experimental plots at the Institut national de Recherche agronomique (INRA) in Versailles, France, were created in 1929. Since that time, each plot has received either fertiliser or amendments (Table 1). There are ten reference plots {{that have not been}} treated. Plots were dug up twice a year and left fallow. The results corresponding to 17 plots, 16 treated and one reference plot, are presented in this paper. The samples were collected in 1999 and compared to the 1929 soil reference. The pH was measured in water (AFNOR 1994), the cation exchange capacity (CEC) was determined at pH 7. 0 (AFNOR 1994, CEC 7) and at the soil pH by the cobaltihexamine method (Ciesielski and Steckermann 1997, CECsoil). Exchangeable cations (Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, K+ and Na+) were measured after cobaltihexamine extraction and exchangeable aluminium by the KCl method (McLean, 1965). Water retention measurements were carried out with an apparatus developed by Tessier and Berrier (1979) and AFNOR (1996) at - 10 kPa, with the Richards pressure plate cell at - 1. 6 kPa (Richards 1948) and with a controlled hygrometry <b>dessicator</b> at - 107 MPa (Tessier 1984). The average pH of the reference plot collected in 1929 was close to 6. 3. In 1999, pH values ranged between 3. 5 and 8. 2. For plots treated with ammonium fertilisers the pH ranged from 3. 5 to 5. 5. In contrast, plots with basic treatment or liming had a soil pH that was close to 8. 2 and was equilibrated with carbonates. Intermediate pH values (from 5. 5 to 7. 5) were obtained for plots treated with neutral salts such as KCl or NaNO 3, or with superphosphate. The cation exchange capacity in soils at the reference pH (7. 0) demonstrated variations in soil composition. For example, the CEC 7 varied with clay content as a function of depth or with organic matter loss or gain due to lying fallow or to manure application. When the CEC was measured at soil pH (CECsoil), strong differences were observed. Two groups of plots can be differentiated in 1999. One ranged between 11 and 16 cmol+/kg; this range corresponded to plots with amendments or with fertilisers containing bases. A lower range of CECsoil values (below 11 cmol+ /kg) was obtained with ammonium fertilisers. It {{is important to note that}} between pH= 6. 0 and pH= 7. 5 the CECsoil doubled. Six months after digging, the surface state of the soil was variable. Thick crusts dominated in acidic conditions, whereas the presence of dispersing cations (K+, Na+), and a smooth surface was present in soil treated with amendments. In the soil profile, bulk density increased with acidity and sodium or potassium cation concentrations. At - 10 kPa, water retention measurements demonstrated that bulk density and sampling depth were linked with water retention: the higher the bulk density, the lower the water retention. At - 1. 6 MPa, water retention was correlated to the amount of clay and organic matter content. We also showed that the exchangeable calcium content and CECsoil influence water retention. At - 107 MPa, water retention depends on pH as well as the CECsoil and exchangeable cation concentration. The main purpose of this study was to show that after 70 years, plots subjected to intensive fertilisation or amendments and lying fallow (i. e., without organic matter restitution), have dramatically different soil properties. The first indicator of this evolution was pH. Ammonium fertilisers produced very acid plots (pH 3. 5 to 5. 0). In the presence of neutral salts (e. g., KCl, NaNO 3) and in the reference plot, the pH had decreased a little. In liming or basic treatment plots, the pH is controlled at 8. 2 by carbonates. The second important factor to consider is the cation exchange capacity value. When measured at a reference pH (pH= 7. 0), the CEC 7 reflects the natural components present in a soil, but doesn't consider the influence of physico-chemical factors that operate in the native soil. After 70 years without organic restitution, the soil has lost approximately half of its original organic matter content, and as a result the exchangeable sites were approximately 2 cmol+ /kg. The effective CEC at soil pH demonstrates the influence of pH on variable charges due to mineral constituents and organic matter. Plots with ammonium fertilisers have a low cation exchange capacity. Fertilisers with sodium and potassium cations have increased the exchangeable sodium (up to 11 % of the CECsoil) or potassium (18 %) respectively. The cation exchange capacity doubled in going from acidic plots to liming plots, and in the latter the CEC is mainly saturated with exchangeable calcium. In situ plot observations show that soil physico-chemical properties strongly influence not only soil surface state, but also soil profile porosity. Both acidification and dispersing cations are factors in soil degradation, whereas high pH values and calcium as the exchangeable cation produce strong structure stability and high porosity. It is also interesting to note that the CECsoil can double between pH= 6. 0 and pH= 7. 5, thus influencing the physical properties of the soil. Comparing CEC 7 and CECsoil facilitates the prediction of the effects of fertilisation and amendments on soil properties. The cation exchange capacity at soil pH can be used as an excellent indicator of soil quality...|$|E
