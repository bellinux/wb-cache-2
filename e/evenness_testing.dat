The principle of capacitive evenness tester Uster and the measurement method are described in this paper. The influences of operating environment and the measuring conditions on determining the unevenness of polyester POY filament are discussed.

The temperature evenness of heat pipe using magnetic nano-fluids as the working medium and the traditional heat pipe were comparative analysised at the simulation environment of permafrost regions with low temperature. The experiment {{results show that the}} heat pipe using magnetic nano-fluids as the working medium has better thermal conductivity, less heat transfer temperature difference, and the more heat transfer ability, more widely applicable temperature range, more applicable to the life and the higher working efficiency. The results provide a new idea to develop higher efficiency heat pipe having the better temperature evenness...|$|R
40|$|Random testing (RT) is a {{fundamental}} software testing technique. Adaptive random testing (ART), an enhancement of RT, generally uses fewer test cases than RT to detect the first failure. ART generates test cases in a random manner, together with additional test case selection criteria to enforce that the executed test cases are evenly spread over the input domain. Some {{studies have been conducted}} to measure how evenly an ART algorithm can spread its test cases with respect to some distribution metrics. These studies observed that there exists a correlation between the failure detection capability and the <b>evenness</b> of <b>test</b> case distribution. Inspired by this observation, we aim to study whether failure detection capability of ART can be enhanced by using distribution metrics as criteria for the test case selection process. Our simulations and empirical results show that the newly proposed algorithms not only improve the <b>evenness</b> of <b>test</b> case distribution, but also enhance the failure detection capability of ART...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} be able to {{quantify}} yarn <b>evenness,</b> <b>testing</b> instruments were developed, based on different methods and progressively improving their performance. Most of them use principle based on drawing the yarn under test between the plates of a condenser, so that the yarn and the air are the dielectric material that changes the capacitor characteristics, which is proportional to the mass of small lengths of the yarn (8 mm). Knowledge of the yarn mass in 1 mm range is of most importance to evaluated properly the yarn evenness; furthermore several irregularities can only be properly detected of this mass evaluation is possible in this range. In this paper, a study is presented in order to achieve mass variation in 1 mm length. Simulation results are presented and compared with Uster Tester III.

40|$|The {{longitudinal}} {{profile of a}} road pavement represents by definition a simplification of the ride plane surface characteristics along a vertical section, which is not necessarily repeated identically in different parallel transverse paths. The execution of <b>evenness</b> <b>tests</b> on single alignments thus does not always prove to be suitable for representing the effective functional characteristics of road surfaces, especially in urban areas where the presence of localized irregularities becomes a primary factor in road pavement evaluation. The research described in this paper {{is an extension of}} a previous study investigating the effects of randomness or stability of the profilometric surveys of road surfaces along parallel longitudinal alignments, referred to five different urban contexts. Alignments were located with a transverse step of 0. 50 m to guarantee 10 surveys for each surface. The acquisition and successive numerical processing of the profilometric data also allowed the stability to be verified of the evenness indexes currently used in a transverse direction (IRI, RN, RMS), contributing towards emphasizing how much the choice of alignments can sometimes be highly determining on the final result of pavement evaluations...|$|R

40|$|Adaptive Random Testing (ART) was {{developed}} to enhance the failure detection capability of Random Testing. The basic principle of ART is to enforce random test cases evenly spread inside the input domain. Various distribution metrics {{have been used to}} measure different aspects of the <b>evenness</b> of <b>test</b> case distribution. As expected, it has been observed that the failure detection capability of an ART algorithm is related to how evenly test cases are distributed. Motivated by such an observation, we propose a new family of ART algorithms, namely distribution metric driven ART, in which, distribution metrics are key drivers for evenly spreading test cases inside ART. Our study uncovers several interesting results and shows that the new algorithms can spread test cases more evenly, and also have better failure detection capabilities...|$|R
40|$|Reductions in {{community}} evenness {{can lead to}} local extinctions as dominant species exclude subordinate species; however, herbivores can prevent competitive exclusion by consuming otherwise dominant plant species, thus increasing evenness. While these predictions logically result from chronic, gradual reductions in evenness, rapid, temporary pulses of dominance may also reduce species richness. Short pulses of dominance can occur as biotic or abiotic conditions temporarily favour {{one or a few}} species, manifested as increased temporal variability (the inverse of temporal stability) {{in community}} <b>evenness.</b> Here, we <b>tested</b> whether consumers help maintain plant diversity by reducing the temporal variability in community <b>evenness.</b> We <b>tested</b> our hypothesis by reducing herbivore abundance in a detailed study of a developing, tallgrass prairie restoration. To assess the broader implications of the importance of herbivory on community evenness as well as potential mechanisms, we paired this study with a global herbivore reduction experiment. We found that herbivores maintained plant richness in a tallgrass prairie restoration by limiting temporary pulses in dominance by a single species. Dominance by an annual species in a single year was negatively associated with species richness, suggesting that short pulses of dominance may be sufficient to exclude subordinate species. The generality of this site-level relationship was supported by the global experiment in which inter-annual variability in evenness declined in the presence of vertebrate herbivores over timeframes ranging in length from 2 to 5  years, preventing declines in species richness. Furthermore, inter-annual variability of community evenness was also negatively associated with pre-treatment species richness. Synthesis. A loss or reduction of herbivores can destabilize plant communities by allowing brief periods of dominance by one or a few species, potentially triggering a feedback cycle of dominance and extinction. Such cycles may not occur immediately following the loss of herbivores, being delayed until conditions allow temporary periods of dominance by a subset of plant species...|$|R
40|$|Aims Community {{assembly}} {{rules are}} poorly understood, especially in subalpine areas. Plant communities {{are thought to}} be organized from a regional species pool through environmental filtering and competition. Environmental filtering will result in the formation of groups of species with similar traits, while competition will limitsimilarity of coexisting species. Environmental filtering and competition can also affect community phylogenetic structure when species niches are phylogenetically conservative. Our object was to uncover how these processes affected community assembly and their responses to grazing. Methods We sampled plant communities in six sites across a grazing gradient and calculated functional group <b>evenness</b> to <b>test</b> effects of environmental filtering and competition. For investigating community phylogenetic structure, we calculated nearest taxon index and net relatedness index using phylocom software. We examined community phylogenetic structures and functional group evenness under a grazing gradient using null model and phylogenetic indexes. Important findings We found strong nonrandom patterns in species richness distributions among functional groups in non-grazed plots, and functional group evenness significantly decreased with increased grazing pressure. There was a significant phylogenetic cluster in intensively grazing communities and this gradually became dispersion toward primary forest. As a filtering effect, grazing increased species richness of a few lineages and decreased others. This process resulted in community phylogenetic cluster or reductions in functional group evenness. Functional group evenness increasing and phylogenetic over-dispersion might stem from competition, which could limit similarity of coexisting species. Results indicated that both habitat filter and competition simultaneously shaped community structure. Findings suggest that grazing affected functional group evenness and phylogenetic structure through changing the balance between environmental filtering and competition in communities. The negative relationship between functional group evenness and species richness suggests that competition might suppress plant diversity in local communities. Results support that species functional divergenceand their competition have important roles in community assembly...|$|R
40|$|Biodiversity {{experiments}} typically {{vary only}} species richness and composition, yet the generality of their results relies on consistent {{effects of these}} factors even under varying starting conditions of density and <b>evenness.</b> We <b>tested</b> this assumption in a factorial species richness x density x evenness experiment using a pool of 60 common grassland species divided into four functional groups (grasses, legumes, tall herbs and short herbs). Richness varied from 1, 2, 4, 8 to 16 species, total planting density was 1, 000 or 2, 000 seeds/m 2, and species were sown in even or uneven proportions, where one functional group was made dominant. Aboveground plant biomass increased linearly with the logarithm of species richness in all density and evenness treatments during all {{three years of the}} experiment. This was due to a convergence of realized density and evenness within species richness levels, although functional groups which were initially made dominant retained their dominance. Between species richness levels, realized density increased, and realized evenness decreased with species richness. Thus, more individuals could coexist if they belonged to different species. Within species richness levels, higher biomass values were correlated with lower density, suggesting an underlying thinning process. However, communities with low realized evenness also had low biomass values; thus high biomass did not result from species dominance. So-called complementarity and selection effects were similar across density and evenness treatments, indicating that the mechanisms underpinning the biodiversity effects were not altered. Species richness was the dominant driver of aboveground biomass, irrespective of variations in total densities and species abundance distributions {{at the start of the}} experiment; rejecting the hypothesis that initial differences in species abundance distributions might lead to different “stable states” in community structure or biomass. Thus, results from previous biodiversity experiments that only manipulated species richness and composition should be quite robust and broadly generalizable...|$|R
40|$|Random testing (RT) is a {{basic and}} simple {{software}} testing technique. However, it is controversial whether RT is an effective method to detect software failures. Based on the common observation that inputs revealing software failures tend to cluster into contiguous regions, adaptive random testing (ART) has been proposed to enhance the failure-detection capability of RT. The basic intuition of ART is to evenly spread random test cases over the whole input domain. This thesis investigates a number of topics about such an “even spread” intuition. It has been generally believed that how evenly an ART algorithm spreads test cases {{has an impact on}} how effectively it detects software failures, and an even distribution of test cases brings a good failure-detection capability. This thesis investigates some existing ART algorithms, and proposes several families of new ART algorithms. Some simulations are conducted and the experimental results show that these new algorithms significantly enhance the failure-detection capability of ART. Test case distributions of these new ART algorithms are also examined, and it is observed that there is a strong correlation between the <b>evenness</b> of <b>test</b> case distribution and the failure-detection capability of an ART algorithm. All previous studies have used the failure-detection capability to measure the effectiveness of ART. This thesis proposes two new measurements to evaluate the performance of ART, which are also correlated to the even spread of test cases. One measurement is the coverage achieved by ART. A series of experiments are conducted in this thesis, and it is shown that test cases selected by ART can cover the program under test more thoroughly than those generated by RT. It is further observed that the more evenly test cases are spread, the higher coverage an ART algorithm can achieve. The other measurement proposed in this thesis is the mutant-killing capability of ART. Mutants refer to a set of fault-seeded programs derived from a basic program, and killing a mutant means detecting a failure in the mutant. Experimental results show that ART generally kills more mutants than pure RT, and the mutant-killing capability of ART becomes better with the improvement of the even spread of test cases. In summary, this thesis significantly contributes to the research on ART, especially to the areas related to the basic “even spread” intuition of ART...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study a total of 325 {{groupers}} belonging to the species Epinephelus coioides (195), E. areolatus (60) and E. fuscoguttatus (70) from Indonesian coastal marine ecosystems in the Segara Anakan Lagoon (Central Java), Balinese waters and the Thousand Islands were investigated for parasites in 2008 and 2009. A total of 33 different parasite species/taxa belonging to the Ciliata (1), Microsporea (1), Digenea (9), Monogenea (2), Cestoda (4), Nematoda (6), Acanthocephala (2), Hirudinea (1) and Crustacea (7) was found. Furthermore, the morphologically predetermined Anisakis sp. were confirmed as Anisakis typica and Anisakis sp. (HC- 2005) using molecular biological methods. Scatophagus argus (58) from {{inside and outside the}} Segara Anakan Lagoon were studied for additional regional comparisons. In total 13 different parasite species/taxa belonging to the Ciliata (1), Microsporea (1), Digenea (2), Monogenea (1), Cestoda (1), Nematoda (1), Acanthocephala (1) and Crustacea (5) could be listed. Therefore, 41 parasite species/taxa, including 16 ectoparasitic and 25 endoparasitic parasites, could be isolated from all 383 investigated fishes of all sampling sites. These 41 detected fish parasites were taxonomically processed by using different techniques. 20 new host records (E. coioides four, E. areolatus 13, E. fuscoguttatus one and S. argus two new records) und 23 new locality records, mainly from Balinese waters and the coastal zone of the Segara Anakan, Central Java, could be revealed. Because of minor variability within parasite communities of free living and mariculture fishes in stable ecosystems between two years, annual differences can only be indicated over a long-term period. A comparison of the new data with previous investigations (Rückert 2006) of E. fuscoguttatus (2003 / 04 - 2008 / 09) indicates either a broad degradation of the surrounding ecosystem or management changes within the mariculture (Palm et al. submitted). The parameters Evenness of endoparasites, ecto-/endoparasite ratio and endoparasite diversity appear to be especially adequate to reveal differences in the parasite infestation over several years. The parameters endoparasite diversity and <b>Evenness</b> were <b>tested</b> (Trendtest after Neumann) and confirmed a decreasing trend. This trend represents a higher dominance level and decreasing parasite diversity of particular endoparasite species in this mariculture farm from 2003 / 04 to 2008 / 09. This might be due to increasing extraneous causes and/or changes in the facilities management that are directly linked to the occurrence of intermediate hosts and the feed usage, respectively. Accordingly, fish parasites {{have been shown to be}} useful as bioindicators and to monitor culture conditions and environmental status in and around a grouper mariculture farm. It was possible to illustrate regional differences and long-term changes in parasite communities of the studied epinephelids by using visual integration of a variety of parasitological parameters within a stargraph. The utilised parameters have been demonstrated to be useful to indicate a general ecosystem change and also long-term variations. The application of a stargraph can be further developed into a fish parasite based evaluation system that can monitor regional environmental health. Cluster-Analyses and MDS Plots likewise can illustrate such differences but fall short in concluding, in explaining these differences. In contrast, the stargraph method enables visualisation of existing differences and also allows statements concerning the respective environmental change by using a variety of ecological parameters. This method can be helpful to monitor environmental impact and change of grouper finfish mariculture in Indonesia...|$|R
40|$|Anticipating how {{species and}} {{ecosystems}} will react to continued {{climate change is}} of critical importance to biodiversity conservation and to management of the ecosystem processes on which we rely. Identifying how individual species in a community have responded in the past {{can be accomplished by}} evaluating the fossil record on a local and/or regional scale, and by examining spatial patterns of modern abundance and diversity. Here, I explore regional patterns of mammal diversity across the Colorado Plateau (CP), examine local small mammal diversity fluctuations in fossil deposits from northern San Juan County, Utah, through the late Holocene, and assess modern spatial diversity patterns across a range of San Juan County sites. 	Over the past century, extraordinary global transformations have taken place, including climate change and land conversion for human use. With these unusually rapid and extreme global changes underway, it is increasingly important to understand the extent to which designated conservation areas have protected biodiversity thus far, and to gauge their potential for continuing {{to do so in the}} future. Chapter 1 examines the efficacy of biodiversity preservation in National Park Service (NPS) lands of the CP by using analysis of nested species assemblages to compare surveyed mammal communities to the range map predictions of which species should be present. I find that NPS lands are nested, and, although site diversity is correlated with area, elevational range, budget and visitation, a comparison between species lists compiled from surveys versus range map distributions reveals that the biogeographic patterns prevailing today cannot be distinguished from those prevailing when these NPS sites were established. These broad-stroke patterns define an important context in which to direct future conservation efforts as we attempt to divert and mitigate anthropogenic impacts—past, current, and future. 	Modern patterns of diversity are the result of past events and processes that take place on the scale of decades, centuries, and millennia. Detailed paleoecological records from Quaternary deposits are remarkably useful in characterizing these long-term ecological dynamics, but only a handful of Quaternary localities that sample the small mammal community of the CP have been studied to date. In chapter 2, I describe my excavation and analyses of two fossil-bearing alcoves, East Canyon Rims 2 (ECR 2) and Rone Bailey Alcove (RBA) (San Juan County, Utah), and quantify diversity and abundance change of the small mammal community as recorded in the fossil samples. Fossil localities with comparable mammal diversity have not been reported from this region previously, so these sites provide novel insight into Holocene mammal diversity in southeastern Utah. Further, these localities contribute to our understanding of natural variation in this system by providing faunal data for a period of recent climate change—cool-wet to warm-dry. AMS radiocarbon dates on 33 bone samples from these sites span ~ 4. 4 ka-present, and shed light on pre-industrial faunal dynamics in the region over the course of environmental change, most notably aridification. I test for an effect of climate on community evenness and relative abundance of 10 small mammal taxa—leporids, perognathines, small sciurids, arvicolines, Cynomys, Neotoma, Dipodomys, Onychomys, Peromyscus, and Thomomys—and find that, in spite of considerable increases in aridity and temperature, neither is significantly correlated with relative abundance or <b>evenness</b> when statistically <b>tested,</b> but there are qualitative patterns consistent with a response to increasing aridity around 1000 years ago. 	The CP is home to a diverse complement of species that are experiencing increasing temperature and drought stress today. Understanding how mammal communities might be expected to respond to impending global changes requires a baseline of information on presence, abundance, and spatial variation of species on the landscape today. Chapter 3 describes the results of a preliminary analysis of spatial variation in the small mammals of northern San Juan County at a single point in time, with the objective of learning how species commonly preserved in the fossil record sort geographically in relation to variation in their abiotic environment. I conducted mark-recapture surveys at 8 sites in northern San Juan County, two of which were located in the immediate vicinity of ECR 2 and RBA. Over the course of one year, I compiled abundance and presence/absence data on nine species: Neotoma albigula, Onychomys leucogaster, Peromyscus maniculatus, P. truei, Dipodomys ordii, Perognathus flavescens, P. parvus, Ammospermophilus leucurus, and Tamias rufus. In chapter 3, I evaluate spatial differences in species richness using occupancy modeling and metrics of taxonomic difference, and I assess proportional and rank abundance across sites. Although the results are preliminary, some patterns are emerging: sites spanning 50 km and 550 m elevation range sample the same small-mammal species pool, but abundance of those species varies non-randomly, and sites are less similar in abundance than expected by random distribution of individuals. Species evenness varies among sites, and sites with low evenness are dominated by Peromyscus maniculatus, a “weedy” species with broad habitat requirements. This is also the first report of Perognathus parvus east of the Colorado River, suggesting recent range expansion of the species. Occupancy models indicate that presence/absence of different species is determined by different aspects of their environment, and therefore species will respond idiosyncratically to future environmental changes. However, more survey data is necessary before these patterns can be considered robust or fully explained. In chapter 4, I compare fossil diversity at ECR 2 and RBA to modern diversity at the same sites. I find that evenness reached a peak in ECR 2 and RBA between ~ 1 - 1. 7 ka, then began to decline between ~ 0. 7 - 1 ka. Evenness of the modern community at ECR 2 and RBA is also significantly lower than in the fossil record between ~ 0. 7 - 4. 5 ka. The observed drop in evenness occurred prior to the onset of high-impact, post-European human land uses, like livestock grazing, and is coincident with the time when Ancestral Puebloan populations crashed due to long-term periodic droughts, suggesting a marked environmental change between ~ 0. 7 - 1 ka. Low modern evenness is consistent spatially—modern evenness at all survey sites is lower than it is for all fossil time bins ~ 0. 7 ka and older, suggesting that this was a landscape-level decline in diversity. These results send a cautionary message: though the basic taxonomic integrity of the small mammal community is still present, abundance and community structure are very different today. 	Additional information on past and current diversity of the CP will improve forecasting and establish baselines against which to compare future surveys, allowing us to gauge rates and direction of change, and to prioritize conservation efforts in the future. This study emphasizes the enormous utility of the fossil record in understanding the extent of ecological fluctuations that can be considered “normal” through long periods of time, information which is essential as we struggle to conserve biodiversity in a rapidly changing world...|$|R
