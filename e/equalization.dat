5|$|Some systems use {{parametric}} <b>equalization</b> in {{an attempt}} to correct for room frequency response irregularities. <b>Equalization</b> is often unable to achieve flat frequency response at all listening locations {{in part because of the}} resonance (i.e., standing wave) patterns at low frequencies in nearly all rooms. Careful positioning of the subwoofer within the room can also help flatten the frequency response. Multiple subwoofers can manage a flatter general response since they can often be arranged to excite room modes more evenly than a single subwoofer, allowing <b>equalization</b> to be more effective.|$|E
5|$|Buckner {{proposed}} {{a number of}} progressive ideas, {{most of which were}} rejected by the legislature. Among his successful proposals were the creation of a state board of tax <b>equalization,</b> creation of a parole system for convicts, and codification of school laws. His failed proposals included creation of a department of justice, greater local support for education and better protection for forests.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s and 1980s {{there was}} a dispute over the {{valuation}} of the power plant between HL and the Dickinson Independent School District (DISD). In 1979 HL said the plant was worth $238 million but DISD's board of <b>equalization</b> said it was worth over $242 million. A legal dispute ensued between the two agencies.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} election, Knott {{defeated}} Republican Thomas Z. Morrow {{by a margin}} of nearly 45,000 votes. During his term in office, he asked the legislature to conduct a thorough reform of the state's tax system, but the legislators' only response was to create a board of <b>equalization</b> charged with making equitable tax assessments. The legislature also refused to grant the Railroad Commission all the powers Knott had requested.|$|E
5|$|Rihanna's {{recording}} sessions {{took place}} at Sun Studios in Dublin, Ireland. Marcos Tovar mixed her vocals, which were engineered by Spike Lindsey and mastered from Detroit over the Internet. The American songwriter Makeba Riddick provided additional vocal production. Strange used <b>equalization,</b> compression and reverberation but left the vocal balance. He assumed that Rihanna was satisfied with her recorded vocals and did not make major changes on her seven stereo vocal tracks.|$|E
5|$|According to the California Secretary of State, the Democratic Party holds a voter {{registration}} advantage in every congressional district, state senate district, state assembly district, State Board of <b>Equalization</b> district, all nine counties, {{and all but}} three of the 101 incorporated municipalities in the Bay Area. On the other hand, the center right Republican Party holds a {{voter registration}} advantage in only one state assembly subdistrict (the portion of California's 4th State Assembly district in Solano county) and three cities, Atherton, Hillsborough, and Danville. According to the Cook Partisan Voting Index (CPVI), congressional districts the Bay Area tends to favor Democratic candidates by roughly 40 to 50 percentage points, considerably above the mean for California and the nation overall.|$|E
5|$|During {{his first}} year in office Williams and his {{government}} suffered low approval ratings. However, approval for Williams and his government dramatically improved in 2005. A poll showed support for the Williams government was at 86 percent after Williams secured a deal with Federal Prime Minister Martin over <b>equalization</b> payments. The CRA poll in March 2006 showed 82 percent satisfaction with his government and 71 percent in William's premiership. Polling conducted throughout 2007, showed that support for Williams and his government remained high. In August 2007, the CRA found that 86 percent were satisfied with the government's performance; 77 percent supported Williams as premier, and 76 percent endorsed the PC party.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald {{consistently}} {{called for}} a more equitable redistribution of wealth, so that poorer provinces such as Nova Scotia, could share fully in Canada's prosperity. Biographer Stephen Henderson writes that Macdonald deserves credit for the introduction, in 1957, of an <b>equalization</b> scheme designed to enable poorer provinces to provide comparable levels of services to their citizens. Macdonald's advocacy of provincial autonomy however, fell victim to the centralizing tendencies of a post-war welfare state in which the federal government increasingly assumed greater control over national social programs.|$|E
5|$|Canada is a {{federation}} {{composed of}} ten provinces and three territories. In turn, {{these may be}} grouped into four main regions: Western Canada, Central Canada, Atlantic Canada, and Northern Canada (Eastern Canada refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together). Provinces have more autonomy than territories, having responsibility for social programs such as health care, education, and welfare. Together, the provinces collect more revenue than the federal government, an almost unique structure among federations in the world. Using its spending powers, {{the federal government can}} initiate national policies in provincial areas, such as the Canada Health Act; the provinces can opt out of these, but rarely do so in practice. <b>Equalization</b> payments are made by the federal government to ensure that reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.|$|E
5|$|Giant impacts {{are thought}} to have been common in the early Solar System. Computer {{simulations}} of a giant impact have produced results that are consistent with the mass of the lunar core and the present angular momentum of the Earth–Moon system. These simulations also show that most of the Moon derived from the impactor, rather than the proto-Earth. More recent simulations suggest a larger fraction of the Moon derived from the original Earth mass. Studies of meteorites originating from inner Solar System bodies such as Mars and Vesta show that they have very different oxygen and tungsten isotopic compositions as compared to Earth, whereas Earth and the Moon have nearly identical isotopic compositions. The isotopic <b>equalization</b> of the Earth-Moon system might be explained by the post-impact mixing of the vaporized material that formed the two, although this is debated.|$|E
5|$|Strange {{arranged}} the Pro Tools session {{in a more}} traditional manner by laying out the drums, bass instruments, guitars, keyboards, main vocals and overdubs from left to right. While mixing, he began with drums, then the main vocals. He added the chorus and bridge, followed by other instrumentation. Strange mixed the track to satisfy Eminem, who, after entering the studio, made his own adjustments, providing additional production; by then, Resto's tracks were added. Strange made adjustments to Boi-1da's tracks, using SSL <b>equalization</b> (EQ) and some compression. To keep the track in tune from pitch fluctuation, Strange used Trim and Auto-Tune on Resto's TR-808 kick. Strange arranged reverberation tools, including the Bricasti, Eventide 2016, the Lexicon 480, Lexicon PMC70, and the Yamaha SPX90.|$|E
25|$|In March 2013, polls {{suggested}} that 47% of Brazilians supported marriage <b>equalization</b> and 57% supported adoption <b>equalization</b> for same-sex couples.|$|E
25|$|Further, {{even after}} officially agreeing to {{implement}} the RIAA <b>equalization</b> curve, many recording labels continued {{to use their own}} proprietary <b>equalization</b> even well into the 1970s. Columbia is one such prominent example in the USA, as are Decca, Teldec and Deutsche Grammophon in Europe.|$|E
25|$|Can easily {{adapt to}} severe channel {{conditions}} without complex time-domain <b>equalization.</b>|$|E
25|$|In a sense, {{improvements}} in FIR <b>equalization</b> using FFTs or partial FFTs leads mathematically closer to OFDM, but the OFDM technique {{is easier to}} understand and implement, and the sub-channels can be independently adapted in other ways than varying <b>equalization</b> coefficients, such as switching between different QAM constellation patterns and error-correction schemes to match individual sub-channel noise and interference characteristics.|$|E
25|$|The {{interactions}} {{of the air}} and water flow allow a partial <b>equalization</b> of temperature, and evaporation of water.|$|E
25|$|A {{basic problem}} with this {{explanation}} is that the Serrano decision and school finance <b>equalization</b> were actually quite popular among California voters. It is true that Californians who voted for Proposition 13 were less likely than other voters to support school finance, but Proposition 13 supporters were not more likely to oppose the Serrano decision, and on average they were typically supportive of both the Serrano decision and of school finance <b>equalization.</b>|$|E
25|$|The 2013 {{property}} tax rate for Washington Township was $2.328 per $100 of assessed value, with an <b>equalization</b> ratio of 97.57%.|$|E
25|$|As the RIAA curve was {{essentially}} an American standard, it had little impact outside the USA {{until the late}} 1970s when European recording labels began to adopt the RIAA <b>equalization.</b> It was even later when some Asian recording labels adopted the RIAA standard. In 1989, many Eastern European recording labels and Russian recording labels such as Melodiya were still using their own CCIR <b>equalization.</b> Hence the RIAA curve did not truly become a global standard until the late 1980s.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} labels {{are used for}} level {{attenuation}} potentiometers (knobs) in a guitar amplifier and other guitar equipment. Electric guitars and basses have a volume control on the instrument that attenuates the signal from selected pickups. There may be two volume controls on an electric guitar or bass, wired in parallel to mix the signal levels from the neck and bridge pickups. Rolling back the guitar's volume control also changes the pickup's <b>equalization</b> or frequency response, which can provide pre-distortion <b>equalization.</b>|$|E

25|$|Requires the {{creation}} of a risk <b>equalization</b> pool that will allow qualifying plans to minimize the impact of adverse selection of enrollees among the plans.|$|E
25|$|Tone stages {{may also}} provide {{electronic}} effects—such as <b>equalization,</b> compression, distortion, chorus, or reverb. Amplifiers may use vacuum tubes (called valves in Britain), solid-state (transistor) devices, or both.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} frequency-selective channel conditions, for example fading caused by {{multipath}} propagation, {{can be considered}} as constant (flat) over an OFDM sub-channel if the sub-channel is sufficiently narrow-banded (i.e., if the number of sub-channels is sufficiently large). This makes frequency domain <b>equalization</b> possible at the receiver, which is far simpler than the time-domain <b>equalization</b> used in conventional single-carrier modulation. In OFDM, the equalizer only has to multiply each detected sub-carrier (each Fourier coefficient) in each OFDM symbol by a constant complex number, or a rarely changed value.|$|E
25|$|No single {{method is}} {{considered}} safest or most successful in <b>equalization</b> {{of the middle}} ear pressure. Using alternative techniques may improve the success individually when a technique fails.|$|E

25|$|Property tax issues dogged L'Enfant Plaza in {{the late}} 1980s. In 1981, L'Enfant Plaza and its {{constituent}} buildings and shopping mall was the city's most expensive property, valued at $78 million. In 1985, the assessor's office in the District of Columbia Department of Finance and Revenue valued the hotel at $83.7 million. Eastern Realty challenged the valuation, and the D.C. property tax Board of <b>Equalization</b> and Review reduced the assessment to $65.1 million. Eastern Realty still felt the valuation was too high, and asked a D.C. Superior Court to lower the structure's value to just $44.5 million. The court declined to overturn the <b>equalization</b> board's ruling. In 1986, the tax valuation was set at $98.5 million, but after an appeal and the assessment dropped to $62.1 million. The 1987 assessment was $93.2 million, but when the <b>equalization</b> board refused to reduce the assessment Eastern Realty sued.|$|E
25|$|If {{differential}} modulation such as DPSK or DQPSK {{is applied to}} each sub-carrier, <b>equalization</b> can be completely omitted, since these non-coherent schemes are insensitive to slowly changing amplitude and phase distortion.|$|E
25|$|Immunity to fading and inter-symbol {{interference}} (caused by multipath propagation) is achieved without <b>equalization</b> {{by means of}} the OFDM and DQPSK modulation techniques. For details, see the OFDM system comparison table.|$|E
25|$|For example, Duncan {{maintained}} that the prevailing interpretation of the state’s Teacher-Training <b>Equalization</b> Fund greatly favored the University of Alabama at API’s expense, even consigning API to second-class status.|$|E
25|$|If the {{response}} is somewhat uniform across all listening positions using these methods, <b>equalization</b> {{can be used to}} shape the bass response to the desired target and further smooth out any remaining ripple.|$|E
25|$|Heckscher and Ohlin {{considered}} the Factor-Price <b>Equalization</b> theorem an econometric success because the {{large volume of}} international trade in the late 19th and early 20th centuries coincided with the convergence of commodity and factor prices worldwide.|$|E
25|$|R.T. Sanderson {{has also}} noted the {{relationship}} between Mulliken electronegativity and atomic size, and has proposed a method of calculation based on the reciprocal of the atomic volume. With a knowledge of bond lengths, Sanderson's model allows the estimation of bond energies {{in a wide range}} of compounds. Sanderson's model has also been used to calculate molecular geometry, s-electrons energy, NMR spin-spin constants and other parameters for organic compounds. This work underlies the concept of electronegativity <b>equalization,</b> which suggests that electrons distribute themselves around a molecule to minimize or to equalize the Mulliken electronegativity. This behavior is analogous to the <b>equalization</b> of chemical potential in macroscopic thermodynamics.|$|E
25|$|The factor <b>equalization</b> theorem (FET) {{applies only}} to the most {{advanced}} countries. The average wage in Japan was once as big as 70 times the wage in Vietnam. These wage discrepancies are not normally in {{the scope of the}} H–O model analysis.|$|E
25|$|In {{order for}} an {{electrostatic}} discharge to occur, two preconditions are necessary: firstly, a sufficiently high electric potential between two regions of space must exist, and secondly a high-resistance medium must obstruct the free, unimpeded <b>equalization</b> {{of the opposite}} charges.|$|E
