5|$|I think <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{woman to}} play a marshal in a movie western. Roger would often cast against type in those days. I could never resist a plum role like a lady marshal in a genre that would never have {{considered}} such a gender reversal like that before. However, working with Roger was always an adventure and this film was no exception.|$|E
5|$|The German {{occupation}} of Luxembourg in World War <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> of two military occupations of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg by Germany {{in the twentieth}} century. From August 1914 {{until the end of}} World War I on 11 November 1918, Luxembourg was under full occupation by the German Empire. The German government justified the occupation by citing the need to support their armies in neighbouring France, although many Luxembourgers, contemporary and present, have interpreted German actions otherwise.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} carrier <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> planned {{aircraft carrier}} conversion {{project of the}} German Imperial Navy (Kaiserliche Marine) during World War I. The Imperial Navy had experimented previously with seaplane carriers, though these earlier conversions were too slow to operate with the High Seas Fleet and carried an insufficient number of aircraft. I was intended to carry between 23 and 30 aircraft, including fighters, bombers, and torpedo-bombers.|$|E

5|$|We've {{always thought}} Lutz {{was the first}} one to sell it. But it's like how people claim they saw Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game or were at Woodstock. The {{landscape}} is littered with salesmen who say, 'Oh yeah, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> one to bring that in.' The first PBR I ever had was at the Jockey Club, this really old-school punk-rock bar on Killingsworth. As far as the very first ones, there was the Lutz and EJ's, and it's always been our thought that Lutz was first.|$|E
5|$|Thutmose <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{king who}} {{definitely}} {{was buried in}} the Valley of the Kings. Ineni was commissioned to dig this tomb, and presumably to build his mortuary temple. His mortuary temple has not been found, quite possibly because it was incorporated into or demolished by the construction of Hatshepsut's mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahri. His tomb, however, has been identified as KV38. In it was found a yellow quartzite sarcophagus bearing the name of Thutmose I. His body, however, may have been moved by Thutmose III into the tomb of Hatshepsut, KV20, which also contains a sarcophagus with the name of Thutmose I on it.|$|E

25|$|Rama I, {{the first}} {{king of the}} Chakri dynasty, {{continued}} the traditions of Ayutthaya in many respects.

25|$|The {{earliest}} pharaohs of the Middle Kingdom traced {{their origin}} to two nomarchs of Thebes, Intef the Elder, who served a Heracleopolitan pharaoh of the Tenth Dynasty, and his successor, Mentuhotep I. The successor of the latter, Intef <b>I,</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> Theban nomarch {{to claim a}} Horus name and thus the throne of Egypt. He is considered the first pharaoh of the Eleventh Dynasty. His claims brought the Thebans into conflict with the rulers of the Tenth Dynasty. Intef I and his brother Intef II undertook several campaigns northwards and finally captured the important nome of Abydos.|$|E
25|$|During the Somali Civil War, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney {{committed}} Canada to UNOSOM I after United Nations Security Council Resolution 751. UNOSOM <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{part of the}} UN's response {{effort to}} provide security and humanitarian relief in Somalia, while monitoring UN-brokered ceasefires. Canadian forces, under the name Operation Deliverance, participated in the American-led Operation Restore Hope. In May 1993 the operation came under UN command and was renamed UNOSOM II. By its end, the mission {{had turned into a}} political disaster for the Canadian Forces. During the humanitarian mission Canadian soldiers tortured a Somali teenager to death, leading to the Somalia Affair. Following an inquiry, the elite Canadian Airborne Regiment was disbanded and the reputation of the Canadian Forces suffered within Canada.|$|E
25|$|The Pergamene kingdom {{founded by}} Philetaerus at the {{beginning}} of the 3rd century BC was initially part of the Hellenistic Seleucid empire. Attalus I, successor and nephew of Eumenes <b>I,</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> to achieve full independence for the territory and proclaimed himself king after his victory over the Celtic Galatians in 228 BC. This victory over the Galatians, a threat to the Pergamene kingdom, secured his power, which he then attempted to consolidate. With conquests in Asia Minor at the expense of the weakened Seleucids he could briefly increase the size of his kingdom. A Seleucid counteroffensive under Antiochos III reached the gates of Pergamon but could not put an end to Pergamene independence. Since the Seleucids were becoming stronger in the east, Attalus turned his attention westward to Greece and was able to occupy almost all of Euboea. His son, Eumenes II, further limited the influence of the Galatians and ruled alongside his brother Attalus II, who succeeded him. In 188 BC, Eumenes II was able to create the Treaty of Apamea as an ally of Rome, thus reducing the influence of the Seleucids in Asia Minor. The Attalids were thus an emerging power with the desire to demonstrate their importance to the outside world through the construction of imposing buildings.|$|E
