5000|$|Campbell spearheaded a {{substantial}} redesign of Quill & Quires print publication in 2006, introducing full-colour photography throughout, custom typefaces {{and a new}} logo. He changed the publications trim size for first time in 30 years, reducing it from a tabloid newspaper size (11" [...] x 14") {{to that of a}} standard magazine. One of the chief aims of the redesign was to demonstrate to the book and magazine industries the viability of printing on 100% recycled, <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> <b>paper</b> stock, becoming one of the first magazines in Canada to do so. The debut redesign issue (January 2006) featured contemporary artist and author Douglas Coupland on the cover, reflecting the more modern sensibility inside. The redesign was short-listed for an art direction prize at the Kenneth R. Wilson Awards. Campbell acted as art director for both the print magazine and website for five years before shifting to focus exclusively on digital media.|$|E

In {{this paper}} we {{analysed}} application status and reasons of recycled paper, researched physical properties, mechanical properties, optical properties, chemical properties and printing adaptability of recycled paper and tested the important indexes. The test data was compared with ordinary offset paper {{and there is}} little difference. The result shows recycled paper can be wildly used for offices, book, paper toys etc. Recycled paper is made from waste paper through a variety of processes, such as smashing, decolorizing and pulping. 80 % of its raw material originate from the recycling of waste paper, thus known as <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> <b>paper</b> of low energy consumption and light pollution.

However, the temperature profile for B 15 is the lowest implying that the heat released is much lower than the other blends.

The Green Living Study consisted of a mail survey of 1186 South East Queensland residents and an online survey of a further 451 individuals, primarily from South East Queensland, and explored the predictors of <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> behaviour.

40|$|Abstract: The {{realization}} of thermal comfort {{through the use}} of refrigerated-based air conditioning systems is largely impeded by poverty and epileptic power supply. Furthermore, the use of some refrigerants has negative effect on the environment. Evaporative cooling systems are viable options for achieving thermal comfort because, apart from their low cost and power requirement, they are <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly.</b> This <b>paper</b> attempts to determine the viability of using direct evaporative coolers to achieve human thermal comfort in several West African cities characterized by different climates using the feasibility index method. Employing the concept of the feasibility index reveals the suitability of using evaporative coolers in Agadez, Bamako, Diffa, Jos, and Nema while Conakry, Gagnoa and Port Harcourt are not recommended for the use of evaporative coolers. Evaporative coolers are therefore suitable alternative to refrigerated-based air conditioning systems for achieving human thermal comfort in these areas and in similar areas with high evaporative cooling potentials...|$|R
