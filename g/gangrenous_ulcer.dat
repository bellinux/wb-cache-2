40|$|SummaryEcthyma gangrenosum (EG) manifests as a {{skin lesion}} and is {{commonly}} associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa septicemia in immunocompromised patients. Other viral, fungal and bacterial agents can also cause EG. The first clinical observation is grouped vesicles with surrounding erythema. Within a few days, they evolve into a <b>gangrenous</b> <b>ulcer</b> with a black/gray eschar surrounded by an erythematous halo. Herein, we present a patient with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} who developed EG-like lesions due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection {{while he was in the}} intensive care unit...|$|E
40|$|SummaryA 35 -year-old {{woman with}} {{postoperative}} recurrent Graves’ disease {{presented with a}} 5 -day history of a red swelling on the right cheek associated with 4 days of remittent hyperpyrexia. Investigations revealed fever, a <b>gangrenous</b> <b>ulcer</b> on the right cheek, submandibular lymphadenopathy, and thyroid gland enlargement. Her white blood cell count, immunoglobulins, and lymphocyte subsets were unremarkable. Thyroid function tests showed low thyroid-stimulating hormone, high free thyroxine, and elevated radioactive iodine uptake. Repeated pus cultures grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but blood cultures were negative. An ill-demarcated erythematous plaque occurred on the right leg on hospital day 3. She was treated with intravenous antibiotics with topical gentamicin, recombinant bovine basic fibroblast growth factor, and radioiodine therapy with anti-thyroid drugs. The ulcer healed leaving a depressed scar at 35 days after discharge. This patient may represent the first case of P. aeruginosa ecthyma gangrenosum and cellulitis in postoperative recurrent Graves’ disease...|$|E
40|$|A 35 year male {{suffering}} from acid-peptic disease since last 15 years developed multiple, progressive necrotic <b>gangrenous</b> <b>ulcers</b> with pus discharge since one month. He also had cellulites {{and a big}} serpiginous necrotic ulcer of left ring finger resembling decubitus ulcer. Smears of pus from both types of ulcers revealed gram-negative bacilli. Culture of pus from both sites showed growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa. Blood culture was negative. Diagnosis of Echthyma gangrenosum (EG) was established histopathologically as gram-negative bacilli invaded the dermal vessels. Complete cure occurred after 3 months of treatment with different antibiotics; 80 &#x 0025; of ulcers healed with cefadroxyl therapy...|$|R
40|$|Has just {{received}} Smith's letter of 20 February 1792. Thanks for Smith's intention {{to name the}} 'Mucada' timber tree after him and makes further notes on its qualities, also that he sent some of the wood to Alexander Dalrymple [(1737 - 1808) geographer] for possible use in mathematical instruments, and presumes Smith does not approve of naming it after the late Sir John Pringle [(1707 - 1782) military physician] as he previously intended. Remarks on efficacy of a "newly discovered fever-bark" from a 'Swietenia' in curing <b>gangrenous</b> <b>ulcers,</b> sending Smith specimen; refers Smith to Dr [Patrick] Russell for more information [(1727 - 1805) East India Company physician].

30|$|Leaves of {{this plant}} are {{anthelmintic}} and vulnerary; {{used as a}} cicatrizant for <b>gangrenous</b> <b>ulcers,</b> in syphilis and gonorrhea. Leaf juice is used as galactagogue. Poultice of the herb is applied to sores, boils and to relieve stomachache [15]. Moreover, this plant contains flavones, flavonoids, tannin, carotene, carotenoids, ascorbic, tartaric, malic and pectic acids, gum, minerals and their salts [16]. The present research was aimed to investigate the phytochemical constituents, cytotoxic, antibacterial and antioxidant activities of P. zeylanica. To evaluate the antioxidant potential of the tested extract of P. zeylanica, several assay strategies have been implemented in this study. These consists of various in vitro and in vivo assay systems, such as the DPPH (1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl) scavenging assay, cupric reducing antioxidant capacity, ferric reducing antioxidant power, NO scavenging activity, total antioxidant capacity and determination of total phenol and flavonoid content, analgesic activity and anti-inflammatory activity {{in order to understand}} the usefulness of this plant as a functional food as well as in medicine.|$|R
40|$|A 75 -year-old {{woman with}} type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus and peripheral vascular disease is admitted with a <b>gangrenous</b> <b>ulcer</b> of the plantar aspect of her left foot. A surgical con-sultation results in a recommendation for a below-the-knee amputation, but the pa-tient declines the procedure {{on the grounds that}} she has lived long enough and wants to die with her body intact. Her internist, who has known her for 15 years, is con-cerned that she has been increasingly confused over the past year and now appears to be depressed. How should her physician determine whether her decision is a compe-tent one? The Cl inic a l Problem Physicians are required by law and medical ethics to obtain the informed consent of their patients before initiating treatment. 1 Valid informed consent is premised on the disclosure of appropriate information to a competent patient who is permitted to make a voluntary choice. When patients lack the competence {{to make a decision about}} treat-ment, substitute decision makers must be sought. Hence, the determination of wheth-er patients are competent is critical in striking a proper balance between respectin...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} {{clinical}} study of 20 cases of <b>gangrenous</b> <b>ulcers</b> of the scrotum and/or of the penis (Fournier's gangrene) and {{a review of}} previous publications. Even though found mostly in elderly male patients, the disease spares no age group and can involve the external genitalia in neonates and women as well. The disease is a necrotising fasciitis of infective origin and always has a portal of entry of the infecting organisms {{even though it may}} be so trivial as to be undetected. The commonest portals of entry of infection are periurethral sepsis, groin wound sepsis, anorectal sepsis, prostatic sepsis and trauma. The infecting organisms comprise both aerobic and anaerobic organisms such as Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Proteus mirabilis, enterococci, Bacteroides fragilis and anaerobic streptococcus. Fournier's gangrene is probably the same disease as necrotizing fasciitis occurring {{in other parts of the}} body, but modified by the peculiar anatomy of the genitoperineum...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Human pythiosis is an {{emerging}} and life-threatening infectious disease caused by Pythium insidiosum. It occurs primarily in tropical, subtropical and temperate {{areas of the}} world, including Thailand. The aim of this report is to present the first pediatric case of typical vascular pythiosis. Case Presentation A 10 -year-old boy with underlying β-thalassemia presented with <b>gangrenous</b> <b>ulcers</b> and claudication of the right leg which were unresponsive to antibiotic therapy for 6 weeks. Computerized tomography angiography indicated chronic arterial occlusion involving the right distal external iliac artery and its branches. High-above-knee amputation was urgently done to remove infected arteries and tissues, and to stop disease progression. Antibody to P. insidiosum was detected in a serum sample by the immunoblot and the immunochromatography tests. Fungal culture followed by nucleic sequence analysis was positive for P. insidiosum in the resected iliac arterial tissue. Immunotherapeutic vaccine and antifungal agents were administered. The patient remained well and was discharged after 2 months hospitalization without recurrence of the disease. At {{the time of this}} communication he has been symptom-free for 2 years. Conclusions The child presented with the classical manifestations of vascular pythiosis as seen in adult cases. However, because pediatricians were unfamiliar with the disease, diagnosis and surgical treatment were delayed. Both early diagnosis and appropriate surgical and medical treatments are crucial for good prognosis. </p...|$|R
40|$|Phagedena {{is an old}} {{term for}} serious deep, {{necrotic}} and <b>gangrenous</b> skin <b>ulcers.</b> In the past these have been regarded as severe infections. A review of 31 cases revealed that except in cases of Streptococcus pyogenes or Clostridium welchii infection a bacterial of fungal infection {{was only one of}} several factors that {{led to the development of}} phagedenic ulcers. Initiating factors may be a bacterial infection, a debilitated state as a result of immunosuppressive therapy or of such conditions as alcoholism, severe diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease or severe arteriosclerosis, and various types of injury or trauma. Continuing factors include enzymatic mechanisms, the release of toxins from large areas of dead tissue and vascular disorders. In general, antibiotics are of limited value. systemic corticosteroid therapy may be useful in the subacute or chronic case. In acute, spreading, gangrenous phagedena with surrounding erythema, fever and systemic toxic effects, immediate excision of dead tissue may be lifesaving...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aims: Paraneoplastic dermatoses are skin {{disorders}} {{that are}} associated with malignancy. Anaplastic large T-cell lymphoma (ALTCL) has rarely been associated with paraneoplastic skin manifestations such as <b>gangrenous</b> foot <b>ulcers</b> and erythroderma. Methods: We describe a case of ALTCL presenting as a large annular skin rash. The clinical picture, course, and treatment will be discussed along with current hypotheses on the mechanism of paraneoplastic syndromes. Results: Skin manifestations in ALTCL most commonly arise in two distinct ways; either as primary cutaneous lymphoma manifestation or as systemic disease with secondary metastasis. Less commonly, systemic disease causes skin manifestations secondary to a paraneoplastic process without infiltration of malignant cells. This is thought to be mediated by an immunologic reaction to tumor antigen or the result of cytokines and other inflammatory markers produced by the tumor itself. Conclusion: Paraneoplastic dermatoses could be the initial presentations of systemic lymphoma. Knowledge about their association with anaplastic large-cell lymphoma may help with timely diagnosis. In a patient with unexplained dermatosis associated with B symptoms who is unresponsive to topic treatment, an investigation for systemic lymphoma workup is warranted...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Venous ulcers {{of lower}} limbs are often chronic and non-healing, many a time {{neglected}} by {{patients and their}} treating physicians as these ulcers mostly do not lead to amputation as in <b>gangrenous</b> arterial <b>ulcer</b> and also cost much to complete the course of treatment and prevention of recurrence. Materials and Methods: One hundred and twenty two lower limb venous ulcers came up for treatment between May 2006 and April 2009. Only twenty nine cases completed the treatment. The main tool of investigation was the non invasive Duplex scan venography. Biopsy of the ulcer was done for staging the disease. Patients′ choice of treatment was always conservative and as out-patient instead of hospitalisation and surgery, which required a lot of motivation by the treating unit. Results: Out of twenty nine cases, ten cases were treated conservatively and seven (24. 13 %) healed well. Remaining nineteen cases were given surgical modality in which fifteen cases (51. 74 %) were successful. Only seven cases (24. 13 %) failed to heal. Compression stockings were advised to control oedema, varices and pain. Foot care, regular exercises and follow-up were stressed effectively...|$|R
40|$|In the {{management}} of a patient with an ischemic ulcer of the lower extremity, {{it is often difficult}} to de termine clinically whether it will heal with conservative management or will require a disfiguring amputation procedure. We will use the term â€œischemic ulcerâ€ • to denote a skin lesion associated with tissue loss related to arterial disease, rather than using the term as a de scription of the perfusion state of the lesion. The problem is one of significance in that amputations involving the lower extremity account for approximately 0. 5 % of all operations performed in the United States. Moreover, they account for approximately 2 % of all operation in the Veterans AdministratiOn system. In approximately 90 % of these amputations, the indication was <b>gangrenous</b> necrosis or <b>ulcer</b> (1). We have previously investigated the relative perfusion of these so-called ischemic ulcers with Tc- 99 m-labeled microspheres, administered intra-arterially and have found a signifi cant relationship between the ability to develop an in flammatory response with its associated hyperemia, bot...|$|R
