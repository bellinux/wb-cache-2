40|$|In {{previous}} {{work on the}} alternating current impedance of Arbacia punctulata egg suspensions (Cole and Cole, 1936 b), {{it was found that}} the unfertilized egg had a static membrane capacity of 0. 73 /~f. /cm. ~ which was independent of the frequency. On fertilization, the low frequency membrane capacity increased to 3. 1 /~f. /cm. 2 and at intermediate frequencies there was evidence of another capacity element. It was suggested that the fertilization data could be interpreted either by an increased plasma membrane capacity which varied with frequency or by an added high capacity of the fertilization membrane. The latter picture was considered the more probable one, and diagrams of the current flow were subsequently published (Cole, 1937). The present work was undertaken to determine whether or not this explanation was correct. Measurements The impedance of the suspensions was measured over the frequency range from 1 kc.

Sodium, potassium and barium chloride, and potassium iodide have been used at molalities ranging from 10 − 4 to 5. 10 − 3 mole per 1000 gr water. Measurements have been carried out at frequencies varying between 10 and 400 <b>kilocycles</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> Electrode effects were observed in all cases, and corrections according to Oncley's formula were applied. Final results are claimed to be accurate to 0, 5 %. Dielectric constants for extremely dilute solutions were very close to that of pure water. For molalities lower than one millimole per 1000 grs water, dielectric increments were compatible with the theory of Debye and Falkenhagen. At higher concentrations dielectric constants showed a sharp decrease. This may be due to a saturation effect, but this hypothesis should be confirmed by measurements at still higher concentrations.

40|$|The basic {{purpose of}} this work is to {{investigate}} experimentally the phase characteristics of radio waves propagated along {{the surface of the}} earth as proposed by K. A.

This paper is concerned with an extension of this method to a study of hemolysis. EXPERIM~ENTAL PROCEDURE The impedance of a suspension of ceils may be represented as a resistance and a parallel capacitance which, per centimeter cube of suspension, are referred to as the resistivity R (ohms-cm.) and the capacity C (micromicrofarads-cm. - 1) of the suspension. The values of R and C at frequencies between I/ 4 and 2000 <b>kilocycles</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> were measured with a Wheatstone bridge, using a substitution method (I). The electrolytic cell containing the corpuscles is replaced by a similar cell filled with a salt solution of the same resistance and connected in parallel to a condenser (of negligible inductance). The function of the bridge is solely to indicate the existence of electrical equivalence in the two cases. The capacitance of the suspension is obtained by adding the static capacitance of the comparison cell to the capacitance of the parallel condenser. The static capacitance of the comparison cell equals D 9 7. 1 4 ~'K 10 K ~#F where D is the dielectric constant of water (79 at the experimental temperature of 21. 4 °C.), and K is the cell constant.

40|$|Graduation date: 1954 Investigations of {{the effect}} of cold working on the {{internal}} friction of copper have become numerous {{in the last few years}} due to the discovery that part of the internal friction is due to the motion of dislocations in the metal. Most of the investigations so far have been done at frequencies of about 150 <b>kilocycles</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> At these frequencies the internal friction has been found to be amplitude dependent and a function of the amount of cold work performed on the metal. This experiment was performed at a frequency of 54 cycles per second by vibrating the reed transversely in a vacuated symmetrical transducer at room temperature. The reed was annealed by placing it in a vacuum and passing electric current through it so that it was heated to a dull red. This was repeated and the reed was then left in the vacuum until cool. The cold working was done by placing compressive loads of 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 tons on two reeds of the same size. The pressure on each reed would then increase in steps of 1 ton effective load on the total surface area of each reed. It was found that contrary to some theories, the internal friction of the reed was still amplitude dependent and a function of the amount of cold work. The internal friction decreased upon additional cold work after the annealing. As the amount of cold work was increased, the internal friction passed through a minimum and then sharply increased. It is proposed that the thermal currents present in the metal at this frequency remove the free dislocations before the stress starts them oscillating under the influence of the stress. Once the dislocation has been removed it may become a bound dislocation and as such will not enter into the internal friction. Cold working serves to increase the number of free dislocations. The thermal currents simply remove these and as a result there is a decrease in the internal friction. The final increase is believed due to the passing of the yield point. Once this point was passed the resulting disorder and flattening of the grain structure would lead to a rapid increase in the internal friction...|$|E
