25|$|David Malin pioneered {{multiple}} exposure using multiple filters for astronomical photography, recombining {{the images in}} the laboratory to recreate the visual display more accurately. For scientific research, proxies are often used, such as ultra-violet, and color-correction to simulate the appearance to humans. Predictive techniques are also used, to indicate {{the extent of the}} display, a highly useful tool for aurora hunters. Terrestrial features often find their way into aurora images, making them more accessible and more likely to be published by major websites. It is possible to take excellent images with standard film (using ISO ratings between 100 and 400) and a single-lens reflex camera with <b>full</b> <b>aperture,</b> a fast lens (f1.4 50mm, for example), and exposures between 10 and 30 seconds, depending on the aurora's brightness.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Riga-made Minox had a brass chassis {{covered in}} a stainless steel shell, which telescopes to reveal or cover the lens and viewfinder windows, {{as well as to}} advance the film. It was equipped with a parallax correcting viewfinder, which was coupled to a Cooke triplet type Minostigmat 15mm f/3.5 lens. The lens was capable of focusing as close as 20cm, and, due to its small image size, provided such depth of field at <b>full</b> <b>aperture</b> that a diaphragm was deemed unnecessary. The maximum focus zone was about one meter to infinity. In front of the lens was a metal foil curtain shutter, which was itself protected by a window. These were advanced features at the time for any camera, regardless of size.|$|E
2500|$|For some lenses, {{including}} a few long telephotos, lenses mounted on bellows, and perspective-control and tilt/shift lenses, the mechanical linkage was impractical, and automatic aperture control was not provided. [...] Many such lenses incorporated a feature {{known as a}} [...] "preset" [...] aperture, which allows the lens to be set to working aperture and then quickly switched between working aperture and <b>full</b> <b>aperture</b> without looking at the aperture control. A typical operation might be to establish rough composition, set the working aperture for metering, return to <b>full</b> <b>aperture</b> for a final check of focus and composition, and focusing, and finally, return to working aperture just before exposure. Although slightly easier than stopped-down metering, operation is less convenient than automatic operation. Preset aperture controls have taken several forms; the most common has been the use of essentially two lens aperture rings, with one ring setting the aperture and the other serving as a limit stop when switching to working aperture. [...] Examples of lenses {{with this type of}} preset aperture control are the Nikon PC Nikkor 28mm 3.5 and the SMC Pentax Shift 6×7 75mm 4.5.

2500|$|The {{original}} Zenit {{came with}} the sturdy click-stop four-element 3.5/50mm Zeiss Tessar copy under the [...] "Industar" [...] designation. [...] Early aluminium variants made in several different bodies were finely blue-coated, whereas the later mass-produced black version was either partially or un-coated with no visible colour on the glass. They were sharp but gave the typically [...] "foggy" [...] image of an uncoated lens with bright lighting. [...] With the iris ring sitting inside the focussing ring {{it was impossible to}} focus at <b>full</b> <b>aperture</b> followed by stopping down, as this moved the point of focus. [...] What makes these lenses interesting is their very compact [...] "pancake" [...] design. The concept of the makers was to offer a sharp Tessar-type lens of the simplest possible body construction, leaving out all progress made in this field since 1945. [...] The most prominent lens is the 6-element 2.0/58mm [...] "Helios" [...] based on the pre-war Zeiss Biotar (US Patent 1,786,916 (W.Merté, 1930) Zenit also manufactures several Tair lenses in different focal lengths of which some were of 4-element pre-war Zeiss Sonnar design with the cemented second and ultra-fat third element.|$|E

50|$|The {{design is}} based on the {{innovative}} Minolta SR-7 model V camera of 1962, but the principal design is inherited from the original 1958 Minolta SR-2. The SR-T 101 however, has several significant features apart from the TTL meter. The most significant one is perhaps the <b>full</b> <b>aperture</b> metering facility, automatically compensating for the at any time fitted lens' maximum aperture, a feature it took twelve more years for Nikon to accomplish. <b>Full</b> <b>aperture</b> TTL metering was commercially first realised in the brilliant Tokyo Kogaku Topcon RE Super, a feature first realised in a screw mount camera by the introduction of the Olympus Kogaku Olympus FTL, their first full frame 35mm SLR in 1971, but which was abandoned one year later in favour of the remarkable OM system.|$|E
50|$|When {{the shutter}} release is pressed the mirror flips {{up against the}} viewing screen, the {{diaphragm}} closes down (if automatic), the shutter opens and closes, the mirror returns to its 45-degree viewing position (on most or all 35 mm SLRs made since 1970) and the automatic diaphragm re-opens to <b>full</b> <b>aperture.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some common {{features}} of 35mm SLR photography were first {{seen on the}} Topcon RE Super. Among these is the through-the-lens exposure metering. This enabled improved exposure accuracy, especially in close-up macro photography using bellows or extension rings, and in telephotography with long lenses. In addition to this feature, the metering is at <b>full</b> <b>aperture.</b> For this purpose the RE-lensese have an aperture simulator that relays the preset aperture to the exposure meter at <b>full</b> <b>aperture,</b> retaining a bright viewfinder image while determining the correct exposure, avoiding the stop-down method. The meter also works independently of the pentaprism finder, which allows for different viewfinder configurations. The meter cell is actually incorporated in the camera's reflex finder mirror. This was accomplished by milling narrow slits in the mirror surface letting {{a fraction of the}} light through to the CdS cell placed just behind it.|$|E
