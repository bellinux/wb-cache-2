40|$|One of the {{promising}} technologies in {{the features of}} LTE-Advance is relaying. Coverage extensions as well as <b>enhanced</b> <b>throughput</b> gain are attractive {{from the perspective of}} network operators. While functioning in macro overlaid network, relay offers the flexibility of installing randomly (nomadic relay) at places where communication link is congested or emergency. Thus, indoor user performance is improved. However, peak achievable throughput at the access link is limited by the backhaul link rate. The backhaul link will become a bottleneck if the aggregate access link throughput exceeds the backhaul link rate. To avoid this bottleneck it is desirable to identify means to maintain the backhaul link rate above the aggregate access link capacity. To that end, another eye-catching technology is Coordinated Multipoint Transmission/Reception (COMP) where joint transmission from multiple base station or coordinated base stations offer <b>enhanced</b> <b>throughput.</b> In this thesis, two types of COMP technique such as Dynamic Point Blanking (DPB) and Quantized Co-Phasing (QCP) have been applied at relay backhaul. Therefore, improved performance at backhaul in terms of Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) and throughput with and without implementing COMP technique is shown. Consequently, indoor user performance with or without nomadic relay is also analyzed. This thesis task is performed through analyzing two case scenarios such as 3 GPP 5 x 5 building grid model and realistic building layout of University of Stuttgart,Germany. In both case, relay users (RUE) receive resources by Max-Min fairness scheduling. Finally, it is shown that Inter-QCP provides the best output in both cases (3 GPP and realistic building layout) at the backhaul link and in access link...|$|E
