The geometry of stent affects its service performance and ultimately affects its fatigue life. Besides, improper length of balloon leads to transient mechanical injury to the vessel wall and in-stent 0 restenosis. Conventional optimization method of stent and its dilatation balloon by comparing several designs and choosing the best one as the optimal design cannot find the global optimal design in the design space. In this study, an adaptive optimization method based on Kriging surrogate model was proposed to optimize the structure of stent {{and the length of}} stent dilatation balloon so as to prolong stent service life and improve the performance of stent. Methods A finite element simulation based optimization method combing with Kriging surrogate model is proposed to optimize geometries of stent and length of stent dilatation balloon step by step. Kriging surrogate model coupled with design of experiment method is employed to construct the approximate functional relationship between optimization objectives and design variables. Modified rectangular grid is used to select initial training samples in the design space.

It is intended to be used in conjunction with the DOE/MSU composite Materials Fatigue Database. The fatigue testing of composite materials requires the adaptation of standard test methods to the particular composite structure of concern. The stranded fabric E-glass reinforcement used by many blade manufacturers has required the development of several test modifications to obtain valid test data for materials with particular reinforcement details, over the required range of tensile and compressive loadings. Additionally, a novel testing approach to high frequency (100 Hz) testing for high cycle fatigue using minicoupons has been developed and validated. The database for standard coupon tests now includes over 4, 100 data points for over 110 materials systems. The report analyzes the database for trends and transitions in static and fatigue behavior with various materials parameters. Parameters explored are reinforcement fabric architecture, fiber content, content of fibers oriented in the load direction, matrix material, and loading parameters (tension, compression, and reversed loading). Significant transitions from good fatigue resistance to poor fatigue resistance are evident in the range of materials currently used in many blades.

40|$|Thermally {{responsive}} {{shape memory}} alloys (SMA) demonstrate interesting properties like shape memory effect (SME) and superelasticity (SE). SMA {{components in the}} form of wires, springs and beams typically exhibit complex, nonlinear hysteretic responses and are subjected to tension, torsion or bending loading conditions. Traditionally, simple strength of materials based models/tools have driven engineering designs for centuries, even as more sophisticated models existed for design with conventional materials. In light of this, an effort to develop strength of materials type modeling approach that can capture complex hysteretic SMA responses under different loading conditions is undertaken. The key idea here is of separating the thermoelastic and the dissipative part of the hysteretic response by using a Gibbs potential and thermodynamic principles. The dissipative part of the response is later accounted for by a discrete Preisach model. The models are constructed using experimentally measurable quantities (like torque?twist, bending moment?curvature etc.), since the SMA components subjected to torsion and bending experience an in-homogeneous non-linear stress distribution across the specimen cross-section. Such an approach enables simulation of complex temperature dependent superelastic responses including those with multiple internal loops. The second aspect of this work deals with the durability of the material which is of critical importance with increasing use of SMA components in different engineering applications. Conventional S-N curves, <b>Goodman</b> <b>diagrams</b> etc. that capture only the mechanical loading aspects are not adequate to capture complex thermomechanical coupling seen in SMAs. Hence, a novel concept of driving force amplitude v/s number of cycles equivalent to thermodynamical driving force for onset of phase transformations is proposed which simultaneously captures both mechanical and thermal loading in a single framework. Recognizing the paucity of experimental data on functional degradation of SMAs (especially SMA springs), a custom designed thermomechanical fatigue test rig is used to perform user defined repeated thermomechanical tests on SMA springs. The data from these tests serve both to calibrate the model and establish thermodynamic driving force and extent of phase transformation relationships for SMA springs. A drop in driving force amplitude would suggest material losing its ability to undergo phase transformations which directly corresponds to a loss in the functionality/smartness of SMA component. This would allow designers to set appropriate driving force thresholds as a guideline for analyzing functional life of SMA components...|$|E

40|$|Gas {{turbine engines}} for {{aerospace}} applications have evolved {{dramatically over the}} last 50 years through the constant pursuit for better specific fuel consumption, higher thrust-to-weight ratio, lower noise and emissions all while maintaining reliability and affordability. An important step in enabling these improvements is a forced response aeromechanics analysis involving structural dynamics and aerodynamics of the turbine. It is well documented that forced response vibration is a very critical problem in aircraft engine design, causing High Cycle Fatigue (HCF). Pushing the envelope on engine design has led to increased forced response problems and subsequently {{an increased risk of}} HCF failure. Forced response analysis is used to assess design feasibility of turbine blades for HCF using a material limit boundary set by the <b>Goodman</b> <b>Diagram</b> envelope that combines the effects of steady and vibratory stresses. Forced response analysis is computationally expensive, time consuming and requires multi-domain experts to finalize a result. As a consequence, high-fidelity aeromechanics analysis is performed deterministically and is usually done {{at the end of the}} blade design process when it is very costly to make significant changes to geometry or aerodynamic design. To address uncertainties in the system (engine operating point, temperature distribution, mistuning, etc.) and variability in material properties, designers apply conservative safety factors in the traditional deterministic approach, which leads to bulky designs. Moreover, using a deterministic approach does not provide a calculated risk of HCF failure. This thesis describes a process that begins with the optimal aerodynamic design of a turbomachinery blade developed using surrogate models of high-fidelity analyses. The resulting optimal blade undergoes probabilistic evaluation to generate aeromechanics results that provide a calculated likelihood of failure from HCF. An existing Rolls-Royce High Work Single Stage (HWSS) turbine blisk provides a baseline to demonstrate the process. The generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) toolbox which was developed includes sampling methods and constructs polynomial approximations. The toolbox provides not only the means for uncertainty quantification of the final blade design, but also facilitates construction of the surrogate models used for the blade optimization. This paper shows that gPC, with a small number of samples, achieves very fast rates of convergence and high accuracy in describing probability distributions without loss of detail in the tails. First, an optimization problem maximizes stage efficiency using turbine aerodynamic design rules as constraints; the function evaluations for this optimization are surrogate models from detailed 3 D steady Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analyses. The resulting optimal shape provides a starting point for the 3 D high-fidelity aeromechanics (unsteady CFD and 3 D Finite Element Analysis (FEA)) UQ study assuming three uncertain input parameters. This investigation seeks to find the steady and vibratory stresses associated with the first torsion mode for the HWSS turbine blisk near maximum operating speed of the engine. Using gPC to provide uncertainty estimates of the steady and vibratory stresses enables the creation of a Probabilistic <b>Goodman</b> <b>Diagram,</b> which - to the authors 2 ̆ 7 best knowledge - is the first of its kind using high fidelity aeromechanics for turbomachinery blades. The Probabilistic <b>Goodman</b> <b>Diagram</b> enables turbine blade designers to make more informed design decisions and it allows the aeromechanics expert to assess quantitatively the risk associated with HCF for any mode crossing based on high fidelity simulations. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} use of advanced composite materials on primary aircraft structure has {{brought back to the}} forefront the question of how such structures perform under repeated loading. In particular, when damage or other stress risers are present, tests have shown that the load to cause failure after a given number of cycles is a decreasing function of these cycles. This is a result of damage that was already present in the structure or was created during cyclic loading. In composites, multiple types of damage may be present in the structure at the same time such as matrix cracks, fiber kinks, delaminations, broken fibers, etc. These types of damage may interact and transition from one type to another and are, ultimately, responsible for structural failure. In trying to predict the number of cycles to failure of a composite structure it is, therefore, necessary to understand how damage is created, how it evolves and how different types of damage may interact or coalesce. A first step in that direction, using what is one of the simplest models that can be used, {{is the subject of this}} thesis. The number of cycles to failure is related to the residual strength of the structure for constant amplitude loading. A simple first-order model is postulated that determines the residual strength at any point during the fatigue life as a function of the residual strength at any earlier point in time. For constant amplitude loading, the resulting expression relates the maximum applied load, the number of cycles, the cycles to failure corresponding to the applied load, and the residual strength at the beginning of a test, to the residual strength at the end of the test. With the residual strength known as a function of cycles, a cycle-by-cycle probability of failure is introduced. It is shown that, if the static (or residual) strength follows a two-parameter Weibull distribution, the cycle-by- cycle probability of failure is constant and independent of the number of cycles. For the case of constant cycle-by-cycle probability of failure, the number of cycles to failure is determined as the value that maximizes the likelihood of failure. The resulting expression is in terms of the cycle-by-cycle probability of failure. If the residual strength distribution is known, the cycles to failure can be expressed in terms of parameters of this distribution. Simple closed-form expressions are obtained for two-parameter Weibull distributions. For other types of distributions (normal or lognormal for example) no closed form expressions were found. The effect of R ratio is incorporated using a simple proportional relation that accounts for the load excursion being different from that for R= 0. The predictions of this approach for constant amplitude loading situations were compared to test results in the literature for a wide variety of laminates, materials, and loading conditions. While in some cases the agreement of test results with predictions was excellent, in others the discrepancy clearly suggested that the analytical model must be improved. The analytical model was also used to construct <b>Goodman</b> <b>diagrams</b> and determine omission levels for tests. Comparison of analytically predicted <b>Goodman</b> <b>diagrams</b> to test results showed good agreement in the tension-dominated portion of the diagram but some disagreement in the compression-dominated portion. This is attributed to the simplicity of the model which does not accurately capture interaction of failure modes when both tension and compression loads are present. The omission level is the load level below which no damage is created, no growth of existing damage is observed, and no failure occurs for a prescribed number of cycles. This allows shortening of test programs by eliminating cycles with loads below the omission level. Comparisons of predictions to test results showed very good agreement over a wide variety of tests, materials, R ratios, notches, and layups. The model, in its simplest form, was then extended to spectrum loading cases. This was done by creating an equivalence between different load levels and applied cycles by matching the residual strength at the end of each load level. For this approach to work, the failure mode and damage type dominating the fatigue life must be the same for the two (or more) load segments of interest. This then allows a single quantity, the residual strength, to accurately describe the damage state. Simple closed form expressions were obtained for the number of cycles or load segments to failure under spectrum loading. Comparisons with test results showed good agreement for tension-dominated spectra but major discrepancies for compression-dominated spectra again pointing to the need for improving the model to account for interaction of multiple failure modes and types of damage. The main reason for the discrepancies between test results and analytical predictions was the constant cycle-by-cycle probability of failure that resulted from the original assumptions in the model. If there is one dominant failure mode the cycle-by-cycle probability of failure is constant. However, when more than one types of damage or failure modes are present, their interaction and the resulting load redistribution in the structure changes the cycle-by-cycle probability of failure. The model was, therefore, modified by assuming that the probability of failure is constant over a limited number of cycles until another failure mode or damage type occurs and changes the residual strength and the cycle-by-cycle probability of failure. This can become quite complex even for the apparently simple case of a uni-directional laminate under tension where, during cyclic loading, weak fibers fail and their load is redistributed to adjacent fibers. The main difficulty is then in creating an analytical model that can accurately determine stresses throughout the structure as damage evolves and, on the basis of these stresses, predict the residual strength. The improved model was applied to two cases, a uni-directional laminate and a cross-ply laminate of the form [0 m/ 90 n]s under tension-tension fatigue. For the uni-directional laminate, the improved predictions for cycles to failure were in excellent agreement with test results. For the cross-ply laminate, the accuracy of the predictions ranged from excellent to poor depending on the ratio of the thickness of internal 90 o plies to that of the surrounding 0 o plies. The main issue in this case is that the analytical model developed for predicting stresses around matrix cracks and the associated load redistribution in the laminate are not very accurate as the crack density increases beyond a certain point. More accurate analytical modeling of this situation is expected to improve the predictions for cycles to failure. The analysis method proposed here is still in its infancy. In its simplest form, it is shown to work well in many cases but not well in others. What is important is that a framework for performing fatigue analysis of composites is presented, which relies on the residual strength and how that varies with cycles as damage is created and evolves. Essentially, what is proposed here is a wear-out model. Wear-out models have been proposed before. The main difference and potential improvement here is that there is no need for curve fitting test data or experimentally determined fatigue parameters. The equations governing the model are determined analytically and, in some cases, in closed form. While the model needs further improvements mainly in how the creation of different types of damage is predicted and how their interaction and evolution is accounted for, it is very promising because it provides a general and purely analytical methodology to predict cycles to failure under constant amplitude or spectrum loading.

40|$|Concentric tensile and {{flexural}} tensile {{fatigue tests}} {{were carried out}} on plain concrete specimens. The effects of pulsating tensile loadings {{as well as of}} alternating tensilecompressive loadings were studiep. The results of the constant-amplitude tests have been presented in S-N <b>diagrams</b> and a <b>Goodman</b> <b>diagram.</b> From these results it emerged that fatigue life was strongly reduced by alternation of the stress from tension to compression. Furthermore the number of cycles to failure for wet specimens was lower than for dry ones. It was also found that for equal load signals applied, flexural tests resulted in longer fatigue lifes than concentric tests, probably because of the possibility of redistribution of stresses. The longitudinal strains of the concentric tests were analysed. This resulted in a strong relation between strain rate and fatigue life. The concentric tests were continued with program-loading tests in order to check Miner's rule. Based on strain rate Miner's rule could be verified and Miner's number, M = 1, at failure turned out to be safe in general. Stevin LaboratoryCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{research}} {{was to develop a}} small blade fatigue test system which met the criterion of the IEC (TR 61400 - 23) for the small composite wind turbine blades (SCWTBs). The fatigue test machine consisted of the servo motor, linear guide, transmission, controlling system and clamping apparatuses. These components were used to balance the weights loaded on the blades. Weights were added to change the different mass at each saddle for the loading tests. Amplitude of fatigue can be manipulated by rotating the eccentric holes of the flywheel. The kinetic power of the SCWTBs was translated from the circular motion to linear motion. The fatigue test system was able to test 1 m- 3 m SCWTBs with single or multiple samples tested simultaneously. Because vibration frequency of the fatigue test system was limited to 3 - 6 Hz, this research also tested the repaired samples after breaking them intentionally for the tests. Finally, the paper drew the linear formulation of the <b>Goodman</b> <b>diagram.</b> The experimentally determined S-N curve for R=– 1 was used to define the intercepts of the constant life curves of the vertical axis of the SCWTBs...|$|R

PPP {{was applied to the}} specimens with a semi-circular slit with depths of a = 0. 4, 0. 8, 1. 2, and 1. 6 mm. Then, three-point bending fatigue tests were carried out under R = 0. 05. The fa-tigue limits of low-carbon steel welded specimens containing a semi-circular slit were increased for peened specimens compared with non-peened specimens. Peened specimens having a semi-circular slit with a depth of a = 1. 2 mm had high fatigue limits, almost equal to those of the non-slit peened specimens. It was concluded that a semi-circular slit with a depth of less than a = 1. 2 mm can be rendered harmless by peening. Then, the fatigue improvement by peening was predicted. The fatigue limits before and after peening could be estimated accurately by using a modified <b>Goodman</b> <b>diagram</b> considering {{the effects of}} residual stress, stress concentration, and Vickers hardness.

It is believed that the failure of an insulation retainer holding foam insulation around {{the exterior of the}} fan drive shaft resulted in the subsequent damage to other components in the tunnel. The effect was determined of removing the external thermal insulation on the shaft would have on the stresses on the shaft, disk and bolts holding the two together. To accomplish this, a detailed thermal/structural finite element analysis of the shaft-disk interface was performed. The maximum stresses on the three components were determined for several configurations and conditions with and without the external thermal insulation, and then these results were compared to the original analyses to access the effect of removing the external thermal insulation on the proposed future operation of the shaft/disk structures of the fan drive system. Although the stresses were higher without the external insulation, the stresses did meet all stress criteria. In addition, all stresses were within the infinite life regime of the Modified <b>Goodman</b> <b>diagram.</b> Therefore, it was determined that the structural integrity of the shaft-disk region is not compromised if the external insulation is removed...|$|R
