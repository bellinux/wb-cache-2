2500|$|Steel: Case hardened, {{stress-relieved}} steel preformed shapes {{are available}} {{in a variety of}} sizes and configurations. [...] Balls, balls with <b>flat</b> <b>spots,</b> ovoids (footballs), diagonally cut wire similar to angle-cut cylinders, ball cones and cones (both of which are different from the general concept of cones) and pins are the most commonly used. [...] Steel media weigh approximately 300 pounds per cubic foot and are expensive for initial installation, but, because of their minimal attrition rate and extreme cleanliness, are being more widely used for light deburring applications and cleaning. [...] Compounds are available to keep steel burnishing media clean and bright for extended periods.|$|E
2500|$|The loss of {{friction}} between wheels and rail results in loss of tractive force — the wheels begin to spin, {{and in some}} instances the train is unable to move. In braking, substantial loss {{of friction}} results in reduced braking force. Braking distances are considerably longer, and in extreme cases the wheels may even lock up, causing the train to slide. Modern locomotives and multiple units are equipped with Wheel slide protection to counter slippery rail conditions. [...] Locked wheels can self-grind <b>flat</b> <b>spots</b> on the steel tyres, especially if the wheels are still sliding when arriving at a non-greasy section of rail, e.g. one that has previously been sanded. [...] This causes the wheels to go out of profile (known colloquially as 'wheel flats'), which subsequently leads to severe vibration and the need for the wheels to be re-profiled or re-tyred at great expense.|$|E
2500|$|The bench is a {{glassblower}}'s workstation, {{and has a}} {{place for}} the glassblower to sit, {{a place for the}} handheld tools, and two rails that the pipe or punty rides on while the blower works with the piece. Blocks are ladle-like tools made from water-soaked fruitwood, and are used similarly to the marver to shape and cool a piece in the early steps of creation. [...] In similar fashion, pads of water-soaked newspaper (roughly 6 inches square, one-half to one inch thick), held in the bare hand, can be used to shape the piece. [...] Jacks are tools shaped somewhat like large tweezers with two blades, which are used for forming shape later {{in the creation of a}} piece. Paddles are flat pieces of wood or graphite used for creating <b>flat</b> <b>spots</b> such as a bottom. Tweezers are used to pick out details or to pull on the glass. There are two important types of shears, straight shears and diamond shears. Straight shears are essentially bulky scissors, used for making linear cuts. Diamond shears have blades that form a diamond shape when partially open. These are used for cutting off masses of glass.|$|E
40|$|Circle maps with a <b>flat</b> <b>spot</b> are studied {{which are}} differentiable, {{even on the}} {{boundary}} of the <b>flat</b> <b>spot.</b> Estimates on the Lebesgue measure and the Hausdorff dimension of the non-wandering set are obtained. Also, a sharp transition is found from degenerate geometry similar to what was found earlier for non-differentiable maps with a <b>flat</b> <b>spot</b> to bounded geometry as in critical maps without a <b>flat</b> <b>spot...</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{presence}} of the <b>flat</b> <b>spot</b> is strong indicator for gas occurrence; this <b>flat</b> <b>spot</b> {{may be the result}} of different physical property contrasts of geological and geophysical signatures.

50|$|A flat spot, or wheel flat, is a {{fault in}} {{railroad}} wheel shape. A flat spot {{occurs when a}} rail vehicle's wheelset is dragged along the rail after the wheel/axle has stopped rotating. <b>Flat</b> <b>spots</b> are usually caused by use of the emergency brake, or slip and slide conditions that causes wheels to lock up while the train is still moving. <b>Flat</b> <b>spots</b> are {{more common in the}} autumn and winter when the rails are slippery. <b>Flat</b> <b>spots</b> can also be caused by faulty brakes or wheelset bearings.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{classify}} {{the dynamics}} of (orientation-preserving) <b>flat</b> <b>spot</b> maps on the circle, and derive explicit expressions for the function counting the first entrance time into the <b>flat</b> <b>spot.</b> Metric properties of first entrance time functions for the standard <b>flat</b> <b>spot</b> family are analysed in detail, via a computation of conditional expectation {{with respect to the}} orbit partition. This facilitates investigation of the median of the entrance time function, proving the surprising result that its first entrance time is constrained to equal either 1, 2, 4, 5, or 12, provided the rotation number of the <b>flat</b> <b>spot</b> map does not equal the exceptional values 0, ± 2 / 7, ± 3 / 10, ± 1 / 3, ± 3 / 8...|$|R
50|$|If the <b>flat</b> <b>spot</b> is {{very large}} (as in the picture), strands of molten metal may have got stuck {{on one side}} of the <b>flat</b> <b>spot,</b> making it {{impossible}} for the wheel to turn due to insufficient clearance between the rolling surface and the brake block. In this case, the wheelset must be replaced immediately.|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of other {{possible}} reasons for there being a <b>flat</b> <b>spot</b> on a seismic image. It could be representative of a mineralogical change in the subsurface or an unresolved shallower multiple. Additionally, the interpretation of a <b>flat</b> <b>spot</b> should be attempted after depth conversion to confirm that the anomaly is actually flat.|$|R
50|$|To {{stage the}} disease, various tests may be ordered, to assess nodes, blood and {{internal}} organs, but most patients present with disease apparently {{confined to the}} skin, as patches (<b>flat</b> <b>spots)</b> and plaques (slightly raised or 'wrinkled' spots).|$|E

5000|$|The Okatoma Creek (sometimes {{referred}} to as the Okatoma River) is known for canoeing, picnicking, and camping. The creek offers lots of <b>flat</b> <b>spots,</b> is easy to paddle, and boats can be ported past the whitewater when needed.

About 17,000 festival goers choose to spend their nights here every year. The campsite is hilly in many places and <b>flat</b> <b>spots</b> are taken quickly, however, the manicured putting greens, which are the flattest areas are generally out of bounds to campers.|$|E

50|$|Correction is not {{possible}} if the inverse does not exist—for instance if the transfer function has <b>flat</b> <b>spots</b> (the inverse would map multiple input points to a single output point). This produces an uncorrectable loss of information. Such a situation can occur when an amplifier is overdriven—causing clipping or slew rate distortion when, for a moment, the amplifier characteristics alone and not the input signal determine the output.|$|E
