5|$|Tubular veins {{run through}} the two-layered {{membranous}} wing. Veins {{are connected to the}} haemocoel and in theory allow <b>haemolymph</b> to flow through them. In addition, a nerve and trachea may pass through the veins.|$|E
5|$|Like other insects, {{grasshoppers}} {{have an open}} {{circulatory system}} and their body cavities are filled with <b>haemolymph.</b> A heart-like structure in {{the upper part of}} the abdomen pumps the fluid to the head from where it percolates past the tissues and organs on its way back to the abdomen. This system circulates nutrients throughout the body and carries metabolic wastes to be excreted into the gut. Other functions of the <b>haemolymph</b> include wound healing, heat transfer and the provision of hydrostatic pressure, but the circulatory system is not involved in gaseous exchange. Respiration is performed using tracheae, air-filled tubes, which open at the surfaces of the thorax and abdomen through pairs of valved spiracles. Larger insects may need to actively ventilate their bodies by opening some spiracles while others remain closed, using abdominal muscles to expand and contract the body and pump air through the system.|$|E
5|$|Spiders have {{developed}} several different respiratory anatomies, based on book lungs, a tracheal system, or both. Mygalomorph and Mesothelae spiders have {{two pairs of}} book lungs filled with <b>haemolymph,</b> where openings on the ventral surface of the abdomen allow air to enter and diffuse oxygen. This {{is also the case}} for some basal araneomorph spiders, like the family Hypochilidae, but the remaining members of this group have just the anterior pair of book lungs intact while the posterior pair of breathing organs are partly or fully modified into tracheae, through which oxygen is diffused into the <b>haemolymph</b> or directly to the tissue and organs. The trachea system has most likely evolved in small ancestors to help resist desiccation. The trachea were originally connected to the surroundings through a pair of openings called spiracles, but in the majority of spiders this pair of spiracles has fused into a single one in the middle, and moved backwards close to the spinnerets. Spiders that have tracheae generally have higher metabolic rates and better water conservation. Spiders are ectotherms, so environmental temperatures affect their activity.|$|E
5|$|There are {{estimated}} to be 100,000 species of ichneumonoid wasps in the families Braconidae and Ichneumonidae. These are almost exclusively parasitoids, mostly utilising other insects as hosts. Another family, the Pompilidae, is a specialist parasitoid of spiders. Some wasps are even parasitoids of parasitoids; the eggs of Euceros are laid beside lepidopteran larvae and the wasp larvae feed temporarily on their <b>haemolymph,</b> but if a parasitoid emerges from the host, the hyperparasites continue their life cycle inside the parasitoid. Parasitoids maintain their extreme diversity through narrow specialism. In Peru, 18 wasp species were found living on 14 fly species in only two species of Gurania climbing squash.|$|E
5|$|The {{larval stage}} of dragonflies lasts {{up to five}} years in large species, and between two months and three years in smaller species. When the naiad is ready to {{metamorphose}} into an adult, it stops feeding and makes its way to the surface, generally at night. It remains stationary with its head out of the water, while its respiration system adapts to breathing air, then climbs up a reed or other emergent plant, and moults (ecdysis). Anchoring itself firmly in a vertical position with its claws, its skin begins to split at a weak spot behind the head. The adult dragonfly crawls out of its larval skin, the exuvia, arching backwards when all but the tip of its abdomen is free, to allow its exoskeleton to harden. Curling back upwards, it completes its emergence, swallowing air, which plumps out its body, and pumping <b>haemolymph</b> into its wings, which causes them to expand to their full extent.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} all but {{its last}} moult, the caterpillar spins a cocoon out of silk. The cocoon {{can be in}} the tree crown or between two leaves, but is most often near the ground, between moss and bark. It is an open network cocoon with large and irregular mesh. In the warm season, the cocoon takes about 10 hours to spin, the metamorphosis takes place about 29 hours later and lasts about 6 minutes. These durations are slightly longer in the cold season. The chrysalis stage lasts 17 days in November, the warmest month, and 23 days in July, the coldest month. Five to six days before eclosion, the motifs of the wings start to become visible. The moth emerges during the night or in low light, by splitting the pupal case from the top. Once out of the pupal exuvia (the pupal exoskeleton), the moth finds a horizontal surface, from which it suspends itself by its four anterior legs. The wings are deployed in about 10 minutes, by pumping <b>haemolymph</b> into the wing veins. The moth then beats them a few times, waits 45 minutes to let them harden, then beats them lightly again. The moth finally takes flight between one and a half to two hours later.|$|E
5|$|After hatching, the nymphs {{fall from}} the {{branches}} to seek {{a crack in the}} soil where they can burrow, often to a depth of 10–40cm (4–16in), by digging with their large forelegs. Larger species of cicada like A.curvicosta are thought to spend 2–8 years underground, during which time they grow and feed through their rostrum on the sap from tree roots. They moult five times before emerging from the ground to shed their final shell. Although consistently taking place at night, the emergence of the population is diffusely spread over the season in comparison to the more high-density Australian species. The sex ratio is about 1.15males to every female, consistent throughout the emergence. The metabolic rate over a period of about 6.5hours during emergence of A.curvicosta is about 1.8times the resting metabolic rate of the adult. A South East Queensland study reported nymphs would emerge on most tree species but avoid Norfolk pine (Araucaria heterophylla) and broad-leaved paperbark (Melaleuca quinquenervia). The adults are usually found between November and May but are sometimes observed as early as September and until as late as June. They were recorded as appearing every year, mainly in December and January in western Sydney, with a similar 92-day emergence period from late November until late February recorded in South East Queensland. This makes it one of the last Australian cicadas to emerge each season. The nymph grips onto the tree bark with all of its legs, swallows air and redistributes <b>haemolymph</b> to split the cast down the center of its back. It then extracts its head and clypeus by hunching its body, and when these have emerged, arches back to draw the legs out of their casing. It then slowly unfolds its wings, finally bending forward and gripping onto the front of the shell to free its abdomen. Once free it hangs for hours more as the wings harden.|$|E
25|$|Spiders, {{like most}} arthropods, {{have an open}} circulatory system, i.e., {{they do not have}} true blood, or veins to convey it. Rather, their bodies are filled with <b>haemolymph,</b> which is pumped through arteries by a heart into spaces called sinuses {{surrounding}} their internal organs. The <b>haemolymph</b> contains hemocyanin, a respiratory protein similar in function to hemoglobin. Hemocyanin contains two copper atoms, tinting the <b>haemolymph</b> with a faint blue color.|$|E
25|$|Body fluids enter through one-way valved ostia, {{which are}} {{openings}} situated {{along the length}} of the combined aorta and heart organ. Pumping of the <b>haemolymph</b> occurs by waves of peristaltic contraction, originating at the body's posterior end, pumping forwards into the dorsal vessel, out via the aorta and then into the head where it flows out into the haemocoel. The <b>haemolymph</b> is circulated to the appendages unidirectionally with the aid of muscular pumps or accessory pulsatile organs usually found at the base of the antennae or wings and sometimes in the legs, with pumping rates accelerating with periods of increased activity. Movement of <b>haemolymph</b> is particularly important for thermoregulation in orders such as Odonata, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and Diptera.|$|E
25|$|Insect {{blood or}} haemolymph's main {{function}} {{is that of}} transport and it bathes the insect's body organs. Making up usually less than 25% of an insect's body weight, it transports hormones, nutrients and wastes and has a role in, osmoregulation, temperature control, immunity, storage (water, carbohydrates and fats) and skeletal function. It also plays an essential part in the moulting process. An additional role of the <b>haemolymph</b> in some orders, can be that of predatory defence. It can contain unpalatable and malodourous chemicals that will act {{as a deterrent to}} predators. <b>Haemolymph</b> contains molecules, ions and cells; regulating chemical exchanges between tissues, <b>haemolymph</b> is encased in the insect body cavity or haemocoel. It is transported around the body by combined heart (posterior) and aorta (anterior) pulsations, which are located dorsally just under the surface of the body. It differs from vertebrate blood in that it doesn't contain any red blood cells and therefore is without high oxygen carrying capacity, and is more similar to lymph found in vertebrates.|$|E
25|$|Sclerotisation—after {{emergence}} the new cuticle is {{soft and}} this a particularly vulnerable time for the insect as its hard protective coating is missing. After {{an hour or two}} the exocuticle hardens and darkens. The wings expand by the force of <b>haemolymph</b> into the wing veins.|$|E
25|$|Apolysis—moulting hormones are {{released}} into the <b>haemolymph</b> and the old cuticle separates from the underlying epidermal cells. The epidermis increases in size due to mitosis and then the new cuticle is produced. Enzymes secreted by the epidermal cells digest the old endocuticle, not affecting the old sclerotised exocuticle.|$|E
25|$|Some {{members of}} Paederina (specifically the genus Paederus), a {{subtribe}} of Paederinae, contain a potent vesicant in their <b>haemolymph</b> {{that can produce}} a skin irritation called dermatitis linearis, which in English has acquired the inaccurate name Paederus dermatitis. The irritant pederin is highly toxic, more potent than cobra venom.|$|E
25|$|Ecdysis—this {{begins with}} the {{splitting}} of the old cuticle, usually starting in the midline of the thorax’s dorsal side. The rupturing force is mostly from <b>haemolymph</b> pressure that has been forced into thorax by abdominal muscle contractions caused by the insect swallowing air or water. After this the insect wriggles {{out of the old}} cuticle.|$|E
25|$|Appendicular: {{originating}} {{from either the}} sternum or the tergum and inserted on the coxae these muscles move appendages as one unit. These are arranged segmentally and usually in antagonistic pairs. Appendage parts of some insects, e.g. the galea and the lacinia of the maxillae, only have flexor muscles. Extension of these structures is by <b>haemolymph</b> pressure and cuticle elasticity.|$|E
25|$|H. axyridis secretes {{a number}} of {{defensive}} compounds, one of which, (9Z,17R)-9-Octadecene-1,17-diamine (harmonine) has been isolated from its <b>haemolymph.</b> This molecule {{has been reported to}} have broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity that includes human pathogens. Antibacterial activity is most pronounced against fast-growing mycobacteria and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and the growth of both chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum strains is also inhibited.|$|E
25|$|Spiders have {{developed}} several different respiratory anatomies, based either on book lungs or on tracheae. Mesothele and mygalomorph spiders have {{two pairs of}} book lungs filled with <b>haemolymph,</b> where openings on the ventral surface of the abdomen allow air to enter and oxygen to diffuse in and carbon dioxide to diffuse out. This {{is also the case}} for some basal araneomorph spiders like the family Hypochilidae, but the remaining members of this group have just the anterior pair of book lungs intact while the posterior pair of breathing organs are partly or fully modified into tracheae, through which oxygen is diffused into the <b>haemolymph</b> or directly to the tissue and organs. This system has most likely evolved in small ancestors to help resist desiccation. The trachea were originally connected to the surroundings through a pair of spiracles, but in the majority of spiders this pair of spiracles has fused into a single one in the middle, and migrated posterior close to the spinnerets.|$|E
25|$|Hormones are the {{chemical}} substances that are transported in the insect’s body fluids (<b>haemolymph)</b> that carry messages {{away from their}} point of synthesis to sites where physiological processes are influenced. These hormones are produced by glandular, neuroglandular and neuronal centres. Insects have several organs that produce hormones, controlling reproduction, metamorphosis and moulting. It has been suggested that a brain hormone is responsible for caste dermination in termites and diapause interruption in some insects.|$|E
25|$|The {{heart is}} located in the abdomen a short {{distance}} within the middle line of the dorsal body-wall, and above the intestine. Unlike in insects, the heart is not divided into chambers, but consists of a simple tube. The aorta, which supplies <b>haemolymph</b> to the cephalothorax, extends from the anterior end of the heart. Smaller arteries extend from sides and posterior end of the heart. A thin-walled sac, known as the pericardium, completely surrounds the heart.|$|E
25|$|The thorax and abdomen {{are usually}} quite {{distinct}} and bear {{different kinds of}} legs; they are typically laterally compressed, {{and there is no}} carapace. The thorax bears eight pairs of uniramous appendages, the first of which are used as accessory mouthparts; the next four pairs are directed forwards, and the last three pairs are directed backwards. Gills are present on the thoracic segments, and there is an open circulatory system with a heart, using haemocyanin to carry oxygen in the <b>haemolymph</b> to the tissues. The uptake and excretion of salts is controlled by special glands on the antennae.|$|E
25|$|All bed bugs mate by {{traumatic}} insemination. Female bed bugs {{possess a}} reproductive tract that functions during oviposition, but the male {{does not use}} this tract for sperm insemination. Instead, the male pierces the female's abdomen with his hypodermic penis and ejaculates into the body cavity. In all bed bug species except Primicimex cavernis, sperm are injected into the mesospermalege, {{a component of the}} spermalege, a secondary genital structure that reduces the wounding and immunological costs of traumatic insemination. Injected sperm travel via the <b>haemolymph</b> (blood) to sperm storage structures called seminal conceptacles, with fertilisation eventually taking place at the ovaries.|$|E
25|$|Both {{female and}} male ticks quest for a host, but for {{different}} reasons. The female quests for a blood meal, the male to search the host for a female tick in order to mate and feed from her. Males may parasitise the female ticks by piercing their cuticle with their mouth parts to feed on the <b>haemolymph</b> (up to 3-4 males have been found feeding on one female tick). Adult male ticks rarely blood-feed on a host. The outside surface, or cuticle, of hard ticks actually grows to accommodate the large volume of blood ingested, which, in adult ticks, may be anywhere from 200 to 600 times their unfed body weight. When a tick is fully engorged {{it is said to}} be replete.|$|E
25|$|Within the {{mosquito}} midgut, the female gamete maturation process entails slight morphological changes, becoming more enlarged and spherical. The male gametocyte undergoes a rapid nuclear division within 15 minutes, producing eight flagellated microgametes {{by a process}} called exflagellation. The flagellated microgamete fertilizes the female macrogamete to produce a diploid cell called a zygote. The zygote then develops into an ookinete. The ookinete is a motile cell, capable of invading other organs of {{the mosquito}}. It traverses the peritrophic membrane of the mosquito midgut and crosses the midgut epithelium. Once through the epithelium, the ookinete enters the basal lamina, and settles to an immotile oocyst. For several days, the oocyst undergoes 10 to 11 rounds of cell division to create a syncytial cell (sporoblast) containing thousands of nuclei. Meiosis takes place inside the sporoblast to produce over 3,000 haploid daughter cells called sporozoites {{on the surface of}} the mother cell. Immature sporozoites break through the oocyst wall into the <b>haemolymph.</b> They migrate to the mosquito salivary glands where they undergo further development and become infective to humans.|$|E
500|$|Arthropods {{and most}} mollusks {{have an open}} circulatory system. In this system, deoxygenated blood {{collects}} around the heart in cavities (...) [...] This blood slowly permeates the heart through many small one-way channels. The heart then pumps the blood into the hemocoel, a cavity between the organs. The heart in arthropods is typically a muscular tube that runs {{the length of the}} body, under the back and {{from the base of the}} head. Instead of blood the circulatory fluid is <b>haemolymph</b> which carries the most commonly used respiratory pigment, copper-based haemocyanin as the oxygen transporter; iron-based haemoglobin is used by only a few arthropods.|$|E
500|$|Like other insects, ants have an exoskeleton, an {{external}} covering {{that provides a}} protective casing around the body and a point of attachment for muscles, {{in contrast to the}} internal skeletons of humans and other vertebrates. Insects do not have lungs; oxygen and other gases, such as carbon dioxide, pass through their exoskeleton via tiny valves called spiracles. Insects also lack closed blood vessels; instead, they have a long, thin, perforated tube {{along the top of the}} body (called the [...] "dorsal aorta") that functions like a heart, and pumps <b>haemolymph</b> toward the head, thus driving the circulation of the internal fluids. The nervous system consists of a ventral nerve cord that runs the length of the body, with several ganglia and branches along the way reaching into the extremities of the appendages.|$|E
500|$|The thorax {{consists}} of three segments as in all insects. The prothorax is small and is flattened dorsally into a shield-like disc which has two transverse ridges. The mesothorax and metathorax are fused into a rigid, box-like structure with internal bracing, and provides a robust attachment for the powerful wing muscles inside it. The thorax bears two pairs of wings and three pairs of legs. The wings are long, veined, and membranous, narrower at the tip and wider at the base. The hindwings are broader than the forewings and the venation is different at the base. The veins carry <b>haemolymph,</b> which is analogous to blood in vertebrates and carries out many similar functions, but which also serves a hydraulic function to expand the body between nymphal stages (instars) and to expand and stiffen the wings after the adult emerges from the final nymphal stage. The leading edge of each wing has a node where other veins join the marginal vein, and the wing is able to flex at this point. In most large species of dragonflies, the wings of females are shorter and broader than those of males. The legs are rarely used for walking, but are used to catch and hold prey, for perching, and for climbing on plants. Each has two short basal joints, two long joints, and a three-jointed foot, armed {{with a pair of}} claws. The long leg joints bear rows of spines, and in males, one row of spines on each front leg is modified to form an [...] "eyebrush", for cleaning the surface of the compound eye.|$|E
2500|$|In the American lobster, {{endogenous}} morphine {{is found}} in the <b>haemolymph</b> and ventral nerve cord. [...] In lobsters which have had a pereiopod (walking leg) cut off or been injected with the irritant lipopolysaccharide, the endogenous morphine levels initially increased by 24% for <b>haemolymph</b> and 48% for the nerve cord.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{species of}} blood-sucking flies, such {{as many of}} the Ceratopogonidae, will attack large, live insects and suck their <b>haemolymph</b> and others, such as the {{so-called}} [...] "jackal flies" [...] (Milichiidae), will attack the recently dead prey of say, crab spiders (Thomisidae), but in the late 1960s it was reported that some species of anautogenous mosquitoes would feed on the <b>haemolymph</b> of caterpillars. Other observations include mosquitoes feeding on cicadas, and mantids. More recently {{it has been shown that}} malaria-transmitting mosquitoes will actively seek out some species of caterpillars and feed on their <b>haemolymph,</b> and do so to the caterpillar's apparent physical detriment.|$|E
2500|$|In arthropods, {{the open}} circulatory {{system is a}} system in which a fluid in a cavity called the hemocoel bathes the organs {{directly}} with oxygen and nutrients and there is no distinction between blood and interstitial fluid; this combined fluid is called hemolymph or <b>haemolymph.</b> [...] Muscular movements by the animal during locomotion can facilitate hemolymph movement, but diverting flow from one area to another is limited. When the heart relaxes, blood is drawn back toward the heart through open-ended pores (ostia).|$|E
2500|$|After {{the fifth}} moult the insect {{is said to}} have fledged but it is not yet mature. It is at first soft and pink with {{drooping}} wings, but {{over the course of a}} few days, the cuticle hardens and [...] <b>haemolymph</b> is pumped into the wings which stiffen them. Maturation can occur in two to four weeks when the food supply and weather conditions are suitable, but may take as long as six months when they are less ideal. Males start maturing first and give off an odour which stimulates maturation in the females. On maturing the insects turn yellow and the abdomens of the females start swelling with developing eggs.|$|E
2500|$|In {{invertebrates}} {{the open}} respiratory system {{is made up}} of spiracles, tracheae, and tracheoles that terrestrial arthropods have to transport metabolic gases to and from tissues. [...] The distribution of spiracles can vary greatly among the many orders of insects, but in general each segment of the body can have only one pair of spiracles, each of which connects to an atrium and has a relatively large tracheal tube behind it. The tracheae are invaginations of the cuticular exoskeleton that branch (anastomose) throughout the body with diameters from only a few micrometres up to 0.8mm. The smallest tubes, tracheoles, penetrate cells and serve as sites of diffusion for water, oxygen, and carbon dioxide. Gas may be conducted through the respiratory system by [...] means of active ventilation or passive diffusion. Unlike vertebrates, insects do not generally carry oxygen in their <b>haemolymph.</b>|$|E
2500|$|... 3. Proctodeum (hindgut): This {{is divided}} into three sections; the {{anterior}} is the ileum, the middle portion, the colon, and the wider, posterior section is the rectum. This extends from the pyloric valve which is located between the mid and the hindgut to the anus. Here absorption of water, salts and other beneficial substances take place before excretion. Like other animals, the removal of toxic metabolic waste requires water. However, for very small animals like insects, water conservation is a priority. Because of this, blind-ended ducts called Malpighian tubules come into play. These ducts emerge as evaginations at the anterior end of the hindgut and are the main organs of osmoregulation and excretion. These extract the waste products from the <b>haemolymph,</b> in which all the internal organs are bathed). These tubules continually produce the insect’s uric acid, which is transported to the hindgut, where important salts and water are re-absorbed by both the hindgut and rectum. Excrement is then voided as insoluble and non-toxic uric acid granules. Excretion and osmoregulation in insects are not orchestrated by the Malpighian tubules alone, but require a joint function of the ileum and/or rectum.|$|E
2500|$|Plant viruses {{need to be}} {{transmitted}} by a vector, most often insects such as leafhoppers. One class of viruses, the Rhabdoviridae, has been proposed to actually be insect viruses that have evolved to replicate in plants. The chosen insect vector of a plant virus will often be the determining factor in that virus's host range: it can only infect plants that the insect vector feeds upon. This was shown in part when the old world white fly {{made it to the}} United States, where it transferred many plant viruses into new hosts. Depending on the way they are transmitted, plant viruses are classified as non-persistent, semi-persistent and persistent. In non-persistent transmission, viruses become attached to the distal tip of the stylet of the insect and on the next plant it feeds on, it inoculates it with the virus. Semi-persistent viral transmission involves the virus entering the foregut of the insect. Those viruses that manage to pass through the gut into the <b>haemolymph</b> and then to the salivary glands are known as persistent. There are two sub-classes of persistent viruses: propagative and circulative. Propagative viruses are able to replicate in both the plant and the insect (and may have originally been insect viruses), whereas circulative can not. Circulative viruses are protected inside aphids by the chaperone protein symbionin, produced by bacterial symbionts. [...] Many plant viruses encode within their genome polypeptides with domains essential for transmission by insects. In non-persistent and semi-persistent viruses, these domains are in the coat protein and another protein known as the helper component. A bridging hypothesis has been proposed to explain how these proteins aid in insect-mediated viral transmission. The helper component will bind to the specific domain of the coat protein, and then the insect mouthparts — creating a bridge. In persistent propagative viruses, such as tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), there is often a lipid coat surrounding the proteins that is not seen in other classes of plant viruses. In the case of TSWV, 2 viral proteins are expressed in this lipid envelope. It has been proposed that the viruses bind via these proteins and are then taken into the insect cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of gastropods have <b>haemolymph</b> containing the respiratory pigment haemocyanin. This is a copper-containing protein {{that helps to}} carry oxygen, and gives the <b>haemolymph</b> a pale blue colour. In the freshwater Planorbid snails, however, the haemocyanin is replaced by haemoglobin, and thus their <b>haemolymph</b> is red rather than blue. Some gastropods, such as the sea hare Aplysia, appear to lack respiratory pigments altogether.|$|E
50|$|As {{in other}} molluscs, the circulatory system of {{gastropods}} is open, with the fluid, or <b>haemolymph,</b> flowing through sinuses and bathing the tissues directly. The <b>haemolymph</b> typically contains haemocyanin, and is blue in colour.|$|E
