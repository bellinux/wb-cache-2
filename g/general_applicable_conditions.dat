40|$|We have {{completed}} computer simulations that model shock {{effects in the}} venusian atmosphere caused during the passage of two cometlike bodies 100 m and 1000 m in diameter and an asteroidlike body 10 km in diameter. Our objective is to examine hypervelocity-generated shock effects in the venusian atmosphere for bodies of different types and sizes {{in order to understand}} the following: (1) their deceleration and depth of penetration through the atmosphere; and (2) the onset of possible ground-surface shock effects such as splotches, craters, and ejecta formations. The three bodies were chosen to include both a range of <b>general</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>applicable</b> to Venus as well as three specific cases of current interest. These calculations use a new multiphase computer code (DICE-MAZ) designed by California Research & Technology for shock-dynamics simulations in complex environments. The code was tested and calibrated in large-scale explosion, cratering, and ejecta research. It treats a wide range of different multiphase conditions, including material types (vapor, melt, solid), particle-size distributions, and shock-induced dynamic changes in velocities, pressures, temperatures (internal energies), densities, and other related parameters, all of which were recorded in our calculations...|$|R

(Note that an instantiated “model fragment” is distinguished from “model fragment class” which describes a principle/law itself.) A model-making process (i.e., solution) is described as the procedure in which model fragments are applied (instantiated) in turn to the situations (represented with MACs and BCCs) to yield new consequences (represented with PPCs).

50|$|A hospital's {{readmission}} rate {{is calculated}} and then risk adjusted. A ratio of predicted or measured readmissions compared to expected readmissions (based on similar hospitals) is calculated, called the excess readmission ratio. This is {{calculated for each}} of the <b>applicable</b> <b>conditions.</b> This ratio is then used to calculate the estimated payments made by CMS to the hospital for excess readmissions as a ratio of the payments by CMS for all discharges. This creates a readmissions adjustment factor, which is then used to calculate a financial penalty to the hospital for excess readmissions. To reach these calculations, up to three previous years of a hospital's data and a minimum of 25 cases for each <b>applicable</b> <b>condition</b> are used.|$|R

Bifurcation functions H:Rd− 1 ×R×R→Rd are obtained, where d is the dimension of {{the intersection of the}} stable and unstable manifolds. The zeros of H correspond to the existence of the homoclinic orbit for the perturbed systems. Some <b>applicable</b> <b>conditions</b> are given to ensure that the functions are solvable. Moreover the homoclinic solution for the perturbed system is transversal under the <b>applicable</b> <b>conditions</b> and hence the perturbed system exhibits chaos.
