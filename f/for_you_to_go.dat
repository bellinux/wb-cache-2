500|$|GameSpot's Mc Shea found Second Sons open world {{beholden to}} a dated formula. He {{described}} Seattle as [...] "a playground <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> nuts in" [...] instead of [...] "a living, breathing world", with the Seattleites existing only as fodder for players. CVGs Hussain called Seattle [...] "hauntingly empty", with the sparsely distributed NPCs behaving inanimately. He {{felt that the}} open world's lifelessness was the game's biggest detractor, and he drew unfavorable comparison with Grand Theft Auto V, Sleeping Dogs and , which he felt featured better open worlds. Eurogamer's Welsh felt that Second Son did not innovate the open world genre {{as well as it}} could have because it relied too heavily on many of the genre's tropes. Polygon's Kollar felt that there was not enough variation in the missions and activities, as [...] "virtually all culminate in the goal of beating up more soldiers or thugs". Edge found the amount of content in the game thin, finding little merit in additional playthroughs because of the repetitive side-missions. [...] "Approach [...] as an action game that just happens to be set in a nonlinear environment and it makes more sense", they wrote. Destructoid's Carter found the amount of content ample, and enjoyed liberating the city and collecting Blast Shards.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his closing}} remarks, Reagan asked viewers: [...] "Are you better off now {{than you were}} four years ago? Is it easier <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago? Is there more or less {{unemployment}} in the country than there was four years ago? Is America as respected throughout {{the world as it}} was? Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we're as strong as we were four years ago? And if you answer all of those questions 'yes', why then, I think your choice is very obvious as to whom you will vote for. If you don't agree, if you don't think that this course that we've been on {{for the last four years}} is what you would like to see us follow for the next four, then I could suggest another choice that you have." ...|$|E
2500|$|The shuttle astronauts went {{to sleep}} as planned but were awakened {{by the sound of}} a master alarm on board Atlantis at 22:07 GMT. The tone {{signaled}} a failure with one of Atlantis's five IBM AP-101 General Purpose Computers (GPCs) No. 4. The alarm prompted Commander Ferguson to head to Atlantis and evaluate the issue. GPC-4 was running system management software at the time of failure. Ferguson with the help of Ground Control later transferred the failed GPC's programs onto GPC-2. The transfer took about 45 minutes, bypassing an expected period of loss of signal by utilizing communications at White Sands, New Mexico. After activating GPC-2 and with Atlantis in good shape, Ferguson and other crew members went back to sleep. [...] "You all have done an absolutely fabulous job. We have polled the room, everyone is ready <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to sleep," [...] radioed CAPCOM Shannon Lucid from Mission Control.|$|E
