With this protocol each node estimates temperature change of its neighbors and routes packets around the hot spot area by a withdraw strategy.

These factors make the thermal insulation of the room strongly uneven. When heating the room, {{the location of the}} heat source largely affects room temperature distribution as well. This kind of distribution will be emphasized using an air-conditioner. Room air temperature using heating equipment such as this has both a <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>area</b> due to the air jet discharged from the outlet and several low temperature areas due to drafts from the window.
