Illumination with {{photosynthetically active radiation}} caused a fast turgor loss and wilting in the middle segments of the <b>epicotyls</b> accompanied by accumulation {{of water in the}} intercellular cavities. During this process, room temperature fluorescence emission spectra showed gradual bleaching of porphyrin-type pigments, which was lessened by incubating the <b>epicotyls</b> with excess ascorbate before illumination.

40|$|Kinetin and CaCl 2, in the {{presence}} of indoleacetic acid, promoted lateral expansion of <b>epicotyls</b> of decapitated and derooted Alaska pea seedlings (Pisum sativum L.) and inhibited their elongation. This growth response was correlated with the development of cell walls unusually rich in pectic uronic acids. <b>Epicotyls</b> in calcium-auxin solutions continued to enlarge and to add new wall material long after tissues in auxin only had stopped. Longitudinal enlargement, associated with the development of walls poor in pectic uronic acids, was favored by KCl, MgCl 2, and ethylenediaminetetraacetate. The last of these agents promoted the loss of 45 Ca from the <b>epicotyls.</b> Seedings grown in vermiculite moistened with CaCl 2, KCl, or MgCl 2 solutions did not differ in appearance or in the composition of their walls.

40|$|Pea <b>epicotyls</b> (Pisum sativum, cv. Alaska) were {{enclosed}} in chambers {{in which their}} elongation was restricted {{by means of a}} foam neoprene stopper or by a medium of glass beads. These treatments increased evolution of ethylene and resulted in reduced length and increased diameter of both the internodes and the cells of the internodes. These responses increased with increasing degrees of restriction. A time-sequence study of the emergence of <b>epicotyls</b> through 90 mm of glass beads showed that an accelerated evolution of ethylene preceded a reduction in elongation. As the <b>epicotyls</b> elongated through the glass bead medium and less resistance was encountered, evolution of ethylene declined and rapid elongation was resumed. The morphological and anatomical effects of a 120 -mm column of glass beads were duplicated by applied ethylene concentrations of 0. 2 ppm or less. Evolution of CO 2 was inhibited slightly by the ethylene treatments. The data indicate that production of ethylene by pea <b>epicotyls</b> is increased by nonwounding physical stress, and that the ethylene acts as an endogenous growth regulator, decreasing elongation and increasing diameter in response to increasing increments of stress...|$|R

40|$|Isoflavones are {{compounds}} {{with benefits}} {{for human health}} {{and they are the}} mainly forms of glycosides in vegetables. ?-glucosidase (?-D-glucoside glucohydrolase, E. C. 3. 2. 1. 21) hydrolyses ?-D-glucosides releasing glucose and forming aglycone isoflavones. The aglycone isoflavone is the most bioavailable form of the glycosides. ?-glucosidase that converts glycosidics isoflavones into aglycones can be originated from the metabolism of either fungi or bacteria, and other different processing methodologies. The aim of this work was to investigate the ?-glucosidase activity in soybeans <b>Epicotyls</b> during 168 h of germination to obtain an alternative source of enzyme for purification and application. Seeds of soybean the cultivar BRS 257 were germinated following the standard method, by utilizing two germination chambers (one with photoperiod of 10 h of light and the other without light) at the temperature of 35 ºC and relative humidity of 100 % for different periods of time (72, 96, 120, 144 and 168 h). The <b>epicotyls</b> start to appear at 72 h, they were separated for each experimental time and were freeze-dried. ?-glucosidase from the <b>epicotyls</b> was extracted with citrate buffer containing NaCl (0, 1 M, pH 4, 5). Soluble protein content was determined as described by LOWRY, et. al., and expressed as gram per 100 g of sample in dry basis (%). ?-glucosidase activity was determined using p-nitrophenyl-b-D-glucopiranoside as substrate, as described by Matsuura and Obata and expressed as units of activity per gram of sample in dry basis (UA. g- 1). ?-glucosidase specific activity was the ratio between ?-glucosidase activity and soluble protein content and it was expressed as UA per gram of soluble protein (UA. g- 1 SP). In the cotyledons of soybean seeds before germination, the protein content was 15. 36 %, the ?-glucosidase activity was 146. 64 UA. g- 1 and the specific activity was 0. 97 UA. g- 1 SP. In the seeds germinated under light conditions, the ?-glucosidase activity of the <b>epicotyls</b> increased from 72 h of growth to presented the maximum activity at 144 h (3. 84 x 103 UA. g- 1); at 168 h, the ?-glucosidase activity started to decline. In samples that were germinated without light, the ?-glucosidase activity increased from 72 h to reach its maximum activity at 96 h (3. 14 x 103 UA. g- 1), and declined at 120 and 144 h. It was observed that activitity increased again at 168 h (2. 72 x 103 UA. g- 1 with no significant difference when compared to 96 h). The specific activity was higher at 144 h of light germination (8. 69 UA. g- 1 SP), almost 9 times higher than the cotyledons ?-glucosidase specific activity. During the development of plant, the photosynthesis can give some energetic advantages for development of <b>epicotyls</b> into first leaves of plants rich in nitrogen. This advantage confers accelerated growth allowing the plant to become self-sufficient quickly and be able to respond to environmental conditions. In plants, ?-glucosidase activity involves, among several processes, the mechanisms of defense against microbes, insects and parasitic plants. ?-glucosidase activity of <b>epicotyls</b> germinated under light was 26 times higher at 144 h than cotyledons without germination and 1. 22 times higher than those germinated without light for 96 h, showing that <b>epicotyls</b> from soybean germinated with light over 144 h would be a good source of ?-glucosidase. 201...|$|R
