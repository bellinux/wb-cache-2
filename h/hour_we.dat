500|$|A Ladies' Aid {{society was}} {{established}} on July15, 1903, with board members Marie Hovgaard, Anna P.C. Petersen, Henrietta Hansen, and Sine C. Jensen. At first, Sunday school was conducted an hour {{prior to the}} church services on Sunday, but in 1907 {{it was decided to}} hold Sunday school during the time of worship service. As early as 1904, the synod had discussed the possibility of establishing a children's home at Tyler. On November1, 1906, a children's home opened in the residence of K.H. Duus, who temporarily moved to Askov, Minnesota. A Folk School Association was organized in 1912. As early as 1888, the colony organized its first Danish elementary school for its children, Børneskolen, which was in use until 1939. In her travel diary entitled My Big Adventure of 1915–1916: The joys and hazards of motor touring in 1915, Danebod local Ragna C. Olson (1905–2007) described the average school day in 1914: [...] "We had an hour of religion, then learned how to read and write Danish, some history, and the last <b>hour</b> <b>we</b> girls learned work such as knitting, crocheting and embroidery. In the afternoons, they taught us English, writing, reading and arithmetic." [...] Ragna Olsen (previously Sorensen) was the daughter of the Danish pioneers Johanne Marie Sorensen (1877–1947) and Carl Cold Sorensen (1879–1967), both of whom hold a place in Danebod history for bringing the first motorized vehicles to Tyler in the early 1900s.|$|E

For their [...] "The 20 Best Albums of the 2010s (So Far)" [...] {{published}} in January 2015, the magazine listed the album at number 14, commenting [...] "Timberlake came {{back as a}} lovesick adult, bouncing old-school soul ideas off of his best bud Timbaland and writing a modern-day symphony for his beloved, Jessica Biel, that stretched for over an <b>hour.</b> <b>We</b> all grow up, but few do so as stylishly as JT." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{late summer}} 1916, as Brătianu's {{government}} sealed {{an alliance with}} the Entente, Iorga expressed his joy in a piece named Ceasul ("The Hour"): [...] "the <b>hour</b> <b>we</b> have been expecting for over two centuries, for which we have been living our entire national life, for which {{we have been working}} and writing, fighting and thinking, has at long last arrived." [...] Nevertheless, the Romanian campaign ended in massive defeat, forcing the Romanian Army and the entire administration to evacuate the southern areas, Bucharest included, in front of a German-led occupation. Iorga's home in Vălenii de Munte was among the property items left behind and seized by the occupiers, and, according to Iorga's own claim, was vandalized by the Deutsches Heer.|$|E
2500|$|On September 18, {{the funeral}} of the three other girls killed in the bombing {{was held at the}} Sixth Avenue Baptist Church. Although no city {{officials}} attended this service, present at the girls' funerals were an estimated 800 clergymen of all races. Also present was Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. In a speech conducted before the burial of the girls, Dr. King addressed an estimated 3,300 mourners—including numerous white people—with a speech which included: [...] "This tragic day may cause the white side {{to come to terms with}} its conscience. In spite of the darkness of this <b>hour,</b> <b>we</b> must not become bitter ... We must not lose faith in our white brothers. Life is hard. At times as hard as crucible steel, but, today, you do not walk alone." ...|$|E

As we spun along, out of nowhere this skinny blond kid was on our back wheel. He looked about 14. He was still there 15 minutes later, so we picked up speed. He just sat there, so we picked up the pace again. It was still no problem for him. I looked over my shoulder {{and he gave me}} a half-mocking, half-friendly grin. In the end, we went as hard as we could to try {{to get rid of him}} and teach the little brat a lesson, because by now he was getting a bit too cocky for our tastes. But whatever we did, he still hung on. After about an <b>hour,</b> <b>we</b> came into a village called Ploegsteert, at which point he came alongside with real arrogance and said 'OK, I'm back home now, so 'bye. By the way, I'm Frank Vandenbroucke.' Neither of us had ever met a kid like him." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Robert Craft, Stravinsky {{remained}} a confirmed monarchist {{throughout his life}} and loathed the Bolsheviks from the very beginning. In 1930, he remarked, [...] "I don't believe that anyone venerates Mussolini more than I ... I know many exalted personages, and my artist's mind does not shrink from political and social issues. Well, after having seen so many events and so many more or less representative men, I have an overpowering urge to render homage to your Duce. He is the saviour of Italy and – let us hope – Europe". Later, after a private audience with Mussolini, he added, [...] "Unless my ears deceive me, the voice of Rome {{is the voice of}} Il Duce. I told him that I felt like a fascist myself... In spite of being extremely busy, Mussolini did me the great honour of conversing with me for three-quarters of an <b>hour.</b> <b>We</b> talked about music, art and politics". When the Nazis placed Stravinsky's works on the list of [...] "Entartete Musik", he lodged a formal appeal to establish his Russian genealogy and declared, [...] "I loathe all communism, Marxism, the execrable Soviet monster, and also all liberalism, democratism, atheism, etc." [...] Towards the end of his life, at Craft's behest, Stravinsky made a return visit to his native country and composed a cantata in Hebrew, travelling to Israel for its performance.|$|E
