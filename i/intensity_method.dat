Several researchers have had difficulties implementing this method because of instrumentation phase mis-match. A simple technique for measuring and correcting instrumentation phase mis-match has been developed.

40|$|In DNW a Pressure Sensitive Paint System (PSP) is in use {{at several}} wind tunnels which was {{originally}} developed by DLR {{and based on}} the <b>intensity</b> <b>method.</b> The <b>intensity</b> <b>method</b> has some drawbacks when operated in an industrial wind tunnel. Due to the necessity of image collection for wind off and wind on constellation the tunnel occupation time is nearly doubled. Although the lifetime-based PSP measurement has several advantages compared to the intensity-based method, it is still not a commonly-used PSP technique in wind tunnel testing. One problem is a non-uniform distribution of the measured lifetime over the coated surface. Theoretically PSP lifetime should be independent of the excitation light distribution, dye concentration and paint thickness; however, the measured lifetimes over the coated PSP surface are sometimes not uniform. As a first step, PtTFPP-based PSP for the lifetime-based method has been developed by DLR to improve this lifetime uniformity. In addition special attention was paid to the effect of basecoat material and polymer. The lifetime-based PSP method was applied to a transonic wind tunnel test. As a result, quantitative pressure distributions can be obtained by the lifetime-based method at M = 0. 5 and 0. 3. The PSP results show characteristic pressure distributions on a delta wing model which are compared to the results with the <b>intensity</b> <b>method</b> and numerical data...|$|E

40|$|U-Pb dating of zircons by laser {{ablation}} {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) is a widely used analytical technique in Earth Sciences. For U-Pb ages below 1 billion years (1 Ga), Pb- 206 /U- 238 dates are usually used, showing the least bias by external parameters such {{as the presence of}} initial lead and its isotopic composition in the analysed mineral. Precision and accuracy of the Pb/U ratio are thus of highest importance in LA-ICPMS geochronology. We consider the evaluation of the statistical distribution of the sweep intensities based on goodness-of-fit tests in order to find a model probability distribution fitting the data to apply an appropriate formulation for the standard deviation. We then discuss three main methods to calculate the Pb/U intensity ratio and its uncertainty in the LA-ICPMS: (1) ratio-of-the-mean <b>intensities</b> <b>method,</b> (2) mean-of-the-intensity-ratios method and (3) intercept method. These methods apply different functions to the same raw intensity vs. time data to calculate the mean Pb/U intensity ratio. Thus, the calculated intensity ratio and its uncertainty depend on the method applied. We demonstrate that the accuracy and, conditionally, the precision of the ratio-of-the-mean <b>intensities</b> <b>method</b> are invariant to the intensity fluctuations and averaging related to the dwell time selection and off-line data transformation (averaging of several sweeps); we present a statistical approach how to calculate the uncertainty of this method for transient signals. We also show that the accuracy of methods (2) and (3) is influenced by the intensity fluctuations and averaging, and the extent of this influence can amount to tens of percentage points; we show that the uncertainty of these methods also depends on how the signal is averaged. Each of the above methods imposes requirements to the instrumentation. The ratio-of-the-mean <b>intensities</b> <b>method</b> is sufficiently accurate provided the laser induced fractionation between {{the beginning and the end}} of the signal is kept low and linear. We show, based on a comprehensive series of analyses with different ablation pit sizes, energy densities and repetition rates for a 193 nm ns-ablation system that such a fractionation behaviour requires using a low ablation speed (low energy density and low repetition rate). Overall, we conclude that the ratio-of-the-mean <b>intensities</b> <b>method</b> combined with low sampling rates is the most mathematically accurate among the existing data treatment methods for U-Pb zircon dating by sensitive sector field ICPMS...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} techniques in the field of reliability is reliability-prediction methods based on component constant-failure-rate data for the estimation of system failure rates. This paper investigates a new reliability-estimation method that does not depend upon constant failure rates. Many boards were selected from the Loughborough University field-reliability database, and their reliability was estimated using failure-intensity based methods and then compared with the actual failure intensity observed in the field. The predicted failure-intensity closely agrees with the observed value for the majority of a system operating lifetimes. The general failure <b>intensity</b> <b>method</b> lends itself very easily to system-reliability prediction. It appears to give an estimate of the system-reliability throughout the operating lifetime of the equipment and does not make assumptions, such as constant failure rate, which can be detrimental to the validity of the estimate. The predictions seem, on present evidence, to track the observed behavior well, given the uncertainties that are evident in the field. The failure <b>intensity</b> <b>method</b> should be investigated further to see if it is feasible to estimate the system reliability throughout its lifetime and hence provide a more realistic picture {{of the way in which}} electronic systems behave in the field...|$|E
