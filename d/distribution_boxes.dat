A typical septic system contains a septic tank, <b>distribution</b> <b>box,</b> and absorption field (Figure 1). All components must be functioning properly to effectively remove contaminants from the wastewater and disperse it into the soil.

50|$|The mine {{fields were}} {{composed}} of both contact mines, similar to conventional naval mines exploded by {{contact with a}} vessel, and controlled mines such as the M4 Ground Mine with a 3,000 pound TNT charge. Those mines were planted in planned groups at predetermined locations, connected to shore by electrical cables for firing when a target was observed within their effective range. The mines could be fired individually or as a group. The Distribution Box Boats were specially equipped to maintain the <b>distribution</b> <b>boxes</b> that joined the individual mines within a mine group to the main cable connecting the group to the mine casemate.|$|E
50|$|To prevent this, cable {{providers}} built stronger {{protection against}} theft into new digital cable systems which were deployed {{beginning in the}} mid-1990s {{as part of the}} changeover to the new digital HDTV standard, along with assessing a large fine for the entire cost of a set-top box if the customer didn't return it upon the termination of services. This has greatly reduced cable theft, although pirate decryption continued on some DVB-C systems which are based on the same compromised encryption schemes formerly used in satellite television broadcasting. Most cable companies have also issued new secured outside <b>distribution</b> <b>boxes</b> which require certain keys only given out to their installers to access, making theft via outside split line more difficult.|$|E

5000|$|Cable {{television}} piracy, a form {{of copyright}} infringement, is the act of obtaining unauthorized access to cable television services. [...] In older analog cable systems, most cable channels were not encrypted and cable theft was often as easy as plugging a coaxial cable attached to the user's television into an apartment house cable distribution box (which often had no securing by a cable company employee such as a lock to prevent unauthorized access). In some rural areas nonsubscribers would even run long cables to <b>distribution</b> <b>boxes</b> on nearby utility poles. Set-top boxes were required with some systems, but these were generic, and often in an unknowing violation of contract, former customers would donate them to thrift stores for sale or retain them indefinitely in storage when they ended their subscription to the service rather than return them to the provider.|$|E
40|$|This Corrective Action Decision Document/Closure Report (CADD/CR) {{has been}} {{prepared}} for Corrective Action Unit (CAU) 500 : Test Cell A Septic System, {{in accordance with the}} Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order. Located in Area 25 at the Nevada Test Site in Nevada, CAU 500 is comprised of one Corrective Action Site, CAS 25 - 04 - 05. This CADD/CR identifies and rationalizes the U. S. Department of Energy, Nevada Operations Office's (DOE/NV's) recommendation that no corrective action is deemed necessary for CAU 500. The Corrective Action Decision Document and Closure Report have been combined into one report based on sample data collected during the field investigation performed between February and May 1999, which showed no evidence of soil contamination at this site. The clean closure justification for CAU 500 is based on these results. Analytes detected were evaluated against preliminary action levels (PALs) to determine contaminants of concern (COCs) for CAU 500, and it was determined that the PALs were not exceeded for total volatile organic compounds, total semivolatile organic compounds, total petroleum hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, total Resource Conservation and Recovery Act metals, gamma-emitting radionuclides, isotopic uranium, and strontium- 90 for any of the soil samples collected. COCs were identified only within the septic tank and <b>distribution</b> <b>box</b> at the CAU. No COCs were identified outside these two areas; therefore, no corrective action was necessary for the soil. Closure activities were performed to address the COCs identified within the septic tank and <b>distribution</b> <b>box.</b> The DOE/NV recommended that neither corrective action nor a corrective action plan was required at CAU 500. Further, no use restrictions were required to be placed on CAU 500, and the septic tank and <b>distribution</b> <b>box</b> have been closed in accordance with all applicable state and federal regulations for closure of the site...|$|R
