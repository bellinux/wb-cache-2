40|$|<b>Fibrillins</b> {{constitute}} the major backbone of multifunctional microfibrils in elastic and nonelastic extracellular matrices. Proper assembly mechanisms {{are central to}} the formation and function of these microfibrils, and their properties are often compromised in pathological circumstances such as in Marfan syndrome and in other fibrillinopathies. Here, we have used human dermal fibroblasts to analyze the assembly of fibrillin- 1 in dependence of other matrix-forming proteins. siRNA knockdown experiments demonstrated that the assembly of fibrillin- 1 is strictly dependent on the presence of extracellular fibronectin fibrils. Immunolabeling performed at the light and electron microscopic level showed colocalization of fibrillin- 1 with fibronectin fibrils at {{the early stages of the}} assembly process. Protein-binding assays demonstrated interactions of fibronectin with a C-terminal region of fibrillin- 1, - 2, and - 3 and with an N-terminal region of fibrillin- 1. The C-terminal half of fibrillin- 2 and - 3 had propensities to multimerize, as has been previously shown for fibrillin- 1. The C-terminal of all three <b>fibrillins</b> interacted strongly with fibronectin as multimers, but not as monomers.

40|$|Starch synthase 4 (SS 4) plays a {{specific}} role in starch synthesis because it controls {{the number of}} starch granules synthesized in the chloroplast and {{is involved in the}} initiation of the starch granule. We showed previously that SS 4 interacts with <b>fibrillins</b> 1 and is associated with plastoglobules, suborganelle compartments physically attached to the thylakoid membrane in chloroplasts. Both SS 4 localization and its interaction with <b>fibrillins</b> 1 were mediated by the N-terminal part of SS 4. Here we show that the coiled-coil region within the N-terminal portion of SS 4 is involved in both processes. Elimination of this region prevents SS 4 from binding to <b>fibrillins</b> 1 and alters SS 4 localization in the chloroplast. We also show that SS 4 forms dimers, which depends on a region located between the coiled-coil region and the glycosyltransferase domain of SS 4. This region is highly conserved between all SS 4 enzymes sequenced to date. Weshow that the dimerization seems to be necessary for the activity of the enzyme. Both dimerization and the functionality of the coiled-coil region are conserved among SS 4 proteins from phylogenetically distant species, such as Arabidopsis and Brachypodium. This finding suggests that the mechanism of action of SS 4 is conserved among different plant species. Peer reviewe...|$|R

All LTBPs, as well as <b>fibrillins,</b> contain multiple 8 -Cys repeats. We analyzed the abilities of <b>fibrillins</b> and LTBPs to bind latent TGF-β by their 8 -Cys repeats. 8 -Cys repeat was found to interact with TGF-β 1 •LAP by direct cysteine bridging. LTBP- 1 and LTBP- 3 bound efficiently all TGF-β isoforms, LTBP- 4 had a much weaker binding capacity, whereas LTBP- 2 as well as <b>fibrillins</b> - 1 and - 2 were negative. A short, specific TGF-β binding motif was identified in the TGF-β binding 8 -Cys repeats. Deletion of this motif in the 3 rd 8 -Cys repeat of LTBP- 1 resulted in loss of TGF-β•LAP binding ability, while its inclusion in non-TGF-β binding 3 rd 8 -Cys repeat of LTBP- 2 resulted in TGF-β binding.

Their importance in bone biology {{is illustrated by the}} skeletal abnormalities manifest in the congenital disorder, Marfan syndrome, which results from mutations in the fibrillin- 1 gene. We investigated the expression of <b>fibrillins</b> and other microfibril-associated proteins in human bone and bone-derived osteoblasts. Analysis of RNA extracted from cancellous bone showed expression of mRNAs encoding fibrillin- 1 and - 2, MAGP- 1 and - 2, LTBP- 2, and MP 78 / 70 (Big-h 3). In demineralized normal mature bone, fibrillin- 1 was immunolocalized to fibrils within the bone matrix and pericellularly to cells lining the endosteal surfaces of trabecular bone, some osteocytes, and cells associated with blood vessels. LTBP- 2 was also identified at the endosteal surface and within the bone matrix in a lamellar fashion. In addition, primary osteoblast-like cells cultured from human trabecular bone (obtained from patients at joint replacement surgery) were found to express abundant mRNA for <b>fibrillins</b> and associated glycoproteins. Moreover, using western blot analysis, fibrillin- 1 protein was shown to be secreted into the medium and to be deposited into the cell layer. Immunofluorescence staining of the cell layer visualized fibrillin- 1 in the matrix as a three-dimensional network of fine filaments. Expression of fibrillin- 1 by osteoblast-like cells was constitutive, and a number of skeletally active agents had little effect on mRNA or protein levels. These results show that human osteoblasts from mature bone express <b>fibrillins</b> and other microfibril-associated proteins, and suggest a role for these molecules in adult human bone...|$|R

40|$|Calcium binding (cb) {{epidermal}} growth factor-like (EGF) domains {{are found}} {{in a wide variety}} of extracellular proteins with diverse functions. In several proteins, including the <b>fibrillins</b> (1 and 2), the low-density lipoprotein receptor, the Notch receptor and related molecules, these domains are organised as multiple tandem repeats. The functional importance of calcium-binding by EGF domains has been underscored by the identification of missense mutations associated with defective calcium-binding, which have been linked to human diseases. Here, we present (15) N backbone relaxation data for a pair of cbEGF domains from fibrillin- 1, the defective protein in the Marfan syndrome. The data were best fit using a symmetric top model, confirming the extended conformation of the cbEGF domain pair. Our data demonstrate that calcium plays a key role in stabilising the rigidity of the domain pair on the pico- to millisecond time-scale. Strikingly, the most dynamically stable region of the construct is centred about the domain interface.

LHCs from photosystem II (LHCII) were isolated from the thylakoid membrane of Arabidopsis thaliana leaves after light stress treatment using sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and separated by gel-filtration into LHCII subcomplexes. Using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and two-dimensional (2 D) gel electrophoresis, the LHCII proteins, Lhcb 1 – 6 and <b>fibrillins,</b> were efficiently separated and identified by FTICR-MS. Some of the LHCII subcomplexes were shown to migrate from photosystem II to photosystem I as a result of short-term adaptation to changes in light intensity. In the mobile LHCII subcomplexes, decreased levels of <b>fibrillins</b> and a modified composition of LHCII protein isoforms were identified compared to the tightly bound LHCII subcomplexes. In addition, FTICR-MS analysis revealed several oxidative modifications of LHCII proteins.

40|$|Anterior {{cruciate}} ligament rupture (ACL) {{is a major}} source of morbidity in the dog, leading to severe osteoarthritis of the knee joint and marked lameness. Following rupture, the ACL will not heal and in the dog, ACL rupture is thought to be the end stage of degenerative ligament disease (non-contact ACL injury). The extracellular matrix (ECM) of CLs has been extensively studied but little is known of the role of elastic fibres in the physiology of the ECM, the mechanics of CL function and in CL degeneration. Elastic fibres include polymers of <b>fibrillins</b> (microfibrils), bundles of microfibrils (oxytalan fibres) and elastin fibres (bundles of microfibrils with an elastin core). The hypothesis of this thesis is that elastin has a mechanical and a biological role in the canine {{cruciate ligament}} complex. It is further hypothesised that the distribution and function of elastic fibres will vary between three breeds of dog with differing risk of ACL rupture are: the greyhound with a low risk, the beagle with a low-tomoderate risk and the Labrador retriever with a high risk. The distribution of elastic fibres, <b>fibrillins</b> and cells was investigated throughout the CL complex using a combination of histochemical staining and immunofluorescence.

This possibility is tested in this study. Results show that the prodomain of BMP- 5 interacts with the N-terminal regions of fibrillin- 1 and - 2 in a site similar to the binding sites for other bone morphogenetic proteins. However, in contrast, the prodomain of GDF- 8 (myostatin) interacts with the glycosaminoglycan side chains of perlecan. The binding site for the GDF- 8 prodomain is likely the heparan sulfate chain present on perlecan domain V. These results support and extend the emerging concept that TGFβ superfamily prodomains target their growth factor dimers to extracellular matrix macromolecules. In addition, biochemical studies of prodomain·growth factor complexes were performed to identify inactive complexes. For {{some members of the}} superfamily, the prodomain is noncovalently associated with its growth factor dimer in an inactive complex; for others, the prodomain·growth factor complex is active, even though the prodomain is noncovalently associated with its growth factor dimer. Results show that the BMP- 10 prodomain, in contrast to BMP- 4, - 5, and - 7 prodomains, can inhibit the bioactivity of the BMP- 10 growth factor and suggest that the BMP- 10 complex is like TGFβ and GDF- 8 complexes, which can be activated by cleavage of the associated prodomain...|$|R

40|$|Here we {{describe}} the high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure of a transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) -binding protein-like (TB) domain, which comes from human fibrillin- 1, the protein defective in the Marfan syndrome (MFS). This domain is found in <b>fibrillins</b> and latent TGF-beta-binding proteins (LTBPs) which are localized to fibrillar structures in the extracellular matrix. The TB domain manifests a novel fold which is globular and comprises six antiparallel beta-strands and two alpha-helices.

We show that Arabidopsis plants with reduced levels of these plastid structural proteins are impaired in long-term acclimation to environmental constraint, namely photooxidative stress imposed by high light combined with cold. As a result, their photosynthetic apparatus is inefficiently protected. This leads to the prevalence of an abnormal granal and stromal membrane arrangement, as well as higher photosystem II photoinhibition under stress. The visible phenotype of FIB 1 - 2 RNAi lines also includes retarded shoot growth and a deficit in anthocyanin accumulation under stress. All examined phenotypic effects of lower FIB levels are abolished by jasmonate (JA) treatment. An atypical expression pattern of several JA-induced genes was observed in RNAi plants. A JA-deficient mutant was found to share similar stress phenotypic characteristics with FIB RNAi plants. We conclude a new physiological role for JA, namely acclimation of chloroplasts, and that light/cold stress-related JA biosynthesis is conditioned by the accumulation of plastoglobule-associated FIB 1 - 2 proteins. Consistent correlative data suggest that this FIB effect is mediated by plastoglobule (and triacylglycerol) accumulation as the potential site for initiating the chloroplast stress-related JA biosynthesis...|$|R
