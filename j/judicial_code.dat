25|$|Combs rose to {{national}} prominence by successfully defending Appalachian Volunteers Margaret and Alan McSurely against charges of sedition {{in a case}} that took 15 years to fully adjudicate. After a long legal career, Combs unseated incumbent Elijah M. Hogge for a seat on the Kentucky Court of Appeals. In 1989, he challenged incumbent James B. Stephenson for his seat on the Kentucky Supreme Court. During the campaign, he attacked some of Stephenson's previous opinions in violation of a state <b>judicial</b> <b>code</b> that forbade judicial candidates from stating opinions related to cases they might later be asked to rule on. After the election, which Combs won, he was suspended for three months for violating the code, but the suspension was not carried out because Combs appealed the constitutionality of the code and eventually succeeded in overturning it.|$|E

25|$|On {{the night}} of the primary election, Combs {{publicly}} challenged Stephenson to a debate, to be televised on Kentucky Educational Television. Stephenson declined, citing a state <b>judicial</b> <b>code</b> forbidding candidates for judicial offices to discuss positions on issues that might come before them if elected. Combs maintained that this code violated the state constitution and the federal Constitution and refused to abide by it. He charged that Stephenson had too often sided with wealthy litigants over poorer ones including denying compensation to injured workers and upholding prohibitions on felons owning firearms, which Combs said violated the Second Amendment. Following an investigation, the Kentucky Judicial Retirement and Removal Commission ordered him suspended from the bench for three months without pay for violating the code in February 1990. Combs appealed on grounds that the code abridged his First Amendment right to free speech. The suspension was not carried out pending the outcome of Combs' appeal, and it was overturned in a case that ultimately was affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court.|$|E
500|$|The {{second of}} forty-one {{criminal}} cases {{heard by the}} Marshall Court, More ensured that the Court's criminal jurisprudence {{would be limited to}} writs of error from the state (and later, territorial) courts, original habeas petitions and writs of error from habeas petitions in the circuit courts, and certificates of division and mandamus from the circuit courts. Congress did not grant the Court jurisdiction to hear writs of error from the circuit courts in criminal cases until 1889, for capital crimes, and 1891, for other [...] "infamous" [...] crimes. The <b>Judicial</b> <b>Code</b> of 1911 abolished the circuit courts, transferred the trial of crimes to the district courts, and extended the Court's appellate jurisdiction to all crimes.

50|$|Much of the {{controversy}} has historically stemmed from Iran's status as a theocracy as it was established after the 1979 revolution; many policies, including those concerning social topics, are based on sharia law as interpreted from the Qur'an through the nation's Shi'a legal philosophy. While abortion is not actually referenced in the Qur'an, infanticide is specifically condemned, {{and this has been}} used as an argument to keep abortion illegal in most or all cases in which it might be sought. The sections of the Qur'an that detail the importance of health for women have been used to combat this argument, and have been moderately successful at changing the reactionary legislation against abortion enacted after 1979. Nowadays, most Islamic legal schools of thought hold that the ensoulment of a fetus takes place four months after conception, which has extended the discussion of abortion in many nations and communities that base their <b>judicial</b> <b>codes</b> off of Islamic law; in Iran, a consensus has recently developed that abortion is legitimate if it is before this four-month mark.|$|R
