5|$|Kansas {{received}} Virginia Tech's kickoff, and the Hokies {{attempted to}} <b>give</b> <b>themselves</b> another chance at offense by calling timeouts after Kansas rushed the ball. The timeouts stopped the clock, but Kansas managed {{to earn a}} first down and run out the clock after Tech used its allotted threetimeouts. Heading into halftime, Kansas still had the lead and the momentum, but a Virginia Tech touchdown had cut the Jayhawks' lead to just 10points, 177.|$|E

To do this, they eject a mixture of chemicals, which may mimic food or otherwise confuse predators. In response to a predator, animals in these groups release ink, creating a cloud, and opaline, affecting the predator's feeding senses, causing it to attack the cloud.|$|E
5|$|The {{experiment}} {{is now in}} full flow with the gas affecting the townspeople's thinking. About half the town, including Frantz and Suzanne, talk revolution. Others <b>give</b> <b>themselves</b> to pleasure. Fritz and Suzel sing of making love until the day they die. The political agitators intend to overthrow the town council but Niklausse and Van Tricasse persuade them instead to attack a neighbouring town over an incident 700 years earlier involving a stray cow. Frantz is appointed the war leader for pledging to kill the most people.|$|E

5|$|Later in the advance, Maxwell learnt from an English-speaking {{prisoner}} that a {{group of}} Germans in the adjacent post wished to surrender, but were afraid to <b>give</b> <b>themselves</b> up. Accompanied by two privates and the prisoner—who was to act as an interpreter—Maxwell approached the post. The three Australians, however, were immediately surrounded by a group of twenty German soldiers and disarmed. They seemed set to become prisoners themselves, before an artillery barrage fell on the position. Taking advantage of the resulting confusion, Maxwell pulled out a concealed revolver and shot two of the Germans before escaping with his men under heavy rifle fire; one of the privates was subsequently wounded. Organising a party of men, he immediately attacked and captured the post.|$|E
5|$|On 7 August {{the three}} Allied commanders– Marlborough, Baden and Eugene– met to decide their strategy. To <b>give</b> <b>themselves</b> another major {{crossing}} over the Danube a plan by Baden to besiege {{the city of}} Ingolstadt with a force of 15,000 men was agreed to, despite leaving the Allied army numerically inferior. This army, totalling 52,000 men and now without the commander who led the Imperial troops on the Schellenberg, would meet the Franco-Bavarian forces, numbering 56,000 men, {{in and around the}} small village of Blindheim. The engagement, fought on 13 August 1704, would become known in German as the Battle of Höchstädt, and in English, as the Battle of Blenheim.|$|E
5|$|Argyle {{lost three}} of their next nine matches to <b>give</b> <b>themselves</b> a chance of {{avoiding}} relegation, but their win at Doncaster Rovers {{proved to be the}} last game that they would collect any points in. Defeats at home to Middlesbrough and away to Watford left the club {{on the brink of a}} return to England's third tier, and that was confirmed in their next game. Newcastle United won 2–0 at Home Park to secure the Championship title, and relegated the home side at the same time. The club finished 23rd in the league table after defeat by bottom club Peterborough United on the final day of the season, eight points adrift of safety. Jamie Mackie finished as the club's top scorer with eight goals in all competitions, and captain Carl Fletcher was voted Player of the Year.|$|E

5|$|Gwyneth {{stands in}} the middle of an arch and opens the rift, {{allowing}} the Gelth to cross over. The number of Gelth is much greater than anticipated, and their true motive is revealed: they intend to kill the living to <b>give</b> <b>themselves</b> more hosts and take over the planet. One of the animated bodies strangles Sneed to death, allowing another Gelth to possess his body. Dickens flees the parlour, and Rose and the Doctor are trapped in a part of the basement. Outside, Dickens realises that the beings are affected by gas and returns to the house. He extinguishes the gaslights and turns the gas on full, pulling the Gelth out of the bodies. The Doctor tells Gwyneth to send the Gelth back and close the rift, but she cannot close it or leave. Instead she takes out a box of matches, intending to ignite the gas and kill the Gelth along with herself. The Doctor determines that Gwyneth is already dead, and that by opening the rift, she had doomed herself. The Doctor, Rose, and Dickens flee the parlour just before it explodes and burns, killing Gwyneth and the Gelth.|$|E
5|$|Later, Alan and Joanna are {{stopped by}} a {{policeman}} on suspicion of stealing the campervan. Joanna gets her peanut-butter sandwich and smears it in the policeman's face. Alan and Joanna have an argument about the minute odds of the policeman having a peanut allergy and going into anaphylaxis, while in the background this is actually happening. They then carry {{the body of the}} policeman into the van. Soon, having run out of food and petrol, Alan changes the engine to run on alcohol and fermented excrement. The plan is of no use however, as the van explodes. They soon reach the beach and Joanna gives Alan three options: <b>Give</b> <b>themselves</b> up, swim the Channel to Spain or commit suicide. As Alan is not keen on the Spanish, they choose the third option and they are last seen walking naked into the sea, presumably to their deaths - although the alternate ending shows them hanging on to a buoy sometime later.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Connors {{is fired}} by the school board due to the {{violence}} associated with wrestling, after the board fails {{to make a distinction}} between what he teaches and professional wrestling (as do the town bar regulars). They also find videos of Greco-Roman and freestyle wrestling on his iPhone and mistake them for gay pornography. The boys are excited to learn WWE Chairman Vince McMahon has heard of their federation and will be scouting one of their shows. Mr. Connors sits in his apartment surrounded by awards for wrestling and in tears over his termination and what wrestling has become. Vengeful, he plans to sabotage the event in a personal vow to restore the integrity of the wrestling sport. Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny secretly decide to relegate Butters, Jimmy and Token to smaller roles, thinking that it will <b>give</b> <b>themselves</b> a better opportunity to impress McMahon. They hold tryouts {{in the manner of a}} theater audition in order to find new talent for their show, which is now more reminiscent of musical theatre than wrestling.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} few months, RhAR patrols in the Chaah, Labis, Bekok and Sungai Karas areas were stepped up to last between 10 and 18 days each, but {{contacts}} with the communist forces remained rare. The constant patrols gradually began to take their toll on the insurgents, and guerrillas began to <b>give</b> <b>themselves</b> up increasingly frequently. A contributing factor here was Britain's granting of independence to Malaya within the Commonwealth on 31 August 1957, which dented the motivation of many fighters. Starting in October 1957, the RhAR were tasked to work alongside former MNLA personnel to wipe out any remaining communist forces in the region. The ex-insurgents were supposed to lead the security forces to MNLA camps and resting places, but this strategy was not successful. The RhAR soon developed a low opinion of these ex-MNLA men.|$|E
5|$|Richard I was crowned King in 1189 and {{announced}} {{his intention to}} join the Crusades; this inflamed anti-Jewish sentiment. Rumours began to spread that the king had ordered that the English Jews be attacked. In York, tensions broke out into violence the following year. Richard de Malbis, who owed money to the powerful Jewish merchant Aaron of Lincoln, exploited an accidental house fire to incite a local mob to attack the home and family of a recently deceased Jewish employee of Aaron in York. Josce of York, {{the leader of the}} Jewish community, led the local Jewish families into the royal castle, where they took refuge in the wooden keep. The mob surrounded the castle, and when the constable left the castle to discuss the situation, the Jews, fearing the entry of the mob or being handed over to the sheriff, refused to allow him back in. The constable appealed to the sheriff, who called out his own men and laid siege to the keep. The siege continued until 16 March when the Jews' position became untenable. Their religious leader, Rabbi Yomtob, proposed an act of collective suicide to avoid being killed by the mob, and the castle was set on fire to prevent their bodies being mutilated after their deaths. Several Jews perished in the flames but the majority took their own lives rather than <b>give</b> <b>themselves</b> up to the mob. A few Jews did surrender, promising to convert to Christianity, but they were killed by the angry crowd. Around 150 Jews died in total in the massacre. The keep was rebuilt, again in wood, on the motte, which was raised in height by 13 feet (4 metres) at a cost of £207.|$|E
5|$|When {{the crew}} awaken, they find {{themselves}} out of the control beds {{with no sign of}} the Gangers. However, their own personal belongings have been gone through and the TARDIS has sunk into acid-corroded ground. The Doctor explains that they have likely been unconscious {{for more than an hour}} and the Gangers have gained sentience. They soon discover that two of the Gangers are amongst them, posing as Cleaves and Jennifer (Sarah Smart), when the two <b>give</b> <b>themselves</b> away by turning pale-white. Jennifer also exhibits the ability to contort and stretch her body well beyond human limits. The Jennifer Ganger struggles with her new identity and befriends Rory who has begun to demonstrate an emotional attachment to her. The Cleaves Ganger works in secret with the other Gangers to try to kill the real humans, as the human Cleaves plans to kill the Gangers. The Doctor attempts to reunite the two sides but fails when the human Cleaves kills one of the Gangers with a high-powered electrical charge. The Gangers plan an attack, and the Doctor accuses Cleaves of killing a living being which Cleaves refuses to acknowledge. The Ganger Jennifer hunts her human counterpart to kill her. The Doctor determines that in a monastery, the safest place to be is the chapel, and directs everyone there. The Gangers, in acid-protection suits, bear down on the chapel. Rory responds to the sound of Jennifer screaming by deliberately separating from the group, against Amy's wishes. In the chapel, Amy and the Doctor discover a Ganger version of the Doctor.|$|E

25|$|All eleven {{players on}} the pitch have a {{defensive}} role. Which roles they are assigned, depends on tactics. In principle, {{there are two ways}} of defending, zone defence and man-to-man defense. In a zone defence, defensive players mainly move in relation to each other, whereas a man-to-man defence mainly moves in relation to opposing players. Whenever defensive players are given, or <b>give</b> <b>themselves,</b> a larger degree of freedom, hybrids of the two are seen.|$|E
