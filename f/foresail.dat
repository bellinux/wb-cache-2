5|$|Agamemnon {{was part}} of Vice-Admiral Robert Calder's fleet {{cruising}} off Cape Finisterre on 22 July 1805, when the combined Franco-Spanish fleet from the West Indies was sighted to windward. The British ships formed into line of battle, with Agamemnon fifth in the line, and engaged Admiral Villeneuve's fleet in hazy conditions with light winds. Agamemnon had three men wounded in the Battle of Cape Finisterre, and lost her mizzen topmast and the <b>foresail</b> yard. By nightfall, Calder's fleet had become scattered, and he signalled for the action to be discontinued.|$|E
5|$|The British fleet was {{anchored}} off The Rock on 10December 1796 when a storm blew up. Culloden {{was obliged}} {{to get under way}} when her anchors failed to hold, narrowly missing Pearl Rock in the process, and at 21:00, Gibraltar was forced to cut her cable. As she was attempting to get clear of Cabrita Point at 22:00, her fore topmast snapped and her <b>foresail,</b> mainsail, main topmast staysail, and mizzen staysail tore. Having already lost her main topsail, she became difficult to handle and struck the sandbank several times before being blown across it. By midnight Gibraltar was out of danger and able to ride out the storm, and the next day at noon she anchored in Tangier Bay. The damage incurred during the storm necessitated her being sent to Plymouth in January 1797. During the repairs, which took until April and cost £12,818, a large piece of rock was removed from her hull. Gibraltar returned to the Mediterranean in July 1797 under Captain William Hancock Kelly.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{purpose built}} fishing vessels were designed and made by David Allan in Leith in March 1875, when he converted a drifter to steam power. In 1877, he {{built the first}} screw propelled steam trawler in the world. This vessel was Pioneer LH854. She was of wooden construction with two masts and carried a gaff rigged main and mizen using booms, and a single <b>foresail.</b> Allan argued that his motivation for steam power was to increase the safety of fishermen. However local fishermen saw power trawling as a threat. Allan built a total of ten boats at Leith between 1877 and 1881. Twenty-one boats were completed at Granton, his last vessel being Degrave in 1886. Most of these were sold to foreign owners in France, Belgium, Spain and the West Indies.|$|E
50|$|Triangular staysails {{set forward}} of the {{foremost}} mast are called jibs, headsails, or <b>foresails.</b> The innermost such sail on a cutter, schooner, and many other rigs having two or more <b>foresails</b> is referred to simply as the staysail, while the others {{are referred to as}} jibs, flying jibs, etc.|$|R
50|$|By {{moving the}} mast {{toward the back}} of the sailboat, {{designers}} can increase the size and driving power of the more efficient <b>foresails.</b> The mainsail is reduced in size or eliminated altogether. An advantage of using <b>foresails,</b> also called staysails, is that they may be rigged for roller furling. This allows the sail(s) to quickly and easily be deployed and reefed by pulling lines. The sail rolls up around the stay. This simplicity and easy operation is one of the main attractions of the mast aft rig.|$|R
5000|$|A ketch may be {{distinguished}} from a cutter or a sloop by virtue of having two masts rather than one, though a ketch with two <b>foresails</b> is sometimes called a [...] "cutter-rigged ketch".|$|R
500|$|The wind, tide and sea made it {{impossible}} for the Liverpool lifeboat to link up with the waiting tug for another tow, so the men were forced to start rowing home. [...] About twenty minutes later, as the boat reached the safer waters of the channel, the master elected to raise the <b>foresail</b> to help steady the vessel. [...] People in the lifeboat were still congratulating themselves on their lucky escape, when Captain Martin noticed a huge wave [...] "like a high wall" [...] approaching. He instructed everyone to hold on, fearing that someone might be washed overboard. [...] However rather than breaking over the boat, the wave lifted it and flipped it over. The boat was not self-righting, so the remaining survivors were left clinging desperately to the upturned boat. Rattlers master witnessed the incident, signaled to the New Brighton lifeboat, Willie and Arthur, which promptly turned around to come to the rescue. The men who were on the capsized boat directed the New Brighton lifeboat to first assist three others who were in more danger clinging to bits of wood in the sea. After picking up the survivors and one casualty, the New Brighton lifeboat was taken in tow by Rattler, which brought her back to New Brighton. [...] Six of Ellen Southards crew, the captain and his wife, as well as the pilot and three lifeboat men from Mersey Docks drowned or died of exposure (12 fatalities in total).|$|E
500|$|Temeraire then rammed {{into the}} Redoutable, {{dismounting}} {{many of the}} French ship's guns, and worked her way alongside, after which her crew lashed the two ships together. Temeraire now poured continuous broadsides into the French ship, taking fire {{as she did so}} from the 112-gun Spanish ship Santa Ana lying off her stern, and from the 74-gun French ship Fougueux, which came up on Temeraires un-engaged starboard side. Harvey ordered his gun crews to hold fire until Fougueux came within point blank range. Temeraires first broadside against Fougueux at a range of 100yards caused considerable damage to the Frenchman's rigging, and she drifted into Temeraire, whose crew promptly lashed her to the side. Temeraire was now lying between two French 74-gun ships. As Harvey later recalled {{in a letter to his}} wife [...] "Perhaps never was a ship so circumstanced as mine, to have for more than three hours two of the enemy's line of battle ships lashed to her." [...] Redoutable, sandwiched between Victory and Temeraire, suffered heavy casualties, reported by Captain Lucas as amounting to 300 dead and 222 wounded. During the fight grenades thrown from the decks and topmasts of Redoutable killed and wounded a number of Temeraires crew and set her starboard rigging and <b>foresail</b> on fire. There was a brief pause in the fighting while both sides worked to douse the flames. Temeraire narrowly escaped destruction when a grenade thrown from Redoutable exploded on her maindeck, nearly igniting the after-magazine. Master-At-Arms John Toohig prevented the fire from spreading and saved not only Temeraire, but the surrounding ships, which would have been caught in the explosion.|$|E
2500|$|By ten in {{the morning}} the wind had dropped, and the ship began to roll violently. The {{foremast}} was rolled over, destroying the <b>foresail.</b>|$|E
50|$|Roller furling is {{a method}} of furling or reefing a sail by rolling it around a stay or {{rotating}} spar. Roller furling is most prominent on <b>foresails</b> such as jibs, followed by mainsails.|$|R
50|$|S - Measured Sail area, up to 1923 to British Navy method, then amended for 3/4 mast-height jibstay and <b>foresails,</b> {{after the}} 1928 IYRU London Conference same as Metre-boats of the International Rule. See J-Class.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} sprit-boom is {{found on a}} sprit-boomed leg-of-mutton sail. Sprit booms have been {{combined}} with a leech spar called a club; they have been used on <b>foresails,</b> like the jib. Some sailors have used a sprit boom on the standing lug sail.|$|R
2500|$|After {{rebuilding}} in the 1980s {{she is now}} [...] long, [...] {{wide and}} [...] deep and measures [...] She now has a wheel {{and was in the}} staysail class of sailing barge. Her current sails are a jib, <b>foresail,</b> mainsail and topsail on the mainmast, and a mizzen sail on the mizzen-mast aft. Initially engined in 1943, she has been powered since 1980 by a Ford diesel. more recently the barge has been fitted with a bowsprit.|$|E
2500|$|Seneca mustered a force {{armed with}} rifles, called away a boat, {{and ordered the}} master to haul down his <b>foresail.</b> The crew of the schooner, without waiting for {{instructions}} from the master, immediately jumped to the sail and hauled it down. Boatswain I. E. Johannessen took an armed boarding party on board Tomoka and ordered the [...] "rummy" [...] crew below decks. Meanwhile, Seneca was lying less than [...] off, with another armed party on the bow. No further difficulty was encountered. The vessels arrived off Staten Island at 23:30 and turned Tomoka and her crew over to Lexington, including Bill McCoy himself.|$|E
2500|$|Seneca then {{instructed}} Tomoka {{that she}} would be sunk by gunfire unless she proceeded toward New York City. The rum-runner started in that direction, but then suddenly started its engine, hoisted the fore staysail and stood rapidly to eastward. Seneca gave chase and opened fire. [...] The first shot was fired across the bow of the fleeing schooner, then the range was gradually decreased. After three warning shots, a fourth shot was fired to hit. The shell landed alongside a few feet from Tomoka, and the schooner immediately stopped engines, hauled down the fore staysail and headed into the wind with her <b>foresail</b> idly flapping.|$|E
50|$|To assist {{going to}} windward, a ketch may carry {{one or more}} jibs or <b>foresails.</b> If a ketch has no jibs, it is called a cat ketch or a periauger. On older, larger ketches the main mast may in {{addition}} carry one or more square rigged topsails.|$|R
5000|$|Sails {{set forward}} of the mainmast, such as jibs and staysails, are {{sometimes}} referred to as <b>foresails,</b> although [...] "headsails" [...] is a more common term, headsail can also specifically refer to the sail on a forestay that connects directly {{to the head of the}} mast.|$|R
50|$|Coromandel {{measured}} 133 ft x 33 ft x 23 ft. She was a 3 masted square rigged {{ship with}} 13 <b>foresails,</b> 3 top sails, 3 fore topmast stay sails, 2 main sails, 3 main top sails and well found. She had one long boat and two quarter boats. The ship {{was made from}} oak, black birch, and red pine. She was sheathed in yellow metal.|$|R
2500|$|SuomenJoutsen is a steel-hulled full rigged {{ship with}} three square rigged steel masts. Both main mast and bow mast have six yards, the longest ones being [...] long and {{weighing}} four tons, while the mizzenmast has five yards. The height of her main mast, {{which consists of}} three parts, is [...] from the waterline. The sail area of SuomenJoutsen is [...] and three sets of sails, each weighing three tons, were carried on training voyages. Her standing and running rigging consist of over [...] of manilla ropes and steel cables. The typical sailing speed of SuomenJoutsen was around , but once in the North Sea she reached a record speed of [...] with only topsails and the <b>foresail.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Dr. John Tilley {{noted that}} [...] "the Massachusetts was a two-masted {{schooner}} of 70 43/95 tons burden, 60 ' in length, with {{a beam of}} 17' 8" [...] and depth of hold of 7' 8". [...] The ship had a long quarterdeck, deep bulwarks, and an armament of either four of six swivel guns. [...] The contract signed by Searle and Tyler called for two boats and seven sails: mainsail, <b>foresail,</b> jib, flying jib, fore topsail, main topsail, and squaresail." [...] The cutter ended up being larger than originally authorized as her first master, [...] John Foster Williams, ordered an increase in her size without first seeking departmental approval. [...] Her cost was therefore considerably over the original estimate. [...] Nevertheless, the government accepted her as built.|$|E
60|$|Vessels in a gale of wind are laid-to in {{different}} manners, {{according to their}} peculiar construction. Some lie-to best under a <b>foresail,</b> and this, I believe, is the sail most usually employed. Large square-rigged vessels have sails for the express purpose, called storm-staysails. But the jib is occasionally employed by itself,--sometimes the jib and <b>foresail,</b> or a double-reefed <b>foresail,</b> and not unfrequently the after-sails, are made use of. Foretopsails are very often found to answer the purpose {{better than any other}} species of sail. The Grampus was generally laid-to under a close-reefed <b>foresail.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Galway hooker (Irish: húicéir) is a {{traditional}} fishing boat used in Galway Bay off {{the west coast of}} Ireland. The hooker was developed for the strong seas there. It is identified by its sharp, clean entry, bluff bow, marked tumblehome and raked transom. Its sail plan consists of a single mast with a main sail and two <b>foresails.</b> Traditionally, the boat is black (being coated in pitch) and the sails are a dark red-brown.|$|R
50|$|Whilst {{the cutter}} rig with twin <b>foresails</b> {{was once the}} {{standard}} rig for most cruising yachts until the 1960s (when it began {{to be replaced by}} the two-sail sloop rig) it is now only commonly found on larger cruising yachts (usually around 15 m and over). Other rig variations are found on many different sizes of yacht such as the yawl, ketch, schooner and even unusual sail plans such as the junk rig.|$|R
5|$|Finally at 7:58pm, President ceased {{fire and}} hoisted {{a light in}} her rigging, {{indicating}} that she had surrendered. Endymion ceased firing on the defeated American ship but did not board to take possession of her prize, {{due to a lack}} of undamaged boats. Endymions <b>foresails</b> had been damaged in the engagement and while she hove to for repairs, Decatur took advantage of the situation and, despite having struck, made off to escape at 8.30pm; Endymion, hastily completed repairs and resumed the chase at 8.52pm.|$|R

50|$|In {{the typical}} Bermuda rig, the sails located {{in front of}} the mast {{generally}} deliver a higher percentage of the driving force. The stay that supports {{the leading edge of the}} sail causes far less turbulence than a mast, resulting in better airflow across the lee side of the sail. To take advantage of this fact, Bermuda rigs are shifting towards larger fore-sails and smaller mainsails. Fore-sails include jibs, genoas and staysails. The cutter, with its use of multiple <b>foresails,</b> achieves the same goal of placing a higher percentage of the sail area in staysails.|$|R
60|$|The eight yachts {{were all}} within {{a length of}} each other, and a cheer broke from the boats around as they sped on their way. For a time there was but little {{difference}} between them, and then the cutters began to show a little in front. Their long booms gave them an advantage over the schooners and the yawl when before the wind; the spinnaker was not then invented, and the wind was not sufficiently dead aft to enable the schooners to carry their mainsail and <b>foresails,</b> wing and wing; or for the yawl's mizzen to help her.|$|R
6000|$|Dominic went forward. He {{paused to}} look down at Cesar, who, as I have said before, was lying full length face down by the foremast, then stepped over him, and dived out of my sight under the <b>foresail.</b> I saw nothing ahead. It was {{impossible}} for me to see anything except the <b>foresail</b> open and still, like a great shadowy wing. But Dominic had his bearings. His voice came to me from forward, in a just audible cry: ...|$|E
60|$|The topmast was lowered, small jib and <b>foresail</b> got up, and two reefs {{put in the}} mainsail; {{then they}} began to get up the anchor.|$|E
6000|$|All {{this time}} the {{business}} of the ship had gone on. The wind increased steadily, until, as the sun went down, Captain Truck announced it, in the cabin, to be a [...] "regular-built gale of wind." [...] Sail after sail had been reduced or furled until the Montauk was lying-to under her <b>foresail,</b> a close-reefed main-top-sail, a fore-top-mast stay-sail, and a mizzen stay-sail. Doubts were even entertained whether the second of these sails would not have to be handed soon, and the <b>foresail</b> itself reefed.|$|E
50|$|The huge {{ship had}} a length overall of 92.65 metres with {{bowsprit}} and jibboom: 110,8 metres (363 feet), 18.59 metres wide and 10.36 metres tall (304 feet × 61 feet × 34 feet). She was rigged as a four-masted barque, with the square-rigged masts fitted with just three square sails (course, top, and topgallant sails) and the spanker mast with a spanker sail and a spanker topsail. Three <b>foresails</b> were fitted to the stays to the jibboom making 14 sails all in all. Instead of a bobstay {{the end of}} the bowsprit was supported by an extra spar (bar) resting on the cutwater above the waterline.|$|R
5000|$|The USS President was {{an unusually}} fast frigate and by noon had gained on the Belvidera, now only some {{two and a}} half miles distant, {{approximately}} 75 miles south-west of Nantucket island. While the President was closing its distance with Belvidera Captain Byron began clearing the decks and preparing for action and made ready his stern guns. By 4:30 the wind had relaxed some but the Belvidera was now close enough to be engaged. Seizing this first and tenuous possibility, the Presidents forecastle bow chasers fired the first shot of the war, by Rodgers himself, with two more almost immediately following. All three shots struck Belvidera at her stern, striking the rudder assembly and captains quarters, killing or wounding nine men. [...] With only a few more shots needed to disable the British vessel the President fired again, but the tide of battle turned when one of its guns burst, killing 16 men, wounding others, including Rodgers, who was violently thrown back with his leg broken from the impact. [...] There was a pause of panic about the entire ship, as now every gun was suspected. Byron seized the opportunity and fired his stern chasers, killing yet another six men. The Belvidera continued a brisk fire, causing damage to the rigging and <b>foresails.</b> The President continued chase, but without adequate <b>foresails</b> to stabilize her bearing she began yawing and losing ground, allowing the Belvidera to escape and return to Halifax, taking with her the news of the declaration of war.|$|R
60|$|Ten {{years ago}} all the bawleys were clinker-built--that is, with the streaks {{overlapping}} each other, as in boats; {{but the new}} bawleys are now all carvel-built, the planks being placed edge to edge, so as to give a smooth surface, as in yachts and large vessels. They now {{for the most part}} carry spinnakers, boomed out when running before the wind, and balloon <b>foresails,</b> thereby greatly adding to their speed in light winds. One peculiarity of the bawleys is that, when at anchor, the mainsail, instead of being stowed with its spars parallel to the deck, is made up on its gaff, which is then hoisted with the throat seven or eight feet up the mast, while the peak rests on the stern.|$|R
