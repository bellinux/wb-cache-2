40|$|Background: Human {{bone marrow}} and {{umbilical}} cord blood are sources of allogeneic <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> for transplantation, {{which is a}} life-saving treatment {{in a variety of}} diseases but is burdened by delayed T-cell reconstitution. Observational studies evaluating T-cell reconstitution in post-transplant recipients suggest that cord blood <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> have a more effective capacity for T-cell reconstitution. This study focuses on the comparison of the capacity of cord blood and bone marrow <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> to generate T cells in vitro. Design and Methods: <b>Hematopoietic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> were cultured in OP 9 -delta-like- 1 and OP 9 -green fluorescent protein co-cultures to estimate T and myeloid generation capacity, respectively. Phenotypic markers of T-lineage or myeloid differentiation were measured by flow cytometry and used to analyze their kinetics as a function of culture time. <b>Hematopoietic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> were labeled with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinamidyl ester and analyzed after culture to track their phenotypic progression in consecutive generations. Mixed OP 9 -delta-like- 1 co-cultures were done with either carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinamidyl ester-labeled bone marrow and unlabeled cord blood <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> or vice versa, to evaluate their mutual influence on T-lineage differentiation. The T-cell potential of <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> was addressed quantitatively by limiting dilution analysis. Results: Bulk cultures showed faster and more extensive T-cell differentiation by cord blood <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> Furthermore, the T-lymphoid differentiation capacity of cord blood and bone marrow <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> can be discriminated very early based on the coordinated expression of CD 34 and CD 7. Mixing experiments with cord blood <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> and bone marrow <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> showed that these differences are cell intrinsic. Quantitative clonal analyses demonstrated that CD 34 (+) CD 38 (-/lo) <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> from cord blood contained a two-fold higher T-lineage generation capacity than CD 34 (+) CD 38 (-/lo) bone marrow <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> whereas the myeloid differentiation was similar. Conclusions: Our data shows that cord blood <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> have higher T-lymphoid differentiation potential than bone marrow <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> and that this property is cell autonomous...|$|R

40|$|The only {{cells of}} the hematopoietic system that undergo {{self-renewal}} for the lifetime of the organism are long-term <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> and memory T and B cells. To determine {{whether there is a}} shared transcriptional program among these self-renewing populations, we first compared the gene-expression profiles of naïve, effector and memory CD 8 + T cells with those of long-term <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> short-term <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> and lineage-committed progenitors. Transcripts augmented in memory CD 8 + T cells relative to naïve and effector T cells were selectively enriched in long-term <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> and were progressively lost in their short-term and lineage-committed counterparts. Furthermore, transcripts selectively decreased in memory CD 8 + T cells were selectively down-regulated in long-term <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> and progressively increased with differentiation. To confirm that this pattern was a general property of immunologic memory, we turned to independently generated gene expression profiles of memory, naïve, germinal center, and plasma B cells. Once again, memory-enriched and -depleted transcripts were also appropriately augmented and diminished in long-term <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> and their expression correlated with progressive loss of self-renewal function. Thus, {{there appears to be a}} common signature of both up- and down-regulated transcripts shared between memory T cells, memory B <b>cells,</b> and long-term <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> This signature was not consistently enriched in neural or embryonic <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> populations and, therefore, appears to be restricted to the hematopoeitic system.

40|$|Abstract: In the adult, {{the source}} of {{functionally}} diverse, mature blood <b>cells</b> are <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> a rare population of quiescent cells that reside in the bone marrow niche. Like <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> in other tissues, <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> are defined by their ability to self-renew, {{in order to maintain}} the <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> population for the lifetime of the organism, and to differentiate, in order to give rise to the multiple lineages of the hematopoietic system. In recent years, increasing evidence has suggested a role for the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and DNA damage in the decision for <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> to exit quiescence and to differentiate. In this review, we will examine recent work supporting the idea that detection of cell stressors, such as oxidative and genetic damage, is an important mediator of cell fate decisions in <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> We will explore the benefits of such a system in avoiding the development and progression of malignancies, and in avoiding tissue exhaustion and failure. Additionally, we will discuss new work that examines the accumulation of DNA damage and replication stress in aging <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> and causes us to rethink ideas of genoprotection in the bone marrow niche...|$|R

Objective: To evaluate the association between peripheral blood CD 34 + cell count and the successful collection of <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> Materials and methods: A predictive test evaluation study was carried out to establish the usefulness of peripheral blood CD 34 + cell count {{as a predictor of}} successful <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> collection in patients that will receive an autologous transplantation. Results: 77 patients were included (median age: 49 years; range: 5 - 66). The predominant baseline diagnosis was lymphoma (53. 2 %).

25|$|The cancellous part {{of bones}} contain bone marrow. Bone marrow {{produces}} blood cells {{in a process}} called hematopoiesis. Blood cells that are created in bone marrow include red blood cells, platelets and white blood cells. Progenitor cells such as the <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> divide in a process called mitosis to produce precursor cells. These include precursors which eventually give rise to white blood cells, and erythroblasts which give rise to red blood cells. Unlike red and white blood cells, created by mitosis, platelets are shed from very large cells called megakaryocytes. This process of progressive differentiation occurs within the bone marrow. After the cells are matured, they enter the circulation. Every day, over 2.5 billion red blood cells and platelets, and 50–100 billion granulocytes are produced in this way.|$|E
25|$|Autologous <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> {{transplantation}} (HSCT) {{is based}} on the assumption that autoimmune diseases like systemic sclerosis occur when the white blood cells of the immune system attack the body. In this treatment, stem cells from the patient's blood are extracted and stored to preserve them. The patient's white blood cells are destroyed with cyclophosphamide and rabbit antibodies against the white blood cells. Then the stored blood is returned to the patient's bloodstream to reconstitute a healthy blood and immune system which will not attack the body. The results of a phase 3 trial, the Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation International Scleroderma (ASTIS) trial, with 156 patients were published in 2014. HSCT itself has a high treatment mortality, so in the first year, the survival of patients in the treatment group was lower than the placebo group, but at the end of 10 years, the survival in the treatment group was significantly higher. The authors concluded that HSCT could be effective, if limited to patients who were healthy enough to survive HSCT itself. Therefore, HSCT should be given early in the progression of the disease, before it does damage. Patients with heart disease, and patients who smoked cigarettes, were less likely to survive. Another trial, the Stem Cell Transplant vs. Cyclophosphamide (SCOT) trial, is ongoing.|$|E
