5|$|Model's true {{opinion on}} the value of the {{offensive}} remains unclear. Manstein took his recommendation at face value, while Guderian said that he was categorically against attacking. It <b>has</b> <b>similarly</b> been suggested that Model, in fact, hoped to scuttle the operation by causing it to be delayed until the Soviet forces launched their own attack.|$|E
5|$|Like all azhdarchid pterosaurs, Hatzegopteryx was {{probably}} a terrestrially foraging generalist predator. It is significantly larger than any other terrestrial predator from Maastrichtian Europe; due to its large size in an environment otherwise dominated by island dwarf dinosaurs, with no large hypercarnivorous theropods in the region, {{it has been suggested}} that Hatzegopteryx played the role of an apex predator in the Haţeg Island ecosystem. The robust anatomy of Hatzegopteryx suggests that it may have tackled larger prey than other azhdarchids, including animals too large to swallow whole; similarly, some modern storks (particularly the marabou stork and the jabiru) are known to attack and kill large prey such as flamingoes, and occasionally children, with their beaks. Meanwhile, other giant azhdarchids like Arambourgiania would probably have instead fed on small prey (up to the size of a human), including hatchling or small dinosaurs and eggs. Another pterosaur, Thalassodromeus, <b>has</b> <b>similarly</b> been suggested to be raptorial.|$|E
5|$|The tooth resembles multituberculates—a {{large group}} of extinct mammals with many-cusped teeth—in {{the shapes of the}} valleys and crests, but multituberculates lack fossae and usually have quadrangular teeth with two {{longitudinal}} rows of cusps separated by a central valley. In the same features, LACM 149371 resembles gondwanatheres, a small and enigmatic group of mammals from the Cretaceous through Eocene of the southern (Gondwanan) continents that may be related to multituberculates. In particular, Ferugliotherium from the late Cretaceous of Argentina <b>has</b> <b>similarly</b> formed cusps and also has crests that connect the cusps {{to the center of the}} tooth. However, the upper molars are unknown, and the low-crowned teeth of Ferugliotherium lack deep fossae. Members of the higher-crowned gondwanathere family Sudamericidae do have fossae. Goin and colleagues conclude that LACM 149371 most likely represents a member of the gondwanathere family Ferugliotheriidae; if so, it would be among the youngest known gondwanatheres.|$|E

5|$|Tactically, Messi {{plays in}} a free attacking role; a {{versatile}} player, {{he is capable of}} attacking on either wing or through the centre of the pitch. His favoured position in childhood was the playmaker behind two strikers, known as the enganche in Argentine football, but he began his career in Spain as a left-winger or left-sided forward. Upon his first-team debut, he was moved onto the right wing by manager Frank Rijkaard; from this position, he could more easily cut through the defence {{into the middle of the}} pitch and curl shots on goal with his left foot, rather than predominantly cross balls for teammates. Under Guardiola and subsequent managers, he most often played in a false nine role; positioned as a centre-forward or lone striker, he would roam the centre, often moving deep into midfield and drawing defenders with him, in order to create and exploit spaces for passes, dribbling runs or combinations with Xavi and Iniesta. Under the stewardship of Luis Enrique, Messi returned to playing in the right-sided position that characterised much of his early career, while also being deployed in a deeper, free role. With the Argentina national team, Messi <b>has</b> <b>similarly</b> played anywhere along the frontline; under various managers, he has been employed on the right wing, as a false nine, or in a deeper, creative role as a classic number 10 or attacking midfielder.|$|E

25|$|The {{achievements}} of the Eighth Army in this last campaign are perhaps less well remembered than those during the Western Desert Campaign under Montgomery.

25|$|In {{a crystal}} {{structure}} the coordination geometry of an atom is the geometrical pattern of coordinating atoms where {{the definition of}} coordinating atoms depends on the bonding model used.

In metals with the body centred cubic (bcc) structure each atom has eight nearest neighbours in a cubic geometry. In metals with the face centred cubic (fcc) structure each atom has twelve nearest neighbours in a cuboctahedral geometry.|$|E
25|$|Harmonia axyridis (the {{harlequin}} ladybird) is {{an example}} of how an animal might be partly welcome and partly harmful. It was introduced into North America from Asia in 1916 to control aphids, but is now the most common species, outcompeting many of the native species. It has since spread to much of western Europe, reaching the UK in 2004. It has become something of a domestic and agricultural pest in some regions, and gives cause for ecological concern. It <b>has</b> <b>similarly</b> arrived in parts of Africa, where it has proved variously unwelcome, perhaps most prominently in vine-related crops.|$|E

25|$|By November 2006, {{the use of}} lindane {{had been}} banned in 52 {{countries}} and restricted in 33 others. Seventeen countries, including the US and Canada, allowed either limited agricultural or pharmaceutical use. In 2009, an international ban {{on the use of}} lindane in agriculture was implemented under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. A specific exemption allows for it to continue to be used in second-line treatments for the head lice and scabies for five more years. The production of the lindane isomers α- and β-hexachlorocyclohexane was also banned. Although the US has not ratified the Convention, it <b>has</b> <b>similarly</b> banned agricultural uses while still allowing its use a second-line lice and scabies treatment.|$|E
25|$|While it is {{difficult}} to determine which teachers had most influence on Rabbi Dessler, it is apparent that he is a child of the yeshiva world of the early 20th century, which was then influenced heavily by the ethical Mussar movement, but <b>has</b> <b>similarly</b> gained proficiency in Kabbalah and works of Hasidic Judaism and Jewish philosophy. His method in interpreting tenets of Jewish philosophy reveals an adherence to the principles of the Maharal (Rabbi Loeb of Prague, 16th century). Another major influence appears to have been the 19th century Hasidic work, Tanya. Rabbi Dessler did, however, maintain that it is acceptable to believe that the Zohar was not written by Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and that it had a late authorship.|$|E
