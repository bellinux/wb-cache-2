5|$|Broaching is {{used when}} {{precision}} machining is required, especially for odd shapes. Commonly machined surfaces include circular and non-circular holes, splines, keyways, and <b>flat</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Typical workpieces include small to medium-sized castings, forgings, screw machine parts, and stampings. Even though broaches can be expensive, broaching is usually favored over other processes when used for high-quantity production runs.|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that the shape of liquid drop on <b>flat</b> <b>surface</b> is {{dependent}} to several energy. One of these energy is surface energy. In this paper to attempt calculate the Free energy of liquid drop on the <b>flat</b> <b>surface</b> and then with extermomize of it, suggest a method for measure surface tension or contact liquid angle with <b>flat</b> <b>surface...</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{linear motion}} bearing or linear stage having {{kinematic}} determinacy uses two V-grooves sliding on a cylinder, a <b>flat</b> <b>surface</b> sliding {{on a second}} parallel cylinder, and a <b>flat</b> <b>surface</b> joining the screw.|$|R

5|$|The greater yellow-headed vulture {{feeds on}} carrion and locates {{carcasses}} by sight and by smell, an ability which {{is rare in}} birds. It is dependent on larger vultures, such as the king vulture, to open the hides of larger animal carcasses, as its bill is {{not strong enough to}} do this. Like other New World vultures, the greater yellow-headed vulture utilizes thermals to stay aloft with minimal effort. It lays its eggs on <b>flat</b> <b>surfaces,</b> such as the floors of caves, or in the hollows of stumps. It feeds its young by regurgitation.|$|E
5|$|Like its {{predecessors}} in the Tony Hawk's series, Underground {{is centered on}} skateboarding {{in a series of}} levels. The player performs tricks via combinations of analog stick and button inputs. For example, the player initiates an ollie (a jump trick) by holding and releasing the jump button. During an ollie, the player may change the position of the analog stick and press one of two buttons to perform either a flip trick (such as an impossible or kickflip) or a grab trick (such as a benihana or nosegrab). The player can grind on certain edges and rails; different tricks may be performed during a grind based on the position of the analog stick. On quarter pipes, the player may execute lip tricks. While skating on <b>flat</b> <b>surfaces,</b> the player may manual in multiple ways via button combinations. Miscellaneous tricks include acid drops and wall-rides.|$|E
5|$|For Invasion of the Vorticons, John Carmack and Romero focused {{exclusively}} on the programming, while Adrian Carmack joined late in development and had a personal art style that did not match with the game. As a result, the game was largely shaped by designer Tom Hall's personal experiences and interests. Keen's red sneakers and Green Bay Packers football helmet were items Hall wore as a child, dead enemies left behind corpses due to his belief that child players should be taught that death had permanent consequences, and enemies were based loosely on his reading of Sigmund Freud's psychological theories, {{such as that of}} the id. The team reprised their roles for both Keen Dreams and Goodbye, Galaxy, with the addition of programmer Jason Blochowiak for Goodbye, Galaxy, and changed the game engine and design for the next Keen games: an increase in graphical quality with parallax scrolling to make the background move at a different speed than the foreground, a pseudo-3D view rather than a side-on view, ramps rather than solely <b>flat</b> <b>surfaces,</b> support for sound cards, and changes to the design based on player feedback.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We exhibit several {{transformations of}} {{surfaces}} in R 4. First, one {{that takes a}} <b>flat</b> <b>surface</b> and gets a <b>surface</b> with <b>flat</b> normal bundle; then, one that takes a <b>surface</b> with <b>flat</b> normal bundle and gets a flat surface; finally, a one-parameter family of transformations on a <b>flat</b> <b>surface</b> with <b>flat</b> normal bundle and gives a <b>flat</b> <b>surface</b> with <b>flat</b> normal bundle. This family satisfies a permutability property. 1. ...|$|R
50|$|Soundbug transmits {{the audio}} {{signal to the}} <b>flat</b> <b>surface</b> {{by way of a}} small piece of Terfenol-D, which is a {{magnetostrictive}} alloy of rare earth metals and iron. This material, when stimulated with an electrical input, causes the Terfenol to expand slightly, resulting in sound output with a very small amplitude. Once attached to a <b>flat</b> <b>surface,</b> Soundbug will translate electric signals into mechanical energy, causing the <b>flat</b> <b>surface</b> to vibrate and broadcast the sound.|$|R
40|$|<b>Flat</b> <b>surface</b> {{detection}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common geometry inferences in computer vision. In this paper we propose detecting printed photos from original scenes, which fully exploit angular information of light field and characteristics of the <b>flat</b> <b>surface.</b> Unlike previous methods, our method does not need a prior depth estimation. The algorithm rectifies the mess epipolar lines in the epipolar plane image (EPI). Then feature points are extracted from light field data and used to compute an energy ratio in the depth distribution of the scene. Based on the energy ratio, a feature vector is constructed and we obtain robust detection of <b>flat</b> <b>surface.</b> Apart from <b>flat</b> <b>surface</b> detection, the kernel rectification algorithm in our method can be expanded to inclined plane refocusing and continuous depth estimation for <b>flat</b> <b>surface.</b> Experiments on the public datasets and our collections have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|R

The team reprised their roles for subsequent Keen games, with the addition of programmer Jason Blochowiak for Galaxy and Aliens, and changed the game engine and design for the next Keen games: an increase in graphical quality with parallax scrolling to make the background move at a different speed than the foreground, a pseudo-3D view rather than a side-on view, ramps rather than solely <b>flat</b> <b>surfaces,</b> support for sound cards, and changes to the design based on player feedback.|$|E
5|$|Ideas {{from the}} Deep, now founded as id Software, {{used some of}} these games to {{prototype}} ideas for their own games, including in late spring of 1991 Keen Dreams, which they used to develop new systems for their next set of major episodes of the series. They did not initially {{want to do a}} Keen game for Softdisk, but eventually decided that doing so would let them fulfill their obligations while also helping to improve the next full set of games for Apogee. The team reprised their roles from the first game, and prototyped an increase in graphical quality with parallax scrolling to make the background move at a different speed than the foreground, a pseudo-3D view rather than a side-on view, ramps rather than solely <b>flat</b> <b>surfaces,</b> support for sound cards, and changes to the design based on player feedback. The game's plot, as a result, was designed to be a standalone game outside of the continuity of the main series, and not a true sequel. Once the parallax scrolling and design changes were completed, Keen Dreams was completed {{in less than a month}} even as the team simultaneously worked on another game.|$|E
5|$|Lakes may form in basins {{where there}} is {{sufficient}} precipitation or meltwater from glaciers above. They are usually shallow and saline, and wind blowing over their surface can cause stress, moving the water over nearby low-lying areas. When the lakes dry up, they leave a crust or hardpan behind. This area of deposited clay, silt or sand {{is known as a}} playa. The deserts of North America have more than one hundred playas, many of them relics of Lake Bonneville which covered parts of Utah, Nevada and Idaho during the last ice age when the climate was colder and wetter. These include the Great Salt Lake, Utah Lake, Sevier Lake and many dry lake beds. The smooth <b>flat</b> <b>surfaces</b> of playas have been used for attempted vehicle speed records at Black Rock Desert and Bonneville Speedway and the United States Air Force uses Rogers Dry Lake in the Mojave Desert as runways for aircraft and the space shuttle.|$|E
50|$|Yantras {{can be on}} a <b>flat</b> <b>surface</b> {{or three}} dimensional. Yantras can be drawn or painted on paper, {{engraved}} on metal, or any <b>flat</b> <b>surface.</b> They tend to be smaller in size than the similar mandala, and traditionally use less color than mandalas.|$|R

5|$|The redback {{is mainly}} nocturnal; the female remains {{concealed}} during the day, and spins her web during the night, usually {{remaining in the}} same location {{for most of her}} adult life. Classified as a gum-footed tangle web, the web is an irregular-looking tangle of fine but strong silk. Although the threads seem random, they are strategically placed for support and entrapment of prey. The rear portion of the web forms a funnel-like retreat area where the spider and egg sacs are found. This area has vertical, sticky catching threads that run to ground attachments. The vertical strands act as trip wires to initially alert the spider to the presence of prey or threats. They also snare and haul prey into the air when weaker horizontal strands that hold them down, known as guy lines, break when prey thrash around. These webs are usually placed between two <b>flat</b> <b>surfaces,</b> one beneath the other. The female spends more time in the funnel and less time moving around during cooler weather.|$|E
5|$|Weapons {{range from}} pistols to shotguns, assault rifles, and sniper rifles. Although {{all of them}} have {{unlimited}} ammunition, they overheat if fired continuously for prolonged periods. In addition, the player can use grenades which latch onto targets or <b>flat</b> <b>surfaces</b> to be remotely detonated. Shepard and the squad members are protected by a health bar and damage-absorbing shields. The health bar only takes damage once the shields have been destroyed, but environmental hazards like heat or toxic agents may directly affect the health bar if they are not negated entirely by wearing appropriate armor. The health bar can be restored with the use of items called Medi-gels, while shields automatically regenerate when not taking fire for a brief period. Some talents and equipment items can improve the healing rate or shield regeneration. The player can revive fallen squad members {{with the use of the}} Unity talent. However, if Shepard dies, the player must start the game again from the last saved point.|$|E

30|$|The {{reflected}} acoustic {{waves on}} the top of the propagation channel, i.e. the water surface, depend, also, on many parameters such as the wind, the wave frequency as well as the swell properties[16]. For this reason, the water surface can’t be considered as a <b>flat</b> <b>surface.</b> Therefore, the direction of a reflected acoustic wave is dispersed in the space. However in average term, reflected acoustic waves can be considered as obtained by a <b>flat</b> <b>surface</b> with absorption coefficients[15]. In our model, a <b>flat</b> <b>surface</b> is considered and random coefficients are added to characterize other unknown parameters.|$|R

5|$|Pathan {{had another}} {{difficult}} {{start to the}} new year in 2006 on the Test tour to Pakistan. In the first two Test matches played on <b>flat</b> <b>surfaces</b> in Lahore and Faisalabad, he had little success against the Pakistani batsmen, taking a total of two wickets while conceding 319 runs at more than four runs an over. After not getting an opportunity in the First Test—India lost only one wicket—Pathan made use of the good batting conditions himself and scored 90 in a double century partnership with wicket-keeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni in Faisalabad. Pathan found success with {{the ball in the}} Third Test in Karachi, when on 29 January he became the first – and to date only – person to claim a hat-trick in the first over of a Test match. It was also the highest in terms of total averages of the batsmen dismissed (130.18: Salman Butt 34.27, Younis Khan 46.04, Mohammad Yousuf 49.86) and came after 1783 Tests in the history of cricket. He had Butt caught by Dravid in the slips from an outswinger, before trapping Younis leg before wicket and bowling Yousuf, both with inswingers. He finished with a haul of 5/61 after the hosts staged a lower-order counter-attack but was punished in the second innings, taking 1 wicket while conceding 106 runs as Pakistan set a target which was beyond India's reach. Pathan ended the series with 134 runs at 44.66 and took eight wickets at 60.75. Despite his Test travails, Pathan continued to perform strongly in the ODI arena, scoring 65 in the top order in the first ODI against Pakistan in Peshawar before making three consecutive three wicket hauls in the following matches. This included a man of the match performance that included a haul of 3 wickets for 43 runs at Rawalpindi as he claimed nine wickets at 18.88 at an economy rate of 4.49 for the series. Having taken an unassailable 3–1 lead, India rested Pathan for the final match.|$|E
