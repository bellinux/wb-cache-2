In culture and social life, both the Polish language and Catholicism became <b>dominant,</b> <b>and</b> in 1696, Polish replaced Belarusian as the official language—with the Belarusian language being banned from administrative use. However, the local Ruthenian peasants, continued to speak their own language and remained faithful to the Eastern Orthodox church.|$|E
5|$|Single cross hybrids {{result from}} the cross between two true-breeding organisms which {{produces}} an F1 hybrid (first filial generation). The cross between two different homozygous lines produces an F1 hybrid that is heterozygous; having two alleles, one contributed by each parent and typically one is <b>dominant</b> <b>and</b> the other recessive. Typically, the F1 generation is also phenotypically homogeneous, producing offspring that are all similar to each other.|$|E

Subordinate females lick the clitorises of higher-ranked females as a sign of submission and obedience, but females also lick each other's clitorises as a greeting or to strengthen social bonds; in contrast, while all males lick the clitorises of dominant females, the females will not lick the penises of males because males are considered to be of lowest rank.|$|E
5|$|From the 9th century, Nuskhuri script {{starting}} becoming <b>dominant,</b> <b>and</b> {{the role}} of Asomtavruli was reduced. However, epigraphic monuments of the 10th to 18th centuries continued to be written in Asomtavruli script. Asomtavruli in this later period became more decorative. In the majority of 9th-century Georgian manuscripts which were written in Nuskhuri script, Asomtavruli was used for titles and the first letters of chapters. Although, some manuscripts written completely in Asomtavruli can be found until the 11th century.|$|E
5|$|From {{the sixteenth}} century onwards Alfred's {{reputation}} became <b>dominant</b> <b>and</b> Æthelstan largely disappeared from popular consciousness. Sharon Turner's History of the Anglo-Saxons, first published between 1799 and 1805, {{played a crucial role}} in promoting Anglo-Saxon studies, and he helped to establish Brunanburh as a key battle in English history, but his treatment of Æthelstan was slight in comparison with Alfred. Charles Dickens had only one paragraph on Æthelstan in his Child's History of England, and although Anglo-Saxon history was a popular subject for nineteenth-century artists, and Alfred was frequently depicted in paintings at the Royal Academy between 1769 and 1904, there was not one picture of Æthelstan.|$|E

5|$|In the 19th century, a politico-economic {{discourse}} emerged. It concerned {{itself with}} distinguishing the phases in the organisation of human societies and correctly identifying {{the place of}} Greek slavery. The influence of Marx is decisive; for him the ancient society was characterized by development of private ownership and the <b>dominant</b> (<b>and</b> not secondary as in other pre-capitalist societies) character of slavery {{as a mode of}} production. The Positivists represented by the historian Eduard Meyer (Slavery in Antiquity, 1898) were soon to oppose the Marxist theory. According to him slavery was the foundation of Greek democracy. It was thus a legal and social phenomenon, and not economic.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1944 at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, McClintock began {{systematic}} studies on the mechanisms of the mosaic color patterns of maize seed and the unstable inheritance of this mosaicism. She identified two new <b>dominant</b> <b>and</b> interacting genetic loci that she named Dissociator (Ds) and Activator (Ac). She found that the Dissociator did not just dissociate or cause the chromosome to break, it also had a variety of effects on neighboring genes when the Activator was also present, which included making certain stable mutations unstable. In early 1948, she made the surprising discovery that both Dissociator and Activator could transpose, or change position, on the chromosome.|$|E

30|$|For tropical-type forests generally, {{such as the}} Knysna forests, Seydack (2000) {{identified}} three canopy layer occupation guilds: forest matrix occupants, canopy <b>dominants</b> <b>and</b> supra-canopy occupants (including emergents). Canopy <b>dominants</b> <b>and</b> supra-canopy species achieve their representation in the community by invading the forest matrix (forest matrix invaders). These matrix invading canopy species are often considered to be gap opportunists and are geared to occupy upper canopy positions. Physiologically, forest matrix occupants are persistence specialists (stress resistance) under the resource-responsive metabolic performance mode, underpinning persistance capacity and niche specialisation under tropical conditions (Seydack 2000; Seydack et al. 2011, 2012).|$|R
5|$|She {{identifies}} the UN as the book's villain and criticizes the UN's practise of moral equivalency that treats both sides equally even though {{one side is}} clearly <b>dominant</b> <b>and</b> brutally oppressive. It results in the requirement of its personnel to remain neutral but Off questions how a peacekeeper can remain neutral while watching people being killed. The book treats this as a reality of international relations, which places precedence on state sovereignty over human rights, and a factor in making the UN slow, ineffectual, and inappropriately bureaucratic. She notes that some peacekeepers cope by demonizing all sides which helps diminish the sense of impotence in being unable to intervene.|$|E

The breed takes well to training, and especially excels at training that offers some variety rather than routine training drills. However, members of the breed can may have issues with food possessiveness. They can be stubborn, and mentally are slow to mature from puppyhood. Some lines of the breed still retain <b>dominant</b> <b>and</b> aggressive temperaments; other than these lines, the AWS gets on well with children and enjoys playing with them. Even though they were originally bred to hunt, due to their size, they are suitable for apartment living as long as they receive enough exercise.|$|E
5|$|The bird family Emberizidae {{contains}} around 300 seed-eating species, {{the majority}} of which {{are found in the}} Americas, although the genus Emberiza, with more than forty members, is confined to the Old World.

40|$|Dominant-subordinate status {{emerges from}} agonistic encounters. The weakly {{electric}} fish, Gymnotus omarorum, displays a clear-cut example of non-breeding territorial aggression. The asymmetry {{in the behavior}} of <b>dominants</b> <b>and</b> subordinates is outstanding. Dominants are highly aggressive and subordinates signal submission in a precise sequence of locomotor and electric traits: retreating, decreasing their electric organ discharge rate, and emitting transient electric signals. The hypothalamic neuropeptide arginine-vasotocin (AVT) and its mammalian homolog arginine-vasopressin, are key modulators of social behavior, known to adapt their actions to different contexts. By analyzing the effects of pharmacological manipulations of the AVT system in both <b>dominants</b> <b>and</b> subordinates, we show evidence of distinct status-dependent actions of AVT. We demonstrate an endogenous effect of AVT on dominants' aggression levels: blocking the V 1 a AVT receptor induced a significant decrease in dominants' attack rate. AVT administered to subordinates enhanced the expression of the electric signals of submission, without affecting subordinates' locomotor displays. This study contributes a clear example of status-dependent AVT modulation of agonistic behavior in teleosts, and reveals distinctive activation patterns of the AVT system between <b>dominants</b> <b>and</b> subordinates...|$|R

5|$|After {{completing}} the game once, the player can access the Chrysler Building and {{have access to}} the final boss, who takes the form of Aya's sister, Maya. She explains to Aya that Klamp cultivated the liver cells of the original Eve to analyze. When Melissa was giving birth to the Ultimate Being, she created a nest there. In case Melissa and the Ultimate Being failed, the purebred would remain. Aya speaks with her sister, and they engage in battle against the purebred. After the purebred is defeated, the mitochondria inside Aya's body begin to rebel against her. It is explained that Aya's mitochondria have now reached a higher evolutionary stage than Maya’s, but Maya's personality has suddenly become <b>dominant</b> <b>and</b> begun to fight off the Eve persona. Maya eventually wins, purging the Eve persona from herself. Somehow, Maya protects Aya by preventing the original Eve from taking over her. Aya leaves the building by herself, although she apparently has gained some sort of connection with her dead sister.|$|E
5|$|All {{humans have}} {{two copies of}} the Huntingtin gene (HTT), which codes for the protein Huntingtin (HTT). The gene is also called HD and IT15, which stands for 'interesting {{transcript}} 15'. Part of this gene is a repeated section called a trinucleotide repeat, which varies in length between individuals and may change length between generations. If the repeat is present in a healthy gene, a dynamic mutation may increase the repeat count and result in a defective gene. When the length of this repeated section reaches a certain threshold, it produces an altered form of the protein, called mutant Huntingtin protein (mHTT). The differing functions of these proteins are the cause of pathological changes which in turn cause the disease symptoms. The Huntington's disease mutation is genetically <b>dominant</b> <b>and</b> almost fully penetrant: mutation of either of a person's HTT alleles causes the disease. It is not inherited according to sex, but {{the length of the}} repeated section of the gene and hence its severity can be influenced by the sex of the affected parent.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Quality {{of service}} (QOS) of a choreography is {{dependent}} on the quality of service of participating roles. Recently, a proposal has been made to extend the meta model of WSDL to include QOS parameters. These parameters include reliability, availability and demand. In this paper we propose a multidimensional model of quality of service of a choreography based on above proposed extensions. Our proposal describes the QOS of a choreography in terms of QOS of dominant role, <b>dominant</b> relationship <b>and</b> <b>dominant</b> interaction. <b>Dominant</b> role <b>and</b> <b>dominant</b> relationship are identified by analyzing relationships and interactions where as dominant interaction is based on dominant operation.

Further, we also proposed rules for estimation of QOS of <b>dominant</b> relationship <b>and</b> <b>dominant</b> interaction. We demonstrate our proposal through an example...|$|R

5|$|Alleles at a locus may be {{dominant}} or recessive; dominant alleles {{give rise}} to their corresponding phenotypes when paired with any other allele for the same trait, whereas recessive alleles {{give rise to}} their corresponding phenotype only when paired with another copy of the same allele. If you know the genotypes of the organisms, you can determine which alleles are <b>dominant</b> <b>and</b> which are recessive. For example, if the allele specifying tall stems in pea plants is dominant over the allele specifying short stems, then pea plants that inherit one tall allele from one parent and one short allele from the other parent will also have tall stems. Mendel's work demonstrated that alleles assort independently {{in the production of}} gametes, or germ cells, ensuring variation in the next generation. Although Mendelian inheritance remains a good model for many traits determined by single genes (including a number of well-known genetic disorders) it does not include the physical processes of DNA replication and cell division.|$|E
