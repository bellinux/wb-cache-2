5|$|M53 (NGC 5024) is a <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> {{which was}} {{discovered}} independently by Johann Elert Bode in 1775 and Charles Messier in February 1777; William Herschel {{was the first}} to resolve it into stars. The magnitude-7.7 cluster is 56,000 light-years from Earth. Only 1° away is NGC 5053, a <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> with a sparser nucleus of stars. Its total luminosity is the equivalent of about 16,000 suns, one of the lowest luminosities of any <b>globular</b> <b>cluster.</b> It was discovered by William Herschel in 1784. NGC 4147 is a somewhat dimmer <b>globular</b> <b>cluster,</b> with a much-smaller apparent size.|$|E
5|$|When {{the stars}} of a {{particular}} <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> are plotted on an HR diagram, in many cases {{nearly all of the}} stars fall upon a relatively well defined curve. This differs from the HR diagram of stars near the Sun, which lumps together stars of differing ages and origins. The shape of the curve for a <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> is characteristic of a grouping of stars that were formed at approximately the same time and from the same materials, differing only in their initial mass. As the position of each star in the HR diagram varies with age, the shape of the curve for a <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> can be used to measure the overall age of the star population.|$|E
5|$|As all {{the stars}} of a <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> are at {{approximately}} the same distance from us, their absolute magnitudes differ from their visual magnitude by about the same amount. The main-sequence stars in the <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> will fall along a line that {{is believed to be}} comparable to similar stars in the solar neighborhood. The accuracy of this assumption is confirmed by comparable results obtained by comparing the magnitudes of nearby short-period variables, such as RR Lyrae stars and cepheid variables, with those in the cluster.|$|E
40|$|<b>Globular</b> <b>clusters</b> are dense {{collections}} {{of hundreds of}} thousands of stars found around all bright galaxies. Being much brighter than individual stars, <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> can be studied at much greater distances. In my thesis I studied the chemical compositions of over a thousand <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> around thirteen galaxies. By measuring the ratio of hydrogen to heavy elements such calcium in the <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> and using these ratios to infer relative ages, I was able to study the formation history of these <b>globular</b> <b>clusters.</b> By understanding more about how <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> form, I was able to learn about how galaxies form...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decade we witness an advent of new types of dwarf stellar systems in cluding ultra-compact dwarfs, ultra-faint dwarf spheroidals, and exotic <b>globular</b> <b>clusters,</b> {{breaking}} the old simple paradigm for dwarf galaxies and <b>globular</b> <b>clusters.</b> These objects become more intriguing, and understanding of these new findings be comes more challenging. Recently we discovered {{a new type of}} large scale structure in the Virgo cluster of galaxies: it is composed of <b>globular</b> <b>clusters.</b> <b>Globular</b> <b>clusters</b> in Virgo are found wandering between galaxies (intracluster <b>globular</b> <b>clusters)</b> as well as in galaxies. These intracluster <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> fill a significant fraction {{in the area of the}} Virgo cluster and they are dominated by blue <b>globular</b> <b>clusters.</b> These intracluster <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> may be closely related with the first dwarf galaxies in the universe.

50|$|The {{observational}} {{data for}} dark <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> {{comes from the}} Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile which observed {{the vicinity of the}} galaxy Centaurus A. Many of the <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> inside that galaxy are brighter and more massive than those orbiting the Milky Way and a sample of 125 <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> around Centaurus A was studied using the VLT's FLAMES instrument. While <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> are normally considered to be almost devoid of dark matter, the study of the dynamical properties of sampled clusters suggested the presence of exotically concentrated dark matter. The study was published in The Astrophysical Journal(link). The existence of dark <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> would suggest that their formation and evolution are markedly different from other <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> in Centaurus A and the Local Group.|$|R
5|$|Discovered in 1995, the Pyxis <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> is a 13.3 ± 1.3 billion year-old <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> {{situated}} around 130,000 light-years {{distant from}} Earth and around 133,000 light-years {{distant from the}} centre of the Milky Way—a region not previously thought to contain globular clusters. Located in the galactic halo, it was noted to lie on the same plane as the Large Magellanic Cloud and the possibility has been raised that it might be an escaped object from that galaxy.|$|E
5|$|NGC 362 {{is another}} <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> in Tucana with an {{apparent}} magnitude of 6.4, 27,700 light-years from Earth. Like neighboring 47 Tucanae, NGC 362 is a Shapley class III cluster {{and among the}} brightest globular clusters in the sky. Unusually for a <b>globular</b> <b>cluster,</b> its orbit takes it {{very close to the}} center of the Milky Way—approximately 3,000 light-years. It was discovered in the 1820s by James Dunlop. Its stars become visible at 180x magnification through a telescope.|$|E
5|$|The {{telescope}} {{was involved in}} the discovery of millisecond pulsars, and also discovered the first pulsar in a <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> in 1986—a millisecond pulsar in the Messier 28 <b>globular</b> <b>cluster.</b> In September 2006, the results of three years of observing a double pulsar, PSR J0737-3039, with the Lovell telescope, {{as well as with the}} Parkes and Green Bank Telescopes, were announced— confirming that the general theory of relativity is accurate to 99.5%.|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of compact X-ray sources in <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> allows diagnostic studies {{of both the}} X-ray sources themselves and the <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> to be carried out. A review of much of this work, primarily based on Einstein X-ray observations and supporting studies of <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> at radio through UV wavelengths, is presented. The compact X-ray sources in <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> {{are found to be}} compact binaries containing neutron stars and - in a separate lower luminosity component of an apparently bimodal luminosity function - possibly white dwarfs. Implications for the formation and evolution of compact binary X-ray sources in <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> and in the galactic bulge are discussed. In particular, new evidence is presented that the galactic bulge sources may be compact binaries in the remnants of disrupted <b>globular</b> <b>clusters...</b>|$|R
5|$|Every {{galaxy of}} {{sufficient}} {{mass in the}} Local Group has an associated group of <b>globular</b> <b>clusters,</b> and almost every large galaxy surveyed {{has been found to}} possess a system of <b>globular</b> <b>clusters.</b> The Sagittarius Dwarf galaxy and the disputed Canis Major Dwarf galaxy appear to be in the process of donating their associated <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> (such as Palomar 12) to the Milky Way. This demonstrates how many of this galaxy's <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> might have been acquired in the past.|$|R
40|$|With the {{hypothesis}} that cosmic string loops act as seeds for <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> in mind, we study the role that velocities of these strings will play in determining the mass distribution of <b>globular</b> <b>clusters.</b> Loops with high enough velocities will not form compact and roughly spherical objects and can hence not be the seeds for <b>globular</b> <b>clusters.</b> We compute the expected number density and mass function of <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> {{as a function of}} both the string tension and the peak loop velocity, and compare the results with the observational data on the mass distribution of <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> in our Milky Way. We determine the critical peak string loop velocity above which the agreement between the string loop model for the origin of <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> (neglecting loop velocities) and observational data is lost.

5|$|Observations of {{globular}} clusters show that these stellar formations arise primarily in regions of efficient star formation, {{and where the}} interstellar medium is at a higher density than in normal star-forming regions. <b>Globular</b> <b>cluster</b> formation is prevalent in starburst regions and in interacting galaxies. Research indicates a correlation between the mass of a central supermassive black holes (SMBH) {{and the extent of}} the <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> systems of elliptical and lenticular galaxies. The mass of the SMBH in such a galaxy is often close to the combined mass of the galaxy's {{globular clusters}}.|$|E
5|$|The Milky Way covers {{much of the}} constellation's area. Of the {{deep-sky objects}} in Apus, there are two {{prominent}} globular clusters—NGC 6101 and IC 4499—and a large faint nebula that covers several degrees east of Beta and Gamma Apodis. NGC 6101 is a <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> of apparent magnitude 9.2 located around 50,000 light-years distant from Earth, which is around 160 light-years across. Around 13 billion years old, it contains {{a high concentration of}} massive bright stars known as blue stragglers, thought {{to be the result of}} two stars merging. IC 4499 is a loose <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> in the medium-far galactic halo; its apparent magnitude is 10.6.|$|E
5|$|The {{comparatively}} old <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> NGC 4833 near Delta Muscae was catalogued by Lacaille in 1755. It is 21,200light-years {{distant and}} somewhat obscured by dust clouds near the galactic plane. The <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> NGC 4372 near Gamma Muscae is fainter and likewise partially obscured by dust, but spans more arc minutes. It is 18,900light-years away from Earth and 23,000light-years {{distant from the}} centre of the Milky Way. Its extremely low metallicity indicates it is very old—one of the oldest clusters in the Milky Way. Extending south from it is the Dark Doodad Nebula, resembling a dark L-shaped river through a bright field of stars. Another dark nebula in the constellation is BHR 71.|$|E
5|$|<b>Globular</b> <b>clusters</b> {{are found}} in the halo of a galaxy and contain {{considerably}} more stars and are much older than the less dense open clusters, which {{are found in}} the disk of a galaxy. <b>Globular</b> <b>clusters</b> are fairly common; there are about 150 to 158 currently known <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> in the Milky Way, with perhaps 10 to 20 more still undiscovered. These <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> orbit the Galaxy at radii of 40 kiloparsecs (130,000 light-years) or more. Larger galaxies can have more: Andromeda Galaxy, for instance, may have as many as 500. Some giant elliptical galaxies (particularly those at the centers of galaxy clusters) such as M87, have as many as 13,000 <b>globular</b> <b>clusters.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Globular</b> <b>clusters</b> are spherical shaped objects which {{consist of}} a dense {{distribution}} of thousands of stars and which orbit the centers of galaxies. Unlike {{the stars in the}} disk of a galaxy, <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> are found in the halos around galaxies. The MilkyWay hosts approximately 200 <b>globular</b> <b>clusters,</b> from which ! Centauri is the brigthest and largest. It is commonly believed that most <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> {{consist of a}} single generation of stars, which are mostly very old and have low metallicity (these stars are called population II stars) ...|$|R
40|$|We report {{moderate}} resolution, high signal-to-noise spectroscopy of <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> around NGC 1399, {{the central}} cD galaxy in the Fornax cluster. We address issues {{as diverse as}} element abundances of <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> versus stellar populations in ellipticals, blue horizontal branches in metal-rich <b>globular</b> <b>clusters,</b> broad-band colors as metallicity tracers, possible overestimation of the age-metallicity degeneracy in <b>globular</b> <b>clusters,</b> and dark matter in the halo of NGC 1399. ( [...] .) The derived element abundances for the <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> span the entire range observed in the Milky Way and M 31, with a mean metallicity of our sample around [Fe/H] ~ - 0. 8 dex. This implies that the two major sub-populations reported from photometry could have formed by the same processes as the ones that formed halo and disk/bulge <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> in the Local Group spirals. Two <b>globular</b> <b>clusters</b> (that we associate {{with a group of}} very red <b>globular</b> <b>clusters,</b> representing about 5 % of the total system) clearly stand out and exhibit metal abundances as high as observed for stellar populations in giant ellipticals. In addition, they display surprisingly high Hbeta and Hgamma indices that are not explained by any age/metallicity combination of existing models. The high Mg and Hbeta values in these clusters could, however, be explained by the presence of blue horizontal branches. ( [...] . ...|$|R
5|$|The {{first known}} <b>globular</b> <b>cluster,</b> now called M22, was {{discovered}} in 1665 by Abraham Ihle, a German amateur astronomer. However, given the small aperture of early telescopes, individual stars within a <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> were not resolved until Charles Messier observed M4 in 1764. The first eight globular clusters discovered are shown in the table. Subsequently, Abbé Lacaille would list NGC 104, NGC 4833, M55, M69, and NGC 6397 in his 1751–52 catalogue. The M before a number refers to Charles Messier's catalogue, while NGC is from the New General Catalogue by John Dreyer.|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} N-body {{simulations}} {{have shown that}} the stars can follow unusual paths through the cluster, often forming loops and often falling more directly toward the core than would a single star orbiting a central mass. In addition, due to interactions with other stars that result in an increase in velocity, some of the stars gain sufficient energy to escape the cluster. Over long periods of time this will result in a dissipation of the cluster, a process termed evaporation. The typical time scale for the evaporation of a <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> is 1010 years. In 2010 it became possible to directly compute, star by star, N-body simulations of a <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> over the course of its lifetime.|$|E
5|$|The typical {{distance}} between {{stars in a}} <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> is about 1 light year, but at its core, the separation {{is comparable to the}} size of the Solar System (100 to 1000 times closer than stars near the Solar System).|$|E

5|$|In 2000, {{the results}} of a search for giant planets in the <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> 47 Tucanae were announced. The lack of any {{successful}} discoveries suggests that the abundance of elements (other than hydrogen or helium) necessary to build these planets may need to be at least 40% of the abundance in the Sun. Terrestrial planets are built from heavier elements such as silicon, iron and magnesium. The very low abundance of these elements in globular clusters means that the member stars have a far lower likelihood of hosting Earth-mass planets, when compared to stars in the neighborhood of the Sun. Hence the halo region of the Milky Way galaxy, including <b>globular</b> <b>cluster</b> members, are unlikely to host habitable terrestrial planets.|$|E
