SNB was performed after radiocolloid and blue dye injection. Pre-operative LSG and the intra-operative use of a gamma probe identified radioactive sentinel nodes, and visualization of blue stained lymphatics identified blue sentinel nodes. 104 sentinel nodes were harvested from 43 patients. The identification rate was 90 % (43 of 48). Of the 104 nodes harvested, 17 of 62 (27 %) nodes identified as both radioactive and blue were positive for occult metastases compared with 5 of 42 (12 %) nodes identified as hot or blue only (p< 0. 05). Sentinel nodes were identified in 39 of 48 (81 %) patients using LSG. Of 39 patients in whom sentinel nodes were identified using LSG, 37 of 39 (95 %) had radioactive sentinel nodes harvested intra-operatively. In patients who had no sentinel nodes identified on LSG, 4 of 9 (44 %) had radioactive sentinel nodes harvested intra-operatively.

Rarely, patients with melanoma have an underlying lymphoproliferative disease, and melanoma metastases might develop as collision tumours in the sentinel lymph node (SLN). The {{aim of this study}} was to measure the incidence and examine the effect of collision tumours on the accuracy of SLND and on the validity of staging in this setting. Between 1998 and 2012, 750 consecutive SLNDs were performed in melanoma patients using the triple technique (lymphoscintigraphy, <b>gamma</b> probe and <b>blue</b> dye). The validity of SLND in collision tumours was analysed. False negativity was reflected by the disease-free survival. The literature was reviewed on collision tumours in melanoma. Collision tumours of melanoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) were found in two SLN and in one RLND (0. 4 %). Subsequent RLNDs of SLND-positive cases were negative for melanoma. The patient with negative SLND developed relapse after 28 months with an inguinal lymph node metastasis of melanoma; RLND showed collision tumours. The literature review identified 12 cases of collision tumours. CLL was associated with increased melanoma incidence and reduced overall survival. This is, to our knowledge, the first assessment of the clinical value of SLND when collision tumours of melanoma and CLL are found. In this small series of three patients with both malignancies present in the same lymph node basin, lymphocytic infiltration of the CLL did not alter radioisotope uptake into the SLN. No false-negative result was observed. Our data suggest the validity of SLND in collision tumours, but given the rarity of the problem, further studies are necessary to confirm this reliability...|$|R
40|$|Background: Lymphoscintigraphy and {{sentinel}} node biopsy {{are currently}} being assessed {{as an alternative to}} axillary dissection for staging in early breast cancer. However, {{little is known about the}} optimum timing of surgery following injection of the radio­isotope into the breast. The aim of the present study was to establish whether lymphoscintigraphy on the morning of surgery allowed efficacious and accurate sentinel node identification and biopsy. Methods: We reviewed our experience of 216 consecutive cases of lymphoscintigraphy in early breast cancer using peritumoural injections of technetium 99 m antimony sulphide colloid and subsequent sentinel node biopsy using a hand-held <b>gamma</b> probe and <b>blue</b> dye. The time interval between radioisotope injection and successful intraoperative identification of the sentinel node was assessed and whether this was associated with certain clinical and histological variables. Results: The sentinel node was identified by lymphoscintigraphy in 160 cases (74 %) at a median time duration of 40 min post injection. The median time duration between isotope injection and surgery was 5 h. Of the 160 cases where the sentinel node was visualized at lymphoscintigraphy, sentinel node biopsy was successfully performed in 155 cases (97 %). This compares with 25 / 56 (45 %) cases where lymphoscintigraphy failed to localize the sentinel node (P < 0. 0001). There was no association found between the injection of the radioisotope greater or less than 5 h before surgery and the successful intraoperative identification of the sentinel node. Failure to identify the sentinel node at lymphoscintigraphy beyond 3 h was associated with a low intraoperative identification rate. There was no correlation found between intraoperative identification of the sentinel node according to the duration of isotope injection in relation to surgery and the various clinical and histological factors assessed. Conclusions: In our experience, the chance of identifying the sentinel node at the time of surgery does not increase with longer isotope injection duration using technetium 99 m antimony sulphide colloid. As soon as a sentinel node is identified at lymphoscintig­raphy, one can proceed to surgery. Scanning beyond 3 h does not appear to be effective in sentinel node localization. Given that the median time for successful lymphoscintigraphic mapping was only 40 min, lymphoscintigraphy can easily be completed during the morning to allow surgery to take place the same day.

50|$|The episode {{opens with}} Batman and Green Arrow {{fighting}} Clock King {{and his two}} henchmen after breaking out of a clockwork death trap that will lower them into acid. The main plot starts after the theme song airs. Teenage Jaime Reyes has become the second Blue Beetle but is not convinced that he has {{what it takes to}} be a superhero, partially because he has a few problems with controlling his powers. Batman decides to take the young superhero under his wing and asks Blue Beetle to help him stop a meteor and he remembers that he tried to rescue a cat from a tree. The mission is stopped, however, when the two superheroes to get sucked into a wormhole which sends both of them to a distant planet that has a war between single-celled aliens called Gibbles and the intergalactic pirate Kanjar Ro, who wants to harvest their bodies for fuel. The aliens believe that Blue Beetle is their savior, mistaking him for the previous one who wore the scarab, who was later killed. They think Batman is Blue Beetle's sidekick, but he is not confident he can save them, although he decides to try when he sees how much hope they have for him. Batman tells the Blue Beetle to give a speech to the aliens to encourage them to fight Kanjor Ro. Kanjor Ro is meanwhile draining energy from the Gibbles to power his ships for raids on the Medra Quadrant. However, the Gibble army attacks and Blue Beetle starts getting the hang of controlling the suit. He saves Batman from Kanjar Ro, then defeats him. However, when they have apparently defeated Ro, he frees his crew and uses the <b>Gamma</b> Gong on <b>Blue</b> Beetle, which he knows he has a weakness for; it eliminates his powers, and was how he killed the last Blue Beetle. Another blow of the Gong strips the armor away; when Ro sees his greatest foe is a child, he realizes he did eliminate the Beetle the last time they fought. He ties Batman and some Gibbles to a satellite for fish-like space monsters to eat, but Batman plugs a cable into the Gibble next to him, charging its power and electrocuting one of the monsters and scaring the other monsters away. Meanwhile, Ro has tied up the Beetle and is trying to use the Gong to find the right frequency to remove the Scarab. As Batman enters and knocks Ro into the Gong, the scarab is removed by the created tones. Ro then attaches it to his spine and uses its power to fight Batman. Meanwhile, Jaime thinks creatively and is able to escape his bonds, and then uses the Gong to strip away the armor and remove the Scarab from Ro. Enraged, he tries to attack them, but the Gibble uses a weapon that utilizes its own power to knock Ro out. Before he and Blue Beetle leave, the Gibbles thank Batman for his part in helping Blue Beetle and themselves to defeat Kanjor Ro. The two return to Earth through the wormhole, and find that it has brought them back to the exact time after they went through the wormhole the first time. This gives them enough time to finish the mission to stop the meteor that got them sent through the wormhole in the first place, and after making sure his partner is ready, Batman and Blue Beetle take on the meteor.|$|R
40|$|Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB) {{has become}} the {{standard}} procedure to assess {{the status of the}} lymphatic drainage in early stages of breast cancer. Currently, SLNB has replaced Complete Axillary Dissection (CAD) when the lymph nodes are clinically negative. The detection of a Sentinel Lymph Node (SLN) is critical for the success of SLNB procedure, but the accurate contribution of various clinical and pathological factors to the detection of SLNs has remained a controversial issue. This study, which is based on the database of a randomised controlled surgical trial of Sentinel Node biopsy versus Axillary Clearance (SNAC), is aimed at delineating the factors that can influence the outcomes of the SLNB and determining the clinical and pathological issues can predict the pathological outcomes of both SLNs and Non Sentinel Lymph Nodes (NSLN). Furthermore, a comparison of the ability of Cambridge nomogram, Stanford nomogram and Tenon score to predict the status of non sentinel lymph nodes was performed. Method: Retrospective analysis was made of all patient data involved in the SNAC trial in 2006 : 1088 patients were randomised into two groups: 544 patients allocated to the first group underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by CAD; the second group 544 patients underwent SLNB followed by CAD if positive SLNs were identified. A combination of three techniques including preoperative lymphoscintigraphy (LSG), intraoperative blue dye injection and gamma probe in the operation theatre were used for mapping of the SLNs. Retrieved nodes were examined via Haematoxylin and Eosin and immunohistochemistry. Results: SLNs were identified in 1024 (94. 6 %) patients involved in the SNAC trial. Our analysis revealed that the highest Identification Rate (IR) was achieved by using the combination of three detection techniques: SLNs were detected in 96. 3 % (905 out of 940). The identification rates of preoperative LSG, intraoperative <b>gamma</b> probe and <b>blue</b> dye were 81. 4 %, 91. 8 % and 83 % respectively. Patients‘ weights and the mode of primary tumour presentation {{have a significant impact on}} the overall outcomes of the sentinel lymph node detection. There were variations in the outcomes of multivariate analysis of factors influencing the detection of SLNs for each technique. The False Negative Rate (FNR), which was calculated only for patients who had SLNB followed by immediate CAD, was 8. 3 % and no significant correlation was found between various clinicopathological factors and the FNR. The involved SLNs were detected in 291 (28. 4 %) patients and involved non sentinel lymph nodes were identified in 118 out of 291 patients with positive SLNs. Regarding the prediction of the SLN status, the multivariate analysis models demonstrated that the size of the primary tumour (p = 0. 000), the presence of Peritumoural Vascular Invasion (PVI) (p = 0. 000), the primary tumour palpability (p = 0. 036) and the site of the primary tumour (p = 0. 038) were the most significant factors to predict the histopathological status of SLNs. The primary tumour size (p= 0. 015) and the diameter of the metastatic lesion (p= 0. 009) are the most significant predictors of the non sentinel lymph node status. Our validation of three nomograms to predict the positivity of NSLN revealed that the areas under the Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were 0. 697, 0. 714 and 0. 724 for Cambridge nomogram, Stanford nomogram and Tenon score respectively. Conclusion: the combined technique is superior to the single technique for SLN detection. The appropriate selection of patients to undergo SLNB procedure can minimise the failure of the sentinel lymph node detection. The presence of involved SLNs can be predicted from the primary tumour characteristics. The diameter of the primary tumour and the size of the metastatic lesion are independent predictors of NSLN involvement. Thesis (M. S.) [...] University of Adelaide, School of Medicine, 201...|$|R
40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. Clusters of transition element cations in neighboring sites frequently govern the optical properties of minerals. This {{is particularly true}} of Fe-bearing minerals which may exhibit several types of ion-pair transitions. In this thesis four different types of interactions were distinguished: intensified spin-forbidden transitions of Fe 3 + clusters, intensified Fe 2 + spin-allowed transitions of Fe 2 +-Fe 3 + clusters, heteronuclear charge transfer transitions of Fe 2 +-Ti 4 + and Mn 2 +-Ti 4 + clusters, and homonuclear charge transfer transitions of Fe 2 +-Fe 3 + clusters. The optical characteristics of Fe 3 + in red Fe 3 + rich and black Fe 3 +,Fe 2 +-rich tourmalines were examined by absorption spectroscopy in the visible and near-infrared, Mossbauer spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibility measurements. Intense optical absorption features at 485 and 540 nm were assigned to transitions of exchange-couple Fe 3 + pairs in two different site combinations. Absorption spectra at variable temperatures and of samples which were oxidized and reduced were used to establish these assignments. Site assignments were based on intensity ratios in different polarizations according to the polarization of these transitions along the vector between the interacting cations. The 485 nm band occurs at an unusually low energy for Fe 3 + in silicate minerals. Similar behavior was observed in the spectrum of coalingite, a Mg, Fe-hydroxy carbonate, and has been proposed to result from magnetic exchange in large, edge-shared octahedra. The antiferromagnetic exchange which is generally associated with intensity increases in Fe 3 + clusters was confirmed by variable temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements. The Mossbauer spectrum of a red tourmaline with 3. 4 % Fe exhibits an unusual decrease in width of peaks by ~ 30 % from 298 K to 5 K which {{may be related to}} an unusual interaction between Fe 3 + and trace amounts of Fe 2 +. Optical absorption and Mossbauer studies of Fe 2 +-bearing tourmalines with variable Fe 3 + contents were used to examine Fe 2 + transitions which are intensified through an interaction with Fe 3 + neighbors. The variation of molar absorptivity of Fe 2 + bands with the fraction of Fe 2 + in Fe 2 +-Fe 3 + pairs indicates that Fe 3 + ions increase the absorptivity of Fe 2 + bands to ~ 1200 [ [...] . ] as compared to ~ 5 [ [...] . ] for non-interacting Fe 2 +. Approximately equal degrees of intensification were observed for both components of the [ [...] . ] transition as well as for Fe 2 + in two different sites. Although the detailed behavior of non-interacting Fe 2 + ions differ in Mg-tourmalines and Li,Al-tourmalines, the characteristics of Fe 2 +-Fe 3 + absorption are constant. Intensity increases were restricted to the polarization which coincided with the vector between the Fe 2 + and Fe 3 + ions. The intensified Fe 2 + transitions are characterized by an unusual temperature response. The integrated intensity of these transitions increases by 10 - 50 % at 83 K as compared to 296 K. The positions and widths of the intensified transitions maintain the values of the non-interacting Fe 2 +. Tourmalines with the lowest Fe 3 + contents were the gemmy Li,Al-tourmalines which generally form in pockets within pegmatites. Fe,Mg-tourmalines exhibited consistently higher Fe 3 + contents than any of the Li-bearing tourmalines examined. Oxidation of Fe 2 + which resulted from <b>gamma</b> irradiation of <b>blue</b> Li-tourmalines which contained several percent each of Mn 0 and Fe 0 could be monitored by increases in Fe 2 + intensity in one polarization. Fe 2 +-Ti 4 + charge transfer transitions were examined in minerals which contain stoichiometric quantities of Fe and Ti [...] taramellite, neptunite, and traskite [...] and tourmaline. The wavelength of these transitions ranged between 400 and 500 nm, and the halfwidths ranged between 7000 and 9000 [ [...] . ]. These characteristics can generally be used to assign Fe 2 +-Ti 4 + charge transfer transitions. The molar absorpitivities of these transitions, however, exhibit very large variations. The molar absorptivity of Fe 2 +-Ti 4 + charge transfer in neptunite is ~ 225 [ [...] . ] in beta polarization, in taramellite it is ~ 1300 [ [...] . ] and in tourmaline it is ~ 4000 [ [...] . ]. Tentative assignments of Fe 2 +-Ti 4 + in more dilute minerals generally compare favorably with the energy and width stated above. However, sapphire and other Al-minerals such as kyanite have very different characteristics for bands assigned to Fe 2 +-Ti 4 + charge transfer. The Fe 2 +-Ti 4 + charge transfer transition in taramellite exhibits no change in integrated intensity with decreasing temperature but increases by 15 % from 296 K to 83 K in tourmaline. Mn 2 +-Ti 4 + charge transfer was also assigned to a transition at 320 nm in two unusual yellow tourmalines. The characteristics of Fe 2 +-Fe 3 + charge transfer transitions were reviewed in light of recent data and with regard to their utility as diagnostic criteria. A correlation between charge transfer energy and the separation of the interacting cations proposed by Smith and Strens (1976) could not be supported by the expanded data base. Temperature variations of charge transfer transition areas were also examined. The magnetic behavior of two minerals which exhibited different temperature responses were investigated. General agreement with the theories of Cox (1980) and Girered (1983) that suggest that ferromagnetic exchange should produce intensity increases at low temperature and that antiferromagnetic exchange produces intensity decreases was confirmed by these examples of Fe 2 +-Fe 3 + charge transfer but could not explain the temperature response of Fe 2 +-Ti 4 + charge transfer transitions. In any case, an increase in intensity with decreasing temperature, which is generally expected on the basis of experimental observations, cannot be used in a negative sense to eliminate a charge transfer assignment. The large width of charge transfer transitions is generally the most useful diagnostic criterion...|$|R
40|$|O câncer de mama (CA de mama), com exceção do câncer de pele do tipo não melanoma, é o tumor de maior incidência dentre as mulheres, sendo que no Brasil são encontrados {{principal}}mente nas regiões Sul e Sudeste. Seu principal tratamento é o cirúrgico. A disseminação do tumor pode ocorrer por via linfática, acometendo linfonodos regionais. A biópsia do linfonodo sentinela (BLNS) é um procedimento altamente relevante, é altamente sensível na identificação de metástases. A técnica de linfocintilografia (LINCT) pré-operatória é essencial, pois permite avaliar a cadeia linfática acometida e possibilita a visualização do linfonodo sentinela (LNS) durante a cirurgia. O objetivo é descrever os padrões de drenagem linfática e avaliar a contribuição da LCINT na localização dos LNS em pacientes com CA de mama. No período de março de 2009 a agosto de 2011 foram estudados 70 casos sequenciais da rotina clínica, submetidos ao tratamento cirúrgico do CA de mama com estudo do LNS através da técnica de LCINT. Na LCINT foram aplicadas 4 injeções intradérmicas contendo 37 MBq (1, 0 mCi) do FITATO-Tecnécio 99 m, ao redor da aréola mamária. Após a localização do LNS foi realizado marcações na pele, nas incidências anterior, oblíqua e lateral, para auxiliar o cirurgião na abordagem cirúrgica ulterior, juntamente com a sonda gama intra-operatória e corante azul patente. Dos 70 casos submetidos ao estudo, todos são do sexo feminino (100 %) com faixa etária entre 28 e 77 anos, média de 54 anos. O tamanho médio do tumor encontrado nos pacientes foi de 1, 4 cm. Os tipos histológicos mais incidentes foram o carcinoma ductal invasivo com 45 (64, 4 %) pacientes, seguido de carcinoma ductal in situ com 16 (22, 8 %). No exame de LCINT, todos os pacientes apresentaram drenagem linfática do radiofármaco a partir do {{local da}} injeção. Em 43 (61. 5 %) pacientes, observamos drenagem para 1 LNS, em 21 (30 %) para 2 LNS/LNNS (linfonodo não sentinela), em 5 (7 %) para 3 LNS/LNNS e em 1 (1. 5 %) para 4 LNS/LNNS. Dos 70 pacientes, 68 (97 %) apresentaram drenagem linfática ipsilateral e 2 (3 %) apresentaram drenagem linfática bilateral. Em relação aos territórios de drenagem linfática dos LNS/LNNS, em 68 (97 %) pacientes apresentaram drenagem para a região axilar, 1 (1, 5 %) para a região mamária interna e 1 (1, 5 %) para as regiões axilar e mamária interna. Os LNS/LNNS presentes na cadeia mamária interna não foram retirados. No intra-operatório, os cirurgiões utilizaram o corante azul patente em 35 (50 %) pacientes, destes o corante identificou os LNS/LNNS em 79 % dos casos. A técnica de LCINT possibilitou a visualização de todos os LNS e em alguns casos não foi possível a visualização do LNNS, o qual foi localizado e retirado com a sonda gama. Com isso, a técnica de LCINT foi eficaz em 88, 5 % dos casos. Dos 69 pacientes submetidos à BLNS apenas 13 (18, 8 %) pacientes apresentaram LNS/LNNS metastáticos, sendo estes submetidos à linfadenectomia axilar. Conclui-se que o exame pré-operatório de LCINT foi muito eficiente para o estudo da drenagem linfática, visualizando os canais linfáticos, linfonodos funcionalmente ativos e seus respectivos territórios de drenagem. Por tanto, esta técnica auxiliou o cirurgião na abordagem cirúrgica juntamente com a sonda gama intra-operatória e corante azul patente para a realização da BLNS. With {{the exception of}} non-melanoma skin cancer, the Breast cancer (breast CA) is the most incident cancer in women. In Brazil, the breast CA is more often found in South and Southeast regions. The main treatment of breast CA is the surgery. The main pathway for the tumor spreading is the lymphatic system, which may affect the regional lymph nodes. The sentinel node biopsy (SLNB) is of considerable importance, once it has a high sensitivity in identifying metastases. The technique of preoperative lymphoscintigraphy (LINCT) is essential because it allows evaluating the lymphatic drainage chain and enables the visualization of sentinel lymph node (SLN) during surgery. We aim here to describe the lymphatic drainage patterns and to evaluate the contribution of LCINT {{to the location of}} SLN in patients with breast CA. We evaluated 70 patients sequentially selected from the clinical routine, between march 2009 and august 2011, and that underwent the surgical treatment for breast CA, including the usage of the technique of LCINT for the SLN location. The LCINT were performed by the injection of four periareolar intradermal injections containing 37 MBq (1. 0 mCi) of the radiopharmaceutical PHYTATE- 99 m-Technetium. Based on the LCINT images, we performed skin marks in the dermal projections of the SLN in all anterior/posterior, oblique and lateral views. Additionally, the <b>gamma</b> probe and <b>blue</b> dye were used to help surgeons in the surgical location of the SLN. All of the 70 patients of our study were female, ranging from 28 to 77 years, mean 54 years. The average tumor size was 1. 4 cm. The most commonly found histological types were invasive ductal carcinoma (45 patients, 64. 4 %), followed by the in situ ductal carcinoma (16 patients, 22. 8 %). All LCINT procedures were well succeeded in demonstrating at least one SLN in our sample of patients. We observed lymphatic drainage for only one SLN in 43 patients (61. 5 %), for 2 SLN/SLNN in 21 (30 %) (non sentinel lymph node), for 3 SLN/SLNN in 5 (7 %) and for 4 SLN/SLNN in one patient (1. 5 %). From the 70 patients, 68 (97 %) exhibited ipsilateral and 2 (3 %) exhibited bilateral lymphatic drainage. Concerning the lymphatic territories, 68 patients (97 %) exhibited drainage to SLN/SLNN in the axillary region, 1 patient (1. 5 %) in the internal mammary region and another patient (1. 5 %) in both axillary and internal mammary regions. The two SLN/SLNN found in the internal mammary chain were not removed. Complimentary to the LCINT, the surgeons used blue dye in 35 patients (50 %), which enabled them to identify the SLN/SLNN in 79 % of cases. On the other hand, LCINT allowed the visualization of all SLN (100 %). In some cases, in which was not possible to visualize the SLNN, these ones were found by the use of the gamma probe. Thus, the LCINT technique was effective to localize the SLN in 88. 5 % of cases.
