5|$|Divergent {{evolution}} of active site residues is slow, due to strong chemical constraints. Nevertheless, some protease superfamilies have evolved from one nucleophile to another. This {{can be inferred}} when a superfamily (with the same fold) contains <b>families</b> <b>that</b> use different nucleophiles. Such nucleophile switches have occurred several times during evolutionary history, however the mechanisms by which this happen are still unclear.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine (DA, a {{contraction}} of 3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine) is an organic chemical of the catecholamine and phenethylamine <b>families</b> <b>that</b> plays several {{important roles in}} the brain and body. It is an amine synthesized by removing a carboxyl group from a molecule of its precursor chemical L-DOPA, which is synthesized {{in the brain and}} kidneys.

5|$|Beetle-pollinated {{flowers are}} usually large, greenish or off-white in color, and heavily scented. Scents may be spicy, fruity, or similar to {{decaying}} organic material. Beetles {{were most likely}} the first insects to pollinate flowers. Most beetle-pollinated flowers are flattened or dish-shaped, with pollen easily accessible, although they may include traps to keep the beetle longer. The plants' ovaries are usually well protected from the biting mouthparts of their pollinators. The beetle <b>families</b> <b>that</b> habitually pollinate flowers are the Buprestidae, Cantharidae, Carambycidae, Cleridae, Dermestidae, Lycidae, Melyridae, Mordellidae, Nitidulidae and Scarabeidae. Beetles may be particularly important {{in some parts of}} the world such as semiarid areas of southern Africa and southern California and the montane grasslands of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa.|$|E
5|$|In 1905, Beth Israel {{purchased}} {{the home of}} New Orleans' former mayor Joseph A. Shakspeare at 1610 Carondelet Street. Funds for the new acquisition came from both the Orthodox and Reform communities of New Orleans. After remodeling the building, the congregation began holding services there, {{in time for the}} 1906 High Holy Days. Membership grew quickly; by 1910 Beth Israel was the second-largest Jewish congregation in the city, with 180 member families, and by 1914 that number had grown to 250 families. By 1918, however, membership had fallen to 175 <b>families.</b> <b>That</b> year the synagogue's income was $6,000 (today $).|$|E
50|$|Bartosz Paprocki {{gives an}} example of the Rościszewski family taking {{different}} surnames from the names of various patrimonies or estates they owned. The branch of the Rościszewski <b>family</b> <b>that</b> settled in Chrapunia became the Chrapunski family, the branch of the Rościszewski <b>family</b> <b>that</b> settled in Strykwina became the Strykwinski family, and the branch of the Rościszewski <b>family</b> <b>that</b> settled in Borkow became known as the Borkowski family. Each family shared a common ancestor and belonged to the same knights' clan, so they bore the same coat of arms as the Rościszewski family.|$|R

Third coat of arms from the left is of Krall <b>family</b> <b>that</b> received nobility in 1768 followed by the coat of arms of the Szyszko <b>family</b> <b>that</b> should be not mixed up with ancient Szyszkowski de Szyszki family. The coat of arms of the Turkuł <b>family</b> <b>that</b> received nobility in 1676, this family is extinct. The last two coats of arms in third row are of Wysocki and Zawadzki families. Both families have never been considered {{as members of the}} Clan of Ostoja but also here their coat of arms become recognized as variant of the Ostoja coat of arms. In the case of Wysocki family belong to the Clan of Kolumna with a modified coat of arms called Kolumna ze skrzydlami - Kolumna with wings.|$|R
5|$|In 1980, Applewhite and Nettles {{had about}} 80followers, {{many of whom}} held jobs, often working with {{computers}} or as car mechanics. In 1982, Applewhite and Nettles allowed their disciples to call their families. They further relaxed their control in 1983, permitting their followers to visit relatives on Mother's Day. They were only allowed short stays and were instructed to tell their <b>families</b> <b>that</b> they were studying computers at a monastery. These vacations were intended to placate families by demonstrating that the disciples remained with the group of their own accord.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of Katrina 50 <b>families</b> <b>that</b> were members of Beth Israel left New Orleans, and gave up {{membership}} in the congregation. These included Rabbi Schiff and his family. After the flood Beth Israel's board of directors informed Schiff, who had joined they synagogue in April 2002, {{that it would not}} be able to meet its contractual obligations and pay him past December. Schiff and his family had also lost their home and much of their possessions, and had been living in Memphis. Schiff resigned effective November 1, 2005, citing this loss, and the lack of a functioning Jewish Day School in the area for his children.|$|E
5|$|It {{was finally}} {{accepted}} by BBC North in 1986, {{a result of}} a spare budget being assigned for a second series of Happy <b>Families</b> <b>that</b> would never arise, and producer Paul Jackson's insistence that Red Dwarf should be filmed instead. The show was lucky to be remounted after an electricians' strike partway through rehearsals in early 1987 shut the entire production down (the title sequence was filmed in January 1987). The filming was rescheduled for September, and the pilot episode finally made it onto television screens on 15 February 1988.|$|E

5|$|Most farming {{was based}} on the lowland fermtoun or Highland baile, {{settlements}} of a handful of <b>families</b> <b>that</b> jointly farmed an area notionally suitable for two or three plough teams, allocated in run rigs to tenant farmers. They usually ran downhill so that they included both wet and dry land, helping to offset some of the problems of extreme weather conditions. Most ploughing was done with a heavy wooden plough with an iron coulter, pulled by oxen, which were more effective in heavy soils and cheaper to feed than horses. Obligations to the local lord usually included supplying oxen for ploughing the lord's land on an annual basis and the much resented obligation to grind corn at the lord's mill.|$|E
5|$|On April 21, 1981, four EPB commandos {{were able}} to extract $348,000 from a Wells Fargo armored car, with the group later noting {{that it would be}} spent in their cause. In November 1981, the EPB detonated {{explosives}} in AEE substations in Santurce, a district of San Juan. When 350 <b>families</b> <b>that</b> occupied a makeshift village in Carolina, Puerto Rico, were removed by the police, the EPB warned the governor that they would retaliate. Afterwards, they made an offensive against the police that resulted in twelve injured and one dead policeman.|$|E
5|$|The Danubian {{emperors}} {{ruled the}} empire {{for over a}} century, until 379. Indeed, until 363, power was held by descendants {{of one of the}} original Junta members. Constantine I' s father, Constantius Chlorus, was a Caesar (deputy emperor) in Diocletian's Tetrarchy. Constantine's grandson Julian ruled until 363. These emperors restored the army to its former strength and effectiveness, but were solely concerned with the needs and interests of the military. They were also divorced from the wealthy Roman senatorial <b>families</b> <b>that</b> dominated the Senate and owned much of the empire's land. This in turn bred a feeling of alienation from the army among the Roman aristocracy which in the later 4th century began to resist the military's exorbitant demands for recruits and supplies.|$|E

5|$|With few exceptions, these roads {{remained}} rudimentary {{and were}} impassible {{in bad weather}} and a nuisance in good weather, which limited the economic possibilities of those regions of Delaware and Maryland. The Good Roads Movement in the 1890s and 1900s spurred investment and advocacy for constructing all-weather roads that connected the population centers of the states, although the instigating forces in each state were different. State agencies in Maryland spearheaded the tasks of studying the issues and recommending increasingly effective courses of action. In Delaware, it was the philanthropic measure of a worldly man of one of Delaware's leading <b>families</b> <b>that</b> brought good roads {{to much of the}} state.|$|E
5|$|Bartolomé de las Casas {{was born}} in Seville in 1484, on 11 November. For centuries, Las Casas's birthdate was {{believed}} to be 1474; however, in the 1970s, scholars conducting archival work demonstrated this to be an error, after uncovering in the Archivo General de Indias records of a contemporary lawsuit that demonstrated he was born a decade later than had been supposed. Subsequent biographers and authors have generally accepted and reflected this revision. His father, Pedro de las Casas, a merchant, descended from one of the <b>families</b> <b>that</b> had migrated from France to found the town of Seville; his family also spelled the name Casaus. According to one biographer, his family were of converso heritage, although others refer to them as ancient Christians who migrated from France. Following the testimony of Las Casas's biographer Antonio de Remesal, tradition has it that Las Casas studied a licentiate at Salamanca, but this is never mentioned in Las Casas's own writings. As a young man, in 1507, he journeyed to Rome where he observed the Festival of Flutes.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1st century, a {{distinct}} equestrian group, non-Italian and military in character, became established. This {{was a result}} of the established custom whereby the emperor elevated the primuspilus (chief centurion) of each legion to equestrian rank on completion of his year in office. This resulted in some 30 career soldiers, mostly non-Italian and risen from the ranks, joining the aristocracy each year. Far less wealthy than their Italian counterparts, many such equites belonged to <b>families</b> <b>that</b> provided career soldiers for generations. Prominent among them were Romanised Illyrians, the descendants of the Illyrian-speaking tribes that inhabited the Roman provinces of Pannonia (W Hungary/Croatia/Slovenia), Dalmatia (Croatia/Bosnia) and Moesia Superior (Serbia), together with the neighbouring Thracians of Moesia Inferior (N Bulgaria) and Macedonia provinces. From the time of Domitian (ruled 81–96), when over half the Roman army was deployed in the Danubian regions, the Illyrian and Thracian provinces became the most important recruiting ground of the auxilia and later the legions.|$|E
