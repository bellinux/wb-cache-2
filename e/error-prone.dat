5|$|Cells cannot {{function}} if DNA damage corrupts {{the integrity}} and accessibility of essential information in the genome (but cells remain superficially functional when non-essential genes are missing or damaged). Depending {{on the type of}} damage inflicted on the DNA's double helical structure, a variety of repair strategies have evolved to restore lost information. If possible, cells use the unmodified complementary strand of the DNA or the sister chromatid as a template to recover the original information. Without access to a template, cells use an <b>error-prone</b> recovery mechanism known as translesion synthesis as a last resort.|$|E
5|$|Tallon missed {{selection}} {{during the}} 195152 season due his increasingly <b>error-prone</b> glovework and {{a combination of}} health reasons including stomach ulcers and deafness. He did not play a first-class match {{because of lack of}} his fitness. In any case, Tallon had secretly been barred from selection by the Australian Board of Control for making unauthorised comments in the media; this fact was not revealed for half a century.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{sequence}} {{data from}} genomic and metagenomic projects are essentially the same, but genomic sequence data offers higher coverage while metagenomic data is usually highly non-redundant. Furthermore, {{the increased use}} of second-generation sequencing technologies with short read lengths means that much of future metagenomic data will be <b>error-prone.</b> Taken in combination, these factors make the assembly of metagenomic sequence reads into genomes difficult and unreliable. Misassemblies are caused by the presence of repetitive DNA sequences that make assembly especially difficult because of the difference in the relative abundance of species present in the sample. Misassemblies can also involve the combination of sequences from more than one species into chimeric contigs.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} viral capsid enters the cell, an enzyme called reverse {{transcriptase}} liberates the single-stranded (+)RNA genome from the attached viral proteins and copies {{it into a}} complementary DNA (cDNA) molecule. The process of reverse transcription is extremely <b>error-prone,</b> and the resulting mutations may cause drug resistance or allow the virus to evade the body's immune system. The reverse transcriptase also has ribonuclease activity that degrades the viral RNA during the synthesis of cDNA, as well as DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity that creates a sense DNA from the antisense cDNA. Together, the cDNA and its complement form a double-stranded viral DNA that is then transported into the cell nucleus. The integration of the viral DNA into the host cell's genome is carried out by another viral enzyme called integrase.|$|E
5|$|In Escherichia coli, SOS {{boxes are}} 20-nucleotide long {{sequences}} near promoters with palindromic structure {{and a high}} degree of sequence conservation. In other classes and phyla, the sequence of SOS boxes varies considerably, with different length and composition, but it is always highly conserved and one of the strongest short signals in the genome. The high information content of SOS boxes permits differential binding of LexA to different promoters and allows for timing of the SOS response. The lesion repair genes are induced at the beginning of SOS response. The <b>error-prone</b> translesion polymerases, for example, UmuCD'2 (also called DNA polymerase V), are induced later on as a last resort. Once the DNA damage is repaired or bypassed using polymerases or through recombination, the amount of single-stranded DNA in cells is decreased, lowering the amounts of RecA filaments decreases cleavage activity of LexA homodimer, which then binds to the SOS boxes near promoters and restores normal gene expression.|$|E
5|$|Kemble {{recognised}} the antiquity of Spelman's {{document and}} used historical texts (such as Bede's Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum) to assess its date of origin. He proposed locations for each tribe, without attempting to locate each one, {{and suggested that}} some Anglo-Saxon peoples were missing from the document. Birch, in his paper An Unpublished Manuscript of some Early Territorial Names in England, announced his discovery of {{what became known as}} Recension A, which he suggested was a 10th or 11th century copy of a lost 7th-century manuscript. He methodically compared all the publications and manuscripts of the Tribal Hidage that are available at the time and placed each tribe using both his own theories and the ideas of others, some of which (for instance when he located the Wokensætna in Woking, Surrey) are now discounted. Maitland suspected that the accepted number of acres to each hide needed to be reconsidered to account for the figures in the Tribal Hidage and used his own calculations to conclude that the figures were probably exaggerated. John Brownbill advised against using Latin versions of the document, which he described as <b>error-prone.</b> He determined that the Old English manuscript was written in 1032 and was a copy of an original Mercian manuscript. Chadwick attempted to allocate each tribe to one or more English shires, with the use of key passages from historical texts.|$|E
25|$|Four {{classes of}} {{mutations}} are (1) spontaneous mutations (molecular decay), (2) mutations due to <b>error-prone</b> replication bypass of naturally occurring DNA damage (also called <b>error-prone</b> translesion synthesis), (3) errors introduced during DNA repair, and (4) induced mutations caused by mutagens. Scientists may also deliberately introduce mutant sequences through DNA manipulation {{for the sake}} of scientific experimentation.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} reverse {{transcription}} is extremely <b>error-prone,</b> {{and it is}} during this step that mutations may occur. Such mutations may cause drug resistance.|$|E
25|$|Patients with TSA {{typically}} exhibit paraphasia; {{their speech}} is fluent but often <b>error-prone.</b> Their speech is often unintelligible as {{they tend to}} use the wrong words, e.g. tree instead of train or uses words in senseless and incorrect combinations.|$|E
25|$|Although {{documentation}} can {{be maintained}} entirely in a vendor-specific presentation format such as WinHelp, it is more often the case that documentation must be published in multiple presentation formats at once: Microsoft Compiled HTML Help (CHM), WinHelp, HTML pages, Java Help, PDF, etc. It would be very expensive and <b>error-prone</b> to maintain each format separately.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{damage is}} {{considered}} to be the primary underlying cause of cancer. If DNA repair is deficient, damage can accumulate. Such damage can cause mutational errors during DNA replication due to <b>error-prone</b> translesion synthesis. Accumulated damage can also cause epigenetic alterations due to errors during DNA repair. Such mutations and epigenetic alterations can give rise to cancer (see malignant neoplasms).|$|E
25|$|Auditing {{of results}} helps to compare {{formulae}} and optimisation strategies amongst each other. Due to considerable {{confusion in the}} past, a clear set of guidelines now exists to report IOL power related data. There are six key measures {{that are to be}} reported. In recognition of the fact that comparison of ideal IOL powers is likely to be <b>error-prone,</b> all comparisons are done for actual or predicted refractive errors.|$|E
25|$|In {{light of}} these issues, it may seem that HPIV is too {{complicated}} and <b>error-prone</b> {{to be used for}} flow measurements. However, many impressive results have been obtained with all holographic approaches. Svizher and Cohen used a hybrid HPIV system to study the physics of hairpin vortices. Tao et al. investigated the alignment of vorticity and strain rate tensors in high Reynolds number turbulence. As a final example, Sheng et al. used holographic microscopy to perform near-wall measurements of turbulent shear stress and velocity in turbulent boundary layers.|$|E
25|$|There is {{increasing}} {{evidence that the}} majority of spontaneously arising mutations are due to <b>error-prone</b> replication (translesion synthesis) past DNA damage in the template strand. Naturally occurring oxidative DNA damages arise at least 10,000 times per cell per day in humans and 50,000 times or more per cell per day in rats. In mice, the majority of mutations are caused by translesion synthesis. Likewise, in yeast, Kunz et al. found that more than 60% of the spontaneous single base pair substitutions and deletions were caused by translesion synthesis.|$|E
25|$|Assembly {{languages}} eliminate {{much of the}} <b>error-prone,</b> tedious, {{and time-consuming}} first-generation programming needed with the earliest computers, freeing programmers from tedium such as remembering numeric codes and calculating addresses. They were once widely used {{for all sorts of}} programming. However, by the 1980s (1990s on microcomputers), their use had largely been supplanted by higher-level languages, in the search for improved programming productivity. Today assembly language is still used for direct hardware manipulation, access to specialized processor instructions, or to address critical performance issues. Typical uses are device drivers, low-level embedded systems, and real-time systems.|$|E
25|$|Humanised {{antibodies}} {{are produced}} by grafting murine hypervariable regions on amino acid domains into human antibodies. This results in a molecule of approximately 95% human origin. Humanised antibodies bind antigen much more weakly than the parent murine monoclonal antibody, with reported decreases in affinity of up to several hundredfold. Increases in antibody-antigen binding strength have been achieved by introducing mutations into the complementarity determining regions (CDR), using techniques such as chain-shuffling, randomization of complementarity-determining regions and antibodies with mutations within the variable regions induced by <b>error-prone</b> PCR, E. coli mutator strains and site-specific mutagenesis.|$|E
25|$|Federer {{began his}} ATP World Tour {{season at the}} Qatar Open, where he was {{defending}} his title. After straight-set victories over 2011 finalist Nikolay Davydenko and qualifier Grega Žemlja, Federer won a hard-fought, <b>error-prone</b> match over eighth-seeded Andreas Seppi. Federer was scheduled to play Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in a rematch of the previous year's semifinal, but was forced to withdraw due to a back spasm problem. This marked {{only the second time}} in Federer's career (after the 2008 Paris Masters) that he withdrew from a tournament because of injury.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{commands}} available in command line interfaces can be many, complex operations {{can be performed}} using a short sequence of words and symbols. This allows greater efficiency and productivity once many commands are learned, but reaching this level takes some time because the command words may not be easily discoverable or mnemonic. Also, using the command line can become slow and <b>error-prone</b> when users must enter long commands comprising many parameters or several different filenames at once. However, windows, icons, menus, pointer (WIMP) interfaces present users with many widgets that represent and can trigger some of the system's available commands.|$|E
25|$|While {{some might}} say that Nakamichi {{violated}} the tape recording standards to achieve the highest dynamics possible, producing non-compatible cassettes for playback on other machines, {{the reasons for this}} are more complex than they appear on the surface. Different interpretations of the cassette standard resulted in a 4dB ambiguity at 16kHz. Technically, both camps in this debate were still within the original cassette specification as no tolerance for frequency response was provided above 12.5kHz and all calibration tones above 12.5kHz are considered optional. But also Nakamichi is not <b>error-prone.</b> Decreasing noise at 16kHz also decreases the maximum signal level at 16kHz, the HighFrequency-Dynamics stay almost constant.|$|E
25|$|One {{particular}} {{weakness of}} this method with OpenSSL is that it always limits encryption and authentication security of the transmitted TLS session ticket to AES128-CBC-SHA256, no matter what other TLS parameters were negotiated for the actual TLS session. This means that the state information (the TLS session ticket) is not as well protected as the TLS session itself. Of particular concern is OpenSSL's storage of the keys in an application-wide context (SSL_CTX), i.e. {{for the life of}} the application, and not allowing for re-keying of the AES128-CBC-SHA256 TLS session tickets without resetting the application-wide OpenSSL context (which is uncommon, <b>error-prone</b> and often requires manual administrative intervention).|$|E
25|$|A similar {{method of}} obtaining new deoxyribozymes is through in vitro {{evolution}}. Though this term is often used interchangeably with in vitro selection, in vitro evolution more appropriately refers to a slightly different procedure in which the initial oligonucleotide pool is genetically altered over subsequent rounds through genetic recombination or through point mutations. For point mutations, the pool can be amplified using <b>error-prone</b> PCR to produce many different strands of various random, single mutations. As with in vitro selection, the evolved strands with increased activity will tend to dominate the pool after multiple selection steps, and once a sufficient catalytic activity is reached, the pool can be sequenced to identify the most active strands.|$|E
25|$|The job of {{designing}} and printing the new stamp {{was carried out}} in a great rush; engraving began only on May 4, and stamp printing on May 10 (a Friday), in sheets of 100 (contrary to the usual practice of printing 400 at a time and cutting into 100-stamp panes). Since the stamp was printed in two colors, each sheet had to be placed into the flat-bed printing press twice, an <b>error-prone</b> process that had resulted in invert errors in stamps of 1869 and 1901, and at least three misprinted sheets were found during the production process and destroyed. It is believed that only one misprinted sheet of 100 stamps got through unnoticed, and stamp collectors have spent the ensuing years trying to find them all.|$|E
25|$|The Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP), {{based in}} {{suburban}} Philadelphia, {{is a nonprofit}} organization devoted to preventing medication errors and the safe use of medications. Its medication error prevention efforts began in 1975 with a column in Hospital Pharmacy to inform healthcare professionals and others about medication error prevention. ISMP operates a voluntary practitioner error-reporting program to tabulate errors nationally, understand their causes, and share “lessons learned” with the healthcare community, known as the Medication Errors Reporting Program (MERP), operated by the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) in cooperation with ISMP. In addition, ISMP’s corporate subsidiary, Med-E.R.R.S. (Medical Error Recognition and Revision Strategies), works directly and confidentially with the pharmaceutical industry to prevent errors that stem from confusing or misleading naming, labeling, packaging, and device design. The ISMP list of <b>error-prone</b> abbreviations is distributed nationally.|$|E
500|$|Information channels: Information-theoretic {{approaches}} {{model the}} process of translating the genetic code into corresponding amino acids as an <b>error-prone</b> information channel. The inherent noise (that is, the error) in the channel poses the organism with a fundamental question: how can a genetic code be constructed to withstand noise while accurately and efficiently translating information? These [...] "rate-distortion" [...] models suggest that the genetic code originated {{as a result of}} the interplay of the three conflicting evolutionary forces: the needs for diverse amino acids, for error-tolerance and for minimal resource cost. The code emerges at a transition when the mapping of codons to amino acids becomes nonrandom. The code's emergence is governed by the topology defined by the probable errors and is related to the map coloring problem.|$|E
500|$|Certain {{variations}} of the BRCA2 gene increase risks for breast cancer {{as part of a}} hereditary breast-ovarian cancer syndrome. Researchers have identified hundreds of mutations in the BRCA2 gene, many of which cause an increased risk of cancer. BRCA2 mutations are usually insertions or deletions of a small number of DNA base pairs in the gene. As a result of these mutations, the protein product of the BRCA2 gene is abnormal and does not function properly. Researchers believe that the defective BRCA2 protein is unable to fix DNA damages that occur throughout the genome. [...] As a result, there is an increase in mutations due to <b>error-prone</b> translesion synthesis past un-repaired DNA damages, and some of these mutations can cause cells to divide in an uncontrolled way and form a tumor.|$|E
500|$|The Buccaneers scored 10 {{points and}} {{recovered}} two fumbles, {{all in the}} last four minutes, to pass the Lions and maintain their two-game division lead over the Chicago Bears. This was the Buccaneers' sixth come-from-behind win of the season and they finished with a 4-0 road record against division opponents. After Neil O'Donoghue's fourth-quarter field goal, Dewey Selmon forced a Detroit fumble that was recovered by Dana Nafziger at the Lions' 23-yard line. Doug Williams followed this with a 23-yard touchdown pass to Larry Mucker. Mucker, who earlier had been fined for missing the team bus to the stadium, beat close coverage from Walt Williams to make the catch. The Buccaneers' <b>error-prone</b> play, of which McKay said [...] "we didn't play with very much intelligence", required a late comeback to defeat the 1–10 Lions.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{notoriously}} <b>error-prone</b> {{behaviors of}} earlier C-family languages have been changed: ...|$|E
2500|$|Immature thymocytes each make {{distinct}} T-cell receptors by {{a process}} of gene rearrangement. [...] This process is <b>error-prone,</b> and some thymocytes fail to make functional T-cell receptors, whereas other thymocytes make T-cell receptors that are autoreactive.|$|E
2500|$|Geoffrey W. Hoffmann {{has shown}} that an early <b>error-prone</b> {{translation}} machinery can be stable against an error catastrophe of the type that had been envisaged as problematical for the origin of life, and was known as [...] "Orgel's paradox".|$|E
2500|$|The genomes of RNA viruses {{are based}} on RNA rather than DNA. The RNA viral genome can be double {{stranded}} (as in DNA) or single stranded. In some of these viruses (such as the single stranded human immunodeficiency virus) replication occurs quickly {{and there are no}} mechanisms to check the genome for accuracy. [...] This <b>error-prone</b> process often results in mutations.|$|E
2500|$|Advocates of {{the idea}} argue {{that it will be}} easier for parents and {{employers}} to block the entire TLD, rather than using more complex and <b>error-prone</b> content-based filtering, without imposing any restrictions on those who wish to access it. Editors of explicit content sites, however, were afraid that the use of a single TLD like [...]xxx would also make it easier for search engines to block all of their content.|$|E
2500|$|Enumerating all {{possible}} {{states is a}} lengthy and potentially <b>error-prone</b> process. [...] For macromolecular complexes that can adopt multiple states, enumerating each state quickly becomes tedious, if not impossible. [...] Moreover, {{the addition of a}} single additional modification or feature to the model of the complex under investigation will double the number of possible states (if the modification is binary), and it will more than double the number of transitions that need to be specified.|$|E
2500|$|Nucleotide {{sequence}} context influences mutation probability {{and analysis}} of mutational (mutable) DNA motifs can be essential for understanding the mechanisms of mutagenesis in cancer. Such motifs represent the fingerprints of interactions between DNA and mutagens, between DNA and repair/replication/modification enzymes. [...] Examples of motifs are the AID motif WRCY/RGYW (W = A or T, R = purine and Y = pyrimidine) with C to T/G/A mutations, and <b>error-prone</b> DNA pol η attributed AID-related mutations (A to G/C/G) in WA/TW motifs.|$|E
2500|$|One recent {{advance in}} the use of meganucleases for genome {{engineering}} is the incorporation of the DNA binding domain from transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors into hybrid nucleases. [...] These [...] "megaTALs" [...] combine the ease of engineering and high DNA binding specificity of a TAL effector with the high cleavage efficiency of meganucleases. [...] In addition, meganucleases have been fused to DNA end-processing enzymes in order to promote <b>error-prone</b> non-homologous end joining and to increase the frequency of mutagenic events at a given locus.|$|E
2500|$|Scientific {{notation}} also enables simpler order-of-magnitude comparisons. A proton's mass is [...] If {{written as}} , {{it is easier}} to compare this mass with that of an electron, given below. [...] The order of magnitude of the ratio of the masses can be obtained by comparing the exponents instead of the more <b>error-prone</b> task of counting the leading zeros. [...] In this case, −27 is larger than −31 and therefore the proton is roughly four orders of magnitude ( [...] times) more massive than the electron.|$|E
2500|$|The team {{originally}} considered using C++, but {{rejected it}} for several reasons. Because they were developing an embedded system with limited resources, {{they decided that}} C++ needed too much memory and that its complexity led to developer errors. [...] The language's lack of garbage collection meant that programmers had to manually manage system memory, a challenging and <b>error-prone</b> task. The team also worried about the C++ language's lack of portable facilities for security, distributed programming, and threading. Finally, they wanted a platform that would port easily to all types of devices.|$|E
