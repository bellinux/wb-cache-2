The thickness and size of the plica mediana can vary between species, and except in treeshrews, it is cartilaginous and provides support for the sublingua.|$|E
5|$|MN610 was {{originally}} planned to extend west to I-94 in Maple Grove, and the freeway's mile markers reflected these plans, with {{the zero point}} calibrated to this future terminus. A portion of this section is very unusual; it is routed <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the median of CR81 in Maple Grove, forming a roadway within a roadway.|$|E
5|$|Shevchenko, who {{had scored}} the decisive penalty against Juventus' Gianluigi Buffon in 2003, {{then had to}} score or Liverpool would win. He hit his penalty {{straight}} <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the goal. Dudek went down to his right, but blocked the shot with his left hand. Liverpool thus won the penalty shootout by a score of 3–2.|$|E

5|$|In 1494, the {{principal}} maritime powers, Portugal and Spain, signed a treaty which drew a line <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the Atlantic Ocean and allocated all trade routes {{to the east}} of the line to Portugal. That gave Portugal dominance of the only known route to the east—via the Cape of Good Hope and Indian Ocean, which left Spain, and later other countries, to seek a western route to the Pacific. The exploration of the south began as part of the search for such a route.|$|E
5|$|A frog's skin is protective, has a {{respiratory}} function, {{can absorb}} water and helps control body temperature. It has many glands, {{particularly on the}} head and back, which often exude distasteful and toxic substances (granular glands). The secretion is often sticky and helps keep the skin moist, protects against the entry of moulds and bacteria, and make the animal slippery and more able to escape from predators. The skin is shed every few weeks. It usually splits <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the back and across the belly, and the frog pulls its arms and legs free. The sloughed skin is then worked towards the head where it is quickly eaten.|$|E
5|$|Croneman {{claims to}} be the mightiest barbarian of the {{northern}} tribes and honorary chief of the savage bezerkers of Nid. Known also as Amoron, the Wombat, he is a slayer, a reaver, a corsair, a usurper, and a conqueror. Depicted as resembling Schwarzenegger, he is also a bodybuilder with a very silly accent. On first meeting Croneman, Thrud slices him in half with a sword. When Croneman returns to join a group of mercenaries fighting The Black Currant in Thrud the Destroyer, he is depicted with a line of sutures running <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> his face and chest.|$|E

5|$|In 1950 the Dade County Planning Board {{announced}} {{a plan to}} build a highway connecting Key Biscayne with the Overseas Highway on Key Largo. The project envisioned bridges connecting artificial islands, to be built on the Safety Valve and existing small keys to Elliott Key and on to Key Largo. Áleman was expected to donate the right-of-way for a road running <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the island to the first bridge at Cape Florida. With the prospect of a major highway passing through his property, Áleman rushed to prepare it for development: he had it completely cleared, leveled and filled in. A seawall was constructed along the western (Biscayne Bay) side of the Cape Florida property.|$|E
5|$|It differs in {{appearance}} from the similar {{lesser yellow-headed vulture}} in several ways. It {{is larger than the}} lesser yellow-headed vulture, with a longer, broader tail. The plumage is a dark, glossy black in contrast to the lesser yellow-headed vulture's browner plumage. Its legs are darker in color and its head is more yellow and less orange/pink than that of the lesser yellow-headed vulture. Its wings are broader and its flight is also steadier. Unlike {{the other members of the}} genus Cathartes, the greater yellow-headed vulture has relatively dark inner primaries, which contrast slightly with the paler secondaries and outer primaries. The greater yellow-headed vulture prefers to live in forests while the lesser yellow-headed vulture prefers to inhabit savannas, and it is more heavily built than the lesser yellow-headed vulture. The greater yellow-headed vulture is also somewhat larger than the turkey vulture. It can be distinguished from that species only at relatively close range by the differing head coloration. The underwing coloration is similar to the turkey vulture but the greater yellow-headed usually has a faint but broad and dark band vertically <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the wings.|$|E
5|$|One of Mickal's {{most notable}} games came in 1934 against the Mustangs of Southern Methodist. He threw two {{touchdown}} passes, {{the first one}} a 32-yarder {{to tie the game}} at 7–7 in the second quarter. Late in the fourth quarter and down by a touchdown, Mickal dropped back at his own 35-yard line and hurled a pass <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the field. It was caught in stride at the Mustang 20-yard line by Gaynell Tinsley, who ran it into the end zone to tie the game at 14–14, which was the final score. In week four against 13th-ranked Arkansas, Mickal completed five of seven passes for 117 yards, which included a 52-yard bomb in the third quarter for the first score of the 16–0 win. He also averaged over 50 yards per punt on nine punts. The next week he threw a touchdown pass, kicked a field goal, and averaged over 40 yards per punt in a 29–0 win over previously undefeated Vanderbilt. Mickal was named a first-team All-SEC selection as a fullback by the Associated Press (AP) and as a halfback by the UP.|$|E

5|$|When {{plans for}} Runcorn New Town were drawn up, they {{included}} three distinct types of road: local roads, expressways and the Busway. The expressways {{are intended to}} keep all through traffic off the local roads. This system links to the north by the A533 over the Silver Jubilee Bridge to Widnes and Merseyside, to the northeast to Warrington by the A56, to the east to Northwich and north Cheshire by the A533, and to the southeast by the A557 to the M56 and to Frodsham. The M56 links to the M6 and, {{to the north of}} Widnes, the A557 links to the M62. The Busway is a system of roads for use by buses only, and bears no resemblance to guided busways or bus lanes in use elsewhere, as it is a totally separate road system, not running alongside (or <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of)</b> existing roads. In addition, there is a network of dedicated cycleways in the town.|$|E
