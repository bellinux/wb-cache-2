This disease was caused by methyl mercury from Kanose Factory of Showa Denko which produced acetaldehyde as its main product in terms of limestone based chemical technology. Discharged methyl mercury was stored and condensed in plankton, aquatic insects and fish of the river and was eaten by many people and made Niigata Minamata Disease patients. Some of them presented a case to Niigata District Court in 1967 and won the case in 1971. Niigata Minamata Disease has scarcely been of research topics in social science areas in spite of many studies in chemical and medical areas. This article may be a challenge in this tendency. Two research steps are taken in this research: one step is physical accounting approach for historical examination of Niigata Minamata Disease and its patients and the other step is external environmental accounting approach about disclosure of compensation in annual reports.

40|$|In recent years, {{people have}} begun to {{appreciate}} that we, as humans, have been rather careless with how our activities impact other life forms on a global level. Biodiversity has become a catch phrase to encompass and encourage conservation efforts. The term biodiversity is composed of two different words, bios and diversity, which translates into {{the definition of a}} difference or variety of life. It refers the large variety of life forms that comprise and make up the entire biosphere of our planet. For the many years that humans have existed, we have coexisted with a variety of other species. Species have come and gone; humans did not drive the dinosaurs to extinction. But within the last 300 hundred years, a small amount of time when considered against total history, there has been an <b>extraordinary</b> <b>loss</b> of species to extinction. Much of this loss of life is due to our lack of knowledge and understanding of the interdependence of all species. Each species which becomes extinct weakens the links in our entire life support system. We {{need to be aware of}} the consequences of our actions. In recent years, we have been impressed with new scientific and genetic knowledge about the machinery of life. It is a large and complex subject, but it also one which needs to have top priority. With our reflection upon the interdependence of the human species with all other species, and our increasing awareness of the accelerating environmental crisis threatening the earth's natural ecosystems and animal populations, the priority becomes much more evident. Biodiversity is a complex subject to deal with, but we can deal with it on a smaller scale while making a large scale impact; enough small steps do make a difference. Zoological parks (zoos) have become central in advancing science, technology as the roles of zoos gradually evolves; these areas are essential to preserving the earth's natural ecological diversity. The most important impact of zoos lies in their educational programs. The implementation of broad-based and far-reaching educational agendas that successfully communicate the importance of biodiversity and the severity of the extinction crisis is undoubtedly necessary, and indeed crucial. Zoological parks are changing their roles from the idea of the animal collections and menageries of the past to vital centers emphasizing the importance of education for conservation. These parks and conservation centers are among the best alternatives to educate the public in preserving the earth's natural diversity and bounty. The move is away from exhibiting species to educating about the majestic panorama of nature. College of Architecture and PlanningThesis (B. Arch. ...|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 79 - 82). xii, 82 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmPacific threadfin (Polydactylus sexftlis), {{known locally}} by its Polynesian name "moi", is rapidly becoming a premier aquaculture species in Hawai'i {{and throughout the}} Indo-Pacific. Nevertheless, threadfin culture is suffering from <b>extraordinary</b> <b>loss</b> of seed stock during the pre-metamorphic and metamorphic periods, and from dramatic size variation among animals after metamorphosis that leads to cannibalism. The objectives of my studies were to: 1) determine the relationship, if any, between diet of threadfin broodstock and thyroid hormone content of fertilized eggs; 2) {{examine the effects of}} potassium iodide (KI) supplementation to broodstock rearing tanks on thyroid hormone concentrations in fertilized eggs; and 3) examine effects of iodide concentration of rearing tanks on larval growth, survival, metamorphosis, and whole body concentrations of thyroid hormones and cortisol. Broodstock fed a diet rich in iodine produced fertilized eggs with significantly higher thyroxine (T 4) and triiodothyronine (T 3) levels than eggs produced by broodstock fed either a raw diet of squid, lake smelt and shrimp, or a commercial marine broodstock feed. Fertilized eggs from broodstock fed the iodine-rich feed had a T 4 concentration of 3. 29 ng/g, significantly greater than 0. 09 ng/g and 0. 59 ng/g found in eggs from broodstock fed either the raw diet or the commercial feed respectively. Fertilized eggs produced from broodstock receiving the iodine-rich feed had T 3 concentration of 6. 43 ng/g compared with 0. 05 ng/g and 0. 21 ng/g for eggs from broodstock fed raw and commercial diets respectively. Broodstock held in tanks supplemented with KI (0. 08 mg/L) also produced fertilized eggs with elevated concentrations ofT 4 and T 3. Eggs from KI-treated broodstock had T 4 concentration of 1. 91 ng/g, significantly greater than 0. 09 ng/g found in eggs from untreated broodstock. Eggs from K 1 -treated broodstock bad T 3 concentration of 7. 81 ng/g compared with 0. 05 ng/g found in eggs from untreated broodstock. Threadfin larvae reared in ocean water grew significantly larger, and showed increased survival compared with larvae reared in water from a seawater-injected well that bad lower iodide concentrations. Larvae reared in ocean water developed more rapidly than in well seawater. At 14 days post-hatch, 50 % of the larvae reared in ocean water reached flexion-stage, compared with 15 % in well seawater. In ocean water-reared larvae, whole body T 4 concentrations increased sharply from 0. 4 - 0. 5 ng/g at hatching through day 13 post-hatch to 1. 9 ng/g on day 15, and declined gradually to 0. 5 ng/g by day 23. Larvae reared in well seawater did no show a peak in T 4, as levels increased gradually from 0. 2 ng/g on day 1 to 2. 4 ng/g by day 25. Profiles OfT 3 were similar between the two groups, decreasing from 0. 17 ng/g at 8 h before hatching to 0. 02 - 0. 04 ng/g by day 7 post-hatch, and then gradually increasing to 0. 45 ng/g by day 23. Whole body concentration of cortisol was 0. 5 ng/g prior to hatching for both groups, increasing to 27 - 30 ng/g by day 5. Cortisol levels fluctuated during days 7 to 25 post-hatch between 12 and 26 ng/g for ocean water-reared larvae, and between 14 and 32 ng/g for larvae reared in well seawater. Absence of a peak in the T 4 profile in well seawater-reared larvae may indicate incomplete synchronization of development or metamorphosis. Threadfin larvae reared in K 1 -supplemented well seawater grew significantly larger, and developed more rapidly than larvae reared in well seawater with lower iodide concentration. At 13 days post-hatch 42 % of larvae reared in K 1 -treated seawater reached flexion-stage compared with 26 % of untreated larvae. By 15 days post 79 " 10 of larvae reared in iodide rich seawater had reached flexion-stage compared with 66 % of larvae reared in seawater without iodide supplementation. Survival to day 25 however, did not differ statistically between control and treated larval groups. Significant diffirences in whole body T 4 and T 3 profiles were seen in larval cohorts from broodstock reared in untreated and KI-treated seawater and between larvae reared in untreated and KI -treated rearing water. These results suggest the importance of environmental iodide in maternal deposition of thyroid hormones in eggs, larval metamorphosis, and subsequent survival and growth. possibly through the synthesis of thyroid hormones...|$|E

40|$|Given the {{evolution}} of global infectious diseases and the interconnectedness of the international system, {{there is a risk}} of global pandemics. <b>Extraordinary</b> economic <b>losses</b> (border closing and quarantines) would occur. Health issues take pride of place in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the Copenhagen Consensus. There is a demonstrated relationship between health status and macro economic performance. The aging of the OECD population is among the factors that have lead to the perverse migration of health workers. There is a need to “scale-up ” well understood low cost interventions. R&D investments are skewed to those who need it least. The mushrooming of ambitious initiatives, each with its own way of doing business, has led to calls for "harmonization", and greater coordination across the many actors. Background Health and the risk of global pandemics is worth attention at the highest levels. Contrary to expectation, the life expectancy gap between the richest and the poorest nations had widened dramatically following the end of the Cold War. Today the gap between th...|$|R
40|$|Hot subdwarf B stars (sdBs) are evolved core helium-burning {{stars with}} very thin {{hydrogen}} envelopes. In order {{to form an}} sdB, the progenitor has to lose almost all of its hydrogen envelope right {{at the tip of}} the red giant branch. In binary systems, mass transfer to the companion provides the <b>extraordinary</b> mass <b>loss</b> required for their formation. However, apparently single sdBs exist as well and their formation is unclear since decades. The merger of helium white dwarfs leading to an ignition of core helium-burning or the merger of a helium core and a low mass star during the common envelope phase have been proposed. Here we report the discovery of EC 22081 - 1916 as a fast rotating, single sdB star of low gravity. Its atmospheric parameters indicate, that the hydrogen envelope must be unusually thick, which is at variance with the He-WD merger scenario, but consistent with a common envelope merger of a low-mass, possibly substellar object with a red-giant core.

40|$|The September 11 th Victim Compensation Fund of 2001 (the Fund) {{was part}} of {{legislation}} enacted just eleven days {{after the terrorist attacks}} of September 11 th in the wake of <b>extraordinary</b> national <b>loss.</b> It is possible, therefore, that the Fund will always be considered an urgent and unique response to the unprecedented events of September 11 th. On that view, the character of the Fund will have little longterm policy significance. It is equally possible, however, that the enactment of the Fund will prove to be a seminal moment in the history of tort and compensation law. The Fund adopts a new model for compensating loss of life. This model will inevitably be invoked as a standard against which other approaches may be measured, and it may well be employed again in the event that we experience another major terrorist attack on American soil. Thus, with respect to this new model of compensation, there is a sense in which the genie may be out of the bottle: What the Fund did will have to be considered whenever new approaches to compensating personal injury and illness are contemplated...|$|R
