40|$|The {{experimental}} {{characterization of}} RF structures like accelerating cavities often demands for measuring resonant frequencies of Eigenmodes and corresponding (loaded) Q-values {{over a wide}} spectral range.

40|$|Abstract. For the {{construction}} of an interpolatory integration rule on the unit circle T with n nodes by means of the Laurent polynomials as basis functions for the approximation, we have at our disposal two nonnegative integers pn and qn, pn + qn = n − 1, which determine the subspace of basis functions. The quadrature rule will integrate correctly any function from this subspace. In this paper upper bounds for the remainder term of interpolatory integration rules on T are obtained. These bounds apply to analytic functions up to a finite number of <b>isolated</b> <b>poles</b> outside T. In addition, if the integrand function has no poles in the closed unit disc or is a rational function with poles outside T, we propose a simple rule to determine the value of pn and hence qn in order to minimize the quadrature error term.

40|$|It is {{well known}} from the quantum theory of {{strongly}} correlated systems that poles (or more subtle singularities) of dynamic correlation functions in complex plane usually correspond to the collective or localized modes. Here we address singularities of velocity autocorrelation function Z in complex ω-plain for the one-component particle system with isotropic pair potential. We have found that naive few poles picture fails to describe analytical structure of Z(ω) of Lennard-Jones particle system in complex plain. Instead of few <b>isolated</b> <b>poles</b> we see the singularity manifold of Z(ω) forming branch cuts that suggests Lennard-Jones velocity autocorrelation function is a multiple-valued function of complex frequency. The brunch cuts are separated from the real axis by the well-defined "gap". The gap edges extend approximately parallel to the real frequency axis. The singularity structure is very stable under increase of the temperature; we have found its trace at temperatures even several orders of magnitude higher than the melting point.

40|$|The {{coupling}} of an unparticle operator O_U to Standard Model particles {{opens up}} the possibility of unparticle decays into standard model fields. We study this issue by analyzing the pole structure (and spectral function) of the unparticle propagator, corrected to account for one-loop polarization effects from virtual SM particles. We find that the propagator of a scalar unparticle (of scaling dimension 1 < d_U < 2) with a mass gap m_g develops an <b>isolated</b> <b>pole,</b> m_p^ 2 -i m_p Gamma_p, with m_p^ 2 < m_g^ 2 below the unparticle continuum that extends above m_g (showing that the theory would be unstable without a mass gap). If that pole lies below the threshold for decay into two standard model particles the pole corresponds to a stable unparticle state (and its width Gamma_p is zero). For m_p^ 2 above threshold the width is non zero and related to the unparticle decay rate into Standard Model particles. This picture is valid for any value of d_U in the considered range.

40|$|The {{asymptotic}} {{freedom is}} known to split the leading- BFKL pomeron {{into a series of}} <b>isolated</b> <b>poles</b> in the complex angular momentum plane. One of our earlier findings was that the subleading hard BFKL exchanges decouple from such experimentally important observables as small-x charm, F_ 2 ^c, and the longitudinal, F_L, structure functions of the proton at moderately large Q^ 2. For instance, we predicted precocious BFKL asymptotics of F_ 2 ^c(x,Q^ 2) with intercept of the rightmost BFKL pole α_(0) - 1 =Δ_≈ 0. 4. On the other hand, the small-x open beauty photo- and electro-production probes the vacuum exchange for much smaller color dipoles which entails significant subleading vacuum pole corrections to the small-x behavior. In view of the accumulation of the experimental data on small-x F_ 2 ^c, F_ 2 ^b and F_L we extend our early predictions to the kinematical domain covered by new HERA measurements.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{numerical}} method for calculating an evolving 2 D Hele-Shaw interface when surface tension effects are neglected. In {{the case where}} the flow is directed from the less viscous fluid into the more viscous fluid, {{the motion of the}} interface is ill-posed; small deviations in the initial condition will produce significant changes in the ensuing motion. This situation is disastrous for numerical computation, as small round-off errors can quickly lead to large inaccuracies in the computed solution. Our method of computation is most easily formulated using a conformal map from the fluid domain into a unit disk. The method relies on analytically continuing the initial data and equations of motion into the region exterior to the disk, where the evolution problem becomes well-posed. The equations are then numerically solved in the extended domain. The presence of singularities in the conformal map outside of the disk introduces specific structures along the fluid interface. Our method can explicitly track the location of <b>isolated</b> <b>pole</b> and branch point singularities, allowing us to draw connections between the development of interfacial patterns and the motion of singularities as they approach the unit disk. In particular, we are able to relate physical features such as finger shape, side-branch formation, and competition between fingers to the nature and location of the singularities. The usefulness of this method in studying the formation of topological singularities (self-intersections of the interface) is also pointed out...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe n-body {{problem is}} {{formulated}} {{as a problem}} of functional analysis on a Hilbert space G whose elements are analytic functions of complex dynamical variables. It is assumed that the two-body interaction is local and spherically symmetric, and belongs to the two-particle space G. The n-body resolvent R(λ) is constructed {{with the help of}} Fredholm methods. The operator R(λ) on G is associated with a family of operators R(λ, ϑ) on L 2 which are resolvents of closed linear operators H(ϑ), the case ϑ = 0 corresponding to standard quantum mechanics. The spectrum of H(ϑ) contains a set of parallel half-lines starting at the thresholds of scattering channels and making an angle 2 ϑ with the positive real axis. The half-lines are branch cuts of R(λ, ϑ), but matrix elements of R(λ, ϑ) can be continued analytically across these. The operator R(λ, ϑ) may have <b>isolated</b> <b>poles.</b> The location of these does not depend on ϑ. Each pole is associated with one or more eigenvectors of H(ϑ) belonging to spaces G. There may be poles off the real axis, the location of a pole determining for which values of ϑ it is on the physical sheet of H(ϑ). It is shown how poles off the real axis give rise to resonances in the scattering cross section, the shape of a resonance being as one would expect {{on the basis of a}} model in which the scattering takes place via a decaying compound state having an eigenvector of H(ϑ) with complex energy as its wave function...|$|R
