North of this interchange, {{the freeway}} runs more northwesterly as it skirts {{the eastern edge of}} downtown Flint. Near the campus of the University of Michigan-Flint, I-475 curves to run parallel to the Flint River before crossing <b>it</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> an industrial area. There is an interchange complex on the northwest side of the river that provides access to Stewart Avenue and M-54 (Dort Highway). I-475 then runs north and northwesterly parallel to a rail line operated by CSX Transportation. North of Carpenter Road, the freeway exits the city of Flint and enters Genesee Township. The Interstate turns to the east to cross into Mount Morris Township before meeting an interchange for Saginaw Street. There is one more interchange for Clio Road before I-475 terminates at a full interchange with I-75's exit125.|$|E

An ex-soldier, he has pawned most of his clothes to buy the gin in his basket, next to the pamphlet that denounces <b>it.</b> <b>Next</b> <b>to</b> him sits a black dog, a symbol of despair and depression.

25|$|The two airmen {{realised}} {{that they}} had to make for the French lines at night or risk capture by the Germans before morning. Bozděch left a pan of water and some more chocolate with the dog, and they locked it inside the farmhouse before heading off across the snow to a nearby wood. Almost immediately upon leaving the property, the night sky was lit up by flares fired by the Germans as they were looking for the aircrew from the nearby crash site. They had nearly reached the trees when they could hear the dog howling from the farmhouse. They agreed that the only course of action was for Bozděch to return and kill the dog. He left Duval in the snow, {{and went back to the}} house. As he approached he searched for a large rock or heavy object with which to kill the puppy in the most humane manner he could. The dog began to throw itself at the locked door as it heard someone approaching. Bozděch opened the door and found he could not kill the animal, instead picking it up and placing <b>it</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> his chest inside his flight jacket. The trio made it into the cover of the trees, and were discovered by a party of French troops who had been sent to look for them. They took the dog back to the base with them, where Duval was sent to the hospital. Bozděch met back up with his fellow Czech airmen in exile, who all played with the puppy. It was decided to name him Ant, after their favourite aircraft from back in Czechoslovakia.|$|E

500|$|Davidson further theorizes that Þorgerðr's name {{may have}} {{originally}} been Gerðr, reasons that this form {{is what is}} found in early skaldic verse, and, further, {{that this is one}} of the names given for the goddess Freyja. Davidson points out that Haakon may have later turned to the same goddess soon before he met his death, when he hid in the earth beneath a swine in Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar (collected in Heimskringla) chapter 48, and that this could symbolize a mound of Freyja, one of whose names means [...] "sow" [...] (Old Norse sýr). Davidson theorizes that the account of Olaf I of Norway dragging Þorgerðr's image out of its temple after Haakon's death, and burning <b>it</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> a depiction of Freyr (Freyja's male twin), further supports this view.|$|E

Jordan Sargent of Spin said that Mars wasn't trying to hide the Michael Jackson influence on the video, writing [...] "new low-def makes obvious — compare <b>it</b> <b>next</b> <b>to,</b> say, the video for [...] "Rock with You"".

He also wrote that the video was [...] "still a fun three minutes to sit through", mainly because [...] "Bruno mimics MJ's [...] "Rock With You" [...] moves so deftly". According to Joseph Atilano of the Philippine Daily Inquirer, [...] "everything from the choreography, stage lighting, and so on, serve as a heartfelt ode to that era". He wrote [...] "visually, the music video is tricked out with set pieces such as a disco ball and vintage stage lights. Even the manner by which the instruments were set up in the background show the attention given to even the minutest of details and the small things do matter when it comes to making a music video".|$|E

Speaking about Pisemsky's early works, Skabichevsky wrote: [...] "Dig deeper into the pessimism which has gone into full swing in The Muff and Marriage by Passion, put <b>it</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the mindset of an ordinary provincial man for examination and you'll be struck by the identical nature of the two.

[...] In 1965, {{the second floor of}} the Monitor building was renovated to display the museum's growing permanent collection, and with the restoration of the museum in 1990–92, it was turned over entirely to exhibition space and christened the Thannhauser Building, in honor of one of the most important bequests to the museum. [...] Wright’s original plan for an adjoining tower, artists’ studios and apartments went unrealized, largely for financial reasons. [...] However, as part of the restoration, architects Gwathmey Siegel and Associates analyzed Wright's original sketches to design the rectangular 10-story limestone tower, that stands behind, and taller than, the original spiral building (replacing a much smaller structure), which has four additional exhibition galleries with flat walls that are [...] "more appropriate for the display of art." [...] Also in the original construction, the main gallery skylight had been covered, which compromised Wight’s carefully articulated lighting effects. This changed in 1992 when the skylight was restored to its original design. [...] Funding for the alterations was raised partly through the controversial sale of masterworks by the foundation in 1991.|$|E
