2500|$|Prandtl {{made the}} {{hypothesis}} that the viscous effects are important in thin layers – called boundary layers – adjacent to solid boundaries, and that viscosity has no role of importance outside. [...] The boundary-layer thickness becomes smaller when the viscosity reduces. [...] The full problem of viscous flow, described by the non-linear Navier–Stokes equations, is in general not mathematically solvable. [...] However, using his hypothesis (and backed up by experiments) Prandtl was able to derive an approximate model for the flow inside the boundary layer, called boundary-layer theory; while the flow outside the boundary layer could be treated using inviscid flow theory. [...] Boundary-layer theory is amenable to the method of matched asymptotic expansions for deriving approximate solutions. [...] In the simplest case of a flat plate parallel to the incoming flow, boundary-layer theory results in (friction) drag, whereas all inviscid flow theories will predict zero drag. [...] Importantly for aeronautics, Prandtl's theory can be applied directly to streamlined bodies like airfoils where, in addition to surface-friction drag, there is also <b>form</b> <b>drag.</b> <b>Form</b> <b>drag</b> is due to the effect of the boundary layer and thin wake on the pressure distribution around the airfoil.|$|E
2500|$|Drag, in {{the context}} of fluid dynamics, refers to forces that act on a solid object in the {{direction}} of the relative flow velocity (note that the diagram below shows the drag in the opposite direction to the flow). The aerodynamic forces on a body come primarily from differences in pressure and viscous shearing stresses.

2500|$|According to {{scientific}} consensus, {{the occurrence of}} the paradox {{is due to the}} neglected effects of viscosity. [...] In conjunction with scientific experiments, there were huge advances in the theory of viscous fluid friction during the 19th century. With respect to the paradox, this culminated in the discovery and description of thin boundary layers by Ludwig Prandtl in 1904. Even at very high Reynolds numbers, the thin boundary layers remain as a result of viscous forces. [...] These viscous forces cause friction drag on streamlined objects, and for [...] bodies the additional result is flow separation and a low-pressure wake behind the object, leading to <b>form</b> <b>drag.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The German {{physicist}} Ludwig Prandtl {{suggested in}} 1904 {{that the effects}} of a thin viscous boundary layer possibly could be the source of substantial drag. [...] Prandtl put forward the idea that, at high velocities and high Reynolds numbers, a no-slip boundary condition causes a strong variation of the flow speeds over a thin layer near the wall of the body. This leads to the generation of vorticity and viscous dissipation of kinetic energy in the boundary layer. The energy dissipation, which is lacking in the inviscid theories, results for bluff bodies in separation of the flow. The low pressure in the wake region causes <b>form</b> <b>drag,</b> and this can be larger than the friction drag due to the viscous shear stress at the wall.|$|E

50|$|<b>Form</b> <b>drag</b> or {{pressure}} drag arises {{because of the}} shape of the object.
