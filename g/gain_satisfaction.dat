Primary outcome measures included participants’ self-confidence measured pre-, (immediately) post-, 6 -month post- and 12 -month post-course via a purpose designed 21 -item survey using a five-point Likert scale (1 =Very limited, 5 =Highly confident).

50|$|Klismaphiles can <b>gain</b> <b>satisfaction</b> of enemas through fantasies, by {{actually}} receiving {{or giving}} one, {{or through the}} process of eliminating steps to being administered one (e.g., under the pretense of being constipated). Klismaphilia is practiced by men and women, although men {{are more likely to be}} klismaphiles, as with most paraphilias. Klismaphiles might gain pleasure from a large, water distended belly or the feeling of internal pressure. Often, klismaphiles report discovering these desires after a chance administration of an enema sometime in their childhood, but some do report discovering these feelings later on. Klismaphilia is practiced both heterosexually and homosexually. The paraphilia may be used as a substitute or as an auxiliary by its practitioners for genital sexual activity. Usually, klismaphiles carry out normal lives and successfully engage in this behavior secretly. If this is the case they will probably try to conceal the pleasure they receive from these administrations.|$|E

40|$|Aims To {{compare and}} {{contrast}} levels of job satisfaction and job-related stress between doctors in New Zealand (NZ) and the United Kingdom (UK). Methods Self-administered questionnaire to 593 NZ doctors and 795 UK doctors. Job satisfaction was scored using the Warr, Cook, and Wall scale. Job stress responses were correlated to satisfaction scores. Results Overall, job satisfaction levels were high; however, UK hospital physicians {{were found to be}} significantly less satisfied with their work than both NZ physicians and surgeons. Satisfaction with work was found to vary with working hours, amounts of paperwork, level of governmental interference, and time spent in public or private practice. Conclusion Doctors in the UK face greater difficulty in <b>gaining</b> <b>satisfaction</b> from their work, as exemplified by the subgroup of UK physicians.

50|$|Mental-health {{problems}} - {{for example}} mental disorders involving {{certain types of}} psychosis or behavioral problems - can contribute in some individuals to {{an increased risk of}} recommitting acts which may be judged as criminal offences. Parole services and mental-health courts may help to reduce this. Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) is partly defined by a history of antisocial/criminal activity starting with conduct disorder in youth. Borderline personality disorder, also known in the ICD as emotionally unstable PD, may also relate to certain kinds of reoffending. When combined with substance misuse this increases the risk of reoffending significantly. A subset of ASPD, or a related category depending how the terms are defined, is widely known as psychopathy. Some studies have found criminal recidivism correlates highly with psychopathy. One definition of psychopathy sees it as an uninhibited gratification in criminal, sexual, or aggressive impulses and the inability to learn from past mistakes. Individuals with this disorder <b>gain</b> <b>satisfaction</b> through their antisocial behavior and lack remorse for their actions. Psychopathic prisoners in one Canadian study had a 2.5 times higher probability of being released from jail, even though {{they are more likely to}} recidivate. Punishment, behavior modification and therapy techniques may not improve the behavior of a psychopath. Psychopaths may have a markedly distorted sense of the potential consequences of their actions, not only for others, but also for themselves. They do not, for example, deeply recognize the risk of being caught, disbelieved or injured as a result of their behaviour. However, numerous studies and recent large-scale meta-analysis cast serious doubt on claims made about the ability of psychopathy ratings to predict who will offend or respond to treatment.|$|E
5000|$|The {{individual}} needs propaganda to <b>gain</b> <b>satisfaction</b> {{as a member}} of society. Individuals want to be informed and to participate in the decisions of the state. Propaganda is the outlet through which individuals obtain the satisfaction of having contributed to the state. It is a necessary instrument of a state or institution to spread information to members of the group or society. But for propaganda to succeed it must respond to a need on the individual's part as well. The individual is by no means just an innocent victim of propaganda when in fact he provokes the psychological action of propaganda by not merely lending himself to it, but also from deriving satisfaction from it. It is strictly a sociological phenomenon, {{in the sense that it}} has its roots and reasons in the need of the group that will sustain it. The great role performed by propaganda is in its ability to give the people the involvement they crave or the illusion of it in order for the masses to be artificially satisfied. Individuals are faced with decisions which require a range of information that the individual does not and cannot have without propaganda. Thus, the individual is unable to accept that he cannot form opinion on his own and is caught between his desire and his inability. People are willing and likely to accept propaganda that allows them to artificially satisfy their desire to have an opinion by hiding their incompetence. The individual does not mind being given preconceived positions because otherwise he would realize that he does not understand the problems of the modern world. The individual would then realize that he [...] "depends on situations of which he has no control" [...] and have to face this reality. The individual cannot live in the state of this harsh reality so he derives satisfaction from the veil created by the ideology and the sense of values it provides. The individual need psychological and ideological reasons why he needs to be where he is and propaganda is the mechanism that the state uses for this very purpose.|$|E
