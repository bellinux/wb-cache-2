50|$|The {{driving force}} of charge site-initiated {{fragmentation}} is the inductive effect of the charge site in radical cations. The electrons from the bond adjacent to the charged-bearing atom migrate to that atom, neutralizing the original charge and causing it {{to move to a}} different site.

40|$|Although many {{experiments}} {{have been carried}} out to elucidate the fragmentation of typical sulfonamide drugs, little effort has been devoted to understanding the reaction process theoretically. Herein, the characteristic fragmentation pathways were investigated by performing density functional theory calculations. Employing sulfamethoxazole as a representative sulfonamide, the structure of the molecular ion was initially examined. The site of protonation was found to be located at the nitrogen atom of the isoxazole ring, which could facilitate energy minimization by forming a hydrogen bond. The fragment ion A at m/z 156 was then recognized as the result of <b>heterolytic</b> S-N bond <b>cleavage</b> with the energy requirement of 50. 25 kcal mol(- 1). This result could be supported by analyzing the S-N bond nature and by the energy comparison of different reaction pathways. Formation of the fragment ion B at m/z 108 was attributed to a stepwise rearrangement reaction. <b>Heterolytic</b> C-S bond <b>cleavage</b> was the rate-limiting step of the overall reaction, with an energy barrier of 31. 93 kcal mol(- 1). This is in good agreement with the Fukui function and spin density analysis. The fragment ion C(T) at m/z 92 was also obtained from the <b>heterolytic</b> C-S bond <b>cleavage</b> of A, with the energy requirement of 29. 98 kcal mol(- 1). The results in this work suggested that formation of the fragment ions B and C(T) were competitive reactions with the major difference being the degree of the <b>heterolytic</b> C-S bond <b>cleavage...</b>|$|R

50|$|In <b>heterolytic</b> <b>cleavage,</b> or heterolysis, {{the bond}} breaks {{in such a}} fashion that the originally-shared pair of {{electrons}} remain {{with one of the}} fragments. This process is also known as heterolytic or ionic fission.|$|E
5000|$|In chemistry, {{heterolysis}} or {{heterolytic fission}} (from Greek ἕτερος, heteros, [...] "different", and λύσις, lusis, [...] "loosening") {{is the process}} of cleaving a covalent bond where one previously bonded species takes both original bonding electrons from the other species. During <b>heterolytic</b> bond <b>cleavage</b> of a neutral molecule, a cation and an anion will be generated. Most commonly the more electronegative atom keeps the pair of electrons becoming anionic while the more electropositive atom becomes cationic.|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} work, the {{unsaturated}} fatty acid substituents of some phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylglycerol species were converted to their 1, 2 -di-hydroxy derivatives by OsO 4. The subsequent electrospray ionization tandem low-energy mass spectrometry analysis of the deprotonated species allowed positional determination of the double bonds by the production of specific product-ions. The product-ions are formed by charge-remote and charge-proximate homolytic cleavages as well as charge-directed <b>heterolytic</b> <b>cleavages</b> and rearrangements. The commercial availability of pure species of the phospholipids in question was limited, {{and a number of}} species were therefore synthesized. The developed method was used to fully characterize the two isobaric phosphatidylglycerol species 16 : 0 / 16 : 1 Δ 9 and 16 : 0 / 16 : 1 Δ 10 extracted from the bacteria Methylococcus capsulatus. The presence of these fatty acids was supported by a gas-chromatography mass spectrometry investigation of the dimethyloxazoline derivatives of the species of the lipid extract. The present work demonstrates that a total structure characterization of acidic unsaturated phospholipids in isolate or in mixtures is accomplished by vicinal di-hydroxylation of olefinic sites and subsequent electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of the derivatized phospholipids...|$|R

50|$|This {{reaction}} {{results from}} the inductive effect of the radical sites, as depicted below.This reaction {{is defined as a}} <b>heterolytic</b> <b>cleavage</b> since a pair of electrons is transferred.

50|$|<b>Heterolytic</b> bond <b>cleavage</b> is {{a process}} where the {{electron}} pair that comprised a bond moves {{to one of the}} atoms that was formerly joined by a bond. The bond breaks, forming a negatively charged species (an anion) and a positively charged species (a cation). The anion is the species that retains the electrons from the bond while the cation is stripped of the electrons from the bond. The anion usually forms on the most electronegative atom, in this example atom A.|$|R
40|$|This brief review will be {{concerned}} with <b>heterolytic</b> <b>cleavages</b> of carbon— silicon and related bonds, and will concentrate on some more recent investi-gations by the author and his co-workers. The C—Si bond is fairly stable towards homolytic fission, and under free radical conditions the C—H bonds of organosilicon compounds are usually more readily attacked than the C—Si bonds 1. The C—Si bond is moderately polar, however, (Pauling electronegativities indicate that there is 12 % ionic character in the direction CSi+), and is relatively easily attacked by ionic reagents. Since C—H bonds break heterolytically in the same direction, C-Hf, a good indication of the behaviour of an R—Si bond {{can be obtained by}} considering the reactions of the corresponding R—H bond 2. For example, just as the C—H bond of chloroform, HCC 13, is readily broken by attack of hydroxide ion on the hydrogen atom, so the Si—C bond of the compound Me 3 SiCC 13 is broken, even more readily, in alkali, by nucleophilic attack at silicon. Again, just as aryl—H bonds are broken readily by electrophilic reagents such as bromine or sulphur trioxide, so aryl—SiMe 3 bonds are also broken readily by these reagents. It is usually but not always true that an R—SiMe 3 bond is more reactive than the corresponding R—H bond towards ionic reagents...|$|R
50|$|From a {{molecular}} perspective, traditional polymers yield to mechanical stress through cleavage of sigma bonds. While newer polymers can yield in other ways, traditional polymers typically yield through homolytic or <b>heterolytic</b> bond <b>cleavage.</b> The factors that determine how a polymer will yield include: type of stress, chemical properties inherent to the polymer, level {{and type of}} solvation, and temperature.From a macromolecular perspective, stress induced damage {{at the molecular level}} leads to larger scale damage called microcracks. A microcrack is formed where neighboring polymer chains have been damaged in close proximity, ultimately leading to the weakening of the fiber as a whole.|$|R
50|$|A {{covalent}} bond joining atoms in an organic molecule {{consists of a}} group of two electrons. Such a group is referred to as an electron pair. Reactions in organic chemistry proceed through the sequential breaking and formation of such bonds. Organic chemists recognize two processes for the breaking of a chemical bond. These processes are known as homolytic cleavage and <b>heterolytic</b> <b>cleavage.</b>|$|E
50|$|The 3 most {{important}} catalytic redox active states of NiFe hydrogenases are Ni-SIa, Ni-C and Ni-R (which have three different variations:). The light-sensitive Ni-C state {{can be obtained}} via one electron reduction of Ni-SIa. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic studies of the Ni-C state, which contained a Ni3+ with S=1/2 (see Spin-1/2) and a hydride bridging the two metals Ni and Fe, showed that the <b>heterolytic</b> <b>cleavage</b> of H2 {{takes place in the}} NiFe hydrogenase active site.|$|E
50|$|Formation and {{cleavage}} of the iron-peroxypterin bridge. Although evidence strongly supports Fe(IV)=O as the hydroxylating intermediate, the mechanistic details {{underlying the}} formation of the Fe(II)-O-O-BH4 bridge prior to <b>heterolytic</b> <b>cleavage</b> remain controversial. Two pathways have been proposed based on models that differ in the proximity of the iron to the pterin cofactor and the number of water molecules assumed to be iron-coordinated during catalysis. According to one model, an iron dioxygen complex is initially formed and stabilized as a resonance hybrid of Fe2+O2 and Fe3+O2−. The activated O2 then attacks BH4, forming a transition state characterized by charge separation between the electron-deficient pterin ring and the electron-rich dioxygen species. The Fe(II)-O-O-BH4 bridge is subsequently formed. On the other hand, formation of this bridge has been modeled assuming that BH4 is located in iron's first coordination shell and that the iron is not coordinated to any water molecules. This model predicts a different mechanism involving a pterin radical and superoxide as critical intermediates. Once formed, the Fe(II)-O-O-BH4 bridge is broken through <b>heterolytic</b> <b>cleavage</b> of the O-O bond to Fe(IV)=O and 4a-hydroxytetrahydrobiopterin; thus, molecular oxygen is the source of both oxygen atoms used to hydroxylate the pterin ring and phenylalanine.|$|E
40|$|This article {{highlights}} {{the revolution in}} main group chemistry that was ignited through the advent of frustrated Lewis pairs, a term coined in 2006 to describe the combination of sterically demanding Lewis acids and Lewis bases. This pairing was extremely effective in <b>heterolytic</b> hydrogen <b>cleavage,</b> with further applications in the activation of various other small molecules. These advancements are described herein, highlighting the application of both main group and transition metal-centered frustrated Lewis pairs in the capture and recycling of small molecules focusing on H 2, CO 2, CO, N 2 O, NO, and SO 2 activation...|$|R
50|$|In Lewis acid {{catalysis}} {{of organic}} reactions, a metal-based Lewis acid {{acts as an}} electron pair acceptor to increase the reactivity of a substrate. Common Lewis acid catalysts are based on main group metals such as aluminum, boron, silicon, and tin, {{as well as many}} early (titanium, zirconium) and late (iron, copper, zinc) d-block metals. The metal atom forms an adduct with a lone-pair bearing electronegative atom in the substrate, such as oxygen (both sp2 or sp3), nitrogen, sulfur, and halogens. The complexation has partial charge-transfer character and makes the lone-pair donor effectively more electronegative, activating the substrate toward nucleophilic attack, <b>heterolytic</b> bond <b>cleavage,</b> or cycloaddition with 1,3-dienes and 1,3-dipoles.|$|R
50|$|Ionization is {{the process}} by which an atom or a {{molecule}} acquires a negative or positive charge by gaining or losing electrons to form ions, often in conjunction with other chemical changes. Ionization can result from the loss of an electron after collisions with subatomic particles, collisions with other atoms, molecules and ions, or through the interaction with light. <b>Heterolytic</b> bond <b>cleavage</b> and <b>heterolytic</b> substitution reactions can result in the formation of ion pairs. Ionization can occur through radioactive decay by the internal conversion process, in which an excited nucleus transfers its energy to one of the inner-shell electrons causing it to be ejected.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} studied and commercially {{important}} transition metal catalyzed reactions is alkene hydroformylation. This type of catalysis allows for the functionalization of simple alkenes into aldehydes and gives a remarkably useful handle to generate other functional groups. This transformation {{can be carried out}} using a cobalt or rhodium catalyst in a hydrogen/carbon monoxide atmosphere and consists of four stages: metal insertion, migratory insertion, <b>heterolytic</b> <b>cleavage,</b> and ligand exchange. Breit et al. generated extended alkane functionality by hydroformylation, olefination, and then hydrogenation.|$|E
5000|$|The “1,5 ” {{hydrogen}} shift cause {{transfer of}} one γ- hydrogen to a radical site on a saturated heteroatom. The same requirements for McLafferty rearrangement apply to hydrogen rearrangement to a saturated heteroatom. Such rearrangement initiates charge-site reaction, {{resulting in the}} formation of an odd electron ion and a small neutral molecule ( [...] water, or acid and so on). For alcohols, this <b>heterolytic</b> <b>cleavage</b> releases a water molecule. Since the charge-site reactions are dominant in the less bulky alcohols, this reaction is favored for alcohols as primary > secondary > tertiary.|$|E
50|$|Almost all hydrogenases contain {{at least}} one iron-sulfur cluster (Fe-S cluster). As {{previously}} mentioned, these Fe-S clusters connect the nickel active site of the enzyme {{to the surface of}} the protein because they serve as an electron transport chain from the Ni-Fe redox site to the electron acceptor cytochrome c3 (see Cytochrome c family). These electrons are produced from the <b>heterolytic</b> <b>cleavage</b> of the hydrogen molecule at the Ni-Fe active site. Crystal structures of the hydrogenase show a Fe3S4 in the center of the chain, and a Fe4S4 cluster at the molecular surface. The distance between the internal Fe4S4 cluster and the active site is approximately 12 Å (Figure 4).|$|E
3000|$|The {{effects of}} substituents on the {{cleavage}} reactivity provide more direct experimental {{evidence for a}} particular reaction pathway [49].

50|$|In {{reactions}} with polar mechanisms, Lewis acid catalysis {{often involves}} binding of the catalyst to Lewis basic heteroatoms and withdrawing electron density, {{which in turn}} facilitates <b>heterolytic</b> bond <b>cleavage</b> (in the case of Friedel-Crafts reaction) or directly activates the substrate toward nucleophilic attack (in the case of carbonyl addition reactions). The dichotomy can have important consequences in some reactions, {{as in the case}} of Lewis acid-promoted acetal substitution reactions, where the SN1 and SN2 mechanisms shown below may give different stereochemical outcomes. Studying the product ratio in a bicyclic system, Denmark and colleagues showed that both mechanisms could be operative depending on the denticity of the Lewis acid and the identity of the R' group.|$|R
50|$|In chemistry, a leaving {{group is}} a {{molecular}} fragment that departs {{with a pair of}} electrons in <b>heterolytic</b> bond <b>cleavage.</b> Leaving groups can be anions or neutral molecules, but in either case it is crucial that the leaving group be able to stabilize the additional electron density that results from bond heterolysis. Common anionic leaving groups are halides such as Cl−, Br−, and I−, and sulfonate esters such as tosylate (TsO−). Fluoride (F−) functions as a leaving group in the nerve-agent sarin gas. Common neutral molecule leaving groups are water and ammonia. Leaving groups may also be positively charged cations (such as H+ released during the nitration of benzene); these are also known specifically as electrofuges.|$|R
50|$|In Friedel-Crafts alkylation, a Lewis acid - {{usually a}} simple metal halide salt - {{promotes}} <b>heterolytic</b> <b>cleavage</b> of a carbon-halogen bond in an alkyl halide and generates a carbocation, which undergoes electrophilic aromatic substitution. Although vastly useful in synthesis, the reaction often suffers from side reactions {{that arise from}} carbocation rearrangement, alkyl migration, and over-alkylation. Similarly, in Friedel-Crafts acylation, a Lewis acid assists in the generation of an acylium ion from an acid chloride (or occasionally acid anhydride). Although the acylium ion is often assumed to be the active intermediate, {{there is evidence that}} the protonated acylium dication is the active electrophile that undergoes subsequent electrophilic aromatic substitution.|$|E
5000|$|The MCM {{reaction}} mechanism begins with homolytic cleavage of AdoB12's C-Co(III) bond, the C and Co atoms each acquire {{one of the}} electrons that formed the cleaved electron pair bond. The Co ion, therefore, fluctuates between its Co(III) and Co(II) oxidation states two states are spectroscopically distinguishable: Co(III) is red and diamagnetic (no unpaired electrons), whereas Co(II) is yellow and paramagnetic (unpaired electrons). Hence, the role of coenzyme B-12 in the catalytic process {{is that of a}} reversible free radical generator. The C-Co(III) bond is well suited to this function because it is inherently weak (dissociation energy = 109 kJ/mol) and appears to be further weakened through steric interactions with the enzyme. A homolytic cleavage reaction is unusual in biology; most other biological bond cleavage reactions occur via <b>heterolytic</b> <b>cleavage</b> (in which the electron pair forming the cleaved bond is fully acquired by one of the separating atoms).|$|E
5000|$|Labinger {{postulated}} {{an inherent}} limit to OCM selectivity, concluding that “expecting substantial {{improvements in the}} OCM performance might not be wise”. Labinger's argument, later demonstrated experimentally by Mazanec et al., {{is based on the}} mechanism of methane activation, which is a radical mechanism, forming H and CH3 radicals by the homolytic cleavage of the C-H bond. Ethylene and ethane that are proposed products have C-H bonds of similar strength. Thus, any catalyst that can activate methane can also activate the products. The yield of ethylene (and/or ethane) is limited by the relative rates of the methane and ethylene reactions, and these rates are very similar. Reactions of the products lead to higher homologues, and eventually to aromatics and coke. The same limitation applies to direct pyrolysis of methane, which is also a radical process. Nevertheless, some recent work have shown that the mechanism of the OCM could be initiated by an <b>heterolytic</b> <b>cleavage</b> of the C-H bond on magnesium oxide in the presence of [...] atmosphere.|$|E

Physical characteristics of the studied systems such as colorability and relaxation time of thermal bleaching parameters were determined. Moreover, light-energy transfer-induced luminescence of lanthanide ions via coordination with the two spirobenzoxazines was monitored...|$|R
50|$|Although less common, {{transition}} metal complexes {{can act as}} cationic photoinitiators as well. In general, the mechanism is more simplistic than the onium ions previously described. Most photoinitiators of this class consist of a metal salt with a non-nucleophilic counter anion. For example, ferrocinium salts have received much attention for commercial applications. The absorption band for ferrocinium salt derivatives are in a much longer, and sometimes visible, region. Upon radiation the metal center loses a ligand(s) and the ligand(s) is replaced by functional groups that begin the polymerization. One of the drawbacks of this method is a greater sensitivity to oxygen. There are also several organometallic anionic photoinitiators which react through a similar mechanism. For the anionic case, excitation of a metal center is followed by either <b>heterolytic</b> bond <b>cleavage</b> or electron transfer generating the active anionic initiator.|$|R
