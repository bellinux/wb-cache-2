5000|$|Though {{initially}} a panentheist, Davidson's {{studies in}} Domodossola—including {{the work of}} the Italian Renaissance philosopher Giordano Bruno, Leibniz, Kant, and Rosmini—led him to a panpsychistic monadology, a theory that reality consists of an infinite number of mental or spiritual substances, each with an Aristotelian telos. <b>Human</b> <b>psyches</b> are unique however, because they possess autonomy, which provides the potential to become divine through proper, moral association with other <b>human</b> <b>psyches.</b> This allowed Davidson to reject pantheism, which, he reasoned, led to a God [...] "scattered through the universe...so that the total Absolute exists only in the sum of things taken together." [...] Rather, Davidson argued, God exists everywhere, but he [...] "exists fully or completely" [...] in each monad. Reality is a Göttergemeinschaft, a society of gods; metaphysical, social and spiritual unity is moral rather than ontological.|$|R

25|$|In modern Western astrology {{the planets}} {{represent}} basic drives or impulses in the <b>human</b> <b>psyche.</b> These planets {{differ from the}} definition of a planet in astronomy in that the sun, moon, and recently, Pluto and Ceres (considered as dwarf planets in astronomy), are all considered to be planets for the purposes of astrology. Each planet is also said to be the ruler of one or two zodiac signs. The three modern planets have each been assigned rulership of a zodiac sign by astrologers and Ceres has been suggested as the ruler of Taurus or Virgo. Traditionally rulership of the signs was, according to Ptolemy, based on seasonal derivations and astronomical measurement, whereby the luminaries being the brightest planets were given rulership of the brightest months of the year and Saturn the coldest furthest classical planet was given to the coldest months of the year, with the other planets ruling the remaining signs as per astronomical measurement. It is noteworthy that the modern rulerships do not follow the same logic.|$|E

There, hydrogen bombs were detonated inside volcanoes, killing the exiles, whose thetans were brainwashed on Hawaii and the Canary Islands, introducing various myths, such as the myth of Jesus, to conceal the thetans' origins. Eventually, officers of the Galactic Confederacy launched a rebellion against Xenu, which continued six years before capturing him and placing him in an electrified prison {{in the center of}} a mountain.

5000|$|The last motif, which Roy also {{focused on}} his 2008 [...] "Syncretism" [...] series, is also joined by [...] "abstract works" [...] (abstract {{in the sense that}} they utilize Non-Objectivist visualities in painting) that combine both fluid color-washes (of the style {{associated}} with Louis Morris) with thick, nervously-drawn gestural strokes with thick textures (like Sam Frances as loosened up by graffiti art), but combined in a visual montage of bright colors and sensual forms verging on an erotic descriptive intermingled with the materiality of daily life. This is then re-read into the artist's vision of nature and human experience, becoming palimpsests wherein we (as him) occupy surrealist-like dreams of wonder and regret ("Catching Clouds in Polychrome", [...] "Seen and Unseen", and [...] "Dawn Dispersed the Night"), narrate ironic metacommentaries of elitist consumerism ("Corporate Chic" [...] or [...] "Subliminal Abstract"), or a poetic return from civilizational (because patriarchal) hypocrisy towards a non-judgmental Nature that is motherly and nurturing ("Fragile Blue Sky"). The key to understanding these double-coded works is Roy's invocation of [...] "pareidolia", or the <b>human</b> <b>psyche's</b> ability to recognize patterns from otherwise random forms.

500|$|In the 1950s, Lacan's structuralist {{theories}} about Hamlet were first {{presented in a}} series of seminars given in Paris and later published in [...] "Desire and the Interpretation of Desire in Hamlet". Lacan postulated that the <b>human</b> <b>psyche</b> is determined by structures of language and that the linguistic structures of Hamlet shed light on human desire. His point of departure is Freud's Oedipal theories, and the central theme of mourning that runs through Hamlet. In Lacan's analysis, Hamlet unconsciously assumes the role of phallus—the cause of his inaction—and is increasingly distanced from reality [...] "by mourning, fantasy, narcissism and psychosis", which create holes (or lack) in the real, imaginary, and symbolic aspects of his psyche.

5000|$|Bernal {{directed}} and wrote his first film, Pagdating Sa Dulo (At The Top), in 1971. In this film we {{catch a glimpse}} into what Ishmael Bernal's ouvre would prefigure for the industry: it is a scene showing an aspiring actress (played by Rita Gomez) pondering on dreams blooming in deserts of desolation and dying out in a mirage that painfully conjures images of squatter colonies and sordid lives. The bold star stares out into the landscape and scans it, with the camera acting as her surrogate, but finally framing her against the embarrassingly majestic Cultural Center of the Philippines. The scene captures it all: the decadence of the Martial Law regime, along with its perverse aspirations to art, has doomed the destinies of Filipinos. From that time on, Bernal was established as an innovative and intelligent filmmaker who would not be content with conventional formulas of local film making. Under his name is {{a broad range of}} film genres and themes: historical dramas like El Vibora (The Viper), and the Bonifacio episode in the unreleased Lahing Pilipino (The Filipino Race); sophisticated comedies like Tisoy (Mestizo), Pabling (Playboy), Working Girls I and Working Girls II; experimental films like Nunal Sa Tubig (Speck In The Water) and Himala (Miracle); and contemporary dramas exploring <b>human</b> <b>psyches</b> and social relationships, such as Ligaw Na Bulaklak (Wildflower), Mister Mo, Lover Boy Ko (Your Husband, My Lover), Ikaw Ay Akin (You Are Mine), Relasyon (The Affair), Aliw (Pleasure) and the film classic Manila By Night (or City After Dark).
