A mass <b>flow</b> <b>controller</b> is {{designed}} and calibrated to control {{a specific type of}} liquid or gas at a particular range of flow rates. The MFC can be given a setpoint from 0 to 100% of its full scale range but is typically operated in the 10 to 90% of full scale where the best accuracy is achieved. The device will then control the rate of flow to the given setpoint. MFCs can be either analog or digital. A digital <b>flow</b> <b>controller</b> is usually able to control more than one type of fluid whereas an analog controller is limited to the fluid for which it was calibrated.|$|E

5000|$|Most {{conventional}} {{drip irrigation}} {{systems can be}} made to pulse by using a timer to reduce the watering duration and increase the watering frequency. [...] Some newer systems have been developed that utilize a pressurized reservoir. When the pressure in the reservoir reaches some predetermined pressure level the valve on the reservoir opens and a portion of the fluid contained within the reservoir is forcefully discharged. While the fluid is discharging the pressure within the reservoir decreases. When the decrease in water pressure reaches a predetermined level the valve closes to resume the charging phase. The charge-discharge cycling will continue as long as the flow rate coming in through the inlet is less than the expel rate passing out through the outlets while the valve is open. A device called a drip <b>flow</b> <b>controller</b> is placed at the inlet for this purpose to regulate the flow into the inlet.|$|E

5000|$|The {{direction}} of flow {{in and around}} a separator along with other flow instruments are usually illustrated on the Piping and instrumentation diagram, (P&ID). Some of these flow instruments include the Flow Indicator (FI), Flow Transmitter (FT) and the <b>Flow</b> <b>Controller</b> (FC). Flow {{is of paramount importance}} in {{the oil and gas industry}} because flow, as a major process variable is essentially important in that its understanding helps engineers come up with better designs and enables them to confidently carry out additional research. Mohan et al (1999) [...] carried out a research into the design and development of separators for a three-phase flow system. The purpose of the study was to investigate the complex multiphase hydrodynamic flow behaviour in a three-phase oil and gas separator. A mechanistic model was developed alongside a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulator. These were then used to carry out a detailed experimentation on the three-phase separator. The experimental and CFD simulation results were suitably integrated with the mechanistic model. The simulation time for the experiment was 20 seconds with the oil specific gravity as 0.885, and the separator lower part length and diameter were 4-ft and 3-inches respectively. The first set of experiment became a basis through which detailed investigations were used to carry out and to conduct similar simulation studies for different flow velocities and other operating conditions as well.|$|E

At {{this time it was}} considered that 1:10 people attempting Everest would die trying. Some years later he got a letter from the Nepalese Mountaineering Association thanking him for reducing the death rate from 1:10 to less than 1:700 (no typo). The Topout (Topout, to succeed, to summit a mountain or route) system was firmly established. The demand was such that Ted had to leave the Service early to concentrate on this new business. He went onto produce a new: cylinder, cylinder valve, regulator and <b>flow</b> <b>controller.</b> Lastly he has built a plant to produce oxygen in Nepal in order to guarantee the quality of the gas that Topout supplies.A request to work with the Everest Skydive Team was taken up to give them a better oxygen system for jumps exiting the aircraft level with the summit of Everest.

50|$|As earlier stated, flow {{instruments}} that function with the separator in an {{oil and gas}} environment include the flow indicator, flow transmitter and the <b>flow</b> <b>controller.</b> Due to maintenance (which will be discussed later) or due to high usage, these flowmeters do need to be calibrated from time to time. Calibration {{can be defined as}} the process of referencing signals of known quantity that has been predetermined to suit the range of measurements required. Calibration can also be seen from a mathematical point of view in which the flowmeters are standardized by determining the deviation from the predetermined standard so as to ascertain the proper correction factors. In determining the deviation from the predetermined standard, the actual flowrate is usually first determined {{with the use of a}} master meter which is a type of flowmeter that has been calibrated with a high degree of accuracy or by weighing the flow so as to be able to obtain a gravimetric reading of the mass flow. Another type of meter used is the transfer meter. However, according to Ting et al (1989), transfer meters have been proven to be less accurate if the operating conditions are different from its original calibrated points. According to Yoder (2000), the types of flowmeters used as master meters include turbine meters, positive displacement meters, venturi meters, and Coriolis meters. In the U.S., master meters are often calibrated at a flow lab that has been certified by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, (NIST). NIST certification of a flowmeter lab means that its methods have been approved by NIST. Normally, this includes NIST traceability, meaning that the standards used in the flowmeter calibration process have been certified by NIST or are causally linked back to standards that have been approved by NIST. However, there is a general belief in the industry that the second method which involves the gravimetric weighing of the amount of fluid (liquid or gas) that actually flows through the meter into or out of a container during the calibration procedure is the most ideal method for measuring the actual amount of flow. Apparently, the weighing scale used for this method also has to be traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as well.In ascertaining a proper correction factor, there is often no simple hardware adjustment to make the flowmeter start reading correctly. Instead, the deviation from the correct reading is recorded at a variety of flowrates. The data points are plotted, comparing the flowmeter output to the actual flowrate as determined by the standardized National Institute of Standards and Technology master meter or weigh scale.|$|E

The "symmetry" here captures the scenario when certain utility and pricing parameters are the same across all active users, for which we derive closed-form necessary and sufficient conditions for stability and robustness under parameter variations. In addition, the ranges of values for the utility and pricing parameters for which stability is guaranteed are computed exactly.
