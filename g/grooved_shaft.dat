50|$|A {{push nut}} resembles a toothed washer, {{commonly}} fabricated in metal. These are installed by pressing onto {{the end of}} a <b>grooved</b> <b>shaft,</b> until the nut's inner teeth snap into the groove. The use of push nuts avoids the cost of threading a nut onto the end of the shaft during the manufacturing process. However, a push nut once installed is normally destroyed in the removal process, which potentially prevents removal of mechanisms captive to the shaft for replacement or servicing without having the correct replacement push nut on hand—if the part number and specification for the push nut is even known—and possibly also requires a specialized pressing tool to conform with manufacturer's guidance.|$|E

Now these engines have {{the form of}} a bow, but on the under side of them a grooved wooden shaft projects; this shaft is so fitted to the bow that it is free to move, and rests upon a {{straight}} iron bed. So when men wish to shoot at the enemy with this, they make the parts of the bow which form the ends bend toward one another by means of a short rope fastened to them, and they place in the <b>grooved</b> <b>shaft</b> the arrow, which is about one half the length of the ordinary missiles which they shoot from bows, but about four times as wide...but the missile is discharged from the shaft, and with such force that it attains the distance of not less than two bow-shots, and that, when it hits a tree or a rock, it pierces it easily. Such is the engine which bears this name, being so called because it shoots with very great force ...|$|E

40|$|Now forging parts {{papermaking}} machines uses {{many different}} designs presses. Regardless {{of the type}} of construction, the water is filtered through paper to canvas cloth in the transverse direction, filtering water from the cloth can occur in the longitudinal direction (simple presses) or in the transverse direction (shaft with blind holes, <b>grooved</b> <b>shaft,</b> suction shaft). Presses of the native papermaking machines provide a dry cloth when pressed, about 35 ? 40 %. That is not enough, as for drying the paper spent a huge amount of thermal energy in the form of steam, so the development of the press, providing a significant increase in dry is relevant. One way of increasing dryness is usage of shoe press, which by increasing the length of the contact area increased while pressing, so dry cloth before drying section increasing to 50 ? 55 %. Work of presses of papermaking machine is measured by the amount of water removed, and uniform moisture content across the width of fabric after the presses. Dehydration capacity of presses depends primarily on the length of the extrusion zone delighted shaft and on the number of these zones. When pressing simultaneously with dehydration of the paper web changing its structure, increases the contact area between the fibers and the coupling strength between them. In the existing literature does not sufficiently covered shoe-type presses calculation that does not allow constructing them because kinetic regularities of the process is unknown. The {{purpose of this article is}} to establish the kinetics of the compaction and main parameters shoe-type press needed to develop methods of calculation and design shoe presses. In the conventional two-shaft presses created considerable common pressure gradient and significantly lower hydraulic pressure gradient. In the developed design will increase the hydraulic pressure gradient by summing the camera of the shoe-type heated compressed air. Under the influence of the total pressure break down the cell structure of the paper web from which water is removed that the action of hydraulic pressure filtered in cloth, from cloth in the grooves of the shaft.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{of the influence of}} applied load and oil supply temperature on the performance of a 100 mm plain journal bearing with two axial grooves located at ± 90 º to the load line has been carried out. Hydrodynamic pressure at the mid-plane of the bearing, temperature profiles at the oil-bush and oil-shaft interfaces, bush torque, oil flow rate and shaft position were measured for variable operating conditions. The applied load varied from 2 to 10 kN, whereas the supply temperature ranged from 35 to 50 ºC. Bearing performance is strongly dependent on these parameters. It was found that the cooling effect of the downstream groove increases when the applied load increases. The opposite occurs with the upstream <b>groove.</b> <b>Shaft</b> temperature was found to be close to the maximum bearing temperature for low applied loads, but was significantly lower than this value for high loads. The increase in maximum bearing temperature was between 30 and 50 % of the corresponding increase in supply temperature...|$|R

40|$|It {{is often}} assumed that a twin groove {{arrangement}} {{will provide a}} more effective lubrication and a cooler operation than a single groove one, but little evidence {{has been found in}} support of this claim. Furthermore, there are no experimental works, to the authors’ knowledge, that compare the performance of single and twin axial groove bearings with the same geometry. An experimental assessment of a journal bearing with either two axial grooves located at +/- 90 º or just one single groove at + 90 º to the load line was performed. The comparison was made by using the same bearing for both groove configurations but the oil feeding to the - 90 º groove was shut with a valve in one of the cases in order to emulate a single groove bearing. Measurements of total and partial lubricant flow rate through each <b>groove,</b> <b>shaft</b> locus, inner bush surface temperature, oil outlet temperature and electrical motor consumption were performed. For the range of applied loads tested the twin groove journal bearing displayed a lower maximum temperature but a higher outlet temperature and eccentricity than the single groove journal bearing. Also the measured total flow rate in the bearing was approximately the same for the single and the twin groove arrangements. For the twin groove bearing, the partial flow rate through each groove varied dramatically with increasing load: At high eccentricities the flow being supplied to the active land of the bearing through the + 90 º groove was much lower than that supplied to the non-active land of the bearing through the - 90 º groove. Actually, the measured flow rate at the + 90 º groove was almost zero for the highest load tested, with nearly all the lubricant being fed to the non-active land of the bearing through the - 90 º groove. This means that under heavy load operation, the existence of an extra groove at - 90 º to the load line might actually deteriorate lubrication effectiveness when compared with a single groove arrangement...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{of the role of}} each groove on the thermal behavior of a 50 mm plain journal bearing with two axial grooves located at ± 90 º to the load line was carried out. The temperature profiles at the oil-bush interface, oil outlet temperature, oil flow rate through each <b>groove</b> and <b>shaft</b> locus, were measured for variable applied load and oil supply pressure. It was found that the cooling effect of the downstream groove is small for low eccentricities, becoming more relevant as eccentricity increases. The opposite phenomenon occurs at the upstream groove. The cooling effect is related to the flow rate in each groove. Under high load / low supply pressure negative flow rate at the upstream groove was detected. This phenomenon was found to affect dramatically the bearing performance. Increasing supply pressure yielded a decrease in shaft eccentricity along with a temperature decrease, especially for high loads.

25|$|A {{lockbolt}} is {{a fastener}} {{similar to a}} bolt in appearance and function. However, instead of using screw threads which connect to a nut using a turning motion, a lockbolt has annular <b>grooves</b> around the <b>shaft</b> of the bolt (pin). After placing the lockbolt in a hole, a threadless collar is forced at high pressures around the annular grooves, deforming the collar and permanently locking it into place around the grooves. Swaging is the generic term for setting a lockbolt and collar assembly. During the installation cycle of a lockbolt, the collar is deformed around the pin with locking grooves using special tooling. The tool engages onto the pintail, which is an extra portion of pin material protruding past the collar that the tool grabs and pulls. This force on the pintail pushes the joint together, and the conically-shaped cavity of the tooling is forced down the collar, which reduces its diameter and progressively swages the collar material into the grooves of the harder pin. As the force required for swaging increases during the process, the installation is finalised when the pintail breaks off.|$|R
40|$|International audienceToday, {{industrial}} CAD software rely on {{an incremental}} B-Rep (Boundary Representation) modeling paradigm where volume modeling is performed iteratively using planar sketched contours subjected to mainly extrusion or revolution operations. Even if CAD modelers provide operators (e. g. pad, pocket, <b>shaft,</b> <b>groove,</b> hole, fillet) {{to get rid}} of the direct use and manipulation of canonical surfaces and NURBS, working with a CAD modeler is almost procedural with a lot of intermediate operations required to obtain the desired shape of an object. Actually, all those intermediate operations are time-consuming and generate complex construction trees that are not particularly needed to describe the final shape. Moreover, using such a procedural approach, the designers have to make a mental gymnastic to break down the object body into several basic shapes linked to the different operators of the CAD software. Clearly, an approach closer to the designers’ way of thinking is missing and there is still a gap between the ideas designers have in mind and the available tools and operators used to model them. Ideally, it would be more convenient to enter a semantic description of the shape, the CAD modeler being in charge of generating it...|$|R
40|$|An oil-film {{thickness}} {{monitoring system}} {{capable of providing}} an early warning of lubrication failure in rolling element bearings has been developed. The system is {{used to measure the}} lubricant-film thickness in a conventional deep <b>groove</b> ball bearing (<b>shaft</b> diameter 80 mm, ball diameter 12. 7 mm). The measurement system comprises a 50 MHz broadband ultrasonic focused transducer mounted on the static outer raceway of the bearing. Typically the lubricant-films in rolling element bearings are between 0. 1 - 1. 0 Î¼m in thickness and so are significantly smaller than the ultrasonic wavelength. A quasistatic spring model is used to calculate oil-film thickness from the measured reflection coefficient data. An accurate triggering system has been developed to enable multiple reflection coefficient measurements to be made as the contact ellipse sweeps over the measurement location. Experiments are described in which the loading conditions and rotational speed are varied. Lubricant-film thickness distributions measured ultrasonically are described and are shown to agree well with the predictions from classical elastohydrodynamic (EHD) lubrication theory, particularly at high radial loads and low rotary speeds. A range of parameters affecting the performance of the measurement are discussed and the limits of operation of the measurement technique defined. Â© 2006 Acoustical Society of America...|$|R
40|$|Aim of {{the project}} was to show the {{capability}} of increased tool velocities in riveting with selfpiercing solid rivets. The focus was on joints of high-strength steels with aluminum sheets. Also the combination of adhesive bonding with the high-speed riveting process was investigated. At some of the investigated sheet combinations a better joint quality, in terms of <b>shaft</b> <b>groove</b> filling, could be achieved by the high-speed joining process, whereby significant improvements in the connection strength properties could be reached. In addition, some investigations showed the ability to reduce the required width of the die forming ring by the usage of an elevated tool speed to reach a sufficient connection quality. Resulting benefits such as reduced deformation in the zone surrounding the joining point could also be demonstrated. By application of high-speed joining with self-piercing solid rivets as a hybrid joining technique (mechanical joining and adhesive bonding), an improved connectivity between the adhesive and the component was determined. A detailed process analysis showed that the different cutting behavior of the steel sheets at the high speed process is responsible for the advantages of the process in the first place, while the problem of early indentation of the forming ring in the die-sided sheet can also occur in the high-speed joining process. The impact of the early die indentation on the joint quality is less detrimental at the high speed process than at the conventional joining with self-piercing solid rivets. The sound emission of high speed process may represent a barrier to the use, as it comes due to sudden introduction of strong excitation energy of tools and components during the setting process. An implementation of the process in an industrial area requires further, more detailed studies about robust methods for the process control. Moreover, the test equipment developed for use in laboratory is relatively large, which limits the flexibility {{in the use of the}} investigated process. A high potential of high-speed joining as one solution for joining tasks could be revealed, where modern high and ultra-high strength steels are to be joined with significantly softer aluminum materials by self-piercing solid rivets...|$|R
