Gilpin were built around the parade ground in 1925, as was the RAF officers' hospital and the original Operations Room, controlled by the <b>Fighting</b> <b>Area</b> of Air Defence of Great Britain (ADGB). The Air Ministry chose RAF Uxbridge as the new base for ADGB on 14 January 1926 owing to its proximity to Whitehall. The site had the added advantage of lying on the fringes of London and therefore difficult for an enemy to locate and bomb. Having also housed a gymnasium, the lecture hall building became the station cinema in 1927, initially for the use of station personnel only but soon opened to the general public. On 1 March 1929, the headquarters of the Observer Corps was established at Hillingdon House; Air Commodore Edward Masterman was appointed its first commandant. The Observer Corps remained at RAF Uxbridge until 1 March 1936, when it transferred to RAF Bentley Priory.|$|E

Trenchard sent him to Palestine and Transjordan to study security problems caused by Arab–Jewish unrest: his reports, which gained Trenchard's approval, were a cause of further career advancement. Dowding became Air Officer Commanding <b>Fighting</b> <b>Area,</b> Air Defence of Great Britain in December 1929 and then joined the Air Council as Air Member for Supply and Research in September 1930.

Dowding's time in this office coincided with a period of rapid development in aircraft design and a growing fear that another major war was on the horizon.
