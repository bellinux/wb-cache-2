40|$|We used ethylcyclopentane (ECP) {{as a model}} <b>alicyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> and {{investigated}} its metabolism by a sulfate-reducing bacterial enrichment {{obtained from}} a gas condensate-contaminated aquifer. The enrichment coupled the consumption of ECP with the stoichiometrically expected amount of sulfate reduced. During ECP biodegradation, we observed the transient accumulation of metabolite peaks by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, three of which had identical mass spectrometry profiles. Mass-spectral similarities to analogous authentic standards allowed us to identify these metabolites as ethylcyclopentylsuccinic acids, ethylcyclopentylpropionic acid, ethylcyclopentylcarboxylic acid, and ethylsuccinic acid. Based on these findings, we propose a pathway for the degradation of this <b>alicyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbon.</b> Furthermore, a putative metabolite similar to ethylcyclopentylsuccinic acid was also found in samples of contaminated groundwater from the aquifer. However, no such finding was evident for samples collected from wells located upgradient of the gas condensate spill.

40|$|Owing to {{its unique}} {{electronic}} properties, the CF₂ group {{has the potential}} to affect the conformation and polarity of molecules. The Introduction provides an overview of the conformational effects induced by the incorporation of fluorine into hydrocarbons, e. g. gauche effect, 1, 3 -C,F bond repulsion and angle deviation in organofluorine compounds. A summary of synthetic strategies for the introduction of the gem-difluoride motif into organic molecules is also presented. In order to explore the conformational impact of the CF₂ group in <b>alicyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> systems, cyclododecane was employed as the molecular framework. In 1, 1, 4, 4 - and 1, 1, 7, 7 - tetrafluorocyclododecanes, two CF₂ groups replaced CH₂ units within the square [3333] cyclododecane ring where the spacing enables the CF₂ groups to occupy adjacent or opposite corner locations. In the case of 1, 1, 6, 6 -tetrafluorocyclododecane, one of the CF₂ groups was forced to the edge position, which changes the ring conformation dramatically. Strategic incorporation of two CF₂ groups is shown to either stabilise or significantly alter the conformation of the cyclododecane framework, a revealing conformational preference of the CF₂ group to locate at the corner rather than the edge position of hydrocarbon rings. The study extends to larger cycloalkanes, rectangular [3434] cyclotetradecanes and square [4444] cyclohexadecanes. The target cycloalkanes bearing two CF₂ units were assembled through a novel synthetic route, employing ring-closing metathesis (RCM) as the key step. X-Ray structure analyses revealed that the CF₂ groups occupy exclusively corner locations of these rings too. The spacing between the CF₂ moieties dictates the overall ring conformations and offers a useful tool for controlling molecular arrangement. An accelerating role of the CF₂ group, relative to the CH₂ group, on the ring-closing metathesis of C 5 -substituted 1, 8 -nonadienes has also been studied. Remarkably, the CF₂ group exhibited a similar reaction rate to that observed for nonadienes bearing 1, 3 -dioxolane or dimethylmalonate groups.

With a standard format, five epidemiologists extracted risk estimates and variables of the structure and quality of each study. The extracted data were centrally checked. Random meta-models were applied.  RESULTS—Based on 20  populations, exposure to chlorinated hydrocarbon (CHC) solvents and related compounds {{was associated with a}} meta-risk ratio (MRR) of 1. 4  (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1. 0  to 1. 8). Nickel and nickel compounds were considered in four populations (1. 9; 1. 2  to 3. 2). Excesses were found also for chromium and chromium compounds (1. 4; 0. 9  to 2. 3), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (1. 5; 0. 9  to 2. 5), organochlorine insecticides (1. 5; 0. 6  to 3. 7), silica dust (1. 4; 0. 9  to 2. 0), and aliphatic and <b>alicyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> solvents (1. 3; 0. 8  to 2. 8).

40|$|Several cyclic and <b>alicyclic</b> CI 1 <b>hydrocarbons</b> {{have been}} shown to act as gamete {{releasing}} and/or attracting pheromones during sexual reproduction of brown algae (Phaeophyceae). The same compounds are also found in the essential oils of various plants, of which the occurrence of the cycloheptadiene-pheromone ectocarpene in Senecio isatideus (Compositae) is noteworthy. Administration of [3 H]dodeca- 3, 6, 9 -trienoiacc id to cuttings of this plant leads to incorporation of radioactivity into ectocarpene. Double-bond-deuterated nona- 3, 6 -dienoic acid is converted to fucoserratene, the pheromone of several Fucales, which is certainly not present among the hydrocarbons of Senecio.

40|$|Environmental {{concerns}} and diminishing petroleum reserves {{have increased the}} importance of biofuels for traffic fuel applications. Second generation biofuels produced from wood, vegetable oils and animal fats have been considered promising for delivering biofuels in large amount with low production cost. The abundance of oxygen {{in the form of}} various aliphatic and aromatic oxygenates decreases the quality of biofuels, however, and therefore the oxygen content of biofuels must be reduced. Upgrading of biofuels can be achieved by hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), which is similar to hydrodesulphurisation in oil refining. In HDO, oxygen-containing compounds are converted to hydrocarbons by eliminating oxygen in the form of water in the presence of hydrogen and a sulphided catalyst. Due to the low sulphur content of biofuels, a sulphiding agent is typically added to the HDO feed to maintain activity and stability of the catalyst. The aim of this work was to investigate HDO using aliphatic and aromatic oxygenates as model compounds on sulphided NiMo/γ-Al 2 O 3 and CoMo/γ-Al 2 O 3 catalysts. The effects of side product, water, and of sulphiding agents, H 2 S and CS 2, on HDO were determined. The primary focus was on the HDO of aliphatic oxygenates, because a reasonable amount of data regarding the HDO of aromatic oxygenates already exists. The HDO of aliphatic esters produced hydrocarbons from intermediate alcohol, carboxylic acid, aldehyde and ether compounds. A few sulphur-containing compounds were also detected in trace amounts, and their formation caused desulphurisation of the catalysts. Hydrogenation reactions and acid-catalysed reactions (dehydration, hydrolysis, esterification, E 2 elimination and SN 2 nucleophilic substitution) {{played a major role in}} the HDO of aliphatic oxygenates. The NiMo catalyst showed a higher activity for HDO and hydrogenation reactions than the CoMo catalyst, but both catalysts became deactivated because of desulphurisation and coking. Water inhibited the HDO, but the addition of H 2 S effectively eliminated the inhibition. The addition of H 2 S enhanced HDO and stabilised the selectivities but did not prevent deactivation of the catalysts. The effect of H 2 S was explained in terms of promotion of the acid-catalysed reactions due to enhanced catalyst acidity. Water and the sulphiding agents added to the HDO feed suppressed hydrogenation reactions on the NiMo catalyst but did not affect them on the CoMo catalyst. The addition of H 2 S resulted in less hydrogen consumption and coke formation than the addition of CS 2, but the product distribution was shifted such that the carbon efficiency decreased. It was concluded that, for the HDO of aliphatic oxygenates, H 2 S was superior to CS 2 as a sulphiding agent. The HDO of phenol, used as a model aromatic oxygenate, produced aromatic and <b>alicyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> in parallel routes in which the primary reactions were direct hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation, respectively. The addition of H 2 S on both catalysts inhibited the HDO due to competitive adsorption of phenol and H 2 S, and affected the hydrogenation reactions in the same way as in the HDO of aliphatic oxygenates. The opposite effects of H 2 S on the HDO of aliphatic and aromatic oxygenates were attributed to the different reaction mechanisms for oxygen elimination (dehydration, hydrolysis, elimination and direct hydrogenolysis reactions). The different molecular and electronic structures of the aliphatic and aromatic oxygenates are likely the reason for the different reaction mechanisms. Under the identical conditions, phenol was less reactive than aliphatic oxygenates on the sulphided catalysts. In contrast to the situation in the HDO of aliphatic oxygenates, the NiMo catalyst was less active for the HDO of phenol than was the CoMo catalyst. This work illustrates that the composition of biofuels determines the overall performance of the HDO process and the effect of sulphiding agent on the HDO. The HDO performance may be lower for wood-based biofuels, which contain mainly aromatic oxygenates, than for vegetable oils and animal fats, which contain aliphatic oxygenates. This conclusion further implies that operating conditions in an industrial process need to be more severe for upgrading of wood-based biofuels than upgrading of vegetable oils and animal fats. The addition of a sulphiding agent to the HDO feed will probably affect the total HDO of wood-based biofuels negatively and that of vegetable oils and animal fats positively. reviewe...|$|R
40|$|A {{process for}} the aerobic {{biological}} decomposition of guayule (Parthenium argentatum Gray) prior to extraction of the rubber by mechanical means was patented by Spence (1933). The process, called retting because of the loose analogy to the retting of flax {{for the production of}} linen fiber, produced a marked decrease in the impurities of the rubber and improved the physical properties of the vulcanized rubber. It also decreased the resinous acetone-soluble contam-inant from about 20 per cent of the crude rubber product to about 10 per cent, but no conclusions were drawn as to the agent responsible for the changes in composition and properties. The work reported in this paper is one phase of a reinvestigation of the retting of guayule by the natural microflora; it deals specifically with the decomposition of guayule resins. The resin of guayule is a mixture of acetone-soluble constituents of the plant. When the shrub is injured a clear resin exudes and dries.

Placing compounds formed from the oxidation of n-alkanes, terpenes and mono-aromatic hydrocarbons on the maps based on their predicted partitioning properties allows for a simple graphical assessment of their equilibrium phase distribution behaviour. Specifically, it allows for the simultaneous visualisation and quantitative comparison of the impact on phase distribution of changes in atmospheric parameters (such as temperature, salinity, WIOM-phase polarity, organic aerosol load, and liquid water content) and chemical properties (such as oxidation state, molecular size, functionalisation, and dimerisation). The graphical analysis reveals that the addition of hydroxyl, carbonyl and carboxyl groups increases the affinity of aliphatic, <b>alicyclic</b> and aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> for the aqueous phase more rapidly than their affinity for WIOM, suggesting that the aqueous phase may often be relevant even for substances that are considerably larger than the C 2 and C 3 compounds that are typically believed to be associated with aqueous SOA. In particular, the maps identify some compounds that contribute to SOA formation if partitioning to both WIOM and aqueous phase is considered but would remain in the gas phase if either condensed phase were neglected. For example, many semi-volatile α-pinene oxidation products will contribute to aqueous SOA under the conditions of high liquid water content encountered in clouds but would remain vapours in wet aerosol. It is conceivable to develop parameterisations of "partitioning basis sets" that group compounds with comparable partitioning properties, which – when combined with data on the abundance of those groups of compounds – could serve in the simulation of SOA formation...|$|R
