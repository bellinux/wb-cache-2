2500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Boeing {{came up with}} designs for {{machines}} with broad similarities to the Sea Knight and Chinook, but about {{twice the size of}} the Chinook in terms of linear dimensions. Proposed machines included the [...] "Model 227" [...] transport and the [...] "Model 237" [...] <b>flying</b> <b>crane.</b>|$|E

50|$|From the 13th century, Chinese {{pictorial}} designs, such as <b>flying</b> <b>cranes,</b> dragons and lotus flowers {{also started}} {{to appear in}} the ceramic productions of the Near-East, especially in Syria and Egypt.|$|R
50|$|In the aftermath, white cranes {{have become}} {{associated}} with dead soldiers, {{so much so}} that a range of World War II memorials in the former Soviet Union feature the image of <b>flying</b> <b>cranes</b> and, in several instances, even the lines from the song.|$|R
2500|$|Following {{award of}} an Army {{contract}} for {{a prototype of}} a [...] "Heavy Lift Helicopter (HLH)" [...] in 1973, Boeing did move forward on building an oversized <b>flying</b> <b>crane</b> machine, the [...] "XCH-62". Rotor diameter was to be 28 meters (92ft), fuselage length 27.2 meters (89 feet 3inches), and footprint length 49.5 meters (162 feet 3inches). Its widely spaced landing gear would allow it to straddle heavy cargoes such as armored vehicles, and still carry twelve troops in its slender fuselage. Boeing also considered selling a commercial version, the [...] "Model 301". The helicopter was powered by three Allison XT701-700 turboshafts, each rated at 8,079 shp, which fed into a combining gearbox capable of absorbing 17,700 shp.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{variants}} {{were initially}} envisioned: a 40-seat, short-range civil transport and a <b>flying</b> <b>crane</b> with a 15,000lb capacity. In March 1956, Westland {{decided to build}} the first prototype as a flying test rig with a tubular steel space frame {{in place of the}} main fuselage; cockpit power-train and undercarriage attached to this. With economy a priority, off-the-shelf components were used as far as possible, with donors such as the Westland Whirlwind helicopter and the Bristol Freighter aeroplane. This prototype was completed in February 1958; after the usual static and systems testing, engine runs and nearly 20 hours of [...] "tied-down" [...] engine testing, the first flight took place on 15 June. Flight testing showed up significant vibration. As a result, a number of changes were made {{in the design of the}} second prototype, including replacement of the main-rotor with the six-blade unit from the Sikorsky S-64. Once the statutory ten hours had been flown, this first Westminster was registered G-APLE and work started on constructing the second prototype.|$|E

5000|$|In art {{the scene}} was popular with little Pygmies armed with spears and slings, riding {{on the backs of}} goats, battling the <b>flying</b> <b>cranes.</b> The 2nd-century BC tomb near Panticapaeum, Crimea [...] "shows the battle of human pygmies with a flock of herons".|$|R

The cranes also winter in the Yatsushiro basin in Yamaguchi, Daegu in Korea, the marshes of Goryeong and the Korean Demilitarized Zone, the Yangtze River in China and so on. There are many cranes which change their wintering places depending on the climate conditions of the year, so the number of <b>cranes</b> <b>flying</b> to the Izumi plain changes from year to year.|$|R

50|$|After {{qualified}} {{success with}} his Sznycer SG-VI-D and SG-VI-E single-engined helicopters, Bernard Sznycer expanded his concepts {{to produce a}} <b>flying</b> <b>crane</b> / utility helicopter, intended to be inexpensive to produce and relatively cheap to operate. Sznycer designed the BS-12 as a cargo or <b>flying</b> <b>crane</b> helicopter with optional passenger accommodation and licensed development and production to the Omega Aircraft Corp. Powered by twin piston engines mounted horizontally {{on either side of}} the main gearbox the BS-12 was designed to be safe in an emergency for single-engined flight even at high gross weights. Accommodation in the <b>flying</b> <b>crane</b> version was for four, (later 5 in the BS-12D), including flight crew, which could be augmented by an underslung passenger cabin.|$|E

40|$|Wherever cranes {{occur in}} the world, their stature, intelligence, wariness, and sociality have {{captured}} the human imagination and {{have given rise to}} a variety of legends, myths, and folktales. Among the best sources of such information for England and southern Europe are the manuscript writings of Edward Topsell (1572 - 1625), which have been edited and recently republished (1972). Topsell reported that 2 ̆ 2 when fables ruled the world 2 ̆ 2 it was believed that a proud queen of Pygmies named Oenoe or Gerania was turned into a crane by Juno and Diana, because she taught her people to neglect other gods and worship her. Gerania thereafter began an irreconcilable war between cranes and Pygmies that has persisted ever since. Much the same story appears in the Iliad of Homer. From this legend perhaps came the Greek name geranos or gereunos for cranes. Likewise, they were sometimes known as the birds of Palamedes, since, at about the time of the Trojan Wars, the mythic hero Palamedes reputedly invented several Greek letters by watching the convolutions of <b>flying</b> <b>cranes.</b> The avian genus Palamedea, however, was subsequently applied to the South American crane-like birds known as screamers. On the other hand, the Romans called cranes grues, evidently because of their grunting voices...|$|R

50|$|The {{advent of}} the Mi-6 gave the Soviet Union the very useful ability to move and place large, bulky or heavy loads with precision. Limitations of the Mi-6 in the <b>flying</b> <b>crane</b> role {{included}} a weight to payload ratio and {{the inability of the}} crew to easily see the load and its intended final position. A Council of Ministers directive of 20 February 1958 tasked OKB-329 (OKB Mil) with the development of a dedicated <b>flying</b> <b>crane</b> helicopter for carrying bulky loads unable to be carried in the hold of a Mi-6.|$|E

5000|$|Matsumori Castle (Matsumori-jō), {{also known}} as Matsumoridate (...) , was a [...] Japanese castle in Mutsu Province. Located in modern-day Izumi-ku, Miyagi Prefecture, the castle belonged to the Kokubu clan, which ruled the area before the entry of the Date clan. Matsumoridate was {{also known as}} <b>Flying</b> <b>Crane</b> Castle (Tsuru-ga-jō 鶴ヶ城), because of its {{similarity}} in appearance to the spread wings of a <b>flying</b> <b>crane.</b> The last lord of the castle was Kokubu Morishige. After the entry of the Date clan, the castle was largely dismantled and became the traditional grounds for the Date clan's new year's falconry trips.|$|E
50|$|A popular {{version of}} the tale is that Sadako folded 644 cranes before she died; her classmates then {{continued}} folding cranes in honor of their friend. She was buried with a wreath of 1,000 cranes to honor her dream. While her effort could not extend her life, it moved her friends to make a granite statue of Sadako in the Hiroshima Peace Park: a girl standing with her hands outstretched, a paper <b>crane</b> <b>flying</b> from her fingertips. Every year the statue is adorned with thousands of wreaths of a thousand origami cranes. A group of one thousand paper cranes is called senbazuru in Japanese (千羽鶴).|$|R
2500|$|Ramakrishna {{describes}} his first spiritual ecstasy {{at the age}} of six: while walking along the paddy fields, a flock of white <b>cranes</b> <b>flying</b> against a backdrop of dark thunder clouds caught his vision. He reportedly became so absorbed by this scene that he lost outward consciousness and experienced indescribable joy in that state. Ramakrishna reportedly had experiences of similar nature a few other times in his childhood—while worshipping the goddess Vishalakshi, and portraying god Shiva in a drama during Shivaratri festival. [...] From his 10th or 11th year of school on, the trances became common, and by the final years of his life, Ramakrishna's samādhi periods occurred almost daily. Early on, these experiences have been interpreted as epileptic seizures, an interpretation which was rejected by Ramakrishna himself.|$|R
50|$|Weishui Lake {{is called}} as “Fairyland in the Southern Chu”. Meandering through the green hills and blue waters, Weishui Waterdam has a total length of 8969m and {{is said to}} be the longest earth-filled {{man-made}} dam in Asia. Dotted on the clear blue water are innumerable islets covered by green trees and bushes. Surrounding the lake are dark green hills stretching far into distance and disappearing into Wuling Mountains. “Mountains go alive with water, water becomes enchanting with mountains (山得水而活，水得山而媚)”. Under the blue sky and white clouds, with the hordes of white <b>cranes</b> <b>flying</b> from the woods to the water while the fish popping out their heads occasionally for making a scene of bustle and excitement, Weishui Lake and National Forest Park form a beautiful country scene, like a traditional Chinese ink and wash.|$|R
