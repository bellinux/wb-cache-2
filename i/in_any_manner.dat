5|$|As {{many more}} {{individuals}} of each species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, {{there is a}} frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>manner</b> profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, {{will have a better}} chance of surviving, and thus be naturally selected. From the strong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.|$|E
5|$|The Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works has {{protected}} the copyrights on literary, scientific, and artistic works since 1886. Article 9 of the Convention states that: Authors of {{literary and artistic works}} protected by this Convention shall have the exclusive right of authorising {{the reproduction of}} these works, <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>manner</b> or form.... Any sound or visual recording shall be considered as a reproduction {{for the purposes of this}} Convention. This means a composer has performing rights and control over how derivative works should be used, and the rights are retained at least 50 years after death, or even longer. Even if a song is a traditional arrangement in the public domain, performing rights can still be violated. Where they exist, performers rights may have a shorter duration than full copyright; for example, the Rome Convention sets a minimum term of twenty years after the performance. This created a market for bootleg CDs in the late 1980s, containing 1960s recordings.|$|E
5|$|The Internal Security Act allows {{persons to}} be {{detained}} without trial for acting <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>manner</b> prejudicial {{to the security}} of Malaysia or to the maintenance of its essential services or economic life. It is authorized by Article 149 of the Malaysian Constitution, which stipulates that if an Act recites that action has been taken or threatened by any substantial body of persons, whether inside or outside the Federation in respect of certain situations – including organized violence against persons or property, the excitement of disaffection against the Yang di-Pertuan Agong or the government, or the promotion of feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes of the population likely to cause violence – then any provision of that law designed to stop or prevent that action is valid notwithstanding that it is inconsistent with certain articles of the Constitution guaranteeing fundamental liberties. Upon Singapore's independence from Malaysia in 1965, the island republic retained both the Internal Security Act and Article 149 of the Constitution in its statute book.|$|E

25|$|Most of the {{prevailing}} theme in the movie has been cast on the Japanese Self-Defense Forces and on their legality as Japan's military force since Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, created on May 3, 1947 by the Allied Forces, meant that the JSDF is only allowed to defend Japanese territory from hostile invasion {{and not to be}} deployed <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>manner</b> on foreign soil.|$|E

25|$|The {{recycling}} of the railway into a trail is supported primarily {{by people who}} do not live adjacent to or near the right-of-way (ROW). Many people who live along the line support the conversion to a trail or back to a rail line. Many others, whose properties abut the ROW, are opposed to the ROW's redevelopment <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>manner.</b> A number of properties adjacent to the right-of-way have expanded their property fences over sections of the former right-of-way, without acquiring the rights to the land.|$|E
25|$|In January 1968, Garrison subpoenaed Kerry Wendell Thornley – an {{acquaintance}} of Oswald's from their days in the military – to appear before a grand jury, questioning him {{about his relationship with}} Oswald and his knowledge of other figures Garrison believed to be connected to the assassination. Thornley sought a cancellation of this subpoena on which he had to appear before the Circuit Court. Garrison charged Thornley with perjury after Thornley denied that he had been in contact with Oswald <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>manner</b> since 1959. The perjury charge was eventually dropped by Garrison's successor Harry Connick Sr.|$|E

McCown, who was leading one of the battalions of the 119th U.S. Infantry Regiment. Having heard about the Malmedy massacre, McCown personally asked Peiper about his fate {{and that of his}} men. McCown testified that Peiper told him neither he nor his men were at any risk and that he (Peiper) was not accustomed to killing his prisoners. McCown noted that neither he nor his men were threatened <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>manner,</b> and he testified in Peiper's defence during the 1946 trial in Dachau.|$|E

25|$|When the {{national}} flag has become worn or frayed {{it is no}} longer fit for display, and should not be used <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>manner</b> implying disrespect. The national flag, when used as a decoration, should always be treated with due respect. It may be used as a discreet lapel button or rosette or as part of a centrepiece for a table. When used in the latter context with the flags of other nations, {{the national}} flag should also be displayed in the place of honour on a nearby flag staff. Where multiple national flags are flown on festive occasions these should be of uniform dimensions. Bunting of the national colours may also be used on festive occasions.|$|E
25|$|As {{many of the}} {{contemporary}} theological journals published in Germany, Belgium and France make evident, Catholic theologians, rejecting Marxism, socialism, and the excesses of capitalism, debated and formulated social solutions that would come from the combined actions of the Church, the State, the employer and the employee, and elaborated in greater detail the principles {{to be used in}} seeking justice in industrial, social, and economic life. While Sheehan was aware of the social question of his time, and was actively engaged in the great contemporary social evolution directly affecting him in his parish, he can never be regarded as having <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>manner</b> espoused the Zeitgeist, as quickly emerges from his portrayal of such a priest in his novel Luke Delmege published in 1901 and, not surprisingly, translated into all of the major European languages.|$|E
25|$|Al-Mu'tazz's brother Abu Ahmad was put {{in charge}} of the Samarran forces at the {{beginning}} of the war. He was charged by the caliph with defeating al-Musta'in and Muhammad b. 'Abdallah, and was given the authority to command the army <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>manner</b> he pleased. Abu Ahmad's overall strategy was to keep Baghdad under constant attack from his troops, and to gain the surrender of the city by either assaulting it or starving its inhabitants until they lost the will to fight any longer. Toward this end, al-Mu'tazz sent armies to secure the neighboring towns that controlled access to Baghdad, and Abu Ahmad attempted to halt and seize any revenue shipments heading toward the city. The way in which Abu Ahmad ran the siege was not unquestionably accepted by al-Mu'tazz, who reportedly wrote him a letter in the middle of the war complaining of his lack of progress in forcing al-Musta'in's capitulation, but he remained in command of the main besieging force throughout the entire conflict.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the competition season, FIRST LEGO League sends official materials to each registered team, consisting of a 'challenge mat', LEGO bricks, and instructions for building the items for the mat (collectively known as the Challenge Set, formerly the Field Setup Kit). The teams also receive a list of tasks, called 'missions', to complete involving each model on the mat (i.e. taking a loose piece from one model and placing it inside another). FIRST LEGO League gives teams complete freedom on how to complete the missions, providing that they are completed by a programmed LEGO Mindstorms robot with no outside assistance. The robot has two and a half minutes to complete the missions. Each team has a minimum build period of 8 weeks to analyze the challenge mat, design and build a LEGO Mindstorms robot, and program it to fulfill the given missions <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>manner</b> they see fit. The robot must be autonomous, and may contain only one LEGO Mindstorms programmable block and no more than 4 motors.|$|E

25|$|In 1866, Congress legislated {{a remedy}} for a {{situation}} under which deadlocks in state legislatures over the election of Senators were creating vacancies in the office. The act required the two houses of each legislature to meet in joint session on a specified day and to meet every day thereafter until a Senator was selected. The first comprehensive federal statute dealing with elections was adopted in 1870 {{as a means of}} enforcing the Fifteenth Amendment’s guarantee against racial discrimination in granting suffrage rights. Under the Enforcement Act of 1870, and subsequent laws, false registration, bribery, voting without legal right, making false returns of votes cast, interference <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>manner</b> with officers of election, and the neglect by any such officer of any duty required by state or federal law were made federal offenses. Provision was made for the appointment by federal judges of persons to attend at places of registration and at elections with authority to challenge any person proposing to register or vote unlawfully, to witness the counting of votes, and to identify by their signatures the registration of voters and election tally sheets.|$|E
