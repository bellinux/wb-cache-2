5|$|Alternatively, if {{the density}} in the {{universe}} were <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> <b>or</b> below the critical density, the expansion would slow down but never stop. Star formation would cease with the consumption of interstellar gas in each galaxy; stars would burn out, leaving white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Very gradually, collisions between these would result in mass accumulating into larger and larger black holes. The average temperature of the universe would asymptotically approach absolute zero—a Big Freeze. Moreover, if the proton were unstable, then baryonic matter would disappear, leaving only radiation and black holes. Eventually, black holes would evaporate by emitting Hawking radiation. The entropy of the universe would increase {{to the point where}} no organized form of energy could be extracted from it, a scenario known as heat death.|$|E
5|$|Grid parity, {{the point}} at which the cost of {{photovoltaic}} electricity is <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> <b>or</b> cheaper than the price of grid power, is more easily achieved in areas with abundant sun and high costs for electricity such as in California and Japan. In 2008, The levelized cost of electricity for solar PV was $0.25/kWh or less in most of the OECD countries. By late 2011, the fully loaded cost was predicted to fall below $0.15/kWh for most of the OECD and to reach $0.10/kWh in sunnier regions. These cost levels are driving three emerging trends: vertical integration of the supply chain, origination of power purchase agreements (PPAs) by solar power companies, and unexpected risk for traditional power generation companies, grid operators and wind turbine manufacturers.|$|E

5|$|In October 1867, {{an agent}} for Swift & Co. {{negotiated}} a deal with Peru to purchase Catawba and her sister for a million dollars apiece. Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy, initially indicated that the company could repurchase the pair if it refunded the government's costs to build them, but {{changed his mind and}} said that he had no authority to do that. Congress debated the issue and ultimately decided that they would be appraised by a board of officers and that the highest competitive bid in <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> <b>or</b> in excess of the appraised value would be accepted. The ship was appraised at $375,000 and sold for that amount, possibly after a rigged bid, on 11 April 1868.|$|E
5|$|The Prana (breath, vital air) of {{the body}} is {{dispersed}} within and outside the body. The first aim of yoga is to become aware and control this vital air, to be <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> <b>or</b> lower than the inner fire within one's body. This inner fire resides in the middle part {{of the body}}, and he calls it the Nabhi (center) and a Chakra. This is the residence of the Jiva, and the vital air nourishes it from below while one is alive. Just above this Nabhi is the kundalini which normally is dormant. Yoga awakens her, by bringing vital air and heat to her.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} Persian ships and men {{involved}} with the battle are, as so often in the Greco-Persian Wars, somewhat problematic. It {{is clear that the}} Persian fleet did not dare conduct operations against the Greeks, and thus must have been approximately <b>equal</b> <b>to,</b> <b>or</b> smaller than the Greek fleet. Herodotus gives the size of the Persian fleet at 300 ships; the Greeks had 378 at Salamis, but must have suffered significant losses, and so they probably also had around 300 in total (though not necessarily all these ships formed part of the allied fleet for 479 BC). The Phoenician ships were dismissed from the Persian fleet before the battle, which reduced its strength further.|$|E
