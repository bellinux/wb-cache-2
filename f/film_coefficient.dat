50|$|Currently, {{reverse osmosis}} and vacuum-evaporation {{technologies}} {{are used to}} concentrate juices and other food liquids. In commercial operations, juice is normally concentrated by evaporation. Since 1962, the Thermally Accelerated Short Time Evaporator (TASTE) has been widely used. TASTE evaporators are efficient, sanitary, easy to clean, of high capacity, simple to operate, and of relatively low cost. On the other hand, there is some heat damage to the product caused by the high-temperature steam treatment. This treatment results in product quality and aroma losses. Because of the low value of the <b>film</b> <b>coefficient</b> between steam and treated juice, heat transfer between them is very inefficient. It leads to the cumbersome construction of TASTE plants. The alternative is to concentrate juice and food liquid by a cooling and freezing process. In this case crystals of pure water are removed from the juice, wine, or beer by crystallization. The aroma, color, and flavor remain in the concentrated medium. The quality of freeze-concentrated products cannot be achieved by any other technology. The main advantages in comparison with other freezing techniques are low energy expenditure and the possibility to tune {{the rate of the}} phase change from liquid to solid ice, which in turn increases the production of pure water ice crystals and simplifies the separation of concentrated juice or food liquid and ice crystals.|$|E

40|$|An {{identification}} procedure for estimating system parameters of rotating machines specially the bearing fluid <b>film</b> <b>coefficients</b> is described. A rigid rotor running on fluid film bearings is excited by random force.

A two-degree-of-freedom system with cross coupling effects is considered in the present study. In addition to direct FRFs (frequency response functions) or first order direct kernels, such a system requires definition of cross FRFs or cross-kernels and their estimation.

40|$|When {{liquid is}} sealed at high temperature, it flashes inside the seal due to {{pressure}} drop and/or viscous heat dissipation. Two-phase seals generally exhibit more erratic behavior than their single phase counterparts. Thermal effects, {{which are often}} neglected in single phase seal analyses, {{play an important role}} in determining seal behavior under two-phase operation. It is necessary to consider the heat generation due to viscous shear, conduction into the seal rings and convection with the leakage flow. Analytical models developed work reasonably well at the two extremes - for low leakage rates when convection is neglected and for higher leakage rates when conduction is neglected. A preliminary model, known as the <b>Film</b> <b>Coefficient</b> Model, is presented which considers conduction and convection both, and allows continuous boiling over an extended region unlike the previous low-leakage rate model which neglects convection and always forces a discrete boiling interface.

The management of generated heat in such circuits will require them to incorporate specialized design features for promoting the removal of unwanted heat from key areas and the limiting of component temperatures to safe levels. Hence, effective tools for predicting the heat transfer characteristics of three-dimensional circuits are required to develop optimum designs. This research encompasses a course of investigation including the development of such design tools and their verification using experimental methods. These experimental methods consisted of thermal tests conducted with prototype circuits constructed in three dimensions, with materials appropriate to the overarching design concept. After the verification process, the investigation proceeded {{with the construction of}} numerical models to compare a range of design features expected to enhance passive heat rejection in the discrete resistive component. The relative impact of each of these structures as well as the impact of specific material choices is comparatively evaluated using the developed tools. Further research centered on the fabrication and testing of a circuit which more fully incorporated the 3 -D architecture by employing a surface-mount technology (SMT) resistor and by embedding the resistor and conductive components within a cast polymer matrix. Experiments with this circuit and corresponding finite-element models showed that for the power dissipation levels investigated, the presence of the embedding medium actually results in lower temperatures at the resistive component. It was shown {{in the course of this}} latter investigation that <b>film</b> <b>coefficients</b> calculated by standard methods do not effectively account for interactions between adjacent convective surfaces in these circuit architectures.

Complete dye concentration versus time curves and peak gas concentrations were measured at three cross sections below each injection.

40|$|Graduation date: 1980 An {{experimental}} {{investigation has}} been performed {{to determine the}} forced convection heat transfer due to three-dimensional air flow over a flat plate {{as a function of}} angle of attack and free stream velocity. The experimental method employed a transient thermal technique and placed the convecting surface next to the exhaust port of an open circuit wind tunnel. The ratio of convecting surface width to wind tunnel nozzle width was 0. 7, but insulating surfaces extended beyond the nozzle width. The flows evaluated ranged in Reynolds number from 32, 000 to 140, 000 and from zero to 90 -degree angles of attack. The data indicated the probable existence of a turbulent boundary layer at zero and 45 -degree angles of attack. Data collected for angles of attack of 30, 60, and 90 degrees demonstrate mostly laminar boundary layer flows and indicate a dependence of the Colburn i-factor upon angle of attack. The j-factor was determined to be proportional to the Reynolds number to the minus one-half power, as in previous work, and the multiplier varied between 0. 876, as in a Pohlhausen equation corrected for unheated starting length, to 1. 114 as predicted in wedge flow measurements performed by Eckert. The results are different from those of Sparrow and Tien, which indicate a single multiplier of 0. 931 will provide solutions for all angles of attack between 25 and 90 degrees. The flow in this investigation is largely twodimensional due to the physical arrangement of the apparatus, whereas the flow used by Sparrow and Tien was primarily three-dimensional.

40|$|When {{modeling}} {{thermal performance}} of building components and envelopes, researchers have traditionally relied on average surface heat-transfer coefficients that {{often do not}} accurately represent surface heat-transfer phenomena at any specific point on the component being evaluated. The authors have developed new experimental techniques that measure localized surface heat-flow phenomena resulting from convection. The data gathered using these new experimental procedures {{can be used to}} calculate local <b>film</b> <b>coefficients</b> and validate complex models of room and building envelope heat flows. These new techniques use a computer-controlled traversing system to measure both temperatures and air velocities in the boundary layer near the surface of a building component, in conjunction with current methods that rely on infrared (IR) thermography to measure surface temperatures. Measured data gathered using these new experimental procedures are presented here for two specimens: (1) a Calibrated Transfer Standard (CTS) that approximates a constant-heat-flux, flat plate; and (2) a dual-glazed, low-emittance (low-e), wood-frame window.
