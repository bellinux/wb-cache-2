In doing so, Princeton is focusing on alternative technologies and fuels to <b>decrease</b> <b>the</b> <b>emissions</b> from the central power facility and the buildings it heats, cools, and electrifies which accounts for 85 percent of the Universities emissions. Another strategy the university is planning is to expand energy conservation through retrofits in existing buildings across campus, along with designing new constructions and renovations around campus to use 50% less energy than the amount required by current energy code. With a commitment to design all project with at least LEED silver equivalency. A new step in the climate change Princeton has proposed is applying an “internal voluntary “CO2 tax” when conducting financial cost-benefit analysis used to determine on whether to undertake energy efficient designs and technologies.” Allowing the university to place a monetary value on environmental impact, “which in turn will increase the “savings” that we would achieve by undertaking the project.” Transportation has been another main focus considering it’s the second largest source for the universities campus emissions footprint. In resolving this problem Princeton has planned to replace retire campus fleet vehicles with appropriate zero or low-emission vehicles, along with encouraging walking and biking as means of commuting through incentives and enhancing bike lanes and walking paths.|$|E

40|$|In {{response}} {{to the threat of}} global warming a variety of policy measures have been proposed to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2). However, policies which reduce CO 2 emissions will also <b>decrease</b> <b>the</b> <b>emissions</b> of greenhouse-relevant gases methane, nitrous oxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and sulfur oxides. When these additional effects are overlooked the net effect of CO 2 reduction policies on global warming is understated. Thus, emissions of all greenhouse-relevant gases should be included when evaluating CO 2 reduction policies. Other proposals which recognize the need to reduce emissions of all greenhouse gases have called for the reduction of a "C 0 2 -equivalent " amount. Policymakers evaluate these policies by using a Global Warming Potential (GWP) which is an index that supposedly indicates the relative radiative power of a greenhouse gas with respect to CO 2. This method, however, is flawed, as calculation of the GWP depends critically on the lifetime of the gas as well as the radiative effect of CO 2 which can change depending on the composition of the atmosphere.

In this article, we analyze the changes in environmentally damaging emissions to air in Norway from 1980 to 1996. In order to reveal the factors which <b>decrease</b> <b>the</b> <b>emissions</b> per produced unit, these changes are subdivided into 8 components. Our analysis shows that, holding emissions per produced unit constant, economic growth alone contributed {{to an increase in}} all emissions by about 60 percent. In contrast, decreased energy intensity, the substitution of cleaner for polluting energy types and other technological progressions have reduced the growth. Consequently, the growth in all emissions has been significantly lower than economic growth, and negative for some pollutants. The emissions of sulfur dioxide and lead had the largest reductions over the period. The main cause was technological changes, which have generated lead substitutes in gasoline and abatement technologies for sulfur. For most other emissions, the effect of technological changes was not sufficient to weigh up for economic growth. Then the emissions of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides grew over the period, but far less than the growth in GDP. The emission reducing factors may be explained by the general technological progress that follows economic growth.

To get data about air quality in Umea during the festival Umea County was contacted.   The most common mode of transport to and then within the festival was by car.
