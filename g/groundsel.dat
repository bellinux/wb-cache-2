25|$|The {{pathogen}} rust fungus or Puccinia lagenophorae and the Cinnabar moth Tyria jacobaeae {{have both}} been used and studied {{in an attempt to}} control infestation of Senecio vulgaris. One study showed that rust fungus infected Senecio vulgaris survived and actually used more of the available soil nutrients. The cinnabar moth eats <b>groundsel</b> between June and August, but the seeds germinate and the plant grows as soon as the ground is warm enough (and after a warm rain), making this an insufficient control almost everywhere <b>groundsel</b> can be found.|$|E

2500|$|Common <b>groundsel</b> as a {{medicinal}} herb {{does not seem}} to be recommended very often since 1931, when it was recommended as a diaphoretic, an antiscorbutic, a purgative, a diuretic and an anthelmintic, which was a demotion as it was previously suggested for the expelling of gravel of the kidneys and reins by Pedanius Dioscorides in the 70s-90s, for use as poultices by John Gerard in the late 16th century and as a cure for epilepsy by Nicholas Culpeper in the 17th century. More current information is contradictory about the dangers of the ingestion of <b>Groundsel.</b> A heavily referenced paper from 1989 suggests that the response is immediate and gives pre-ambulatory care recommendations. A Canadian poisonous plants information database references a paper from 1990 in presenting this prenatal warning: [...] "In a case of prenatal exposure, a mother ingested tea containing an estimated 0.343milligram of senecionine, resulting in fatal veno-occlusive disease in a newborn infant." [...] Information about the pyrrolizidine alkaloids, the substance present in Senecio vulgaris is much less contradictory and all warn of accumulation of the alkaloid.|$|E
50|$|The nival zone is {{the area}} above most vegetation. On Mount Kenya this area is usually above 4500 m.

2500|$|Common meadow wildflowers include Jeffrey's {{shooting}} star, elephanthead, Gorman's buttercup, alpine asters, American alpine speedwell, Indian paintbrush, small-flowered paintbrush, {{high mountain}} cinquefoil, Gray's ligusticum, green false hellebore, swamp laurel, and white bog orchid (Habenaria dilatata). [...] Also, Jeffrey's shooting star and marsh marigold grow {{close to the}} lake shore. [...] In the moist riparian area near the lake's outlet, there are Gorman's buttercup, yellow monkeyflower, Lewis monkey flower, arrowleaf <b>groundsel,</b> and false asphodel. Oregon saxifrage lives {{in some of the}} boggy areas around the lake.|$|E
2500|$|Flowers: Tall {{terminal}} {{spikes of}} <b>groundsel</b> flowers arise {{from each of}} the great cabbage-like rosette of leaves, each spike or inflorescence narrowly conical up to [...] tall and [...] in diameter. [...] The flower heads are upright (as opposed to pendulous in D. keniodenron) each consisting of 12 to 16 bright yellow ray florets up to [...] long and 60-80 disc florets. [...] Each leaf rosette dies after flowering, but the plant lives on because its highly branched growth form consists of multiple rosettes.|$|E
2500|$|Certain {{patches of}} the site have had {{specific}} plantings where weeds have been removed. [...] Representative of the local area, the site has battled overgrowths of non-native plant pests such as Lantana camara and <b>groundsel</b> (Baccharis halimifolia), as well as mosquitoes and ticks. [...] The site committee has an eradication plan removing from site invaders such as Camphor laurel trees, Asparagus fern, and plants not native to the area. [...] Much propagation of ornamental plant species is occurring through the birds having eaten the fruits from surrounding areas. [...] There are some issues caused by illegal dumping on the property's peripheral.|$|E
50|$|Dendrosenecio keniensis (syn. Senecio keniensis and S. brassica) {{is one of}} {{the giant}} <b>groundsels</b> endemic the higher altitudes of Mount Kenya. It is in the family Asteraceae and the genus Dendrosenecio (previously a Senecio). Dendrosenecio keniodendron occurs the upper alpine zone of Mount Kenya and D. keniensis in the wetter areas of the lower alpine or the moorlands.|$|R
50|$|Elevations of 8,200 to 9,000 ft {{are in the}} Canadian Life Zone, which {{includes}} the North Rim and the Kaibab Plateau. Spruce-fir forests characterized by Engelmann spruce, blue spruce, Douglas fir, white fir, aspen, and mountain ash, along with several species of perennial grasses, <b>groundsels,</b> yarrow, cinquefoil, lupines, sedges, and asters, grow in this sub-alpine climate. Mountain lions, Kaibab squirrels, and northern goshawks are found here.|$|R
5000|$|As the {{altitude}} increases the temperature fluctuations become extreme {{and the air}} becomes thinner and drier. This region {{is known as the}} Afro-alpine zone. The environment here is isolated, with the only similar area nearby being the Aberdares, which are 80 km away. [...] Many of the species here are endemic, with adaptations to the cold and fluctuating temperatures. [...] Typical plants here include giant <b>groundsels</b> (senecios) and giant lobelias.|$|R
2500|$|Cultivation {{with the}} hand or tiller is a {{recommended}} method of controlling Senecio vulgaris from growing in gardens and planting fields; cultivate {{to a depth of}} [...] The plant does prefer to take root in disturbed soils, so cultivation rids new plants but also buries and stirs up new seeds so the cultivation needs to be repeated at 14-day intervals. Seeds can still mature even when the plant has been killed; seed from plants cut in flower had germination levels of 35%. <b>Groundsel</b> seed numbers increased in soil during a two-year set-aside left fallow but not when there was a sown grass cover. The weed cannot live on grazed, trampled or mowed sites.|$|E
2500|$|The species {{found on}} Mount Kenya {{are by far}} the best model for altitudinal variation. [...] Dendrosenecio keniodendron is the species which grows at the highest of altitudes, Dendrosenecio keniensis is found at the lower altitudes of the range where the species grows and Dendrosenecio battiscombei grows at the same altitudes as D. keniensis but in the wetter environments. [...] The other {{mountains}} which are not tall enough to have a [...] "big one at the top" [...] have the two, one species for the drier land and one for the damper environments or just one because the environment is not so extreme. [...] This simplification works extremely well as an introduction to the giant <b>groundsel</b> of East Africa with one exception, Kilimanjaro who has the one species that lives at the top and only one species that lives below; subspecies and varieties living in the moister environments.|$|E
2500|$|Senecio vulgaris is {{considered}} to be native to Europe, northern Asia, and parts of North Africa. Its further distribution is less clear. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Natural Resources Conservation Service Plants Profile Database considers it to be native to all 50 of the United States of America, Canada, Greenland, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, the same USDA through the Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN) considers it to be native only to parts of Afro-Eurasia. The Integrated Taxonomic Information System Organization (ITIS), a partnership between many United States federal government departments and agencies states that the species has been introduced to the 50 United States, and the online journal Flora of North America calls it [...] "probably introduced" [...] to areas north of Mexico. Individual research groups claim it is not native to areas they oversee: Florida, Washington, Wisconsin, Saskatchewan, British Columbia, Missouri. The United States Geological Survey reports that Common <b>Groundsel</b> is exotic to all 50 states and all Canadian provinces with the exception of Georgia, Kentucky, Massachusetts, and Labrador.|$|E
50|$|For {{the period}} from the 9th to 11th centuries, in the regions from the East of Carpathians there are known more than 52 discoveries of Christian origin (moulds, brackets, pendants, <b>groundsels,</b> pottery with Christian signs, rings with Christian signs), many of them locally made; some of these discoveries and the content and the {{orientation}} of graves show that local people practised the Christian burial ceremony before the Christianization of Bulgars and Slavs.|$|R
50|$|In the plains, intensively {{cultivated}} for centuries, {{little of}} the original environment remains. The most commons trees are elm, alder, sycamore, poplar, willow and hornbeam. In {{the area of the}} foothills lakes, however, grow olive trees, cypresses and larches, as well as varieties of subtropical flora such as magnolias, azaleas, acacias. Numerous species of endemic flora in the Prealpine area include some kinds of saxifrage, the Lombard garlic, <b>groundsels</b> bellflowers and the cottony bellflowers.|$|R
50|$|There {{are five}} {{overlapping}} vegetation zones in the Rwenzori Mountains: the evergreen forest zone (up to 2800 m); the bamboo zone (2800 to 3300 m); the heather zone (3000 to 3800 m); the alpine zone (3500 to 4500 m); and, the nival zone (4400 to 5000 m). At higher altitudes, some plants reach {{an unusually large}} size, such as lobelia and <b>groundsels.</b> The vegetation in the Rwenzori Mountains is unique to equatorial alpine Africa.|$|R
