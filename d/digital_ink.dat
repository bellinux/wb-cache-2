5|$|Antonucci, an {{advocate}} of hand-drawn animation, wanted to ensure Ed, Edd n Eddy was produced in a way similar to cartoons from the 1940s to 1970s. As a result, the series {{was the last to}} use cel animation; the cels were shipped to Korea for creating the initial animation, and then later edited back at Antonucci's a.k.a. Cartoon studio. The first four seasons were produced traditionally, though the series was forced to switch to <b>digital</b> <b>ink</b> and paint in 2004, starting with Ed, Edd n Eddy's Jingle Jingle Jangle.|$|E

40|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>inking</b> {{systems are}} {{becoming}} increasingly popular {{across a variety of}} domains. In particular, many systems now allow instructors to write on digital surfaces in the classroom. Yet, our understanding of how people actually use writing in these systems is limited. In this paper, we report on classroom use of writing in one such system, in which the instructor annotates projected slides using a Tablet PC. Through a detailed analysis of lecture archives, we identify key use patterns. In particular, we categorize a major use of ink as analogous to physical gestures and present a framework for analyzing this ink; we explore the relationship between the ephemeral meaning of many annotations and their persistent representation; and we observe that instructors make conservative use of the system’s features. Finally, we discuss implications of our study to the design of future <b>digital</b> <b>inking</b> systems...|$|R
40|$|A novel information-hiding {{methodology}} denoted as <b>digital</b> invisible <b>ink</b> is introduced.

Messages hidden in digital contents using <b>digital</b> invisible <b>ink</b> cannot be correctly or clearly revealed unless certain pre-negotiated manipulations have been applied to the marked work. To facilitate such behavior, models and implementations based on both spreadspectrum and quantization-based watermarking approaches are investigated. Finally, benefits and limitations for applying <b>digital</b> invisible <b>ink</b> in common steganography systems and secret communications enabling plausible deniability are discussed...|$|R
5|$|In May 1995, Miyazaki took a {{group of}} artists and animators to the ancient forests of Yakushima and the {{mountains}} of Shirakami-Sanchi, taking photographs and making sketches. The landscapes in the film were inspired by Yakushima. In Princess Mononoke, Miyazaki revisited the ecological and political themes of Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind. Miyazaki supervised the 144,000 cels in the film, about 80,000 of which were key animation. Princess Mononoke was produced with an estimated budget of ¥2.35 billion (approximately US$23.5 million), making it the most expensive film by Studio Ghibli at the time. Approximately fifteen minutes of the film uses computer animation: about five minutes uses techniques such as 3D rendering, digital composition, and texture mapping; the remaining ten minutes uses <b>digital</b> <b>ink</b> and paint. While the original intention was to digitally paint 5,000 of the film's frames, time constraints doubled this.|$|E

40|$|Lecturers using tablet PCs with {{specialised}} pens can utilise real-time {{changes in}} lecture delivery via <b>digital</b> <b>inking.</b> We investigated student perceptions and lecturer experiences of tablet PC lectures in large-enrolment biomedicine subjects. Lecturers used PowerPoint or Classroom Presenter software for lecture preparation and in-lecture pen-based inking. Using surveys and lecturer interviews, students and lecturers {{were asked to}} reflect on their tablet PC lectures in comparison to non-tablet lectures that used prepared images and a laser pointer. Quantitative survey responses suggested that students felt that the tablet lectures were more interesting, that they were more capable of keeping up with the lecturer, and they enhanced their understanding of the lecture content. Qualitative analysis of written comments indicated that students appreciated the real-time writing and drawings, particularly because these were visible on lecture recordings. When reflecting on their non-tablet lectures, most lecturers used the pen-based writing, drawing and highlighting tablet functions and reduced lecture pace and content for their tablet lectures. Long-term tablet use led to lecturers making more use of <b>digital</b> <b>inking,</b> with less use of prepared images. Our results support the idea that tablet PC-supported lectures are conducive to improved management of cognitive load via reduced lecture pace and content...|$|R

500|$|Animation for {{the film}} began in January 2006, with the Itchy & Scratchy short being the first scene to be storyboarded.

The film was produced in a widescreen [...] aspect ratio, to distinguish it from the look of the television series, and colored with the largest palette the animators had ever had available to them. A lot of the animation was produced using Wacom Cintiq tablets, which allowed images to be drawn directly onto a computer monitor to facilitate production. Animation production work was divided among four studios around the world: Film Roman in Burbank, California, Rough Draft Studios in Glendale, California, and AKOM and Rough Draft's division in Seoul, South Korea. As with the television series, the storyboarding, characters, background layout, and animatic parts of production, were done in America.

40|$|Abstract. While screensavers {{generally}} display pleasant {{pictures or}} animations, our work discusses {{the possibility of}} utilizing a screensaver for reminding. We ported a peripheral notes display into a screensaver to support reviewing <b>digital</b> <b>inked</b> notes on TabletPCs. We demonstrated the screensaver to 18 participants, but they felt the screensaver was not useful {{in its current form}} as their notes became stale over time and as they felt the screensaver potentially leaked corporate data; however, they suggested a screensaver could be useful for more general reminding of items such as those in to-do lists or e-mail inboxes. Aiding Note-Review with a Screensaver Reviewing notes is tedious. While the meaning of handwritten notes might be deciphered immediately after writing them, the quality of notes degrade over time (Kalhikaité, 2007). Unfortunately, the value of the notes themselves remains under-utilized if people cannot set-aside the time for note review. Technology can potentially help by “bubbling up ” old notes into the user‟s peripheral vision, interleaving review into the normal workday. Hsieh et a...|$|R
