2500|$|Ashbourne {{is served}} by two public {{transport}} companies. Ashbourne Connect link the town with an express coach service direct to Dublin city centre and the southside of the city. The service is listed as 193 on the national <b>journey</b> <b>planner.</b> Bus Éireann provide a regular service (Route 103) from Beresford Place, Dublin, every 20 minutes. [...] Some of these services continue on to Ratoath, Kilmoon Cross and Duleek. At the beginning of March 2010, a regular service to and from Navan via Dunshaughlin and Ratoath to Dublin Airport that had previously not passed through Ashbourne was rerouted to serve the Pillo Hotel at {{the northern end of}} the town, and to then go through the town to the airport and Dublin City University. The service (route 109A) runs every hour from early morning to late evening. The 104 service that ran from Ashbourne to Blanchardstown Shopping Centre was discontinued at the same time, and replaced by some of the 105 service being extended from Ratoath to also serve Ashbourne. Route 177, with a low frequency, also served Ashbourne from Dublin, and went on to Slane, Ardee and Monaghan, with extensions to Clones but was withdrawn in November 2013. There is also a very limited service (Route 107) from Kingscourt to Dublin via Ashbourne. In November 2013 routes 189 & 189A were introduced linking Ashbourne to Drogheda and Clogherhead.The town was once served by a railway station ...|$|E

40|$|For {{planning}} and realization of travel chains <b>journey</b> <b>planners</b> can be used, but these often offer only partial solutions, especially considering the domestic operators. In order {{to reveal the}} improvement opportunities of the <b>journey</b> <b>planners</b> an evaluation method was developed. Using the method the <b>journey</b> <b>planners</b> can be compared in a quantitative way and ranked by functional, operational and visualization features. <b>Journey</b> <b>planners</b> of bus transport operators (Volán) in Hungary were analyzed and evaluated, some top features were also highlighted. The evaluation was performed taking the preferences of certain user groups into consideration, thus the values and ranking varied. The novelty of {{the paper is the}} application of our general evaluation method for Hungarian operators and the ranking among them, which provides input for development measures. The spatial properties of the <b>journey</b> <b>planners</b> were also represented in order to highlight the geographical differences...|$|R

50|$|After the <b>journey</b> <b>planner</b> has {{computed}} a trip or set {{of trips}} for the user to choose from, these are usually displayed either on a map (for most modes) or in a list (typical for flights). Often a <b>journey</b> <b>planner</b> will offer turn by turn directions for different legs of a trip, especially where the user needs to switch vehicles make turns, or change modes.|$|E
50|$|As {{the size}} of the {{transport}} systems covered by <b>journey</b> <b>planners</b> has increased, protocols and algorithms for distributed journey planning have been developed, allowing the distributed computation of journeys using networks of <b>journey</b> <b>planners,</b> each computing parts of the journey for different parts of the country. JourneyWeb, EU Spirit, Xephos, and the Delfi Protocol are all examples of distributed journey planning protocols. Another development in the 2000s has been the addition of real-time information to update the current schedules to include any delays or changes that will affect the journey plan.|$|R

Another part covers possible parameters for the journey search, from setting of basic location and time to optimizing other journey attributes. Following is an evaluation of <b>journey</b> <b>planners</b> already available. Then we investigate the source and form of input traffic data along with their availability.
