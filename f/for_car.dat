5|$|BP in its 2017 Energy Outlook {{forecasts}} {{that the}} number of plug-in electric cars will rise from 1.2 million in 2015 to around 100 million by 2035 representing about 5.5% of the global fleet of passenger cars. Around 25% of these plug-in electric vehicles will be plug-in hybrids and 75% will be pure battery electric cars. The oil company also projects that automotive fuel demand for use in cars will continue to rise, despite efficiency improvements in conventional internal combustion engines and increased plug-in car adoption due to growth in demand <b>for</b> <b>car</b> travel from the growing middle class in emerging economies.|$|E
5|$|Because {{bulk cargo}} is so {{difficult}} to discharge, bulkers {{spend more time in}} port than other ships. A study of mini-bulkers found that it takes, on average, twice as much time to unload a ship as it does to load it. A mini-bulker spends 55hours at a time in port, compared to 35hours for a lumber carrier of similar size. This time in port increases to 74hours for Handymax and 120hours for Panamax vessels. Compared with the 12-hour turnarounds common for container ships, 15-hour turnarounds <b>for</b> <b>car</b> carriers, and 26-hour turnarounds for large tankers, bulker crews have more opportunities to spend time ashore.|$|E

5|$|Bill Lear {{distributed}} the Stereo-Pak in 1963, intending to install units in his Learjet aircraft. However, he soon decided to re-engineer and customize the units to suit his own wishes, {{the result of}} which became the Stereo8 system. The market for Muntz's 4-track system had faded by 1970 due to competition from Stereo 8, which reduced costs by using less magnetic tape and a less-complex cartridge mechanism. Although the 4-track system had higher fidelity since the tape speed was double {{the speed of the}} Stereo8 system (and the 4-track had wider heads for better bandwidth), the Stereo8 quickly became the dominant format <b>for</b> <b>car</b> stereo systems during the late 1960s. Ford Motor Company began featuring Stereo8 players in their 1965 automobiles, and it became a standard option by 1966.|$|E

By 1917 the town's population was ten times what it had been when it was incorporated, so local leaders planned the original Acosta Bridge, connecting Jacksonville and South Jacksonville by road for the first time.|$|E

5|$|Iron {{and steel}} are used widely in the {{construction}} of roads, railways, other infrastructure, appliances, and buildings. Most large modern structures, such as stadiums and skyscrapers, bridges, and airports, are supported by a steel skeleton. Even those with a concrete structure employ steel for reinforcing. In addition, it sees widespread use in major appliances and cars. Despite growth in usage of aluminium, it is still the main material <b>for</b> <b>car</b> bodies. Steel is used in a variety of other construction materials, such as bolts, nails, and screws and other household products and cooking utensils.|$|E
5|$|The chassis of the C5 {{consists}} of two identical metal pressings which are joined at top and bottom with a closing plate at the rear. It lacks a separate suspension system, instead relying on the chassis structure having enough torsional flex. Its motor was produced in Italy by Polymotor, {{a subsidiary of the}} Dutch company Philips. Although it was later famously said that the C5 was powered by a washing machine motor, the motor was in fact developed from a design produced to drive a truck cooling fan. Lotus provided the gearbox and a rear axle based on a design <b>for</b> <b>car</b> steering columns. The C5's electronics were produced by MetaLab, a Sinclair spin-off. The wheels were assembled from tyres made in Taiwan and wheels from Italy. Oldham Batteries provided a lead-acid battery developed for Sinclair that could manage more than the 300 charge-discharge cycles that had originally been specified.|$|E
5|$|The summit {{was held}} in the Olympic Sports Centre, Riga. Roads in the center of Riga were closed down and parking was not allowed at the airport or at several roads, out of fear <b>for</b> <b>car</b> bombs. About 9000 Latvian police {{officers}} and soldiers took care of the Summit's security, while more than 450 other airmen from seven European NATO countries were called upon to ensure a no-fly zone above the summit in an operation called Operation Peaceful Summit. This enhanced ongoing Baltic Air Policing activities with additional aircraft, communications and maintenance support.|$|E

5|$|By 1966, {{the shops}} had been rebuilt in 'barren' Broadmead (at {{the expense of}} {{demolishing}} an area of Victorian, Georgian and Tudor buildings that had escaped the wartime bombing more or less unscathed), and the Wine Street and Castle Street area was being used <b>for</b> <b>car</b> parking. The picturesque area around Narrow Wine Street and Castle Mill Street had been demolished to create modern Newgate, and Old Market, severed from Bristol's shopping axis by the new Temple Way Underpass {{and the destruction of}} Castle Street, was in serious decline. The plan for Castle Park was crystallising, however. The ruined St Peter's Church would be surrounded by a museum and an art gallery; to the east of this there would be an arts centre and the remaining area east to Lower Castle Street would be a park. The south-western corner nearest Bristol Bridge would contain a riverside hotel, and the north-western corner would be home to 'a block for cultural, professional and exhibition purposes'.|$|E
5|$|Despite this {{development}} work, {{a move to}} a shared stadium in Straiton was again proposed in 2003. Hibs hoped that selling the Easter Road site {{would allow them to}} clear their debts and reduce costs. Club director Rod Petrie commented that any decision would be based on financial grounds and after consultation with the fanbase, as the club were not being forced to move. Farmer expressed support for further redeveloping Easter Road, if it could be part of a viable business plan. During the consultation, Farmer said that his main priority was ensuring the club's survival and denied that any deal had been concluded. The consultation found that the fans were largely opposed to the Straiton proposal, which the club eventually abandoned. To remove part of the debt, the club sold some land to the east of the stadium that had previously been used <b>for</b> <b>car</b> parking. Selling players, including Steven Whittaker, Scott Brown, Kevin Thomson and Steven Fletcher, also funded these debts and further work.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, {{which took place}} in dry weather conditions for most of the 90-minute period and became wet when rain fell in the closing stages which prevented any drivers from improving on their fastest times, Brendon Hartley in Porsche's No. 1 car set an early lap time of one minute and 39.655 seconds which remained the fastest time {{for the remainder of the}} session. He was 1.6 seconds quicker than Romain Dumas in the team's No. 2 entry, who in turn, was two-tenths of a second faster than Loïc Duval in the No. 8 Audi. A LMGTE car impacted Dumas, causing him to spin into the turn seven gravel trap, and sustained damage to his car's right-rear tyre, causing the deployment of a full course yellow flag. He was extracted from the gravel trap and drove back to the pit lane <b>for</b> <b>car</b> repairs. Jonny Kane in the No. 36 Signatech Alpine was the fastest driver in LMP2 with a time of one minute and 49.632 seconds set in the session's closing minutes, nearly one-tenth of a second in front of Jakes. LMGTE Pro was led by James Calado in the No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari 488 GTE, while Carroll's Gulf Racing car was fastest in LMGTE Am, despite driving off the track in the session's closing minutes.|$|E

5|$|Nordberg {{was part}} of Holmenkolbanen's {{operating}} network until 1975, when the municipality of Oslo bought all the company's stock. In the early 1990s, the stations on the Sognsvann Line were upgraded to metro standard, which involves a heightening and lengthening of the platforms, installation of third rail power supply and a new signaling system. The third rail {{made it impossible to}} cross the line in-grade, and under- or overpasses had to be built at all stations. The transport authorities decided to close Nordberg, arguing that the access roads to the station were steep and dangerous, and icy during the winter. The residents of Nordberg opposed the closure of the station, arguing that it had served the area well with its central position in the area. Nevertheless, the station was closed, along with the level crossing that formerly had allowed <b>for</b> <b>car</b> traffic to cross the tracks. An underpass for pedestrians was constructed.|$|E
