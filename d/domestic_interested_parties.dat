50|$|In the IS-LM model, the <b>domestic</b> <b>interest</b> rate {{is a key}} {{component}} in keeping both the money market and the goods market in equilibrium. Under the Mundell-Fleming framework of a small economy facing perfect capital mobility, the <b>domestic</b> <b>interest</b> rate is fixed and equilibrium in both markets can only be maintained by adjustments of the nominal exchange rate or the money supply (by international funds flows).|$|R
40|$|The authors {{analyze the}} dynamic {{adjustment}} {{of the real}} exchange rate, the <b>domestic</b> <b>interest</b> rate, and foreign borrowing under conditions of perfect and imperfect capital mobility during financial liberalization. Making use of a two-sector model with current and capital accounts interacting, they show that the <b>domestic</b> <b>interest</b> rate is more volatile under imperfect mobility and the real exchange rate more volatile under perfect mobility. So liberalizing the capital accounts does not eliminate variations in the <b>domestic</b> <b>interest</b> rate but shifts them to the real exchange rate. Studying data for Chile {{during the period of}} financial liberalization from 1975 to 1982, they found that the <b>domestic</b> <b>interest</b> rate became less volatile and less responsive to domestic variables - and more dependent on the covered international interest rate, while the real exchange rate became more responsive to domestic wealth. Foreign reserve holdings and net exports followed a similar pattern: the covered international rate had stronger effects on reserve changes while real wealth became more important for determining net exports.

40|$|The authors analyze macrodynamic {{adjustment}} during financial liberalization in Chile and New Zealand. During {{the adjustment}} to more open capital accounts {{in the late}} 1970 s or mid- 1980 s, both countries experienced appreciation of the real exchange rate and a collapse of net exports, while <b>domestic</b> <b>interest</b> rates slowly converged to international levels. The authors develop and estimate a two-sector dynamic model using both current and time-varying parameters. They find the <b>domestic</b> <b>interest</b> rate to be more responsive to shocks under imperfect capital mobility, the real exchange rate more responsive under perfect capital mobility. In short, liberalization of the capital account does not eliminate volatility but rather shifts it from the <b>domestic</b> <b>interest</b> rate to the real exchange rate.

40|$|In this study, {{we examine}} the effects of a shock in foreign {{interest}} rate on the macroeconomic performance of Turkey. We use two different structural vector autoregression models (SVAR) and specify them differently for the pre and post 2001 : 6 period. Based on the results of the SVAR models we conclude that, for the period before 2001 : 6 a positive foreign interest rate shock appreciates the real exchange rate, decreases the inflation rate, the <b>domestic</b> <b>interest</b> rate and the income. This last effect occurs when the <b>domestic</b> <b>interest</b> rates are excluded from the model, but when they are included the effect on income is positive. After 2001 : 6, we find that the real exchange rate depreciates, the income decreases, the inflation rate, and the <b>domestic</b> <b>interest</b> rate increases; although this last effect is very small. ...|$|R

40|$|An {{economic}} scenario {{has been}} considered where the government seeks to achieve a favourable balance-of-payments over a fixed planning horizon through exchange rate policy {{and control of the}} <b>domestic</b> <b>interest</b> rate. The dynamics of such an economy was considered in terms of a bounded optimal control problem where the exchange rate is the state variable and the <b>domestic</b> <b>interest</b> rate is the control variable. The idea of balance-of-payments was used as a theoretical underpinning to specify the objective function. By assuming that, changes in exchange rates were induced by two effects: the impact of the <b>domestic</b> <b>interest</b> rate on the exchange rate and the exchange rate system adopted by the government. Instances for both fixed and flexible optimal exchange rate regimes have been determined. The use of the approach has been illustrated employing data obtained from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) statistical bulletin. (original abstract...|$|R

This paper set out a framework for evaluating {{the conditions under which}} an increase in <b>domestic</b> <b>interest</b> rates fails to reverse capital outflow. The possibility that high <b>domestic</b> <b>interest</b> rates might have unorthodox effects arises through a risk premium: If raising interest rates increases the possibility associated with default, the result can be a worsening of the country's capital account position.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} whether the <b>domestic</b> <b>interest</b> rate or the exchange rate affect the sovereign credit default swaps. To date most studies on corporate CDS markets have emphasised the importance of domestic factors such as the interest rate. But with the sovereign CDS market, the international environment also needs to be incorporated into any analysis. Using a VAR and Granger non-causality tests, the results suggest that it is the exchange rate that has the most important effect on sovereign CDS markets, with <b>domestic</b> <b>interest</b> rates having only a marginal effect. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzed}} {{the impact of}} United States (US) monetary shocks on the economies of selected East Asian countries using a structural vector autoregression model. We found that the impacts of the US monetary shocks on <b>domestic</b> <b>interest</b> rates and exchange rates contradict conventional wisdom. The conventional exchange rate channel is unlikely to play much role in the transmission of US monetary policy shocks to floating exchange rate regimes in East Asian countries, excluding Japan. In these countries, the <b>domestic</b> <b>interest</b> rate responds strongly to US interest rate changes, largely by authorities giving up monetary autonomy due to fear of floating. On the other hand, the <b>domestic</b> <b>interest</b> rate does not respond much to changes in US rates in the countries with a fixed exchange rate regime and capital account restrictions, such as the People's Republic of China and Malaysia. This may suggest that the countries with a fixed exchange rate regime enjoy {{a higher degree of}} monetary autonomy, probably with the help of capital account restrictions...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyze the role of fiscal policy sustainability over the determinants of <b>domestic</b> <b>interest</b> rate of a group of 23 emerging market countries in the period 1996 - 2008. Among the analyzed countries are: South Africa, Argentina, Brazil,Bulgaria, Chile, China, Colombia, Egypt, Ecuador, Philippines, Hungry, India, Indonesia,Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Poland, Russia, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine and Venezuela. We have used several <b>domestic</b> <b>interest</b> rates from two databases: 1) IFS:Government Bond Yield, Deposit Rate, Discount Rate/BankRate, Treasury Bill Rate, Money Market Rate; and 2) JPMorgan (2006) : yield of JPMorgan Government Bond Index- Emerging Markets. Fiscal policy sustainability was based on F 1 vero and Giavazzi (2004), and known as the accumulation of primary budget surplus, that keeps the debt-to-gdp ratio constant. The main result shows that is not possible to reject the hypothesis that fiscal policy sustainability determines the level of <b>domestic</b> <b>interest</b> rate and the effect has the expected signal, i. e., an increase in 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper compares {{different}} {{measures of}} Brazilian Country Risk {{from the end}} of 2009 to the beginning of 2012. These measures are derived: 1) from the spread of the internationally issued sovereign bonds interest rates over the U. S. Treasury Bonds rates of return; and, 2) from the residual difference between the expected <b>domestic</b> <b>interest</b> rates (SWAP DI-Pre) and the sum of the forward premium with an identically time-framed American interest rate. In the same period, an analysis of the financial flows dynamics using an ARCH modeling showed {{a significant increase in the}} volatility of the Foreign Direct Investments (FDI). This period coincided with: 1) an increase of the FDI flows, which surpassed the Portfolio Investments; 2) the existence of an embedded quasi-rent in the financial applications, associated with the high levels of <b>domestic</b> <b>interest</b> rates; 3) increases in the taxation (Financial Transaction Tax – IOF, in Brazil) of Portfolio Investments; and, 4) a profound decline in Portfolio Investments. Therefore, there is evidence of a regulatory arbitrage movement in the period, which can be explained by the existence of quasi-rents embedded in <b>domestic</b> <b>interest</b> rates. In other words, we found evidence of speculative capital inflows in the Brazilian economy disguised as FDI. The paper supports a <b>domestic</b> <b>interest</b> rate path convergent to the prevailing levels in the international financial markets, according to the Covered Interest Parity and the norma...|$|R

Some studies find that net capital inflows reduce <b>domestic</b> <b>interest</b> rates, whereas others find no such impact. The present study, which applies cointegration techniques to quarterly data over the 1973 - 93 period, finds that such capital inflows to a major industrialized nation, France, may not only reduce longer term interest rates in that nation but may also offset {{a large portion of the}} longer term interest rate impact of that nation's government budget deficit. ...|$|R
