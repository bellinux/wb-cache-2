40|$|Photoinduced {{electron}} transfer plays key roles {{in many areas}} of chemistry. Superexchange is an effective model to rationalize photoinduced {{electron transfer}}, particularly when molecular bridges between donor and acceptor subunits are present. In this tutorial review we discuss, within a superexchange framework, the complex role played by the bridge, with an emphasis on differences between thermal and photoinduced electron transfer, oxidative and reductive photoinduced processes, charge separation and charge recombination. Modular bridges are also considered, with specific attention to the distance dependence of donor–acceptor electronic coupling and electron transfer rate constants. The possibility of transition, depending on the bridge energetics, from coherent <b>donor–acceptor</b> <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> to incoherent charge injection and hopping through the bridge is also discussed. Finally, conceptual analogies between bridge effects in photoinduced electron transfer and optical intervalence transfer are outlined. Selected experimental examples, instrumental to illustration of the principles, are discusse...|$|E
40|$|A {{model of}} the {{distance}} dependence of photoinduced <b>donor-acceptor</b> <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> in DNA is presented that includes the distance dependence of the solvent reorganization energy and free energy in the heterogeneous DNA environment. DNA is modeled as a low dielectric region that represents the base stack and two regions with more moderate dielectric properties that represent the DNA backbone. The DNA {{is surrounded by a}} high dielectric medium, which represents water. Model calculations show the importance of including the reorganization energy and the free energy change and illustrate the differences between the inhomogeneous model and homogeneous single dielectric constant calculations using standard Marcus theory. Calculations are performed for comparison to published experimental work (Science 1997, 277, 673; 1 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992, 114, 3656 2). Fits to one set of data 2 permit the previously reported distance dependence to be separated into an electronic contribution and solvent reorganization energy and free energy contributions. For the other set of data, 1 inclusion of the solvent reorganization energy and free energy distance dependences in the analysis of the overall distance dependent data suggest that the Marcus form of the distance dependent rate constant including the Marcus reorganization energy is not consistent with the data.

40|$|Spectral hole {{burning and}} photon echoes are the {{techniques}} for frequency-selective optical memories, {{which have the}} potential to increase areal data storage density by a factor 10 ** 7. They also have the capability to perform in-memory data processing. In this thesis, several materials and techniques for optical memories in the frequency- and time domain have been investigated. In the frequency domain, ways to increase the storage density and the working temperature were studied using photon-gated spectral hole burning materials of the metal-tetrabenzoporphyrin derivatives. A selection rule for the electron acceptors in the <b>donor-acceptor</b> <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> systems was deduced. By doping the material with two different donors a maximum inhomogeneous line width of more than 30 THz was achieved. A polarization holographic technique was established for the formation and detection of spectral holes. Our results indicate that this technique can provide a better signal-to-noise ratio than that achieved by a conventional holographic technique, in particular for samples of poor optical quality. In the time domain, magnetic field-induced and the intensity-induced dephasing processes were studied in Pr 3 + doped in a YAlO 3 crystal and a Y 2 SiO 5 crystal, respectively. As a step along the route to make photon echo based optical processing possible, the amplification of photon echo signals by the use of a fiber amplifier (Pr 3 +-doped ZBLAN) was demonstrated. A gain of 45 was achieved. The erasure of stored data using photon echoes has also been investigated. A technique to diagnose the phase and frequency stability of a light source by the photon echo erasure process was proposed and illustrated. An approach to bit-selective data erasure, that is free from laser phase and frequency fluctuations, is also suggested. A concept for an arbitrary shape pulse generator based on photon echoes and hole-burning was experimentally and theoretically studied. Finally, a comparison between the properties and capabilities of spectral hole burning and photon echoes was made...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with quantum dynamical propagation methods suitable for high-dimensional systems, and their application to excitation energy transfer (EET), electron transfer (ET), and intra-molecular vibrational redistribution (IVR) in molecular aggregates. The theoretical description of these processes, which are often ultrafast – with time scales {{in the range of}} femtoseconds to picoseconds – is challenging, both with regard to quantum dynamical simulations and electronic structure calculations. The present thesis comprises two parts. The first part concerns the implementation of a novel quantum dynamical method based on Gaussian Wavepackets (GWPs) : the 2 -Layer Gaussian-MCTDH (2 L-GMCTDH) method. This method, which has recently been proposed in [S. Römer, M. Ruckenbauer, I. Burghardt, The Journal of Chemical Physics, 2013, 138, 064106] was implemented in a Fortran 90 code and applied to various high-dimensional test systems. The second part of the thesis addresses the combined electronic structure and dynamical study of a novel type of donor-acceptor systems that have been investigated in a joint project with experimental collaboration partners at Strasbourg University. In both parts, numerical applications focus on high-dimensional model Hamiltonians for EET and ET processes. Regarding the first part, the interest of using GWP-based methods is two-fold: First, GWPs represent spatially localized basis sets that are useful for on-the-fly dynamics in conjunction with electronic structure calculations. Second, they are naturally suited for the explicit representation of quantum mechanical system-bath type problems where a large number of vibrational bath modes are weakly perturbed from equilibrium. In this context, various methods exist that are based upon classically evolving GWP bases. A major improvement results from variational methods which involve optimized, non-classical GWP trajectories. In particular, the variational Gaussian-based Multi-Configuration Time-Dependent Hartree (GMCTDH) and its variational Multi-Configurational Gaussians (vMCG) variant were originally derived as semiclassical variants of the Multi-Configuration Time-Dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method. However, the G-MCTDH and vMCG methods mostly use Frozen Gaussian (FG) basis sets that are far less flexible than the single-particle (SPF) representation of standard MCTDH. As a consequence, a significantly larger number of GWPs are generally required to reach convergence. To remedy the lack of flexibility of the FG basis sets, the abovementioned two-layer (2 L-G-MCTDH) approach has been introduced: Here, the first layer is composed of flexible SPFs, while the second layer is composed of low-dimensional FGs. The numerical scaling properties are significantly improved as compared with the conventional G-MCTDH and vMCG schemes. The first implementation of the method in an in-house Fortran 90 code is presented, along with applications to (i) a model of site-to-site vibrational energy flow in the presence of intra-site vibrational energy redistribution (IVR) and (ii) a multidimensional <b>donor-acceptor</b> <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> system described within a linear vibronic coupling model. The second system relates to a model for ET at an oligothiophene-fullerene interface relevant to organic photovoltaics. Besides the description of the implementation, a detailed assessment of the convergence properties and comparison with multi-layer MCTDH (ML-MCTDH) benchmark calculations is presented. Finally, a perspective is given on the future combination with the existing ML-MCTDH scheme; indeed, such a combination is straightforward since the first layer of the 2 L-G-MCTDH approach can be chosen to be orthogonal. Regarding {{the second part of the}} thesis, two generations of a novel donor-acceptor (DA) system for organic photovoltaics applications, involving self-assembled block co-oligomers DA dyads and triads with perylene-diimide (PDI) accepter units, are addressed within a collaborative project with S. Haacke and S. Mery (University of Strasbourg). Based upon detailed excited-state electronic structure investigations along with quantum dynamical and kinetic studies, the relevant ET formation and recombination steps are characterized quantitatively, in view of optimizing the chemical design and reducing recombination losses. In a first-generation variant of the abovementioned DA systems, which involves liquid-crystalline triads, we were able to show that a highly efficient inter-chain ET process prevails over intra-molecular ET, leading to fast recombination. Due to the latter, this system turns out to be inefficient for photovoltaic applications. To fully understand the elementary steps, high-dimensional quantum dynamics simulations were carried out using the ML-MCTDH method, in collaboration with Matthias Polkehn from our group. In the second-generation variant, which is in the focus of the present thesis, both the nanomorphology and the chemical design were modified. The present work, focuses upon the aspect of chemical design, by characterizing a series of modified DA’s, with donor units of varying length while the PDI accepter units remain unchanged. The intra-molecular ET is observed in these systems, but the processes are comparatively slow, of the order of tens to hundreds of picoseconds. Hence, a kinetic analysis using the Marcus-Levich-Jortner rate theory is employed. Among the main results of the study is that addition of an electron donating amine unit strongly increases the lifetime of the charge-separated state, and therefore reduced recombination losses. Overall, the present thesis shows how a combination of high-dimensional quantum dynamics, electronic structure calculations, and vibronic coupling model Hamiltonians can be employed to obtain an accurate picture of EET, ET, and IVR in high-dimensional molecular assemblies. Furthermore, the 2 L-GMCTDH method paves the way for accurate and efficient on-the-fly calculations; a suitable set-up for such calculations is currently in progress. Diese Arbeit befasst sich einerseits mit neuen methodischen Entwicklungen im Bereich der hochdimensionalen Quantendynamik und andererseits mit der kombinierten Anwendung von Quantendynamiksimulationen und elektronischen Strukturrechnungen an hochdimensionalen molekularen Systemen. Im Anwendungsteil dieser Arbeit liegt der Fokus auf Energie- und Ladungstransferprozessen, sowie der intra-molekularen Verteilung von Schwingungsenergie in molekularen Aggregaten. Energie- und Ladungstransferprozesse spielen eine wichtige Rolle in vielen reaktiven Prozessen der Chemie, Biologie und Physik. Diese treten sowohl in isolierten Molekülen, als auch molekularen Aggregaten, wie Lichtsammelkomplexen und photo-aktiven organischen Materialien, auf. Typische Zeitskalen dieser Transferprozesse befinden sich im ultra-schnellen Bereich von Femto- bis Pikosekunden. Die vorliegende Arbeit ist in zwei Themenbereiche gegliedert. Der erste Teil behandelt die Implementierung einer neuartigen Quantendynamikmethode, welche Gaußsche Wellenpakete (GWP) als Basis nutzt, die sogenannte 2 -Layer-Gaussian-Multi-Configuration Time-Dependent Hartree (2 L-G-MCTDH) -Methode. Diese Methode, die auf einer hierarchischen Darstellung der Wellenfunktion beruht, wurde in [S. Römer, M. Ruckenbauer, I. Burghardt, The Journal of Chemical Physics, 2013, 138, 064106] vorgeschlagen und in der vorliegenden Arbeit in einem Fortran 90 -Code umgesetzt. Anhand dieses Codes wurden erste Anwendungen an hochdimensionalen Systemen durchgeführt. Der zweite Teil dieser Arbeit befasst sich mit der Untersuchung eines neuartigen Typs von Donor-Akzeptor-Systemen mittels einer Kombination von elektronischen Strukturrechnungen, Quantendynamiksimulationen und kinetischen Simulationen. Diese Untersuchung ist Teil einer DFG/ANR-Kooperation mit den Arbeitsgruppen von Prof. S. Haacke und Dr. S. Méry (Universität Straßburg). Beide Teile konzentrieren sich auf Energie- und Ladungstransferprozesse in hochdimensionalen Systemen. Der zweite Abschnitt dieser Arbeit befasst sich mit zwei Generationen eines neuartigen Donor-Akzeptor Systems zur Anwendung in der organischen Photovoltaik, das wie oben erwähnt in den Straßburger Arbeitsgruppen von S. Méry und S. Haacke entwickelt wurde. Die relevanten Systeme basieren auf selbst-assemblierenden Co-Oligomer Donor-Akzeptor-Dyaden und -Triaden, die eine Perylendiimid-Akzeptor-Einheit verwenden. Detaillierte elektronische Strukturrechnungen, insbesondere auch für angeregte Zustände, dienen als Basis für quantendynamische und kinetische Untersuchungen, um die relevanten Ladungsseparations- und- Rekombinationsschritte quantitativ zu beschreiben. Die Optimierung dieser Schritte durch ein geeignetes chemisches Design der Donor-Akzeptor-Komponenten steht im Vordergrund dieser Studie. Dabei sollen insbesondere Rekombinationsverluste reduziert werden. Bezüglich der ersten Generation des Donor-Akzeptor-Systems wurde gezeigt, dass ein hocheffizienter inter-molekularer Ladungstransfer gegenüber dem intramolekularen Ladungstransfer innerhalb einer Donor-Akzeptor-Dyade oder -Triade deutlich bevorzugt ist. Obwohl dies zu einer ultra-schnellen initialen Ladungstrennung führt, erweist sich das System jedoch als ineffizient für die Nutzung in der Photovoltaik. Dies ist darauf zurückzuführen, dass aufgrund der dreidimensionalen Stapelanordnung des Donor-Akzeptor-Systems die relevanten Transferintegrale gegenüber der Rekombinationsrate vernachlässigbar sind. Eine quantendynamische Analyse entstand in Kooperation mit Matthias Polkehn und umfasste hochdimensionale Quantendynamiksimulationen mittels der ML-MCTDH-Methode. Die vorliegende Arbeit konzentriert sich vor allem auf die zweite Generation der Donor-Akzeptor-Materialen, bei der sowohl die Nanomorphologie als auch das chemische Design modifiziert wurden. In dieser Arbeit liegt der Fokus auf letzterem Aspekt, wobei eine systematische Untersuchung von einer Reihe modifizierter Donor-Akzeptor-Varianten durchgeführt wurde. Die beobachteten Ladungstransferprozesse in diesen Systemen sind allerdings vergleichsweise langsam - im Bereich von hunderten Pikosekunden - weshalb eine kinetische Analyse mit Hilfe der Marcus-Jortner-Levich Theorie angewendet wurde. Ein wesentliches Ergebnis dieser Studie zeigt, dass durch die Einführung einer Amin-Gruppe die Lebensdauer der ladungsseparierten Zustände stark verlängert und daher die Ladungsrekombinationen deutlich reduziert wird. Zusammenfassend zeigt diese Arbeit, dass eine Kombination von hochdimensionalen Quantendynamiksimulationen, elektronischen Strukturrechnungen und paramerisierten Modellen ein detailliertes Bild von Energie- und Ladungstransferprozessen in hochdimensionalen molekularen Aggregaten liefern kann. Mit Blick auf die verwendeten quantendynamischen Methoden ist weiterhin hervorzuheben, dass die neue 2 L-G-MCTDH-Methode im Rahmen dieser Arbeit erstmalig implementiert wurde. Neben ersten Anwendungen auf parametrisierte Modelle ebnet diese Methode den Weg für genaue und effiziente on-the-fly Rechnungen. Eine entsprechende Erweiterung der aktuellen Implementierung ist momentan in Arbeit...|$|E

Altering the growth rate did result in changes in biomass yield, but not in other key physiological parameters including the total cytochrome content of the cells, the production of extracellular flavin redox shuttles or {{the potential of the}} organism to reduce the azo dye. Dramatic increases in the ability to reduce the dye were noted when cells were grown under conditions of electron acceptor (fumarate) limitation, although the yields of extracellular redox mediators (flavins) were similar under conditions of electron donor (lactate) or acceptor limitation. FT-IR spectroscopy confirmed shifts in the metabolic fingerprints of cells grown under these contrasting conditions, while spectrophotometric analyses supported a critical role for c-type cytochromes, expressed at maximal concentrations under conditions of electron acceptor limitation. Finally, key intracellular metabolites were quantified in batch experiments at various electron donor and acceptor ratios and analysed using discriminant analysis and a Bayesian network to construct a central metabolic pathway model for cells grown under conditions of electron donor or acceptor limitation.

We estimate the energy efficiency of the <b>donor-acceptor</b> <b>electron</b> transport depending on the parameter values.

40|$|In this Thesis, porphyrin-based donor-acceptor {{systems have}} been used to study {{photoinduced}} <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> processes. Principally, two different sets of {{systems have been}} investigated. The first is a series in which a ferrocene-fullerene donor-acceptor couple is bridged by conjugated zinc porphyrin oligomers (Fc-Pn-C 60, n = 1, 2, 4), and the second is a system containing a zinc porphyrin donor connected by a secondary electron acceptor to a gold(III) porphyrin primary acceptor. Strong inter-porphyrin conjugation in the oligomer series was achieved by using a butadiyne-link. This link allows for a broad distribution of dihedral conformations, which has important effects on the photophysical properties of the oligomers. The ground-state absorption spectrum is in effect an average of all dihedral conformations. The photophysics of the dimer was studied extensively, and {{it was found that the}} perpendicular and planar conformations can be addressed selectively. It was furthermore found that the ground-state barrier for rotation is approximately 0. 7 kcal/mol (BLYP/ 6 - 31 G(d)), whereas there is a strong bias towards the planar conformation in the excited state. Conformation is critical for the electronic coupling between the porphyrin macro-cycles and has significant effect on the <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> properties of these systems. By using the dimer as electron donor, considerable control over the <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> rate can be exercised by selective excitation of planar or perpendicular conformations. The main objective for investigating the series of conjugated porphyrin oligomers was to establish how suitable they are for use in future molecular electronic applications. This was done by photo excitation of the Pn-bridge, which results in the charge separated state Fc+-Pn-C 60  by a sequence of <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> steps. The subsequent charge recombination was then monitored. It was found that the oligomers mediate charge very efficiently at distances up to 65 Å for n = 4 with remarkably weak distance dependence. The conformational flexibility of these systems has important implications for the mediation of electronic coupling, as this is expected to be a strong function of porphyrin-porphyrin dihedral angle. It was found that the charge recombination rate increased by an order of magnitude when Fc-P 2 -C 60 was constrained to a planar conformation by the addition of a bi dentate ligand. Further, as a part of this study, the triplet energies of the oligomers were determined. In the second set of <b>donor-acceptor</b> systems, two <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> processes are viable: a direct, long-range <b>electron</b> <b>transfer,</b> and a sequential <b>electron</b> <b>transfer.</b> High solvent polarity stabilises an intermediary state, where the electron is localised on the anthracene-based bridge unit, which thus serves as a secondary electron acceptor. It is shown in this work that the two mechanisms operate in parallel, and moreover, that the direct <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> is faster than the sequential mechanism by approximately a factor of two, at room temperature. As the temperature dependence of the sequential mechanism is stronger than that of the direct mechanism, temperature served as an important means to control the competition. In butyronitrile, the sequential mechanism was essentially switched off relative to the direct <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> at low temperatures...|$|R

In the figures at the lower left, symmetric perylene bisimide dimers connected by oligophenylene bridges of varying length show fluorescence quenching due to photoinduced intramolecular <b>electron</b> <b>transfer.</b> Solution and single-molecule fluorescence experiments, along with theoretical modeling, {{have been used to}} study this <b>electron</b> <b>transfer,</b> which is found to depend on both the distance and relative orientation between the two chromophores...|$|R

40|$|<b>Electron</b> <b>transfer</b> {{reactions}} through Donor-Bridge-Acceptor (DBA) molecules {{are important}} as they constitute a fundamental chemical process and are of intrinsic importance in biology, chemistry, and the emerging field of nanotechnology. <b>Electron</b> <b>transfer</b> reactions proceed generally {{in a few}} limiting regimes; nonadiabatic <b>electron</b> <b>transfer,</b> adiabatic <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> and solvent controlled <b>electron</b> <b>transfer.</b> This study is going to address two different regimes (nonadiabatic and solvent controlled) of <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> studies. In the nonadiabatic limit, {{we are going to}} explore how the electron tunneling kinetics of different donor-bridge-acceptor molecules depends on tunneling barrier. Different parameters like free energy, reorganization energy, and electronic coupling which govern the <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> were quantitatively evaluated and compared with theoretical models. In the solvent controlled limit we have shown that a change of <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> mechanism happens and the kinetics dominantly depends on solvent polarization response. This study comprises of two different kinds of Donor-Bridge-acceptor molecules, one having a pendant group present in the cleft between the donor and acceptor hanging from the bridge and the other having no group present in the cleft. The <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> kinetics critically depend on the pendant unit present in the cavity between the donor and the acceptor moieties. The electronic character of the pendant unit can tune the electronic coupling between the donor and the acceptor. If the cavity is empty then solvent molecule(s) can occupy the cavity and can influence the <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> rate between donor and acceptor. It has been shown that water molecules can change the <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> pathways in proteins. This study has experimentally shown that few water molecules can change the <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> rate significantly by forming a hydrogen bonded structure between them. Understanding the issues outlined in this work are important for understanding and controlling electron motion in supramolecular structures and the encounter complex of reactants. For example, the efficiency of electron tunneling through water molecules is essential to a mechanistic understanding of important biological processes, such as bioenergetics. Also, the influence of friction and its role in changing the reaction mechanism should enhance our understanding for how nuclear motions affect long range <b>electron</b> <b>transfer...</b>|$|R
40|$|Mechanistic {{aspects of}} some of the early <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> steps {{occurring}} in photosynthetic reaction centers are discussed. Starting from the normal modes of the redox cofactors involved in the <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> processes, we show how a series of quantities which regulate <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> rates, such as (i) the <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> active modes, (ii) the intramolecular reorganization energy, and (iii) the mutual couplings between the vibronic states of the donor and the acceptor, can be obtained and used to draw qualitative conclusions on ET rates. © Springer-Verlag 2007...|$|R

This ground-state <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> allowed for the accurate measurement of the resistances of individual carbon-based molecules.|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> reaction, QA−⋅QB → QAQB−⋅, was studied in isolated reaction centers from the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides by replacing the native Q 10 in the QA binding site with quinones having different redox potentials. These substitutions are expected to change the intrinsic <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> rate by changing the redox free energy (i. e., driving force) for <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> without affecting other events that {{may be associated with}} the <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> (e. g., protein dynamics or protonation). The <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> from QA−⋅ to QB was measured by three independent methods: a functional assay involving cytochrome c 2 to measure the rate of QA−⋅ oxidation, optical kinetic spectroscopy to measure changes in semiquinone absorption, and kinetic near-IR spectroscopy to measure electrochromic shifts that occur in response to <b>electron</b> <b>transfer.</b> The results show that the rate of the observed <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> from QA−⋅ to QB does not change as the redox free energy for <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> is varied over a range of 150 meV. The strong temperature dependence of the observed rate rules out the possibility that the reaction is activationless. We conclude, therefore, that the independence of the observed rate on the driving force for <b>electron</b> <b>transfer</b> is due to conformational gating, that is, the rate limiting step is a conformational change required before <b>electron</b> <b>transfer.</b> This change is proposed to be the movement, controlled kinetically either by protein dynamics or intermolecular interactions, of QB by ≈ 5 Å as observed in the x-ray studies of Stowell et al.
