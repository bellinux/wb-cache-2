40|$|High and {{volatile}} food prices pose a significant policy challenge around the world, {{and an understanding}} of the dynamics of food price inflation and volatility is essential in designing appropriate policy responses. Using the panel data for 72 countries from 2000 to 2011, the paper assesses the international transmission of food price inflation and volatilities as well as the effects of various internal and external factors on <b>domestic</b> food price <b>inflation</b> and volatility. The paper offers evidence in support of the international transmission of food price inflation and volatility. Specifically, the paper finds that the <b>domestic</b> food price <b>inflation</b> in Asia is strongly associated with the lagged value of global food price inflation (using the FAO food price index), while volatility spillovers from global to domestic food prices are rather contemporaneous. The paper also finds that both national food price inflation rates and volatilities are strongly associated with both intra- and extra- regional food price inflation rates and volatilities, respectively. The findings also suggest that higher economic growth rates, greater shares of food in merchandise imports, and smaller increases in the share of food in merchandise imports lead to lower <b>domestic</b> food price <b>inflation.</b> An appreciation of local currency, greater political stability, and higher income level are also found to lower <b>domestic</b> food price <b>inflation.</b> On the other hand, higher economic growth rates lead to lower volatilities of food prices...|$|R

50|$|Inflation in India {{generally}} {{occurs as}} a consequence of global traded commodities and the several efforts made by The Reserve Bank of India to weaken rupee against dollar. This was done after the Pokhran Blasts in 1998. This has been regarded as the root cause of inflation crisis rather than the <b>domestic</b> <b>inflation.</b> According to some experts the policy of RBI to absorb all dollars coming into the Indian Economy contributes to the appreciation of the rupee. When the US dollar has shrieked by a margin of 30%, Reserve Bank of India had made a massive injection of dollar in the economy make it highly liquid and this further triggered off inflation in non-traded goods. The RBI picture clearly portrays for subsidizing exports with a weak dollar-exchange rate.All these account for a dangerous inflationary policies being followed by the central bank of the country. Further, on account of cheap products being imported in the country which are made on a high technological and capital intensive techniques happen to either increase the price of domestic raw materials in the global market or they are forced to sell at a cheaper price, hence fetching heavy losses.|$|E

50|$|In the 1980s, the {{government}} played a simultaneous {{role as a}} legislator, regulator, and entrepreneur, particularly {{in the provision of}} public utilities and in the exploitation of major natural resources, such as oil and coal. Colombia also used diverse trade-policy tools, such as tariffs and quotas, in order to promote import substitution, supplemented after 1967 by export promotion and economic diversification. To encourage exports, a competitive exchange rate became a centerpiece of macroeconomic policy, together with several export subsidies, including tax exemptions and subsidized credit. The initial export-promotion strategy did not include import liberalization as one of its components. A prominent feature of the export-promotion strategy was that the Bank of the Republic stood ready to vary the fixed but adjustable exchange rate to compensate for <b>domestic</b> <b>inflation,</b> {{in order to maintain the}} competitiveness of domestic producers. As a result, the exchange rate became indexed to the rate of inflation, and it did not take long for a vicious circle to develop, one in which inflation fed into the exchange rate and vice versa. Consequently, and notwithstanding a tradition of prudent fiscal policies, for a long period Colombia was characterized by a moderate, albeit stable, rate of inflation. Widespread indexation mechanisms, particularly for wages, public utilities, and mortgage-interest rates, blurred most income-redistribution effects generally associated with inflation.|$|E

A compromise was reached: Brazil would become a parliamentary democracy, with Goulart as President. As such, he would be head of state, but with limited powers of head of government. Tancredo Neves was named as the new prime minister.On January 6, 1963, Goulart successfully changed the system of government back to presidential democracy in a referendum won by a large margin.
