60|$|Now, {{when the}} coco-nut has {{actually}} reached {{the ground at}} last, and proceeds to sprout in the spot where chance (perhaps in the bodily shape of a disappointed monkey) has chosen to cast it, these numerous safeguards and solid envelopes naturally begin to prove decided nuisances to the embryo within. It starts under the great disadvantage of being hermetically sealed within a solid wooden shell, so that no water can possibly get at it to aid it as most other seeds are aided {{in the process of}} germination. Fancy yourself a seed-pea, anxious to sprout, but coated all round with a <b>hard</b> <b>covering</b> of impermeable sealing-wax, and you will be in a position faintly to appreciate the unfortunate predicament of a grower coco-nut. Natural selection, however--that deus ex machinâ of modern science, which can perform such endless wonders, if only you give it time enough to work in and variations enough to work upon--natural selection has come to the rescue of the unhappy plant by leaving it a little hole {{at the top of the}} shell, out of which it can push its feathery green head without difficulty. Everybody knows that if you look at the sharp end of a coco-nut you will see three little brown pits or depressions on its surface. Most people also know that two of these are firmly stopped up (for a reason to which I shall presently recur), but that the third one is only closed by a slight film or very thin shell, which can be easily bored through with a pocket knife, so as to let the milk run off before cracking the shell. So much we have all learnt during our ardent pursuit of natural knowledge on half-holidays in early life. But we probably then failed to observe that just opposite this soft hole lies a small roundish knob, imbedded in the pulp or eatable portion, which knob is in fact the embryo palm or seedling, for whose ultimate benefit the whole arrangement (in brown and green) has been invented. That is very much the way with man: he notices what concerns his own appetite, and omits all the really important parts of the whole subject. We think the use of the hole is to let out the milk; but the nut knows that its real object is to let out the seedling. The knob grows out at last into the young plantlet, and it is by means of the soft hole that it makes its escape through the shell to the air and the sunshine which it seeks without. This brings us really down at last to the true raison d'être for the milk in the coco-nut. As the seed or kernel cannot easily get at much water from outside, it has a good supply of water laid up for it ready beforehand within its own encircling shell. The mother liquid from which the pulp or nutty part has been deposited remains in the centre, as the milk, till the tiny embryo begins to sprout. As soon as it does so, the little knob which was at first so very small enlarges rapidly and absorbs the water, till it grows out into a big spongy cellular mass, which at last almost fills up the entire shell. At the same time, its other end pushes its way out through the soft hole, and then gives birth to a growing bud at the top--the future stem and leaves--and to a number of long threads beneath--the future roots. Meanwhile, the spongy mass inside begins gradually to absorb all the nutty part, using up its oils and starches for the purpose of feeding the young plant above, until it is of an age to expand its leaves to the open tropical sunlight and shift for itself in the struggle for life. It seems at first sight very hard to understand how any tissue so solid as the pulp of coco-nut can be thus softened and absorbed without any visible cause; but in the subtle chemistry of living vegetation such a transformation is comparatively simple and easy to perform. Nature sometimes works much greater miracles than this in the same way: for example, what is called vegetable ivory, a substance so solid that it can be carved or turned only with great difficulty, is really the kernel of another palm-nut, allied to the coco-palm, and its very stony particles are all similarly absorbed during germination by the dissolving power of the young seedling.|$|E

40|$|Purpose This work {{intends to}} show whether the Eco-label EU Decision for <b>hard</b> <b>coverings,</b> in which marble is {{contemplated}} among <b>hard</b> <b>coverings</b> {{as a natural}} product, is really capable of capturing the environmental performances of the marble productive chain, in other words whether it is actually viable for the natural products, like marble. Methods After a preliminary critical analysis of the suitability formarble of the current EU Decision (2009 / 607 /EC), a classical life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology has been applied on the field to the marble “Perlato di Sicilia. ” More specifically, the whole productive chain {{of a couple of}} firms treating the “Perlato di Sicilia” marble has been examined. The life cycle analysis is actually a cradle-to-gate analysiswhich includes the raw material extraction, processing phase, and finishing operations. Results and discussion Both the preliminary critical analyses {{of the structure of the}} Decision and the in-field checking on the two firms of the Custonaci marble district in Sicily singled out several conflicting points of the Decision for the marble working chain. These difficulties could be reasonably extended to other natural stones, such as granite, for which similar working processes are applied. Based on the outcomes of both these analyses, in the present work, a set of new indicators and modified criteria, already present in the Decision, is proposed as a candidate to be considered for inclusion in a future release of the Decision. Conclusions The changes here introduced can represent a useful indication toward a more suitable scheme of the EU Eco-label for marble, at least. Clearly, further investigations need to better assess the proposed scheme, especially in terms of threshold values of pollutant releases and use of explosive that are actually specific for the marble productive chain. The present modified version of the standard has been proposed to the Sicilian administration in order to be voluntarily adopted by marble productive sites of the region, in the aim of extensively verifying its suitability...|$|R

[...] If one measures the diameter of a crater, the original depth can be estimated with various ratios. Because of this relationship, researchers have found that many Martian craters contain a great deal of material; much of it is believed to be ice deposited when the climate was different.

40|$|During {{the recent}} years the {{radiation}} of walking noise ("drum sound") of laminate floor coverings has become an important product property for marketing. Producers of floors are optimizing their products using attached underlays to attenuate drum sound, and the EPLF developed a measurement and evaluation procedure in cooperation with research institutes: A modified tapping machine is operating on the sample area laid in a test room with concrete floor and sufficient sound absorption. The stationary sound signal is recorded and post-processed using the Zwicker loudness analysis. The result is an overall loudness value (in Sone) and a diagram of specific loudness where the frequency components of the sound can be assessed. Today, very different types of underlay attachements for drum sound attenuation are in use. The range of materials comprises duroplastic or thermoplastic coatings, more or less stiff thermoplastic mats, recycled plastics, rubber mats, and soft fibre boards. Experiences from measurements for many floor and underlay products carried out at WKI show that the materials can perform very differently. But {{this is not only}} due to the type of underlay of floor material. Drum sound attenuation is a combined effect of laminate properties, thickness and stiffness of the underlay and the laying method. The difference of overall loudness values between "silent" and "loud" products can be up to 25 Sone. Typical for laminate floorings are a lower frequency peak (400 [...] . 1000 Hz) - probably caused by resonance effects between the areas mass of the laminate flooring and the stiffness and thickness of the underlay - and another peak at 2000 [...] . 3000 Hz corresponding to a "rattling" sound from the <b>hard</b> <b>covering.</b> Some products with underlays show a good attenuation of "rattling" sound components, others a shift of the low-frequency components in the spectra. The technical development of material combinations with improved performance is going on. There is still a need for modelling the process of drum sound generation and radiation so that further improvements can be expected...|$|E
