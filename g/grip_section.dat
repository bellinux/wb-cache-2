500|$|In classic {{cross-country}} skiing the skis remain parallel, as the skier strides straight ahead. The undersides of the skis have a <b>grip</b> <b>section</b> {{in the middle}} treated with a special ski wax that provides friction when the foot is still, yet glides when the foot is in motion, {{while the rest of}} the ski bottom has a glide wax. Classic events occur on courses with tracks set by a grooming machine at precise intervals and with carefully planned curvature. Both poles may be used simultaneously ("double-poling") or with alternating foot and arm extended (as with running or walking) with the pole pushing on the side opposite of the extended, sliding ski. In classic skiing the alternating technique is used for the [...] "diagonal stride"—the predominant classic sub-technique. In diagonal-stride legs move like in ordinary walking, but with longer and more powerful steps. Diagonal is useful on level ground and on gentle uphill slopes. Uphill steps are shorter and more frequent. With double-poling both poles are used simultaneously for thrust, which may be augmented with striding. Double-poling is useful on level ground and on gentle downhill slopes. On steep uphills fishbone technique can be used.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Conventional {{ultrasonic}} inspections {{techniques for}} fatigue characterization {{are based on}} linear elasticity. Studies have shown that NDE methods based upon sound velocity and attenuation are more sensitive and reliable after crack formation i. e. 100 % fatigue. In recent years nonlinear acoustics/ ultrasonics has been suggested as a new approach for the effective evaluation {{of a wide range}} of material degradation. In this paper we present results from studies on Titanium samples to quantify LCF, using second harmonics generated during nonlinear ultrasound inspections. Samples were tested to failure and inspected with 5 MHz signals for harmonics. The nonlinearity parameter (β) is evaluated from the measurements of the fundamental and second harmonics. Over 80 % change in the nonlinearity parameter is observed between the gage and the <b>grip</b> <b>sections</b> of the LCF sample, where a conventional ultrasound velocity measurement shows a negligible variation 1...|$|R

40|$|Unlike metals, {{necking in}} {{polymers}} under tension {{does not lead}} to further localization of deformation, but to propagation of the neck along the specimen. Finite element analysis is used to numerically study necking and neck propagation in amorphous glassy polymers under plane strain tension during large strain plastic flow. The constitutive model used in the analyses features strain-rate, pressure, and temperature dependent yield, softening immediately after yield and subsequent orientational hardening with further plastic deformation. The latter is associated with distortion of the underlying molecular network structure of the material, and is modelled here by adopting a recently proposed network theory developed for rubber elasticity. Previous studies of necking instabilities have almost invariably employed idealized prismatic specimens; here, we explicitly account for the unavoidable <b>grip</b> <b>sections</b> of test specimens. The effects of initial imperfections, strain softening, orientation hardening, strain-rate as well as of specimen geometry and boundary conditions are discussed. The physical mechanisms for necking and neck propagation, in terms of our constitutive model, are discussed {{on the basis of a}} detailed parameter study. ...|$|R
50|$|On an , each jaw can {{be moved}} independently. Because they most often have four jaws, the term four-jaw chuck without other {{qualification}} is understood by machinists to mean a chuck with four independent jaws. The independence of the jaws makes these chucks ideal for (a) <b>gripping</b> non-circular cross <b>sections</b> and (b) <b>gripping</b> circular cross <b>sections</b> with extreme precision (when the last few hundredths of a millimeter thousandths of an inch of runout must be manually eliminated). The non-self-centering action of the independent jaws makes centering highly controllable (for an experienced user), but {{at the expense of}} speed and ease. Four-jaw chucks are almost never used for tool holding. Four-jaw chucks can be found on lathes and indexing heads.|$|R

50|$|The {{first was}} the {{inclusion}} of a small grub screw which could be adjusted to allow closer focusing. Unfortunately, the resultant image quality is very soft, and there are also extremely high levels of edge fringing, making the hack unsuitable for conventional video and still image capture. The second of the Iscorama 42ʼs unique features was its ratcheting anamorphic alignment mechanism, which was actuated by sliding the rubber <b>grip</b> <b>section</b> {{at the rear of the}} lens forward by two millimetres. This proved to be inferior to the lockable, free rotating mechanism on other Iscoramas; the ratchet indent spacing being too coarse to allow absolutely precise alignment of the anamorphic when screwed onto a taking lens. The most obvious side effect of this issue is the notable difficulty in achieving perfectly horizontal anamorphic lens flares with the Iscorama 42 when the adapter is attached directly to a taking lens.|$|E

50|$|The Uzi Pro, an {{improved}} {{variant of the}} Micro Uzi, was launched in 2010 by Israel Weapon Industries Ltd. (I.W.I.), formerly the magen ("small arms") division of Israel Military Industries. The Uzi Pro is a blowback-operated, select-fire, closed-bolt submachine gun with a large lower portion, comprising grip and handguard, entirely made of polymer to reduce weight; the <b>grip</b> <b>section</b> was redesigned to allow two-handed operation and facilitate control in full-automatic fire with such a small-sized firearm. The Uzi Pro features three Picatinny rails, two {{at the sides of}} the barrel and one on the top for optics, the cocking handle having been moved on the left side. The new weapon weighs 2.32 kg and has a length of 529 mm with an extended stock, and 30 cm while collapsed. It has been purchased by the IDF in limited numbers for evaluation and it is yet to be decided whether or not to order additional units for all of its special forces.|$|E
50|$|The Trouble Zob Stick {{construction}} uses a pole that {{is covered}} with typical partially nailed-in rattle-capable beer bottle caps. A circular solid wooden ring, edged with bottle caps, is added {{near the top of}} the pole, with a hand <b>grip</b> <b>section</b> beneath. All the wooden parts are brightly painted. At the bottom a boot, supported by an internal wooden block, is added, with a metal spring attached to the sole. The spring serves no musical purpose but has comedy potential. Halfway up the pole is a sleeved-on metal tube for greater volume and a crisper percussive sound. The Zob Stick is rhythmically bounced on the floor and the metal sleeve hit with a wooden stick. The stick itself, (usually an adapted hockey stick because of its durability,) is serrated to achieve a scraping sound effect when necessary. Although the resultant construction is heavy, requiring strength for continual use, this weight gives it a volume and 'clout' that the traditional monkey stick might not match, especially in a live and loud band situation.|$|E
5000|$|In classic {{cross-country}} skiing the skis remain parallel, as the skier strides straight ahead. The undersides of the skis have a <b>grip</b> <b>section</b> {{in the middle}} treated with a special ski wax that provides friction when the foot is still, yet glides when the foot is in motion, {{while the rest of}} the ski bottom has a glide wax.

Both poles may be used simultaneously ("double-poling") or with alternating foot and arm extended (as with running or walking) with the pole pushing on the side opposite of the extended, sliding ski. In classic skiing the alternating technique is used for the [...] "diagonal stride"—the predominant classic sub-technique. In diagonal-stride legs move like in ordinary walking, but with longer and more powerful steps. Diagonal is useful on level ground and on gentle uphill slopes.

50|$|In 1953 {{a project}} for the {{engineering}} company and bolt manufacturer GKN took the North Bar Tool Company in a new product direction. GKN had designed a bolt called 'Prolong' that had a splined section above the nut. By <b>gripping</b> the splined <b>section</b> of the bolt and counter rotating the nut, the fastener could be tightened {{without the need for}} any external reaction device. In a further development, a shear groove was placed below the spline, so designed that the bolt would fail at the groove when the pre-determined torque had been achieved. This bolting method was known as 'Torshear'. GKN required an air driven tool capable of high torque output to sell with their 'Prolong' bolts. Probably Britain's best known gearbox designer of the time was Dr. Henry Edward Merritt and so Dr. Merritt was contracted to design a suitable range of air driven gearboxes for the Torshear application.|$|R
5000|$|In a Simpson gearset, {{common to}} many automatics, this {{happens on the}} 1-2 shift, and reverses on the 2-1 downshift. The 2-3 shift is done by {{engaging}} a single clutch, and nothing is released. Some newer electronically controlled transmissions make [...] "clutch to clutch" [...] shifts, without any sprags. This {{can also be used}} exclusively in first gear (transmission shift lever in D, but auto valve body or management selecting 1st) on some autos. That way it will automatically provide forward drive, but will not provide any engine braking. This is done not so much to avoid engine braking per se, but rather to allow a low throttle opening 2-1 downshift as a car decelerates, to avoid a loud (and potentially abrupt) and unnerving jolt {{as a result of the}} downshift. On transmissions so equipped, manual selection of 1st gear typically engages an additional band that <b>grips</b> the same <b>section</b> as the one way clutch would engage, and thus allows for engine braking.|$|R
