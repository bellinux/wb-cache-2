On 28 December, Isabella Macdonald died, leaving John A. Macdonald a widower with a seven-year-old son. Hugh John Macdonald would be principally raised by his paternal aunt and her husband.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, the {{construction}} of war cemeteries, graves and their associated memorials were typically placed {{under the control of}} a central state authority. The Imperial War Graves Commission (IWGC) took on this role <b>for</b> <b>Britain</b> and her empire. The Commissione nazionale per la onoranze ai caduti di guerra in Italy coordinated the military repatriation of bodies and {{the construction}} of cemeteries. The German war graves commission, the Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgräberfürsorge (VDK), was established in 1919, and took strict control over the creation and style of German war cemeteries. The American Battle Monuments Commission oversaw US military graves in a similar fashion.|$|E

5|$|The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact governed Soviet-German {{relations}} until June 1941 when Hitler, having occupied France and neutralised Britain, turned {{east and}} attacked the Soviet Union. Molotov {{was responsible for}} telling the Soviet people of the attack, when he instead of Stalin announced the war. His speech, broadcast by radio on 22 June, characterised the Soviet Union in a role similar to that articulated <b>for</b> <b>Britain</b> by Winston Churchill in his early wartime speeches. The State Defence Committee was established soon after Molotov's speech; Stalin was elected chairman and Molotov was elected deputy chairman.|$|E
5|$|The {{victories}} of 10 and 29 August {{allowed the}} allies the space {{they needed to}} withdraw. Following the August offensive minor patrol activity continued throughout September to provide a screen whilst forward positions were evacuated and stores either removed or destroyed.

When Charles's illegitimate son Monmouth assembled an invasion force at Amsterdam, and sailed <b>for</b> <b>Britain,</b> William informed James of Monmouth's departure, and ordered English regiments in the Low Countries to return to Britain.

The American ships drilled with their British counterparts from December 1917 to February 1918.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Harding took office, there were calls from foreign governments for {{reduction}} of the massive war debt owed to the United States, and the German government sought to reduce the reparations that it was required to pay. The U.S. refused to consider any multilateral settlement. Harding sought passage of a plan proposed by Mellon to give the administration broad authority to reduce war debts in negotiation, but Congress, in 1922, passed a more restrictive bill. Hughes negotiated an agreement <b>for</b> <b>Britain</b> to pay off its war debt over 62 years at low interest, effectively reducing {{the present value of}} the obligations. This agreement, approved by Congress in 1923, set a pattern for negotiations with other nations. Talks with Germany on reduction of reparations payments would result in the Dawes Plan of 1924.|$|E
