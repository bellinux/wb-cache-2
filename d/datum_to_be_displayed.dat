50|$|References {{serve as}} a level of indirection: A pointer's value determines which memory address (that <b>is,</b> which <b>datum)</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used in a calculation. Because indirection is a {{fundamental}} aspect of algorithms, pointers are often expressed as a fundamental data type in programming languages; in statically (or strongly) typed programming languages, the type of a pointer determines the type of the <b>datum</b> <b>to</b> which the pointer points.|$|R

A rod or staff is held vertical on that point and the instrument is used manually or automatically to read the rod scale. This gives {{the height of the}} instrument above the starting (backsight) point and allows the height of the instrument (H.I.) above the <b>datum</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> computed.|$|R

50|$|ETRS89 is the EU-recommended {{frame of}} {{reference}} for geodata for Europe. It is the only geodetic <b>datum</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used for mapping and surveying purposes in Europe.It plays the same role for Europe as NAD-83 for North America. (NAD-83 is a datum in which the North American Plate {{as a whole is}} static, and which is used for mapping and surveying in the US, Canada, and Mexico.) ETRS89 and NAD-83 are based on the GRS80 ellipsoid. WGS84 originally used the GRS80 reference ellipsoid, but has undergone some minor refinements in later editions since its initial publication.|$|R

Typically, inputs of a circuit module will indicate their readiness to receive, {{which will be}} [...] "acknowledged" [...] by the connected output by sending data (encoded {{in such a way}} that the receiver can detect the validity directly), and once that data has been safely received, the receiver will explicitly acknowledge it, allowing the sender to remove the data, thus completing the handshake, and allowing another <b>datum</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> transmitted.|$|R

There are also grid-based transformations that directly transform from one (datum, map projection) pair <b>to</b> another (<b>datum,</b> map projection) pair.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} problem of {{presenting}} anomalies in a multidimensional data set. In such a data set, some dimensions may be merely descriptive, while others represent measures and attribute values used {{to determine whether the}} data is anomalous. A data cube of the descriptive dimensions is used as a data structure to partition the data set into subgroups at each node, or context. It is shown that it is possible for a <b>datum</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> anomalous in more than one context. Previous work has dealt with this problem by embedding exception indicators in the data cube. Since the data cube is potentially large and anomalies are rare, searching for anomalies is inconvenient. Instead, it <b>is</b> proposed <b>to</b> construct a report for each anomaly that shows its status in each possible context. This results in a direct presentation of anomalous data...|$|R

40|$|The pH value <b>is</b> a {{fundamental}} <b>datum</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> monitored during marination. A method is proposed for calculating {{the evolution of}} pH of turkey meat cubes during marination in an acetic acid solution. It is based on measurement of the buffering capacity by acidification using a strong acid. A calculation based on the dissociation equilibrium of acetic acid <b>is</b> used <b>to</b> estimate the mean pH reached, factoring in the acid content of the meat. For long marination times, the calculated pH is over-evaluated {{in relation to the}} experimental value. This {{can be explained by the}} significant loss of buffering substances during immersion. After 6 h of immersion, the matrix's proton binding capacity may <b>be</b> reduced <b>to</b> just 20 % of the initial value. Hence to improve the prediction of meat cut pH during marination, it <b>is</b> necessary <b>to</b> factor in the outgoing flow of buffering substances. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
