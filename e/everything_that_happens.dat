25|$|Modern Kabbalah {{developed}} by Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag, {{in his writings}} about the future generation, focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework. Ashlag proposed that such a framework {{is the purpose of}} creation, and <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>happens</b> is to raise humanity to the level of altruism, love for one another. Ashlag focused on society and its relation to divinity.|$|E
25|$|According to Kant, {{we think}} of {{ourselves}} as having free will. This lets us make judgments such as “you ought to have done that thing that you did not do.” Kant argues that this notion of freedom cannot be derived from our experience. We can be sure that this concept of freedom doesn't come from experience because experience itself contradicts it. Our experience is of everything in the sensible world and in the sensible world, <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>happens</b> does so in accord with the laws of nature and {{there is no room for}} a free will to influence events.|$|E

25|$|Popular Islam {{is based}} mostly on oral tradition. Imams with {{virtually}} no formal education commonly memorize the entire Qur'an and recite appropriate verses on religious occasions. They also tell religious stories at village festivals and commemorations marking an individual's rites of passage. Predestination {{plays an important role}} in popular Islam. This concept includes the belief that <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>happens</b> in life is the will of God and the belief that trying to avoid misfortune is useless and invites worse affliction. Revelations from God in the Qur'an form the basis of Monotheism merged with a belief in angels, and jinns (spirits).|$|E
25|$|The way Kant {{suggests}} that we should deal with this dialectic is through {{an appeal to the}} two perspectives we can take on ourselves. This is the same sort of move he made earlier in this section. On one perspective, the perspective of the world of understanding, we are free, whereas from the other, the perspective of the world of the senses or appearances, natural laws determine <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>happens.</b> There is no contradiction because the claim to freedom applies to one world, and the claim of the laws of nature determining everything applies to the other. The claims do not conflict because they have different targets.|$|E
25|$|Over the centuries, many Christian {{scholars}} {{wrestled with}} {{the conflict between the}} belief in free will and its implied randomness, and the idea that God knows <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>happens.</b> Saints Augustine and Aquinas tried to reach an accommodation between foreknowledge and free will, but Martin Luther argued against randomness and took the position that God's omniscience renders human actions unavoidable and determined. In the 13th century, Thomas Aquinas viewed randomness not {{as the result of a}} single cause, but of several causes coming together by chance. While he believed in the existence of randomness, he rejected it as an explanation of the end-directedness of nature, for he saw too many patterns in nature to have been obtained by chance.|$|E

25|$|In the {{previous}} Oz book, The Emerald City of Oz, magic {{was used to}} isolate Oz from all outside worlds. Baum did this to end the Oz series, but was forced to restart the series with this book due to financial hardships. In the prologue, he explains how {{he managed to get}} another story about Oz, even though it is isolated from all other worlds. He explains that a child suggested he make contact with Oz with wireless telegraphy. Glinda, using her book that records <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>happens,</b> is able to know that someone is using a telegraph to contact Oz, so she erects a telegraph tower and has the Shaggy Man, who knows how to make a telegraph reply, tell the story contained in this book to Baum.|$|E
25|$|The ordinary, familiar, {{everyday}} {{things and}} occurrences we have, constitute occasions {{for the experience}} of God. Such things as one's daily sustenance, the very day itself, are felt as manifestations of God's loving-kindness, calling for the Berakhot. Kedushah, holiness, which is nothing else than the imitation of God, is concerned with daily conduct, with being gracious and merciful, with keeping oneself from defilement by idolatry, adultery, and the shedding of blood. The Birkat Ha-Mitzwot evokes the consciousness of holiness at a rabbinic rite, but the objects employed {{in the majority of}} these rites are non-holy and of general character, while the several holy objects are non-theurgic. And not only do ordinary things and occurrences bring with them the experience of God. <b>Everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>happens</b> to a man evokes that experience, evil as well as good, for a Berakah is said also at evil tidings. Hence, although the experience of God is like none other, the occasions for experiencing Him, for having a consciousness of Him, are manifold, even if we consider only those that call for Berakot.|$|E
25|$|Nine years later, in 1832, Paris is in {{upheaval}} {{because of}} the impending death of General Lamarque, {{the only man in}} the government who shows mercy to the poor. Among those mingling in the streets are the student revolutionaries Marius Pontmercy and Enjolras, who contemplate the effect Lamarque's death will have on the poor and desperate in Paris; the Thénardiers, who have since lost their inn and now run a street gang; their daughter Éponine, who is now grown and has fallen in love with Marius (who is oblivious to her affections); and the streetwise young urchin Gavroche, who knows <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>happens</b> in the slums ("Look Down"). The Thénardiers prepare to con some charitable visitors, who turn out to be Valjean and Cosette, who has grown into a beautiful young woman. While the gang bamboozles her father, Cosette runs into Marius, and the pair fall in love at first sight. Thénardier suddenly recognizes Valjean, but before they can finish the robbery, Javert, now an inspector stationed here in Paris, comes to the rescue ("The Robbery"). Valjean and Cosette escape, and only later (when Thénardier tips him off) does Javert suspect who they were. Javert makes a vow to the stars (which represent his belief in a just and ordered universe where suffering is a punishment for sin) that he will find Valjean and recapture him ("Stars"). Meanwhile, Marius persuades Éponine to help him find Cosette ("Éponine's Errand").|$|E
