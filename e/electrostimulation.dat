25|$|High-end, {{chrome plated}} steel dildos {{are also popular}} in the BDSM scene.

Because they are heavy, they can be used to exercise vaginal PC muscles.|$|E
25|$|Vogt-Mugnier and her husband's main {{interest}} was {{the identification and}} characterization of distinct regions in the neocortex by both functional and structural criteria. The Vogts were attempting to precisely locate the regions in the cerebral cortex that correlate with specific brain functions. This also motivated their experimental work on <b>electrostimulation</b> of the cortices in 150 monkeys. In this endeavor, they collaborated with Korbinian Brodmann to map areas of the cortex and the thalamus.|$|E
30|$|We {{develop a}} sixth finger device system as an {{extension}} of the human body, a thumb motion capture device to control movements of the device, and a electrical stimulation device to convey contact information. We then perform experiments using the sixth finger device with somatosensory feedback during 1  month with varying rest time between sessions, with and without visual feedback. In addition, the sixth finger device is controlled by mirroring the movement of the thumb from the opposite hand, while giving somatosensory feedback from contact information via <b>electrostimulations.</b> From the experimental results, the performance on a reaching task and the modification of self-perception of the controlling finger after each session are evaluated. Finally, we discuss about ability of the brain to adapt to different scenarios and geometries of the body though the evaluations.|$|R
40|$|International audienceNeurophysiological and neuroimaging studies {{including}} both patients with disorders of consciousness and healthy subjects with modified {{states of consciousness}} suggest a crucial role of the medial posteroparietal cortex in conscious information processing. However no direct neuropsychological evidence supports this hypothesis and studies including patients with restricted lesions of this brain region are almost nonexistent. Using direct intraoperative <b>electrostimulations,</b> we showed in a rare patient that disrupting the subcortical connectivity of the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) reliably induced a breakdown in conscious experience. This acute phenomenon was mainly characterized by a transient behavioral unresponsiveness with loss of external connectedness. In all cases, when he regained consciousness, the patient described himself as in dream, outside the operating room. This finding suggests that functional integrity of the PPC connectivity is necessary for maintaining consciousness of external environment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Different animal {{models are}} used to {{evaluate}} the process of epileptogenesis. In this investigation the kindling model of epilepsy was used. The epileptic focus was induced in Chinchilla rabbits by stimulation of the hippocampus with electric stimuli. We presumed that the extracts of Ginkgo biloba affect the formation of kindling epilepsy. Bioelectric activity of the brain was registered throughout the development of kindling with and without standardized extracts from dried ginkgo leaves (EGb 761). For each animal the following has been determined: the values of the minimum current strength necessary for the origination of threshold after-discharge (AD) Ã¢Â€Â“ discharges appearing after the cessation of stimulation; duration of the threshold AD; number of stimulations necessary for the origination of full kindling; time latency for the development of full kindling; number of spontaneous epileptogenic discharges manifested in EEG two days following the formation of full kindling during 60 -minute registration. The results show that the process of epileptogenesis was influenced by EGb 761. It has been established that if the animals received EGb 761, significantly weaker minimum current strength was necessary {{for the development of the}} epileptogenic focus and the AD were longer, while the number of necessary <b>electrostimulations</b> for the appearance of full kindling was less and the latency was shorter...|$|R
25|$|While {{acupuncture}} {{leads to}} improvements in pain relief, this improvement {{is small and}} may be of questionable importance. Waiting list-controlled trials for peripheral joint osteoarthritis do show clinically relevant benefits, but these {{may be due to}} placebo effects. Acupuncture does not seem to produce long-term benefits. While <b>electrostimulation</b> techniques such as TENS have been used for twenty years to treat osteoarthritis in the knee, there is no conclusive evidence to show that it reduces pain or disability.|$|E
25|$|Orgasms can be {{achieved}} by a variety of activities, including vaginal, anal or oral sex, non-penetrative sex or masturbation. Orgasm may also {{be achieved}} by the use of a sex toy, such as a sensual vibrator or an erotic <b>electrostimulation.</b> It can additionally be achieved by stimulation of the nipples or other erogenous zones, though this is rarer. In addition to physical stimulation, orgasm {{can be achieved}} from psychological arousal alone, such as during dreaming (nocturnal emission for males or females) or by orgasm control. Orgasm by psychological stimulation alone was first reported among people who had spinal cord injury. Although sexual function and sexuality after spinal cord injury is very often impacted, this injury does not deprive one of sexual feelings such as sexual arousal and erotic desires.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVEdLong-term {{diabetes}} {{leads to}} severe peripheral, autonomous, and central neu-ropathy {{in combination with}} clinical gastrointestinal symptoms. The brain-gut axis thus expresses a neurophysiological profile, and heart rate variability (HRV) can be correlated with clinical gastrointestinal symptoms. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSdFifteen healthy volunteers and 15 diabetic patients (12 with type 1 diabetes) with severe gastrointestinal symptoms and clinical suspicion of autonomic neuropathy were included. Psychophysics and evoked brain potentials were assessed after painful rectosigmoid <b>electrostimulations,</b> and brain activity was modeled by brain electrical source analysis. Self-reported gastrointestinal symptoms (per the Patient Assessment of Upper Gastrointestinal Disorder Severity Symptom Index) {{and quality of life}} (SF- 36 Short Form Survey) were collected. RESULTSdDiabetic patients had autonomous neuropathy, evidenced by decreased electro-cardiographic R-R interval (P = 0. 03) and lower HRV (P = 0. 008). Patients were less sensitive to painful stimulation (P = 0. 007), had prolonged latencies of evoked potentials (P # 0. 001), and showed diminished amplitude of the N 2 –P 2 component in evoked potentials (P = 0. 01). There was a caudoanterior shift of the insular brain source (P = 0. 01) and an anterior shift of the cingulate generator (P = 0. 01). Insular source location was associated with HRV assessments (all P, 0. 02), and the shift (expressed in mm) correlated negatively with physical health (P, 0. 001) and positively with nausea (P = 0. 03) and postprandial fullness (P = 0. 03). Cingulate source shift was correlated negatively with physical health (P = 0. 005) and positively with post-prandial fullness (P # 0. 001). CONCLUSIONSdThis study provides evidence for interaction between autonomic neurop-athy and peripheral nervous degeneration, as well as changes in dipole sources in diabetic patients with gastrointestinal symptoms. The findings may lead to improved treatment modal-ities targeting pharmacological neuroprotection or neuromodulation...|$|R
2500|$|In some BDSM sessions, the top {{exposes the}} bottom {{to a wide range}} of sensual experiences, for example: pinching, biting, {{scratching}} with fingernails, erotic spanking or the use of objects such as crops, whips, liquid wax, ice cubes, Wartenberg wheels, and erotic <b>electrostimulation</b> devices. Fixation by handcuffs, ropes or chains may be used as well. The repertoire of possible [...] "toys" [...] is limited only by the imagination of both partners. To some extent, everyday items like clothes-pins, wooden spoons or plastic wrap are used as pervertables. It is commonly considered that a pleasurable BDSM experience during a session is very strongly dependent upon the top's competence and experience and the bottom's physical and mental state at the time of the session. Trust and sexual arousal help the partners enter a shared mindset.|$|E

50|$|Erotic <b>electrostimulation</b> (abbreviated e-stim {{and also}} known as electrosex) is a sexual {{practice}} involving the application of electrical stimulation to the nerves of the body, with particular emphasis on the genitals, using a power source (such as a TENS, EMS, Violet wand, or made-for-play units) for purposes of sexual stimulation. <b>Electrostimulation</b> {{has been associated with}} BDSM activities, and erotic <b>electrostimulation</b> is an evolution of that practice.|$|E
50|$|Erotic <b>electrostimulation</b> {{refers to}} the act of using {{electricity}} for sexual stimulation. <b>Electrostimulation</b> dates back {{as early as the}} mid 1700s. By the mid 1970s, medical transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) machines were widely available. The machines work by stimulating nerve endings with electricity, sending signals of stimulation to the brain. <b>Electrostimulation</b> works off this same principle, when the brain received a signal of stimulation from the genitals, pleasure hormones are released.|$|E
50|$|Passive exercising {{by direct}} {{skeletal}} muscle <b>electrostimulation.</b> In this, flat metal electrodes smeared with a conductive gel are affixed to certain {{points in the}} face and an <b>electrostimulation</b> divide is used to generate waveforms which promote facial muscle contractions.|$|E
50|$|The {{image of}} the woman {{receiving}} <b>electrostimulation</b> to the right shows a deprecated practice.

50|$|<b>Electrostimulation,</b> in general, {{can cause}} tissue damage or even death if misused. The most common {{problems}} arising from <b>electrostimulation</b> {{tend to be}} burns from lack of sufficiently wide surface contact, i.e. bad contact, between the electrode and the skin's surface. Even at relatively low current and voltage, there is also risk of interference with normal heart function (potentially including cardiac arrest), and this risk is higher for those who use an artificial pacemaker or similar device or who have heart conditions. Because of this, it is not advisable to place the electrical contacts {{in such a way}} that current passes through the chest cavity. Newcomers are encouraged to research the hazards, limitations, and techniques of <b>electrostimulation</b> and the devices used.|$|E
50|$|Erotic <b>electrostimulation</b> of {{the breasts}} is also practiced {{although}} such activity around the chest area may carry risks of electrocution.|$|E

50|$|Electroconductive gels play an {{important}} role in the success of erotic <b>electrostimulation</b> since without it, there is a greater risk of high-current skin burning. Water-based lubricants are generally recommended. Typically it is recommended to avoid any lubricant that contains silicone since it is an insulator and hence reduces conductivity. Practitioners of <b>electrostimulation</b> select lubricants for compatibility with the material of the electrodes, as well as for desirable conductive properties, which can maximize the strength and quality of the signal.|$|E

5000|$|Some people craft [...] "homemade" [...] <b>electrostimulation</b> power sources, or adapt {{or modify}} {{commercial}} products (such as a Hifi or DVD system) {{that were never}} intended for <b>electrostimulation</b> of the human body.
