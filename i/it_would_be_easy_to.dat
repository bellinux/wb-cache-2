5|$|Schlesselman and Cowart chatted on the Internet {{about how}} {{to carry out the}} operation. Schlesselman {{suggested}} using a sawed-off shotgun because <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> maneuver; he also said he planned to steal a gun from his father. Prior to their arrest, the men decorated their car with a Swastika and drew the numbers 88 and 14 on their hood using window chalk. Authorities believe the men may have planned to move from state to state to choose their victims. They also planned to wear white tuxedos and top hats during the assassination attempt.|$|E
5|$|By this time, Wang's {{only hope}} for rescue was an {{intervention}} by Dou Jiande, to whom he had sent envoys already in late 620. For Dou, the situation, as presented by his councillor Liu Bin, offered both danger and opportunity: if Luoyang fell, the Tang would next turn against Dou, but if Dou intervened and saved Luoyang, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> oust the weakened Wang and annex Henan to his own Xia state. It was therefore probably by design that Dou waited until April, when Wang's situation was critical, before he began marching west to relieve the siege of Luoyang. Dou's army was a huge force, reportedly over 100,000 strong, and the two earliest sources report 120,000 men. Although possibly exaggerated, an army of this size was well within {{the capabilities of the}} time. The Xia army was accompanied by a similarly large supply train, comprising both carts and boats.|$|E

25|$|Within {{two months}} of their introduction, sales at New Zealand {{restaurants}} increase by approximately 10%, and drew the attention of Burger King Holdings. BKH observed the sales trends and market acceptance of the products for several months after the introduction for the possible purpose of extending the concept in other markets. While the concept was tailored for the New Zealand market, TPF executives stated that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> adapt the concept to other regions. Some restaurant industry observers agreed with the TPF assessment of the products and separately stated other sauces and ingredients {{could be used to}} crate variations in the US and other markets.

25|$|German forces {{crossed the}} Seine on 9 June, {{cutting off the}} 51st (Highland) Division north of the river, two days after 52nd (Lowland) Division had begun to land and the {{assembly}} of the division was changed to Rennes in Brittany; the 157th (Highland Light Infantry) Brigade which arrived first, was directed to Beaumont near Le Mans, {{the rest of the}} division to follow on. The 1st Canadian Infantry Brigade of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division began its arrival at Brest on 11 June and was sent to Sablé-sur-Sarthe, on the assumption that two fresh divisions would be enough to allow the Tenth Army and attached British troops to retreat through them and take up positions prepared around the Brest peninsula. That day, the Anglo-French Supreme War Council met at Briare and General Charles de Gaulle (Minister of War) was sent to Rennes to survey progress on the redoubt; on 12 June, De Gaulle reported that Quimper would be a favourable place for the government to retreat to, since <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> take ship to England or Africa, since the prospect of maintaining a redoubt in Brittany was non-existent.|$|E

500|$|With the American Revolutionary War beginning, {{many thought}} <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> spread the {{rebellion}} to the Province of Quebec, which {{had only been}} conquered by the British in 1759, and whose population was seen as resentful of British rule.

[...] Schuyler, who was ill at the time, eventually turned command of the army over the General Richard Montgomery, who ordered the army to besiege Fort Saint-Jean, which they did on September 18. At this fort, south of Montreal on the Richelieu River, General Guy Carleton had concentrated the few British regulars at his disposal following the capture of Fort Ticonderoga in May.|$|E
500|$|... 2010: On February 7, Favre {{appeared}} in a second quarter Super Bowl XLIV ad for Hyundai parodying his retirement indecisiveness.

In April, Favre indicated that {{if it were not for}} his Vikings teammates and fans, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> retire. In early August, Favre's ankle (which was injured during the 2009 playoffs) had not responded after surgery and rehabilitation.

500|$|Montagu and Cholmondeley {{began to}} create a [...] "legend" [...] – a fictitious {{background}} and character – for the body. The name and rank chosen was Captain (Acting Major) William Martin, of the Royal Marines assigned to Combined Operations Headquarters. The name [...] "Martin" [...] was selected because there were several men with that name of about that rank in the Royal Marines. As a Royal Marine, Major Martin came under Admiralty authority, and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> ensure that all official inquiries and messages about his death would be routed to the Naval Intelligence Division. Additionally, Royal Marines would wear battledress, which was easily obtainable and came in standard sizes.

This led to instilling a [...] "sense of progress" [...] and growth of the character in all aspects of the game including the story, the progression of the player's powers, and the variation and difficulty in the enemies that the player faced. The team initially brainstormed on what powers that the lead character had, but selected electricity-based powers for two primary reasons. First, the power translated well to a video game context, as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> conceptualize the aspects of electrical-based powers in terms of video game concepts such as ranged combat. Secondly, electrical-based powers could then be tied to the city that the player would explore, requiring the player to use the city's electricity as fuel, and thus developing a [...] "real relationship with the city".|$|E

500|$|For So Beautiful or So What, Simon {{reunited with}} record {{producer}} and former collaborator Phil Ramone, who previously {{worked with him}} on Simon & Garfunkel's 1982 live album The Concert in Central Park. According to Simon, the reunion came casually; he told Ramone when they met each other that {{he was beginning to}} work on a new album and, as Ramone lived in the next town, they decided <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> work together again. Simon recorded the album at his small cottage in New Canaan, Connecticut. The recording sessions often consisted solely of Simon, Ramone, and engineer Andy Smith. Throughout the production of the record, the album’s engineers would gradually make upgrades to the space during months off. As it was not acoustically designed or soundproofed, Smith often employed iZotope RX software to rid the recordings of extra noise, such as an oak tree above the home from which acorns fell, interrupting recordings. Keeping in line with his experimental attitude, Simon decided to record the acorns, remarking, [...] "All sounds are musical once you start to listen." [...] Occasionally, Simon would record in the control room instead. Like all of Simon’s output from his 1997 effort Songs from The Capeman onward, the album was recorded digitally using Pro Tools.|$|E
500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{felt that}} [...] "Grilled Cheesus" [...] was too varied tonally, failing to {{effectively}} {{bring together the}} [...] "true anguish" [...] of Kurt's storyline and [...] "lunacy" [...] of Finn's. He rated it 7.5/10, signifying a good episode, though his overall opinion was mixed. Canning commented that the Hummels' relationship is [...] "the most affecting" [...] of the show, and praised O'Malley's [...] "outstandingly nuanced" [...] performance as Burt, yet felt that the religious element gave the episode an after school special vibe and almost became [...] "over-the-top preachy and self-important". VanDerWerff graded the episode [...] "B-", commenting that he was uncertain whether he genuinely loved it, or was overlooking flaws because it handled the religious element acceptably. VanDerWerff stated that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> criticize Glee, but while television as a whole does not do earnestness well, Glee at its best, as in [...] "Grilled Cheesus", [...] "revels in just how damn earnest it can be". James Poniewozik of Time wrote that the episode's premise was [...] "absurdly ambitious", yet felt it was largely successful in being respectful to both atheism and religion. He criticized the musical numbers for detracting from the plot, but appreciated the focus on Kurt and Burt, also naming theirs one of Glee [...] "strongest and most nuanced relationships".|$|E

500|$|Reasons {{cited for}} the failure of the Dreamcast include hype for the PS2; a lack of support from EA and Squaresoft, {{considered}} the most popular third-parties in the U.S. and Japan respectively; disagreement among Sega executives over the company's future, and Okawa's lack of commitment to the product; Sega's lack of advertising money, with Bellfield doubting that Sega spent even [...] "half" [...] the $100 million it had pledged to promote the Dreamcast in the U.S.; that the market was not yet ready for online gaming; Sega's focus on [...] "hardcore" [...] gamers over the mainstream consumer; and poor timing. Perhaps the most frequently cited reason is the damage to Sega's reputation caused by several previous poorly supported Sega platforms. Writing for GamePro, Blake Snow stated that [...] "The much beloved console launched years ahead of the competition but ultimately struggled to shed the negative reputation [...] had gained during the Saturn, Sega 32X, and Sega CD days. As a result, casual gamers and jaded third-party developers doubted Sega's ability to deliver." [...] Eurogamer's Dan Whitehead noted that the [...] "wait and see" [...] approach of consumers and the lack of support from EA were symptoms rather the cause of Sega's decline, concluding [...] "Sega's misadventures during the 1990s had left both gamers and publishers wary of any new platform bearing its name." [...] According to 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish, [...] "While <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> point an accusatory finger at Sony and blame them for killing the Dreamcast by overselling the PS2... there's a certain level of intellectual dishonesty in such a stance... 's poor U.S. support for hardware like the Sega CD, the 32X, and the Saturn made gamers gun shy. Many consumers felt burned after investing in expensive Sega machines and finding the resulting libraries comparatively lacking".|$|E
