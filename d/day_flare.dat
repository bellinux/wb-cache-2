40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the effects of}} {{absorption}} and Faraday rotation on measurements of polar mesosphere summer echoes (PMSE). We found that such effects can produce significant reduction of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when the D region electron densities (Ne) are enhanced, and VHF radar systems with linearly polarized antennas are used. In particular we study the expected effects during the strong solar proton event (SPE) of July 2000, also known as the Bastille <b>day</b> <b>flare</b> event. During this event, a strong anti-correlation between the PMSE SNR and the D-region Ne was found over three VHF radar sites at high latitudes: Andøya, Kiruna, and Svalbard. This anti-correlation has been explained (a) in terms of transport effects due to strong electric fields associated to the SPE and (b) due to a limited amount of aerosol particles as compared to the amount of D-region electrons. Our calculations using the Ne profiles used by previous researchers explain most, if not all, of the observed SNR reduction in both time (around the SPE peak) and altitude. This systematic effect, particularly the Faraday rotation, should be recognized and tested, and possibly avoided (e. g., using circular polarization), in future observations during the incoming solar maximum period, to contribute to the understanding of PMSE during enhanced D region Ne...|$|E
40|$|We {{model in}} detail a flare {{observed}} on Proxima Centauri with the EPIC-PN on board XMM-Newton at high statistics and high time resolution and coverage. Time-dependent hydrodynamic loop modeling {{is used to}} describe the rise and peak of the light curve, and a large fraction of the decay, including its change of slope and a secondary maximum, over a duration of more than 2 hours. The light curve, the emission measure and the temperature derived from the data allow us to constrain the loop morphology and the heating function and to show that this flare can be described with two components: a major one triggered by an intense heat pulse injected in a single flaring loop with half-length ~ 1. 0 10 ^{ 10 } cm, the other one by less intense heat pulses released after about 1 / 2 hour since the first one in related loop systems, probably arcades, with the same half-length. The heat functions of the two loop systems appear be very similar: an intense pulse located at the loop footpoints followed by a low gradual decay distributed in corona. The latter result and the similarity to at least one solar event (the Bastille <b>Day</b> <b>flare</b> in 2000) indicate that this pattern may be common to solar and stellar flares, in wide generality.

40|$|Models of Blazars {{based on}} the {{propagation}} of finite discontinuities or fronts in the Poynting flux jet from the innermost regions of an accretion disk around a black hole are discussed. Such fronts {{may be responsible for}} short time-scale (from less than hours to <b>days)</b> <b>flares</b> in different wavebands from high frequency radioband to TeV, with delay in low radio frequencies as a result of synchrotron self-absorption. The cases of magnetic fields of one and opposite polarities across the front are investigated. We find that annihilation of magnetic field in the front leads to higher energy spectrum of leptons and possibility of strong TeV flares. Electron-positron pairs form in most cases as a result of interaction between numerous synchrotron photons and SSC photons, and constitute the majority species, compared with the ions at subparsec scales. Frequent weak outbursts may be responsible for flickering core radiation in all wavebands, while the stronger outbursts may be observed as short time-scale flares.

40|$|Most studies {{dealing with}} solar flare {{effects in the}} upper ionosphere, where {{ionization}} is caused by EUV photons, have been based upon X-ray fluxes measured by the SOLRAD and GOES series of satellites. To check the validity of such studies, we compare simultaneous observations of GOES X-ray fluxes and SOHO EUV fluxes for 10 X-class solar flares which occurred during the maximum phase of sunspot cycle 23. These include the greatest flare of 4 November 2003, the fourth greatest flare of 28 October 2003 and the 14 July 2000 Bastille <b>Day</b> <b>flare.</b> We find that the peak intensities of the X-ray and EUV fluxes for these flares are poorly correlated, and this poor correlation is again seen when larger data containing 70 X-class flares, which occurred during the period January 1996 to December 2006, are examined. However, this correlation improves vastly when the central meridian distance (CMD) of the flare location is taken into account. We also study {{the response of the}} upper ionosphere to these fluxes by using the midday total electron content (TEC), observed for these flares by Liu et al. (2006).

The X-ray evolution is compared to the evolution in optical and radio. We fit the X- ray spectra with phenomenological and Comptonization models. We discuss possible scenarios for the physical origin of a ~ 50 <b>day</b> <b>flare</b> observed both in optical and X- rays ~ 170 days after {{the peak of the}} outburst. We conclude that it is a result of enhanced mass accretion in response to an earlier heating event. We {{characterized the}} evolution in the hard X-ray band and showed that for the joint ISGRI-XRT fits, the e-folding energy decreased from 350 keV to 130 keV, while the energy where the exponential cut-off starts increased from 75 keV to 112 keV as the decay progressed. We investigated the claim that high energy cut-offs disappear with the compact jet turning on during outburst decays, and showed that spectra taken with HEXTE on RXTE provide insufficient quality to characterize cut-offs during the decay for typical hard X-ray fluxes. Long INTEGRAL monitoring observations are required to understand the relation between the compact jet formation and hard X-ray behavior. We found that for the entire decay (including the flare), the X-ray spectra are consistent with thermal Comptonization, but a jet synchrotron origin cannot be ruled out.

In this paper we {{examine the effect of}} gamma-ray absorption by the extragalactic infrared radiation on intrinsic spectra for this blazar and compare our results with the observational data on 3 C 279. We find agreement with our previous results, contrary to the recent assertion of the MAGIC group that the Universe is more transparent to gamma-rays than our calculations indicate. Our analysis indicates that in the energy range between approx. 80 and approx. 500 GeV, 3 C 279 has a best-fit intrinsic spectrum with a spectral index approx. 1. 78 using our fast evolution model and approx. 2. 19 using our baseline model. However, we also find that spectral indices in the range of 1. 0 to 3. 0 are almost as equally acceptable as the best fit spectral indices. Assuming the same intrinsic spectral index for this flare as for the 1991 flare from 3 C 279 observed by EGRET, viz., 2. 02, which lies between our best fit indeces, we estimate that the MAGIC flare was approx. 3 times brighter than the EGRET flare observed 15 years earlier...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that photospheric flux {{emergence}} is an important process for stressing coronal fields and storing magnetic free energy, which may then be released during a flare. The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) captured the entire emergence of NOAA AR 11158. This region emerged as two distinct bipoles, possibly connected underneath the photosphere, yet characterized by different photospheric field evolutions and fluxes.

Combining this with observations of flare ribbons in the 1600 Å channel of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard SDO, we propose a minimization algorithm for estimating the amount of reconnected flux and resulting drop in magnetic free energy during a flare. For the M 6. 6, M 2. 2, and X 2. 2 flares, we find a flux exchange of 4. 2 × 10 ^ 20 Mx, 2. 0 × 10 ^ 20 Mx, and 21. 0 × 10 ^ 20 Mx, respectively, resulting in free energy drops of 3. 89 × 10 ^ 30 ergs, 2. 62 × 10 ^ 30 ergs, and 1. 68 × 10 ^ 32 ergs.

In this paper, we describe a detailed temporal and spectral analysis of the VERITAS VHE gamma-ray observations of M 87 in 2008 and 2009. In the 2008 observing season, VERITAS detected an excess with a statistical significance of 7. 2 standard deviations (sigma) from M 87 during a joint multi-wavelength monitoring campaign conducted by three major VHE experiments along with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. In 2008 February, VERITAS observed a VHE flare from M 87 occurring over a 4 day timespan. The peak nightly flux above 250 GeV was (1. 14 +/- 0. 26) x 10 (- 11) cm(- 2) s(- 1), which corresponded to 7. 7 % of the Crab Nebula flux. M 87 was marginally detected before this 4 <b>day</b> <b>flare</b> period, and was not detected afterward.

The wavelet analysis of VLF amplitude on control day reveals presence of WLS with periods 40 - 180 minutes during day/night and night/day transition times which are probably generated due to passage of dusk and dawn solar terminator. <b>Flare</b> <b>day</b> WLS are observed with period varying 90 - 200 minutes and are remarkably different in their period, occurrence duration/time and amplitude depending on the class and occurrence time of flare and are more prominent during morning and evening times when D-region is in developing stage. The WLS on <b>flare</b> <b>day</b> are probably generated by solar flare induced gravity waves which may cause periodic changes in temperature, electron density, and plasma conductivity in the ionosphere. The present observations seem to shed additional light on the current understanding of gravity wave induced D-region dynamics...|$|R
40|$|The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope {{provides}} unprecedented sensitivity for all-sky {{monitoring of}} gamma-ray activity from 20 MeV to > 300 GeV. The observatory scans the entire sky every {{three hours and}} allows a general search for flaring activity on daily timescales. This search is conducted automatically {{as part of the}} ground processing and allows a fast response to transient events, typically less than a <b>day.</b> Most <b>flares</b> are spatially associated with known blazars, but in several cases {{during the first year of}} observations, gamma-ray flares occurring near the Galactic plane did not reveal any initially compelling counterparts. This prompted follow-up observations in X-ray, optical, and radio to attempt to identify the origin of the emission and probe the possible existence of a class of transient gamma-ray sources in the Galaxy. We will report on the details of these LAT events and the results of the multi-wavelength counterpart searches...|$|R
40|$|Flares {{are a major}} {{explosive}} {{event in}} our solar system. They are often followed by coronal mass ejection that has a potential to trigger the geomagnetic storms. There are various studies aiming to predict when and where the flares are likely to occur. Most of these studies mainly discuss the photospheric and chromospheric activity before the flare onset. In this paper we study the coronal features before the famous large flare occurrence on December 13 th, 2006. Using the data from Hinode/EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS), X-Ray Telescope (XRT), and Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) /Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT), we discuss the coronal features in the large scale (~ a few 100 arcsec) before the flare onset. Our findings are as follows: 1) The upflows in and around active region start growing from ~ 10 to 30 km /s a <b>day</b> before the <b>flare.</b> 2) The expanding coronal loops are clearly observed {{a few hours before}} the flare. 3) Soft X-ray and EUV intensity are gradually reduced. 4) The upflows are further enhanced after the flare. From these observed signatures, we conclude that the outer part of active region loops with low density were expanding a <b>day</b> before the <b>flare</b> onset, and the inner part with high density were expanding a few hours before the onset.
