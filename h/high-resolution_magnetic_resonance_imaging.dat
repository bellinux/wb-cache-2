40|$|Subcortical nuclei in the thalamus, which play an {{important}} role in many functions of the human brain, provide challenging targets for functional mapping with neuroimaging techniques because of their small sizes and deep locations. In this study, we explore the capability of <b>high-resolution</b> functional <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> at 4 Tesla for mapping the retinotopic organization in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Our results show that the hemifield visual stimulation only activates LGN in the contralateral hemisphere, and the lower-field and upper-field visual stimulations activate the superior and inferior portion of LGN, respectively. These results reveal a similar retinotopic organization between the human and nonhuman primate LGN and between LGN and the primary visual cortex.

40|$|We show here, using <b>high-resolution</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging,</b> that injured tissue {{provides}} a favourable milieu for the neovascularization {{and growth of}} C 6 glioma spheroids, implanted subcutaneously in nude mice. Moreover, the presence of micro-tumours in an injured tissue inhibited the healing process, leaving an open persistent wound. In correlation with the induced angiogenesis of implanted spheroids {{in the presence of}} proximal wounds, a shorter lag period was observed for initiation of tumour growth. This effect was restricted spatially and was observed only for wounds within 5 mm from the tumour. In such proximal wounds, angiogenesis was enhanced in the first days after injury, and vessel regression, which normally starts 4 days after injury, did not occur. Injury causing interference to tumour perfusion promoted tumour vascularization and growth even for more remote incisions, possibly by activating stress-induced angiogenesis. The kinetics of vascularization and growth of these wound-tumour systems sheds light on the clinical observations of increased probability of metastatic recurrence and stimulated regrowth of residual tumour in the site of surgical intervention. <b>High-resolution</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> could detect the aberrant angiogenic activity of these tumour-wound systems as early as 1 week after injury...|$|E
