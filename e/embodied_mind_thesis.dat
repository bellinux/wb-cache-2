These programs simulated intelligence using logic and high-level abstract symbols (an approach called Good old-fashioned AI). This [...] "disembodied" [...] approach ran into serious difficulties in the 1970s and 80s, as researchers discovered that abstract, disembodied reasoning was highly inefficient and could not achieve human-levels of competence on many simple tasks. Funding agencies (such as DARPA) withdrew funding because the field of AI had failed to achieve its stated objectives, leading to difficult period now known as the [...] "AI winter". Many AI researchers began to doubt that high level symbolic reasoning could ever perform well enough to solve simple problems.|$|E
5000|$|Phenomenology within {{psychology}} (Phenomenological Psychology) is {{the psychological}} study of subjective experience. It is {{an approach to}} psychological subject matter that {{has its roots in}} the philosophical work of Edmund Husserl. Early phenomenologists such as Husserl, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty conducted philosophical investigations of consciousness in the early 20th century. Their critiques of psychologism and positivism later influenced at least two main fields of contemporary psychology: the phenomenological psychological approach of the Duquesne School (The Descriptive Phenomenological Method in Psychology), including Amedeo Giorgi and Frederick Wertz; and the experimental approaches associated with Francisco Varela, Shaun Gallagher, Evan Thompson, and others (<b>embodied</b> <b>mind</b> <b>thesis).</b> Other names associated with the movement include Jonathan Smith (Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis), Steinar Kvale, and Wolfgang Köhler. But [...] "an even stronger influence on psychopathology came from Heidegger (1963), particularly through Kunz (1931), Blankenburg (1971), Tellenbach (1983), Binswanger (1994), and others." [...] Phenomenological psychologists have also figured prominently in the history of the humanistic psychology movement.|$|E

40|$|To {{subscribe}} to the <b>embodied</b> <b>mind</b> (or embodiment) framework is to reject the view that an individual's mind is realized by her brain alone. As Clark (2008 a) has argued, {{there are two ways}} to {{subscribe to}} embodiment: bodycentrism (BC) and the extended <b>mind</b> (EM) <b>thesis.</b> According to BC, an <b>embodied</b> <b>mind</b> is a two-place relation between an individual's brain and her non-neural bodily anatomy. According to EM, an <b>embodied</b> <b>mind</b> is a threeplace relation between an individual's brain, her non-neural body and her non-bodily environment. I argue that BC can be given a weak and a strong interpretation, according to whether it accepts a functionalist account of the contribution of the non-neural body to higher cognitive functions and a computational account of the contents of concepts and the nature of conceptual processing. Thus, weak BC amounts to an incomplete version of EM. To accept a weak BC approach to concepts is to accept concept-empiricism. I raise four challenges for concept empiricism and argue that what is widely taken as evidence for concept-empiricism from recent cognitive neuroscience could only vindicate weak BC if it could be shown that the non-neural body, far from being a tool at the service of the mind/brain, could be constitutive of the mind. If correct, EM would seem able to vindicate the claim that both bodily and non-bodily tools are constitutive of an individual's mind. I scrutinize the basic arguments for EM and argue that they fail. This failure backfires on weak BC. One option left for advocates of BC is to endorse a strong, more controversial, BC approach to concepts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{article will}} address the {{tensions}} between dualistic traditions of our culture (cf. WERTHEIM, 1999) and new ways of understanding how people come {{to know what they}} know through embodied practice within biological and social ecosystems (e. g., DAMASIO, 1994; LEAR, 1998; LEMKE, 1995; MATURANA & VARELA, 1992). It will also raise implications of a biosocial system model for research methodology and academic writing. In my Ph. D. thesis in education I demonstrated that a significant role was played in the construction of my knowledge by my body[-mind], much of it initially outside my awareness. However, I found that theses were still expected to support the myth that learning which will advance knowledge about education is almost exclusively the product of abstract and systematic logical processes, of a disembodied spirit.

40|$|As Erika Fischer-Lichte remarked, {{the great}} Polish theatre theorist Jerzy Grotowski redefined {{the notion of}} the body of the actor as an <b>embodied</b> <b>mind,</b> as a {{responsive}} and responding self. Conversely, law abjures the body, its interpreters – lawyers and scholars – inured in practices of rationality, reason and logic, or mindful disembodiment. Travelling through the Danish capital, encountering Danes real and fictitious to illustrate how much we function through our bodies, this essay suggests that we are better and more effective legal interpreters as <b>embodied</b> <b>minds,</b> rather than disembodied minds. But this is not mindless embodiment, a mere reflex or bodily outburst. The <b>embodied</b> <b>mind</b> is self-aware (physically, socially, intellectually) and possesses the same embodied virtuous morality held by Grotowski’s actors.

5000|$|Some {{suggest that}} the <b>embodied</b> <b>mind</b> serves self-regulatory {{processes}} by combining movement and cognition to reach a goal.

Some judgments, such as the emotion of a face, are detected more quickly when a participant mimics the facial expression that is being evaluated. [...] Individuals holding a pen in their mouths to freeze their facial muscles and make them unable to mimic the expression were less able to judge emotions. Goal-relevant actions may be encouraged by embodied cognition, {{as evidenced by the}} automated approach and avoidance of certain environmental cues.

50|$|As this {{response}} makes clear, Marquis's argument requires that what will later have valuable experiences and activities {{is the same}} entity, the same biological organism, as the embryo.

If either of these views is correct, Marquis's argument will fail; for the embryo (even the early fetus, lacking the relevant psychological capacities) would not itself have a future of value, but would merely have the potential to give rise to a different entity, an <b>embodied</b> <b>mind</b> or a person, that would have a future of value.

It is not formally repre-sented, but embodied knowledge which is learnt by doing and understood by bodily interacting with ecological niches and social environments.

40|$|In this essay, I {{argue that}} the late {{ontology}} of Maurice Merleau-Ponty, in particular the system he began to develop in The Visible and the Invisible, can be conceived of {{as a form of}} Radical Enactive Cognition, as described by Hutto and Myin in Radicalizing Enactivism. I will begin by discussing Clark and Chalmers’ extended mind hypothesis, as well as the enactive view of consciousness proposed by Varela, Thompson, and Rosch in The <b>Embodied</b> <b>Mind.</b> However, neither Clark and Chalmers’ extended mind hypothesis nor the enactive view of consciousness advanced by Varela et al. are radical enough to fully capture Merleau-Ponty’s late ontology. Inasmuch as Hutto and Myin’s formulation combines features of the extended <b>mind</b> <b>thesis</b> and enactivism, and expresses both in a sufficiently radical fashion, it overcomes the deficits of both theories and can serve as a translation, so to speak, of Merleau-Ponty’s “ontology of the flesh” into contemporary terms. In particular, their formulation makes explicit several central aspects of his theory: the intimate, mutually constitutive relationship between perceiver and perceived world, the equal weight given to the contributions of perceiver and world within this relationship, and the displacement of representational content from its central position in the understanding of consciousness. It is thus the ideal vehicle for demonstrating some perhaps unexpected ways in which Merleau-Ponty’s thought is compatible with contemporary conversations concerning the nature of mind...|$|R
