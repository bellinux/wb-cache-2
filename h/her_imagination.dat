25|$|She {{began to}} take opiates for the pain, {{laudanum}} (an opium concoction) followed by morphine, then commonly prescribed. She would become dependent on them for much of her adulthood; the use {{from an early age}} may well have contributed to her frail health. Biographers such as Alethea Hayter have suggested this may also have contributed to the wild vividness of <b>her</b> <b>imagination</b> and the poetry that it produced.|$|E
25|$|As an avid reader, in the Netherlands {{she found}} new books {{and ways of}} thought that both {{stretched}} <b>her</b> <b>imagination</b> and frightened her. Sigmund Freud's work introduced her to an alternative moral system that was not based on religion. During this time she took courses in Dutch and a one-year introductory course in social work at the De Horst Institute for Social Work in Driebergen. She has {{said that she was}} impressed with how well Dutch society seemed to function. To better understand its development, she studied at Leiden University, obtaining an MSc degree in political science in 2000.|$|E

25|$|During the series, {{the main}} storyline follows Alex Drake in her {{struggle}} {{to return to}} the present day. In order to do this, she believes that preventing the death of her parents, Tim (Andrew Clover) and Caroline Price (Amelia Bullmore), will enable her to return. While watching the death of her parents in the finale of the first series, she discovers that the person she remembers taking her hand as a child was Gene Hunt and not Evan White (Stephen Campbell Moore) as she previously thought. This leads her to question if Hunt is real and not a figment of <b>her</b> <b>imagination</b> as she thought.|$|E
25|$|For {{the next}} several years Sara is abused by Miss Minchin and the other servants, except for Becky. Amelia deplores how Sara is treated but is too weak to speak up about it. Sara is starved, worked for long hours, sent out in all weathers, poorly dressed in outgrown and {{worn-out}} clothes, and deprived of warmth or a comfortable bed in the attic. Despite her hardships, Sara is consoled by her friends and uses <b>her</b> <b>imagination</b> to cope, pretending she is a prisoner in the Bastille or a princess disguised as a servant. Sara also continues to be kind and polite to everyone, including those who treat her badly. One day she finds a coin in the street and uses it to buy buns at a bakery, but despite being very hungry, she gives most of the buns away to a beggar girl dressed in rags who is hungrier than herself. The bakery shop owner sees this and wants to reward Sara, but she has disappeared, so the shop owner instead gives the beggar girl bread and warm shelter for Sara's sake.|$|E
25|$|Miyazaki {{had given}} other names {{to the main}} {{character}} during development, but he settled on Nausicaä based on {{the name of the}} Greek princess of the same name from the Odyssey, as portrayed in Bernard Evslin's dictionary of Greek mythology, translated into Japanese by Minoru Kobayashi. Nausicaä’s personality was also patterned in part on Homer's character, particularly in regard to her love of nature and music, <b>her</b> <b>imagination</b> and disregard for material possessions. In his essay , printed in volume one of the manga, Miyazaki wrote that he was also inspired by The Princess who Loved Insects, a Japanese tale from the Heian period about a young princess who preferred studying insects rather than wearing fine clothes or choosing a husband. Helen McCarthy considers Shuna from The Journey of Shuna to be prototypical to Nausicaä, and Dani Cavallaro feels that Lana from Future Boy Conan and Clarisse of The Castle of Cagliostro also influenced Nausicaä’s characterization. The story’s fantasy and science fiction elements were influenced by a variety of works from Western authors, including Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea, Brian Aldiss's Hothouse, Isaac Asimov's Nightfall, and J.R.R Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings.|$|E

500|$|The Abbey was the {{original}} site on which 'Gracedieu', the setting for the Abbey Series of books by Elsie J. Oxenham, was based. [...] Many of its features described by Oxenham, who visited Cleeve {{in the early years}} of the twentieth century, can be identified at the site today, although literary licence allowed her to add features from elsewhere or from <b>her</b> <b>imagination.</b>|$|E
500|$|Author Angie Sage {{has said}} that the {{character}} of Septimus Heap, his ultimate fate, and the world he inhabits, were fully formed in <b>her</b> <b>imagination</b> from the beginning, but she had not decided on the intermediate steps on his journey, nor on the characters he would meet. Sage described Septimus Heap's world as a place where numerous creatures and people suddenly appear and become involved in events.|$|E
500|$|The album {{experienced}} limited promotion {{during its}} release, {{with some of}} the tracks appearing during Japanese commercial endorsements. The compilation's only release was promotional song [...] "Rainbow", which was used as the theme song for Hamasaki's Japanese talk show Ayuready?, and to promote products by Lumix. An accompanying music video for the song was directed by Wataru Takeishi, featuring two clones of Hamasaki chasing each other, and eventually meeting at a dinner in Japan. Near the end of the video, it is revealed that the second clone is in fact <b>her</b> <b>imagination</b> or conscious.|$|E

With a sudden flash and movement, he raised himself in the bed; she rushed toward him, and clasped him with agonized kisses.|$|R

500|$|As Madonna {{finishes}} {{singing the}} intermediate lines, [...] "Close your eyes, sleepy-head, It {{is time for}} your bed, Never forget what I said, Hang on...", a trumpet starts playing alongside the main rhythm. The breakdown has the feel of Spanish music, with the glissando evoking the string arrangements. This {{is followed by the}} bridge and the chorus being repeated twice. [...] "Dear Jessie" [...] ends with all instrumentation and vocals fading out, except the orchestra, which is equalized to make it sound very thin and trebly, as if coming out from a distorted radio. The lyrics encourage the little girl Jessie to use <b>her</b> <b>imagination.</b> It summons up a psychedelic landscape, where pink elephants roam with dancing moons and mermaids. It references fairy-tale characters and creates an image of children playing with each other.|$|E
500|$|Love. Angel. Music. Baby. {{introduced}} the Harajuku Girls, an entourage of four Japanese women whom Stefani {{referred to as}} a figment of <b>her</b> <b>imagination.</b> The Harajuku Girls are discussed in several of the songs, including one named after and entirely dedicated to them. They appear in most of the music videos produced for the album and those for Stefani's second album The Sweet Escape (2006). Love. Angel. Music. Baby. includes various styles of music. Many songs are influenced by electro beats designed for club play. Producers Austin and Kanal incorporated R into the song [...] "Luxurious" [...] which contains a sample of The Isley Brothers' 1983 single [...] "Between the Sheets". Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis incorporate new jack swing, a fusion genre of R that the pair had developed and popularized during the mid-1980s.|$|E
500|$|... "It {{proved a}} wet, ungenial summer", Mary Shelley remembered in 1831, [...] "and incessant rain often {{confined}} us for {{days to the}} house". Sitting around a log fire at Byron's villa, the company amused themselves with German ghost stories, which prompted Byron to propose that they [...] "each write a ghost story". Unable {{to think of a}} story, young Mary Godwin became anxious: [...] "Have you thought of a story? I was asked each morning, and each morning I was forced to reply with a mortifying negative." [...] During one mid-June evening, the discussions turned {{to the nature of the}} principle of life. [...] "Perhaps a corpse would be re-animated", Mary noted, [...] "galvanism had given token of such things".

500|$|Although {{the singer}} has never {{mentioned}} physical abuse in her family, she had mentioned {{that her father}} was a disciplinarian and her stepmother was hard on her. Author Lucy O'Brien wrote in her book Madonna: Like an Icon that the song stemmed more from the emotional neglect that Madonna faced, with her father locked up in grief after Mrs. Ciccone died. When he married again, his new wife was wrapped up with her own children, so the older kids were often left to their own devices. O'Brien believed that for this reason, Madonna's girlhood would have been without much joy, and that [...] "Oh Father" [...] was a potent example of the singer using <b>her</b> <b>imagination</b> to escape from her troubled childhood, while blaming it on her father. Tony later said, [...] "Maybe I'm not the greatest father in the world, but life wasn't easy for us, and Nonni [...] knows all of this." ...|$|E
500|$|Initially, Howard {{dismissed}} {{the notion that}} Toft {{had given birth to}} animal parts, but the next day, despite his reservations, he went to see her. [...] Ann Toft showed him more pieces of the previous night's exertions, but on examining Mary, he found nothing. [...] When Mary again went into labour, appearing to give birth to several more animal parts, Howard returned to continue his investigations. [...] According to a contemporary account of 9November, {{over the next few days}} he delivered [...] "three legs of a Cat of a Tabby Colour, and one leg of a Rabbet: the guts were as a Cat's and in them were three pieces of the Back-Bone of an Eel... The cat's feet supposed were formed in <b>her</b> <b>imagination</b> from a cat she was fond of that slept on the bed at night." [...] Toft seemingly became ill once more and over the next few days delivered more pieces of rabbit.|$|E
500|$|For the cutscenes, the {{localization}} team {{took into}} account that the animation {{had been done to}} the Japanese lines, so they made sure that the English script matched the already set lip flaps and timing. Because the Japanese voice acting was not yet recorded when Hsu worked on the English dub script, she used <b>her</b> <b>imagination</b> to guess what the Japanese voice acting would be like based on the script; this was made easier due to her familiarity with [...] "standard anime conventions" [...] from frequently watching anime. For some dialogue, she wrote alternative lines, as the footage had not yet been finished, and the script could be interpreted in different ways: in one scene, where Phoenix speaks on the phone, Hsu had him follow the line [...] "It's for this very reason I returned" [...] with either [...] "Time to bring it to an end" [...] or [...] "To put an end to it all"; she used the former because of how there was a dramatic pause between the two lines.|$|E
