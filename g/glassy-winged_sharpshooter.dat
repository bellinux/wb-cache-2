40|$|A permit was {{obtained}} from EPA in late spring to conduct field trials in covered grapevines at three commercial vineyards and one experiment station in California. Alcaligenes xylosoxidans denitrificans (Axd) bacteria, modified to produce a fluorescent protein, were applied to grapevines by needle inoculation, foliar spray application, and soil drench. The plants were covered with insect-free screening, to exclude arthropods from test plants. Samples were taken throughout the growing season and are currently being processed. Grapevines at the Riverside field site were exposed to <b>glassy-winged</b> <b>sharpshooters</b> to test the affect of insect feeding on the translocation of Axd in grapevines.

50|$|Their feeding method, {{along with}} their {{voracious}} appetite for so many different hosts, makes <b>glassy-winged</b> <b>sharpshooters</b> an effective vector for the Xylella fastidiosa bacterium. Once they feed on an infected plant, X. fastidiosa colonizes the sharpshooter by forming a biofilm on its mouth-parts. The sharpshooter then transmits the disease to additional plants while feeding. A plant that is not affected {{by any of the}} diseases caused by X. fastidiosa becomes a reservoir, holding the bacterium for other sharpshooters to pick up and carry to other plants. X. fastidiosa is linked to many plant diseases, including phoney peach disease in the southern United States, oleander leaf scorch and Pierce's disease in California, and citrus X disease in Brazil.|$|R

40|$|The neonicotinoids {{are highly}} {{effective}} insecticides {{for the management}} of <b>glassy-winged</b> <b>sharpshooters</b> GWSS). The systemic activity of the insecticides exploits the feeding behavior of the sharpshooter at all life stages. Imidacloprid was also toxic to the egg stages. This toxicity was manifested at the time of emergence of the 1 st instar from the egg mass, and not during the development of the embryo. Imidacloprid metabolites were found to be effective against adult and egg stages of the sharpshooter. In accordance with data from studies on aphids and whiteflies, the olefin and 5 -hydroxy metabolites were most toxic, while the desnitro and diol derivatives lacked any toxic effect. Metabolites were detected in the xylem fluid extracted from citrus trees that had been treated with Admire. The source of these metabolites is not yet clear – they may originate from imidacloprid metabolism within the soil before uptake by the trees, or they may have been formed within the trees themselves. Nevertheless, our results confirm that sharpshooters feeding on citrus will encounter imidacloprid metabolites that will contribute to its toxicity. We are currently evaluating the metabolic fate of the other neonicotinoids...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of vectored diseases {{are governed by}} the interplay {{of a variety of}} biotic and abiotic factors. We studied some of these factors that are expected to be important to the epidemiology of Pierce’s disease (PD) in California vineyards. We conducted a series of greenhouse transmission experiments to quantify how sharpshooter species, sharpshooter number, plant inoculation access period, and temperature affect transmission of Xylella fastidiosa (Xf) to grapes and PD symptom development. For the blue-green sharpshooter (BGSS), vector number and inoculation period had similar strong effects on infection rate. Interestingly, larger numbers and longer inoculation periods increased the onset of PD symptoms. However, while the number of <b>glassy-winged</b> <b>sharpshooters</b> (GWSS) increased infection rate, inoculation access period did not. In a final experiment looking at the relationship between temperature and transmission efficiency, high temperature (30 oC) resulted in low BGSS survival yet marginally higher infection rate. Moreover, Xf population in vines was positively related to the number of vectors that tested positive for Xf using realtime PCR at the time of plant inoculation. These results suggest that high sharpshooter numbers may not only increase transmission rate but also decrease incubation period – presumably because of a larger inoculum. We expect that high vector densities and temperatures will increase the rate of disease cycling, which is particularly relevant to disease prevalence in this system...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>glassy-winged</b> <b>sharpshooter</b> {{feeds on}} a wide variety of plants. Scientists {{estimate}} the host plants for this sharpshooter include over 70 different plant species. Among the hosts are grapes, citrus trees, almonds, stone fruit, and oleanders. Because of the large number of hosts, <b>glassy-winged</b> <b>sharpshooter</b> populations are able to flourish in both agricultural and urban areas. They feed on a plant by inserting their needle-like mouth parts into the plant's xylem. While feeding, sharpshooters squirt small droplets of waste from the anus (filtered xylem fluid, basically water with trace solutes, especially carbohydrates), often called [...] "leafhopper rain." [...] These droplets are messy and, when the water evaporates, leave a residue that gives plants and fruit a whitewashed appearance.|$|E

40|$|Determine target {{thresholds}} for systemic neonicotinoids against <b>glassy-winged</b> <b>sharpshooters</b> in grapevines Activity Since {{the last}} progress report, we have focused our efforts on evaluating {{the efficacy of}} systemic dinotefuran against the egg stage of the GWSS. The method we use {{to do this is}} based on a published method (Byrne and Toscano, 2007) where we defined the lethal concentrations of imidacloprid to the 1 st instar nymphs as they emerged from the egg mass. GWSS adults are allowed to lay eggs on cotton plants in cages. The leaves containing the eggs are excised from the plant and the petiole placed in a vial containing a known concentration of insecticide. The uptake of insecticide into the leaves is quantified gravimetrically, and then the progress of nymph development is monitored until emergence (timed according to nymph development on control leaves without pesticide pressure). The development of eggs is determined for different pesticide concentrations, so that a dose-mortality line can be developed (as for imidacloprid). Results The process by which dinotefuran affects the GWSS egg is similar to what we observed for imidacloprid. The dinotefuran does not penetrate the chorion of the egg. However, if the concentration of dinotefuran is high enough in the leaf, the nymph will contact the insecticide during emergence. We have observed death at all stages during emergence. Some nymphs succumb immediately they break through the chorion, while others manage to emerge fully, allowing the cuticle to dry and form the typical darkened color...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{continuation}} of the epidemiology project that was initiated in 2001 in the Coachella Valley. Surveys in 2001 did not detect any Pierce’s disease (PD). In 2002, we identified 2 infected vines in one vineyard and 1 infected vine in an adjacent vineyard. These were the first finds of PD in the area since 1983. Intensive surveys in these vineyards over the past 3 years have revealed a total of 16 infected vines. In June 2003, we found PD-infected vines in 2 additional vineyards. Further work in these vineyards has identified a total of 62 vines infected with PD. This past summer (2004), we again surveyed all vineyards in the Valley, finding PD-infected vines at 3 additional sites. Additional searches have identified a total of 19 infected vines in these three vineyards. With the finds this past summer, we now have identified 97 PD-infected vines from 7 vineyards. Except for the two infected vineyards identified in 2002, sharpshooter densities have been low near the sites that have PD. Since the inception of this project in May 2001, we have used yellow sticky traps to monitor the spatial and temporal abundance of adult <b>glassy-winged</b> <b>sharpshooters</b> (GWSS), Homoladisca coagulata (Say) and native smoke tree sharpshooters (STSS), Homoladisca liturata Ball in the Valley.

40|$|A computer-monitored flight mill was {{developed}} to study the effects on insect flight of sub-lethal dosages of soil-applied imidacloprid (Admire 2 F, 21. 4 % AI) to <b>glassy-winged</b> <b>sharpshooters</b> (GWSS) in laboratory cages. Adult sharpshooters were glued to a 10 cm radius plastic arm that rotated on a pivot. The rotations per minute were recorded and tabulated by computer. The range of distances flown on flight mills by adult GWSS not exposed to insecticide treatment (negative controls) ranged from 8 m to 6, 843 meters and averaged 3, 853 m for males and 2, 537 m for females. Over 90 % {{of males and females}} flew at least 60 m (“fliers”) during the 6 - 12 hour flight trials. More than 9 % of total distances flown by individual fliers occurred within 4 hours. Imidacloprid at sub-lethal dosages (9 % mortality in 24 hours vs. 3 % of untreated controls) that inhibit feeding did not reduce flight performance significantly, but dosages that killed 33 % of the GWSS in 24 hours reduced flight in the surviving insects. Insects that had fed on insecticide-treated plants for 24 hours flew much less (fewer fliers), yet among those that did fly, the differences were not statistically significant. At 3. 2 mg imidacloprid in 500 g soil, on average, one-third were killed after 24 hours, and less than 50 % of the survivors flew. However, there were occasional “outliers ” that could fly just as well as, or sometimes more than, the control insects. Whether these individuals were resistant to imidacloprid or survived and flew as a result of uneven uptake of the insecticide by different replicate plants was not clear.

[...] The disease is endemic in northern California, being spread by the blue-green sharpshooter, which only attacks grapevines that are adjacent to riparian habitats. It became a real threat to California's wine industry when the <b>glassy-winged</b> <b>sharpshooter</b> (GWSS), native to the southeast United States, {{was discovered}} in the Temecula Valley in California in 1996. The GWSS spreads PD much more extensively than other vectors do.

No cure has yet been found, but the understanding of Xylella fastidiosa and <b>glassy-winged</b> <b>sharpshooter</b> biology has increased much since 2000, when the California Department of Food and Agriculture, in collaboration with different universities, such as University of California, Davis (UC Davis); University of California, Berkeley, and University of California, Riverside, and the University of Houston-Downtown started to focus their research on this pest. The research explores the different aspects of the disease propagation from the vector to the host plant and within the host plant, to the impact of the disease on California's economy.

Prior to laying eggs, the female places masses of such brochosomes onto its forewings, and later scrapes them off onto the freshly laid eggs with its hindlegs. [...] The resulting powdery coat may serve various protective functions, including protection against egg-parasitoids from the order Hymenoptera (Chalcidoidea).

50|$|Successful efforts using {{integrated}} {{pest management}} (IPM) of the <b>glassy-winged</b> <b>sharpshooter</b> {{include the use of}} insecticides, parasitoids (especially wasps in the family Mymaridae), and the impact of naturally occurring pathogens like viruses, bacteria, and fungi. One of the newly discovered pathogens is a virus specific to sharpshooters. The leafhopper-infecting virus, Homalodisca coagulata virus-1 (HoCV-1, Dicistroviridae), has been shown to increase leafhopper mortality. The virus occurs in nature and is spread most readily at high population densities through contact among infected individuals, contact with virus-contaminated surfaces, and/or as an aerosol in leafhopper excreta. One of the most successful biocontrol efforts has been the mass rearing and release of four different leafhopper parasitoids (in the mymarid genus Gonatocerus), which have been very successful in reducing the number of eggs that survive. The traditional means of insect management, such as scouting and land owner reports of leafhopper presence, followed by highly focused insecticide treatments, have also been of great value in reducing leafhopper numbers; all of these impacts have produced a system wherein reasonable, environmentally sound management of this insect pest is being maintained.|$|E
