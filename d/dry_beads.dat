40|$|The {{kinetics}} {{of metal}} uptake by gel and dry calcium alginate beads was analysed using solutions of copper or lead ions. Gel beads sorbed metal ions {{faster than the}} dry ones and larger diffusivities of metal ions were calculated for gel beads: approximately 10 − 4 cm 2 /min vs. 10 − 6 cm 2 /min for <b>dry</b> <b>beads.</b> In accordance, scanning electron microscopy and nitrogen adsorption data revealed a low porosity of dry alginate particles. However, <b>dry</b> <b>beads</b> showed higher sorption capacities and a mechanical stability more suitable for large-scale use. Two sorption models were fitted to the kinetic results: the Lagergren pseudo-first order and the Ho and McKay pseudo-second order equations. The former {{was found to be}} the most adequate to model metal uptake by dry alginate beads and kinetic constants in the orders of 10 − 3 and 10 − 2 min− 1 were obtained for lead solutions with concentrations up to 100 g/m 3.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this work was to develop and characterise {{magnetic}} micro-matrices for covalent immobilisation of enzymes. As a model biocatalyst penicillin amidase from E. coli - an enzyme of high industrial importance {{for the production of}} semi-synthetic b-lactam antibiotics, was used. Poly(vinylacetate) (PVAc) and poly(methylacrylate) (PMA) magnetic beads of sizes in a range 2 - 20 µm were synthesised by an oil-in-water suspension polymerisation method. Cross-linked poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) beads of 6 µm diameter were converted into magnetic particles by a swell-deswell manufacturing procedure in a toluene-based magnetic fluid comprising of nano-crystals of magnetite covered by a bi-layer of surfactant. Amino-silanised magnetic particles of 1 - 2 µm diameter were produced by co-precipitation of Fe(II) and Fe(III) salts at high alkaline pH and covered by amino-silane and finally by poly(glutaraldehyde) layers. Poly(vinylalcohol) beads under the trade name M-PVA, of 1 - 3 µm diameter, were donated by chemagen Biopolymer Technologie AG and largely studied here. All of the magnetic matrices investigated had sizes in a range of 1 - 20 µm and showed superparamagnetic behaviour e. g. no magnetic memory effects once they were set out of an external magnetic field. Modification of the magnetic bead surfaces mainly with epoxy-, or amino- and subsequent aldehyde- spacers, was done in order to create sites, suitable for the covalent immobilisation of enzymes. Penicillin amidase from E. coli was covalently immobilised onto magnetic matrices investigated in this work via different spacers/reactions. For M-PVA commercial beads, with increasing of the spacer length an increase in the amount of the covalently bound active protein, of up to 22 mg enzyme per gram <b>dry</b> <b>beads</b> for the functionalised with hexamethylene diamine / glutardialdehyde (20. 8 Å length) spacer matrix at low (0. 2 M) ionic strength of the immobilisation buffer was observed. For comparable immobilisation conditions, the same carrier with shorter (6. 0 Å length) epoxy-spacer immobilised only 4 mg enzyme per gram <b>dry</b> <b>beads.</b> Comparable results were obtained for subsequently modified amino-silanised magnetic particles with a different number of hexamethylene diamine / glutardialdehyde �spacer units� at the above-mentioned low ionic strength of the immobilisation buffer. For the last matrix an immobilisation maximum of 74 mg enzyme per gram <b>dry</b> <b>beads</b> at four spacer units (64. 9 Å length) was evaluated. This result was also the maximum enzyme loading obtained with the magnetic matrices studied here for the chosen biocatalyst and immobilisation conditions. For poly(vinylacetate) magnetic beads with increasing spacer length from 6. 0 Å (epoxy-spacer) to up to 21. 0 Å (hexamethylene diamine / glutardialdehyde spacer), the amount of the immobilised active penicillin amidase increased from 3 to up to 24 mg·g- 1 <b>dry</b> <b>beads.</b> Furthermore, for M-PVA magnetic beads the influence of the immobilisation buffer ionic strength on the achievable enzyme loadings was more pronounced for the matrices modified with shorter epoxy- (epichlorohydrine) and imidazolyl-carbamate (N,N´-carbonyl diimidazole) spacers. For both spacers a significant increase - of almost three folds of the amount of the covalently bound enzyme, with rising ionic strength of up to 1 M, was observed. This can be due to minimising of un-desirable charge-charge interactions between the matrix surface (negative zeta potential at pH 7. 5 determined) and the enzyme molecule (negative charge at pH 7. 5) during the immobilisation process. It is logical, that the effect of the ionic strength was more significant {{in the case of the}} above-mentioned shorter spacers, which means shorter distances and stronger electrostatic repulsions between the matrix and the enzyme. Amino-modified and further glutardialdehyde-functionalised poly(methylacrylate) magnetic beads showed enzyme loading capacities comparable to those obtained with the commercial M-PVA matrices at similar immobilisation conditions. With a prolongation of the immobilisation reaction time from 24 h to 72 h, the amount of bound penicillin amidase increased from 35 to 54 mg per gram <b>dry</b> <b>beads.</b> The apparent kinetic constants Km and kcat of the penicillin amidase from E. coli covalently immobilised onto the studied magnetic matrices were investigated here for the hydrolysis of penicillin G. The evaluated apparent Km constants were several fold higher compared to the one for the free enzyme, but were one or two orders of magnitude lower compared to those for penicillin amidase bound onto larger (> 100 µm) porous carriers. The selectivity of the enzyme immobilised onto M-PVA beads was investigated in kinetically controlled synthesis of cephalexin from R-phenylglycine amide and 7 -aminodeacetoxycephalosporanic acid at 5 °C and an excess of nucleophile. The observed immobilised enzyme selectivity, calculated as nsyn/nhyd= 8 was comparable to this of the free penicillin amidase from E. coli e. g. nsyn/nhyd= 13. Enantioselectivity of the penicillin amidase from E. coli immobilised onto different magnetic matrices was studied for the equilibrium controlled hydrolysis of racemic phenylacetylphenylalanine and kinetically controlled condensation of R-phenylglycine amide with pure enantiomers or racemic mixture of phenylalanine. All studied enzymes, immobilised onto magnetic micro-particles, showed Ehyd,rac > 100 for the investigated hydrolysis reaction...|$|E

The effect of pectin concentration on bead size, circularity, swelling behavior, and mechanical properties, {{as well as in}} vitro drug release profile was investigated. The mechanical properties of calcium pectinate beads were determined by a micromanipulation technique. The drug release profile was measured using a standard British Pharmacopoeia method. It was found that the beads made of higher pectin concentration in general had a less permeable matrix structure and greater mechanical rigidity, although they swelled more after hydration. However, such an effect was not significant when the pectin concentration was increased to above 8 %. Micromanipulation measurements showed that there was significant relaxation of the force being imposed on single hydrated beads when they were held, but this phenomenon did not occur on <b>dry</b> <b>beads,</b> which means that the force relaxation was dominated by liquid loss from the beads.

Both chicks avoided pecking at a similar but <b>dry</b> <b>bead</b> 0. 5, 3 and 24 h after the observer chick saw the actor chick peck at an MeA-coated bead. By contrast, when the actor chick had pecked at a water-coated bead, both chicks continued to peck at a <b>dry</b> <b>bead</b> at 0. 5, 3 and 24 h after training. Experiment 2 investigated whether observer chicks showed avoidance if they were prevented (by the insertion of an opaque barrier) from observing their companion pecking at the MeA-coated bead during either training or testing. Observer chicks that could not see their companion during training but could observe the actor chicks at test showed no subsequent avoidance whereas chicks that observed the actor chick at training, but not during testing, showed high levels of avoidance. Although the sensory cues (visual, auditory or olfactory) or types of behaviour (i. e. levels of pecking or head shaking) that the observer chick used to maintain avoidance remain unclear, the results show that chicks can learn about an aversive object by observing the responses of a conspecific.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) defines emerging pollutants as new chemicals without regulatory status {{and with an}} impact on the environment and human health that is poorly understood. Bisphenol A (BPA) has been considered an EDC and found to be ubiquitous in the environment because of its presence in a multitude of products including food and beverage packaging, flame retardants, adhesives, building materials, electronic components, and paper coatings Currently, BPA is not regulated by the federal government in the US and waste water treatment plants are not designed nor required to remove it. As wastewater effluent for drinking water use becomes a reality in our society, it warrants a need to develop methods to effectively remove BPA from wastewater.

Beads were produced by prilling (laminar jet break-up) using different polymer concentrations and loaded with ketoprofen, a slightly soluble non-steroidal anti-inflammatory BCS class II drug characterized by low melting point. MW assisted treatments applied using different irradiating conditions were performed as drying/curing step. The effect of formulation conditions and process variables on drying kinetics, particle micromeritics, shape, surface and inner characteristics of the matrix as well as drug loading and drug release behaviour was studied (USP pH change method). The properties of MW dried particles were compared to those dehydrated by convective methods (room conditions and tray oven 105 ◦C). Results showed that MW <b>dried</b> ketoprofen loaded <b>beads</b> were obtained in a very narrow dimensional range retaining shape and size distribution of the hydrates particles. Compared to the traditional drying methods, MW treatments were able to strongly increase drying rate of the hydrated beads achieving faster and controllable dehydration kinetics. Moreover, different regimes of irradiation affected structural properties of the particles such as matrix porosity {{as well as the}} solid state of the loaded drug. DSC, X-ray and FTIR analyses indicated complex chemical interactions between the drug and polymer matrix induced by MW, related with the regime of irradiation, that contributes to the differences in release profiles. In fact, MW treatments under different time and irradiating regimes are able to modulate drug release from alginate beads; high levels of irradiation led to beads suitable for immediate release oral dosage forms whereas the lowest regime of irradiation led to beads that achieved a prolonged/sustained release of the drug till 8 h in simulated intestinal medium. This study showed that prilling in combination with microwave treatments is a useful and simple tandem technique to prepare dextran-based <b>dried</b> <b>beads...</b>|$|R
30|$|Pesticides {{are used}} {{extensively}} worldwide, {{which has led}} to the unwanted contamination of soil and water resources. Former use of the herbicide 2, 6 -dichlorobenzonitrile (dichlobenil) has caused pollution of ground and surface water resources by the stable degradation product 2, 6 -dichlorobenzamide (BAM) in several parts of Europe, which has resulted in the costly closure of several drinking water wells. One strategy for preventing this in future is bioaugmentation using bacterial degraders. BAM-degrading Aminobacter sp. MSH 1 was therefore formulated into <b>dried</b> <b>beads</b> and tests undertaken to establish their potential for use in the remediation of polluted soil, sand and water. The formulation procedure included freeze drying, combined with trehalose addition for cell wall protection, thus ensuring a high amount of viable cells following prolonged storage at room temperature. The beads were round-shaped pellets with a diameter of about 1.25  mm, a dry matter content of approximately 95  % and an average viable cell content of 4.4  ×  109 cells/g bead. Formulated MSH 1 cells led to a similar, and frequently even faster, BAM mineralisation (20 – 65  % 14 CO 2 produced from 14 C-labelled BAM) in batch tests conducted with sand, water and different soil moisture contents compared to adding free cells. Furthermore, the beads were easy to handle and had a shelf life of several months.|$|R
40|$|Neurotrophins {{have been}} implicated in memory {{consolidation}} and recall {{as well as in}} other forms of neural plasticity. This study examined the effects of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and Neurotrophin- 3 (NT- 3) on consolidation of memory for a one-trial passive avoidance task in day-old chicks. In this task chicks, having pecked once at a bitter tasting bead, avoid a similar but <b>dry</b> <b>bead</b> subsequently. Intracerebral administration of antisense ODNs to BDNF 6 - 12 h prior to training induced amnesia for the avoidance response by 3 h after training. Administration of a "control" scrambled sequence or saline had no effect on recall; chicks continued to avoid the bead. Treatment with BDNF-AS did not inhibit shorter-term recall; amnesia was not present 1 h after training, but prevented longer-term recall, as amnesia was still present 24 h after training. Treatment with BDNF-antisense reduced both BDNF mRNA and BDNF protein in the chick brain, but did not alter mRNA levels of glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase. By contrast, no effect of antisense to NGF or NT- 3 on behaviour was observed, even though administration reduced the mRNA for each. There were no significant effects of any antisense on other behavioural measures at the doses used. Thus we conclude that BDNF has a specific role in memory consolidation for the passive avoidance task. Eskitis, Inst Cell&Molecular TherapiesNo Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|Alginate/bacterial {{cellulose}} nanocomposite beads, with well-controlled {{size and}} regular spherical shapes, were prepared {{in a simple}} manner by entrapping Gluconacetobacter xylinus in barium alginate hydrogel beads, followed by cultivation of the entrapped cells in culture media with a low sodium ion concentration. The entire surface of the alginate hydrogel beads containing the cells was covered with cellulose fibers (∼ 30  nm) after 36  h of cultivation. The cellulose crystallinity index of the alginate/bacterial cellulose beads was 0. 7, which was slightly {{lower than that of}} bacterial cellulose prepared by cultivating dispersed cells. The water vapor sorption capacity of the alginate/bacterial cellulose beads increased significantly from 0. 07 to 38. 00 (g/g <b>dry</b> <b>bead)</b> as cultivation time increased. These results clearly indicate that alginate/bacterial cellulose beads have a much higher surface area, crystallinity, and water-holding capacity than alginate beads. The immobilization of lipase {{on the surface of the}} nanocomposite beads was also investigated as a potential application of this system. The activity and specific activity of lipase immobilized on alginate/bacterial cellulose beads were 2. 6 - and 3. 8 -fold higher, respectively, than that of lipase immobilized on cellulose beads. The alginate/bacterial cellulose nanocomposite beads prepared in this study have several potential applications in the biocatalytic, biomedical, and pharmaceutical fields because of their biocompatibility, biodegradability, high crystallinity, and large surface area. clos...|$|R

30|$|The metal nanoparticless {{synthesized}} in APCA/alginate mixtures were {{in form of}} a colloidal solution. To form beads {{the required}} amount of solution was taken in a burette. The flow rate was adjusted to 20 drops per minute. In another beaker a concentrated solution of calcium chloride (0.02  M) was taken on a magnetic stirrer assembly. The concentration of the calcium ions in solution was high enough for immediate bead formation even {{in the presence of}} the APCAs up to 0.001  M. The drops from the burette were allowed to fall into the calcium chloride solution while the solution was stirred very gently. The volume of calcium chloride solution was kept high (50  ml) to avoid hindrance and clashing during the bead formation. A glass-coated stirring bead was used to stir the solution. The distance between the tip of burette and the liquid surface was typically 5  cm. The beads were formed as soon as the gold sol came into contact with the calcium chloride solution. Optically transparent colored beads of about 3  mm size were obtained by this method. The color of beads was the color of the parent metal sol used and it varied from ruby red, pink to blue. The beads were allowed to equilibrate for 12  h followed by 3 – 4 times washing with Millipore water. The formed beads can be stored under water for weeks in refrigerator.

40|$|Oil-soluble {{components}} can be encapsulated in an O/W 1 /W 2 microsystem, {{in which}} they are dissolved in oil droplets dispersed in a gelled microbead (W 1), which forms a barrier between the oil droplets and the aqueous continuous phase (W 2). We investigated the rate and mechanism of breakdown of protein microbeads in a simulated gastric system, and studied the influence of microbead protein concentration, gelling method (cold-set, slow and fast heat-set), and further processing (freeze-drying), on the breakdown process. Breakdown rate decreased with increasing protein content of the beads, for the same method of production. Due to the porosity of the slowly-heated heat-set beads, breakdown occurred evenly throughout the entire bead. Cold-set microbeads of 10 % protein broke down slightly slower than the heat-set microbeads of 15 %. The denser surface of the 10 % beads slowed down the diffusion of the enzymes into the bead's interior, causing the beads to be broken down from the outside inward. All these beads broke down within one hour. Increasing the rate of temperature increase during the heating step dramatically slowed breakdown. There was no significant breakdown of rapidly heated beads within 138 minutes, even though no difference in microstructure between rapidly and slowly heated beads was visible with electron microscopy. Freeze-drying of the beads also slowed their breakdown. After 132 minutes more than half the measured particle volume of were intact beads. Freeze-drying changed the microstructure of the beads irreversibly: rehydrating the <b>dried</b> <b>beads</b> did not result in a breakdown behaviour similar to that of unprocessed beads...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT—Newly hatched chicks will spontaneously peck at {{conspicuous}} {{objects in}} their field of view, and soon learn to distinguish between edible food particles and unpleasant tasting objects. To examine whether the selective pecking {{is based on the}} ability to memorize shapes, we analyzed pecking behavior of 1 - to 2 -days-old quail chicks (Coturnix japonica) by using ball- and triangle-shaped beads both painted in green. Repeated presentation of <b>dry</b> <b>bead</b> (either ball or triangle) resulted in a progressively fewer number of pecks (habituation). When chicks were tested by triangle after repeated presentation of ball, chicks showed {{a significant increase in the}} number of pecks at the triangle (dishabituation). On the other hand, when tested by ball after a series of triangle presentations, pecking frequency did not increase (no dishabituation). Chicks thus distinguished the triangle as a novel object after being habituated to ball, but did not respond to the ball after triangle. A similar asymmetry was found in one-trial passive avoidance task. Chicks were pre-trained by water-coated (neutral) triangle and then trained by methylanthranilate-coated (aversive) ball. In this case, most chicks learned to avoid the ball, and half of these successful learners pecked at the triangle; they distinguished triangle from ball. When chicks were pre-trained by neutral ball and trained by aversive tri-angle, on the other hand, most chicks did not distinguish the ball from triangle, and showed a generalized avoidance for both beads. Chicks may be innately predisposed to memorize a limited category of shapes such as ball, and associate them with selective avoidance...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{present a}} tandem technique, {{based on the}} {{combination}} of prilling and microwave (MW) assisted treatments, to produce biodegradable alginate carriers of piroxicam with different drug controlled release behaviour. Results showed that alginate/piroxicam beads demonstrated high encapsulation efficiency and very narrow dimensional distribution. <b>Beads</b> <b>dried</b> by MW retained shape and size distribution of the hydrated particles while drying rate was strongly increased compared to convective drying processes. Moreover, different MW irradiation regimes promoted interactions between the drug and alginate matrix, affected drug polymorphism as well as inner and surface matrix structure leading to different piroxicam release profiles. High level MW irradiation led to beads with highly porous and swellable matrix able to release piroxicam in few minutes in the intestine while convective <b>drying</b> produced gastro-resistant <b>beads</b> that exhibit sustained piroxicam release (total release in 5. 5 hours) in intestinal environment.
