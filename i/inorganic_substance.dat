6000|$|The blood-red forked tentacle, {{thrown out}} of the neck of the larvae of the genus Papilio when alarmed, is, no doubt, a {{protection}} against the attacks of ichneumons, and may, perhaps, also frighten small birds; and the habit of turning up the tail possessed by the harmless rove-beetles (Staphylinidae), giving the idea that they can sting, has, probably, a similar use. Even an unusual angular form, like a crooked twig or <b>inorganic</b> <b>substance,</b> may be protective; as Mr. Poulton thinks is the case with the curious caterpillar of Notodonta ziczac, which, by means of a few slight protuberances on its body, is able to assume an angular and very unorganic-looking appearance. But perhaps the most perfect example of this kind of protection is exhibited by the large caterpillar of the Royal Persimmon moth (Bombyx regia), a native of the southern states of North America, and known there as the [...] "Hickory-horned devil." [...] It is a large green caterpillar, often six inches long, ornamented with an immense crown of orange-red tubercles, which, if disturbed, it erects and shakes from side to side in a very alarming manner. In its native country the negroes believe it to be as deadly as a rattlesnake, whereas it is perfectly innocuous. The green colour of the body suggests that its ancestors were once protectively coloured; but, growing too large to be effectually concealed, it acquired the habit of shaking its head about in order to frighten away its enemies, and ultimately developed the crown of tentacles as an addition to its terrifying powers. This species is beautifully figured in Abbott and Smith's Lepidopterous Insects of Georgia.|$|E
6000|$|There {{are some}} plants which appear to derive all their {{food from the}} air--which need nothing but a slight grasp of the ground to fix them in their place. Yet {{if we were to}} tie them into that place, in a framework, and cut them from their roots, they would die. Not only in these, but in all other plants, the vital power by which they shape and feed themselves, {{whatever}} that power may be, depends, I think, on that slight touch of the earth, and strange inheritance of its power. It is as essential to the plant's life as the connection of the head of an animal with its body by the spine is to the animal. Divide the feeble nervous thread, and all life ceases. Nay, in the tree the root is even of greater importance. You will not kill the tree, as you would an animal, by dividing its body or trunk. The part not severed from the root will shoot again. But in the root, and its touch of the ground, is the life of it. My own definition of a plant would be [...] "a living creature whose source of vital energy is in the earth" [...] (or in the water, as a form of the earth; that is, in <b>inorganic</b> <b>substance).</b> There is, however, one tribe of plants which seems nearly excepted from this law. It is a very strange one, having long been noted for the resemblance of its flowers to different insects; and it has recently been proved by Mr. Darwin to be dependent on insects for its existence. Doubly strange therefore, it seems, that in some cases this race of plants all but reaches the independent life of {34} insects. It rather settles upon boughs than roots itself in them; half of its roots may wave in the air.|$|E

Mr. F. Buckland found 6,867,840 eggs in a cod-fish ('Land and Water' 1868 page 62). An Ascaris produces about 64,000,000 eggs (Carpenter's 'Comp. Phys.' 1854 page 590). Mr. J. Scott, of the Royal Botanic Garden of Edinburgh, calculated, {{in the same manner}} as I have done for some British Orchids ('Fertilisation of Orchids' page 344), the number of seeds in a capsule of an Acropera and found the number to be 371,250. Now this plant produces several flowers on a raceme, and many racemes during a season. In an allied genus, Gongora, Mr. Scott has seen twenty capsules produced on a single raceme; ten such racemes on the Acropera would yield above seventy-four millions of seed.), the number and minuteness of the gemmules must be something inconceivable. But considering how minute the molecules are, and how many go to the formation of the smallest granule of any ordinary substance, this difficulty with respect to the gemmules is not insuperable. From the data arrived at by Sir W. Thomson, my son George finds that a cube of 1/10000 of an inch of glass or water must consist of between 16 million millions, and 131 thousand million million molecules. No doubt the molecules of which an organism is formed are larger, from being more complex, than those of an <b>inorganic</b> <b>substance,</b> and probably many molecules go to the formation of a gemmule; but when we bear in mind that a cube of 1/10000 of an inch is much smaller than any pollen-grain, ovule or bud, we can see what a vast number of gemmules one of these bodies might contain.|$|E

50|$|As STPP is an <b>inorganic</b> <b>substance,</b> {{biodegradation}} {{studies are}} not applicable. However, STPP can be hydrolysed, finally to orthophosphate, {{which can be}} assimilated by algae and/or by micro-organisms. STPP thus ends up being assimilated into the natural phosphorus cycle. Reliable published studies confirm biochemical understanding, showing that STPP is progressively hydrolysed by biochemical activity in contact with waste waters (in sewerage pipes and within sewage works) {{and also in the}} natural aquatic environment. This information enabled the calculation of “worst case” predicted environmental concentrations using the EUSES model and the HERA detergent scenario. A default regional release of 10% was applied instead of the 7% regional release indicated in the HERA detergent scenario. Reliable acute aquatic ecotoxicity studies are available which show that STPP is not toxic to aquatic organisms: all EC/LC50 values are above 100 mg/l (Daphnia, fish, algae). Because of this, and because of the only temporary presence of STPP in the aquatic environment (due to hydrolysis), no studies have been carried out to date concerning the chronic effects of STPP on these aquatic organisms.

50|$|The {{inorganic}} {{phase separation}} methods are diverse and vary greatly {{depending on the}} application. The most common method uses {{the growth of a}} crystal of one <b>inorganic</b> <b>substance</b> on or from another inorganic nanoparticle. A unique method has been developed by Gu et al., where iron-platinum nanoparticles were coated with sulfur reacted with cadmium acetylacetonate, trioctylphosphineoxide, and hexadecane-1,2-diol at 100 °C to produce nanoparticles with an iron-platinum core and an amorphous cadmium-sulfur shell. The mixture was then heated to 280 °C, resulting in a phase transition and a partial eruption of the Fe-Pt from the core, creating a pure Fe-Pt sphere attached to the CdS-coated nanoparticle. A new method of synthesizing inorganic Janus nanoparticles by phase separation has recently been developed by Zhao and Gao. In this method, they explored the use of the common homogeneous nanoparticle synthetic method of flame synthesis. They found when a methanol solution containing ferric triacetylacetonate and tetraethylorthosilicate was burned, the iron and silicon components formed an intermixed solid, which undergoes phase separation when heated to approximately 1100 °C to producemaghemite-silica Janus nanoparticles. Additionally, they found it was possible to modify the silica after producing the Janus nanoparticles, making it hydrophobic by reacting it with oleylamine.|$|E
