Tobin Bell, also making his feature film debut, plays Agent Stokes, an FBI enforcer hired by Anderson to interrogate Cowens. Bell was <b>first</b> <b>asked</b> by Parker {{to read for}} the role of Clinton Pell, a role that was ultimately given to Brad Dourif.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{pressed to}} reform the state's {{criminal}} code, {{which was based on}} the English system and imposed the death penalty for over 200 different crimes. Inspired by Thomas Jefferson's failed attempt to reform Virginia's code, he <b>first</b> <b>asked</b> the Lexington Democratic Society to study ways to make punishments more proportional to crimes in November 1793. By 1796, he was drafting a new code based on the principles that criminals should be rehabilitated, victims should be compensated for their injury, the public should be reimbursed for the cost of prosecuting the criminal, and the punishment's severity should serve as a deterrent for would-be offenders. In January 1798, he introduced his proposed code in the General Assembly. A month later, the Assembly reformed the code, abolishing the death penalty for every crime except first-degree murder.|$|E
5|$|After {{these changes}} were made, the test {{audience}} became more {{appreciative of the}} series, and GSN announced its development {{to the public at}} an upfront presentation in New York City on March 21, 2012 for the network's upcoming programming. By this time, a pilot episode had already been shot with American stand-up comedian and television personality Jeff Foxworthy performing the hosting duties for the show. When <b>first</b> <b>asked</b> if he was interested in hosting the show, Foxworthy was hesitant; he agreed to take on the role after learning that contestants would be playing for charity rather than on their own behalf. Casting for the series was held in various cities from May to June 2012. On July 7, 2012, GSN confirmed the show would premiere on August 23, 2012, alongside the premiere of Beat the Chefs.|$|E

5|$|By mid-July, Gilligan {{had been}} named as captain of the MCC team to tour Australia {{at the end of}} the English cricket season, and was {{expected}} to be one of the leading bowlers. He had, however, faced some criticism of his captaincy. Two players in the England team during the South Africa series spoke out against his tactics: Cec Parkin published a highly critical article in the press and never played for England again; George Macaulay clashed with Gilligan on the field during one Test. The consequent absence of both men from the tour substantially weakened the bowling strength of the team. Although Gilligan was generally popular for his cheerful and friendly approach, the press believed Fender to be the better captain. However, the cricket authorities at Lord's disapproved of Fender's unconventional tactics and approach. Journalists later revealed that, at some point in the season, the selectors had <b>first</b> <b>asked</b> Frank Mann to captain, but he was unable to accept the invitation.|$|E
25|$|Clark was {{attacked}} while {{walking down the}} street in Montreal in mid-November 2007.

Clark sustained a bloody nose but was not seriously hurt.|$|E

25|$|The 2011 UK Census {{showed a}} total of 57,375 Gaelic {{speakers}} in Scotland (1.1% of population over three years old), of whom only 32,400 could also read and write, {{due to the lack}} of Gaelic medium education in Scotland. Compared to the 2001 Census, there has been a diminution of approximately 1,300 people. This is the smallest drop between censuses since the Gaelic language question was <b>first</b> <b>asked</b> in 1881. The Scottish Government's language minister and Bord na Gaidhlig took this as evidence that Gaelic's long decline has slowed.|$|E
25|$|President Bush {{wrote in}} his memoirs that Olmert had <b>first</b> <b>asked</b> him to bomb the facility, but ordered the attack after Bush refused {{and told him that}} he would prefer {{diplomatic}} action and sanctions. Following the strike, Bush claimed to have suggested to Olmert to hide the strike {{for a while and then}} make it public as a way to isolate the Syrian government, but Olmert asked for total secrecy, wanting to avoid anything that could force Syria to retaliate. However, Israeli columnist Caroline Glick wrote that Israel had bowed to US demands in concealing the airstrike.|$|E
25|$|O'Connor {{was living}} in Italy in 1968 when {{producer}} Norman Lear <b>first</b> <b>asked</b> {{him to come to}} New York to star in a pilot he was creating for ABC called Justice For All, with O'Connor playing Archie Justice, a lovable yet controversial bigot. After three pilots done between 1968 and 1970, a network change to CBS, and the last name of the character changed to Bunker, the new sitcom was renamed All in the Family. The show was based on the BBC's Till Death Us Do Part, with Bunker based on Alf Garnett, but somewhat less abrasive than the original. O'Connor's Queens background and New York accent is said to have influenced Lear to set the show in Queens.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} year, she {{was cast}} as Andie Walsh in another successful Hughes film called Pretty In Pink (1986). Ringwald's role as Andie {{went on to}} become one of her most recognizable performances. When <b>first</b> <b>asked</b> to be in Pretty in Pink, Ringwald was reluctant, but after seeing how hard it was for the producers to find a replacement for her, she decided she would portray Andie in the film. Ringwald was offered a role in another John Hughes film called Some Kind of Wonderful (1987) but she turned down the role as she felt it was too similar to her other films she worked on with Hughes. After Pretty In Pink, Ringwald planned to star in more mature roles. Ringwald was later featured on the cover of Time magazine on May 26, 1986.|$|E
25|$|When <b>first</b> <b>asked</b> to {{distinguish}} between all, some, and one Genie would interpret some to mean all, but by 1975 she reversed this and began mistaking some for one, which Curtiss interpreted {{as a sign of}} progress. This contrasted with her distinction between more and less, which she had demonstrated by at least August 1973, and her understanding of the qualifiers one and all in everyday conversations. When learning relative terms such as large and small or narrow and wide she simultaneously learned both words in the pair, whereas most people acquire either the marked or the negative form first, and never mistakenly used one term in a pair to mean the other. Although she had difficulty with different pairs of relative and relational terms on tests, she showed significantly greater comprehension outside of test settings.|$|E
25|$|In {{a priori}} methods, {{preference}} information is <b>first</b> <b>asked</b> from the DM {{and then a}} solution best satisfying these preferences is found. In a posteriori methods, a representative set of Pareto optimal solutions is first found and then the DM must choose one of them. In interactive methods, the decision maker is allowed to iteratively search for the most preferred solution. In each iteration of the interactive method, the DM is shown Pareto optimal solution(s) and describes how the solution(s) could be improved. The information given by the decision maker is then taken into account while generating new Pareto optimal solution(s) for the DM to study in the next iteration. In this way, the DM learns about the feasibility of his/her wishes and can concentrate on solutions that are interesting to him/her. The DM may stop the search whenever he/she wants to. More information and examples of different methods in the four classes are given in the following sections.|$|E

25|$|On February 9, 2016, the FBI {{announced}} that it was unable to unlock one of the mobile phones they had recovered because of the phone's advanced security features. The phone was an iPhone 5C owned by the county and issued to its employee, the shooter Farook. The FBI <b>first</b> <b>asked</b> the National Security Agency to break into the phone, but the NSA was unable to do so. As a result, the FBI asked Apple Inc. to create {{a new version of the}} phone's iOS operating system that could be installed and run in the phone's random access memory to disable certain security features. Apple declined due to its policy to never undermine the security features of its products. The FBI responded by successfully applying to a United States magistrate judge, Sherri Pym, to issue a court order, mandating Apple to create and provide the requested software. The order was not a subpoena, but rather was issued under the All Writs Act of 1789.|$|E

He <b>first</b> <b>asked</b> an officer on the street to arrest him but was told to [...] "Run along home, sonny boy," [...] and so he walked into the police station. Later, on bail, he learned that a grand jury had indicted him. After the notice was given for the Japanese to evacuate, Yasui notified the authorities that he had no intentions of complying, and went to his family's home in Hood River. This violated another law restricting travel of Japanese Americans, and authorities arrested him in Hood River.|$|E

By early March, just as the Partisans were forcing a crossing of the Neretva at Jablanica, Mihailović joined Ostojić. In a letter to one of his other Montenegrin Chetnik commanders, Mihailović stated that he was managing the whole operation through Ostojić, although Mihailović later denied that {{he was in charge of}} the operation when questioned during his trial by a Partisan court after the war. Mihailović and Ostojić realised that the large concentrations of Chetnik troops in and around Mostar and the nearby bauxite mines were likely to draw German attention, and while they were focused on this issue, the Partisans forced a crossing of the Neretva.|$|E
