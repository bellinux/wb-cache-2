40|$|Use of {{combined}} {{oral contraceptives}} {{is associated with}} a three- to six-fold increased risk of venous thrombosis. Hormonal contraceptives induce acquired resistance to activated protein C (APC), which predicts the risk of venous thrombosis. The biological basis of the acquired APC resistance is unknown. Free protein S (PS) <b>and</b> <b>free</b> tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) are the two main determinants of APC. Our objective was to assess the effect of both hormonal and non-hormonal contraceptives with different routes of administration on <b>free</b> TFPI <b>and</b> <b>free</b> PS levels. We conducted an observational study in 243 users of different contraceptives and measured APC sensitivity ratios (nAPCsr), <b>free</b> TFPI <b>and</b> <b>free</b> PS levels. Users of contraceptives with the highest risk of venous thrombosis as reported in recent literature, had the lowest <b>free</b> TFPI <b>and</b> <b>free</b> PS levels, <b>and</b> vice versa, women who used contraceptives with the lowest risk of venous thrombosis had the highest <b>free</b> TFPI <b>and</b> <b>free</b> PS levels. An association was observed between levels of <b>free</b> TFPI <b>and</b> nAPCsr, <b>and</b> between <b>free</b> PS <b>and</b> nAPCsr. The effect of oral contraceptives on TFPI and PS is a possible explanation for the increased risk of venous thrombosis associated with oral contraceptives...|$|R
