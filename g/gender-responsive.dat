50|$|In a study {{conducted}} in 2007, focusing on women in prison with alcohol problems, <b>gender-responsive</b> models are noted as important.

5000|$|Abolitionists {{critical}} of <b>gender-responsive</b> prisons specifically {{contend that the}} use of <b>gender-responsive</b> prison programs propagates the myth of individual rehabilitation, and that it takes what it, in essence, structural inequality and transforms it into a problem with a prison focused solution. Abolitionist Bree Carlton expands on her criticism of <b>gender-responsive</b> programs in her article [...] "Pathways, Race and Gender Responsive Reform: Through an Abolitionist Lens". She takes a four-stagee approach’ to addressing the problem of <b>gender-responsive</b> programs specifically in Victoria, Australia; these four stages include: addressing the significance of the adoption of the ‘pathways approach’ and its use of the rehabilitation defense of prisons, discussing the constructions of race and culture in gender responsive discourses, acknowledging the disproportionate number of Vietnamese women incarcerated in Victoria and the racialized implications of the ‘pathways approach,’ and finally a reflection on the issue of prison reform.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gender-responsive</b> {{prisons are}} {{a point of}} {{contention}} in prison and criminal literature, with many pointing out that this expansion runs counter to the claims of reducing overcrowding and providing gender-specific care, because it does the opposite - <b>Gender-responsive</b> prisons increase the capacity and reach of the prison industrial complex while further damaging the lives of female non-violent offenders and their families.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gender-responsive</b> prisons provide sociocultural and {{therapeutic}} interventions through treatment and skill building within {{the criminal justice}} system.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gender-responsive</b> prisons (also {{known as}} <b>gender-responsive</b> {{corrections}} or <b>gender-responsive</b> programming) are prisons constructed {{with the intent}} of providing gender-specific care to incarcerated women. Contemporary gender-based prison programs were presented as a solution to the rapidly increasing number of women being incarcerated in the prison industrial complex and the subsequent overcrowding of California's prisons. These programs vary in intent and implementation. The use of such programs centers upon the ideology that female offenders {{in the criminal justice system}} are unique from their male counterparts, in their general personal histories and in their pathways to crime, and therefore require gender-specific rehabilitative programs. Multi-dimensional programs oriented toward ostensibly female behaviors are suggested for female offenders and are considered by many to be effective in curbing recidivism.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gender-responsive</b> prisons {{extend beyond}} the role of adults and {{continue}} {{into the realm of}} young children in detention centers. Recent research has focused on the difference in gender experience in boys and girls. In the findings, research has shown that <b>gender-responsive</b> programming works for young girls with a history of emotional trauma. A 2015 journal has noted that youth are most suitable for studies due to mental health problems related to delinquency.|$|E
5000|$|The {{history of}} the {{contemporary}} gender-responsiveness movement {{can be traced back}} to a selection of works written by Barbara Bloom and Stephanie Covington in the early 2000's. [...] Their case for, and articulation of gender-responsiveness, forms the theoretical backbone from which many others develop theories and/or criticisms of <b>gender-responsive</b> prisons. Many of the suggestions and implementation strategies forwarded in these texts were integral in constructing what we think of today as <b>gender-responsive</b> prisons.|$|E

50|$|Effective <b>gender-responsive</b> {{programs}} and interventions enhance to eliminate social {{factors such as}} racism, sexism, and economic oppression which cannot be overlooked in discussions of effective interventions for women offenders. In termes of dealing with individual issues is important to take in consideration the social issues of poverty, race and gender inequalities {{because they have a}} profound impact on women lives. Successful interventions must relate to the social realities where women come from and to which they will return. <b>Gender-Responsive</b> Evaluation is sensitive to cultural differences and expectations. The very first challenge is to use theories and research development that support the implementation of these critical programs.|$|E

It was the country's main vehicle for implementing the 1995 Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (BPfA) adopted at the 1995 UN Fourth World Conference on Women.|$|E
50|$|As some jurisdictions {{have begun}} {{implementing}} <b>gender-responsive</b> approaches in their juvenile justice system, {{it has been}} difficult to conduct the caliber of quantitative research necessary to establish an evidence base on the effectiveness of these approaches. This is due to the small number of girls within a given juvenile justice system who would be exposed to new programs or policies and the challenges this poses for statistically rigorous study designs. In one qualitative analysis by Hodge et al., county juvenile court staff were interviewed to determine if <b>gender-responsive</b> programming was meeting its intended goal. In these interviews staff reported substantial efforts to implement these approaches, as well as significant need to improve staff training and address gendered norms and stereotypes. Analysis of preliminary results of the evaluation the Project Kealahou program in Hawaii indicated that girls in the program demonstrated improvements across multiple outcomes. Researchers Suarez et al. suggested that these improvements {{may be due to the}} program's focus on intensive, peer-delivered supports within the community, and highlighted the relatively low cost of providing these services.|$|E

50|$|A 2012 {{study was}} {{conducted}} to understand the experiences of a new cognitive skills program that compares and contrasts a <b>gender-responsive</b> approach with a gender-neutral approach. The study involved a focus group of males and females that measured cognitive skills such as impulsivity, decision-making, interpersonal problem-solving, and influence in others. It concluded that participants were most receptive to gender-specific programs and evaluated the quality of current intervention and rehabilitation programs and whether they catered to their needs.|$|E
50|$|The United Nations has {{identified}} six avenues by which female participation {{in politics and}} government may be strengthened. These avenues are: equalization of educational opportunities, quotas for female participation in governing bodies, legislative reform to increase focus on issues concerning women and children, financing <b>gender-responsive</b> budgets to equally {{take into account the}} needs of men and women, increasing the presence of sex-disaggregated statistics in national research/data, and furthering the presence and agency of grassroots women's empowerment movements.|$|E
50|$|In {{discussing}} {{the relation between}} <b>gender-responsive</b> prisons and individuals who identify as gender non-conforming or transgender, research has been presented in bringing forth injustices within the prison setting. Research introduced has presented the term gender outlaws, a term in reference to individuals who do not committ to gender specific action. In the fight for Queer & Trans Politics, the Sylvia Rivera Law Project works with people regardless of their racial and gender background in ensuring a discrimination-free environment.|$|E
5000|$|A gender {{approach}} means ensuring that climate actions are <b>gender-responsive</b> and promote women’s participation in decision-making. While {{women make up}} approximately 50% of the world population, in many countries women are less {{able to cope with}} - and are more exposed to - the adverse effects of climate change because they have lesser economic, political and legal clout. Therefore, supporting women’s empowerment and drawing on their experiences, knowledge and skills will make climate change responses more effective.|$|E
5000|$|Gender {{budgeting}} encompasses {{activities and}} initiatives aiming at {{the preparation of}} budgets or the analysis of policies and budgets from a gender perspective.

It is rather concerned with addressing budgetary gender inequality concerns, as for instance, how gender hierarchies influence budgets, and gender-based unpaid or low paid work.|$|E
