50|$|The {{train was}} screw-coupled; each {{carriage}} was first coupled by a loose chain and <b>hook</b> <b>coupling</b> to the next; the slack on this was then {{taken up by}} a turnbuckle screw arrangement, until the buffers of the two carriages were touching. To uncouple, there needed to be some slack in the coupling; as the train had stopped all the couplings were under tension. Once the vacuum brake connection to the rear portion was broken, any attempt to introduce slack into the coupling between the two portions would be defeated by the rear portion settling back to rest its weight upon the rear van brakes. To assist uncoupling the front van guard therefore scotched one of {{the wheels of the}} sixth vehicle, that is, the front vehicle of the rear portion being detached. Loosening the turnbuckle thus transferred the weight of the rear portion to the scotch on the sixth vehicle, rather than to the rear van brakes. The couplings {{to the rear of the}} sixth vehicle remained under tension, and the slack introduced remained in the coupling between the fifth and sixth vehicles, which could be unhooked.|$|E

50|$|The {{chain brake}} was {{operated}} by a 5/8 in link chain, which was carried on sheaves underneath the train along the centre, connected by <b>coupling</b> <b>hooks</b> between carriages or trucks. Under each vehicle, the chain hanged slack while not in use. It passed under two pulleys which were attached to pulling-rods to operate the wooden brake blocks. To operate the brakes, the chain could be tightened from {{either end of the}} train. The guard's van could be used to retard a train on down grades, or to stop the entire train. In the event of a broken or disconnected chain, however, the brake system was useless. By c. 1876, a simple vacuum brake system was introduced as a reserve brake.|$|R
25|$|In British 00 scale (similar to H0 scale) models the 'tension lock' coupler {{developed}} by Tri-ang is standard. This {{is similar in}} operation to the meatchopper type of coupling.

Locomotives had a moulded coupling 'eye' at each end, while rolling stock had one 'hook' coupling and one 'eye' coupling {{on the other}} end. In 2002, the vehicles were updated to use U-hook couplings, with less 'give', but they were more prone to breakage. The majority of locomotive models and some road vehicles had a diecast metal body with a moulded plastic chassis and plastic wheels. The bodies were fully painted and lined. They were free-wheeling although the chassis was rigid (locomotives were not fitted with separate bogies), and a steam locomotive's tender {{was part of the}} same moulding as its body. Models of coaches and trucks were assembled from self-coloured plastic mouldings, with some surface detail (such as coach sides) being applied using self-adhesive labels.|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} fluid motion-vehicle {{dynamics}} interaction, {{a model of}} four, liquid filled two-axle container freight wagons was set up. The railway vehicle has been modelled as a multi-body system (MBS). To include fluid sloshing, an equivalent mechanical model has been developed and incorporated. The influence of several factors has been studied in computer simulations, such as track defects, curve negotiation, train velocity, wheel wear, liquid and solid wagonload, and container baffles. SIMPACK {{has been used for}} MBS analysis, and ANSYS for liquid sloshing modelling and equivalent mechanical systems validation. Acceleration and braking manoeuvres of the freight train set the liquid cargo into motion. This longitudinal sloshing motion of the fluid cargo inside the tanks initiated a swinging motion of some components of the coupling gear. The coupling gear consists of UIC standard traction <b>hooks</b> and <b>coupling</b> screws that are located between buffers. One of the coupling screws is placed in the traction hook of the opposite wagon thus joining the two wagons, whereas the unused coupling screw rests on a hanger. Simulation results showed that, for certain combinations of type of liquid, filling level and container dimensions, the liquid cargo could provoke an undesirable, although not hazardous, release of the unused coupling screw from its hanger. The coupling screw's release was especially obtained when a period of acceleration was followed by an abrupt braking manoeuvre at 1 m/s 2. It was shown that a resonance effect between the liquid's oscillation and the coupling screw's rotary motion could be the reason for the coupling screw's undesired release. Possible solutions to avoid the phenomenon are given. Acceleration and braking manoeuvres of the freight train set the liquid cargo into motion. This longitudinal sloshing motion of the fluid cargo inside the tanks initiated a swinging motion of some components of the coupling gear.

40|$|In Salmonella, the rod {{substructure}} of the flagellum is a periplasmic driveshaft {{that couples}} the torque {{generated by the}} basal body motor to the extracellular hook and filament. The rod subunits self-assemble, spanning the periplasmic space and stopping at the outer membrane when amature length of 22 nm is reached. Assembly of the extracellular hook and filament follow rod completion. Hook initiation requires that a pore forms in the outer membrane and that the rod-capping protein, FlgJ, dislodges {{from the tip of}} the distal rod and is replaced with the hook-capping protein, FlgD. Approximately 26 FlgH subunits form the L-ring around the distal rod that creates the pore through which the growing flagellumwill elongate from the cell body. The function of the L-ring in the mature flagellum is also thought to act as a bushing for the rotating rod. Work presented here dem-onstrates that, in addition to outer membrane pore formation, L-ring formation catalyzes the removal of the FlgJ rod cap. Rod cap removal allows the hook cap to assemble at the rod tip and results in the transition from rod completion in the periplasm to extracellular <b>hook</b> polymerization. By <b>coupling</b> the rod-to-hook switch to outer membrane penetration, FlgH ensures that hook and filament polymerization is initiated at the appropriate spatial and temporal point in flagellar biosynthesis. The bacterial flagellum exemplifies nanoscale engineering thatmicrobes have been perfecting over billions of years (1). This supramolecular structure is composed of approximately 25 dis-tinct protein subunits and self-assembles to final lengths of up to 20 m, several times the length of the cell itself (2).

2500|$|The MCC tour of Australia in 1962–63 was {{the first}} since they had lost 4–0 in 1958–59 just before Barrington became an England regular. Led by Ted Dexter and managed by Bernard Marmaduke Fitzalan-Howard, 16th Duke of Norfolk, they were to face the shrewd Australian captain Richie Benaud in the 1962-63 Ashes series and few thought they would win. Barrington made 104 against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval (a ground where he never failed to make 50 runs in the 10 innings he played there), 219 not out against an Australian XI as the MCC made 633/7, the highest score by the MCC or England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, and 183 not out against Queensland at the Gabba. He did little {{in the first three}} Tests, making 78 in the first innings at First Test at Brisbane, where he hit 6 fours in 20 minutes off the leg-spin of Richie Benaud and Bobby Simpson, but then took another 210 minutes to make 40 more runs. England won the Second Test at Melbourne and Australia the Third Test at Sydney and it was in the Fourth Test at Adelaide that he came into his own. He made 63 in the first innings and came in at 2/1 – soon 4/2 – in the second chasing 356 ro win. Barrington looked {{completely}} assured and began sweeping the Australian spin bowlers as Benaud, Simpson and Norm O'Neill all tried their arm. He reached his ton with a pull for six off Simpson over long-on, his seventh Test century and his first against Australia. With Alan Davidson injured Benaud gave the new ball to Bill Lawry who nearly knocked his cap off with a beamer that went for 4 byes. Barrington finished with 2 sixes and 16 fours in his 132 not out and he and Graveney (36 not out) played out the day with an unbeaten partnership of 101 to make England safe at 223/4. In the deciding Fifth Test at Sydney England started with a 9-hour 321 with Barrington entrenched at one end. The famous Sydney Hill become restless, with Barrington raising his cap when he was jeered and a slow hand clap started around the ground. Barrington usually woke up when his century was in sight, and a sweep of Simpson was dropped by Brian Booth, but a drive found its way to the boundary and a single brought up his hundred and a surprisingly generous round of applause from the stadium. He then drove Benaud straight to Neil Harvey in the covers, out for 101 after 320 minutes. In the second innings Dexter was determined to declare so he could dismiss the Australians and regain the Ashes, but Barrington made a sluggish 94 and [...] "just missed his second century of the match, and in that he was unlucky, but his innings had been marred because on this last day he had added only 37 runs in 107 minutes. He had batted in all for 263 minutes, and his 94 runs included only two fours; but Benaud's defensive field-placing had contributed to that". The match was drawn, but Barrington made 582 runs (72.75), more runs at a higher average than any other batsman on either side, and the most by an English batsman in Australia since Wally Hammond made 905 runs (113.12) in 1928–29. Travelling on to New Zealand the opposition was less fierce (New Zealand would not defeat England in a Test match until 1978). In the First Test at Auckland he made 126 and when the leg-side crowd barracked him he <b>hooked</b> a <b>couple</b> of fours to their boundary, then a six to the off-side when the crowd there shouted [...] "What about us?" [...] In all he hit 15 fours and a six as England made 562/7 and won by an innings. He made 76 in the Second Test to give him six consecutive 50s in Test cricket (63, 132 not out, 101, 94, 126 and 76), an England record he shares with Patsy Hendren, Ted Dexter and Alastair Cook. Barrington made 47 and 45 as a makeshift opener in the Third Test and made 294 runs (73.50) as England won the series 3–0. His 1,763 first-class runs (80.13) was only 18 short of Denis Compton's record for an MCC tour.|$|R
