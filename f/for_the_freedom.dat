5|$|Sauerbrunn {{returned}} to the Freedom for the 2010 WPS season. She played in all 24 games {{of the regular season}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Freedom.</b> At the end of the regular season, the Freedom ranked fourth in the league and advanced to the playoffs. The Freedom faced the Philadelphia Independence {{in the first round of}} the playoffs on September 19. Sauerbrunn started the match and played all 120 minutes, which ended in a 1–0 defeat <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Freedom.</b>|$|E
5|$|African-American {{protests in}} the South {{accelerated}} {{in the early}} 1960s, and the ACLU assisted at every step. After four African-American college students staged a sit-in in a segregated North Carolina department store, the sit-in movement gained momentum across the United States. During 1960-61, the ACLU defended black students arrested for demonstrating in North Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana. The ACLU also provided legal help <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Freedom</b> Rides in 1961, {{the integration of the}} University of Mississippi, the Birmingham campaign in 1963, and the 1964 Freedom Summer.|$|E
5|$|Control over {{propaganda}} {{is another}} matter. When forming his argument here, Russell specifically targets the doctrines of John Stuart Mill. Russell argues that Mill's argument <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>freedom</b> of speech is too weak, {{so long as}} it is balanced against the harm principle; for any speech worth protecting for political reasons is likely to cause somebody harm. For example, the citizen ought {{to have the opportunity to}} impeach malicious governors, but that would surely harm the governor, at the very least (Russell 1938:179).|$|E

5|$|In {{the sixteenth}} and seventeenth centuries, {{the status of}} women amongst masons in Britain is likely to be similar to that codified in the minutes of the lodge at St. Mary's Chapel in Edinburgh. A burgess could pay <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Freedom</b> to employ and {{instruct}} masons. The widow of a master mason could accept commissions from his old clients, provided that she employed a journeyman of the lodge to supervise the work.|$|E
5|$|Raised by Mormon {{parents and}} devout to the faith, Dalton was a feminist; as a child, she felt jealous of boys <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>freedom</b> and {{privileges}} they enjoyed {{and felt that}} girls were neglected by the education system. She became a women's rights activist, believing that women {{should have the right}} to suffrage, education, property, control over their money, and custody of their children. As a teacher, she advocated for equal educational and recreational opportunities for girls.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Dalton felt {{jealous of}} boys <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>freedom</b> they enjoyed. They could travel alone without {{worrying}} about their reputation and were often bribed to attend school, while girls were, in her opinion, educated reluctantly. One of her teachers {{thought it would be}} wasteful for her to study algebra, as she already had sufficient education for a housewife. As a young woman, she felt that women lived on a higher moral level than men. She saw polygamy as a way to allow more women to marry the few good men, arguing that it gave more women the opportunity to marry. She also considered it ironic that prostitution was tolerated but polygamy was considered depraved.|$|E

You, who want <b>freedom,</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>for</b> everything, <b>the</b> <b>freedom</b> of parties, you who want all <b>the</b> <b>freedoms,</b> you intellectuals: freedom that will corrupt our youth, freedom that will pave <b>the</b> way <b>for</b> <b>the</b> oppressor, <b>freedom</b> that will drag our nation to the bottom.|$|R

50|$|The 2009 WPS Draft {{took place}} on January 16, 2009. <b>The</b> <b>Freedom</b> drafted Allie Long, Alex Singer, Jill Gilbeau, Parrissa Eyorokon, Briana Scurry, Rebecca Moros, Sarah Senty, Kati Jo Spisak, Claire Zimmeck, and Christen Karniski.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Nine Inch Nails was {{involved}} in a much-publicized feud with TVT Records, the first record label to sign the band. Reznor objected to the label's attempted interference with his intellectual property. Ultimately, they entered into a joint venture with Interscope Records in which Reznor forfeited a portion of his publishing rights to TVT Music in exchange <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>freedom</b> of having his own Nothing Records imprint. In 2005, Reznor sued his former friend and manager John Malm, co-founder of Nothing, for fraud, breach of contract and fiduciary duty, and other claims. Their relationship was formally severed in a New York courtroom, with damages awarded to Reznor in excess of $3 million.|$|E
5|$|That night, {{many of the}} revolutionaries {{attended}} a theatre production {{on the theme of}} tyranny, called Rome Saved. The lead actor was Morante, playing Cicero. The police chief requested Morante to feign illness and not appear, so that the play could be replaced with Misanthropy and Repentance by the German novelist and playwright August von Kotzebue. Rumors of police censorship spread quickly; Morante ignored the request and performed the play as planned. In the fourth act, Morante made a patriotic speech, about the Gaul threat to Rome (the Gauls are ancestors of the French people) and the need for strong leadership to resist the danger. This scene lifted the revolutionaries' spirits and led to frenzied applause. Juan José Paso stood up and cried out <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>freedom</b> of Buenos Aires, and a small fight ensued.|$|E
5|$|The Washington Freedom {{joined the}} newly formed Women's Professional Soccer league for the 2009 season. On October 6, 2008, Sauerbrunn was picked third overall {{in the first round}} of the 2008 WPS General Draft, which {{assigned}} the WPS rights of international and domestic players to the teams in the WPS for the 2009 season. Sauerbrunn made her first appearance for the team on March 29, 2009 in a match against the Los Angeles Sol. She started all 20 games <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Freedom</b> in the regular season and in the team's one playoff match. She made one goal during the season in the 54th minute of the match against the Chicago Red Stars on April 11.|$|E
25|$|In the WTT Finals, the Racquets met <b>the</b> Philadelphia <b>Freedoms</b> who had <b>the</b> league's best regular-season {{record and}} {{were led by}} their player=coach and WTT Most Valuable Player Billie Jean King. The Racquets swept the best-of-three series, 27–21 at home and 28–24 in front of 5,134 fans in Philadelphia, to win the championship. In the second match, Andrew Pattison's 6–0 set win in men's singles proved too much <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Freedoms</b> to {{overcome}} despite winning {{three of the five}} sets in the match. Buster Mottram started that set <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Freedoms</b> against Pattison. King sent Brian Fairlie in as a substitute after Mottram fell behind, 3–0, and managed only three points in those three games. Fairlie didn't fare better, not getting any points in his first two games.|$|R

5|$|On June 2, 2010, Harris {{signed with}} the Washington Freedom {{following}} the dissolution of Saint Louis Athletica. After signing with the Freedom, Harris stated that her contributions to the team would not be through starting and playing, as Erin McLeod was the starting goalkeeper for the team at the time. On July 24, McLeod suffered an ACL tear during a match against FC Gold Pride. Brianna Scurry, the back-up <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Freedom,</b> had suffered a concussion {{earlier in the year}} and was also out for the season. Harris was left as the starting goalkeeper and made her first appearance for the team on July 28, 2010, where she started in a match against Atlanta Beat. She appeared in the seven remaining games of the regular season and earned the Freedom a spot in the playoffs. The Freedom took on the Philadelphia Independence {{in the first round of}} the playoffs on September 19. Harris made three saves in regular time and the match was scoreless after 90 minutes. In the 120th minute, Amy Rodriguez scored for Philadelphia, resulting in a 1–0 victory and the Freedom's elimination from the playoffs.|$|E
