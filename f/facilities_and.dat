40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the relationship between the administrative district and the zoning of the <b>facility</b> <b>and</b> service areas. First of all we divide the administrative district into seven types, then we make it clear how many correspondences between the administrative district <b>and</b> 34 <b>facility</b> <b>and</b> service areas by comparing each other. And after making it clear, we take notice of the historical transition of the administrative district, analyze how the administrative district is concerned with the <b>facility</b> <b>and</b> service areas. As a result, we can see that the administrative district (divided into seven types in this study, particularly, city-county area) corresponds with a lot of <b>facility</b> <b>and</b> service areas. That is, we could understand that the administrative district is concerned with the <b>facility</b> <b>and</b> service areas so much, one of the reason for that is the influence of historical transition on the administrative district(including the type of the region crossing the city-county area). After this, it is necessary we analyze the zoning of the <b>facility</b> <b>and</b> service areas with a present view as well as an overall historical view...|$|R
5|$|The main map (the upper {{two thirds}} of the screen) is divided into squares, on which players can {{establish}} bases, move units and engage in combat. Through terraforming, players may modify the effects of the individual map squares on movement, combat and resources. Resources are used to feed the population, construct units and <b>facilities,</b> <b>and</b> supply energy. Players can allocate energy between research into new technology and energy reserves. Unlike Civilization II, new technology grants access to additional unit components rather than pre-designed units, allowing players to design and re-design units as their factions' priorities shift. Energy reserves allow the player to upgrade units, maintain <b>facilities,</b> <b>and</b> attempt to win by the Global Energy Market scenario. Bases are military strongpoints and objectives that are vital for all winning strategies. They produce military units, house the population, collect energy, and build secret projects and Subspace Generators. <b>Facilities</b> <b>and</b> secret projects improve the performance of individual bases and of the entire faction.|$|E
