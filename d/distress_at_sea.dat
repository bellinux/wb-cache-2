This painting may have been inspired by the frequently reproduced Dutch line engraving after Stradanus of 1590. The work, which depicts the defeat of the Turkish naval force by a European coalition in 1571, is undated but was likely painted around 1683, the year that the Turks unsuccessfully laid siege to Vienna. It is likely that the general relief after the retreat of the Turks before Vienna provided the impulse for this composition.

40|$|The {{safety of}} {{navigation}} through all past ages {{has been a}} primary preoccupation for all seamen and shipping owners. <b>Distress</b> and disasters <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> caused by the blind forces of Mother Nature or by human factors have occurred {{during the course of}} many centuries on ships and in the life of seafarers. For many centuries, seafarers sailed without incoming information about trip, navigation and weather conditions <b>at</b> <b>sea.</b> <b>At</b> that time, only audio and visual transfers of information from point to point were used. However, no earlier than the end of the 19 th century, were developed new disciplines, such as the transmission of news and information via wire initially, then by radio (wireless) and latterly, via modern satellite and stratospheric platform communications systems. The facts about airplanes and land vehicles are well determined and clear because these transport mediums have more reliable environments and routes than ships. After a disaster with airplane, train, truck or bus {{it is much easier to}} find out their positions and to provide alert, search and assistance.

On the basis of just world theory, the authors argue that strong student BJW should be associated with low school distress. Two questionnaire studies with German secondary school students attending grades 7 to 13 are reported. Both studies found strong BJW to be associated with less <b>distress</b> <b>at</b> school, better grades, and the evaluation of grades and teachers as more just. Moreover, {{the relationship between}} strong BJW and low school distress persisted when controlled for grades, justice of grades, and teacher justice. This relationship held for all students, independently of their school track, grade level, or gender. Overall, the pattern of results reveals school distress to have a unique association with BJW and school-specific justice cognitions.

50|$|The Galdrabók (Icelandic Book of Magic) is an Icelandic grimoire {{dated to}} ca. 1600. It {{is a small}} {{manuscript}} containing a collection of 47 spells and sigils/staves. The grimoire was compiled by four different people, possibly starting in the late 16th century and going on until the mid-17th century. The first three scribes were Icelanders, and the fourth was a Dane working from Icelandic material. The various spells consist of Latin and runic material as well as Icelandic magical staves, invocations to Christian entities, demons and the Norse gods, as well as instructions {{for the use of}} herbs and magical items. Some of the spells are protective, intended against such problems as trouble with childbearing, headache and insomnia, previous incantations, pestilence, suffering and <b>distress</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea.</b> Others are intended to cause fear, kill animals, find thieves, put someone to sleep, cause flatulence, or bewitch women.|$|E
50|$|During {{the first}} two years of war, the British had no coordinated air-sea rescue units—only about 28 crash boats and no {{dedicated}} aircraft. The ditching of a British aeroplane in the Channel or the North Sea usually doomed its crew. The fate of downed airmen was primarily in the hands of their parent organization, and they had little they could do to help the crash boats locate the accident site. In January 1941, a Directorate of Air-Sea Rescue was formed by the Royal Air Force for the purpose of saving those in <b>distress</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea,</b> especially airmen. Proper provisioning of rescue squadrons was slow, and it took more than a year for sea-going rescue boats and aircraft to come together in active ASR squadrons. Between February and August 1941, of the 1,200 British airmen that landed in the Channel or the North Sea, 444 were rescued, with 78 more picked up and interned by the Seenotdienst. The organization copied much from the successful efforts of the Seenotdienst. British air-sea rescue units began in September 1942 to work with the United States Army Air Forces to coordinate rescue activities over the Channel and the North Sea. Observers from the U.S. took cues from both the Seenotdienst and the British rescue operations. The combined US-UK effort led to the saving of some 2,000 American fliers from the seas around the UK. From the time of its inception to the end of the war, the British effort alone rescued 13,629 people from the ocean, 8,000 of which were airmen.|$|E
5000|$|Kierkegaard {{was raised}} by parents who were at {{opposite}} poles of the spectrum of faith. His father read philosophy and studied {{with the leaders of}} the Church of Denmark while his mother couldn't even read. He had learned the terror of belief at an early age. He stood far {{to the right of the}} two extremes of the consciousness of sin, those who believe that they sin because Adam sins so there is no use trying to stop sinning and those who believe that every sin is like crucifying Christ and possibly commit suicide because they despise themselves so much. One is in danger of being too light-minded about sin and the other is in danger of being halted or stopped at every moment in fear and trembling. His father taught him the terror of Christianity but his mother showed him the lighter side of the faith. He sought his own balance between the two and he thought his contribution to the discussion about beauty, truth and faith was worth reading. This is how he explained it to himself in Two Upbuilding Discourses, 1843, and in his Journals (1849). He died not knowing if he had achieved anything at all but he still had faith.If you had loved people then the earnestness of life might have taught you not to be strident but to become silent, and when you were in <b>distress</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> and did not see land, then at least not to involve others in it; it might have taught you to smile at least as long as you believed anyone sought in your face an explanation, a witness. We do not judge you for doubting, because doubt is a crafty passion, and it can certainly be difficult to tear oneself out of its snares. What we require of the doubter that he be silent. What doubt did not make him happy-why then confide to others what will make them just as unhappy. Doubt is a deep and crafty passion. But he whose soul is not gripped by it so inwardly that he becomes speechless is only shamming this passion, therefore what he says is not only false in itself but above all on his lips. The expectancy of faith, then, is victory. The doubt that comes from the outside does not disturb it, since it disgraces itself by speaking. Yet doubt is guileful, on secret paths it sneaks around a person, and when faith is expecting victory, doubt whispers that this expectancy is a deception. An expectancy that without a specified time and place is nothing but a deception; In that way one may always go on waiting; such an expectancy is a circle into which the soul is bewitched and from which it does not escape. In the expectancy of faith, the soul is indeed prevented from falling out of itself, as it were, into multiplicity; it remains in itself, but it would be the worst evil that could befall a person if it escaped from this cycle. *Søren Kierkegaard, Two Upbuilding Discourses, May 16, 1843When I began as an author of Either/Or, I no doubt had a far more profound impression of the terror of Christianity than any clergyman in the country. I had a fear and trembling such as perhaps no one else had. Not that I therefore wanted to relinquish Christianity. No, I had another interpretation of it. For one thing I had in fact learned very early that there are men who seem to be selected for suffering, and, for another thing, I was conscious of having sinned much and therefore supposed that Christianity had to appear to me in the form of this terror. But how cruel and false of you, I thought, if you use it to terrify others, perhaps upset every so many happy, loving lives that may very well be truly Christian. It was as alien as it could possibly be to my nature to want to terrify others, and therefore I both sadly and perhaps also a bit proudly found my joy in comforting others and in being gentleness itself to them-hiding the terror in my own interior being. So my idea was to give my contemporaries (whether or not they themselves would want to understand) a hint in humorous form (in order to achieve a lighter tone) that a much greater pressure was needed-but then no more; I aimed to keep my heavy burden to myself, as my cross. I have often taken exception to anyone who was a sinner in the strictest sense and then promptly got busy terrifying others. Here is where Concluding Postscript comes in. … *Søren Kierkegaard, Journal and Papers, VI 6444 (Pap. X1 A541) (1849) (Either/Or Part II, Hong p. 451-452) ...|$|E

40|$|International law requires that {{everyone}} rescued at sea shall be disembarked and delivered to a ‘place of safety’. However, neither the treaties that establish this requirement {{nor any other}} treaty define {{what is meant by}} ‘place of safety’. When refugees and migrants are rescued at sea considerations of international human rights law and international refugee law as well as of international law against transnational organized crime are of principal concern. This article examines the concept of 'place of safety' and argues that it needs to be interpreted in the wider context of international law, so that other relevant and applicable rules of international law are taken into account. The article provides an exploratory discussion of the interpretation of the concept of 'place of safety', seen particularly against the background that many of those rescued at sea are refugees and migrants. The article also comprises discussions of the duty to rescue those in <b>distress</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea,</b> the basic rules on interpretation of treaties and the legal framework for rescue of migrants at sea.

50|$|The use {{of radio}} {{to aid in}} rescuing {{survivors}} of accidents <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> came to the forefront after {{the sinking of the}} RMS Titanic in 1912.

This frequency had the advantage of long range due to ground-wave propagation and was constantly monitored by all large ships <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> after the Titanics sinking. However, due to its wavelength of 600 meters, a long antenna was required to achieve good range. Long wires on the order of 1/4 wavelength held up by kites or balloons were often used.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{present study}} aimed to assess {{predictors}} of distress after 'prophylactic mastectomy (PM) and salpingo-ovariectomy (PSO), {{in order to}} enable the early identification of patients who could benefit from psychological support. PATIENTS AND METHODS: General distress and cancer-related distress were assessed in 82 women at increased risk of hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer undergoing PM and/or PSO, before and 6 and 12 months after prophylactic surgery. Neurotic lability and coping were assessed before surgery. RESULTS: Cancer-related distress and general <b>distress</b> <b>at</b> both follow-up moments were best explained by the level of cancer-related and general <b>distress</b> <b>at</b> baseline. Being a mutation carrier was predictive of increased cancer-related <b>distress</b> <b>at</b> 6 -month follow-up (but not at 12 months), and of lower general distress 12 months after prophylactic surgery. Also, coping by having comforting thoughts was predictive of less cancer-related <b>distress</b> <b>at</b> 6 -month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Genetically predisposed women {{who are at risk}} of post-surgical distress can be identified using {{one or more of the}} predictors found in this study. Exploration of and/or attention to cancer-related distress and coping style before prophylactic surgery may help physicians and psychosocial workers to identify women who might benefit from additional post-surgical support...|$|R
