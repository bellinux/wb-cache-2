5|$|Eastern Africa {{represents}} some of {{the most}} reliable dates, due to the use of radiocarbon dating on volcanic ash deposits, as well as {{some of the}} earliest MSA sites. Faunal preservation, however, is not spectacular, and standardization <b>in</b> <b>site</b> excavation and lithic classification was, until recently, lacking. Unlike northern Africa, shifts between lithic technologies were not nearly as pronounced, likely due to more favorable climatic conditions that would have allowed for more continuous occupation of sites. Central Africa reflects similar patterning to eastern Africa, yet more archaeological research of the region is certainly required.|$|E
5|$|From {{the same}} site where T.goodmani was found, Samonds also {{recorded}} the distal (far) end of a Triaenops humerus (upper arm bone), with a width of 3.58mm. This bone was similar to humeri of T.menamena, {{but she did not}} identify it as either species because of the small size difference between T.menamena and T.goodmani. <b>In</b> <b>site</b> NCC-1 (estimated 69,600 to 86,800 years old), two Triaenops mandibles were recorded, one with p4 and m1 and another with m1–2 and part of m3. Relative to living Triaenops and Paratriaenops, m1 in those jaws is longer and narrower. Although sample sizes are small, the measurements do not resemble those of T.goodmani. In addition, the ridge between the entoconid and metaconid is stronger than in T.goodmani. Samonds identified these jaws only as Triaenops.|$|E

30|$|Regarding {{economic}} status, household {{assets were}} fewer in rural Mexico than <b>in</b> other <b>sites.</b> Home ownership was almost universal, {{other than in}} urban China, where just over half of homes were owned. <b>In</b> Chinese <b>sites,</b> particularly <b>in</b> urban China, household savings were much more commonly reported and debts less so than <b>in</b> <b>sites</b> <b>in</b> Peru and Mexico. Negative perceptions of household economic circumstances and indicators of economic strain were also less commonly reported in the urban and rural China <b>sites</b> than <b>in</b> <b>sites</b> <b>in</b> other countries. Catastrophic healthcare spending was more common in Mexico and in urban China, than <b>in</b> other <b>sites.</b>|$|R
5|$|Workshops, {{later to}} be known as the East Workshops, were built to {{rehabilitate}} prisoners, and aid <b>in</b> <b>site</b> construction. A blacksmith's shop was constructed in 1852, and a carpenters’ shop was added in 1858. The prison was designed to have other services onsite, including a kitchen, with four boilers, scullery, pantry, cool room and stores; a bakehouse and ovens, with separate stores for flour and bread; as well as a washhouse, laundry and drying room. The building holding these services was completed in 1855. A separate building, a hospital providing medical services, was also planned, but was one of the last to be constructed. The foundations were laid in 1857, but the plans were changed the next year to provide additional space to isolate contagious or dangerous patients. The hospital was finished in 1859.|$|E
5|$|One {{factor that}} reduces the chances of re-discovering the white-eyed martin is the drastic decline {{in the numbers of}} {{swallows}} wintering at Bueng Boraphet, its only known site, from the hundreds of thousands reported around 1970 to maximum counts of 8,000 made in the winter of 1980–1981. It is not certain whether this represents a real decline or a shift <b>in</b> <b>site</b> in response to persecution. Other potential causes for the species' decline include the disturbance of riverine sand bars, the construction of dams which flood the area upstream and alter the downstream hydrology, deforestation, and increasing conversion of its habitat to agriculture. Very few swallows now roost in the Bueng Boraphet reedbeds, preferring sugarcane plantations, and, despite searching, the white-eyed river martin has not been found in other nearby large swallow roosts. Bueng Boraphet has been declared a non-hunting area in an effort to protect the species, but surveys to find this martin have been unsuccessful. Past surveys include several at Bueng Boraphet, a 1969 survey of the Nan Yom and Wang Rivers of northern Thailand, and a 1996 survey of rivers in northern Laos. A possible unverified sighting was reported in 2004.|$|E

40|$|The {{populations of}} Japanese bitterlings and unionid mussels {{and the land}} use of the {{watershed}} were investigated <b>in</b> 36 sampling <b>sites</b> <b>in</b> the Tatara river system in northern Kyushu, Japan.

The population of the bitterlings decreased <b>in</b> the <b>sites</b> with a high urbanization rate, although the populations of several other fish species showed no dependence on the urbanization rate. The population of the mussels showed a negative correlation with urbanization rate. In addition, the mussels populations showed positive relationship with the bitterling populations. These three relationships indicate that the decrease in the bitterling population due to the urbanization of the watershed was responsible for the decrease in the mussel population...|$|R
