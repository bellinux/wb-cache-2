40|$|We {{describe}} three male {{individuals from}} a consanguineous south Indian family affected with the multiple pterygium syndrome (Escobar syndrome). Common clinical features included short stature, multiple pterygium, skeletal anomalies, and normal intelligence. The first report of this condition {{was made in}} 1902 from this same place (Pondicherry) and the disease received its present popular name Escobar syndrome in 1982.

Researchers have also studied the zebrafish to gain new insights into the complexities of human musculoskeletal diseases, such as muscular dystrophy. Another focus of zebrafish research is to understand how a gene called Hedgehog, a biological signal that underlies a number of human cancers, controls cell growth.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Congenital heart {{diseases}} (CHD) {{are commonly}} associated with <b>genetic</b> <b>defects.</b> Our study aimed at determining the occurrence and pattern of CHD association with <b>genetic</b> <b>defects</b> among pediatric patients in Rwanda. Methods: A total of 125 patients with clinical features suggestive of <b>genetic</b> <b>defects</b> were recruited. Echocardiography and standard karyotype studies were performed in all patients. Results: CHDs were detected {{in the majority of}} patients with <b>genetic</b> <b>defects.</b> The commonest isolated CHD was ventricular septal defect found in many cases of Down syndrome. In total, chromosomal abnormalities represented the majority of cases in our cohort and were associated with various types o...|$|R
40|$|Repair {{of damage}} to the DNA is {{essential}} for the maintenance of genomic stability, both during embryonic development and normal growth. The cell has therefore evolved a complex array of interconnected pathways to ensure the appropriate response to DNA damage is initiated, such as cell cycle checkpoint arrest, activation of DNA repair pathways or induction of apoptotic processes. These co-ordinated signal transduction pathways have been termed the DNA damage response (DDR). A previous study showed that ATR-dependent damage responses were frequently defective in cell lines from patients with Microcephalic Primordial Dwarfism (MPD) disorders. In this thesis I have further characterised ATR–dependent damage response signalling in several cell lines from patients with various MPD disorders. I have shown that novel mutations in PCNT, which encodes a structural centrosomal protein, result in an MPD disorder and have characterised the associated ATRdependent DNA damage responses. I also contributed to the identification of mutations in ORC 1, encoding a component of the DNA replication Origin Recognition Complex, in further MPD patients and examined origin licensing and Sphase progression in the patient derived cell lines. As a novel finding, I observed defects in the ATR-dependent G 2 /M checkpoint response in these cells. Additionally, I have characterised novel mutations in ATRIP, a gene encoding the obligate partner of ATR, in Seckel Syndrome patients, denoting a novel <b>genetic</b> <b>defect</b> in this <b>condition.</b> Finally, I have explored the role of PLK 1 and AurA kinase in ATRdependent G 2 /M checkpoint control and provided compelling evidence of misregulation of this pathway in various MPD-patient derived cell lines. Collectively these data provide important functional insights into the <b>genetic</b> <b>defects</b> that cause MPD disorders and further explore the link between defective ATR-dependent damage response signalling and microcephaly...|$|R

40|$|Primary cardiac arrhythmias {{are often}} caused by defects, {{predominantly}} {{in the genes}} responsible for generation of cardiac electrical potential i. e. cardiac rhythm generation. Due to the variability in underlying <b>genetic</b> <b>defects,</b> type and location of the mutations and putative modifiers, clinical phenotypes could be moderate to severe, even absent in many individuals. Clinical presentation and severity could be quite variable, syncope or sudden cardiac death (SCD) could also be {{the first and the}} only manifestation in a patient who had previously no symptoms at all. Despite usual familial occurrence of such cardiac arrhythmias, disease causal <b>genetic</b> <b>defects</b> could also be de novo in significant number of patients. Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is the most eloquently investigated primary cardiac rhythm disorder.
