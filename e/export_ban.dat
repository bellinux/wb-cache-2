5|$|In the 1950s {{the breed}} enjoyed much success because the beef market demanded low input (feed) cattle with high quality meat. However, the BSE crisis (commonly {{referred}} to as mad cow disease) caused an <b>export</b> <b>ban</b> in 1990, although there were no cases of BSE found in Galloway cattle. This created a fear associated with cattle, so breed numbers declined.|$|E
5|$|Exportation of merinos without royal {{permission}} {{was also}} a punishable offense, thus ensuring a near-absolute monopoly on the breed until the mid-18th century. After {{the breaking of the}} <b>export</b> <b>ban,</b> fine wool sheep began to be distributed worldwide. The export to Rambouillet by Louis XVI in 1786 formed the basis for the modern Rambouillet (or French Merino) breed. After the Napoleonic Wars and the global distribution of the once-exclusive Spanish stocks of Merinos, sheep raising in Spain reverted to hardy coarse-wooled breeds such as the Churra, and was no longer of international economic significance.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the early}} 2000 s, the {{government}} of Malawi has used trade restrictions, <b>export</b> <b>bans</b> in particular, to control trade flows for maize and soya, among other crops. Maize <b>export</b> <b>bans,</b> justified {{in the name of}} national food security, have been in place more or less continuously since 2005, with the ban lifted temporarily in 2007 - 08 and 2009 - 11. <b>Export</b> <b>bans</b> on soya, used to benefit domestic vegetable oil processors and the poultry industry in the form of lower input prices, were imposed several times for a few months at a time between 2010 and 2012. In 2013, government scrapped soya <b>export</b> <b>bans</b> as a trade policy tool, but since 2015 has explored other measures to limit soya exports, including an export levy and a mandate that all soya exports be processed through a single trading company.

The Higgins Art Gallery & Museum, Bedford, holds a particularly fine collection, begun with a large number of purchases from the estate of Charles and Lavinia Handley-Read, including the Narcissus washstand, Burges's bed and the Crocker Dressing Table. The most recent acquisition by the Bedford Museum is the Zodiac settle (1869–70), painted by Henry Stacy Marks. The Museum paid £850,000 for the settle, comprising a £480,000 grant from the National Heritage Memorial Fund, £190,000 from the Trustees of the Cecil Higgins Art Gallery and £180,000 from the Art Fund after the British government imposed an <b>export</b> <b>ban</b> on the work.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The use {{of export}} {{restrictions}} has substantially increased in recent years. While {{a number of}} papers show how these restrictions have increased world commodity prices, in this paper, we empirically estimate how one country’s export restrictions affected the efficiency of their domestic market. We use a threshold cointegration model to estimate the integration between selected wheat and rice markets in India before and during the <b>export</b> <b>bans</b> and test whether those bans exacerbated the price effects of domestic production shocks. We find that before the ban, the majority of port markets for rice and wheat are integrated with the world market, while only one pair was afterward. We also find evidence that the ban reduced market integration between producing and consuming regions in India. Further, we find that the ban increased domestic price volatility resulting from domestic supply shocks. Thus, we show that <b>export</b> <b>bans</b> can have domestic costs by reducing domestic market efficiency and increasing domestic price volatility...|$|R

25|$|The {{food crisis}} in 2008, which saw the stocks empty {{out and the}} prices skyrocket, even {{introduced}} a popular demand for the introduction of emergency stocks of agricultural produce in the EU, which would help stabilise prices both on the very volatile markets. In 2010, the European Commission announced its intention to sell out of its cereal stocks to stabilise the situation after a Russian grain <b>export</b> <b>ban</b> had stung world markets, sending wheat prices to two-year highs and sparked worries of a crisis in global food supplies that could spark widespread strains and protests.|$|E
25|$|With the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, Japan started to restrict the export of bullion currency, which came {{to be seen as a}} loss for the country. An <b>export</b> <b>ban</b> on monetary specie was imposed by Arai Hakuseki in 1715. Trade substitution was encouraged, but remained limited anyway due to the policy of closure, or Sakoku. Upon Arai Hakuseki's suggestion the government increased again the gold and silver content of coinage in 1714-1715, but this led to crippling deflation this time. In 1736, Japan abandoned this policy and again increased the money supply, with a resulting price stability for the next 80 years.|$|E

25|$|Despite a U.S. ban on {{the export}} of helium under the Helium Control Act of 1927, the Germans {{designed}} the airship to use the far safer gas {{in the belief that}} they could convince the US government to license its export. When the designers learned that the National Munitions Control Board would refuse to lift the <b>export</b> <b>ban,</b> they were forced to re-engineer Hindenburg to use hydrogen for lift. Despite the danger of using flammable hydrogen, no alternative lighter-than-air gases could provide sufficient lift. One beneficial side effect of employing hydrogen was that more passenger cabins could be added. The Germans' long history of flying hydrogen-filled passenger airships without a single injury or fatality engendered a widely held belief they had mastered the safe use of hydrogen. Hindenburgs first season performance appeared to demonstrate this.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the passage}} of Gafilo, the Malagasy {{government}} passed Inter-ministerial Order 17939/2004 in September 2004, which {{cleared the way for}} export of new and existing stocks of rosewood as ‘salvage’.

During this time, Marojejy National Park reported that with the granting of export rights, logging in the park had resumed. It was not until 2006, with the passing of Inter-ministerial Order 16030/2006, that the <b>export</b> <b>ban</b> was reinstated, nearly two years after the storm, but not before the exporters lobbied the government for an extension ‘following the grievances expressed by operators’ in October 2005, per Memorandum 923/05.

500|$|A recent {{development}} in the coinage of Coenwulf came with the discovery in 2001 of a gold coin bearing the name Coenwulf at Biggleswade in Bedfordshire, England, on a footpath beside the River Ivel. The 4.33 g (0.15oz) mancus, worth about 30 silver pennies, is only the eighth known Anglo-Saxon gold coin dating to the mid-to-late Anglo-Saxon period. The coin's inscription, [...] "DE VICO LVNDONIAE", indicates that it was minted in London. Initially sold to American collector Allan Davisson for £230,000 at an auction held by Spink auction house in 2004, the British Government subsequently put in place an <b>export</b> <b>ban</b> {{in the hope of}} saving it for the British public.
