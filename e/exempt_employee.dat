40|$|Thesis (Ed. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2004 In 2001, a team {{developed}} and implemented a survey on staffing {{issues related to}} advisor and faculty counselor positions in the Washington State community and technical college system {{for the purpose of}} providing staffing data to inform education policy discussions. Chief student affairs officers from each of the 34 institutions assembled respondent teams to report the staffing trends for advisors and faculty counselor positions in five-year increments from 1985 / 86 to 2000 / 01. The data indicates that traditional faculty counselor duties are being reassigned to rapidly expanding advisor positions within non-faculty classified staff and administrative <b>exempt</b> <b>employee</b> classifications. Employees in these non-faculty employee classifications groups are paid less, have less job security, and have less educational training than faculty counselors. Data is reported and analyzed for policy and educational leadership implications. Recommendations for future research, policy, and leadership considerations for the staffing of counselors and advisors in the Washington State community and technical college system are also included...|$|E

In addition, there has been a lack of papers published since the 2004 inquiry despite heightened activity by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner; the exception being the recent review undertaken by the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) (2007). We argue that the Government's approach to the regulation of workplace privacy was inadequate. Consequently, it is appropriate to revisit this issue and remove the employee records exemption, replacing it with a more robust framework of protections...|$|R
50|$|According to the FLSA, unless <b>exempt,</b> <b>employees</b> are {{entitled}} to receive overtime pay calculated at least time and one-half times pay for all time worked past forty hours a week. Some exemptions to this rule apply to public service agencies or to employees who meet certain requirements in accordance to their job duties along with a salary of no less than $455 a week. Despite regulations, there are many employees today who are not paid overtime due them. A 2009 study of workers in the United States found that in 12 occupations {{more than half of}} surveyed workers reported being denied overtime pay: child care (90.2 percent denial), stock and office clerks (86 percent), home health care (82.7 percent), beauty/dry cleaning and general repair workers (81.9 percent), car wash workers and parking attendants (77.9 percent), waiters, cafeteria workers and bartenders (77.9 percent), retail salespersons (76.2 percent), janitors and grounds workers (71.2 percent), garment workers (69.9 percent), cooks and dishwashers (67.8 percent), construction workers (66.1 percent) and cashiers (58.8 percent).|$|R

5000|$|In the United States the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 {{applies to}} {{employees}} in industries engaged in or producing goods for interstate commerce. The FLSA establishes a standard work week of 40 hours for {{certain kinds of}} workers, and mandates payment for overtime hours to those workers of one and one-half times the workers' normal rate of pay for any time worked above 40 hours. The law creates two broad categories of employees, those who are [...] "exempt" [...] from the regulation {{and those who are}} [...] "non-exempt". Under the law, employers are not required to pay <b>exempt</b> <b>employees</b> overtime but must do so for non-exempt employees. Independent contractors are not considered employees and therefore are not protected by the FLSA. Several factors determine whether a worker is an employee, who might be entitled to overtime compensation, or an independent contractor, who would not be so entitled. The employment agreement stating that a party is an independent contractor does not make it necessarily so. The nature of a job determines whether an employee is entitled to overtime pay, not employment status or the field of work.|$|R

Data obtained from the respondents were analyzed by applying a 2 x 3 analysis of variance with the factors of age and sex considered to be fixed. An analysis made of the data obtained from the respondents determined no significant correlation of intrinsic satisfaction, extrinsic satisfaction, and general job satisfaction existed relative to respondent age. The data, however, did indicate a significant correlation between intrinsic satisfaction and general job satisfaction did exist relative to respondent sex. No correlation between extrinsic satisfaction relative to respondent age was found. The data further found both male and female groups described job security to be the source of highest satisfaction.

40|$|Previous {{researches}} on non-monetary rewards {{have explored}} {{ways in which}} psychological phenomena can enhance the motivational power which may reduce or eliminate any inherent advantage of cash as an incentive to employees. However research on reward program influences in Malaysian private organizations is almost non-existent. Literature also suggests that non-monetary rewards alone do not motivate. This study focuses on the antecedents of cultural orientation, Islam Hadhari’s principles and environmental factors (internal and external) that may influence the perception held by <b>exempt</b> <b>employees</b> of Malaysian private organizations on non-monetary and monetary rewards. This study further investigates {{the relationship between the}} Malaysian cultural orientation, Islam Hadhari’s principles, environmental factors and perceptions of non-monetary and monetary rewards toward the reward program influences. The other important aim of the study is to identify the moderating role of organizational characteristics, i. e. organization size and ownership status between cultural orientations, Islam Hadhari’s principles, environmental factors (internal and external) and perceptions of non-monetary and monetary rewards. The study adopted a positivist paradigm and a two-phase sequential mixed method research design consisting of qualitative and quantitative approaches. A tentative research model was first developed based on an extensive literature review. In the first phase, the qualitative field study was then carried out to explore the perceptions of non-monetary and monetary rewards in the Malaysian private organizations. The findings from the qualitative study were then combined with initial research model and literature review to develop the final research model, which was then used to develop measures and instruments. In {{the second phase of the}} study, data were collected by questionnaire survey of 1000 <b>exempt</b> <b>employees</b> in Malaysian private organizations. 329 valid questionnaires were obtained. The responses were analyzed using Partial Least Square (PLS) based Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) approach. The results of this study showed that femininity orientation, Islam Hadhari’s principles specifically mastery of knowledge and good quality of life, and external environmental factors have positive influences on employees’ perceptions of non-monetary and monetary rewards. However, surprisingly the relationship between internal environmental factors, Islam Hadhari’s principles of balance and comprehensive economic development, and also cultural and moral integrity and non-monetary and monetary rewards were found to be non-significant in this study. This study also confirmed the influence of non-monetary rewards on reward program influences of employees’ contribution, productivity, loyalty except employees’ turnover was found to be non-significant in this study. The results also showed that perception of monetary rewards was significant in relation to employees’ contribution, productivity, loyalty as well as turnover. The findings also revealed the negative/positive, and also significant and nonsignificant relationships between the factors tested in this study in the existence of the moderating variables of organizational size and ownership status. The detailed of the results were discussed comprehensively in the thesis. This study contributes to the existing literature as there has been little evidence and attention found in the literature relating to cultural orientation, Islam Hadhari’s principles and environmental factors (internal and external) with non-monetary and monetary rewards. This study also indicates that Islam Hadhari’s principles does play a very important role in encouraging the intellectual, spiritual (intrinsic rewards) and physical development in Malaysia. The study also will benefit the human resource practitioners theoretically and practically by providing direction and suggestions in designing and implementing the nonmonetary and monetary rewards for Malaysian private organizations from Islamic perspectives...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. P. P. A., Public Policy and Administration) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2011. In California state government, two unique {{employee}} classifications exist, the Career Executive Assignment (CEA) and exempt. These two classifications {{are in the}} top-levels {{of government}} and are responsible for influencing policy through creation and implementation. We know that the exempt classification exists in virtually every state and federal government. The CEA civil service classification is a model system, and {{the first of its}} kind in the United States. But what else do we know about CEAs and what differences exist between the two classifications? This thesis uses an exploratory research approach to analyze a state personnel survey that assesses executive development opportunities and deficiencies. I examine questions that focus on organizational and employee performance measures, needed executive proficiencies, and general demographic information. 	Data for this thesis come from the California Department of Personnel Administration Executive Competency Survey. CEA and exempt classifications received the 222 question survey in October of 2009. I examine 76 questions closed-ended questions from 398 executive respondents using statistical analysis software and conducting simple cross-tabulations. 	Results suggest that CEAs and exempts are similar with respect to many demographic traits and attitudes, but there are a few notable differences between the two groups. The demographic findings are interesting and may help state personnel officials prepare for upcoming retirements. Gender composition is similar to the overall state workforce, ethnicity is primarily white, and executives are highly educated. Contrary to prior literature, the present study found that exempt respondents have served as executives longer than CEAs. Both groups of executives monitor and measure organizational performance. Supporting legislative intent, they both feel it is very important to implement programs and policies that reflect higher-management policies. Differences include CEAs having a greater concern for employee and program performance, while <b>exempt</b> <b>employees</b> believe they need a higher proficiency in change leadership, forwarding thinking, and vision and strategic thinking.
