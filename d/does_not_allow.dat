5|$|Although 247Bk is {{the most}} stable isotope of berkelium, its {{production}} in nuclear reactors is very inefficient due to the long half-life of its potential progenitor curium-247, which <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> it sufficient time to beta decay before capturing another neutron. Thus, 249Bk {{is the most}} accessible isotope of berkelium, which still, is available only in small quantities (only 0.66grams have been produced in the US over the period 1967–1983) at a high price of the order 185 USD per microgram.|$|E
5|$|Because {{glass is}} very brittle in its solid state, {{it is often}} prone to {{cracking}} upon heating and cooling, especially if the heating and cooling are uneven. This is because the brittleness of glass <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> for uneven thermal expansion. Glass that has been welded will usually need to be cooled very slowly and evenly through the glass transition, in a process called annealing, to relieve any internal stresses created by a temperature gradient.|$|E

5|$|High {{mortality}} {{rates have been}} recorded in the Serengeti. In a 1994 study, nearly 77% of litters died before eight weeks of birth, and nearly 83% of those alive could not make it to adolescence (14weeks). Lions emerged as the major predator of juveniles, accounting for nearly 78% of the deaths. The study concluded that the survival rate of cubs till weaning was a mere 4.8%. This was attributed to the open terrain of the region, which <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> cheetahs to conceal themselves. Cheetah cubs face higher mortality than most other large mammals.|$|E
