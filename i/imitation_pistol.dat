500|$|In June 2005, Aaron Lambert, a {{security}} guard at a book distribution centre in Corby, Northamptonshire, England, stole a number of pages from Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince six weeks before its intended publication date. He was arrested a day later after negotiations to sell them to John Askill, a journalist from The Sun, turned violent. Lambert reportedly fired a shot from his <b>imitation</b> Walther PPK <b>pistol,</b> but Askill was unharmed. At his trial the following October, Lambert pleaded guilty to threatening Askill and to attempting to blackmail Harry Potters publishers, Bloomsbury. In January 2006, Lambert was sentenced to {{four and a half}} years in prison. In November 2011, in her testimony before the Leveson Inquiry, Rowling said that the Sun had attempted to [...] "blackmail" [...] her into a photo-op in return for returning the stolen manuscript.|$|R
5000|$|On 24 November 2006, at 11:16, Stone {{was arrested}} for {{attempting}} to enter Parliament Buildings at Stormont armed with an <b>imitation</b> Beretta 92FS <b>pistol,</b> a knife and a [...] "viable" [...] bomb, after placing 8 [...] "pipe bombs" [...] within the grounds of Stormont. Three civilian security guards disarmed him {{as he entered the}} building, by trapping him within the revolving doors of the main lobby entrance. The security guards were injured during the struggle with Stone. Following the security breach, the building was evacuated and a British Army Bomb Disposal Unit was called to examine the suspect device. Before entering the building he had scrawled an incomplete graffiti stating [...] "Sinn FÃ©in IRA murderers" [...] on the Parliament building. Later examination from the bomb squad revealed that the bag Stone had been carrying contained between six and eight viable explosive devices. Sir Hugh Orde, the Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, said [...] "their potential for death, destruction and injury is being assessed" [...] but added they were [...] "fairly amateurish". As a result of Stone's actions, talks between political parties about power-sharing and the election of a First Minister, which had only just resumed, had to be abandoned.|$|R
