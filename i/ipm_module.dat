40|$|Implementation of Integrated Pest and Disease Management {{programme}} in irrigated cauliflower crop led to {{reduction in}} number of conventional pesticide sprays by 50 - 60 %. The safer biorational pesticides, insect growth regulators and cultural methods of pest management as introduced in the IPM programme were well received by the farmers in farmersâ€™ participatory trainings (FPT). Lower insect and disease incidence with higher curd production was observed in the IPM fields as compared to conventional non IPM fields. Furthermore the module was able to drag the cost of crop protection down by 45 percent resulting in higher benefit-cost ratio. The <b>IPM</b> <b>module</b> led to reinforcement of natural enemies resulting in sustainable and stable pest control regime warranting less pesticide application. Cotesia glomeratus L. was found parasitizing the larvae of Spodoptera litura F. in IPM fields whereas there was no parasitization in non IPM fields. Post implementation evaluation of the IPM programme revealed that the farmers were educated about the right choice of pesticides, proper time and dose of application, pest monitoring and application of pesticides based on action threshold. Increase in participation {{of women in the}} IPM programme was ensured by educating them about the mechanical management of S. litura. </p...|$|E

Faisalabad, Multan and Rahim Yaar Khan, temperature dependent biological parameters, drought influence on H. armigera along its natural enemies [C. carnea (Stephens) and H. hebetor (Say) ] and development of <b>IPM</b> <b>module</b> against H. armigera in cotton agro-ecosystem. The maximum population of adults and larvae of H. armigera recorded {{during the month of}} August was 4. 10 per trap and 0. 52 per plant, respectively. The lowest population was recorded in October, with values of 0. 87 adults per trap and 0. 12 larvae per plant. Population of C. carnea was highest (0. 90 per plant) in September and the lowest number (0. 21 per plant) was recorded in July. Similarly, parasitism rates were highest (33. 7 %) and lowest (04. 87 %) in September and July, respectively. Adults and larvae of H. armigera were highest in R. Y. Khan i. e. 3. 48 and 0. 44 per plant, respectively. In contrast, C. carnea population was highest (0. 72 per plant) in Faisalabad which was followed by Multan (0. 55 per plant) and R. Y. Khan (0. 38 per plant). Parasitism was also high in the district Faisalabad (13. 39 %) followed by Multan (6. 36 %) and R. Y. Khan (6. 23 %). Adults and larvae were positively correlated with temperature and r values were calculated at 0. 5818 and 0. 5240, respectively. Population of C. carnea was negatively correlated with temperature with an r value of - 0. 5546. Similarly, the parasitism of H. armigera by H. hebetor was negatively correlated with temperature (r= - 0. 5768). Higher temperatures decreased the duration of development and also decreased the reproductive capacity of H. armigera, C. carnea and H. hebetor. Degree days for developmental period for H. armigera, C. carnea and H. hebetor were 250, 166. 67 and 71. 43, respectively. The drought caused significant detrimental effects on population of H. armigera and parasitism by H. hebetor. In contrast, C. carnea population was not significantly (F= 2. 01, DF= 4 and P> 0. 05) affected by drought. The maximum yield was recorded 1639. 52 kg/ha (16. 0 kg/plot) in T 15 [T 1 (spray of Spinosad) + T 2 (spray of neem seed kernel extract) + T 3 (release of C. carnea) + T 4 (release of H. hebetor) ] which was followed by T 12 [T 1 (spray of Spinosad) + T 2 (spray of neem seed kernel extract) + T 4 (releases of H. hebetor) ] and T 13 [T 1 (spray of Spinosad) + T 3 (release of C. carnea) + T 4 (release of H. hebeor) ] with values of 1475. 568 and 1332. 11 kg/ha, respectively. T 1 (spray of Spinosad), T 5 [(spray of Spinosad) + (spray of neem seed kernel extract) ] and T 15 proved the most economical pest management modules exhibiting CBR 1 : 6 followed by T 7 [(sprays of Spinosad) + (releases of H. hebetor) ] and T 12 [(spray of Spinosad) + (spray of neem seed kernel extract) + (releases of H. hebetor) ] which explained a CBR of 1 : 5. 5 approximately...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{accuracy}} of the servo system {{is dependent on the}} speed or band width of the closed loop control system. To achieve the high speed closed loop operation, hardware oriented control is preferred and it is achieved by means of an ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Chip). The servo system is used to drive a two axis robotic arm moving in a plane where two PMSM motor with servo control provides the required motion. Robotic applications require quick and accurate changes in driving torque so that the required motion behaviour is attained. Quick change in operating flux is required for fast and accurate servo control. Conventional scalar control drives cannot achieve quick response time and hence vector control is employed. The IRMCK 201 ASIC used in the application has the Vector Control algorithm hard wired into it for complete servo control of a single PMSM. It takes the position and current feed back by using shaft encoder, hall sensor and IR 2175 Current sensing IC.

Organic (and ferrocyanide) destruction removes the compounds responsible for waste safety issues, and conditions the supernatant for low-level waste disposal by removing compounds that may be responsible for promoting strontium and transuranic (TRU) components solubility. Destruction or defunctionalization of complexing organics in tank wastes eliminates organic species that can reduce the efficiency of radionuclide (E. g., {sup 90 }Sr) separation processes, such as ion exchange, solvent extraction, and precipitation.

40|$|A set of {{automated}} planning algorithms is {{the current}} operations baseline approach for the Intelligent Payload <b>Module</b> (<b>IPM)</b> of the proposed Hyper spectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) mission. For this operations concept, there are only local (e. g. non-depletable) operations constraints, such as real-time downlink and onboard memory, and the forward sweeping algorithm is optimal for determining which science products should be generated onboard and on ground based on geographical overflights, science priorities, alerts, requests, and onboard and ground processing constraints. This automated planning approach was developed for the HyspIRI IPM concept. The HyspIRI IPM is proposed to use an X-band Direct Broadcast (DB) capability that would enable data to be delivered to ground stations virtually as it is acquired. However, the HyspIRI VSWIR and TIR instruments will produce approximately 1 Gbps data, while the DB capability is 15 Mbps for a approx. = 60 X oversubscription. In order to address this mismatch, this innovation determines which data to downlink based on both the type of surface the spacecraft is overflying, and the onboard processing of data to detect events. For example, when the spacecraft is overflying Polar Regions, it might downlink a snow/ice product. Additionally, the onboard software will search for thermal signatures indicative of a volcanic event or wild fire and downlink summary information (extent, spectra) when detected, thereby reducing data volume.

40|$|A central goal of {{integrated}} pest management (IPM) {{is to reduce the}} unnecessary use of pesticides. For Iowa growers, IPM can improve the economic and environmental performance of corn and soybean production. A successful IPM system begins with correctly identifying pests and disease, then understanding the biophysical relationships between them and the crops they attack. The Iowa State University (ISU) Corn and Soybean Initiative staff in collaboration with ISU faculty and staff in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and ISU Extension has developed four field guidesâ€”one specific to corn and three to soybeanâ€”to aid pest and disease identification in the field. The ISU soybean and corn field guides were developed for widespread distribution in Iowa and neighboring states. These guides are meant to be convenient, basic references for teaching the principles of IPM for the two most widely grown crops in Iowa. The Corn and Soybean Initiative has disseminated over 250, 000 guides to growers, crop advisers, agribusiness professionals, and agricultural educators as a resource to support IPM-based management decisions. For growers and crop advisers, the guides are meant to improve the ability to scout pests and make decisions in the field. For educators, the Corn and Soybean Initiative staff developed PowerPoint modules that illustrate general IPM principles and facilitate the teaching of IPM in the classroom. In fall 2009, the Corn and Soybean Initiative received a grant from the Iowa Resource Enhancement and Protection (REAP) Conservation Education Program (CEP) to 1) develop <b>IPM</b> learning <b>modules</b> for use in agricultural education classrooms, 2) distribute the field guides and modules to agricultural educators across Iowa, and 3) evaluate the effectiveness and utility of those resources and collect feedback on ways that they might be improved.

30|$|It is {{not easy}} to acquire a desired high dynamic range (HDR) image {{directly}} from a camera due to the limited dynamic range of most image sensors. Therefore, generally, a post-process called HDR image reconstruction is used, which reconstructs an HDR image from a set of differently exposed images to overcome the limited dynamic range. However, conventional HDR image reconstruction methods suffer from noise factors and ghost artifacts. This {{is due to the fact}} that the input images taken with a short exposure time contain much noise in the dark regions, which contributes to increased noise in the corresponding dark regions of the reconstructed HDR image. Furthermore, since input images are acquired at different times, the images contain different motion information, which results in ghost artifacts. In this paper, we propose an HDR image reconstruction method which reduces the impact of the noise factors and prevents ghost artifacts. To reduce the influence of the noise factors, the weighting function, which determines the contribution of a certain input image to the reconstructed HDR image, is designed to adapt to the exposure time and local motions. Furthermore, the weighting function is designed to exclude ghosting regions by considering the differences of the luminance and the chrominance values between several input images. Unlike conventional methods, which generally work on a color image processed by the image processing <b>module</b> (<b>IPM),</b> the proposed method works directly on the Bayer raw image. This allows for a linear camera response function and also improves the efficiency in hardware implementation. Experimental results show that the proposed method can reconstruct high-quality Bayer patterned HDR images while being robust against ghost artifacts and noise factors.|$|R

The Spectrasat concept represented an evolution of the technologies and operation strategies employed on EO-I. The Spectrasat concept had been preceded by two community-based missions proposed by Susan Ustin, UC Davis and Robert Green, NASA JPL. As a result of community participation, starting at this AVIRIS Workshop, the Spectrasat proposal evolved into the Flora concept which now represents the combined visions of Gregory Asner (Carnegie Institute), Stephen Ungar, Robert Green and Robert Knox, NASA GSFC. Flora is a proposed imaging spectrometer mission, designed to address global carbon cycle science issues. This mission centers on measuring ecological disturbance for purposes of ascertaining changes in global carbon stocks and draws heavily on experience gained through AVIRIS airborne flights and Hyperion space born flights. The observing strategy exploits the improved ability of imaging spectrometers, as compared with multi-spectral observing systems, to identify vegetation functional groups, detect ecosystem response to disturbance and assess the related discovery. Flora will be placed in a sun synchronous orbit, with a 45 meter pixel size, a 90 km swath width and a 31 day repeat cycle. It covers the spectral range from 0. 4 to 2. 5 micrometers with a spectral sampling interval of 10 nm. These specifications {{meet the needs of the}} Flora science team under the leadership of Gregory Asner. Robert Green, has introduced a spectrometer design for Flora which is expected to have a SNR of 600 : 1 in the VNIR and 450 : 1 in the SWIR. The mission team at NASA GSFC is designing an Intelligent Payload <b>Module</b> (<b>IPM)</b> designed to effectively reduce the volume of data required to be transmitted down to the ground. This paper discusses mission science objectives, describes the mission concept and presents the current status of possible funding opportunities leading to realization of the mission...|$|R
40|$|In many {{industrial}} plants materials {{have to be}} transported between several processing stations, {{where they have to}} be processed {{with a high level of}} accuracy and precision. In the last years, linear electrical drives, especially the long-stator linear motors are used for these types of applications for both processing and transportation tasks. They have higher dynamics and processing precision and lower maintenance costs compared to conventional systems, which require additional mechanical gears. The linear drive system must be modular and highly scalable in order to cover a wide range of applications. For this reason, the track of the plant is made of several stator segments. The excitation part of the motor is represented by permanent magnets (passive vehicles). Each stator segment has a dedicated inverter (Power Processing Unit) and processor (Information Processing Unit). Cheap <b>IPMs</b> (Intelligent Power <b>Modules)</b> are nowadays a good solution for implementing the inverter. A DSP was used as processor. The DSP and the IPM are the main components of the designed servo-controller, which together with a stator segment represents a module of the system. The DSP controls the inverter and is also used for the communication with the DSPs of the adjacent modules. By connecting the ground potential of all servo-controllers to the negative DC-link rail (ca. - 280 V), a significant reduction in the implementation costs of the servo-controller was achieved. When a vehicle crosses from one stator segment to the adjacent one, the control tasks migrate physically in that respective adjacent DSP. Data exchange is therefore required within each cycle of the current control loop (100 Âµs) between the adjacent modules. For an arbitrary scalable modular system, there will be also an arbitrary high communication demand. This demand can only be solved by a direct (Point-to-Point) connection between the adjacent DSPs. This connection was realised by means of the cost-effective RS 485 data transmission protocol. A central control unit is responsible then for the cyclical (1 - 10 ms) generation of new position reference values for the vehicles, according to a predefined schedule. The monitoring (assessment of internal variables of the distributed servo-controllers) of the entire system is realised also in real-time. Off-line download and upload actions of firmware or general data is also possible. For these tasks, the communication between the central unit (PC) and the distributed servocontrollers was realised by means of the Ethernet-based fieldbus EtherCAT. Inside the processing stations of the system, the positioning accuracy and precision as well as the dynamic have to be very good. For this reason, inside those stations, position sensors must be used. Outside those stations, for material transportation only, an EMF-based sensorless control was implemented. This will further reduce the overall system costs. A small section of such modular and highly scalable system was realised as an experimental set-up in the context of this work, in order to test the functionality and the reliability of the proposed system...|$|R
40|$|The NASA HyspIRI {{mission is}} planned to provide global solar {{reflected}} energy spectroscopic {{measurement of the}} terrestrial and shallow water regions of the Earth every 19 days will all measurements downlinked. In addition, HyspIRI will provide multi-spectral thermal measurements with a single band in the 4 micron region and seven bands in the 8 to 12 micron region with 5 day day/night coverage. A direct broadcast capability for measurement subsets is also planned. This HyspIRI mission {{is one of those}} designated in the 2007 National Research Council (NRC) Decadal Survey: Earth Science and Applications from Space. In the Decadal Survey, HyspIRI was recognized as relevant to a range of Earth science and science applications, including climate: "A hyperspectral sensor (e. g., FLORA) combined with a multispectral thermal sensor (e. g., SAVII) in low Earth orbit (LEO) is part of an integrated mission concept [described in Parts I and II] that is relevant to several panels, especially the climate variability panel. " The HyspIRI science study group was formed in 2008 to evaluate and refine the mission concept. This group has developed a series of HyspIRI science objectives: (1) Climate: Ecosystem biochemistry, condition & feedback; spectral albedo; carbon/dust on snow/ice; biomass burning; evapotranspiration (2) Ecosystems: Global plant functional types, physiological condition, and biochemistry including agricultural lands (3) Fires: Fuel status, fire frequency, severity, emissions, and patterns of recovery globally (4) Coral reef and coastal habitats: Global composition and status (5) Volcanoes: Eruptions, emissions, regional and global impact (6) Geology and resources: Global distributions of surface mineral resources and improved understanding of geology and related hazards These objectives are achieved with the following measurement capabilities. The HyspIRI imaging spectrometer provides: full spectral coverage from 380 to 2500 at 10 nm sampling; 60 m spatial sampling with a 150 km swath; and fully downlinked coverage of the Earth's terrestrial and shallow water regions every 19 days to provide seasonal cloud-free coverage of the terrestrial surface. The HyspIRI Multi-Spectral Thermal instrument provides: 8 spectral bands from 4 to 12 microns; 60 m spatial sampling with a 600 km swath; and fully downlinked coverage of the Earth's terrestrial shallow water regions every 5 days (day/night) to provide nominally cloud-free monthly coverage. The HyspIRI mission also includes an on-board processing and direct broadcast capability, referred to as the Intelligent Payload <b>Module</b> (<b>IPM),</b> which will allow users with the appropriate antenna to download a subset of the HyspIRI data stream to a local ground station. These science and science application objectives are critical today and uniquely addressed by the combined imaging spectroscopy, thermal infrared measurements, and IPM direct broadcast capability of HyspIRI. Two key objectives are: (1) The global HyspIRI spectroscopic measurements of the terrestrial biosphere including vegetation composition and function to constrain and reduce the uncertainty in climate-carbon interactions and terrestrial biosphere feedback. (2) The global 8 band thermal measurements to provide improved constraint of fire related emissions. In this paper the current HyspIRI mission concept that has been reviewed and refined to its current level of maturity with a Data Products Symposium, Science Workshop and NASA HWorkshop is presented including traceability between the measurements and the science and science application objectives...|$|R
40|$|The Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) {{mission was}} {{recommended}} for implementation by the 2007 {{report from the}} U. S. National Research Council Earth Science and Applications from Space: National Imperatives for the Next Decade and Beyond, {{also known as the}} Earth Science Decadal Survey. The HyspIRI mission is science driven and will address a set of science questions identified by the Decadal Survey and broader science community. The mission includes a visible shortwave infrared (VSWIR) imaging spectrometer, a multispectral thermal infrared (TIR) imager and an intelligent payload <b>module</b> (<b>IPM).</b> The IPM enables on-board processing and direct broadcast for those applications with short latency requirements. The science questions are organized as VSWIR-only, TIR-only and Combined science questions, the latter requiring data from both instruments. In order to prepare for the mission NASA is undertaking pre-phase A studies to determine the optimum mission implementation, in particular, cost and risk reduction activities. Each year the HyspIRI project is provided with feedback from NASA Headquarters on the pre-phase A activities {{in the form of a}} guidance letter which outlines the work that should be undertaken the subsequent year. The 2013 guidance letter included a recommendation to undertake a study to determine the science impact of deploying the instruments from separate spacecraft in sun synchronous orbits with various time separations and deploying both instruments on the International Space Station (ISS). This report summarizes the results from that study. The approach taken was to evaluate the impact on the combined science questions of time separations between the VSWIR and TIR data of < 3 minutes, < 1 week and a few months as well as deploying both instruments on the ISS. Note the impact was only evaluated for the combined science questions which require data from both instruments (VSWIR and TIR). The study concluded the impact of a separation of < 3 minutes was minimal, e. g. if the instruments were on separate platforms that followed each other in a train. The impact of a separation of < 1 week was strongly dependent on the question that was being addressed with no impact for some questions and a severe impact for others. The impact of a time separation of several months was severe and in many cases it was no longer possible to answer the sub-question. The impact of deploying the instruments on the ISS which is in a precessive (non-sun synchronous) orbit was also very question dependent, in some cases it was possible to go beyond the original question, e. g. to examine the impact of the diurnal cycle, whereas in other cases the question could not be addressed for example if the question required observations from the polar regions. As part of the study, the participants were asked to estimate, as a percentage, how completely a given sub-question could be answered with 100 % indicating the question could be completely answered. These estimations should be treated with caution but nonetheless can be useful in assessing the impact. Averaging the estimates for each of the combined questions the results indicate that 97 % of the questions could be answered with a separation of < 3 minutes. With a separation of < 1 week, 67 % of the questions could be answered and with a separation of several months only 21 % of the questions could be answered...|$|R
