5|$|The {{architect}} Jean-Nicolas Huyot gave {{very precise}} instructions to this section. Of wide-ranging experience formed in Asia Minor and Egypt {{and under the}} influence of engineers, <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> to keep an authentic diary of their excavations where precision measurements read off watches and compasses should be written down, to draw a map of the region they travelled, and to describe the layout of the terrain.|$|E
5|$|Years later colonial trader Ludovick Grant, {{who lived}} in Great Tellico and briefly {{accompanied}} Cuming during his tour, described the latter's techniques. In each town, Cuming arranged a meeting with local Cherokee leaders. He arrived fully armed at the meeting at the town council house, in defiance of custom. There he made a prepared speech {{saying that he was}} a private citizen wishing only to see their country, and that if any Indians wished to return to England with him, he would take them. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> to join his party in a toast to the health of King George II, and to kneel in allegiance. He told his guides that he would have set fire to the townhouse and killed the assembled Indians if they refused.|$|E
5|$|As {{demands for}} a {{parliament}} grew, Charles took {{the unusual step of}} summoning a great council of peers. By the time it met, on 24 September at York, Charles had resolved to follow the almost universal advice to call a parliament. After informing the peers that a parliament would convene in November, <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> to consider how he could acquire funds to maintain his army against the Scots in the meantime. They recommended making peace. A cessation of arms, although not a final settlement, was negotiated in the humiliating Treaty of Ripon, signed in October 1640. The treaty stated that the Scots would continue to occupy Northumberland and Durham and be paid Â£850 per day until peace was restored and the English Parliament recalled, which would be required to raise sufficient funds to pay the Scottish forces. Consequently, Charles summoned what later became known as the Long Parliament. Once again, Charles's supporters fared badly at the polls. Of the 493 members of the Commons returned in November, over 350 were opposed to the king.|$|E

5|$|He {{had been}} hit by a {{marksman}} from the Redoutable, firing at a range of 50feet (15m). The bullet had entered his left shoulder, passed through his spine at the sixth and seventh thoracic vertebrae, and lodged two inches (5cm) below his right shoulder blade in the muscles of his back. Nelson was carried below by sergeant-major of marines Robert Adair and two seamen. As he was being carried down, <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> to pause while he gave some advice to a midshipman on the handling of the tiller. He then draped a handkerchief over his face to avoid causing alarm amongst the crew. He was taken to the surgeon William Beatty, telling him You can do nothing for me. I have but a short time to live. My back is shot through. Nelson was made comfortable, fanned and brought lemonade and watered wine to drink after he complained of feeling hot and thirsty. He asked several times to see Hardy, who was on deck supervising the battle, and asked Beatty to remember him to Emma, his daughter and his friends.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, Sverdrup {{joined with}} his former University of Minnesota {{engineering}} professor John Ira Parcel {{in the formation of}} Sverdrup & Parcel, a civil engineering firm with a speciality field of bridges. Parcel had tenure at Minnesota {{for a long time and}} was reluctant to sever his ties completely, but eventually he decided to join the new company, taking an unpaid Sabbatical from the university for one year. Sverdrup owned 60% and Parcel 40%of the new firm, which opened its doors on 1 April 1928. The company's headquarters was located in St. Louis, Missouri. Sverdrup & Parcel's first contract was for the design of a bridge over the Missouri River at Hermann, Missouri, for which it received a fee of $33,000. While at the Missouri State Highway Department Sverdrup met D. C. Wolfe and E. R. Grant, and <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> if they would join the company. Sverdrup subsequently hired design engineer Brice R. Smith from Missouri's leading supplier of bridge components. By 1936, all three would become partners in the firm.|$|E
5|$|Leclerc {{objected to}} the use of his troops in the attack on Royan in April 1945. As a result, only part of 2e DB was employed. The {{division}} rejoined Seventh Army, crossing the Rhine on 25 April, and joining the pursuit into Bavaria. Leclerc visited Dachau concentration camp after its liberation by the Americans. In an incident that took place 8 May 1945 at Bad Reichenhall in Bavaria, he was presented with a defiant group of captured Frenchmen of the SS Charlemagne Division. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> why they wore a German uniform, to which one of them replied by asking why Leclerc wore an American one. Leclerc told his men to get rid of them. That was taken as a death sentence. The group of French Waffen-SS men was summarily executed by the RMT without any form of military tribunal procedure, and their bodies left where they fell until an American burial team collected them. For his services leading the 2e DB, Leclerc was awarded the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour.|$|E

25|$|In December 1946, {{after meeting}} with White and other leaders of the NAACP, and {{a month after the}} jury acquitted Shull, Truman {{established}} the Civil Rights Commission by Executive Order 9808; a 15-member, interracial group, including the President of General Electric, Charles E. Wilson, academics such as John Sloan Dickey from Dartmouth College, and Sadie Tanner Alexander, a black attorney for the city of Philadelphia, as well as other activists. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> to report by the end of 1947.|$|E

25|$|The Confederate {{public had}} mixed {{feelings}} about the result, joy at Lee's tactical victory tempered {{by the loss of}} their most beloved general, Stonewall Jackson. The death of Jackson caused Lee to make the long-needed reorganization of the Army of Northern Virginia from two large corps into three, under James Longstreet, Richard S. Ewell, and A.P. Hill. The new assignments for the latter two generals caused some command difficulties in the upcoming Gettysburg Campaign, which began in June. Of more consequence for Gettysburg, however, was the supreme confidence that Lee gained from his great victory at Chancellorsville, that his army was virtually invincible and would succeed at anything <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> to do.|$|E

25|$|It {{has become}} {{possible}} {{to study the}} living brain, and researchers can now watch the brain's decision-making process at work. A seminal experiment in this field was conducted by Benjamin Libet in the 1980s, in which he asked each subject to choose a random moment to flick their wrist while he measured the associated activity in their brain; in particular, the build-up of electrical signal called the readiness potential (after German Bereitschaftspotential, which was discovered by Kornhuber & Deecke in 1965). Although it was well known that the readiness potential reliably preceded the physical action, Libet asked whether it could be recorded before the conscious intention to move. To determine when subjects felt the intention to move, <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> to watch the second hand of a clock. After making a movement, the volunteer reported {{the time on the}} clock when they first felt the conscious intention to move; this became known as Libet's W time.|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} 1937, Street & Smith {{promoted}} Tremaine to assistant editorial director, and {{his place}} as editor of Astounding was taken by John W. Campbell. [...] A few months later Street & Smith let Tremaine go, and gave Campbell a freer hand with the magazine. [...] Campbell immediately changed the title from Astounding Stories to Astounding Science-Fiction; his editorial policy was targeted at the more mature readers of science fiction, and he felt that [...] "Astounding Stories" [...] did not convey the right image. [...] He also asked his cover artists to produce more sober and less sensational artwork than had been the case under Tremaine. [...] His most important change was in the expectations he placed on his writers: <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> to write stories that felt as though {{they could have been}} published as non-sf stories in a magazine of the future.

500|$|The Crossroads Movement later {{spread into}} some other Churches of Christ.

500|$|Elections {{subsequently}} {{took place}} in December 1944. Although only literate men were allowed to vote, the elections were broadly considered free and fair. Unlike in similar historical situations, none of the junta members stood for election. The winner of the 1944 elections was a teacher named Juan JosÃ© ArÃ©valo, who ran under a coalition of leftist parties known as the [...] "Partido AcciÃ³n Revolucionaria'" [...] ("Revolutionary Action Party", PAR), and won 85% of the vote. Arana {{did not wish to}} turn over power to a civilian administration. He initially tried to persuade Ãrbenz and Toriello to postpone the election, and after ArÃ©valo was elected, <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> to declare the results invalid. Ãrbenz and Toriello insisted that ArÃ©valo be allowed to take power, which Arana reluctantly agreed to, on the condition that Arana's position as the commander of the military be unchallenged. ArÃ©valo {{had no choice but to}} agree to this, and so the new Guatemalan constitution, adopted in 1945, created a new position of [...] "Commander of the Armed Forces", a position that was more powerful than that of the defense minister.
