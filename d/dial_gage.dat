Furthermore, the accuracy of the radar fixes was evaluated by comparison with the cross bearing fixes. Through the EB distributed within± 1 °, most of them were maldistributed on the minus side and the mean values of the ED were negative in all ranges. We estimate that the main cause for these tendencies was that some errors were included in the Gyro Compass and also in the personal equations when matching the range marker or cursor line with the target and reading the <b>dial</b> <b>gage.</b> The standard deviations of the EB and the ED were 0. 56 degree and 0. 023 NM respectively, and the radar fixes showed higher accuracy than the cross bearing fixes in most ranges...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} method is described for measuring hygroscopic swelling strains and mechanical strains of moisture-conditioned composite specimens. The method consists of embedding encapsulated strain gages in the midplane of the composite laminate; thus {{it does not}} interfere with normal moisture diffusion. It is particularly suited for measuring moisture swelling coefficients and for mechanical testing of moisture-conditioned specimens at high strain rates. Results obtained by the embedded gage method were shown to be more reliable and reproducible than those obtained by surface <b>gages,</b> <b>dial</b> <b>gages,</b> or extensometers...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} study was carried put {{with the specific}} intention of reducing the undesirable effects of both high residual stresses and distortion in HY 100 and HY 130 high strength steels during welding. Tests were also conducted on Mild Steel for comparison. The goal of these tests was to first ascertain the distortion and residual stresses during and after welding of test pieces of the three different steels. Test specimens were: 5. 5 " wide by 18 " long and 0. 5 " thick. A nominal 20 KJ/inch heat input was used in all experiments. Bead on edge was utilized as representative of a butt weld. An automated GMA process was utilized for welding with 98 % argon and 2 % oxygen as shielding gas. The first phase of this experimental investigation established excellent temperature, strain, distortion profiles, and a baseline residual stress.

40|$|Tests {{conducted}} with a pierced light-gage, cold-formed steel channel {{were used to}} evaluate four different criteria for experimentally determining the elastic buckling loads of thin plates. The single test specimen was a ten foot length of a 14 -gage section with a nominal 8 " web and nominal 3 " lipped flanges. The section was loaded as a beam bent about its minor axis so that the web was placed in compression. A constant-moment mid-span region of five times the web width simulated a long plate subjected to in-plane compression. Tests of the unpierced specimen were followed by tests in which the specimen had a single hole {{in the center of}} the web. A repetitive process of flanging the plain holes and then cutting off the flanges created a succession of plain and reinforced holes of increasing diameter. A total of thirty-six tests were carried out. The specimen was instrumented with as many as forty electric strain <b>gages</b> and nine <b>dial</b> <b>gages.</b> The four buckling criteria considered were the maximum strain (or strain reversal) criterion, the top-of-the-knee criterion, the inflection point criterion, and the Southwell plot method. The last was judged to be the most accurate and appropriate, and it was applied in studying the effects of the hole on the elastic buckling load. The critical load was found to be insensitive to hole size for both plain and reinforced holes up to a hole diameter of about one-half the plate width. Tests were not conducted for large holes. The addition of a reinforcing lip increased the buckling load by over 50 %. The experimental results agree fairly well with the results of a finite element study...|$|R

40|$|A two-storey 3 bay x 3 bay, 1 / 12 scale, perspex {{flat slab}} model was tested under a one-bay uniformly {{distributed}} load, which was applied successively {{to the various}} bays. The load was applied using a rubber air bag. The moments induced in the model were measured by electrical resistance type strain gages and the deflections by <b>dial</b> <b>gages.</b> By analysis of the experimental results, and comparing them with the ACI 318 - 71 Direct Design Method, the following conclusions were obtained: The total static moment given by the ACI 318 - 71 Direct Design Method is accurate for all practical purposes. The width of the column strip specified by the ACI Code in Clause 13. 1. 2 of 0. 25 ℓ 2 but not greater than 0. 25 ℓ 1 results in too great a concentration of negative moment in the column strip. This concentration of moment in the column strip is even less justified for the positive moment where the column strip moment/unit width and the middle strip moments/unit width are of approximately equal magnitude. The effect of the concentration of positive moment in the column strip together with aforementioned restriction of {{the width of the}} column strip results in middle strip design positive moments 25 % less than those measured. The provision " 13. 3. 4. 6 " that a design moment may be adjusted by up to 10 % provided that the total static moment is not less than required should be changed by eliminating the 10 % limit. It is recommended that adjustment be applied to the negative moment only. The provisions for the effects of pattern loading " 13. 3. 6 " are insufficient. The limitation of live load to dead load ratios stated in " 13. 3. 1. 5 " results in a possibility of developing negative moments in or near mid span of interior panels...|$|R

Neste trabalho, apresenta-se resultados do estudo experimental de três paredes estruturais, construídas com tijolos de solo-cimento. Os tijolos foram fabricados com três diferentes proporções de materiais, nas quais duas delas tiveram parte do cimento substituído por resíduo cerâmico moído. As paredes apresentavam altura de 95, 20 cm, largura de 75, 32 cm e espessura de 12, 56 cm e tiveram seus tijolos rejuntados com pasta de cimento, que foram ensaiadas sob compressão centrada e tiveram seus deslocamentos avaliados por cinco relógios medidores de deslocamento. Observou-se comportamento estrutural satisfatório e resistências compatíveis com as requeridas pelas paredes das casas populares brasileiras. Em todos os casos, as diferenças entre as tensões máximas nas paredes e as resistências dos tijolos, foram inferiores a 20 %. Para concluir o estudo, realizou-se análise por meio do método dos elementos finitos (MEF) com o intuito de avaliar a uniformidade na distribuição das tensões ao longo das paredes.

40|$|Este trabalho tem como objetivo o de mostrar experimentalmente a influência que os paletes de madeira podem exercer no comportamento das estruturas de armazenagem do tipo {{drive in}} com um nível de carregamento. Considerar o palete com apoios móveis em ambos os braços da estrutura, ou por outro lado, desconsiderá-lo totalmente na análise estrutural, pode resultar em análises irreais, pois o atrito entre o palete e os trilhos pode influenciar no comportamento deste tipo de estrutura. A fim de se verificar a existência desta influência em condições próximas à realidade, dois pórticos com características semelhantes às dos fornecidos pelas empresas fabricantes foram testados com a utilização de três tipos de paletes com características semelhantes às dos paletes encontrados no mercado, com inércias variadas, apoiados sobre trilhos pintados. Estes paletes foram testados sobre trilhos com mesas abrasivas a fim de se verificarem possíveis diferenças nos deslocamentos entre as estruturas carregadas com paletes sobre trilhos pintados e entre as estruturas carregadas com paletes sobre trilhos com mesas abrasivas. Além disso, os pórticos foram testados com um palete suspenso com o objetivo de simular o modelo teórico elaborado pelo Slope-deflection. Cada pórtico foi testado com as forças verticais de 245 N, 490 N, 735 N e 980 N aplicadas nos braços e com a força {{horizontal}} de 1, 5 % correspondente ao valor da força vertical aplicada neste pórtico para simular possíveis forças horizontais aplicadas pelas empilhadeiras na movimentação dos materiais. Dois relógios comparadores com sensibilidade de 1 / 1000 mm e um com sensibilidade de um 1 / 100 mm, todos com curso de 10 mm, foram colocados, respectivamente, no topo e na base de cada uma das colunas de cada pórtico com o objetivo de se medirem os deslocamentos lineares e angulares destes pórticos. Os deslocamentos medidos nas extremidades de cada coluna foram úteis para se determinar os momentos fletores e as reações nas extremidades destas colunas. A influência dos paletes de madeira no comportamento das estruturas do tipo drivein foi verificada com nível de 5 % de significância através da análise da variânciaThis dissertation?s {{intent is to}} investigate experimentally the influence the wood pallets exert {{on the behavior of}} the drive in storage racks with one level of loading. To consider the pallets as roller supported on both rails of the structure implies in not to consider the influence of the friction between the pallets and the rails in the behavior of the structure, and thus the results obtained by the theoretical model of analysis may lead to results that may differ from the observed in the real structure. With the aim of investigating this influence in conditions {{as close as possible to}} the reality, two frames resembling those supplied by manufacturers were tested with three sort of pallets, each one with characteristics and dimensions resembling the pallets utilized by users, but with different resistance and inertia in comparison with each other. The same pallets were tested in the same frames, but this time on rails with an abrasive surface to verify the possible differences in displacements between the structures loaded with pallets on smooth surfaces rails and between structures loaded with pallets on abrasive surfaces rails. Furthermore, the frames were subjected to a suspense load with the aim of simulating the theoretical model of analysis. Each arm were tested with vertical forces of 245 N, 490 N, 735 N and 980 N. It was considered also the horizontal force of 1, 5 % of the vertical force acting on the frame to take into consideration the lift truck operation. With the aim of measuring the linear and angular displacements of these frames, two <b>dial</b> <b>gages</b> were positioned at the top and one was positioned at the bottom of each column. The readings of all linear and angular displacements at the end of the columns were useful for evaluating the bending moments, the horizontal and vertical reactions acting in each one of the end of the columns of these frames. The 8 elements considered (3 pallets on smooth surface rails, 3 pallets on abrasive surface rails, 1 suspense load and 1 for the Slope-Deflection Method) were combined in groups of 3, so that the influence of the wood pallets in the behavior of drive in racks can be investigated through the variance analysis with 5 % in the level of significanc...|$|R
