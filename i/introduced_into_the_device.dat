By analyzing many individual droplets and quantifying the data obtained against standard additions, we measured the level of two intracellular proteins, namely, HRas-mCitrine, expressed within HEK- 293 cells, and actin-EGFP, expressed within MCF- 7 cells. We determined the concentrations of these proteins over 5 orders of magnitude, from similar to 50 pM to 1 mu M.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{development}} of a simple poly(dimethylsiloxane) microfluidic device for high-efficiency trapping and sorting of micron-size particles. In this device, hydrodynamic fluid flow through the sieve-like microfluidic channel sequentially fills the trap positions with particles of the trap size, and particles smaller than the trap size pass through the sieve and are trapped by smaller traps downstream. By incorporating side channels alongside the main channel, we were able to decouple the fluidic flow in one stage from the flows in the other stages. This decoupling allows us to modularize each stage of the device regardless {{of the size of the}} entire device. In our demonstration experiment with the prototype, we showed that more than 85 % of the polystyrene microspheres (of sizes 15 μm, 6 μm and 4 μm) were sorted in the correct segment of the device that targets their respective sizes.

40|$|Abstract — A classical, broadly {{implemented}} testing method, {{often considered}} as a reference standardized testing method (e. g. MIL-STD- 810. 514) is the well-known random method. Although it commonly offers fast testing capability with relative good reliability, it presents two major drawbacks. Firstly, a basic control system generates an amplitude time signal following a normal (Gaussian) distribution with a (little) probability of having extremely high values exceeding the maximum admissible value for the amplifier which reduce the RMS level of the signal and the dynamic range of the testing facility. Secondly, {{the only way to}} reduce the crest factor and to avoid these extreme values consists of a sigma clipping truncating the signal and so increasing the PSD noise floor and reducing the dynamic range. Alternatively, the crest factor can be limited by using a multisine approach. A multisine composition can cover the same PSD requirements as the classical random by only dimensioning the amplitude of the sines. On the other hand, the phases can be chosen freely and, if good chosen, can lead to a reduced crest-factor (e. g. Schroeder phase coding). This article presents a comparison between the experimental results of both classical and pseudo-random methods. The analysis is done for a certain acceleration amplitude passing through the amplifier and <b>introduced</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>device</b> under test. Obtained FRFs will also be compared.

40|$|The {{development}} of a competitive immunoassay system for colorimetric detection on microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (mu PADs) is reported. The mu PADs were fabricated via photolithography to define hydrophilic flow channels and consisted of three main elements: the control and test zones, where target detection was performed, the sample introduction zone, and the competitive capture zone located between the sample introduction zone and the test zone. The chromogenic substrate 3, 3 ', 5, 5 '-tetra-methylbenzidine (TMB) was deposited at the control and test zones. mu PAD surface modification was performed at the capture zone first via chitosan activation, then the BSA-conjugated target compound was immobilized. The sample solution consisting of the target compound, the peroxidase-conjugated antibody, and the hydrogen peroxide oxidizing agent was <b>introduced</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>device</b> and competition occurred at the capture zone, allowing only the target-bound peroxidase-conjugated antibody to travel past the capture zone and into the test zone via capillary action.

The applicability of the proposed immunoassay system for point-of-need testing was further demonstrated using aflatoxin B- 1, a highly toxic foodborne substance, with a detection limit of 1. 31 ng mL(- 1).

40|$|With {{the end of}} Si based Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor scaling {{paradigm}} approaching fast {{as predicted}} by the Moore’s Law, and the technological advancements as well as human needs in many ways pushing for faster devices, graphene {{has emerged as a}} powerful alternative solution. This is so because of its very special properties like high charge carrier mobility, highly linear dispersion relation, high current carrying capacity and so on. However, since we have a finite resistance at Dirac point, the on/off ratio in graphene devices is sufficiently low, making graphene devices not so suitable for logical applications. At the same time, the 1 /f noise, which is understood till now to originate from surface disorders like those observed in a two-dimensional electron gas system like graphene and is a major unwanted outcome in mesoscopic regime devices, reduces very much at high frequencies, making these devices good candidates for high frequency analogue applications. Motivated by these observations, this work explores fabrication and characterization of graphene field effect transistors operating at microwave frequencies, and compares a double gated device performance to a mono-gated device having the same geometry, dielectric layer thickness and gate length.

40|$|Nonvolatile {{memory devices}} and random laser devices based on ZnO thin film and {{nanostructures}} are studied and {{discussed in this}} dissertation. The p-n-p nonvolatile memory was achieved by using Sb-ZnO/ZnO/Sb-ZnO structure in Chapter 2. Secondary ion mass spectrometry result confirmed {{the formation of the}} structure. Rectifying current-voltage characteristics between Sb-ZnO and undoped ZnO layers were achieved, proving the p-n junction was formed. The p-type behavior from the p-n-p structure was studied by using the capacitance-voltage measurement and small signal model. The voltage operation led to the charging/discharging of the structure, showing nonvolatile memory effect. Low writing voltage and long retention time were achieved. The n-p-n nonvolatile memory based on Na-doped ZnO nanostructures was also studied in Chapter 3. To achieve n-p-n nonvolatile memory, the Na-doped nanorods were grown on a ZnO seed layer on Si. The p-type conductivity of the Na-doped nanorods was studied by temperature-dependent photoluminescence and nanorod back-gated field effect transistor. Vertically aligned undoped ZnO nanotips, nanotubes and nanorods were synthesized on the top facets of Na-doped ZnO nanorods without catalytic assistance under different growth time in a chemical vapor deposition system. The undoped nanorods, Na-doped nanorods and undoped seed layer form an n-p-n memory structure. The programming and retention characteristics have been demonstrated. Furthermore, the bipolar resistive switching memory using Na-doped ZnO nanowire was also demonstrated in Chapter 4. The mechanism of the self-complianced and self-rectifying effect of the device was studied. 	The ZnO based optoelectronics devices are studied in Chapter 5 and 6. An electrically pumped ZnO homojunction random laser diode based on nitrogen doped p-type ZnO nanowires was achieved. The p-type behaviors were studied by output characteristic and transfer characteristic of the nanowire back-gated field effect transistor, as well as low-temperature photoluminescence. The formation of the p-n junction is confirmed by the current-voltage characteristic and electron-beam-induced current. The random lasing behaviors were demonstrated by using both optical pumping and electrical pumping, with a threshold of 300 kW/cm 2 and 40 mA, respectively. The angle dependant electroluminescence of the device further proved the random lasing mechanism.

40|$|In {{the recent}} years {{microfluidic}} technology has affirmed {{itself as a}} powerful tool in medical and biological research. Micro-flowcytometers, micromixers, cell sorters and cell analyzers are only few examples of the developed devices. Among these different applications, cell manipulation in microfluidics has been widely investigated. Various methods for cell manipulation have been proposed, such as hydrodynamic, magnetic, optical, mechanical, and electrical, in this way categorized according to the manipulating force employed. In particular, in manipulating cells by hydrodynamic forces, {{since there is no}} needing of applying external forces, the design and fabrication phases of the device are simplified, {{and at the same time}} undesired effects on the biological sample are avoided. This thesis has been focused on the design, fabrication and testing of microfluidic devices that allow to make a complete cell characterization by only exploiting hydrodynamic effects. The worldwide used technology for cell sample analysis is flowcytometry. Since cells focusing is the key point for the correct operation of a flowcytometer, several efforts have been made in order to reproducing it in a proper way on a micro-chip. In most cases, the traditional hydrodynamic focusing mechanism employing sheath fluid has been translated to the micro-scale. The main drawback in the approaches proposed till now, is that multiple inlets are needed. This brings to a high complexity if parallelization has to be <b>introduced</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>device.</b> However, conventional flow cytometry measurements lose some information, if we consider that for the fluorescent signal only the information related to the total intensity is collected. This means that it is not possible to know the fluorescent signal distribution on the cell surface. This limitation has been recently overcome by introducing a new procedure, known as imaging flow cytometry, that allows to image each cell at high speed and therefore make available also the fluorescent distribution. Nevertheless, the traditional approach used for imaging cells in microfluidic systems allows to image cells by a single point of view. A way in which cells can be imaged by different sides, without the needing of moving the acquisition system, is to induce cell rotation as they flow through the channel. In most of the microfluidic devices for hydrodynamic focusing multiple inlets are needed, and this is a limitation if you want to introduce more parallel channels. Starting from this consideration, the first part of this thesis has been related to the realization of a microfluidic device that allows to integrate hydrodynamic focusing and parallelization in a single device thanks to the fact that only one inlet is required. This is achieved by introducing a cross-filter region at each one of the parallel channels. On the second hand, in this thesis a microfluidic device that allow to control cell rotation by only taking advantage of hydrodynamic forces has been realized. The basic idea started from the consideration that, in a pressure driven flow, the velocity profile is parabolic. In particular, the velocity is minimum at the channel walls and reaches its maximum value at the center of the channel. This means that, if a cell is close to a channel wall, it will experience a velocity gradient on its surface, and therefore a rotation will be induced. A microfluidic device that allows to focus cells at the channel wall has been developed, and the correct device operation in inducing cell rotation has been tested by using asymmetrical shaped cells...|$|E

Vortex Induced Vibration (VIV) is a phenomenon where fluid flow cross flow bluff structure and cause vibration. VIV cause fatigue damage and premature failure of the marine riser. In order to extend the life of marine riser, there are two categories of method to control vibration, i. e. passive and active vibration control. Passive vibration control is a method where no energy is <b>introduced</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> system, <b>devices</b> are added to the vibrating structure and leave it to response to the vibration automatically.

In 98 paraffin-embedded CRC tissues, KRAS codon 12 mutations were discovered in 28 (28. 6 %), significantly higher than that obtained by direct sequencing (13, 13. 3 %). Clone sequencing confirmed these results and showed this system could detect at least 0. 4 % of the mutant KRAS in CRC tissue slides.

For this purpose several tests using a standard gas mixture have been performed on the GC-IRMS. The analyses showed no isotopic fractionation of C 1 – 5 hydrocarbons within 1 hour, minor δ 13 C enrichment after 5 hours, and significant enrichment after 22 hours for all the compounds at a temperature of 120 °C...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{a powerful and}} practical spectral interferometer with near-field scanning microscopy (NSOM) probes for measuring the spatiotemporal electric field of tightly focused ultrashort pulses with sub-micron spatial resolution and high spectral resolution. To make these measurements we use SEA TADPOLE which is a high spectral resolution, experimentally simplified version of spectral interferometry that uses fiber optics to <b>introduce</b> <b>the</b> pulse <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>device.</b> To measure <b>the</b> spatiotemporal field of focusing pulses, the entrance fiber is scanned around the focus and a measurement at each fiber position is made, so that E() is found at many positions along the beam's cross section {{so that we can}} reconstruct E(x, y, z,). The make these measurements we require that the fiber's mode size be smaller than the focused spot size. In the past using optical fibers we were limited to measuring foci with NA's less than 0. 1, and here by replacing the fiber with an NSOM fiber, we measure the spatiotemporal field of focused pulses with NAs as high as 0. 44. To demonstrate this technique we measured pulses that were focused with two different microscope objectives to verify that we achieved the expected results. We also measured foci that had severe distortions, such as the Bessellike X-shaped pulse caused by spherical aberrations and the "fore-runner pulse" due to chromatic aberrations and we verified these results with non-paraxial simulations. In our measurements we observed spatial features smaller than 1 m...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Many factors {{contribute}} to the high variability of doses delivered to the lungs of patients using metered dose inhalers (MDIs). Relatively {{little attention has been}} paid to the contribution to this variability of the way in which the MDI is handled before the inhalation manoeuvre. Instruction leaflets often recommend procedures at odds with those used for in vitro testing of <b>the</b> <b>device.</b> <b>The</b> standard protocol for in vitro assessment of salbutamol MDIs involves shaking the MDI vigorously for 30 seconds and wasting the first two actuations. Subsequent actuations are <b>introduced</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> testing <b>device</b> at five second intervals. Patient instructions do not include a recommendation to waste the first two actuations and recommend a delay of one minute between actuations. A series of experiments was performed to determine whether such differences might be important. METHODS [...] The total and "respirable" doses delivered by a salbutamol MDI (Ventolin, Allen & Hanburys) under various conditions were assessed with a multistage liquid impinger. The quantity of drug deposited on each stage was measured by an ultraviolet spectrophotometric method. The effect on the delivered dose of not shaking the canister, not wasting the first two doses, waiting 30 seconds between actuations, and using multiple rapid actuations was assessed by comparing the results with those obtained using the standard in vitro testing protocol. RESULTS [...] Compared with a standard protocol, it was found that not shaking the MDI before use reduced the total and "respirable" dose by 25. 5 % and 35. 7 %, respectively. The dose delivered when actuating the MDI at 30 second intervals was no different from that when intervals was no different from that when intervals of five seconds were used. Two actuations separated by one second had no effect on the total dose but reduced the "respirable" dose by 15. 8 %, while four rapid actuations reduced the total and "respirable" doses by 8. 2 % and 18. 2 %, respectively. Storing the MDI stem down reduced the total and "respirable" dose delivered in the first actuation by 25. 0 % and 23. 3 % despite shaking the MDI before use. CONCLUSIONS [...] MDIs containing drug in suspension must be shaken before use to resuspend the drug contained in the MDI, but shaking does not alter the composition of the suspension in the metering chamber and hence the dose in the first actuation remains low. Very rapid actuations can reduce the dose delivered per actuation, but salbutamol MDIs can be actuated immediately after a 10 second breath holding pause without affecting the dose delivered...|$|R
40|$|Spintronics is a {{multidisciplinary}} research field and it explores phenomena that interlink the spin and charge degrees of freedom. The thesis focuses on spin-polarized electronic transports in cobalt (Co) and fullerene (C 60) based vertical spintronic devices. It {{starts with a}} review about spin-transport phenomena in both inorganic and organic spintronic systems. Some topics, such as, magnetism of electrons, tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR), tunneling anisotropic magnetoresistance (TAMR), antiferromagnetic (AFM) TAMR, spin injection and spin polarization detection via Tedrow-Meservey measurements across ferromagnet-organic hybrid interfaces, and various spin-orbital coupling (SOC) effects, are covered. Chapter 2 contains the experimental studies of the TAMR in spintronic devices consisting of sapphire(substrate) /fcc-Co(8 nm) /AlOx(3. 3 nm) /Al(35 nm). The highlights of this project are spin-valve-like magnetic switching behaviour with single ferromagnet fcc-Co, and significant TAMR ratios at 5 K. The effect is primarily governed by the magnetic anisotropic property of the fcc-Co and spin-splitting of surface states via Rashba SOC. The following chapter deals with the tunnel junctions comprising Co and CoO interfaces. Since CoO has the unique AFM property, it shows a significant modification of the spin tunneling phenomena by comparing with <b>the</b> <b>devices</b> without CoO. <b>The</b> Co layer is exchange coupled to the CoO layer and drives rotation of the AFM moments in an external magnetic field. In chapter 4, the organic molecules, C 60, with different thicknesses were <b>introduced</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> same spintronic <b>devices</b> as they were described in Chapter 2. I have investigated spin-transport across the sapphire(substrate) /Co/AlOx/C 60 (2 nm to 8 nm) /Al tunnel junctions and concluded the Bychkov-Rashba SOI at different interfaces and resonant tunneling processes can contribute and influence the TAMR. Chapter 5 describes spin transport through Co/C 60 hybrid interfaces. I have studied how the interfacial states which are due to the hybridization of Co and C 60 impact on spin-transport. The phenomena {{can be attributed to}} the magnetic coupling between Co and the newly formed Co/C 60 hybrid interfacial states, which is expected to bring some interesting functionalities for organic spintronic applications. A tunnel spin polarization of approximately 43 % can be detected using the Tedrow-Meservey method. Chapter 6 provides perspectives for spintronics. Finally, a short summary will be given at the end of the thesis...|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} reported that gas-phase byproducts of incomplete oxidation were generated when a prototype ultraviolet photocatalytic oxidation (UVPCO) air cleaner was operated {{in the laboratory}} with indoor-relevant mixtures of VOCs at realistic concentrations. Under these conditions, there was net production of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, two important indoor air toxicants. Here, we further explore the issue of byproduct generation. Using the same UVPCO air cleaner, we conducted experiments to identify common VOCs {{that lead to the}} production of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde and to quantify their production rates. We sought to reduce the production of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde to acceptable levels by employing different chemisorbent scrubbers downstream of <b>the</b> UVPCO <b>device.</b> Additionally, we made preliminary measurements to estimate the capacity and expected lifetime of the chemisorbent media. For most experiments, the system was operated at 680 - 780 m{sup 3 }/h (400 - 460 cfm). A set of experiments was conducted with common VOCs <b>introduced</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> UVPCO <b>device</b> individually and in mixture. Compound conversion efficiencies and the production of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were determined by comparison of compound concentrations upstream and downstream of the reactor. There was general agreement between compound conversions efficiencies determined individually and in the mixture. This suggests that competition among compounds for active sites on the photocatalyst surface will not limit the performance of <b>the</b> UVPCO <b>device</b> when <b>the</b> total VOC concentration is low. A possible exception was the very volatile alcohols, for which there were some indications of competitive adsorption. The results also showed that formaldehyde was produced from many commonly encountered VOCs, while acetaldehyde was generated by specific VOCs, particularly ethanol. The implication is that formaldehyde concentrations are likely to increase when an effective UVPCO air cleaner is used in buildings containing typical VOC sources. The magnitude of the expected increase will depend upon a number of interrelated factors. Series of experiments were conducted to determine if the oxidizer, sodium permanganate (NaMnO{sub 4 }{center_dot}H{sub 2 }O), has sufficient reaction rates and capacity to counteract formaldehyde and acetaldehyde production and enable a 50 % reduction in building ventilation rate without net increases in indoor aldehyde concentrations. A commercially produced filter element and two laboratory-fabricated media beds containing NaMnO{sub 4 }{center_dot}H{sub 2 }O chemisorbent media were evaluated. The effectiveness of a device for removal of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and other VOCs was determined by measurement of concentrations immediately upstream and downstream of <b>the</b> <b>device.</b> In some experiments, conversion efficiencies and byproduct generation by <b>the</b> UVPCO <b>device</b> also were determined. Six experiments were conducted with the commercial filter element installed downstream of the UVPCO reactor. Eleven experiments were conducted with a single panel media bed (30 cm by 61 cm by 2. 5 cm deep) installed downstream of the UVPCO reactor; in these, the effects of temperature and air residence time on conversion efficiency were examined. Two experiments were conducted with a four-panel, folded, media bed (approximately four {{times the size of the}} single panel bed) installed downstream of the reactor. Because the commercial unit contained activated carbon as an additional component, it was effective at removing lower volatility compounds that typically have low oxidation rates in the UVPCO reactor. The filter element also met the minimum efficiency objective for formaldehyde. However, the removal of acetaldehyde was less than required. The air residence time in the single panel bed was not optimized as the removal efficiencies for both formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were strongly inversely related to the air flow rate through <b>the</b> <b>device.</b> In addition, <b>the</b> acetaldehyde removal efficiency decreased to less than 10 % with extended use of <b>the</b> <b>device.</b> <b>The</b> folded bed was considerably more effective; formaldehyde was removed with greater than 90 % efficiency, and acetaldehyde was removed at about 70 % efficiency. With the combined UVPCO/chemisorbent system, the net removal efficiencies for formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were 90 % and 40 %, respectively. In summary, the use of a multi-panel, folded scrubber filled with NaMnO{sub 4 }{center_dot}H{sub 2 }O chemisorbent media downstream of the prototype UVPCO air cleaner effectively counteracted the generation of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde due to incomplete oxidation of VOCs in the UVPCO reactor. Thus, this combined UVPCO air cleaner and chemisorbent system appears to have sufficient VOC removal efficiency to enable a 50 % reduction in ventilation rate without increasing indoor aldehyde concentrations...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{and demonstrates}} the utility and advantages of redox catalytic reactions and small scale synthetic applications. In particular electro-catalytic reactions are investigated along with electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL). ECL is used {{both as a}} probe for investigating the redox reactions and as an analytical method. The first chapter reviews the current techniques and achievements found {{in the area of}} dynamic electrochemistry and electrogenerated chemiluminescence and discusses occurrence, mechanism and potentially useful reactions worthy of further investigation for analytical applications. In Chapter 3 the electrocatalytic ECL reaction of Ru(bpy) 32 + with tertiary amines in particular with codeine as a model compound was investigated. The aim of the work was to develop a portable drug testing device, that gave good sensitivity and reproducibility. The Ru(bpy) 32 + was immobilized within the sol-gel matrix to develop a sensor which could be used directly for measuring tertiary amine containing drugs in buffer solution without the need to add reagents. A system of three electrodes was used in which Ru(bpy) 32 + was immobilised on to a glassy carbon working electrode. Initial work involved physical entrapment of the Ru(bpy) 32 + within the sol-gel matrix however, problems occurred with leaching of the reagent from this matrix. This problem was overcome by the covalent attachment of a novel Ru(bpy) 32 + derivative to the sol-gel matrix. Using this approach a calibration was obtained using ECL for the determination of codeine over the range 1 E- 3 to 1 E- 7 M in aqueous buffer with a limit of detection of 2. 65 E- 6 M for codeine. Covalent attachment, as compared to the physical entrapment of CL reagent, was advantageous as it ensured homogeneous distribution of the reagent within the matrix and prevented leaching. This reduced analysis costs, extended sensor lifetime and gave a reproducible analyte responses. This method was, however, only suitable for drugs that were soluble in aqueous solution and an alternative approach was needed for insoluble compounds. Chapter 4 describes an alternative approach for ECL reaction of tris(2, 2 ’-bipyridyl) ruthenium(II) with tertiary amine compounds. In this approach the electrode was modified using microdroplets of a highly hydrophobic tertiary amine (trioctyamine). As well as allowing for the analysis of compounds that were insoluble in aqueous solution, this setup allowed the investigation of the electron transfer reaction occurring on liquid|liquid interfaces. This mechanism was studied in fully protonated and deprotonated conditions. The extent of the electrochemiluminescence production was shown to be dependent on the degree of the interfacial protonation. Moreover, the data obtained enabled the estimation of the biphasic pKa, which was found to be approximately 10. 8. Furthermore, the mechanism was studied in fully deuterated and dedeuterated conditions, in order to investigate the effect of the deuterium on the biphasic pKa. Results suggest that the pKa increases to 13. 18 when deuterium is used instead of protons. In Chapter 5 a further electrocatalytic reaction was investigated. The reaction was that of vitamin B 12 a with trans 1, 2 -dibromocyclohexane (DBCH) in a homogeneous dimethylformamide media. The reaction was studied by cyclic voltammetry. Four peaks were seen due to the two chemically reversible redox (two electron process) couples for vitamin B 12 a/B 12 r (Co(III) /CO(II) L) and B 12 r/B 12 s (Co(II) L/Co(I)). When the bulk electrocatalytic reaction was tried in a “one pot” system, the reduction could not, however, be achieved; the cathodically synthesised Co(I) L was thought to be reoxidised at the anode. A “two pot” system did not have sufficient potential control and, therefore, chemical reduction was investigated instead. Four reducing agents (Na/amalgam, NaBH 4 /NaOH, DL-cysteine/alkali solution and Zn dust/NH 4 CL) were studied to reduce B 12 to B 12 s for a simple biphasic batch reaction of vitamin B 12 s with DBCH. The mild reducing agent Na/amalgam was not successful but the other three methods were shown to give 100 % yield if the reaction vials were rigorously shaken. This simple type of green, surfactant free reaction has not been previously reported. The reaction was then investigated in a microfluidic system. For this work the vitamin B 12 was reduced before being <b>introduced</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> microfluidic <b>device.</b> NaBH 4 /NaOH and DL-cysteine/alkali solution were selected as the most compatible reducing agents for <b>the</b> microfluidic <b>device.</b> Two types of microfluidic device were employed, one with a T-shape channel, and one with a serpentine channel. The conversions obtained with <b>the</b> microfluidic <b>device</b> were much lower (approximately 10 %) than for the simple batch reactions (100 %). The yield increased as the flow rate decreased, and the residence time increased. Using the serpentine channel made no noticeable difference to the conversion rate. Problems were also seen due to the use of excess reducing agent prior to introduction of the reduced vitamin B 12 <b>into</b> <b>the</b> microfluidic <b>device,</b> as this could cause blockages and bubbles. The main problem was, however, the lack of mixing in <b>the</b> <b>device.</b> One way to overcome this would be to use an ultrasonic transducer with <b>the</b> microfluidic <b>device</b> but although preliminary experiments were carried out, there was not time to fully investigate this approach.
