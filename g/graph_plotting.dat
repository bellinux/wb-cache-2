50|$|PFK1 is an {{allosteric}} enzyme whose activity {{can be described}} using the symmetry model of allosterism whereby there is a concerted transition from an enzymatically inactive T-state to the active R-state. F6P binds with a high affinity to the R state but not the T state enzyme. For every molecule of F6P that binds to PFK1, the enzyme progressively shifts from T state to the R state. Thus a <b>graph</b> <b>plotting</b> PFK1 activity against increasing F6P concentrations would adopt the sigmoidal curve shape traditionally associated with {{allosteric enzyme}}s.|$|E

5000|$|Electrical {{impedance}} {{of muscle}} tissue is anisotropic; current flowing parallel to muscle fibers flows differently from current flowing orthogonally across the fibers. [...] Current flowing orthogonally across a muscle encounters more cell membranes, thus increasing resistance, reactance, and phase values. By taking measurements at different angles {{with respect to}} muscle fibers, EIM {{can be used to}} determine the anisotropy of a given muscle. Anisotropy tends to be shown either as a <b>graph</b> <b>plotting</b> resistance, reactance, or phase as a function of angle with respect to the direction of muscle fibers or as a ratio of transverse (perpendicular to fibers) measurement to longitudinal measurement (parallel to muscle fibers) of a given impedance factor.|$|E

In UDT the transfer times is high, {{when compared to other}} protocols, such as TCP and UDP. The variation is because UDT employs better flow control and congestion control mechanism than other protocols. Flow control plays a vital role in high transfer rates, because, receiver buffer at the network line card is frequently overrun and sometimes not scheduled for transferring data.|$|R

50|$|In {{numerical}} analysis, adaptive mesh refinement, or AMR, is {{a method}} of adapting the accuracy of a solution within certain sensitive or turbulent regions of simulation, dynamically and during the time the solution is being calculated. When solutions are calculated numerically, they are often limited to pre-determined quantified grids as in the Cartesian plane which constitute the computational grid, or 'mesh'. Many problems in numerical analysis, however, do not require a uniform precision in the numerical grids used for <b>graph</b> <b>plotting</b> or computational simulation, and would be better suited if specific areas of graphs which needed precision could be refined in quantification only in the regions requiring the added precision. Adaptive mesh refinement provides such a dynamic programming environment for adapting the precision of the numerical computation based on the requirements of a computation problem in specific areas of multi-dimensional graphs which need precision while leaving the {{other regions of the}} multi-dimensional graphs at lower levels of precision and resolution.|$|E
