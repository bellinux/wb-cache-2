In these locations, all the analysed parameters (temperature, pH, salinity, conductivity, turbidity, suspended matter, organic matter, phosphates, sulphates, nitrates, chloride, calcium, magnesium, iron and nitrogen) were the highest, except for chlorides. Total mesophile aerobic flora varied between 1. 4 ± 0. 50 × 105 in Tibati and 5. 57 ± 0. 50 × 106 CFU/mL in Lagdo. Salmonella concentration was comprised between 66. 66 ± 1. 62 in Tibati and 274 ± 3. 16 CFU/mL in Yagoua. There was about 10 ± 0. 50 CFU/mL Vibrio in Lagdo and 342. 27 ± 5. 53 CFU/mL in Maga.

40|$|Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a multisystem illness, {{which may}} be {{associated}} with imbalances in gut microbiota. This study builds on recent evidence that sleep may be influenced by gut microbiota, by assessing whether changes to microbiota in a clinical population known to have both poor sleep and high rates of colonization with gram-positive <b>faecal</b> <b>Streptococcus,</b> can improve sleep. Twenty-one CFS participants completed a 22 - day open label trial. Faecal microbiota analysis was performed at baseline {{and at the end of}} the trial. Participants were administered erythromycin 400 mg b. d. for 6 days. Actigraphy and questionnaires were used to monitor sleep, symptoms and mood. Changes in patients who showed a clinically significant change in <b>faecal</b> <b>Streptococcus</b> after treatment (responders; defined as post-therapy distribution&lt; 6 %) were compared to participants who did not respond to treatment. In the seven responders, there was a significant increase in actigraphic total sleep time (p= 0. 028) from baseline to follow up, compared with non-responders. Improved vigour scores were associated with a lower Streptococcus count (ρ=- 0. 90, p= 0. 037). For both the responders and the whole group, poorer mood was associated with higher Lactobacillus. Short term antibiotic treatment appears to be insufficient to effect sustainable changes in the gut ecosystem in most CFS participants. Some improvement in objective sleep parameters and mood were found in participants with reduced levels of gram-positive gut microbiota after antibiotic treatment, which is encouraging. Further study of possible links between gut microorganisms and sleep and mood disturbances is warranted...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MSc (Environmental Sciences)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. Water {{resources}} in the North West Province are characterised by an overall scarcity due to non–perennial rivers being the dominating water sources. However, increases in water demand from all social, environmental and economic entities {{have resulted in the}} inevitable deterioration of surface waters resulting in increasing threats of faecal and chemical pollution. The quality of 5 surface water systems in the North West Province was assessed by monitoring the physico–chemical properties of the water as well as the levels and diversity of <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci.</b> The Mooi, Harts, Schoonspruit and Vaal Rivers were sampled during one warm–rainy season in 2010 and one cold–dry season in 2011. Dissimilarly, the opposite was employed for Barberspan as it was sampled during one cold–dry season in 2010 and one warm–rainy season in 2011. The average physico–chemical and microbial levels measured at some sites during both seasons were elevated and exceeded the acceptable South African Target Water Quality Range (TWQR) for full and intermediate recreational contact, livestock watering and irrigation. Seasonal variation patterns were observed in both physico–chemical and microbial levels. All surface water systems had relatively lower pH and electrical conductivity levels during the warm–rainy season as compared to the cold–dry season. In addition, water samples collected during the warm–rainy season from the Harts River, Barberspan and Vaal River had higher bacterial levels (total coliforms, faecal coliforms, E. coli and <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci)</b> compared to samples collected during the cold–dry season. The Schoonspruit River had higher bacterial levels during the cold–dry season compared to the warm–rainy season. A total of 80 and 59 presumptive <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> isolates were obtained in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Biochemical tests and 16 S rRNA gene sequencing were used to identify all <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> isolates. A total of 6 <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> species were identified and these included: Enterococcus faecium, E. faecalis, E. mundtii, E. casseliflavus, E. gallinarum and E hirae. Haemolysis and antibiotic resistant iii patterns were used for the characterisation of all <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> isolates. Of the 80 and 59 <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> isolates obtained, 32. 5 % and 6. 8 % displayed ?–haemolysis. Furthermore, dominant multiple antibiotic resistance patterns were observed for <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> isolates at most sites in both years. <b>Faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> isolates obtained in 2010 were resistant to Penicillin G (10 ?g), Neomycin (30 ?g) and Vancomycin (30 ?g) and susceptible to Amoxicillin (10 ?g) and Streptomycin (300 ?g). Isolates obtained in 2011 were also resistant to Penicillin G (10 ?g) and Neomycin (30 ?g) but also to Amoxicillin (10 ?g) and Ciprofloxacin (5 ?g). Furthermore, the 2011 isolates were susceptible to Chloramphenicol (30 ?g) and Trimethoprim (2. 5 ?g). The physico–chemical and microbial levels measured at several sites exceeded acceptable limits and proved unsuitable for applications such as full and intermediate recreational activities, livestock watering as well as irrigation. In addition, it appears that the physico–chemical and microbial levels were influenced by the season of collection. The multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) phenotype data of <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> isolates obtained for the different sites suggests that their exposure history to several antibiotics was similar. This is most probably due to a uniform pollution pattern along the system. The presence and isolation of <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci,</b> particularly those capable of causing ?–haemolysis, in surface water systems used for livestock watering and cultural activities is an important health care concern. The significance is outlined when the serious nature of the diseases and infections that could be caused by some of the pathogens (E. faecalis and E. faecium) isolated in this study as well as their emerging antimicrobial resistances is considered.

40|$|Diarrhoeal {{disease is}} one of the leading causes of {{morbidity}} and mortality in less developed countries, especially among children aged 0 - 5 years. It is a symptom of infection caused by a host of bacterial, viral and parasitic organisms most of which can be spread by contaminated water. Diarrhoea prevalence rate for the children in Dhaka slums is 214. 29. The total costs of children’s diarrhoea (adding all the direct and indirect) in Dhaka slums is Tk. 133. 88 over a 15 day time interval. The water quality is measured at the point-of-use and the point-of-source by the total coliform, faecal coliform, and <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> tests per 100 ml water. The total coliform, faecal coliform, and <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> are at the point-of-source 651, 450, and 71 and at the point-of-use 919, 636, and 80 respectively.

The sanitary conditions on the slaughter slabs and within the abattoir grounds was also assessed to determine the effect on the water quality of the wells used in dressing carcasses and other activities. All the wells sampled were clear and without colour, odour and taste with PH and temperature values ranging between 6. 41 – 6. 75 and 24. 5 oc – 28. 4 oc respectively.

40|$|Thesis (M. Dip.) [...] Cape Technikon, 1990 The die-off in {{the marine}} {{environment}} of micro-organisms that are present in sewage was investigated. A literature survey was carried out and studies were done in the laboratory, at an offshore outfall and at a surf-zone outfall. In the laboratory raw sewage was mixed with sea water at known dilutions and the die-off of faecal coliforms, <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> and coliphage was monitored. At the offshore sewage outfall a tracer, Rhodamine B. was released in the pump station {{and the distribution of}} the plume around the diffuser was determined by means of the Rhodamine B concentrations and faecal colifonns counts. At the factory surf-zone outlet the Rhodamine B was injected into the pipeline. Samples were taken at 50 and 100 meter distance from the outlet. Thedie-off of faecal colifonns, <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> and coliphage was monitored. The following results were obtained: Literature study: (i) Coliforms • Temperatures of 15 QC and lower are conducive to survival while nutrients, at a concentration as low as 2, 5 mg/L organic carbon, stimulate growth. A rise in salinity has a negative effect on the organisms. • The T 90 value in direct sunlight is 35 days). Changes in weather• conditions, sunlight intensity, hours of sunlight, depth and turbidity of seawater and different seasons are the most important factors accounting for the variations in the T 90 values. • It is, therefore, important for the initial dilution to be large enough. This will ensure that the bacterial counts conform to the water quality criteria, as the die-off rates {{in the marine}} environment are slow and not always adequate, except around mid day. • Faecal coliforms as a single parameter is not considered to be the best indicator of marine pollution. • The 1 : 4 ratio between faecal coliforms and <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> for human faeces and 1 : 0, 7 ratio for animal waste are not applicable in the marine environment. The survival of <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> in seawater is better than that of faecal coliforms and the ratio therefore changes. (ii) Enterococci and pathogens • The T 90 value for <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> is double that of coliforms and also varies in the dark. In direct sunlight any change in sunlight intensity, change the T 90 values. • In general the numbers of <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> and pathogens occuring in sewage are smaller than those of coliforms, but their survival time is longer. This could lead to a situation where the water quality complies with the criteria according to the coliform counts, while a health risk may exist due to th survival of pathogens...|$|E

40|$|Infection with a <b>faecal</b> <b>Streptococcus</b> species {{belonging}} to Lancefield group D {{has been a}} major cause of mortalities on certain trout farms on the escarpment of the Mpumalanga Province in the Republic of South Africa. Evidence is given of a connection between subclinical gas bubble disease and infection with this organism in rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. The condition causes serious losses during the summer months when water temperatures rise above 18 °C. The larger table-size fish are affected first and present with exophthalmos before developing signs of a typical bacterial septicaemia. The design of the water supply to the fish ponds on these farms allowed supersaturation of the water with atmospheric gas. Vortex formation at water extraction points appears to have been the main cause of air entrainment into the water supply leading to the ponds. By correcting the faults responsible for the development of hyperbaric gas pressure in the water, it was possible to control this disease on two badly affected farms. The overlapping similarities in the clinical signs and pathology of gas bubble disease and that seen in fish suffering from Streptococcus D infection are discussed, as well as the diagnostically significant changes in the gill tissues that are specific to subclinical exposure to gas supersaturation in the water.

The description of a microbiological community of drinking water distribution systems is intended for a safe and proper use of drinking water. These studies were aimed at characterising the microbial condition of the drinking water supply system in Lithuania by means of culture-based methods and biochemical techniques. Samples of drinking water (in cities supplied in centralised way from taps, wells, and boreholes) were collected in different locations in Lithuania. Seeking to grow microflora present in water the membrane filtration method was applied to study the samples. Most often water samples were studied to identify coliform bacteria (Citrobacter spp., En-terobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp.), Escherichia coli (or faecal coliform), Enterococci (or fecal Strepto-coccus), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (other non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria) according to the international ISO standards. Large amounts of non-fermenting gram-negative bacteria were found in centralised urban water.

The effect is highly significant for TBC, <b>faecal</b> <b>Streptococci</b> (P< 0. 01) and significant only for Yeasts (P< 0. 05). No effect was observed for other microbiological variables. The variability of the chemical composition is significant for density and protein (P< 0. 05), highly for pH, Dornic acidity, freezing point and solids-non-fat (P< 0. 01). Lactose, fat and total solids are independent. The semi-arid zone contains milks with a high density, weak freezing point and less loaded on TBC, TC, FC and Moulds.

The samples collected from different sites of the lagoon showed wide variations in the counts of bacteria. The Bacterial population varied with seasonal variations in the water body. The Faecal coliform counts are increased during the summer months and lowered during the winter ones. The opposite happens of streptococci bacteria that are increased during the winter months and lowered during the summer ones depending on rainfall. Positive correlation was established between <b>faecal</b> coliform and <b>streptococci</b> bacteria. The results of bacteriological analysis of water revealed that the situation is alarming. The Bacteriological analysis of lagoon water indicated that water was polluted by faecal contaminants to the extent that it was unsuitable from the recreation point of view and hence needed thorough impoundment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{survey was}} carried out to {{determine}} the prevalence of vulvovaginitis in goats in Ibadan. Vaginal and vulvular swabs were then collected {{from some of the}} does with or without clinical signs at different locations in Ibadan. The samples were immediately taken to the microbiological laboratory for isolation and identification of the bacteria agents. The result showed that the prevalence of vulvovaginitis in goats in Ibadan was very high, 43. 48 % (50) does were affected with vulvovaginitis (inflamed vagina and vulva with or without discharges), while 56. 52 % (65) does were not affected. The bacteria that were isolated and identified from the samples from affected does were coagulase positive and negative Staphylococcus, beta haemolytic Streptococcus, Gemella species, E. coli, Proteus mirabilis while from the unaffected does only coagulase positive Staphylococcus and <b>faecal</b> type <b>Streptococcus</b> with lower populations were isolated and identified. Antibiotic sensitivity test revealed that these bacteria were sensitive to Cotrimoxazole, Ciprofloxacin, Vancomycin, Nalidixic acid. Veterinarians are therefore advised that for effective treatment of vulvovaginitis in goats antibiotic sensitivity test is necessary...|$|R
40|$|The {{assessment}} of phreatic groundwater quality and surface water quality {{was carried out}} within Rauccio Park area {{in order to identify}} the possible risk factors for human health related to the use of waters for domestic, irrigation and recreational purpose. The samples were collected during the period March-November 2002. Phreatic layer was seasonally monitored through eighteen wells while surface waters was monthly examined through nine sampling points. Each sample was submitted, according to the standard methodologies, to the search of total and <b>faecal</b> coliform, <b>streptococci</b> and Salmonella spp. The results obtained during this work highlight a situation of degradation of the environment, and also for the hygienic point of view, so to considerably reduce the potential use of the basin waters. The space and the time trend of the microbiological variables have highlighted a diffuse faecal origin contamination whose dynamic is bound to the antrophic load and to the atmospheric rainfall. Therefore, it is hoped for the prompt accomplishment of a series of interventions aimed to limit the release of pollutants...|$|R
40|$|Intertidal {{sediment}} {{samples from}} three EU recognised bathing waters in Morecambe Bay, Lancashire, U. K. (Morecambe North, Morecambe South and Heysham) were analysed for thermophilic campylobacters, salmonellae, faecal coliforms and <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> over a 12 -month period. Campylobacters show a strong seasonality. They are generally absent {{in the summer}} months but are consistently present in the winter. The main Campylobacter species isolated were C. lari and urease-positive thermophilic campylobacters (UPTC), {{both of which are}} associated with avian hosts. C. jejuni and C. coli and Salmonella were not isolated from the sediments. Faecal coliforms and <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> were isolated throughout the year with no obvious seasonal trends in their numbers. Higher numbers were found at Morecambe North and South than at Heysham. There was no discernible relationship between the numbers of campylobacters and faecal indicators. Faecal indicators were found predominantly in the surface layers of the sediments and declined in number with depth. Campylobacters were restricted to the surface layer. Experimental results for the in situ deposition of bacteria onto clean, sterile surfaces from the water column during tidal cover showed deposition rates equivalent to approximately 0. 1 % of the total population of faecal coliforms, 0. 01 % of the <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> and 1 % of the campylobacters in the sediments. These rates of accretion were not high enough to be detected during routine sampling carried out before and after high water, using standard methods. The results show that the sediments act as a reservoir for bacteria, especially the faecal indicators. In rough weather resuspension can contribute significantly to bacterial numbers in the surface waters...|$|E
30|$|Similar to our results, high {{efficiencies}} of coliform elimination {{have reported}} by some authors. Pereira-Neto et al. (1986) have studied pathogen inactivation in four compost piles, employing the aerated static pile system. They have evaluated pathogen inactivation {{by means of}} the commonly used indicator organisms. E. coli and <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> reduced from approximately 107  org/g ww to less than 102 org/g ww with a removal percentage of 100 similar to our results. Similarly, during open-air windrow composting of beef feedlot manure, Larney et al. (2003) have reported that more than 99.9  % of total coliform and E. coli was eliminated in the first 7  days. In the study of Banegas et al. (2007), during the composting process, Salmonella, faecal coliforms (E. coli), and <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> were determined in samples taken after 1, 30, 60 and 90  days of composting. Similar to our results, they have reported that at the high temperatures (between 57 and 61  °C) reached during composting most pathogens were destroyed, making resulting composts safer for agricultural use.|$|E
40|$|Background: Urban {{water sources}} of Khamis Mushait Governorate, southwestern Saudi Arabia, were studied {{to assess their}} {{bacteriological}} characteristics and suitability for potable purposes. A cross-sectional epidemiological method was adopted to investigate the four main urban water sources (i. e. bottled, desalinated, surface, and well water). These were sampled and examined between February and June 2007. Results: A total of 95 water samples from bottled, desalinated, surface, and well water were collected randomly from the study area using different gathering and analysing techniques. The bacteriological examination of water samples included the most probable number of presumptive coliforms, faecal coliforms, and <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> (MPN/ 100 ml). The {{results showed that the}} total coliform count (MPN/ 100 ml) was not detected in any samples taken from bottled water, while it was detected in those taken from desalinated, surface, and well water: percentages were 12. 9, 80. 0, and 100. 0, respectively. Faecal coliforms were detected in desalinated, surface, and well water, with percentages of 3. 23, 60. 0 and 87. 88, respectively. About 6. 45 % of desalinated water, 53. 33 % of surface water, and 57. 58 % of well water was found positive for <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci.</b> Colonies o...|$|E

40|$|Increasing water {{shortage}} hast to be anticipated worldwide. Therefore since {{many years now}} so called "Alternative Sanitation Systems", which bases on {{the aims of the}} recycling management, are examined. Main features of these approaches are the separation of domestic waste water flows according to their characteristics into the grey water, the brown water or the yellow water fraction. Thus, the partial flows can be treated appropriately and the reuse of nutrients contained in the partial flows (e. g. nitrogen, phosphors or potassium) and the water itself is possible. In consideration with these aspects, within the research project KOMPLETT (2005 - 2009) purification schemes for separated grey and black water (brown and yellow water) were carried out and tested at different scales. Besides biological treatment using membrane bioreactor technology (MBR) the developed process comprises components for physical-chemical degradation and removal of organic compounds, disinfection and elimination of trace elements. The results of the investigations show, that the developed process scheme produces very high effluent qualities for purified grey and black water. In particular for grey water the produced water quality meets highest requirements for utilization, e. g. drinking water standards. Within the blackwater process the purified water can be reused for toilet flushing without any restriction. Relevant hygienic-microbiological organisms, as well as organic compounds were eliminated certainly in the black water treatment process. E. g. E. coli and <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococcus</b> were not detectable in 100 mL after the MBR. Hence, with the selected process technology domestic water cycle for separated grey and blackwater can be closed. The KOMPLETT water recycling technology is designed as a decentralized system. Therefore stable system operation is of highest importance. In particular as the purification scheme bases on biological treatment process. Therefore a special feature of the project was the development and integration of new and innovative sanitary products, involving antimicrobial surfaces and water saving flushing toilets (3. 5 L per flush) in order to reduce impacts of detergents and disinfectants on the biological treatment. Within the project antimicrobial surfaces based on silver ions as well as self-purifying surfaces using the photo-catalytic effect of titanium dioxide (TiO 2) were developed and tested in laboratory {{as well as in the}} final pilot phase. There the treatment technology and sanitary products were coupled and water cycles were closed. Furthermore in this part of the project the consumers' acceptance among the new sanitary products using nanotechnology was ascertained. It could be shown, that the examined sliver-doped and photo-catalytic surfaces can inhibit or rather minimize microbiological growth. In comparison to the undoped surfaces a reduction of > 1 to 3 log 10 levels according to the selected test organisms E. coli and S. aureus were detected. Accordingly, contaminations of black water by microorganisms could be reduced significantly at source. As a consequence the application of disinfectant and detergents could be minimized. Therefore, influences on biological treatment process through detergents used for toilet cleaning are reduced to a necessary minimum and no operational problems encountered throughout the study...|$|R
