25|$|There is no <b>definitive</b> <b>test</b> for the {{poisoning}} however, since megalocytosis is not {{a change}} in the liver which is specific to ragwort poisoning. It is also seen in poisoning by other alkylating agents, such as nitrosamines and aflatoxins. Aflatoxins are a common contaminant formed in feedstuffs by moulds. Research in the United Kingdom has produced results showing megalocytosis, which may be due to various causes, to be a relatively uncommon cause of liver disease in horses.|$|E
25|$|There is no <b>definitive</b> <b>test</b> for OI. The {{diagnosis}} is usually {{suggested by the}} occurrence of bone fractures with little trauma {{and the presence of}} other clinical features. A skin biopsy can be performed to determine the structure and quantity of type I collagen. DNA testing can confirm the diagnosis, however, it cannot exclude it because not all mutations causing OI are known and/or tested for. OI type II is often diagnosed by ultrasound during pregnancy, where already multiple fractures and other characteristic features may be present. Relative to control, OI cortical bone shows increased porosity, canal diameter, and connectivity in micro-computed tomography.|$|E
25|$|Polysomnography is {{performed}} in a sleep laboratory while the patient sleeps, preferably {{at his or her}} usual sleeping time. The polysomnogram (PSG) objectively records sleep stages and respiratory events. It shows multiple channels of electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG), electrocardiogram (ECG), nasal and oral airflow, abdominal, chest and leg movements and blood oxygen levels. A single part of a polysomnogram is sometimes measured at home with portable equipment, for example oximetry, which records blood oxygen levels throughout the night. Polysomnography is not routinely used in the evaluation of patients with insomnia or circadian rhythm disorders, except as needed to rule out other disorders. It will usually be a <b>definitive</b> <b>test</b> for sleep apnea.|$|E

An elevated inhibin A (along with an increased beta-hCG, decreased AFP, and a decreased estriol) is suggestive of the presence of a fetus with Down syndrome. As a screening test, abnormal quad screen test results need to be followed up with more <b>definitive</b> <b>tests.</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective: Comparative {{evaluation}} of the auxiliary laboratory tests used for quick and correct diagnosis with urine culture results in children with suspected urinary system infection was investigated. Material and Methods: A prospective screening study was held on 239 patients {{between the ages of}} 9 months and 14 years, who referred to the outpatient clinic of child health and disease, with suspected urinary tract infection. Complete urine tests, urine cultures, whole blood counts, and tests for urea, creatinine, and C-reactive protein levels were performed in all patients. Results: As urine culture is the gold standard in diagnosis of urinary system infections, <b>definitive</b> <b>tests</b> were compared between groups with or without growth. According to this, while CRP did not differ significantly between groups (p> 0, 05), leukocyte counts, leukocyturia levels, and leukocyte esterase positivity was significantly higher in the group with positive culture growth (p> 0, 05). Conclusion: It was concluded that leukocyte esterase was the most sensitive test, while microscopic leukocyturia was the most specific <b>test</b> among the <b>definitive</b> <b>tests</b> in the diagnosis of urinary tract infection, compared with culture results...|$|R

50|$|There is no <b>definitive</b> <b>test</b> to {{diagnose}} psoriatic arthritis. Symptoms of psoriatic arthritis may closely resemble other diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis.

40|$|Frequent action {{video game}} players often {{outperform}} non-gamers {{on measures of}} perception and cognition, and some studies find that video game practice enhances those abilities. The possibility that video game training transfers broadly to other aspects of cognition is exciting because training on one task rarely improves performance on others. At first glance, the cumulative evidence suggests a strong relationship between gaming experience and other cognitive abilities, but methodological shortcomings call that conclusion into question. We discuss these pitfalls, identify how existing studies succeed or fail in overcoming them, and provide guidelines for more <b>definitive</b> <b>tests</b> {{of the effects of}} gaming on cognition...|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss the}} Jaynes-Cummings model in {{different}} {{representations of the}} algebra of canonical commutation relations.

However, the reducible representation recently introduced as a candidate for `QED without infinities' leads to new effects. We analyze from this perspective the experiments on Rabi oscillations performed by the Kastler-Brossel Laboratory group from Paris. Surprisingly, the results seem to support the reducible representation approach. We also discuss possibilities of more <b>definitive</b> <b>tests</b> of the new formalism.
