25|$|The {{engineering}} {{problems associated}} with leaving Earth and developing space propulsion systems have been examined for over a century, and millions of man-hours of research have been spent on them. In recent {{years there has been}} an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>research</b> on the issue of how humans can survive and work in space for extended and possibly indefinite periods of time. This question requires input from the physical and biological sciences and has now become the greatest challenge (other than funding) facing human space exploration. A fundamental step in overcoming this challenge is trying to understand the effects and impact of long-term space travel on the human body.|$|E
25|$|Though {{statistics}} {{regarding the}} magnitude of child trafficking are difficult to obtain, the International Labour Organization estimates that 1.2 million children are trafficked each year. The trafficking of children has been internationally recognized as a serious crime that exists in every {{region of the world}} and which often has human rights implications. Yet, it is only within the past decade that the prevalence and ramifications of this practice have risen to international prominence, due to a dramatic <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>research</b> and public action. A variety of potential solutions have accordingly been suggested and implemented, which can be categorized as four types of action: broad protection, prevention, law enforcement, and victim assistance.|$|E

We also provide evidence to show that an unexpected <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> R&D expendi-ture is an investment decision which is again only beneficial for firms whose CEOs do not exhibit overconfidence. Our findings, which may be attributable to both overinvestment and the overestimation of future cash flows, indicate that overconfident behavior often leads to the pursuit of value-destroying R&D investment projects...|$|R
