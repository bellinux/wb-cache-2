5|$|A writer {{tends to}} find <b>her</b> <b>characters</b> in her self, so I can tell you... that Nixon, Pat, Mme. Mao, Kissinger and the chorus were all 'me.' And the inner lives of Mao and Chou En-Lai, who I couldn't find in myself at all, {{were drawn from}} a couple of close acquaintances.|$|E
5|$|Ng's main {{characters}} are generally female. These characters {{generally do not}} hold the same employment; some occupations held by <b>her</b> <b>characters</b> include office worker, animal nursery employee, and automotive repair shop owner. Her children's stories are written simply, illustrated, and deal with children's feelings; {{they are intended to}} give children more empathy. The characters' names are chosen to be easy to remember.|$|E
50|$|Goodyear {{has stated}} on {{different}} occasions {{that she would}} research the typical salary <b>her</b> <b>character</b> would be on for her barmaid job, as she wanted <b>her</b> <b>character</b> only to appear in outfits that she could realistically afford. This was to make <b>her</b> <b>character</b> credible and believable. This was where the leopard skin style of clothing came from because it was considered naughty, racy and very sexy in <b>her</b> <b>character's</b> early days and was deemed very affordable, staying true to <b>her</b> <b>character.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Her</b> <b>character</b> is also {{featured}} in {{various types of}} merchandising such as figurines from KOF: Maximum Impact and SNK Beach Volley. Athena was {{also featured}} along with Mai Shiranui {{as a part of}} a set of two action-figures with both <b>her</b> <b>character</b> being chibi. A key-chain from <b>her</b> <b>character</b> was also released by SNK. Athena was the featured character on a 'Neoprint' photo printing machine for a while.|$|R

5|$|Dragon Quest II is a {{role-playing}} video game. It {{allows the}} player to control {{more than one}} character, each of whom has their own characteristics, {{and it is the}} first game in the Dragon Quest series to do so. The game introduced a party system where, instead of beginning the game with an entire party as was common in previous computer RPGs, the player begins the game with only one character and gradually recruits more party members {{during the course of the}} game. The player controls his or <b>her</b> <b>characters</b> as they move in the game world. They can search treasure chests, talk and trade with villagers, equip themselves with weapons and armor, and cast spells.|$|E
5|$|Heyer's {{earliest}} {{works were}} romance novels, most set before 1800. In 1935, she released Regency Buck, {{her first novel}} set in the Regency period. This bestselling novel essentially established the genre of Regency romance. Unlike other romance novels of the period, Heyer's novels used the setting as a plot device. Many of <b>her</b> <b>characters</b> exhibited modern-day sensibilities; more conventional characters in the novels would point out the heroine's eccentricities, such as wanting to marry for love. The books were set almost entirely {{in the world of}} the wealthy upper class and only occasionally mention poverty, religion, or politics.|$|E
50|$|Dorothy McGuire insisted <b>her</b> <b>character</b> show <b>her</b> plainness with no makeup, ill-fitting {{clothes and}} a drab hairstyle. When McGuire was filmed looking {{appealing}} to Robert Young, <b>her</b> <b>character</b> had similar costumes that were well tailored.|$|R
2500|$|Susan Sarandon as Grandma Lynn, Susie's grandmother. Sarandon {{stated that}} <b>her</b> <b>character</b> {{is like a}} [...] "comic relief" [...] and that <b>her</b> <b>character</b> deals with the pain of Susie's death by drinking, smoking and {{shooting}} guns.|$|R
500|$|Stone {{described}} <b>her</b> <b>character</b> as [...] "a daddy's girl" [...] {{who is very}} {{responsible and}} protective of her family and loves science. She said of <b>her</b> <b>character,</b> [...] "she offers Parker a world of stability, of a family unit not marred with parental loss and, beyond physical allure, the two forge an intellectual connection over their shared love of science." [...] <b>Her</b> <b>character,</b> she explained, [...] "is stuck between [...] the Captain and Peter Parker and Spider-Man, who have different ways about going about finding justice in their lives" [...] which she felt was a fun thing to explore. Dana Stevens of Slate described <b>her</b> <b>character</b> ...|$|R
5|$|Shimura mainly {{found her}} characters' names by looking through name dictionaries, {{although}} she also took {{the names of}} acquaintances and slightly changed them, and even used train station names for side characters appearing only once. Out of all the characters, Shimura is most pleased with Kanako Sasa. For the designs of clothes for the female characters, Shimura consulted various fashion magazines for girls in their early teens, especially Nicola. Shimura commented self-deprecatingly in the afterword of volume one that, like her other series, <b>her</b> <b>characters</b> do not look very different from each other, her panels are too white, and there is much pathos.|$|E
5|$|The manga {{has become}} one of Shueisha's bestsellers, with over 22.5 million copies sold. In Japan and North America, several {{individual}} volumes have appeared in weekly top-ten lists of bestselling manga. Although most reviewers found it similar to other series for the same demographic, they compared its moments of originality and well-developed characters favorably to other shōnen series. Hoshino's artwork has received mixed reviews; critics commented that <b>her</b> <b>characters</b> are visually appealing, but her fight sequences are difficult to follow.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} book displays Potter's willingness {{to exploit the}} commercial possibilities of <b>her</b> <b>characters</b> and tales. The purchaser was alerted {{to the existence of}} other Potter books on the inside front cover and directed to a list of books on the back cover. Other merchandise included sets of linen or silk placemats painted by Potter for friends with an abridged text and 12 of the illustrations. In 1910, Potter patented a design for a soft toy duck based on her model of Jemima in a Paisley handkerchief shawl and bonnet. A soft Jemima doll was manufactured by J. I. Farnell of Acton.|$|E
5000|$|Julieta Ortega {{described}} <b>her</b> <b>character</b> as a {{girl that}} refuses responsibilities, stable relations or {{trying to build a}} family, preferring instead to stay with her friends. Ortega does not feel identified with those attitudes of <b>her</b> <b>character.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Hella's monster {{character}} in Lordi {{is a mix}} of human and doll, Scarbie. She has created <b>her</b> <b>character</b> along with the costume-maker Mr. Lordi. <b>Her</b> <b>character</b> has been described as [...] "Living Doll", [...] "Burned´n´Buried" [...] and [...] "Plastic Chick".|$|R
5000|$|Dodd has {{commented that}} she liked the fact <b>her</b> <b>character</b> looked a little bit {{different}} to everyone else on the show. She also stated that <b>her</b> <b>character</b> always seems to be there for everyone, somewhat of an agony aunt. The character had plenty of self-image issues. Dodd also states numerous times that she is known as [...] "the fat girl from Hollyoaks". <b>Her</b> <b>character</b> has also been described as 'breaking the mould' as the first plus-size character to feature in the series. In 2009, five years after the character had left the series, a BBC health organisation slammed Dodd for using <b>her</b> <b>character</b> as a role model in making overweight viewers think it's okay to be overweight.|$|R
5|$|She uses unnamed famous scientists, Aleister Crowley and Yūsuke Santamaria {{as models}} for several of <b>her</b> <b>characters.</b> Characters are also based on her editor and the Tim Campi Design silver {{accessory}} brand. Hoshino collaborated with Kata Kizaki, {{the author of the}} novel adaptations, to create the character Bak Chan. The role of Miranda Lotto changed, and was ultimately lengthened, after Hoshino realized the similarities the two shared. Hoshino comically comments that Allen's hair has become very similar to the Super Saiyan, a transformation from Dragon Ball, in which the character's hair becomes spiky. Towards the beginning of D.Gray-mans publication, Hoshino stated that Allen, Kanda, and Cross Marian are the hardest characters to draw while the Millennium Earl and Hevlaska are the easiest.|$|E
25|$|Critics have {{interpreted}} various Moomin characters as being inspired by real people, especially {{members of the}} author's family, and Jansson spoke in interviews about the backgrounds of, and possible models for, <b>her</b> <b>characters.</b>|$|E
25|$|Gambito {{is known}} for playing many {{characters}} within her videos. <b>Her</b> <b>characters</b> are easily recognized in her videos for their hair, attire, and personality. When portraying a character, Gambito uses wigs and notable accessories to differentiate each character when necessary.|$|E
5000|$|Viudas e hijos del Rock and Roll is {{the first}} work of Paola Barrientos as a lead actress in television. She had a long career in theater plays, and <b>her</b> <b>character</b> in Graduados {{got a lot of}} praise. Still, she {{clarified}} that both <b>characters</b> are different: <b>her</b> <b>character</b> in Graduados was formal, and <b>her</b> <b>character</b> in [...] "Viudas..." [...] is a rebel rocker. She accepted to work in the telenovela because she had a good relation with the other actors of the cast.|$|R
50|$|In early 2006, she was {{released}} from her contract on The Young and the Restless, though <b>her</b> <b>character</b> was still mentioned, from time to time. When <b>her</b> <b>character</b> returned to The Young and the Restless later that year, however, she was not played by Brown.|$|R
50|$|Tara Mae Thornton is a twenty-something Louisiana {{native and}} lifelong {{friend of the}} main protagonist, Sookie Stackhouse. Compiling a {{description}} of <b>her</b> <b>character</b> is a complex task because quite a few facts about her changed when <b>her</b> <b>character</b> was brought from page to screen.|$|R
25|$|According to an April 2004 {{article in}} The New Yorker, Charles Wallace {{is thought to}} be partly based on Madeleine L'Engle's son, the late Bion Franklin. L'Engle herself {{acknowledged}} that Bion was the model for another of <b>her</b> <b>characters,</b> Rob Austin, but never stated a similar provenance for Charles Wallace.|$|E
25|$|This {{season was}} slated {{to see the}} {{introductions}} of villains Granny Goodness, Desaad, and Glorious Godfrey. Lindsay Hartley was cast as another of Darkseid's minions, Mad Harriet, who works for Granny Goodness. Hartley explained the traditional claws <b>her</b> <b>characters</b> wears are powered by kryptonite, which give her an advantage over Clark. Hartley also stated that Harriet {{is the leader of}} Granny Goodness' Female Furies.|$|E
25|$|Tomlin {{was one of}} {{the first}} female comedians to break out in male drag with <b>her</b> <b>characters</b> Tommy Velour and Rick. In 1982, she premiered Pervis Hawkins, a black rhythm-and-blues soul singer (patterned after Luther Vandross), with a mustache, beard, and {{close-cropped}} afro hairstyle, dressed in a three-piece suit. Tomlin used very little, if any, skin-darkening cosmetics as part of the character, instead depending on stage lighting to create the effect.|$|E
500|$|Zoe is also {{portrayed as}} having a tomboy persona. Lister was asked about this [...] "tomboy" [...] {{personality}} during an interview with Maxim magazine, agreeing with the label and stating <b>her</b> <b>character</b> doesn't [...] "glam up" [...] {{as much as the}} other Hollyoaks characters. Maxim also noted the character was [...] "pretty popular with the boys". Lister has also commented that <b>her</b> <b>character</b> is not a stereotypical dizzy blonde, reiterated <b>her</b> <b>character's</b> tomboy status and added that she is a [...] "very street-smart type of woman." ...|$|R
50|$|Urd (Urudo) is a {{character}} in the popular Oh My Goddess! manga and anime, voiced by Toma Yumi (冬馬由美). In the series, <b>her</b> <b>character</b> is only loosely based on the deity Urðr from Norse mythology. Visually, <b>her</b> <b>character</b> design shows influences from shoujo and art nouveau.|$|R
50|$|<b>Her</b> <b>character</b> has no {{name in the}} film.|$|R
25|$|The life, customs, {{and traditions}} of the Sardinian people are {{prominent}} in her writing. She relies heavily on geographical description and details and her work is most often concerned with transgressions. Many of <b>her</b> <b>characters</b> are social outcasts that struggle in silence and isolation. Deledda's whole work is based on strong facts of love, pain and death upon which rests the feeling of sin and of an inevitable fatality.|$|E
25|$|When {{asked who}} the models for <b>her</b> <b>characters,</b> Loos would almost always {{say they were}} {{composites}} of various people, but when pressed, admitted that toothless flirt Sir Francis Beekman was modeled after writer Joseph Hergesheimer and producer Jesse L. Lasky. Dorothy Shaw was modeled after herself and Constance Talmadge, and Lorelei herself most closely resembled acquisitive Ziegfeld showgirl, Lillian Lorraine, who was always looking for new places to display the diamonds bestowed by her suitors.|$|E
25|$|On 27 April 2016, Tate {{announced}} {{she would be}} taking <b>her</b> <b>characters</b> on tour later the same year.

5000|$|Lefevre {{played the}} renegade vampire Victoria Sutherland {{in the film}} Twilight (2008), {{based on the novel}} of the same name by Stephenie Meyer. Lefevre wrote an impassioned letter to the director, {{explaining}} her desire to work with the filmmaker. Lefevre described the essence of <b>her</b> <b>character</b> as [...] "pure evil, pure instinct, pure malice, and very feline". After reading that the author used the word [...] "feline" [...] to describe <b>her</b> <b>character's</b> agility, Lefevre watched lion attacks on YouTube to separate the movements of <b>her</b> <b>character</b> from those of normal people. She also took trapeze classes in preparation for the wire work in the film. Lefevre spent hours working on the costumes for <b>her</b> <b>character,</b> and described herself as [...] "obsessed" [...] with vampires after reading Bram Stoker's Dracula at the age of 14.|$|R
