50|$|Holt was {{technically}} correct, as the Dynagroove process used tracing compensation, which pre-distorted {{the record}} groove {{to cancel out}} the distortion created by playback with a conical-shaped phonograph stylus, which could not track the record groove accurately in the high frequencies, especially in the <b>inner</b> <b>grooves</b> of an LP. The process worked well with playback via a conical stylus, typical of most phonograph cartridges prior to about 1964. However, if one played a Dynagroove record with an elliptical-shaped stylus, this pre-distortion became audible. As {{the decade of the}} 1960s progressed, high quality playback cartridges increasingly used elliptical styli. This development made tracing compensation obsolete by about 1970, and RCA quietly stopped using the technique.|$|E

5000|$|If {{one goes}} to the Madacy site to view their 101 Strings collection, exactly the same {{description}} that was used on the Bel Canto's ST- 76 two track stereo release about the 101 Strings sound is reprinted. The 50 Hz hum heard on many of those tape recordings {{was due to the}} Ampex 350's filtering which was not well suited for European 50 Hz power. The [...] "My Fair Lady" [...] and [...] "King and I" [...] releases have {{what appears to be the}} sound of dirty mixing pots used on the fly during those sessions. There were a number of tape releases that sounded like tape copies of pristine Stereo Fidelity vinyl which actually, were not all that pristine. Stereo recordings were made with a triangular cutting stylus. This resulted at times in pinch distortion which early conical styli did not handle well. <b>Inner</b> <b>grooves</b> especially, due to the increased density of the recorded information due to the slower relative movement of the track under the stylus, were more susceptible to distortion with conical styli in use at the time this record was released. The later development of elliptical styli allowed more precise tracking of the track and greatly reduced inner-track distortion.|$|E
5000|$|The Grip Weeds {{began their}} {{recording}} {{career with the}} 1992 three-song independent release See You Through on their own Ground Up Records label, followed by the single “She Brings The Rain b/w Strange Bird” for the German Twang! label. Their 1994 full-length album debut House Of Vibes, {{was the first to}} be recorded in their own fully equipped home studio, also known as “The House Of Vibes”. Known for its laid back atmosphere and a collection of vintage sound equipment and instruments, it has also been put to use by many other recording artists including The Smithereens, Jim Babjak’s Buzzed Meg, Najma Akhtar and Gary Lucas, The Swingin' Neckbreakers, The Anderson Council and more. [...] A second album, for Buy Or Die Compact Discs, The Sound Is In You, followed in 1998. The band signed with Rainbow Quartz Records for their 2001 release Summer Of A Thousand Years, and followed it up with Giant On The Beach in 2004. “Little Steven” Van Zandt’s Wicked Cool label released the compilation CD Infinite Soul: The Best Of The Grip Weeds in 2008, and Van Zandt has been a vocal supporter of the band. [...] Rainbow Quartz released the double CD and double vinyl LP Strange Change Machine in June 2010. 2012 saw the release on Ground Up Records of a live album, Speed of Live (In Concert: In New Jersey) along with a companion DVD release, Live Vibes featuring a [...] "live in the studio" [...] performance taped at The House Of Vibes. Ground Up Records followed the live releases with the 2013 rarities collection, <b>Inner</b> <b>Grooves</b> (Rare And Under-Released Tracks). After signing with Jem Recordings, the band released their sixth studio album How I Won The War on April 7, 2015. A 2015 concert at the Tribeca Performing Arts Center in New York City was filmed and recorded, and released on December 2nd, 2016 as a limited edition DVD titled [...] Force Of Nature Live In NYC. A companion CD, Force Of Nature Live Via Satellite was released simultaneously, consisting of a 2016 live studio performance recorded for Sirius/XM’s The Loft satellite radio show.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this letter is to propose a {{one-time}} exigent change to the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station (SSES) Unit 2 Technical Specifications to reflect enforcement discretion granted by the NRC on April 8, 2000 at 1430 hours. The proposed change will allow Unit 2 operation to continue until an outage occurs where leak rate surveillance testing on spectacle flanges 2 S 299 A and 2 S 299 B can be performed. Background The RHR relief valve discharge line penetrations provide the relief path from the RHR Heat Exchanger (shell side) to the suppression pool. This penetration was originally also intended to provide the flowpath for the RHR steam condensing mode, which {{was removed from the}} plant design prior to initial plant operation. During closeout of the Local Leak Rate Testing (LLRT) outage activities on the Unit 1 RHR relief valve line spectacle flange (1 $ 299 B), plant personnel questioned whether the design requires two or three o-rings per spectacle flange face. The spectacle flange on each face contains three grooves. The outer and <b>inner</b> <b>grooves</b> on each face are for the installation of o-rings.

50|$|A {{number of}} radio transcriptions were {{standard}} lateral grooved records (either playing at 33 1/3 or 78) but {{starting from the}} inside. An example was those made by the New York Judson Studios, starting in about 1928 or 1929 and running into the 1930s. Each record were 12", made of standard shellac, started in the <b>inner</b> <b>groove</b> and had a locked groove at the outer edge. Some radio transcription discs had both outside and inside-start {{as a way to}} maintain the fidelity levels when the record was turned over.|$|R
40|$|In the CO 2 {{heat pump}} system, Poly alkyl glycol (PAG) oil is {{commonly}} used for lubrication of the compressor, while it is reported that the PAG oil has influence on the heat transfer performance due to its immiscibility against CO 2 within its working condition. Experimental work {{has been carried out}} to investigate the heat transfer performance of fin and tube heat exchangers using CO 2 as a refrigerant with taking PAG oil into account. From previous study {{it was found that the}} heat transfer performance decreased significantly in both evaporator and gascooler conditions when oil was mixed. The present work presents experimental results on three types of air-cooled heat exchangers with smooth and <b>inner</b> <b>grooved</b> tubes. It was found that the deterioration ratio of heat transfer performance with oil was different depending on the inner surface geometry of the grooved tubes. To understand this, flow visualization inside these tubes has also been carried out through transparent section made of glass, which can withstand high pressure. It was confirmed that the oil behavior inside tubes was related to heat transfer performance. Heat transfer performance can be improved by using <b>inner</b> <b>grooved</b> tubes with the optimal pattern to remove oil away from inner surface. These tubes are effective to develop high performance heat exchangers for the CO 2 heat pump system...|$|R
2500|$|The nucleosomes bind DNA non-specifically, as {{required}} by their function in general DNA packaging. [...] There are, however, large DNA sequence preferences that govern nucleosome positioning. [...] This is due primarily to the varying physical properties of different DNA sequences: For instance, adenine and thymine are more favorably compressed into the <b>inner</b> minor <b>grooves.</b> This means nucleosomes can bind preferentially at one position approximately every 10 base pairs (the helical repeat of DNA)- where the DNA is rotated to maximise the number of A and T bases that will lie in the <b>inner</b> minor <b>groove.</b> (See mechanical properties of DNA.) ...|$|R

50|$|A {{complicated}} slipper {{bearing system}} {{was used in}} the Le Rhône engine. The master rod was of a split-type, which permitted assembly of the connecting rods. It also employed three concentric grooves, designed to accept slipper bearings from the other cylinders. The other connecting rods used inner-end bronze shoes, which were shaped to fit in the grooves. The master rod was numbered as number one and the shoes of numbers two, five and eight rode in the outer groove, the shoes of three, six and nine in the middle groove and four and seven in the <b>inner</b> <b>groove.</b> Although this system was complex, the Le Rhône engines worked very well.|$|R
5000|$|Master=Diks {{liner notes}} reprint a rant by Ben Weasel from the November 1987 {{issue of the}} fanzine Maximumrocknroll. In the article, Weasel criticized Sonic Youth, Hüsker Dü and several other indie rock bands from the 1980s for eschewing punk rock for a boring classic rock sound. Etchings on the vinyl's <b>inner</b> <b>groove</b> read [...] "Ciccone death rock dream tinkle" [...] on one side, and [...] "Humpy pumpy psychoacoustik frenzy" [...] on the other. When it was {{originally}} released, the album sleeve bore a sticker reading [...] "Not as good as Atomizer, so don't get your hopes up, cheese!" [...] The same sticker appeared on Big Black's EP Headache released that same year, and referred to that band's previous album.|$|R
500|$|The final track, [...] "Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast", {{is divided}} into three segments, each with its own {{descriptive}} title, joined by dialogue and sound effects of then-roadie Alan Styles preparing, discussing, and eating breakfast. The idea for the piece came about by Waters experimenting with the rhythm of a dripping tap, which combined sound effects and dialogue recorded by Mason in his kitchen with musical pieces recorded at Abbey Road. A slightly re-worked version was performed on stage on 22 December 1970 at Sheffield City Hall, Sheffield, England with the band members pausing between pieces to eat and drink their breakfast. The original LP ends with the sound of the tap which continues into the <b>inner</b> <b>groove,</b> and thus plays on indefinitely.|$|R

2500|$|The {{cylinder}} {{system had}} certain advantages. As noted, wax cylinders {{could be used}} for home recordings, and [...] "indestructible" [...] types could be played over and over many more times than the disc. Cylinders usually rotated twice as fast as contemporary discs, but the linear velocity was comparable to the innermost grooves of the disc. In theory, this would provide generally poorer audio fidelity. Furthermore, since constant angular velocity translates into constant linear velocity (the radius of the helical track is constant), cylinders were also free from <b>inner</b> <b>groove</b> problems suffered by disc recordings. Around 1900, cylinders were, on average, indeed of notably higher audio quality than contemporary discs, but as disc makers improved their technology by 1910 the fidelity differences between better discs and cylinders became minimal.|$|R
25|$|The newly invented Western Electric {{moving coil}} or dynamic {{microphone}} {{was part of}} the Wide Range System. It had a flatter audio response than the old style Wente condenser type and didn't require electronics installed in the microphone housing. Signals fed to the cutting head were pre-emphasized in the treble region to help override noise in playback. Groove cuts in the vertical plane were employed rather than the usual lateral cuts. The chief advantage claimed was more grooves per inch that could be crowded together, resulting in longer playback time. Additionally, the problem of <b>inner</b> <b>groove</b> distortion, which plagued lateral cuts, could be avoided with the vertical cut system. Wax masters were made by flowing heated wax over a hot metal disc thus avoiding the microscopic irregularities of cast blocks of wax and the necessity of planing and polishing.|$|R
5000|$|Tm {{functions}} {{in association with}} the troponin complex to regulate the calcium-dependent interaction of actin and myosin during muscle contraction. Tm molecules are arranged head-to-tail along the actin thin filament, and are a key component in cooperative activation of muscle. A three state model has been proposed by McKillop and Geeves, which describes the positions of Tm during a cardiac cycle. The blocked (B) state occurs in diastole when intracellular calcium is low and Tm blocks the myosin binding site on actin. The closed (C) state is when Tm is positioned on the <b>inner</b> <b>groove</b> of actin; in this state myosin is in a [...] "cocked" [...] position where heads are weakly bound and not generating force. The myosin binding (M) state is when Tm is further displaced from actin by myosin crossbridges that are strongly-bound and actively generating force. In addition to actin, Tm binds troponin T (TnT). TnT tethers the region of head-to-tail overlap of subsequent Tm molecules to actin.|$|R
40|$|As a Rzeppa joint is manufactured, the {{dimension}} variation of relative groove position makes {{a significant difference}} on the ball-groove Hertz stress. This difference results in the durability variation of the joints. An ideal inner race and an <b>inner</b> race with <b>groove</b> spacing error are simulated with an ADAMS model. The angular spacing error of the <b>inner</b> race <b>grooves</b> results in uneven Hertz stress distribution among six outer race grooves. Two of them are exposed to extra wear. A durability test is conducted with the inner race of spacing error. The simulation is well supported by the test result. Further simulation shows the ball-groove Hertz stress is also affected by the relative position of the outer race groove center to the outer race sphere center. And the Hertz stress is {{more sensitive to the}} off-axis error than to the along-axis error...|$|R
40|$|Formation of the nucleus&# 8211;vacuole {{junction}} (NVJ) {{is mediated}} by direct {{interaction between the}} vacuolar protein Vac 8 p and the outer nuclear endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein Nvj 1 p. Herein we report the crystal structure of Vac 8 p bound to Nvj 1 p at 2. 4 -Å resolution. Vac 8 p comprises a flexibly connected N-terminal H 1 helix followed by 12 armadillo repeats (ARMs) that form a right-handed superhelical structure. The extended 80 -Å-long loop of Nvj 1 p specifically binds the highly conserved <b>inner</b> <b>groove</b> formed from ARM 1 &# 8722; 12 of Vac 8 p. Disruption of the Nvj 1 p&# 8211;Vac 8 p interaction results {{in the loss of}} tight NVJs, which impairs piecemeal microautophagy of the nucleus in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Vac 8 p cationic triad (Arg 276, Arg 317, and Arg 359) motifs interacting with Nvj 1 p are also critical to the recognition of Atg 13 p, a key component of the cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting (CVT) pathway, indicating competitive binding to Vac 8 p. Indeed, mutation of the cationic triad abolishes CVT of Ape 1 p in vivo. Combined with biochemical data, the crystal structure reveals a Vac 8 p homodimer formed from ARM 1, and this self-association, likely regulated by the flexible H 1 helix and the C terminus of Nvj 1 p, is critical for Vac 8 p cellular functions...|$|R
40|$|Technical Evaluation Motor No. 5 (TEM- 5) was {{static test}} {{fired at the}} Thiokol Corporation Static Test Bay T- 97. TEM- 5 was a full scale, full {{duration}} static test fire of a high performance motor (HPM) configuration solid rocket motor (SRM). The primary purpose of TEM static tests is to recover SRM case and nozzle hardware {{for use in the}} redesigned solid rocket motor (RSRM) flight program. Inspection and instrumentation data indicate that the TEM- 5 static test firing was successful. The ambient temperature during the test was 41 F and the propellant mean bulk temperature (PMBT) was 72 F. Ballistics performance values were within the specified requirements. The overall performance of the TEM- 5 components and test equipment was nominal. Dissembly inspection revealed that joint putty was in contact with the <b>inner</b> <b>groove</b> of the <b>inner</b> primary seal of the ignitor adapter-to-forward dome (inner) joint gasket; this condition had not occurred on any previous static test motor or flight RSRM. While no qualification issues were addressed on TEM- 5, two significant component changes were evaluated. Those changes were a new vented assembly process for the case-to-nozzle joint and the installation of two redesigned field joint protection systems. Performance of the vented case-to-nozzle joint assembly was successful, and the assembly/performance differences between the two field joint protection system (FJPS) configurations were compared...|$|R
