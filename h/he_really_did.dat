25|$|In 1986 John D. Ray {{suggested}} that Hakor was Nepherites' heir, who ruled undisturbed until his Year 2 {{when he was}} deposed by Psammuthes. After another year, Hakor managed to retake his legitimate throne by overthrowing the usurper, and continued to date his reign since his first coronation date, simply pretending that this gap never occurred. The third pretender, Muthis, could be inserted within this struggle, but his role – assuming that <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> exist – is unknown. Ray's hypothesis is accepted by other Egyptologists such as Alan B. Lloyd and Toby Wilkinson.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the context}} is often overlooked, and the {{quotation}} usually chopped off, one of Sherman's most famous statements about his hard-war views arose {{in part from}} the racial attitudes summarized above. In his Memoirs, Sherman noted political pressures in 1864–1865 to encourage the escape of slaves, in part to avoid the possibility that [...] "'able-bodied slaves will be called into the military service of the rebels.'"

"Simpson Tide" [...] {{was one of}} two season nine episodes {{that was}} {{executive}} produced by Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who together were the showrunners for the third and fourth seasons. Although Jean would later return to run the show the following season, it was the last episode that Reiss received an executive producer credit for. Joshua Sternin and Jeffrey Ventimilia, the episode writers, were working on Jean and Reiss's show The Critic at the time, and pitched an episode where Homer joins the Naval Reserve. Although the episode is partly based on the film Crimson Tide, the original episode pitch was made before the film was released. After the release of the film, the writers decided to start incorporating things from the movie in the script. In the original draft, Bart sneaked on board the submarine with Homer. They were trying to do it [...] "for the comedy of it", but could not get the draft to work, so it was cut. It was difficult for them {{to figure out how to}} get the captain off of the sub and they eventually decided to have him shot out of the torpedo tube, which in the DVD commentary, Al Jean says that Steiger claimed that <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> get stuck in a torpedo tube once.|$|E
