5000|$|Some manzanita {{species are}} among the rarest plants in the world. The endemic Arctostaphylos hookeri ravenii (Presidio manzanita) is the most {{endangered}} and restricted plant in the mainland United States. In 1987 only one specimen remained, at a secret location in the Presidio of San Francisco National Historic Landmark District in San Francisco, California. This plant has since been successfully cloned. [...] Arctostaphylos franciscana (Franciscan Manzanita), a species native to San Francisco, had not been seen growing wild since 1947 until it was spotted growing in the Presidio of San Francisco in October 2009. Caltrans transplanted this specimen on 23 January 2010 {{to make way for}} the Doyle Drive Replacement Project. [...] Transplanting costs were funded in part by Federal <b>Highways</b> <b>Administration,</b> Caltrans, The Presidio of San Francisco, and private donors.|$|E

40|$|The Interactive Highway Safety Design Model (IHSDM) is a {{suite of}} {{evaluation}} tools for assessing the safety impacts of geometric design decisions. Developed over almost a decade by the US Federal <b>Highways</b> <b>Administration</b> (FHWA), this publicly available software can help planners and designers identify and assess treatments for potential safety problems on existing or proposed highway sections. The initial development effort focused on two-lane rural highways, making IHSDM also very applicable to the bulk of New Zealand's state highway network. However a number of tasks have been required to make IHSDM appropriate for New Zealand conditions. These include calibrating the crash prediction model to reflect local patterns, incorporating a set of New Zealand-specific design policies and standards, validating the speed prediction model, modifying the model’s vehicle fleet, and developing a means of importing existing road geometry data into IHSDM. This paper reports on the work required to undertake these tasks and test the revised model’s applicability to New Zealand highways. Case studies of actual rural realignments {{are being used to}} check IHSDM’s practical usability and its crash rate predictions...|$|E

40|$|The {{analyses}} {{that can be}} conducted in a given public policy area are often limited by the content of a single database but often require data that are available {{from more than one}} source (Rodgers 1984). It is useful if data from multiple databases can be combined (fused) to support planning and decision-making. Except in the simplest cases, such fusion poses hard statistical problems. This paper describes an effort to address some of these problems through the use of recursive partitioning regression (CART). To illustrate our approach, we take the first steps to fuse household travel data that were obtained from two surveys performed for the United States Department of Transportation in 1995. The first data set is from the Nationwide Personal Transportation Survey (NPTS); this survey was performed for the Federal <b>Highways</b> <b>Administration,</b> and focused upon daily travel (mostly short trips). The second data set is from the American Travel Survey (ATS), which was run by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS); the ATS focused on long-distance travel (trips of 100 miles or more). Both surveys collected data on household demographics and trip characteristics from the sam...|$|E
40|$|Technology Transfer (T 2) Centres {{have become}} a very {{important}} medium in the transportation sector both nationally and internationally {{especially with regard to}} bridging the divide between technology development and its practical implementation. Since October 2002, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) Built Environment has been host to one of three T 2 Centres in South Africa (the other two are housed at the South African National Roads Agency in Pretoria and KwaZulu-Natal Department of Transport in Pietermaritzburg). The CSIR chapter was established in collaboration with the United States Federal <b>Highways</b> <b>Administration</b> (FHWA), with the primary objective being to identify the needs of the transportation sector with a view to facilitating the provision and dissemination of technology, policies, practices and procedures, as well as technical skills and expertise to the wider transportation community in southern Africa. With the help of some practical examples, this paper seeks to highlight the importance of technology transfer, not only in stimulating innovation, but also in broadening livelihood opportunities as well as in strengthening local institutions. A strand of thought that runs through the paper is that as the gradual shift to a knowledge society takes shape, even in developing rural environs, knowledge becomes an entrenched production factor. In this regard, continuous learning processes are considered pivotal for the successful performance and adoption of technologies. A final conclusion is also evident – in order to ensure sustained impact from technology transfer and adoption activities, the ultimate metric is participation as encapsulated in the old Chinese adage “Tell me and I will forget. Show me and I will remember. Involve me and I will know”...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the process and}} results of a demonstration of solid-state lighting (SSL) technology conducted in 2009 at the recently reconstructed I- 35 W bridge in Minneapolis, MN. The project was supported under the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Solid-State Lighting GATEWAY Technology Demonstration Program. Other participants in the demonstration project included the Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT), Federal <b>Highways</b> <b>Administration</b> (FHWA), and BetaLED™ (a division of Ruud Lighting). Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) conducted the measurements {{and analysis of the}} results. DOE has implemented a three-year evaluation of the LED luminaires in this installation in order to develop new longitudinal field data on LED performance in a challenging, real-world environment. This document provides information through the initial phase of the I- 35 W bridge project, up to and including the opening of the bridge to the public and the initial feedback received on the LED lighting installation from bridge users. Initial findings of the evaluation are favorable, with minimum energy savings level of 13 % for the LED installation relative to the simulated base case using 250 W high-pressure sodium (HPS) fixtures. The LEDs had an average illuminance level of 0. 91 foot candles compared to 1. 29 fc for the HPS lamps. The LED luminaires cost $ 38, 000 more than HPS lamps, yielding a lengthy payback period, however the bridge contractor had offered to include the LED luminaires as part of the construction package at no additional cost. One potentially significant benefit of the LEDs in this installation is avoiding rolling lane closures on the heavily-traveled interstate bridge for the purpose of relamping the HPS fixtures. Rolling lane closures involve multiple crew members and various maintenance and safety vehicles, diversion of traffic, as well as related administrative tasks (e. g., approvals, scheduling, etc.). Mn/DOT records show an average cost of relamping fixtures along interstate roadways of between $ 130 - 150 per pole. The previous bridge saw a lamp mortality rate of approximately 50 % every two years, though the new bridge was designed to minimize many of the vibration issues. A voluntary Web-based feedback survey of nearly 500 self-described bridge users showed strong preference for the LED lighting - positive comments outnumbered negative ones by about five-to-one...|$|E

40|$|The Western Governor’s Association and 17 {{western states}} are {{developing}} an online web application or CHAT (crucial habitat assessment tool). When completed {{at the end}} of 2013, this application will aid energy, transportation and land use development as well as in prioritizing conservation, mitigation, and restoration plans for benefit of wildlife. The tool is intended to make individual state fish and wildlife information seamless across state boundaries while providing for individual state differences in data, management, and policy. The CHAT being developed by the 17 western states is using both a fine and coarse filter for determining crucial area categories at the 1 square mile scale; including empirical data on individual species and mapped habitats and modeled species distribution, habitat fragmentation, and landscape connectivity data layers. Crucial area categorization of a westwide, 1 square mile hexagonal grid will be accomplished in a data roll up of these filters using either an aggregate, hierarchical, or fuzzy sum approach. The WGA effort is funded by individual states, the U. S. Department of Energy and Transportation, USFWS Landscape Conservation Cooperatives, and conservation NGO’s such as the Wildlife Conservation Society.

40|$|In {{a project}} {{funded by the}} U. S. Department of Transportation - Federal <b>Highways</b> <b>Administration</b> and the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT), the Jeffrey L. Brown Institute of Archaeology, University of Tennessee at Chattanooga (UTC), {{conducted}} archaeological testing of historic site 40 WG 60 surrounding a residential structure designated the Hammer-Taylor House. Situated off State Route 34 on the northeastern outskirts of Johnson City, Washington County, Tennessee, the architecturally-unique Hammer-Taylor House was to be rehabilitated on a new site pending highway expansion which would engulf its original setting. The archaeological research was conducted in July, 1989, under a standing agreement between TDOT and the Transportation Center, University of Tennessee, Knoxville. The research {{was carried out in}} response to a request for proposal from the Environmental Planning Office, TDOT, Nashville. The Jeffrey L. Brown Institute of Archaeology at the University of Tennessee, Chattanooga, responded to the request-for proposal (RFP) with a technical proposal and budget for the conduct of secondary archaeological testing on the historic occupation site surrounding the Hammer-Taylor house. A contract to conduct the testing was awarded to the Institute, and an excavation permit was issued by the Division of Archaeology, Department of Conservation. Consisting of a single pen two-story log cabin built in the period 1790 - 1806 joined under one roof with a Federal style double pen two-story brick structure built about 1844, the Hammer-Taylor house was scheduled for relocation and rehabilitation. The house proper was determined to be eligible for the National Register of Historic Places and therefore the surrounding archaeological site was required under 36 CFR 60. 6 to be tested for significance. A program of subsurface testing was developed to intercept closed context features such as wells, cisterns, and privies, in addition to sampling sheet refuse deposits around the immediate environs of the house proper. Archaeological fieldwork in July, 1989, involved hand excavation of eleven test pits situated within a uniform site grid and vertically controlled by semi-permanent transit stations. The fill in approximately half of the eleven test units was sampled by 1 / 42 ̆ 2 screening for uniform artifact recovery, while in the remaining units, artifacts were shovel sorted. Several weeks prior to the testing, two modern additions on the rear and side of the house were removed by heavy machinery, resulting in severe subsurface disturbances (in the form. of truncation and rutting) on three sides of the structure. Excavations {{in the rear of the}} house documented truncation of soil horizons after c. 1968, while at the southwest corner of the house site, 19 th century sheet refuse deposits were intercepted. Two 20 th century pipe lines evidently connected the house with a natural spring south of the structure. A cistern in the rear of the house lot was found to contain debris from the last half of the 20 th century, although its construction may have occurred early in the 19 th century. An unlined privy vault was also noted, and contained refuse discarded after 1968. A sample of the original builders 2 ̆ 7 trench to the brick unit of the house yielded insufficient numbers of datable artifacts to refine the historically-indicated construction date of 1844. Further controlled hand excavation on the site was not recommended in view of profile truncation and the general absence of undisturbed sheet refuse deposits. Instead, it was recommended that during and after the relocation 2 ̆ 7 of the house, the area around the house be stripped by machine and that documentation and excavation of closed-context features be carried out. This salvage operation would occur in the context of excavations associated with archaeological clearance of the road excavations required to transport the Hammer-Taylor house to its new site. Artifacts recovered during the testing program and all primary site documentation and analysis records will be curated in Nashville by the Division of Archaeology. [URL]...|$|E
