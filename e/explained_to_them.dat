Baek San <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> that the NSS is a secret organization tasked with preempting foreign threats and protecting the country's interests through wetwork operations, including assassination of anyone who could be a threat to South Korean (SK) national security. Since its founding in 1976, during the rule of Park Chung-hee, the agency's very existence has remained a state secret from everyone, including the President.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, a New Year's Eve benefit {{event was}} held for the Council on Religion and the Homosexual. Police stood outside with large floodlights, and {{in an effort to}} intimidate took {{photographs}} of anyone entering the building. Later, several officers demanded that they be allowed inside. Three lawyers <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> that under California law, the event was a private party and they could not enter unless they bought tickets. The lawyers were then arrested. Several ministers who were in attendance held a press conference the next morning, likening the SFPD to the Gestapo. Even the Catholic archbishop strongly condemned the actions of the police. In an attempt to reduce such harassment two officers were tasked with improving the police department's relationship with the gay community.|$|E

Needing songs for the soundtrack of the movie, she contacted Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray, who had written and produced her third studio album True Blue in 1986. Madonna <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> that she needed an uptempo song and a downtempo song. She came to the studio one Thursday as Leonard developed the chorus of the song. He handed over that cassette to Madonna, who went to the backroom and finished the melody and the lyrics of the song, while Leonard worked on the other parts of the song.|$|E

5|$|Akane Tsunemori {{was created}} by the Production I.G staff to be the most {{relatable}} character in the series. She would question the setting from the audience's point of view and have it <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> She was written as the heroine, who would come between the main character, Shinya Kogami, and his main rival, Shogo Makishima, and see their conflict from her own viewpoint. One of the staff's main objectives was Akane's growth. Akane appears {{at the start of the}} first season as an innocent rookie who matures through her experiences. This was affirmed by Japanese female actor Kana Hanazawa, who voices Akane in Japanese. Hanazawa said one of the focal points of the series after the third episode was the changes Akane would undergo; she would be influenced by many unfamiliar, traumatic experience she must endure as part of her policing role.|$|E

According to Smith, King James was so unprepossessing that neither Pocahontas nor Tomocomo realized whom they had met until it was <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> afterward.|$|E
25|$|The {{prevalence}} of mitempfindung {{is difficult to}} determine exactly, because many individuals would not be aware of having referred itch until the phenomenon is <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> Consequently, variability exists within the scientific literature as to the actual {{prevalence of}} referred itch in humans. Mittelmann (1920) has reported that 8 out of 9 people questioned experienced referred sensations. In 1973, Sterling reported that about half of 20 healthy individuals questioned had mitempfindung.|$|E

25|$|In 1962, Arye Oded, an Israeli {{studying}} at Makerere University, visited the Abayudaya and met Samson Mugombe. This {{was the first}} time the Abayudaya had ever met an Israeli and the first Jew they had met since Yosef. Oded had many long interviews with Mugombe and other leaders and <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> how Jews in Israel practised Judaism. Oded then wrote a book ("Religion and Politics in Uganda,") and numerous articles on the community and their customs which introduced them to world Jewry.

Public denial of Communion must be avoided and so the reasons for exclusion must be <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> but if such precautionary measures fail to obtain the desired effect or are impossible, Communion {{is not to be}} given to them.|$|E
25|$|Two covers {{were created}} for The Fame Monster, {{both of which}} were shot by French {{photographer}} Hedi Slimane. In the artwork of the standard edition, Gaga is seen sporting a blond wig and a sleek, angular black coat, the collar of which covers the lower half of her face. The image of the deluxe version sees the singer draped in thick brown hair, her face embellished with heavy, streamy black eyeliner. At first Gaga had a dispute with her record label over the artwork; Interscope found the brunette cover to be too dark and gothic for a mainstream release. However, Gaga <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> that both would be suitable with the yin and yang concept of the album and ultimately they agreed. The font used on the cover is the sans-serif letterform used by Christian Dior in their campaigns.|$|E

25|$|Starr {{took the}} {{position}} part-time and remained active with his law firm, Kirkland & Ellis, {{as this was}} permitted by statute and was also the norm with previous independent counsel investigations. As time went on, however, Starr was increasingly criticized for alleged conflicts of interest stemming from his continuing association with Kirkland & Ellis. Kirkland, like several other major law firms, was representing clients in litigation with the government, including tobacco companies and auto manufacturers. The firm itself was being sued by the Resolution Trust Company, a government agency involved in the Whitewater matter. Additionally, Starr's own actions were challenged because Starr had, on one occasion, talked with lawyers for Paula Jones, who was suing Bill Clinton over an alleged sexual assault. Starr had <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> why he believed that sitting U.S.presidents are not immune to civil suit.|$|E
25|$|In 1912 the Bulgarian army acceded Kochan to {{the present}} Bulgarian state. Unlike the {{inhabitants}} of most neighboring villages, the inhabitants of Kochan chose to convert to Christianity when they were posed an ultimatum by the Bulgarian army and they avoided the genocide {{which took place in}} many villages in Rhodope. The mayor and the imam of the village gathered the people and <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> that according to the Koran it is permissible to convert to other religion when threaten by death, on the condition to remain a true Muslim in the heart. When the army arrived, it destroyed the mosque and built a church. Eventually the church was dismissed and the mosque and Islam restored by the end of 1913 with the beginning of the Second Balkan War and the establishment of the Provisional Government of Western Thrace.|$|E

As Shu Commandery was centred around the {{imperial}} capital, Chengdu, it had the largest population among all the commanderies. In the {{six or seven years}} of relative peace after Zhuge Liang's death, the Shu government decided to give out compensation to war veterans. During this time, many people attempted to cheat the system by impersonating dead soldiers or pretending to have fought in the campaigns, so that they could claim the compensation. When Lü Yi found out, he immediately imposed stricter regulations to prevent such abuses of the system. At the same time, he also counselled the people and <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> the benefits of serving in the military. His efforts proved successful as within a few years, over 10,000 men voluntarily joined the army.|$|E

25|$|Approximately half of {{patients}} attending {{mental health services}} for conditions including anxiety disorders such as panic disorder or social phobia {{are the result of}} alcohol or benzodiazepine dependence. Sometimes anxiety pre-existed alcohol or benzodiazepine dependence but the alcohol or benzodiazepine dependence act to keep the anxiety disorders going and often progressively making them worse. Many people who are addicted to alcohol or prescribed benzodiazepines when it is <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> they have a choice between ongoing ill mental health or quitting and recovering from their symptoms decide on quitting alcohol or their benzodiazepines. It was noted that every individual has an individual sensitivity level to alcohol or sedative hypnotic drugs and what one person can tolerate without ill health another will suffer very ill health and that even moderate drinking can cause rebound anxiety syndromes and sleep disorders. A person who is suffering the toxic effects of alcohol or benzodiazepines will not benefit from other therapies or medications as they do not address the root cause of the symptoms. Symptoms may temporarily worsen however, during alcohol withdrawal or benzodiazepine withdrawal.|$|E
25|$|The first, {{beginning}} in the 1950s, was {{the inclusion of the}} Lieberman clause, named for Talmudic scholar and Jewish Theological Seminary (JTS) professor Saul Lieberman, in the ketuba, requiring that a get be granted if a civil divorce is ever issued. Most Orthodox rabbis have rejected the Lieberman clause, although leaders of the Conservative movement claim that the original intent was to find a solution that could be used by Orthodox and Conservative rabbis alike, and that leaders of Orthodox Judaism's Rabbinical Council of America, and respected Orthodox rabbis, including Joseph B. Soloveitchik, supposedly recognized the clause as valid. Later, because some civil courts viewed the enforcement of a religious document as a violation of the constitutional principle of {{the separation of church and}} state, Conservative rabbis began to require couples to sign a separate letter, stating that the clause had been <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> as part of pre-marital counseling, and that both parties understood and agreed to its conditions, recognizing that this letter would constitute a separate civil document, enforceable in a civilian court. However, many Conservative rabbis, including some on the movement's own law committee, had growing misgivings about the clause for religious reasons.|$|E

Madonna <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> that she needed an uptempo song and a downtempo song. As per her demands, Leonard developed the uptempo song. Madonna came to the recording studio one Thursday, and Leonard handed her a cassette of a recording of the chorus, which he had just finished working on. Madonna went to the backroom and completed the melody and the lyrics of the song, while Leonard worked on the other parts of it. After finishing the lyrics, Madonna decided to name the song [...] "Who's That Girl", and changed the title of Slammer to the same, considering it to be a better name. In Fred Bronson's book The Billboard Book of Number 1 Hits, Leonard explained that the song was recorded in one day with Madonna recording her vocals only once. Additional guitar and percussion tracks were added later by Leonard and Bray.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{wanted to}} have gospel music {{as part of the}} song, with {{virtually}} no instrumentation, only the sound of an organ and her singing. So she started experimenting using just her vocals, giving away to the bridge being composed. After the full song was finalized, Madonna and Leonard decided to record it alongside a choir around September 1988. Both of them met with musician Andraé Crouch and vocalist Roberto Noriega, and signed their choir to provide background vocals. Crouch scrutinized the lyrics as he wanted to [...] "find out what the intention of the song might be. We're very particular in choosing what we work with, and we liked what we heard." [...] At Jonny Yuma recording studio, he got his choir together and <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> what they needed to do during the recording session. He had listened to the demo of [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] in his car, and directed the choir accordingly. The choir was recorded separately, and Leonard wanted it to be added during post-production.|$|E
500|$|... "Masterpiece" [...] was {{composed}} by Madonna, Julie Frost and Jimmy Harry and produced by Madonna and William Orbit. When Madonna was directing her film W.E., her manager Guy Oseary persuaded the singer {{to compose a}} song for the soundtrack.

[...] "She is an icon", Frost said, [...] "But most importantly she has some of the best Pop songs in the history of music... so yeah it's always a dream to work with people like her." [...] Orbit, who was working with Frost and Harry on an assignment, contacted them for collaborating with Madonna on [...] "Masterpiece". He had heard Frost's initial composition of the song and knew that Madonna would love it. According to Frost the theme <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> was about bittersweet love and the hardships felt being in a relationship. Madonna, Frost and Harry sat together with this idea and brainstormed and came up with the lyrics and the melody. Over time, Madonna changed the structure of the song and the final version was ready for recording. Madonna recalled: ...|$|E
