40|$|The report {{enclosed}} herewith relates the construction history and interim performance of an experimental pavement in which coal tar (RT- 12) was substituted for asphalt cement (PAC- 5) ··all other design features were basically similar to asphaltic concrete paving projects abutting {{each end of}} the experimental section. The resulting tar mixtures were in general conformity with Mixes 4 T {base) and 7 T (surface) of ASTM D 1753 - 67. Although the Marshall stability was 3000 pounds at I 00 °F, the tar surface course has thinned in the wheel tracks and thickened outside the wheel paths.

40|$|To {{increase}} {{the speed and}} efficiency of shallow seismic data recording and thereby decrease acquisition costs, {{the concept of a}} towed land streamer containing self-orienting, gimbal-mounted geophones is being evalu-ated. Our initial experiments at two locations within Switzerland demonstrate that good coupling with the ground may be achieved when the gimbal-mounted ver-tical geophones are contained in heavy (- 1 kg) casings and pulled along a very shallow (2 - 3 cm deep) furrow. Such a furrow may be created by mounting a <b>heavy</b> <b>wheel</b> on the towing vehicle. Placing the geophones in even heavier casings may provide the necessary good coupling with the ground, negating the need for the fur-row. Shot gathers and stacked sections recorded with the gimbal-mounted geophones are practically indistin-guishable from those recorded with conventional spike geophones. The principal advantage of this approach is that significantly fewer field personnel (only two or three) are required than for conventional shallow seis-mic surveying.

40|$|HIPAVE (Heavy Industrial PAVEment design) {{is for the}} {{mechanistic}} {{analysis and}} design of flexible pavements subjected to the extremely <b>heavy</b> <b>wheel</b> loads associated with freight handling vehicles in industrial facilities, in particular, intermodal container terminals. HIPAVE is an outgrowth of CIRCLY and APSDS (Airport Pavement Structural Design System). HIPAVE does a full spectral analysis of pavement damage by using the cumulative damage concept to sum the damage from multiple vehicle models and payloads. HIPAVE can expedite pavement design projects with these unique features: a standard vehicle library- that can be automatically updated via the Internet; ability to define and store container weight distributions; automatic calculation of axle loads from vehicle geometry and container weight; user defined material performance properties (stiffness and transfer functions). This paper presents the development and advantages of using HIPAVE, over simpler layered elastic tools and empirical chart based methods, to design pavements. HIPAVE {{has been used for}} the design of the Crawford Street intermodal container handling facility in Hamilton, New Zealand. This design was complicated by a weak subgrade and height restrictions for the pavement surface.

40|$|Pavement {{subsurface}} drainage {{and its effect}} on pavement performance has been a subject of interest since the 18 th and 19 th centuries. With no doubt the detrimental effects of <b>heavy</b> <b>wheel</b> loads on pavements with saturated base material is a significant factor. The consequence of subsurface water on pavement performance includes premature rutting, cracking, faulting, and increased roughness, all of which lead to a decrease in serviceability. ^ This research study involves field instrumentation, laboratory testing, field data collection, and numerical modeling. The main objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the subdrainage performance of three pavement sections adopted by the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT). Instruments were installed to monitor the air and pavement temperature, frost penetration, and pavement moisture conditions, and time and duration of rainfall and pavement outflow volumes. Subgrade and asphalt core samples were obtained from the field. Tests were performed on these samples to determine their hydraulic conductivity characteristics. ^ The filter layer was found to be the most significant relative to subdrainage performance. An impermeable filter layer showed better drainage performance than a more permeable layer. The drainage pipe was found to have low flow capacity, which increased the drainage time for all sections. The finite element analysis highlighted the moisture flow conditions in the pavement. Several recommendations concerning the base and filter layer were made. A different section configuration is proposed. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{transmissions}} {{of present}} <b>heavy</b> <b>wheel</b> loaders are in general based on torque converters. The characteristics of this component suits these machines, especially {{in that it}} enables thrust from zero vehicle speed without risk of stalling the engine, without active control. Unfortunately, the component also causes losses which might become large compared to the transmitted power. One approach for mitigating these losses is {{to switch to a}} continuously variable transmission. Changing to such a system greatly increases the possibility, and the need, for actively selecting the engine speed, and here a conflict emerges. A low engine speed is desired for high efficiency but a high speed is required for high power. <b>Heavy</b> <b>wheel</b> loaders often operate according to a common repeating pattern known as the short loading cycle. This cycle is extremely transient, which makes the choice of engine operating point both important and difficult. At the same time, the repeating pattern in the operation enables a rough prediction of the future operation. One way to use the uncertain prediction is to use optimization techniques for selecting the best control actions. This requires a method for detecting the operational pattern and producing a prediction from this, to formulate a manageable optimization problem, and for solving this, and finally to actually control the machine according to the optimization results. This problem is treated in the four papers that are included in this dissertation. The first paper describes a method for automatically detecting when the machine is operating according to any of several predefined patterns. The detector uses events and automata descriptions of the cycles, which makes the method simple yet powerful. In the evaluations over 90 % of the actual cycles are detected and correctly identified. The detector also enables a quick analysis of large datasets. In several of the following papers this is used to condense measured data sequences into statistical cycles for the control optimization. In the second paper dynamic programming and Pontryagin’s maximum principle is applied to a simplified system consisting of a diesel engine and a generator. Methods are developed based on the maximum principle analysis, for finding the fuel optimal trajectories at output power steps, and the simplicity of the system enables a deeper analysis of these solutions. The methods are used to examine and visualize the mechanisms behind the solutions at power transients, and the models form the basis for the models in the following papers. The third paper describes two different concepts for implementing dynamic programming based optimal control of a hydrostatic transmission. In this system one load component forms a stochastic state constraint, and the concepts present two different strategies for handling this constraint. The controller concepts are evaluated through simulations, in terms of implementability, robustness against uncertainties in the prediction and fuel savings. The fourth paper describes the implementation and testing of a predictive controller, based on stochastic dynamic programming, for the engine and generator in a diesel electric powertrain. The controller is evaluated through both simulations and field tests, with several drivers, at a realistic work site, thus including all relevant disturbances and uncertainties. The evaluations indicate a ∼ 5 % fuel benefit of utilizing a cycle prediction in the controller...|$|E
40|$|<b>Heavy</b> <b>wheel</b> traffic causes soil compaction, which {{adversely}} affects {{crop production}} and may persist for several years. We applied known compaction forces to entire plots annually for 5 years, and then determined {{the duration of}} the adverse effects on the properties of a Vertisol and the performance of crops under no-till dryland cropping with residue retention. For up to 5 years after a final treatment with a 10 Mg axle load on wet soil, soil shear strength at 70 - 100 mm and cone index at 180 - 360 mm were significantly (P < 0. 05) higher than in a control treatment, and soil water storage and grain yield were lower. We conclude that compaction effects persisted because (1) there were insufficient wet-dry cycles to swell and shrink the entire compacted layer, (2) soil loosening by tillage was absent and (3) there were fewer earthworms in the compacted soil. Compaction of dry soil with 6 Mg had little effect at any time, indicating that by using wheel traffic only when the soil is dry, problems can be avoided. Unfortunately such a restriction is not always possible because sowing, tillage and harvest operations often need to be done when the soil is wet. A more generally applicable solution, which also ensures timely operations, is the permanent separation of wheel zones and crop zones in the field [...] the practice known as controlled traffic farming. Where a compacted layer already exists, even on a clay soil, management options to hasten repair should be considered, e. g. tillage, deep ripping, sowing a ley pasture or sowing crop species more effective at repairing compacted soil...|$|E

40|$|Michigan {{is located}} in a wet-freeze climate zone. During winter the deicing-salt {{application}} is needed to melt snow on highways. Freezing {{in the presence of a}} deicing salt solution is considered a severe concrete exposure condition. Prolonged exposure in pavement joints has been found to erode the concrete binder material (portland cement paste) when coupled with its low internal frost resistance (i. e. insufficient air and poorly drained joints). This creates a weak zone resulting in joint spalling from <b>heavy</b> <b>wheel</b> loading. Many highways have been found to suffer this type of distress within ten years requiring expensive joint repairs. This research investigates the material level mechanisms for frost deterioration under deicing salt exposure by the aid of systematic application of various experimental techniques, such as sub-freezing length change measurement, micro- and macro-characterization of scaling properties and nitrogen sorption test. A new conceptual model is provided for the surface deterioration that occurs within a thin surface layer when exposed to a deicing salt solution. The major stress producing mechanism is ice-growth within the capillary pores exacerbated by cryogenic suction of the liquid brine present on the surface, thus feeding further ice-growth and leading to high tensile stresses in the direction of least internal restraint and “popping” of thin mortar flakes. This process repeats itself for every freeze-thaw cycle. These findings pave the way for the proposal of sorptivity as a performance-based criterion to evaluate scaling resistance in concrete and its theoretical nature is enhanced by a refined model capable of capturing the effect of pore size characteristics (pore volume, its size distribution and connectivity). This further leads to the identification and application of effective mitigation techniques, including reconfiguration of paste pore system towards a more refined and discontinued structure and utilization of a hydrophobic pore liner in the silicate substrate of hydration products as surface treatment...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 20 th Annual South African Transport Conference 16 - 20 July 2001 "Meeting the transport challenges in Southern Africa", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. In container ports pavements are subjected to ultra <b>heavy</b> <b>wheel</b> loads that may greatly exceed those of highway trucks, but often fewer repetitions are applied. These pavements are typically termed heavy duty pavements. The heavy duty pavement at the Transnet Container holding area at City Deep, Johannesburg had been in service for about 20 years and it showed severe cracking. The pavement was still serviceable and in operation, but rehabilitation or rebuilding {{had to be done}} in order to prevent the pavement from becoming unserviceable. The pavement consisted of a 300 mm concrete slab pavement and rebuilding of this pavement was an option, but it involved high expenditure. As the existing concrete pavement had severe block cracking, and in some areas even crocodile cracking, a concrete slab overlay would require a slab of substantial thickness to rehabilitate the pavement. Concrete-filled geocells has shown substantial promise for new concrete pavements under ultra heavy loading conditions (Visser, 1999) and it was decided to investigate the suitability of these cells as a rehabilitation measure. The geocells, known as Hyson-Cells, offer three-dimensional interlocking cast in-situ blocks. It further offers resistance to slew caused by turning movements of heavy vehicles as well as resistance to the point loads of stacked containers. Hyson-Cells differs from interlocking pavements in that it is cast in-situ and that interlocking takes place in a three dimensional direction. Models explaining the three dimensional interaction between the blocks are very complex and the structural and functional contribution of such an overlay can best be investigated by experimental techniques.

40|$|AbstractAs {{observed}} {{previously in}} rowing, kayaking an ergometer {{becomes more and}} more popular. Nowadays, indoor kayak championships are organized performed on ergometer designed with a fixed footrest-seat complex. The main goal when one designs ergometers is to reproduce as closest as possible the on-water conditions. The reliability with on-water condition is usually assessed using both physiological and kinematics parameters. The previous studies of our research group have shown that the dynamics of the in situ movement has also to be reproduced. In other words, major muscular groups (who generated the joint torque and by the way the contact forces) involved in kayaking should be recruit with the same timing during on-water and ergometer kayaking. At the 7 th ISEA conference, our research group presented a method based on numerical optimization to design a kayak ergometer equipped with a sliding footrest-seat complex that reproduces the acceleration generated in flatwater kayak. Based on these preliminary results, we have constructed a new ergometer. Then, {{the purpose of this study}} was to present the last developments performed on this ergometer and preliminary 3 D kinematics analysis from elite kayakers. The characteristics (stiffness and damping) of the bungee cord linking the back of the frame with the trolley were determined using our previous results. An air brake, composed of a flywheel with a <b>heavy</b> <b>wheel</b> and two freewheel-pulleys on a shaft, simulated the water drag on the blades. However, a magnetic brake was added for specific training sessions. The paddle was linked to the pulleys by two ropes. Each side of the frame is equipped with one slide (1 dof in translation) in order to always keep the directions of the ropes parallel to the long axis of the ergometer whatever the instant of the cycle. First trials performed with elite athlete showed the robustness of all the mechanisms developed. 3 D kinematic analysis showed the relevance of the adding slides when compared with on-water paddle trajectories observed during the propulsion phase. An instrumentation (3 D force sensors at each contact) coupled with a specific interface that allows real time feedback is under development. This innovative ergometer will be used to collect dynamic and kinematic parameters. They will serve as input data of our simulator in order to carry out intra-athlete comparisons and to still improve the design of kayak ergometers...|$|E
