Introduction: Physiologically the blood may be considered simply as a medium of exchange, collecting the tissue forming elements from the lungs and the assimilated products of the digestion of the food, distributing these to the various tissues of the body there to be made use of in the anabolic changes, and in turn collecting the products of catabolism to carry these to the liver and the excretory organs [...] skin, kidneys, lungs and possibly the bowels. Histologically it may {{be considered as a}} tissue composed of colorless blood cells and red blood cells, floating in a liquid, the blood plasma. The colorless cells originate in lymphoid tissue and in bone marrow. There are several varieties of colorless cells recognized, which includes the following: 1. Small lymphocytes, about {{the same size as the}} red cell and containing a relatively large nucleus. This variety probably originates wholly within lymphoid tissue. 2. Large mononuclear leucocytes, three times as large as the red cells and containing a nucleus. 3. Transitional leucocytes representing a more advanced stage of development, and containing a nucleus often kidney shaped or <b>indented.</b> <b>4.</b> Polynucleur leucocytes. This is the form found most abundand and represents the fully developed leucocyte. This variety is recognized by the distorted nucleus...|$|R
40|$|The {{interfacial}} force microscope (IFM) {{was used}} to indent and image defect free Au(111) surfaces, providing atomic-scale observations of the onset of pileup and the excursion of material above the initial surface plane. Images and load-displacement measurements demonstrate that elastic accommodation of an indenter is followed by two stages of plasticity. The initial stage is identified by slight deviations of the load-displacement relationship from the predicted elastic response. Images acquired after indentations showing only this first stage indicate that these slight load relaxation events result in residual indentations 0. 5 to 4 nm deep with no evidence of pileup or surface orientation dependence. The second stage of plasticity {{is marked by a}} series of dramatic load relaxation events and residual indentations tens of nanometers deep. Images acquired following this second stage document 0. 25 nm pileup terraces which reflect the crystallography of the surface as well as the indenter geometry. Attempts to plastically displace the <b>indenter</b> <b>4</b> - 10 nanometers deep into the Au(111) surface were unsuccessful, demonstrating that the transition from stage I to stage H plasticity is associated with overcoming some sort of barrier. Stage I is consistent with previously reported models of dislocation nucleation. The dramatic load relaxations of stage II plasticity, and the pileup of material above the surface, require cross-slip and appear to reflect a dynamic process leading to dislocation intersection with the surface. The IFM measurements reported here offer new insights into the mechanisms underlying the very early stages of plasticity and the formation of pileup...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to determine irradiation effects on the nanoindentation plastic zone morphology in a model Fe– 9 %Cr ODS alloy. Specimens are irradiated to 50 displacements per atom at 400 °C with Fe++ self-ions or to 3 dpa at 500 °C with neutrons. The as-received specimen is also studied as a control. The nanoindentation plastic zone size is calculated using two approaches: (1) an analytical model based on the expanding spherical cavity analogy, and (2) finite element modeling (FEM). Plastic zones in all specimen conditions extend radially outward from the <b>indenter,</b> ∼ <b>4</b> – 5 times the tip radius, indicative of fully plastic contact. Non-negligible plastic flow in the radial direction requires the experimentalist to consider the plastic zone morphology when nanoindenting ion-irradiated specimens; a single nanoindent may sample non-uniform irradiation damage, regardless of whether the indent is made top-down or in cross-section. Finally, true stress-strain curves are generated...|$|R

Putative single pass transmembrane proteins were identified using the combined signal peptide and TMD prediction program Phobius (Kall et al., 2004). A hydrophobicity-scanning algorithm (Sharpe et al., unpublished) was used to refine the transmembrane boundaries of proteins predicted to have type I or type III topology (i. e. periplasmic N-terminus). The approximate edges from Phobius were <b>indented</b> by <b>4</b> amino acids at both ends and a window of five residues was used to scan for mean hydrophobicity using the Goldman-Engelman-Steitz hydrophobicity scale (Engelman et al., 1986) {{which is the most}} appropriate hydrophobicity scale for amino acids in single pass transmembrane regions (Koehler et al., 2009).

40|$|Objective: Objectives of {{this study}} were to (1) {{quantify}} the immediate effect of Nimmo technique on muscle elasticity, pain perception, and disability and (2) evaluate comparative effectiveness of treating all primary and secondary trigger points (TrPs) vs primary TrP only. Methods: Fourteen chronic low back pain subjects recruited from a chiropractic college were tested in this within-day repeated-measures design study. Gluteus medius containing a prominent TrP was <b>indented</b> for <b>4</b> sessions using a mechanoacoustic indentor system. A finite element optimization method extracted hyperelastic material constants of the gluteus medius. Load-deformation response on a standardized block was simulated. Area under the load-deformation curve from 0 % to 25 % deformation (A FE) and force at 25 % deformation (F FE) were determined. No treatment was applied {{between the first and second}} sessions. Only the primary TrP in gluteus medius was treated between the second and third sessions. Full Nimmo treatment was used between the third and fourth sessions requiring treatment of all primary and secondary TrPs. The A FE, F FE, tissue thickness, subjective pain, and Oswestry Disability Index were compared between sessions. Results: After full Nimmo treatment, A FE and F FE were significantly smaller than baseline (P =. 021 and. 027, respectively) and focal TrP treatment only (P =. 003 and. 001, respectively). The changes accompanied concomitant improvement in subjective pain and disability. It appears that focal TrP treatment resolves TrP, but full Nimmo treatment further reduces electrogenic spasm. Conclusions: Immediate effect of a single full Nimmo treatment appears to reduce muscle tone, subjective pain, and disability and be more beneficial than focal TrP treatment.

40|$|Static load {{capacity}} {{is a critical}} design parameter for rolling element bearings used in space mechanisms {{because of the potential}} for Brinell (surface dent) damage due to shock and vibration loading events during rocket launch. Brinell damage to bearing raceways can lead to torque variations (noise) and reduced bearing life. The growing use of ceramic rolling elements with high stiffness in hybrid bearings exacerbates the situation. A new family of hard yet resilient materials based upon nickel-titanium is emerging to address such bearing challenges. 60 NiTi is a superelastic material that simultaneously exhibits high hardness and a relatively low elastic modulus (~ 100 GPa) and has been shown to endure higher indentation loads than conventional and high performance steel. Indentation {{load capacity}} has been reported for relatively large (12. 7 mm diameter) ceramic (Si 3 N <b>4)</b> <b>indenter</b> balls pressed against flat plates of 60 NiTi. In order to develop damage load threshold criteria applicable {{to a wide range of}} bearing designs and sizes, the effects of indenter ball radius and the accuracy of interpolation of the Hertz contact stress relations for 60 NiTi must be ascertained. In this paper, results of indentation tests involving ceramic balls ranging from 6. 4 to 12. 7 mm in diameter and highly polished 60 NiTi flat plates are presented. When the resulting dent depth data for all the indenter ball sizes are normalized using the Hertz equations, the data (dent depth vs. stress) are comparable. Thus when designing bearings made from 60 NiTi, the Hertz stress relations can be applied with relative confidence over a range of rolling element sizes and internal geometries...|$|R
40|$|The {{definitions}} {{and types of}} measurement of hardness are reviewed with special reference to the static indentation test. The present state {{of the theory of}} static indentation hardness testing of metals is described, together with previous measurements of the distortions of metal surfaces caused by indenting. Multiple beam interferometry is employed to measure the surface distortions. The apparatus and techniques employed, which include the application of multilayer dielectric films to the interferometrie study of metal surfaces, are described. The specific aspects of the surface distortions studied are: (1) Flow pattern shape, with special reference to the transition from ridging to sinking impressions, and variations due to the geometric shape of the indentation. (2) Volume of the flow pattern. This is found to be smaller than the volume of the indentation for all the indentations studied. Possible explanations of this discrepancy are discussed. (3) Shallowing or elastic recovery of ball indentations. The shallowing of ball indentations {{in a wide range of}} metals is studied, and its variation with load, hardness, and <b>indenter</b> is analysed. (<b>4)</b> The shape of recovered ball indentations. Shallow ball indentations are found to be not strictly spherical, in contrast to deeper ball indentations. Measures of their deviation from sphericity are proposed and an explanation of these deviations is discussed. (5) Critical specimen size. The mode of deformation occurring when a hardness test indentation is made near to the edge of the specimen is studied. The results are compared with the mode of deformation for wedge indentations in ideal and real metals. On the basis of the results a fuller description of the processes involved in ball hardness tests is possible. The surface distortions from the onset of plasticity to the fully plastic stage are described in detail, and support Tabor's theory of ball indentation. The treatment of the hardness test as predominantly a problem in plasticity is justified. <p...|$|R
