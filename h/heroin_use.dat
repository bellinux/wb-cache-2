40|$|The {{aim of this}} study, was to {{determining}} {{the effects of the}} <b>heroin</b> <b>used</b> in Iran that there has been no study on this subject on fertility indices in mice (Balb/c); These factors include sperm motility, sperm viability, daily sperm production, epididymal sperm reserve, serum testosterone concentration, body weight, testis weight and gonado-somatic index. For this study a total number of 177 mice (105 male and 72 female) were used. The male mice were divided into 5 groups (3 control and 2 experimental). From each group 3 male were chosen for fertility rate. Different experimental groups of heroin-dependant mice (50 mg kg - 1 IP for 3 days, twice daily), were divided into two groups. One of which received heroin with a dose of 5 mg kg - 1, IP and the other 5 mg mL - 1, IP twice daily for a period of 40 days. The Results showed that the <b>heroin</b> <b>used</b> in Iran could exert a significant effect on the sperm motility, sperm viability and serum testosterone concentration; Also significant changes in the body weight, testis weight and fertility were observed; But no significant changes in the daily sperm production, epididymal sperm reserve and gonado-somatic index were seen. The data suggests that the <b>heroin</b> <b>used</b> in Iran could affect some of the spermatogenesis functions...|$|R

25|$|Intravenous {{drug use}} {{represents}} {{the largest single}} cause of HIV transmission in China, accounting for 44.3% of infections {{at the end of}} 2005. Ministry of Public Security data suggests that the number of registered drug users has risen steadily {{at a rate of about}} 122% per year, from 70,000 in 1990 to 1.16 million in 2005. The total number, including unregistered drug users, is thought to be much higher, with one estimate placing the figure at 3.5 million; the UNODC World Drug Report estimated that in 2003, 0.2% of 16- to 64-year-olds (i.e., 1.7 million people) were opiate abusers. The most commonly used drug is heroin, which accounts for 85% of total reported drug use, although amphetamines are becoming more common, especially in urban areas. Many drug users begin <b>heroin</b> <b>use</b> by smoking, but later find it more cost effective to inject because of the stronger effect gained from injecting a smaller amount. Sharing injection equipment is common.|$|E
25|$|A {{large body}} of {{international}} research has shown the efficacy of methadone maintenance treatment programmes {{for the treatment of}} drug addiction and subsequent reduction in HIV risk behaviors. In acknowledgment of this evidence, in 2004 the Chinese government called for the use of such practices to mitigate HIV transmission. Immediately, under the governance of the Ministries of Health and Public Security and the State Food and Drug Administration, a pilot study of eight clinics in five provinces was done. Inclusion in the programme required: (1) several failed attempts to quit the use of heroin, (2) at least two terms in a detoxification centre, (3) age at least 20 years, (4) being a registered local resident of the area in which the clinic is located, and (5) being of good civil character. Those testing HIV positive need only fulfill criteria 4 and 5. To monitor the progress of the clinics, a database was established to gather data on demographics, medical issues, drug use, and other information about the patients. These data were assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months, and indicated reductions in <b>heroin</b> <b>use,</b> drug-related crime, and unemployment in those who received methadone maintenance treatment.|$|E

During the shoot, Thunders held a doll in his arm as if to strike it against his guitar to add shock value.|$|E

Soon after leaving, Silver formed his own long-term quintet, after receiving offers of work from club owners who had heard his albums. The first line-up was Mobley (tenor saxophone), Farmer (trumpet), Watkins (bass), and Louis Hayes (drums). The quintet, with various line-ups, continued to record, helping Silver to build his reputation. He wrote almost all of the material they played, and, in concert, he [...] "won over the crowds through his affable personality and all-action approach.

500|$|To {{promote the}} release of Cyberpunk, Idol began the 1993 No Religion Tour. The title of the tour came from a lyric in the album's first track, [...] "Wasteland", which {{described}} a man travelling through a dystopia. In keeping with the album's theme, the performance stages were set to a computerised, high-tech aesthetic. Idol wished to use Blendo imagery on massive television screens behind the stage to rapidly shift {{in time with the}} music. Some of the video and photography was shot by Idol and Brett Leonard, including photos of Idol during acupuncture, himself at a spa, various LA landscapes, and imagery which referenced <b>heroin</b> <b>use.</b> An engineer on stage, whom Idol fashioned as another band member, would be charged with altering the images in rhythm with the music, as though it were also an instrument. Multiple engineers with video equipment would also roam the audience, beaming images of the crowd onto the screen as well, creating an interactive show. The tour took place in Europe, performing a total of 19 shows in 18 cities across 11 countries. It began on 18 August 1993 in Berlin, and concluded on 20 September 1993 in London.|$|E

40|$|Background: Heroin {{is one of}} the opiates {{which is}} used, as the most {{addictive}} drugs, in Iran. Considering the damaging effects of these drugs on the health of opiate addicts, investigation on the effects of <b>heroin</b> <b>used</b> in Iran, on male genital indicators including daily sperm production and its development, which has an essential role in fertility, seems to be necessary. Materials and Methods: A total of 70 Bulb/c mature male mice, were divided into 5 groups of control, [intact (n= 10), sham I (n= 10) sham II (n= 10) ] and experimental groups [I (n= 20), II (n= 20], and 50 days after addiction to heroin (50 mg/kg) via intra peritoneal injection (IP), 6 mice from each groups were selected and after euthenizing, the testes and epididymes were removed. The rate of daily sperm production (DSP), epididymic sperm preservation (ESP) and the rate of sperm motility were measured accurately. Results: In the study of the effect of heroin on daily sperm production and sperm preservation between the control and experimental groups, no significant differences were observed. The effect of heroin on sperm motility between control and experimental groups, the difference were significant (P< 0 / 05). Conclusions: In this survey, it was indicated that, the <b>heroin</b> <b>used</b> in Iran, causes a decrease in healthy sperms of mice their motility, and consequently can affect on genital indicators...|$|R

Although Holzman {{was pleased with the}} album, Nico's longevity with the label was unlikely; he was increasingly concerned with her <b>heroin</b> <b>use</b> and she had a difficult, irresponsible attitude. Nico left the United States before she was officially released from Elektra, after a violent incident in a New York City bar. Biographers refer to her leaving the U.S. as an exile; Nico said, [...] "When you live in a dangerous place, you also become increasingly dangerous. You might just wind up in jail." [...] In London she recorded two more albums with Cale in the same vein: Desertshore (1970) and The End... (1974), now considered parts of a trilogy. The album was reissued as a CD in 1991 with two bonus tracks. Songs off The Marble Index have been included in Nico compilations, including The Classic Years (1998), Femme Fatale (2002), and The Frozen Borderline – 1968–1970 (2007).

For a long time, he focused on painting, producing 4-track recordings he had made while working on Blood Sugar Sex Magik, and writing short stories and screenplays. To cope with his worsening depression, Frusciante increased his <b>heroin</b> <b>use</b> and spiraled into a life-threatening dependency. His use of heroin to medicate his depression was a clear decision: [...] "I was very sad, and I was always happy when I was on drugs; therefore, I should be on drugs all the time.

[...] Although Lennon and McCartney denied any drug-related interpretation of the song at the time, McCartney later suggested that the line was deliberately written to ambiguously refer to either illicit drugs or sexual activity. The meaning of [...] "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" [...] became the subject of speculation, as many believed that the song's title was code for the hallucinogenic drug LSD. The BBC banned the track on those grounds. They also banned [...] "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!"
