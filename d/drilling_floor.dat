50|$|Slips is {{a device}} used to grip {{and hold the}} upper part of a drill string to the <b>drill</b> <b>floor</b> on an oil rig. The slips are {{constructed}} as a collection of metal wedges, hinged together to form a circular shape around the drill pipe. On the inside surface, the slips normally has replaceable steel teeth that grips the pipe. The outsides of the slips are tapered and meets a similar taper on the <b>drill</b> <b>floor.</b> Usually the pipe goes through a Rotary table - machinery that makes the pipe rotate.|$|R

50|$|Originally {{the term}} {{was used in the}} {{traveling}} carnivals of 19th-century United States, almost interchangeably with roustabout. By the 1930s the terms had transferred to the oil drilling industry. In the United Kingdom's oil industry starting in the 1970s, roughneck specifically meant those who worked on the <b>drill</b> <b>floor</b> of a <b>drilling</b> rig handling specialised drilling equipment for drilling and pressure controls. In practice, these workers ranged from unskilled to highly skilled, depending subjectively on the individual worker's aptitude and experience. By contrast, a roustabout would perform general labor, such as loading and unloading cargo from crane baskets and assisting welders, mechanics, electricians and other skilled workers. The word roughneck was in use in the U.S. oil drilling industry even earlier and had a similar meaning.|$|R
50|$|Tracking and {{recording}} of drill pipe at the rig site starts when individual joints are picked up. Joint numbers are manually {{marked on the}} side of the pipe. Typically three sections of pipe are joined together into a stand (of about 27-29 m in length) and stacked in rows of 10, with their base resting on the <b>drill</b> <b>floor.</b> Prior to running in the hole each stand is manually measured with a steel tape measure and the measurement recorded in a computer spreadsheet (previously a pipe tally book was used) alongside the stand number. To confirm at any stage what depth the drill bit is operating at, the driller consults the pipe tally records, and measures the length of the current stand of drill pipe below the rig floor.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{critical}} phases when drilling from a floating drilling rig in terms of down hole, is pipe connection. During this procedure the conventional heave compensation is not operational as the drill string is climbed to the <b>drill</b> <b>floor.</b> Consequently the <b>drill</b> bit functions as a piston creating large pressure variations in the drill bit pressure. To control this pressure and create disturbance attention a linear model predictive controller with feedback linearisztion is created using feedback linearization. This controller shows promising results when feedforward with future predictions is applied. Without future predictions the results are the same as for an MPC without feedforward. Because only the topside pressure is known the rest of the states are estimated using a Kalman filter, which shows good results on the state estimations. To make the system more applicable in real life applications an efficient linear model predictive controller implementation was created for a PLC with great results, both in terms of calculation time and memory usage. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{motions of}} a semi-submersible {{drilling}} platform {{have been evaluated}} so as to predict the effects on the comfort and activities of the crew. The horizontal motions at the <b>drill</b> <b>floor</b> exceeded the 'average threshold of perception' defined in International Standard 6897 (ISO 6897, 1984) {{by more than a}} factor of two; they were about half of the limit for the worst 10 min in five years for 'fixed offshore structures where work of a somewhat critical nature is carried out'. Other standards predict that the vertical motion would cause vomiting due to motion sickness in less than 5 % of unadapted adults within the first 8 h of exposure. The calculated probability of 'motion-induced interruptions' (loss-of-balance events) caused by deck motion was negligible. Notwithstanding the above conclusions, it is considered that current standards are insufficient to predict the effects of the motions of ships and floating platforms on the activities of the crew. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background Noise {{exposure}} {{is one of}} the most important problems in workplaces and general environments. Noise exposures can have both auditory and non-auditory health effects. Objectives The aim of this study was to determine the noise exposure levels in oil <b>drilling</b> rig <b>floor</b> and camp facilities in Ahvaz, Iran. Materials and Methods This was a cross-sectional study. Environmental and personal noise exposure measurements were carried out by the method established by ISO- 9612 with a sound level meter and noise level dosimeter. Results All the measurements were performed in two parts of an oil drilling rig: the operation area and the camp area. The noise levels in 100 points in the rig area were between 54 - 110 dB. The noise levels were also measured in 38 points in the camp area and ranged between 52 - 100 dB. Conclusions Our results showed that only 17 % of the measured points in the oil <b>drilling</b> rig <b>floor</b> were in safe area; 39 % were in caution area and 44 % were in danger area. In the camp facilities area, 51 % of the points were in safe area, 38 % were in caution area and 11 % in danger area. The main sources of noise exposure in the rig floor area were power generators...|$|R
5000|$|Because wells are {{not always}} drilled vertically, there may be two [...] "depths" [...] for every given point in a wellbore: the {{measured}} depth (MD) measured along {{the path of the}} borehole, and the true vertical depth (TVD), the absolute vertical distance between the datum and the point in the wellbore. In perfectly vertical wells, the TVD equals the MD; otherwise, the TVD is less than the MD measured from the same datum. Common datums used are ground level (GL), <b>drilling</b> rig <b>floor</b> (DF), rotary table (RT), kelly bushing (KB) and mean sea level (MSL).|$|R
5000|$|In the 1880s, {{several states}} formed [...] "naval militias", the {{forerunners}} of present-day Navy and Marine Corps Reserve units. Michigan formed the Michigan Naval Militia in 1893; the militia {{quickly became a}} popular pastime for wealthy Detroiters. Even so, the militia fought in both the Spanish-American War and World War I. By 1929, over 600 men {{were part of the}} militia, and it had outgrown its existing headquarters. Captain Richard Thorton Brodhead convinced the Michigan state legislature to construct a new building. The state of Michigan and the city of Detroit pooled $375,000 to build a new armory on Jefferson near the foot of the Belle Isle bridge.The new armory opened in 1930, and was used as both a training facility and civic event site. The indoor <b>drill</b> <b>floor</b> was used for dances, USO mixers, auto shows, and political and sporting events. In 1932, future heavyweight champion Joe Louis fought his first career bout. Between May 1936 and 1939, improvements were made to the facility by the Works Progress Administration, a New Deal agency that provided employment and created public works projects throughout the United States during the Great Depression. The extensive remodeling and expansion project included a basement motorpool and gymnasium; enlargement of the third floor, to add an officer's wardroom, mess hall and kitchen; and a fourth-floor penthouse wing to accommodate visiting officers.|$|R

40|$|In March 2007 the sea <b>floor</b> <b>drill</b> rig MeBo (short for “Meeresboden-Bohrgerät”, ‘sea <b>floor</b> <b>drill</b> rig’ in German) {{returned}} from a 17 -day scientific cruise with the new German research vessel Maria S. Merian. Four sites between 350 m and 1700 m water depth were sampled at the continental slope off Morocco by push coring and rotary drilling. Up to 41. 5 -m-long sediment cores were recovered from Miocene, Pliocene, and Pleistocene marls. MeBo bridges the gap between conventional sampling methods from standard multipurpose research vessels (gravity corer, piston corer, dredges) and drill ships. Most bigger research vessels {{will be able to}} support deployment of the MeBo. Since the drill system can be easily transported within 20 -ft containers, worldwide operation from vessels of opportunity is possible.

40|$|Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 343, {{named the}} Japan Trench Fast Drilling Project (JFAST), <b>drilled</b> ocean <b>floor</b> {{boreholes}} through the fault {{zone of the}} 2011 Tōhoku-Oki earthquake (M 9. 0) to enhance understanding of the rupture process and tsunami generation. This project investigated the very large fault slip that caused the devastating tsunami by making borehole stress measurements, sampling the plate boundary fault zone, and taking temperature measurements across the fault zone. The {{results show that the}} earthquake rupture occurred in a narrow fault zone (< 5 m). Based on both laboratory experiments on fault zone material and temperature monitoring of the fault zone, we show that the fault had very low friction during the earthquake. The low friction properties of the fault zone might be attributed to high smectite clay content of the sediment. These physical and frictional characteristics contributed to the unusually large fault slip that occurred during the earthquake and generated the tsunami. © 2014 by The Oceanography Society.

40|$|The sea <b>floor</b> <b>drill</b> rig MeBo (acronym for Meeresboden-Bohrgerät, German for sea <b>floor</b> <b>drill</b> rig) is {{a robotic}} drill rig that is {{deployed}} {{on the sea}} floor and operated remotely from the research vessel to drill up to 80 m into the sea floor. It was developed at the MARUM Research Center for Marine Environmental Sciences at Bremen University. The complete system – comprising the drill rig, winch, control station, and the launch and recovery system – is transported in six containers and can be deployed worldwide from German and international research ships. It was the first remote-controlled deep sea drill rig to use a wireline coring technique. Compared to drilling vessels this technology {{has the advantage of}} operating from a stable platform at the sea bed, which allows for optimal control over the drilling process. Especially for shallow drillings in the range of tens to hundreds of metres, sea bed drill rigs are time-efficient since no drill string has to be assembled from the ship to the sea floor before the first core can be taken. The MeBo has been successfully operated, retrieving high-quality cores at the sea bed for a variety of research fields, including slope stability studies and palaeoclimate reconstructions.

40|$|Master's thesis in Industrial economicsThe author have {{designed}} this thesis {{to give the}} reader detailed knowledge about wired drill pipe technology (WDP technology). Focusing on providing the reader with unbiased examples and explanations have been of top priority. The optimal result being that the reader will be able to, with only little or none prior knowledge about WDP technology, fully understand the WDP technology’s economics and technical aspects. Wired drill pipe technology (WDP technology) {{is becoming more and}} more known to the oil industry. WDP provides wired communication with downhole tools, instead of conventional wireless communicating-methods like mud pulse telemetry (MPT) and electromagnetic telemetry (EMT). Up to this point, this new and sophisticated technology have been used to drill more than 120 wells worldwide. The technology have been around for some time, but have in later years gained more attention from oil companies, especially the companies regularly drilling highly challenging fields. This thesis gives a close examination of all the technical parts of the technology. Looks closer upon the transmission speed. How the telemetry works and the route between surface equipment and all the way down to the bottom hole assembly (BHA). The thesis also closely examines the economics of the technology and relate this to the cost of drilling operations offshore in the North Sea. New technology provide new possibilities, but they often tend to have a steep price tag. This thesis examines if the additional cost of wired pipe is worth the investment. It also provides calculations from two different example-wells, and the results from these calculations clearly states the cost of WDP. The use of WDP technology provide multiple new options in regards of communication with different sensors. Since there now is a constant dataflow, from the <b>drill</b> <b>floor</b> and down to downhole tools, you have the opportunity to place sensors along the string. These sensors are more commonly known as Along String Measurements or ASMs for short. The ASMs will play an important role within the development of automated drilling rigs. The combination of wired drill pipe network, the ASMs and automated drilling computers are closer examined as well. The WDP technology is not only saving time during the drilling operation, but it also makes the drilling operation safer for the personnel involved. The technology shows strong resilience, but still have a few weak spots that needs further improvement...|$|R
