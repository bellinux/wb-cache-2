40|$|The Kimberly ultramarathon was {{a tragic}} {{incident}} in which a bushfire trapped and severely injured five athletes. Rasmussen’s [1] risk management framework and accompanying Accimap method {{have been shown to}} be appropriate for understanding adverse events in a range of areas, including outdoor recreation [2, 3]. This paper presents an Accimap analysis of the Kimberly ultramarathon incident, which in turn is used to examine whether Rasmussen’s framework is appropriate in the extreme sports event context. The analysis shows that features of the ultramarathon incident are consistent with Rasmussen’s [1] model of accident causation in sociotechnical systems. The incident was caused by multiple, interacting factors across the wider sporting event system. Moreover, the characteristics of the incident were found to map onto the key tenets of accident causation described by Rasmussen. This article demonstrates that systems <b>accident</b> <b>analysis</b> methods are appropriate for examining extreme sporting event incidents. Specifically, the Accimap demonstrates the systems approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of the causal relationships between factors involved in the Kimberly ultramarathon fire. The implications for the design and delivery of extreme sports events are discussed 1. Rasmussen, J., Risk management in a dynamic society: A modelling problem.

This paper shows how the bow-tie representation can also be appropriate for experience learning. It describes how a pharmaceutical production plant uses bow-ties for <b>incident</b> and <b>accident</b> <b>analysis.</b> Two levels of bow-ties are constructed: standard bow-ties concern generic risks of the plant whereas local bow-ties represent accident scenarios specific to each workplace. When <b>incidents</b> or <b>accidents</b> are analyzed, knowledge that is gained is added to existing local bow-ties. Regularly, local bow-ties that have been updated are compared to standard bow-ties in order to revise them. Knowledge on safety at the global and at local levels is hence {{as accurate as possible}} and memorized in a real time framework. As it relies on the communication between safety experts and local operators, this use of the bow-ties contributes therefore to organizational learning for safety...|$|R

Despite dramatic improvements in surgical safety knowledge, {{at least half of the}} adverse events occur during surgical care. Human failures (for example, miscommunication, teamwork breakdown, leadership and poor decision making) are not uncommon and often lead to errors in surgery.

40|$|As {{part of our}} {{co-operation}} {{with the}} Telecommunication Agency of the Netherlands, we want to formulate an <b>accident</b> <b>analysis</b> method and model for use in incidents in telecommunications that cause service unavailability. In order to not re-invent the wheel, we wanted to first get an overview of all existing <b>accident</b> <b>analysis</b> methods and models {{to see if we}} could find an overarching method and commonalities between models. Furthermore, we wanted to find any methods that had been applied to incidents in telecommunication networks or even been designed specifically for these incidents. In this article, we present a systematic literature review of <b>incident</b> and <b>accident</b> <b>analysis</b> methods across domains. We find that <b>accident</b> <b>analysis</b> methods have experienced a rise in attention over the last 15 years, leading to a plethora of methods. We discuss the three classes in which they are often categorized. We find that each class has its own advantages and disadvantages: an analysis using a sequential method may be easier to understand and communicate and quicker to execute, but may miss vital underlying causes that can later trigger new, similar <b>accidents.</b> An <b>analysis</b> using an epidemiological method takes more time, but it also finds underlying causes the resolution of which may prevent accidents from happening in the future. Systemic methods are appropriate for complex, tightly coupled systems and executing such a method takes a lot of time and resources, rendering it very expensive. This will often not be justified by the costs of the accident (especially in telecommunications networks) and it will therefore be too expensive to be employed in regular businesses. We were not able to find any published definitions of structured methods specific to telecommunications, nor did we find any applications of structured methods specifically to telecommunications...|$|R
40|$|Human {{reliability}} is {{a crucial}} element in ensuring plant performance during an emergency condition. This is even more true as technology has been evolving exponentially in recent times. In fact, {{it is evident that}} technological developments imply a decrease of accidents owing to the use of redundancy and protection. But at the same time, the high technology complexity requires a sophisticated safety management systems and a high level of safety culture. The classical approaches are not sufficient to prevent the occurrence of extraordinary <b>incidents</b> and <b>accidents</b> in which the key element is represented by the 'human factor'. Thus, in this context, it is necessary to face the problem considering the human factor in an holistic way as the causation of several <b>incidents</b> and <b>accidents.</b> The <b>analysis</b> of human factors constitutes a highly interdisciplinary field of study not yet well defined. This paper deals with various aspects of human behaviour that can influence operator reliability. The aim of the research is to propose a novel methodological approach to simulate human errors in emergency condition. The new model is based on an integration of fuzzy cognitive maps techniques and analytic hierarchy process (AHP), a multi-criteria technique for organising and analysing complex decisions...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{has shown}} that the concept of {{constraint}} management is instrumental in understanding the domains of command and control and aviation safety. Particularly, functional modeling as a means to address constraint management provides a basis for analyzing the performance of socio-technical systems. In addition to the theoretical underpinnings, six studies are presented.           First, a functional analysis of an exercise conducted by a team of electricity network emergency managers is used to show that a team function taxonomy can be used to analyze the mapping between team tasks and information and communication technology to assess training needs for performance improvement. Second, an analysis of a fire-fighting emergency management simulation is used to show that functional modeling and visualization of constraints can describe behavior vis-à-vis constraints and inform decision support design. Third, analysis of a simulated adversarial command and control task reveals that functional modeling may be used to describe and facilitate constraint management (constraining the adversary and avoiding being constrained by the adversary).           Studies four and five address the domain of civil aviation safety. The analysis of functional resonance is applied to an incident in study four and an accident in study five, based on investigation reports. These studies extend the functional resonance <b>analysis</b> method and <b>accident</b> model. The sixth study documents the utility of this functional modeling approach for risk assessment by evaluating proposed automation for air traffic control, based on observations, interviews, and experimental data.           In sum, this thesis adds conceptual tools and modeling methods to the cognitive systems engineering discipline {{that can be used to}} tackle problems of training environment design, decision support, <b>incident</b> and <b>accident</b> <b>analysis,</b> and risk assessment...|$|R

40|$|Human Factors (HF) {{has long}} been {{identified}} {{as one of the}} main causes of <b>incidents</b> and <b>accidents</b> in the transportation industry, and more recently has become increasingly important in air accident investigation and safety improvement. As a result, many National Investigation Agencies (NIAs) are now explicitly acknowledging HF in their final investigation reports. Whereas engineering-and operations-led investigation can highlight what happened and how it occurred, it is increasingly recognised that the integration of HF into an investigation can help understand why a sequence of events led to an <b>incident</b> or <b>accident.</b> However, there are considerable challenges to more thorough integration of HF into air accident investigations. Most notably, there remains a reluctance amongst some NIAs to fully embrace HF and address potentially important HF issues in detail in their investigations. Consequently, there is a risk that some investigations are consistently overlooking potentially critical HF issues, and as a result fail to fully address why an <b>incident</b> or <b>accident</b> occurred. There is a need for research that examines these challenges, including the possible gap that exists between research and industry regarding the development and applicability of <b>accident</b> <b>analysis</b> tools, and that provides practical solutions to enable a better integration of HF in air accident investigations [...] .

40|$|The <b>accident</b> <b>analysis</b> of SBIRS {{program is}} {{conducted}} by gathering information for 15 years {{to understand the}} cause of the accident. The program had series of failures, workarounds were developed incrementally to solve the incidental problems over the years. This resulted in major failure in thermal vacuum testing. The architecture was reassessed, the new architecture so adopted was the wrong architecture. This is the accident this research has analyzed. The cause of the accident is analyzed thoroughly to understand the circumstances in which such an architecture was adopted. A System analysis of the environment was conducted to understand the accident circumstances and an <b>accident</b> <b>analysis</b> was conducted to understand the influence of the systemic failures of the wrong architectural decision which is the accident analyzed. A comparative study of <b>accident</b> <b>analysis</b> methodologies was undertaken to derive the best-suited method for <b>accident</b> <b>analysis.</b> A systemic <b>accident</b> <b>analysis</b> method STAMP, which analyses the accidents caused by the influence of the environment was considered as the best fit. The STAMP <b>accident</b> <b>analysis</b> method was adopted to understand the accident in detail. The <b>accident</b> <b>analysis</b> was performed based on the reports gathered from GAO, DOD and other sources and was confirmed for its completeness and accuracy from GAO. STPA process was adopted to conduct <b>accident</b> <b>analysis</b> in three stages – identifying control structures, changes in control structures and dynamic process model. STAMP <b>accident</b> <b>analysis</b> was improved by adding context as an additional factor. Accidents with context as {{the cause of the}} accident were analyzed to understand the possible solutions. The realization of the importance of context as accident cause was understood and the need to enhance the <b>accident</b> <b>analysis</b> model was realized. By adding context as part of the process that needs to be transferred to ensure successful completion was suggested. An organizational model that has been successful in assessing the accidents due to the context in the different domain was studied and was suggested to be adopted as preventive <b>accident</b> <b>analysis</b> model. Finally, the wrong architectural decision being the accident is contested and argued as the accident, as currently such decisions are not considered as an accident in the industry. This research has identified the cause of the accident to be the context in which organizations were operating. The solution suggested is to stabilize the context in one organization and replicate the stabilized context around the organizations involved in the program. The solution identifies contextual enhancement techniques used in health and safety management to build a positive culture in the organization. Thus this research has contributed towards analyzing the architectural failure in SBIRS program by identifying an <b>accident</b> <b>analysis</b> method that best suits the case study, applied the <b>accident</b> <b>analysis</b> to the case study to understand the cause of the accident. A recommendation of enhancing the factors in <b>accident</b> <b>analysis</b> was suggested and an accident prevention technique was recommended and a process to adopt this technique was suggested. This research has led to two further recommendations for future work. An architectural technique which would create the framework of components to prevent future architectural accidents such as this case study will be followed up. And a process to successfully pass the context in order to prevent accidents caused by organizational context will be taken further. This research is structured to understand the problem, analyze the problem using specific <b>accident</b> <b>analysis</b> methodology related to the domain detailing the accident, comparing different domains with the similar accident cause and finally recommending an accident prevention technique which had been successful in organizations...|$|R
