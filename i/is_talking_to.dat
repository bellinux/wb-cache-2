5|$|The Simpson {{family are}} busy {{preparing}} for Bart's birthday party. Homer sees a commercial on television for a prank microphone called the Superstar Celebrity Microphone {{that can be}} used to tap into localized AM radio systems and instantly decides to buy one for Bart. Subsequently, Bart experiences a crushingly disappointing birthday party when all his gifts turn out to be useless things like a cactus, a label maker, and a new suit. At first, he is also disappointed by the microphone, but later finds a use for it in creating practical jokes, such as tricking Ned's boys Rod and Todd into believing that God <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> them, listening in on Lisa and Janey's conversations about boys, and persuading Homer that Martians are invading the Earth.|$|E
5|$|Hartley {{explained}} that Arthur would {{be aware of}} his powers {{at the beginning of}} the series and would have no problem using them for personal gain. Hartley felt this played against the typical superheroes, because his character was not afraid to flaunt his abilities. Gough explained A.C. would be able to swim faster than humans, breathe underwater, as well as have super strength while underwater. He also stated that exposure to water on land would give him powers. The extent of his speed is shown in the pilot, when Arthur is able to keep up with a fighter jet flying above him. The extent of A.C.'s ability to breathe underwater was not elaborated upon, but he is seen swimming near the bottom of the ocean near the start of the pilot. When A.C. <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> Eva about releasing captive dolphins, he tells her that he felt as though the dolphins were somehow calling to him. In the comics, one of Aquaman's powers is the ability to communicate with sea life. Gough likened A.C.'s not having access to water to Clark's growing weak around kryptonite in Smallville – if A.C. does not get water, he will dehydrate and weaken. Water gives him a power boost and enables producers to explore stories on land.|$|E

5|$|Tales of the Black Freighter, {{a fictional}} comic within the Watchmen limited series, was adapted as a direct-to-video {{animated}} feature from Warner Premiere and Warner Bros. Animation, and released on March 24, 2009. It was originally {{included in the}} Watchmen script, but was changed from live-action footage to animation because of the $20 million {{it would have cost}} to film it in the stylized manner of 300 that Snyder wanted; this animated version, originally intended {{to be included in the}} final cut, was then cut because the film was already approaching a three-hour running time. Gerard Butler, who starred in 300, voices the Captain in the animated feature, having been promised a role in the live-action film that never materialized. Jared Harris voices his deceased friend Ridley, whom the Captain hallucinates <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> him. Snyder had Butler and Harris record their parts together. International rights to Black Freighter are held by Paramount.|$|E
