25|$|Some historians, {{including}} Wesley Fricks, Dan Holmes, and Charles Leerhsen have defended Cobb against unfair {{portrayals of}} him in popular culture since his death. A noted case is the book written by sportswriter Al Stump {{in the months after}} Cobb died in 1961. Stump was later discredited when it became known that he had stolen items belonging to Cobb and also betrayed the access Cobb gave him in his final months. As a result of the movie Cobb which starred Tommy Lee Jones, there are many myths surrounding Cobb's life, including one that he sharpened his spikes to inflict wounds to opposing players. Leerhsen's book Ty Cobb: A Terrible Beauty presents primary <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>contradiction</b> to some of the more negative charges against Cobb.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{global spread}} of the 2009 novel {{pandemic}} influenza A (H 1 N 1) virus led to the accelerated production and distribution of monovalent 2009 Influenza A (H 1 N 1) vaccines (pH 1 N 1). This pandemic provided the opportunity to evaluate the risk of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), which has been an influenza vaccine safety concern since the swine flu pandemic of 1976, using a common protocol among high and middle-income countries. The primary objective of this project was to demonstrate the feasibility and utility of global collaboration {{in the assessment of}} vaccine safety, including countries both with and without an established infrastructure for vaccine active safety surveillance. A second objective, included a priori, was to assess the risk of GBS following pH 1 N 1 vaccination. Methods: The primary analysis used the self-controlled case series (SCCS) design to estimate the relative incidence (RI) of GBS in the 42 days following vaccination with pH 1 N 1 vaccine in a pooled analysis across databases and in analysis using a meta-analytic approach. Results: We found a relative incidence of GBS of 2. 42 (95 % CI 1. 58 - 3. 72) in the 42 days following exposure to pH 1 N 1 vaccine in analysis of pooled data and 2. 09 (95 % CI 1. 28 - 3. 42) using the meta-analytic approach. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that international collaboration to evaluate serious outcomes using a common protocol is feasible. The significance and consistency of our findings support a conclusion of an association between 2009 H 1 N 1 vaccination and GBS. Given the rarity of the event the relative incidence found does not provide <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>contradiction</b> to international recommendations for the continued use of influenza vaccines.

5000|$|Around 1990, {{theoretical}} and experimental evidence has emerged that forces between charged particles suspended in dilute solutions of monovalent electrolytes might be attractive at larger distances. This <b>evidence</b> is <b>in</b> <b>contradiction</b> with the PB theory discussed above, which always predicts repulsive interactions in these situations. The theoretical treatment leading to these conclusions was strongly criticized. [...] The experimental findings were mostly based on video-microscopy, but the underlying data analysis was questioned concerning {{the role of}} impurities, appropriateness of image processing techniques, {{and the role of}} hydrodynamic interactions. The majority of the scientific community remains skeptical concerning such like-charge attractions and advocates the classical PB approach discussed above.|$|R
40|$|The palynological assemblages from Slovenian Middle Triassic {{sections}} and Susak More- 1 off-shore well always contain Permian, Scythian and Scythian-Lower Anisian palynomorphs. Middle Triassic palynomorphs were very rare (as in well SM- 1) and totally absent {{in almost all}} Slovenian sections strongly suggesting the possibility that in these sections the Permian palynomorphs were reworked into the Scythian-Lower Anisian deposits. This palynostratigraphical <b>evidence</b> was clearly <b>in</b> <b>contradiction</b> with the age {{of some of these}} chronostratigraphically well defined Slovenian Upper Anisian-Ladinian sections. As the siliciclastics in well SM- 1 are only palynostratigraphically controlled, the correlation with Slovenian sections is entirely based on palynological analogy. The palynological analogy of the Slovenian sections, Susak More- 1 off-shore well and palynostratigraphycally controlled Middle Triassic siliciclastics from off-shore well Maja- 1 (open sea side of the south Croatian Islands) indicates on a regionally extensive sedimentary realm which resulted from the aborted rifting during the Middle Triassic...|$|R
40|$|Ambitions {{for social}} {{mobility}} among rural southern Blacks and {{their influence on}} out-migration trends were explored in this analysis. Data utilized were collected {{as part of a}} more comprehensive study of living patterns among disadvantaged families. In the summer of 1970, samples of Black, female adults were drawn from 2 rural villages and a town of about 5, 000 inhabitants in a nonmetropolitan county of East Texas. The total sample numbered 52 village and 207 town homemakers. The data indicated that, in general, level of educational aspiration had little impact on desire for rural out-migration. It was observed that those desiring high levels of education (i. e., more than high school) were slightly more inclined to want to remain in the area. While differences were not statistically significant, this <b>evidence</b> was <b>in</b> direct <b>contradiction</b> with the original proposition that aspirations for higher education would be positively associated with rural out-migration. It was further concluded that, except for age and certainty of educational aspiration, family income and subjective income status had little influence on desire for out-migration. (HBC) ...|$|R

40|$|Drip {{irrigation}} {{is widely}} promoted {{as a means}} of saving water. In Morocco, where the current annual overdraft of aquifers is around 1 billion m 3 drip has been promoted, with subsidies as high as 100 %, {{as a means of}} both raising productivity and rural incomes and 'saving' over one billion of m 3. The paper shows that in the conditions of Morocco, drip tends to be associated with higher crop density, a shift to more water-intensive crops, and the reuse of 'saved water' to expand cultivated areas, resulting in higher water consumption. The Green Morocco Plan not only subsidizes conversion to drip but also the expansion of intensive farming, with an impact on water resources opposite to what is announced. We <b>evidence</b> <b>contradictions</b> <b>in</b> official discourses and policies and show how current policies undermine the resilience of irrigated agriculture to extreme drought events. Planning is carried out based on illusory local savings, disregards climate change projections, and runs against hydrologic realities that should be better accounted for through more elaborate water budgets...|$|R

40|$|Textbooks {{that teach}} history {{by the state}} are often {{indicative}} of the uses of the past {{by the state and}} are a key tool in the endeavour of nation-building. Textbooks and the nation are intimate with one another; textbooks being one {{of the ways in which}} to represent the type of nation that is projected by the state. But what if that projection itself is not consistent? How are the different projections seen in the textbooks, making them <b>evidence</b> of <b>contradictions</b> <b>in</b> the process of nation-building? This paper seeks to look at the contents of Malaysian state-approved history textbooks as indicative of nation projection. Certain key themes, actors, events, and frameworks in the 2003 edition of secondary school history textbooks will be mapped. <b>In</b> particular, the <b>contradictions</b> <b>in</b> the endeavour of nation building are our focus. While attempting to create a basis of inclusion, the textbooks also maintain exclusionary categories within the state cutting between citizens themselves. Basing the nation on the characteristics of Malay ethnicity, culture, language and religion, yet accounting for the presence of those that fall outside within a plural society framework, the push then is to project the nation as Malay, yet to explain the plural condition of Malaysian society. An internal contradiction arises when the nation is given certain characteristics, yet not everyone who is given membership in the nation shares those characteristics. As a conclusion to the paper, we will also point out that in providing a critique of the textbooks, such an analysis is also complicit in a simila...|$|R
