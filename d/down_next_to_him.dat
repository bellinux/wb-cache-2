500|$|The {{music video}} opens with Williams waking up {{on a couch}} next to an unnamed {{sleeping}} male and writes a note that says [...] "I'm sorry". From there she walks to a room and hugs her father, who's mentioned in song. A conversation ensues with Williams taking a photo of someone presumed to be her mother. The video continues with Williams in her room staring at the photo on a mirror, singing about how love, [...] "does not exist." [...] She moves through a costume closet and into a restaurant set, where a rotating cast of men pose as her date. Then into the next room, there's a wedding — everyone is wearing white (the other band members in attendance), but Williams comes dressed in black; she flees the scene from where the bride enters. During the chorus of the song, the clip cuts to the scenes where Williams is lying down on a giant pile of Valentine-themed cards. Throughout the video, clips of Williams singing {{with the rest of}} Paramore in a dim-lighted background are shown. In the video's final moments, Williams spots the same male she woke up to {{at the beginning of the}} video in the crowd at a rock show. After fantasizing of the two being together through all sets from the start of the video, she makes her way back through the various rooms to the original set in the beginning. When Williams sings [...] "And I'm on my way to believing", she returns to the couch where the male is still asleep, and hides the note she wrote in her pocket as she lies back <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

According to his brother Justus, the family became [...] "a scattered herd" [...] after his death, and Eeltsje wrote to Justus: [...] "I feel like a soldier who has seen his best comrade sink <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> on the field of battle." ...|$|E

6000|$|Her father {{lifted up}} his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw {{anything}} {{of which she}} chose to be insensible, gaily continued, [...] "Oh! mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should know it, and so I let <b>down</b> the side-glass <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, {{so that he might}} see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything." ...|$|R

2500|$|During {{the hour}} {{preceding}} the attack, 13 people including the shooter {{participated in the}} Bible study. [...] According to the accounts of people who talked to survivors, when the shooter walked into the historic African-American church, he immediately asked for Pinckney and sat <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> initially listening to others during the study. He started to disagree when they began discussing Scripture. Eventually, after waiting for the other participants to begin praying, {{he stood up and}} pulled a gun from a fanny pack, aiming it at 87-year-old Susie Jackson. Jackson's nephew, 26-year-old Tywanza Sanders, tried to talk him down and asked him why he was attacking churchgoers. The shooter responded, [...] "I have to do it. You rape our women and you're taking over our country. And you have to go." [...] When he expressed his intention to shoot everyone, Sanders dove in front of Jackson and was shot first. The suspect then shot the other victims, all the while shouting racial epithets. He also reportedly said, [...] "Y'all want something to pray about? I'll give you something to pray about." [...] He reloaded his gun five times. Sanders' mother and his five-year-old niece, both attending the study, survived the shooting by pretending to be dead.|$|E
60|$|The Vicar {{felt that}} the heavens had fallen. He sat {{crumpled}} up in his chair, a shattered man. Lady Hammergallow sat <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> without appearing to see him. She was breathing heavily, but her face was terribly calm. Everyone sat down. Was the Angel grossly ignorant or only grossly impertinent? The Angel was vaguely aware of some frightful offence, aware that in some mysterious way he had ceased to be {{the centre of the}} gathering. He saw reproachful despair in the Vicar's eye. He drifted slowly towards the window in the recess {{and sat down on the}} little octagonal Moorish stool by the side of Mrs Jehoram. And under the circumstances he appreciated at more than its proper value Mrs Jehoram's kindly smile. He put down the violin in the window seat.|$|E

50|$|I kind {{of thought}} that the big, standing, fist-in-the-air hero kind of thing was maybe a little too much. This is more modest. He is sitting there holding his hat and looking off in the {{direction}} of Skinner Butte. There is some public art that is not accessible or not very friendly. It seems to get ignored or walked past or spray-painted. I thought this would be a nice scale for kids. They could sit <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

Buddy was sitting there, waiting and down near ringside. All of a sudden, this guy comes in, and he sits <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> he's got a robe on it and everything.
