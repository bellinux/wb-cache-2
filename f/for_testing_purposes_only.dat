In an effort to provide a sound underpinning of an improved ASR planning framework, a review of 50 ASR projects {{from around the world}} was undertaken in order to provide fundamental data and lessons learned. First, existing published data was collected and collated. Published ASR data ranged from a brief project summary to extensive reports. Some published data were available for a total of 30 sites.

40|$|At {{submicron}} channel lengths, CMOS is {{an attractive}} alternative to silicon bipolar and GaAs MESFET technologies for use in wireless receivers. A 12 mW global positioning system (GPS) receiver front-end, comprising a low noise amplifier (LNA) and mixer implemented in a standard 0. 35 µm digital CMOS process, demonstrates the aptitude of CMOS for portable wireless appli-cations. A block diagram of the receiver front-end test is shown in Figure 1. The system consists of a LNA, mixer, buffer (<b>for</b> <b>testing</b> <b>purposes</b> <b>only),</b> and associated bias circuitry. Note that the LNA output and mixer input are taken off-chip to facilitate testing of each block individually. To achieve a wide dynamic range, the noise figure of the LNA and linearity of the mixer are of primary concern. Figure 2 shows the circuit schematic of the LNA. A differential architecture is chosen in anticipation of eventual integration of a complete GPS receiver. Its common mode rejection eases the task of rejecting interference from other on-chip elements, such as a DSP core. This choice results in increased amplifier noise for a given power dissipation compared to a single-ended implementation. This increase is mitigated by the high ωT of the process, that permits acceptable noise performance despite a differential implementation. The input stage, consisting of M 1, 2 and L 1, 2, uses inductive source degeneration to generate a real term in the differential input impedance equal to ωT(L 1 +L 2) that can be matched to the off-chip transmission lines from the image-reject filter. By resonating the input capacitance of the amplifier, the minimum possible noise figure can also be achieved [1]. A minimum exists due {{to the presence of}} induced gate noise in MOS devices, as described in Reference 2. The source degeneration inductors, L 1, 2, are imple-mented as on-chip spiral inductors.

40|$|By the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) nearly {{worldwide}} digital height {{models have}} been generated. The SRTM height models {{can be used for}} several applications, but it has gaps in mountainous regions, caused by the radar layover, and is not so accurate in steep areas. In addition the grid width of 3 arcsec, corresponding to approximately 92 m at the equator, is limiting the morphologic details. From the very high resolution optical space sensors {{only a limited number of}} stereo pairs, taken from the same orbit, are available. The automatic matching of images taken with significant time interval is very difficult and not leading to satisfying results. In addition stereo pairs from IKONOS, QuickBird and the former OrbView- 3 are expensive. The stereo pairs from the SPOT HRS only have been available <b>for</b> <b>test</b> <b>purposes,</b> usually <b>only</b> the derived height models can be bought, but they may be critical in forest areas (Büyüksalih, Jacobsen 2008). As alternative solution the stereo sensors Cartosat- 1 and ALOS/PRISM are now available; both systems with 2. 5 m ground sampling distance (GSD). Cartosat- 1 stereo pairs have been used for automatic image matching, leading even in forest areas to good results. Of course by matching as well as with the SRTM C-band and X-band digital surface models (DSMs) are generated, representing the visible surface. In most cases digital elevation models (DEMs) are requested, showing the height of the bare ground. DSMs can be filtered to DEMs if enough points of the bare ground are available. The height models based on Cartosat- 1 stereo pairs have been analyzed, including filtering. Partially it was necessary to shift the reference to the corresponding location...|$|R

This Bachelor’s Thesis is concerned with compression method based on wavelet packet transform, which is derived from wavelet transform.

40|$|Nirex is {{undertaking}} a Geosphere Characterisation Project {{that will}} demonstrate {{on the basis}} of designs and documents that: o if requested to do so, Nirex could implement a programme of geosphere characterisation; o it is practicable to characterise a site for {{the development and implementation of}} a phased geological disposal facility in the UK. The Geosphere Characterisation Project will support the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM) in assessing the viability of the Nirex Phased Disposal Concept. Variants to the Geosphere Characterisation Project designs and documents will also be provided. These will indicate how characterisation would vary if, {{on the basis of}} a Government decision or the recommendations of CoRWM, it was decided to develop a near-surface or deep interim storage facility for radioactive wastes rather than proceeding directly towards the development of a phased geological disposal facility. Data management will be a critical part of a Geosphere Characterisation Programme, in order to ensure that data are acquired in formats suitable for efficient processing, storage, and dissemination to all potential users. A British Geological Survey (BGS) awareness document (Baker, 2005) was designed to inform Nirex Programme and Project managers about a proposed method for design and implementation of an integrated database system to provide a central store for data holdings generated by a possible future Geosphere Characterisation Programme. Preliminary Nirex programming studies assumed that sites for detailed characterisation would be selected following a systematic geographical search process, including extended periods of consultation with key stakeholders. It was assumed that three and a half years would be required from commencement of the geographical search to the announcement, by Government, of the sites that would be investigated. It was further assumed that, following announcement of the sites for investigation, a year would be required to obtain planning permissions to undertake the investigations. Thus, four and a half years would elapse from commencement of the site selection process to commencement of investigations at the selected site(s). The studies also assume that approximately two and a half years would be required for implementation of the data management systems within the Programme. This includes time for: o Developing ideas about how to make information available to key stakeholders; o Developing the specifications for the Data System; o Procuring contracts for the design and implementation of the Data System; and o Building and testing the Data System. Such a period could readily be accommodated within the overall duration of the Programme and the activities would be undertaken in parallel with the site selection process. During subsequent discussions with the Nirex Directorate concerning possible programmes for implementing geosphere characterisation raised the question of possible implications if the time budgeted for the site selection process was reduced significantly. Such a situation could arise, for example, if a local community volunteered to host a repository. If site selection extent was reduced significantly and the planned Data System implementation programme retained, then the Data System might not be ready for the start of the investigations if the implementation commenced alongside the site selection process. Thus, either the start of the investigations would need to be delayed pending availability of the Data System or the investigations would need to commence before the Data System was available. The latter scenario was experienced during the Sellafield investigations, when the Nirex Digital Geoscience Database (NDGD) did not become functional until some five to six years after the start of the investigations. This created significant problems, most notably that information could not be made available to key stakeholders in a timely manner. Such failure to be forthcoming with information derived from the investigations is alien to the culture of openness and transparency that is now the accepted norm. Nirex has a clear preference for ensuring that the proposed Data System is functional (designed, built and tested) prior to commencement of data acquisition at any of the sites to be investigated. A number of possible approaches could be taken to ensure that the Data System is in place prior to commencement of the investigations and to remove their development from the critical path of the Programme. Possible approaches include: o Commence development of the Data System prior to instigation of the site selection process; or o Use the existing NDGD structure as the core of the Data System, adding whatever enhanced functionality is possible within the time available. Two alternative scenarios must be considered. Firstly, that it is decided to recommence investigations at the Longlands Farm Site near Sellafield and, secondly, that a decision is taken to study a new site, or new sites, not previously investigated. It is stressed that the above are hypothetical scenarios. The potential use of Sellafield data to populate any new database is <b>for</b> <b>test</b> <b>purposes</b> <b>only.</b> Their use does not indicate any intent on the part of Nirex to suggest that Sellafield, or any other site, should be selected for future characterisation. The decision on which sites to investigate will rest with Government...|$|R
40|$|Most {{machinery}} failures {{are attributed}} to wear of components. Experimental investigation of wear is highly demanding, especially for internal combustion (IC) engines, due to the complex reciprocating mechanism. This thesis presents a simulation based approach to investigate the wear related faults in IC engine bearings, through the integration of two approaches i. e. wear and vibration based analysis, for timely fault detection and prediction of remaining lifetime of the bearings. An engine dynamics model is established to provide the connecting rod bearing with actual service environment. The inherent engine inertia and the combustion force determine the magnitude of load on the bearing. To balance this load, a hybrid force model is developed to cover a range of lubrication regimes and provide real time information on bearing dynamics. The simulated information is robust to predict wear depths and generate corresponding vibration signals {{for a range of}} operating conditions. For wear calculation, a variable wear coefficient is simulated as a function of asperity contact area during transition from the mixed to boundary lubrication regime, thus signifying the severity of impending wear with growing contact. The effect of speed, external load and bearing clearance on vibration signals and wear severity is studied and validated through experiments. Envelope analysis successfully revealed the wear critical locations and wear severity for all operating conditions tested. From simulated data, appropriate vibration and wear based indicators are identified for correlation analysis. A relation is developed which can enable the prediction of bearing wear situation directly based on the selected vibration based indicator (I-Kaz coefficient) without having to actually inspect the bearing for wear. A framework for predicting the remaining lifetime of the bearings through instantaneous wear rates obtained from simulation is also presented. The application of the developed method is demonstrated on a Toyota 3 SFE engine, but the application is equally valid for any similar engine, provided the engine parameters are updated. Being vested with the combined benefits of wear and vibration based analysis techniques; the developed simulation is capable to detect bearing faults with good accuracy, with minimal dependence on real engine <b>testing,</b> <b>for</b> validation <b>purpose</b> <b>only...</b>|$|R
