30|$|As {{of the end}} of 2014, {{there are}} 13 provinces that have fully funded {{personal}} accounts, and the process is slow. 8 For convenience in research, this paper assumes that China has not fully funded personal accounts. Then, the personal account only has the payment records of employees, which provides numerical basis for granting <b>individual</b> <b>account</b> pension, as well as the balance of <b>individual</b> <b>account</b> pension. At the same time, the unified financial accounts include personal account payment income and fund payment income, which are used to pay for the basic pension, transitional pension, personal <b>account</b> pension, and <b>individual</b> <b>account</b> return expenses. The return of personal accounts also refers to the balance of <b>individual</b> <b>account</b> that granted to employees’ heirs in the situation that employees died. Moreover, if <b>individual</b> <b>account</b> is exhausted and the employees still survive, 9 the government would continue to grant <b>individual</b> <b>account</b> fund. To guarantee the reliability of the conclusion, this paper also show results of the situation with personal account funding in the part of sensitivity analysis.|$|R
40|$|Most {{recent data}} on family finances—This {{analysis}} uses {{the most recent}} data (2004) from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), a triennial survey of family finances by the Federal Reserve Board, as well historical SCF data, to examine the demographic factors associated with the ownership of <b>individual</b> <b>account</b> retirement plan assets. It examines the distribution of total assets held in <b>individual</b> <b>account</b> retirement plans across demographic characteristics of American families. Distribution of the retirement plan assets is then compared against the distribution of all assets owned across these demographic characteristics. Concentration of assets—The data show that <b>individual</b> <b>account</b> retirement plan assets are concentrated in families with higher net worth, higher family income, higher educational attainment, with older family heads, and with white, non-Hispanic heads.

40|$|China's newly {{established}} three-pillar pension system consists of: basic pension; fully funded individual account; and voluntary commercial pension insurance. The second component faces immense financial difficulties caused by transitional {{costs in the}} short term and demographic changes in the long term. In addition, the inefficiency of the current capital market and the lack of fund management skills mean that these financial problems are unlikely to be solved within the existing framework of the fully funded <b>individual</b> <b>account.</b> This paper suggests another option-changing the fully funded <b>individual</b> <b>account</b> to a notional defined contribution <b>individual</b> <b>account</b> that operates on a pay-as-you-go basis. This change will keep the advantages of the <b>individual</b> <b>account</b> and avoid the huge risks caused by China's immature capital market.

25|$|Unlike his predecessor, Hawke's {{authority}} {{within the}} Labor Party was absolute. This {{enabled him to}} persuade his MPs to support a substantial set of policy changes. <b>Individual</b> <b>accounts</b> from ministers indicate that while Hawke was not usually {{the driving force behind}} individual reforms, he took on the role of achieving consensus and providing political guidance on what was electorally feasible and how best to sell it to the public, tasks at which he proved highly successful. Hawke took on a very public role as Prime Minister, proving to be incredibly popular with the Australian electorate; to this date he still holds the highest ever AC Nielsen approval rating.|$|E
25|$|A {{plethora of}} anecdotes, <b>individual</b> <b>accounts</b> and poems {{on the battle}} survives, but {{the details of the}} battle itself are not clear, except that the day {{resulted}} in a crushing Umayyad victory: the main leaders of the Qays, including al-Dahhak, fell in the field. N. Elisséeff explains the Umayyad success by the possible defection of Qays-aligned tribes during the preceding weeks, eager to uphold the Syrian hegemony over the Caliphate. In addition, Elisséeff points out that the Umayyads still controlled the state treasury in Damascus, allowing them to bribe tribes to join them. The remnants of the Qays army fled to Qarqisiya under Zufar ibn al-Harith al-Kilabi, and Marwan was officially proclaimed as Caliph at Damascus.|$|E
25|$|<b>Individual</b> <b>accounts</b> of {{the massacres}} include several villages. In {{the village of}} Cherang near Diyarbekir, 114 men were killed and the women and {{children}} were put to forced agricultural labor and given the choice to convert or die. The massacre was committed by an Al-Khamsin death squad, which were recruited by the government and led by officials, while composed of local urban Muslims. In the village of Hanewiye, about 400 Assyrians are believed to have been murdered. In Hassana, a village near Jezire, the 300 inhabitants were massacred, with some managing to survive and flee. The inhabitants of the village of Kavel-Karre were attacked by Kurdish tribes on 19 June 1915 and killed; their bodies were then thrown into the Tigris River. In Kafarbe, 2km from the Mor Gabriel Monastery, 200 Assyrians were attacked by a clan of Kurds and murdered in 1917. However, there were also cases when those in power chose to protect the Assyrians, as Rachid Osman, the agha of Şırnak protected the 300–500 inhabitants of Harbol.|$|E

500|$|The Battle of Horseshoe Bend, {{though of}} little {{military}} significance, {{was a major}} {{turning point in the}} war for the volunteer militia forces and many white settlers. This minor militia victory was {{the first step in the}} process of redeeming the militia's own morale and its standing in the eyes of the settlers on the frontier. <b>Individual</b> <b>accounts</b> claim that the battle at Horseshoe Bend [...] "turn(ed) the tide of the war." [...] It was also notable for the proportion of killed in action to the number of combatants. All eleven Kickapoo that Dodge had pursued into the swamp were killed and scalped by his troops, while the final militia casualties were confined to three dead and one wounded. About an hour after the battle, Colonel William S. Hamilton arrived with friendly Menominee, Sioux and Ho-Chunk warriors. According to Dodge, the friendly warriors were given some of the scalps his men had taken, with which they were [...] "delighted". Dodge also reported that the Native Americans then proceeded on to the battlefield and mutilated the corpses of the fallen Kickapoo.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper uses an {{overlapping}} generations {{model to}} investigate the urban public pension in China. It examines {{the effects of the}} replacement rates and population growth rate on the capital-labor ratio, pension benefits, consumption and utility, and finds the optimal replacement rate. It is shown that raising the <b>individual</b> <b>account</b> benefit replacement rate only increases the <b>individual</b> <b>account</b> benefits. Raising the social pool benefit replacement rate induces the increase in the social pool benefits and retirement-period consumption, while the decrease in the capital-labor ratio, <b>individual</b> <b>account</b> benefits, working-period consumption and utility. The fall in the population growth rate leads to the increase in the capital-labor ratio, social pool benefits, <b>individual</b> <b>account</b> benefits, working-period consumption and utility, while the decrease in the retirement-period consumption. The optimal social pool benefit replacement rate depends on the individual discount factor, social discount factor, capital share of income and population growth rate, and it decreases in the case of fallen population growth rate. It will do more good than harm to raise the <b>individual</b> <b>account</b> benefit replacement rate, reduce the social pool benefit replacement rate and strictly implement China’s population policy...|$|R

2500|$|Similar to the {{experience}} of Salmon Dutton, former colonial militia Captain Hezekiah Barnes settled in Charlotte, Vermont, in 1787. [...] Following the war, Barnes also worked as a road surveyor; he also established an inn and trading post in Charlotte, along the main trade route from Montreal down Lake Champlain. Barnes’s stagecoach inn was built in traditional Georgian style, with 10 fireplaces and a ballroom on the interior, and a wraparound porch on the outside. [...] In 1800, Continental Army Captain Benjamin Harrington established a distillery business in Shelburne, Vermont, which supplied his nearby inn. Furthermore, Captain Stevens and Jeremiah Trescott built a water-powered sawmill in South Royalton, Vermont, in the late 1700s. These <b>individual</b> <b>accounts</b> shed light on the significance of Lake Champlain during the post-Revolutionary War period.|$|E
2500|$|Two broad {{categories}} of private pension plans are [...] "defined benefit pension plans" [...] and [...] "defined contribution pension plans." [...] Of these two, Social Security is {{more similar to}} a defined benefit pension plan. In a defined benefit pension plan, the benefits ultimately received are based {{on some sort of}} pre-determined formula (such as one based on years worked and highest salary earned). Defined benefit pension plans generally do not include separate accounts for each participant. By contrast, in a defined contribution pension plan each participant has a specific account with funds put into that account (by the employer or the participant, or both), and the ultimate benefit is based on the amount in that account at the time of retirement. Some have proposed that the Social Security system be modified to provide for the option of <b>individual</b> <b>accounts</b> (in effect, to make the system, at least in part, more like a defined contribution pension plan). Specifically, on February 2, 2005, President George W. Bush made Social Security a prominent theme of his State of the Union Address. He described the Social Security system as [...] "headed for bankruptcy", and outlined, in general terms, a proposal based on partial privatization. Critics responded that privatization would require huge new government borrowing to fund benefit payments during the transition years. See Social Security debate (United States).|$|E
