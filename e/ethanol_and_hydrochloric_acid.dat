40|$|Inspired by {{biological}} design principles, a panoscopic mimic diatom {{was created}} by hierarchical self-assembly of reactive amphiphiles in a multiphase medium comprising hexadecane, <b>ethanol,</b> water, <b>and</b> <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid.</b> Through simple stirring at room temperature, mesolamellar macroporous capsules covering oil droplets were obtained in large quantity, which was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and thermogravimetry. At the mesoscale, amphiphilic C 16 Si(OH) 3 assembled into bilayer lamellae through polycondensation, hydrophobic interaction, and H bonding. At the micrometer scale, the bilayer lamellae nucleated at the interface and grew into a polar phase, thus leading to delicate microcages or mimic diatoms. Moreover, the microcages tended to interconnect and fuse into a continuous coating at the centimeter scale, which provided hydrophobicity through the micropatterned surface. This paradigm for creating hierarchical materials with multiphases could lead to new "synthetic" material technologies and novel fascinating materials with anisotropic properties.

30|$|Identification of the tanning {{material}} {{of the historical}} leather is needed to understand the manufacture technology of the leather {{as well as the}} interaction of the laser radiation and tanned leather. The Ferric Spot Test [23, 28] was used to determine the type of tannin (vegetable or not) using fibres from the historical leather samples. The fibres samples were wetted with distilled water and soaked in (2  % w/v ferric chloride and water, FeCl 3 · 7 H 2 O). Positive result for the presence of vegetable tannins is indicated by dark colouring of the fibres. The Vanillin spot test for the testing the presence of condensed tannins was carried out using leather fibres samples (4  % vanillin in 99  % <b>ethanol,</b> <b>and</b> the <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> HCl). The presence of a red colour is an indication of the presence of condensed tannin. The Rhodanine spot test for testing the hydrolysable tannins was employed using leather fibres samples, 2  N H 2 SO 4, Rhodanine (0.667  % w/v in 99  % <b>ethanol)</b> <b>and</b> 0.5  N potassium hydroxide (KOH).

40|$|Insulin was {{extracted}} from pancreases obtained at autopsy from non-diabetic subjects (normal insulin) and from adult-onset diabetic subjects (diabetic insulin). Two pancreases were extracted with I M acetic acid, and the insulin containing {{fraction of the}} fluid portion of the extract was separated using Sephadex G 50. This fraction was lyophillised, then incubated with anti-insulin serum (guinea pig) and the insulin-anti-insulin complex separated using Sephadex G 50. Insulin was then dissociated from this complex using I M acetic acid, and separated from other protein with Sephadex G 50. This process yields only substances reacting with anti-insulin serum. Other pancreases were extracted with a mixture containing <b>ethanol,</b> water <b>and</b> <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> at pH 3 ̆c 1. 5. The fluid portion of this extract was neutralised with ammonia and centrifuged. Insulin was precipitated from the supernate on addition of <b>ethanol</b> <b>and</b> diethyl ether.

A mixture of uniformly labeled 14 c glucose (2 uc) together with normal or diabetic insulin in a total volume of 2 ml was injected intraperitoneally into each of 10 male Wistar rats.

40|$|AbstractWhen the gastric mucosa {{is exposed}} to various irritants, {{apoptosis}} and subsequent gastric mucosal lesion can result in vivo. We here show that gastric irritants induced apoptosis in gastric mucosal cells in primary culture and examined its molecular mechanism. <b>Ethanol,</b> hydrogen peroxide, <b>and</b> <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> all induced, in a dose-dependent manner, cell death, apoptotic DNA fragmentation, and chromatin condensation, suggesting {{that each of these}} gastric irritants induced apoptosis in vitro. Since each of these irritants decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential and stimulated the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, gastric irritant-induced apoptosis seems to be mediated by mitochondrial dysfunction. Caspase- 3, caspase- 8, and caspase- 9 -like activities were all activated simultaneously by each of these irritants and the activation was concomitantly with cell death and apoptotic DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, pre-treatment of gastric mucosal cells with an inhibitor of caspase- 8 suppressed the onset of cell death as well as the stimulation of caspase- 3 - and caspase- 9 -like activities caused by each of these gastric irritants. Based on these results, we consider that caspase- 8, an initiator caspase, {{plays an important role in}} gastric irritant-induced apoptosis...|$|R
40|$|Of the {{reactions}} in which pyrroles and indoles {{are reported to}} undergo ring expansion, the example investigated initially - the conversion of 2 -carbamyl- 2 -cyano-dihydroindole to 3 -carbamyl- 2 -hydroxyquinoline - proved to be incorrect. The supposed dihydroindole compound (a reduction product of alpha-cyano-o-nitrocinnamamide) was actually 2 -amino- 3 -carbamylquinoline (Section A). The general reaction whereby pyrroles and indoles are converted by trihalomethanes/base to 2 -pyrrole and 3 -indole aldehydes, and 3 -halopyridines and quinolines was next examined (Section B). Three instances of the isolation of a dichloromethyl pyrrolenine or indolenine and its subsequent conversion to a pyridine or quinoline are recorded in the literature. The dichloromethyl derivative had therefore been suggested to be an intermediate for both aldehyde formation and the ring expansion. From paper chromatographic experiments the ring expansion of 3 -dichloromethyl- 2 : 3 -dimethylindolenine to 3 -chloro- 2 : 4 -dimethylquinoline {{does not appear to}} occur. But a product whose picrate corresponds, by analysis, to that of 3 -ethoxy- 2 : 4 -dimethylquinoline (and not to 2 : 3 -dimethylindolenine- 3 -aldehyde or its diethyl acetal derivative) has been obtained from the action of sodiumethoxide on 3 -dichloromethyl- 2 : 3 -dimethylindolenine. This suggests that the ring expansion does occur here, possibly by means of a labile intermediary, produced during solvolysis of the dichloromethyl group. A mechanism: has been suggested, and also one for the 'direct' conversion of pyrroles and indoles to pyridines and quinolines. A preliminary kinetic investigation of the reactionof sodium ethoxide on the dichloromethyl derivative was begun. Several 2 -aminoquinolines and their N-oxides, and some 3 -substituted 2 : 4 -dimethylquinolines were availablefrom the work recorded in Sections A and B. The spectra ofthe N-oxides in <b>ethanol,</b> <b>and</b> aqueous <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> andsodium hydroxide, were measured (Section C). Spectra ofthe other derivatives were measured in the first twosolvents. As previously observed, the N-oxides show abathochromic effect in <b>ethanol</b> <b>and</b> alkali, but have thesame absorption as the corresponding quinolines in acid. The general characteristics of the 2 : 4 -dimethylquinoline series conform with published results. <p...|$|R
40|$|The global gene {{expression}} and biomolecular composition in an Escherichia coli model strain exposed to 10 adverse conditions (sodium chloride, <b>ethanol,</b> glycerol, <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>and</b> acetic <b>acid,</b> sodium hydroxide, heat (46 °C), and cold (15 °C), {{as well as}} ethidium bromide and the disinfectant benzalkonium chloride) were determined using DNA microarrays and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. In total, approximately 40 % of all investigated genes (1682 / 4279 genes) significantly changed expression, compared with a nonstressed control. There were, however, only 3 genes (ygaW (unknown function), rmf (encoding a ribosomal modification factor), and ghrA (encoding a glyoxylate/hydroxypyruvate reductase)) that significantly changed expression under all conditions (not including benzalkonium chloride). The FT-IR analysis showed an increase in unsaturated fatty acids during <b>ethanol</b> <b>and</b> cold exposure, and a decrease during acid and heat exposure. Cold conditions induced changes in the carbohydrate composition of the cell, possibly related to the upregulation of outer membrane genes (glgAP and rcsA). Although some covariance was observed between the 2 data sets, principle component analysis and regression analyses revealed that the {{gene expression}} and the biomolecular responses are not well correlated in stressed populations of E. coli, underlining the importance of multiple strategies to {{begin to understand the}} effect on the whole cell...|$|R
