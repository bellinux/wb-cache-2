5000|$|A <b>gate</b> <b>valve,</b> {{also known}} as a sluice valve, is a valve which opens by lifting a round or {{rectangular}} gate/wedge out of the path of the fluid. The distinct feature of a <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> is the sealing surfaces between the gate and seats are planar, so gate valves are often used when a straight-line flow of fluid and minimum restriction is desired. The gate faces can be parallel, but are most commonly wedge-shaped. Gate valves are primarily used to permit or prevent the flow of liquids, but typical gate valves shouldn't be used for regulating flow, unless they are specifically designed for that purpose. Because of their ability to cut through liquids, gate valves are often used in the petroleum industry. For extremely thick fluids, a specialty valve often known as a knife <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> is used to cut through the liquid. [...] On opening the <b>gate</b> <b>valve,</b> the flow path is enlarged in a highly nonlinear manner with respect to percent of opening. This means that flow rate does not change evenly with stem travel. Also, a partially open gate tends to vibrate from the fluid flow. Most of the flow change occurs near shutoff with a relatively high fluid velocity causing gate and seat wear and eventual leakage if used to regulate flow. Typical gate valves are designed to be fully opened or closed. [...] When fully open, the typical <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> has no obstruction in the flow path, resulting in very low friction loss.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{availability}} on {{the market}} of remote control valves for water distribution systems allows a more flexible implementation of the “divide and conquer” paradigm, that consists in dividing large networks into smaller district meter areas defining a water network partitioning (WNP), aiming at controlling water balance, pressure levels and water quality protection. The positioning of <b>gate</b> <b>valves</b> is carried out using optimization approaches to guarantee the network reliability that can be significantly reduced by WNP owing to the closure of several pipes by means of <b>gate</b> <b>valves,</b> decreasing topologic and energy redundancy. Anyway, starting from the optimal positioning of remote controlled <b>gate</b> <b>valves,</b> obtained with SWANP software, the paper investigates the effectiveness of dynamic control, in order to face hydraulic failure in fire estinguishment. The proposed methodology, based on heuristic optimization algorithm, finds the optimal layouts minimizing the number of valves to be opened and maximizing the system performance. The study highlights the advantages of adaptively reconfigurable networks starting from a partitioned system, confirming that a dynamic control represents a significant improvement for smart water networks...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWater Network Partitioning (WNP) {{improves}} {{water network}} management, simplifying the computation of water budgets and, consequently, allowing {{the identification and}} reduction of water loss. It is achieved by inserting flow meters and <b>gate</b> <b>valves</b> in the network, previously clustered in subsystems.

The second one chooses the boundary pipes where flow meters or <b>gate</b> <b>valves</b> are to be inserted. In this paper, SWANP software is employed to achieve a network clustering through two different algorithms based on a multilevel-recursive bisection and community-structure procedures. After that, a novel multi-objective function is introduced and applied to a large Mexican network integrating both cost and energy performance, thus providing a smart Decision Support System (DSS) based on qualitative and quantitative measures, and diagrams for evaluating the optimal layout {{in terms of the}} number of districts, cost, and hydraulic performance...|$|R
