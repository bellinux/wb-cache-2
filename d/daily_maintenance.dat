25|$|The {{residents}} and staff together took {{responsibility for the}} <b>daily</b> <b>maintenance</b> {{of the community and}} all contributed to cooking and cleaning. The young people were considered to be partners in the therapeutic endeavour and there was an expectation that everyone attended the daily community meetings. These meetings were the heart of the community and often young people were able to share and resolve very painful experiences from their past, and the daily difficulties and challenges of sixty adults and children living together could be addressed in a helpful way. There were high expectations on young people to help each other and to achieve educationally. Many young people left to go to university and others took up higher education at a later point in their adult lives. Unfortunately a big fire broke out in 1990 and the building was uninsured. Residential care for children has also fallen out of favour as a result of abuse scandals and Peper Harow was sold and redeveloped into flats. It still has an influence today.

25|$|Fluids are {{commonly}} given, either orally by nasogastric tube or by intravenous catheter, to restore proper hydration and electrolyte balance. In cases of strangulating obstruction or enteritis, the intestine will have decreased absorption and increased secretion of fluid into the intestinal lumen, making oral fluids ineffective and possibly dangerous if they cause gastric distention and rupture. This process of secretion into the intestinal lumen leads to dehydration, and these horse require {{large amounts of}} IV fluids to prevent hypotension and subsequent cardiovascular collapse. Fluid rates are calculated by adding the fluid lost during each collection of gastric reflux to the <b>daily</b> <b>maintenance</b> requirement of the horse. Due {{to the fact that}} horses absorb water in the cecum and colon, the IV fluid requirement of horses with simple obstruction is dependent on the location of the obstruction. Those that are obstructed further distally, such as at the pelvic flexure, are able to absorb more oral fluid than those obstructed in the small intestine, and therefore require less IV fluid support. Impactions are usually managed with fluids for 3–5 days before surgery is considered. Fluids are given based on results of the physical examination, such as mucous membrane quality, PCV, and electrolyte levels. Horses in circulatory shock, such as those suffering from endotoxemia, require very high rates of IV fluid administration. Oral fluids via nasogastric tube are often given in the case of impactions to help lubricate the obstruction. Oral fluids should not be given if significant amounts of nasogastric reflux are obtained. Access to food and water will often be denied to allow careful monitoring and administration of what is taken in by the horse.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{equipment}} {{rotation and}} maintenance concerns, Caltrain said in 2009 {{that it could}} not dedicate cars with higher bike capacity on trains with high bike demand. Many of you have written to ask a series of questions about this new effort: Why can’t we provide two bike cars on every train? Why can’t we provide two bike cars on my train? Why can’t we provide two bike cars on the most heavily used trains? Why is there only one bike car on trains that are supposed to have two bike cars? The simplest answer to most of these questions is that we don’t have enough bike cars to put two on every train, or even on every peak train, and, in doing all we can to expand service for our cycling customers, we have to be mindful of the impact of these changes on our entire system and all of our customers, particularly on on-time performance. All of our cars, not just our bike cars, serve our entire schedule throughout our entire day, which means they rotate through the schedule, and also must be rotated out of service for fueling, washing, maintenance and federally mandated safety and operational inspections. A train set that starts its day in San Jose may finish its day in Millbrae and be cycled to San Francisco for its <b>daily</b> <b>maintenance</b> and to begin the next day at the San Francisco station. Because of this rotation – because of the demands of our entire service schedule – we can’t guarantee that a specific stop on the schedule will have a specific train.}} Eventually, two bike cars were added to every train consist by 2011, and in 2016, a third bike car was added to Bombardier consists.|$|E

Acid system is used for the determination of TIC, and water system is used for the determination of TC and TN. Detector consists of two IR (non-dispersive infrared), and each IR detector has three channels, used for the detection of different concentration samples. The common failures: 1. 1 The syringe with bubbles: the TOC analyzer has two syringes, one is used to absorb acid solution, the other is used to absorb ultrapure water and samples. No matter which syringe has bubble, it means quantity of solution is not enough. It influences the determination results. The cause of the failure and the solution are shown in table...|$|R

40|$|A set of continuous, {{high-resolution}} atmospheric radon (Rn- 222) concentration {{time series}} and radon soil flux measurements were acquired {{during the summer}} of 1990 at a micrometeorological tower site 13 km northwest of Schefferville, Quebec, Canada. The tower was located in a dry upland, open-canopy lichen-spruce woodland. For the period July 23 to August 1, 1990, the mean radon soil flux was 41. 1 +/- 4. 8 Bq m(exp - 2) /h. Radon surface flux from the two end-member forest floor cover types (lichen mat and bare soil) were 38. 8 +/- 5. 1 and 61. 8 +/- 15. 6 Bq m(exp - 2) /h, respectively. Average total forest canopy resistances computed using a simple 'flux box' model for radon exchange between the forest canopy and the overlying atmosphere range from 0. 47 +/- 0. 24 s cm(exp - 1) to 2. 65 +/- 1. 61 cm(exp - 1) for daytime hours (0900 - 1700 LT) and from 3. 44 +/- 0. 91 s cm(exp - 1) to 10. 55 +/- 7. 16 s cm(exp - 1) for nighttime hours (2000 - 0600) for the period July 23 to August 6, 1990.
