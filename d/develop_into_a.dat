40|$|This article {{describes}} {{some of the}} progress made {{in the understanding of}} the growth of polymer lamellae and spherulites using atomic force microscopy (AFM) in the last five years. High-resolution and real-time AFM phase imaging enables us to observe the detailed growth process of lamellae. During the early stage of crystallization, embryos appear and disappear on the film surface. <b>A</b> stable embryo <b>develops</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> single lamella, which <b>develops</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> founding lamella. Then, the founding lamella <b>develops</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> lamellar sheaf through branching and splaying. Through further branching and splaying, <b>a</b> lamellar sheaf <b>develops</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> spherulite with two eyes at its center...|$|R
50|$|In {{flowering}} plants, {{the female}} gametophyte (sometimes {{referred to as}} the embryo sac) has been reduced to just eight cells inside the ovule. The gametophyte cell closest to the micropyle opening of the ovule <b>develops</b> <b>into</b> the egg cell. Upon pollination, a pollen tube delivers sperm into the gametophyte and one sperm nucleus fuses with the egg nucleus. The resulting zygote <b>develops</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> embryo inside the ovule. The ovule in turn <b>develops</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> seed and in many cases the plant ovary <b>develops</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> fruit to facilitate the dispersal of the seeds. Upon germination, the embryo grows <b>into</b> <b>a</b> seedling.|$|R
5|$|In 1846 {{the first}} railway line reached Richmond. Richmond Gasworks opened in 1848, and Richmond began to <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> {{significant}} town. The District Railway (later the District line) reached Richmond in 1877, connecting {{it to the}} London Underground. Commuting to central London became feasible and affordable, leading to further population growth in the previously relatively isolated Richmond and Twickenham areas.|$|E
5|$|On January 27, RSMC Nadi issued {{strong wind}} {{warnings}} for Fiji, as 12F {{was expected to}} affect Fiji but not <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> tropical cyclone until it had {{moved out of the}} archipelago. However, as 12F rapidly developed into a tropical cyclone during that day, RSMC Nadi was forced to issue gale force wind warnings for various parts of Fiji including Vanua Levu, Viti Levu, Beqa, Vatulele, Lomaiviti, Yasawa and Mamanuca.|$|E
5|$|Some {{studies of}} older {{children}} have identified further attachment classifications. Main and Cassidy observed that disorganized behavior in infancy can <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> child using caregiving-controlling or punitive behaviour {{in order to}} manage a helpless or dangerously unpredictable caregiver. In these cases, the child's behaviour is organized, but the behaviour is treated by researchers {{as a form of}} 'disorganization' (D) since the hierarchy in the family is no longer organized according to parenting authority.|$|E
25|$|The larvae of {{many groups}} of mantis shrimp are poorly known. In the {{superfamily}} Lysiosquilloidea, the larvae hatch as antizoea larvae, with five pairs of thoracic appendages, and <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> erichthus larvae, where the pleopods appear. In the Squilloidea, <b>a</b> pseudozoea larva <b>develops</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> alima larva, while in Gonodactyloidea, <b>a</b> pseudozoea <b>develops</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> erichthus.|$|R

5|$|A second, {{far smaller}} storm cell passed along a similar {{route to the}} first {{later in the evening}} of 14 April. This cell was never given the {{classification}} of 'severe' by the Bureau of Meteorology, nor did it <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> supercell like its predecessor. Therefore, the route of the second cell was more direct and predictable than the first, following the general movement of the cold front (see conditions and climatology), and the Bureau of Meteorology issued warnings to all residents in the second cell's projected path to expect further storm activity.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance was observed on November19 about 800km (500mi) southeast of Colombo, Sri Lanka in the Bay of Bengal. The disturbance tracked westward, gradually organizing and prompting the JTWC {{to issue a}} Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on November22. After passing south of Sri Lanka, it became disorganized and was no longer considered likely to <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> tropical cyclone. The circulation associated with the system continued westward, reorganizing on November26 in the Arabian Sea. Despite being located unusually close to the equator, the disturbance maintained convection, or thunderstorms, which was becoming organized around the weak low-level circulation. With low wind shear and diffluence aloft, the JTWC remarked the system had a fair chance of developing.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{entered the}} Atlantic Ocean from Africa on July 10, and the wave developed {{into an area}} of low pressure while passing over Cape Verde. Despite the organization, the low failed to <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> tropical cyclone due to cool waters on the sea surface and wind shear. However, those unfavorable conditions did not completely destroy the wave, as it continued traveling westward through the Lesser Antilles until July 18. That day, while south of Puerto Rico, the wave split in two; the northern half moved northwest and developed into Tropical Storm Franklin over the Bahamas, and the southern half continued westward, with its associated thunderstorm activity increasing.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on July9, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) began {{dispatching}} aircraft reconnaissance {{to investigate}} {{an area of}} thunderstorms between Yap State and Koror that had potential to <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> tropical cyclone. Tracking westward, there were few signs of organization or intensification until July12, when recon found a closed atmospheric circulation within the disturbance, signifying that a tropical depression had developed; JTWC bulletins and warnings commenced accordingly. Upon development, observations indicated that the system was quickly developing in favorable conditions, with initial reconnaissance flights finding a loose eye measuring 160km (100mi) in diameter shortly after classification as a tropical depression. Twelve hours later, the JTWC upgraded the cyclone to tropical storm status, assigning the name Billie.|$|E
5|$|Driven {{by early}} {{enjoyment}} of the media coverage of cricket, Agnew developed a love for playing the game. At the end of days spent watching cricket on television in a blacked-out room with the commentary provided by the radio, Agnew {{would go into the}} garden and practise his bowling for hours, trying to imitate the players he had seen. Agnew's father, an amateur cricketer, taught him the rudiments of the sport, including an offspin action, as he wanted his son to <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> bowler like him. Another family connection to cricket was his first cousin, Mary Duggan, who was a women's Test player for England from 1948 to 1963.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} quarter of the 7th century, the {{quayside}} settlement at Gipeswic (Ipswich) became an important estuarine trading centre, receiving imported goods such as pottery from other trading markets situated around the coasts of the North Sea. Steven Plunkett suggests that the founding of Gipeswic took place under Wuffingas supervision. It took another hundred years for the settlement to <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> town, but its beginnings can be seen as a reflection of the personal importance of RÃ¦dwald during the period of his supremacy.|$|E

5|$|Hepatitis viruses can <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> chronic viral {{infection}} {{that leads to}} liver cancer. Infection by human T-lymphotropic virus can lead to tropical spastic paraparesis and adult T-cell leukaemia. Human papillomaviruses are an established cause of cancers of cervix, skin, anus, and penis. Within the Herpesviridae, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus causes Kaposi's sarcoma and body-cavity lymphoma, and EpsteinâBarr virus causes Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, B lymphoproliferative disorder, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Merkel cell polyomavirus closely related to SV40 and mouse polyomaviruses {{that have been used}} as animal models for cancer viruses for over 50 years.|$|E

5|$|In its Tropical Cyclone Report on Grace, the National Hurricane Center {{reported}} that the formation of Grace was poorly forecast. The first mention of the precursor low on October1 predicted {{that it would not}} <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> tropical or subtropical cyclone. Over the following three days, the system was not mentioned in the NHC's tropical weather outlooks until just prior to Grace's classification. The lack of preceding outlooks was attributed to the storm's unusual location and the sparsity of data for storms in the region.|$|E
5|$|Increased wartime {{manufacturing}} and industrial growth {{ushered in a}} new era of economic prosperity and the rise of labor unions in the city. By 1880 Indianapolis was Indiana's commercial and industrial center. New industries in Indianapolis included pork-packing plants and foundries, as well as numerous manufacturers, small businesses, retail shops, and banks. In 1876 Colonel Eli Lilly opened a new pharmaceutical laboratory on Indianapolis's Pearl Street, founding what later became Eli Lilly and Company. The Union Railroad Transfer and Stock Yards Company, another major employer, opened in 1877. After the war, Indianapolis continued to <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> transportation hub. Existing railroad lines expanded and new ones were established, linking Indianapolis to other cities across the nation.|$|E
5|$|On November 1, {{convection}} {{increased in}} the complex system that absorbed the remnants of Nicholas, and the National Hurricane Center indicated the system could <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> tropical or subtropical cyclone at any time. The low continued quickly westward, generating only sporadic convection, and crossed Florida on November 3. After entering the Gulf of Mexico, it turned to the west-northwest, and without organizing it made landfall in southeast Louisiana on November 4. It continued inland, and quickly weakened over Louisiana and Mississippi on November 5.|$|E
