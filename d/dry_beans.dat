500|$|The {{vegetables}} {{most commonly}} added to borscht are beetroots, white cabbage, carrots, parsley root, potatoes, onions and tomatoes. Some recipes may also call for beans, tart apples, turnip, celeriac, zucchini or bell peppers. Parsnip {{may be used}} as a substitute for parsley root, and tomato paste is often used as well as or instead of fresh tomatoes. The traditional technique of preparing the soup is to precook the vegetables – by sautéing, braising, boiling or baking – separately from the meat and only then to combine them with the stock. This distinctive feature of borscht derives from the practice of slow cooking in the Russian oven (traditional masonry stove, used for both cooking and heating), wherein the differences in cooking times of individual ingredients had {{to be taken into account}} in order to ensure that all components reach doneness at the same time. The importance of this method is reflected in the Russian language, where a variant in which all vegetables are added raw directly into the stock is referred to by the diminutive form [...] rather than [...] Vegetables are usually julienned, except for potatoes and zucchini, which are diced. The beetroots may be partially baked before being sprinkled with vinegar or lemon juice to preserve the color and braised separately from other vegetables. Onions, carrots, parsley root, turnip and other root vegetables are sautéed (traditionally in animal fat, especially lard or butter) and then mixed with tomatoes or tomato paste. <b>Dry</b> <b>beans</b> are boiled separately. Potatoes and cabbage are boiled in the stock for about 15 minutes before the precooked vegetables are added.|$|E

40|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>bean</b> {{production}} and price statistics for Burundi from 1972 to 1987 indicate significant year-to-year (bean production) and monthly (bean prices) fluctuations. These fluctuations are influenced by, among other things, climatic conditions, unpredictable markets, government policy, and phytopathological factors. The {{objective of the}} study is to analyze the behavior of <b>dry</b> <b>bean</b> production in Burundi under uncertain prices and assess the degree of uncertainty for the period 1972 - 1987. The hypotheses are that <b>dry</b> <b>bean</b> prices in Burundi are uncertain, and that annual <b>dry</b> <b>bean</b> production per capita has been falling because of <b>dry</b> <b>bean</b> price uncertainty. Two types of regressions models, one with average annual data and another with monthly real price data, were used to test the hypotheses.

The findings indicate that <b>dry</b> <b>bean</b> prices were more uncertain in the first period than in the second period. In addition, the results showed that greater price uncertainty was associated with lower bean production. Consequently, bean price stabilization possibly leads to increased bean production.

When in 606, Nebuchadnezzar carried to Babylon Jehoiachin and the nobles of Judah, he commanded {{that some of the}} royal children should be brought up as slaves to serve in his palace, and gave them new names after his gods.

So blessed was their abstinence, that they excelled all the other youths both in beauty and in wisdom, and were soon promoted above them. Soon after, Daniel was shown to be a prophet, for God inspired him, not merely with the meaning of Nebuchadnezzar's perplexing dream, but revealed to him the dream itself, which the king had forgotten. That dream was the emblematic history of the world. It was an image with a head of gold, shoulders of silver, thighs of brass, legs of iron, feet partly of iron, partly of clay, all overthrown together by a stone cut out without hands from a mountain. Great Babylon was the head, soon to give way to the less splendid Persian power, then again to the Greek dominion, and lastly to the iron rule of Rome, which would grow weak and mixed with miry clay, till at last all would be overthrown and subdued by the Stone which the builders rejected.|$|E

40|$|Weed {{seedlings}} emerging with <b>dry</b> <b>bean</b> (Phaseolus vulgaris) or {{soon thereafter}} {{are a major}} problem because they interfere with crop growth and development more than later emerging weeds. Mechanical practices like between-row cultivation usually control weeds located away from crop plants, {{but one of the}} major concerns of <b>dry</b> <b>bean</b> producers is the growth of weeds located on the crop row. <b>Dry</b> <b>bean</b> yield reductions by weeds growing in the crop row may be avoided by timely control of weeds with rotary hoeing, in-row cultivation, and chemical methods. Field experiments were conducted in 1996 and 1997 to (1) evaluate the effect of mechanical cultivation, herbicides, and <b>dry</b> <b>bean</b> on weed seedling emergence; and (2) evaluate weed control and <b>dry</b> <b>bean</b> response to singular or combinations of rotary hoeing, in-row cultivation, and herbicides. Total weed emergence in 1996 and 1997 was similar in cropped and noncropped areas. Herbicides were more effective than mechanical cultivation in reducing weed emergence by 91 % in 1996 and 88 % in 1997. Initial weed seedling emergence was observed at about 120 TT units with 3 to 9 % cumulative emergence in 1996, while weed emergence was first observed at 80 TT units with 6 to 16 % cumulative emergence among treatments in 1997. In both years, there was a trend for weed emergence in the untreated control and rotary hoed plots to be 26 % on average lower in cropped areas than in noncropped areas implying a competitive effect by the <b>dry</b> <b>bean</b> crop. Although weed seedling emergence occurred throughout the growing season more weed seedlings emerged in June and early July than in late July and August. Therefore, these data support the importance of applying mechanical in-row weed control treatments early in the growing season when a majority of the weed seedlings are emerging. The effect of <b>dry</b> <b>bean</b> on weed emergence was accurately modeled by the Gompertz function, but models developed to predict weed emergence when rotary hoeing and in-row cultivation were used failed to accurately predict weed emergence. <b>Dry</b> <b>bean</b> stands were not reduced by rotary hoeing, in-row cultivation, and herbicides in 1996, but in-row cultivation reduced <b>dry</b> <b>bean</b> population by 21 % compared to rotary hoeing in 1997. Difference in <b>dry</b> <b>bean</b> yields between years was due to different weed densities. Weed density in 1996 was 35 plants/m 2 and in 1997 was 135 plants/m 2. The combination of EPTC plus ethalfluralin applied alone or combined with rotary hoeing or in-row cultivation had lower weed densities than dimethenamid or imazethapyr plus bentazon. Among herbicides, the group of treatments with dimethenamid had 23 and 53 % lower <b>dry</b> <b>bean</b> seed yields than the group of treatments with EPTC plus ethalfluralin that had the highest seed yields in 1996 and 1997, respectively. ...|$|R

Six S. sclerotiorum isolates of known relative aggressiveness were inoculated on each of three soybean and <b>dry</b> <b>bean</b> cultivars with varied response to S. sclerotiorum. For soybean, all three inoculation methods accurately identified isolate aggressiveness irrespective of cultivar, but identification of susceptible and partially resistant soybean cultivars was influenced by isolate. For <b>dry</b> <b>bean,</b> the cotyledon and cut stem methods accurately identified isolate aggressiveness, but identification of susceptible and partially resistant <b>dry</b> <b>bean</b> cultivars was influenced by isolate and inoculation method.

When considering root mean square residual error combined over species and experiments, coefficient of variation based on residual error, significance of isolate-by-cultivar interaction from ANOVA, rank correlation between pairs of methods, and sensitivity ratio for the three resistance screening methods under controlled environmental conditions, the cut stem method was statistically better than the cotyledon and detached leaf methods for evaluating resistance in soybean and <b>dry</b> <b>bean</b> cultivars...|$|R
