5|$|In November 1965, {{together}} with four business partners, David opened Elizabeth David Ltd, a shop selling kitchen equipment, at 46 Bourne Street, Pimlico. The partners were {{spurred on by}} the closure of a professional <b>kitchenware</b> shop in Soho on the retirement of its owner, and the recent success of Terence Conran's Habitat shops, which sold among much else imported kitchen equipment for which there was evidently a market. Among her customers were Albert and Michel Roux, who shopped there for equipment that they would otherwise have to buy in France.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} year, the {{different}} band members then worked part-time jobs {{along with the}} rest of their work with the band. After continuous gigging around the Midlands, it wasn't long until word of mouth helped them become a popular unsigned band. The band then sent out a one track demo cd of Bullets, earning them the interest of several British labels, with thirty A reps coming to see them play at Birmingham. In October 2004, the group signed to Newcastle based indie label <b>Kitchenware</b> Records. Upon signing to the record label they changed their band name to Editors.|$|E

She was a key figure of 1960s entertainment and arts culture, {{as well as a}} girlfriend and muse to Beatle Paul McCartney.|$|E
25|$|The urban {{middle class}} imitated the luxurious dining {{styles of the}} upper class as best as they could. Living in smaller apartments, the kitchen was the main room—here, the family lived. The study or living room was saved for special {{occasions}} such as an occasional dinner invitation. Because of this, these middle-class kitchens were often more homely {{than those of the}} upper class, where the kitchen was a work-only room occupied only by the servants. Besides a cupboard to store the <b>kitchenware,</b> there were a table and chairs, where the family would dine, and sometimes—if space allowed—even a fauteuil or a couch.|$|E
25|$|It {{was rare}} that recipes {{for use in}} dire {{situations}} were included in recipe collections, but one example from a cookbook in Low German has been preserved. It gives instructions for a wartime stew consisting of any available greens and vegetables to be boiled in animal stomachs or intestines, an effective method in situations where no proper <b>kitchenware</b> would be available. In the First Margrave War, the city of Nuremberg was able to feed its citizens properly and still emerge victorious through careful planning, extensive stockpiling of grain and meat and strict control of prices by the town council.|$|E
25|$|Also {{within the}} scheme are two hotels, {{including}} a £15million Ramada Encore hotel with 151 {{rooms on the}} corner of Icknield Street and Pope Street. The second hotel will contain 100 rooms. Alfred McAlpine and New World Leisure have been appointed by Chord Deeley to develop and operate the hotels in a joint venture. Most of the buildings on the site are derelict and in a poor state of repair and whilst none of them are listed, the Kettleworks, the former Swan <b>kitchenware</b> factory which dates back to 1890, is to be retained. Work began in summer 2008 on the first phase and the entire scheme is expected to be completed in 2012. It is estimated to cost £130million and is hoped that between 1,500-2,500 jobs will be created as a result.|$|E
25|$|Forging is a {{manufacturing}} process involving {{the shaping of}} metal using localized compressive forces. The blows are delivered with a hammer (often a power hammer) or a die. Forging is often classified according to the temperature at which it is performed: cold forging (a type of cold working), warm forging, or hot forging (a type of hot working). For the latter two, the metal is heated, usually in a forge. Forged parts can range in weight from less than a kilogram to hundreds of metric tons. Forging {{has been done by}} smiths for millennia; the traditional products were <b>kitchenware,</b> hardware, hand tools, edged weapons, cymbals, and jewellery. Since the Industrial Revolution, forged parts are widely used in mechanisms and machines wherever a component requires high strength; such forgings usually require further processing (such as machining) to achieve a finished part. Today, forging is a major worldwide industry.|$|E
25|$|The town of Capula {{is quiet}} colonial town located between Lake Patzcuaro {{and the city}} of Morelia. The most {{traditional}} is <b>kitchenware</b> such as pots and plates, which are decorated in small painted dots in a style known here as puntillaje, often to form flowers. This technique dates back to the clay pots from the pre Hispanic era. Since the 1980s, it has also been known for the making of ceramic images of La Catrina, a figure initially created by graphic artist Jose Guadalupe Posada. This began in the workshop of Juan Torres, who took the skeletal figure and made his own variations on the theme. Since then, most artisans in the town have turned to the making of these figures, some in more modern dress and even male versions called Catrinos. Capula attracts some tourists who come to see the demonstrations of how the wares are made. This small town is {{the only one in the}} state that boasts government certifications of origin for three of its products, punteada pottery, the Catrinas and a simpler pottery called loza tradicional.|$|E

Chamba is also noted for its wood carvings, which, like the metalware is often used for iconography in temples, such as Chamunda Devi. A [...] "Nagara", a form of kettle drum is produced in Chamba as are cymbals, bells and [...] "Singa” or [...] "Ransinga" [...] (horns) produced in both straight and curved styles.

Different kinds of cereals and pasta are followed by an enumeration of fruits and mushrooms which may be either fresh or dried. The list of vegetables includes, now largely forgotten, cardoon, Jerusalem artichoke and turnip-rooted chervil, or popie jajka (literally, [...] "priest's balls"), as Czerniecki calls it. Under the heading of [...] "spices" [...] come not only saffron, black pepper, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, mace and cumin, all of which were used abundantly in Czerniecki's cookery, but also powdered sugar, rice, [...] "large" [...] and [...] "small" [...] raisins, citrus fruits such as lemons, limes and oranges, and even smoked ham and smoked beef tongue, which were also used as seasonings.|$|E

2500|$|By 1930, {{designer}} Paul T. Frankl considered Bakelite a [...] "Materia Nova", [...] "expressive {{of our own}} age". By the 1930s, Bakelite {{was used}} for game pieces like chessmen, poker chips, dominoes and mahjong sets. <b>Kitchenware</b> made with Bakelite, including canisters and tableware, was promoted for its resistance to heat and to chipping. [...] In the mid-1930s, Northland marketed a line of skis with a black [...] "Ebonite" [...] base, a coating of Bakelite. By 1935, it was used in solid-body electric guitars. [...] Performers such as Jerry Byrd loved the tone of Bakelite guitars but found them difficult to keep in tune.|$|E
2500|$|The perpetrator, Abraham Ukbagabir, a 36-year-old [...] Eritrean Christian, took a {{knife from}} the <b>kitchenware</b> {{department}} at IKEA in Västerås and {{began looking for}} Swedish-looking people to attack. He attacked two victims; a 55-year-old woman and her 28-year-old son, on a visit from a village outside of Skellefteå in northern Sweden. The attack was not caught on any surveillance cameras, but according to eyewitness accounts made to the Aftonbladet newspaper, the attacker stabbed the 55-year-old woman in her stomach. Her son died from wounds inflicted by the perpetrator {{when he tried to}} fend off the attack. The perpetrator then proceeded to stab himself in the stomach.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the start}} of the Second World War the English Trader played her part in {{fetching}} and carrying thousands of tons of cargo to and from the British Isles.

2500|$|Industrialization {{also caused}} social changes. The new factory working {{class in the}} cities was housed under {{generally}} poor conditions. Whole families lived in small one or two-room apartments in tenement buildings up to six stories high, badly aired and with insufficient lighting. Sometimes, they shared apartments with [...] "night sleepers", unmarried men who paid for a bed at night. The kitchen in such an apartment was often used as a living and sleeping room, and even as a bathroom. Water had to be fetched from wells and heated on the stove. Water pipes were laid only {{towards the end of}} the 19th century, and then often only with one tap per building or per story. Brick-and-mortar stoves fired with coal remained the norm until well into the second half of the century. Pots and <b>kitchenware</b> were typically stored on open shelves, and parts of the room could be separated from the rest using simple curtains.|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, {{there were}} no {{dramatic}} changes for the upper classes. The kitchen, located in the basement or the ground floor, continued to be operated by servants. In some houses, water pumps were installed, and some even had kitchen sinks and drains (but no water on tap yet, except for some feudal kitchens in castles). The kitchen became a much cleaner space {{with the advent of}} [...] "cooking machines", closed stoves made of iron plates and fired by wood and increasingly charcoal or coal, and that had flue pipes connected to the chimney. For the servants the kitchen continued to also serve as a sleeping room; they slept either on the floor, or later in narrow spaces above a lowered ceiling, for the new stoves with their smoke outlet no longer required a high ceiling in the kitchen. The kitchen floors were tiled; <b>kitchenware</b> was neatly stored in cupboards to protect them from dust and steam. A large table served as a workbench; there were at least as many chairs as there were servants, for the table in the kitchen also doubled as the eating place for the servants.|$|E
