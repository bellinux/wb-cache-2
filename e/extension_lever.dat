5000|$|Bicycles with drop {{handlebars}} {{may have}} more than one brake lever for each brake to facilitate braking from multiple hand positions. Levers that allow the rider to work the brakes from the tops of the bars, introduced in the '70s, are called <b>extension</b> <b>levers,</b> safety levers [...] or, for their reputation for being unable to actuate the full range of travel of the main brake lever, suicide levers. Modern top-mounted brake levers, called interrupt brake levers, use an entirely different method of actuation and are considered safer.|$|R
500|$|Holcroft’s {{valve gear}} design {{was also an}} attempt to address the {{problems}} associated with Gresley’s conjugated valve gear, which was prone to variations in valve events caused by heat expansion of the valve spindles within the pistons. The design utilised the motion of the outside valve rods (the rods transmitting the motion of the driving axles to the valves, such as the combination lever) instead, although the restricted space between the back of the outside cylinders and the front driving wheels made it impossible to locate the rocking arms controlling the conjugating mechanism in the vicinity. Holcroft’s solution was to move the mechanism to a position above the pony truck and ahead of the cylinders and link it to the outside valve rods with <b>extension</b> <b>levers,</b> which had to be accommodated within the strict SECR loading gauge tolerances. This necessitated a new design of cylinder block whereby the outside steam chests were set inwards {{and the size of the}} cylinders reduced to [...] stroke and diameter. [...] The sides of the outside cylinders consequently sloped inwards towards the top in a configuration similar to GWR 2-cylinder locomotives, thus providing ample space in which to accommodate the <b>extension</b> <b>levers.</b> The inside cylinder and conjugation assembly were set at an incline of 1 in 8 to clear the front pony truck, leaving space for a third set of independent Walschaerts valve gear between the frames should Holcroft’s conjugation mechanism prove unreliable in service.|$|R
50|$|Foot pedals can be raised, {{relocated}} (for instance swapped {{to be used}} by {{the opposite}} leg) or replaced with hand-controlled devices. The common form of hand controls consists of a push-pull handle mounted below and projecting {{to the side of the}} steering wheel housing. The bar connects by levers to the accelerator and brake pedals, and is typically pivoted so that pushing applies the accelerator while pulling applies the brake. As there is no facility to work a clutch pedal, hand controls must generally be used in cars with automatic transmissions. With one hand continuously engaged working the hand controls, the steering wheel will generally also be fitted with a steering knob to allow one-handed use. More complex fittings may also connect into the electronic circuitry of the vehicle to place indicator and other switches in easy reach of the driver without requiring them to release the hand controls or steering knob. A guard plate may be fitted to prevent inadvertent contact between the driver's feet and the pedals. <b>Extension</b> <b>levers</b> or adapted grips may also be fitted to the parking brake to allow it to be applied by a driver with limited hand or arm strength.|$|R
5000|$|In 1973 the Apache {{received}} a minor facelift, introducing proper CV joints, round Smiths gauges and a rod linkage for the gear shift. Originally, the ADO16 used rubber drive joints, a strip speedometer, and a remote <b>extension</b> gear <b>lever.</b> Also in 1973, the sporty TC model {{was added to}} the lineup. Power was up to [...] at 5,800 rpm, compared to [...] at 5,250 rpm for the 'cooking' versions. The TC also received Rostyle rims, vinyl roof, a rev counter, and a sporty steering wheel. All versions of the Apache and Victoria used the 1,275 cc version of BMC's venerable A-series four-cylinder, with a variety of outputs.|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} interval timing in mice that underexpress the dopamine transporter (DAT) {{and have}} chronically {{higher levels of}} extracellular dopamine (Zhuang et al., 2001). The dopaminergic system has been proposed as a neural substrate for an internal clock, with transient elevations of dopaminergic activity producing underestimation of temporal intervals. A group of DAT knockdown (KD) and littermate wild type (WT) mice were tested with a dual peak procedure. Mice obtained reinforcement by pressing one of two levers after a fixed amount of time (30 or 45 s) had elapsed since <b>lever</b> <b>extension.</b> Only one <b>lever</b> was available at a time, and each lever {{was associated with a}} single duration. On occasional probe trials, the DAT KD mice began responding earlier in the interval than WT mice, but showed maximal responding and terminated responding around {{the same time as the}} WT mice. Administration of raclopride (0. 2, 0. 6, and 1. 2 mg/kg), a D 2 antagonist, eliminated most of the differences between DAT KD and WT mice, suggesting that the effects of chronic DAT downregulation on interval timing were mediated by the D 2 receptors. Another cohort of DAT KD mice was trained on a visual attention task, and no deficits were observed, confirming that the changes in timed behavior were not attentionally mediated. Our data are consistent with the view that tonic dopamine affects the sensitivity of an organism to external reward signals, and that this increased motivation for reward of DAT KD mice lowers the threshold for initiating responding in a timing task...|$|R
40|$|Mentor: Dr. M. Carroll, and Nathan HoltzHuman {{drug addicts}} show a higher {{preference}} for sweetened dietary substances compared to non-addicts. This relationship between sweet preference and addiction vulnerability has been modeled with rats selectively bred for high (HiS) and low (LoS) saccharin intake. One question central to research on addiction {{pertains to the}} mechanism driving these phenotypic behavioral differences. Incentive salience is a phenomenon in which contextual stimuli associated with rewarding events begin to function as conditioned stimuli and elicit approach and contact behaviors, and drugs of abuse are thought to accelerate this process. Incentive salience has been modeled with animals with a procedure in which the <b>extension</b> of a <b>lever</b> acts as a cue that is immediately followed by the presentation of a noncontingent food pellet. A percentage of rats exhibit the development of incentive salience by displaying sign-tracking (ST) behavior in which they approach and bite the lever, while other rats show goal-tracking (GT) behavior in which they approach the food delivery receptacle during the <b>lever</b> <b>extension.</b> Importantly, the ST rats show greater drug-seeking compared to GT rats. Thus, in this experiment, we examined ST vs. GT behavior in HiS and LoS male and female rats to determine whether rats selectively bred to prefer sweet substances also show elevated incentive salience by demonstrating sign tracking. Results indicated no differences between ST or GT behaviors in HiS vs. LoS rats; however, females showed more ST than males, and they also show higher rates of drug-seeking than males, suggesting that sex may mediate the incentive salience process and may contribute {{to our understanding of}} sex differences in addiction vulnerability.

40|$|Problem-oriented {{policing}} {{strategies have}} {{been regarded as}} promising approaches for disrupting open-air drug markets in vulnerable communities. Pulling levers deterrence interventions, which {{are consistent with the}} problem-oriented framework, have shown potential as an effective mechanism for reducing and preventing youth, gun, and gang violence. This study examines the effect of a strategic, pulling levers intervention that was implemented by law enforcement officials in Rockford, Illinois, to address drug markets in a high crime neighborhood. The initiative builds on a similar effort developed in High Point, North Carolina, and represents an <b>extension</b> of pulling <b>levers</b> that was originally developed in Boston. The impact evaluation uses a mixed method of quantitative hierarchical growth curve models and qualitative interviews with residents. Study findings suggest that the Rockford strategy was associated with a statistically significant and substantive reduction in crime, drug, and nuisance offenses in the target neighborhood.

40|$|AbstractThe {{molecular}} motor protein myosin VI {{moves toward the}} minus-end of actin filaments with a step size of 30 – 36  nm. Such large step size either drastically limits the degree of complex formation between dimer subunits to leave enough length for the lever arms, or requires an <b>extension</b> of the <b>lever</b> arms' crystallographically observed structure. Recent experimental work proposed that myosin VI dimerization triggers the unfolding of the protein's proximal tail domain which could drive the needed lever-arm extension. Here, we demonstrate through steered molecular dynamics simulation the feasibility of sufficient extension arising from turning a three-helix bundle into a long α-helix. A key role is played by the known calmodulin binding that facilitates the extension by altering the strain path in myosin VI. Sequence analysis of the proximal tail domain suggests that further calmodulin binding sites open up when the domain's three-helix bundle is unfolded and that subsequent calmodulin binding stabilizes the extended lever arms...|$|R
40|$|Abstract 3 The {{present study}} used {{microdialysis}} techniques to compare acetylcholine release in the frontoparietal cortex of rats performing in a task requiring sustained attention {{with that of}} rats performing in two control procedures. The two control procedures were a ¢xed-interval 9 -s schedule of reinforcement assessing primarily the e¡ects of operant respond-ing and comparable reward rates, and an operant procedure designed to test the e¡ects of <b>lever</b> <b>extension</b> to prompt responding. These two control procedures involved comparable sensory-motor and motivational variables {{to those of the}} sustained attention task, but did not explicitly tax attentional processes. Performance of the sustained attention task was associated with a signi¢cant increase in cortical acetylcholine e¥ux, reaching a maximum of nearly 140 %. Performance of the two control procedures was associated with signi¢cantly smaller (V 50 %) increases in cortical acetylcholine release. This robust dissociation between attentional and control performance-associated increases in cortical acetylcholine release resulted, in part, from the elimination of the pre-task transfer of the animals into the operant chambers and the associated increases in acetylcholine release observed in previous studies. The present results support the hypothesis that demands on attentional performance, as opposed to the frequency of lever pressing, reward delivery and other task-related variables, selectively activate the basal forebrain corticopetal cholinergic system. @ 2002 IBRO.

40|$|Stimuli {{paired with}} rewards acquire {{reinforcing}} properties to promote reward-seeking behavior. Previous work supports {{the role of}} ventral tegmental area (VTA) nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in mediating conditioned reinforcement elicited by drug-associated cues. However, {{it is not known}} whether these cholinergic mechanisms are specific to drug-associated cues or whether VTA cholinergic mechanisms also underlie the ability of cues paired with natural rewards to act as conditioned reinforcers. Burst firing of VTA dopamine (DA) neurons and the subsequent phasic DA release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) {{plays an important role in}} cue-mediated behavior and in the ability of cues to acquire reinforcing properties. In the VTA, both AChRs and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) regulate DA burst firing and phasic DA release. Here, we tested the role of VTA nAChRs, muscarinic AChRs (mAChRs), and NMDARs in the conditioned reinforcement elicited by a food-associated, natural reward cue. Subjects received 10 consecutive days of Pavlovian conditioning training where <b>lever</b> <b>extension</b> served as a predictive cue for food availability. On day 11, rats received bilateral VTA infusion of saline, AP- 5 (0. 1 or 1 μg), mecamylamine (MEC: 3 or 30 μg) or scopolamine (SCOP: 3 or 66. 7 μg) immediately prior to the conditioned reinforcement test. During the test, nosepoking into the active (conditioned reinforced, CR) noseport produced a lever cue while nosepoking on the inactive (non-conditioned reinforced, NCR) noseport had no consequence. AP- 5 robustly attenuated conditioned reinforcement and blocked discrimination between CR and NCR noseports at the 1 -μg dose. MEC infusion decreased responding for both CR and NCR while 66. 7 -μg SCOP disrupted the subject's ability to discriminate between CR and NCR. Together, our data suggest that VTA NMDARs and mAChRs, but not nAChRs, play a role in the ability of natural reward-associated cues to act as conditioned reinforcers...|$|R
40|$|Striatal {{dopamine}} (DA) plays {{a central}} role in reward-related learning and behavioral adaptation to changing environments. Recent studies suggest that rather than being broadcast as a uniform signal throughout the entire region, DA release dynamics diverge between different striatal regions. In a previous study, we showed that phasic DA release patterns in the ventromedial striatum (VMS) rapidly adapt during reversal learning. However, it is unknown how DA dynamics in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) are modulated during such adaptive behavior. Here, we used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to measure phasic DA release in the DLS during spatial reversal learning. In the DLS, we observed minor DA release after the onset of a visual cue signaling reward availability, followed by more pronounced DA release during more proximal reward cues (e. g., <b>lever</b> <b>extension)</b> and execution of the operant response (i. e., lever press), both in rewarded and non-rewarded trials. These release dynamics (minor DA after onset of the predictive visual cue, prominent DA during the operant response) did not change significantly during or following a reversal of response-reward contingencies. Notably, the DA increase to the lever press did not reflect a general signal related to the initiation of any motivated motor response, as we did not observe DA release when rats initiated nose pokes into the food receptacle during inter-trial intervals. This suggests that DA release in the DLS occurs selectively during the initiation and execution of a learned operant response. Together with our previous results obtained in the VMS, these findings reveal distinct phasic DA release patterns during adaptation of established behavior in DLS and VMS. The VMS DA signal, which is highly sensitive to reversal of response-reward contingences, may provide a teaching signal to guide reward-related learning and facilitate behavioral adaptation, whereas DLS DA may reflect a 'response execution signal' largely independent of outcome, that may be involved in initiation and energizing of operant behavior...|$|R
40|$|In {{microsystems}} technology suitable microjoint {{mechanisms are}} required {{in order to}} transfer the work of microactuators into directed forces and motions. In this work this problem is solved by making use of the hydraulic principle of spider leg extension, which is implemented in active microjoints. Due to the high power density of fluidic actuators a compact design become possible. Such active microjoints are very promising for use in microsystems technology, since they can be arranged as basic modules in series or in parallel to complex motion systems, which can be controlled by micropumps and microvalves. In order to gain better insight, a model is developed for simulation of the dynamic behavior of a revolute joint mechanism taking into account damping and frictional forces. The dynamics of the contact point and the center of gravity of the joint lever is analysed for different circular and elliptical joint geometries of millimeter size in the presence of gravitation. It is demonstrated that by geometry variation the frictional work can be reduced at least by 10 %, which is an important criterion for the optimisation of such an element. The technical feasibility of fluidic microjoints is investigated and a concept for fabrication is worked out for prototypes of dimensions 1 x 1 x 6 mm" 3. The metallic levers of the joint mechanism are manufactured with an accuracy of #+-# 5 #mu#m by electron-discharge machining. The high wettability of liquid SIR enables the fabrication of a flexible hinge by a vacuum casting process, whereby the anchoring structure with minimum gap width of 85 #mu#m can be filled up in a reproducible manner. The thin-walled capsule of the microjoint is fabricated by a blow moulding process. During shaping, the wall thickness of the tubular parison is reduced from 100 to 50 #mu#m. Alternatively, some other technologies like a process with lost cores, dip coating and injection molding with inlays are investigated. Furthermore, a non-positive joint is designed as a further linking mechanism in addition to positive joints and flexible hinges. In experimental investigations the elastic bending behavior of the hinge and the joint capsule are characterised by force-displacement measurements. The hinges of SIR allow a rotating movement of about 45, which requires maximum bending forces of about 0, 5 - 3 mN {{depending on the type of}} SIR and the deformation velocity. In order to fold the blown capsule, bending forces of about 5 mN are required. The pneumatic driving forces are measured during <b>lever</b> <b>extension</b> display a maximum value of about 16 mN for a pressure difference of 1000 hPa. The corresponding displacement of the lever tip is about 1, 8 mm. (orig.) Dissertation submitted by M.
