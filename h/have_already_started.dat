25|$|Discussing {{the issue}} in Morocco has been taboo for decades. However, human rights {{organizations}} and some liberal media outlets and left-wing political parties led by the Front of Democratic Forces have been attempting to start a capital punishment debate.

The main and the newly created (2003) civil entity Coalition nationale pour l’abolition de la peine de mort au Maroc (CNAPM) (National coalition for the abolition of capital punishment in Morocco) which represents seven associations carrying the slogan Ensemble pour l'abolition de la peine de mort (Together against capital punishment) is also leading the debate.|$|E

25|$|By August 2017, {{preliminary}} {{work on the}} line was underway, and the engineering firm AKRF was updating the environmental impact study for Phase 2. AKRF had previously prepared the Manhattan East Side Alternatives and the original EIS for the Second Avenue Subway. The design of the project is being done by Phase 2 Partnership, a joint venture of Parsons-Brinckerhoff and STV. The EIS and design will be finished in 2018. A Second Avenue Subway Community Information Center for Phase 2, along 125th Street between Park and Madison Avenues, was planned to open in May 2017; however, the center's opening was delayed to September 18, 2017. Workers <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>started</b> testing the ground and buildings along the route looking for utilities. The MTA requested federal funds to start the relocation of utilities, {{the construction of the}} launch box for the TBMs, and for the management of the construction.|$|E
25|$|The {{report also}} {{highlights}} India's inefficient energy consumption and mentions the dramatic under-representation of these {{economies in the}} global capital markets. The report also emphasizes the enormous populations that exist within the BRIC nations, which makes it relatively easy for their aggregate wealth to eclipse the G6, while per-capita income levels remain far below the norm of today's industrialized countries. This phenomenon, too, will affect world markets as multinational corporations will attempt {{to take advantage of}} the enormous potential markets in the BRICs by producing, for example, far cheaper automobiles and other manufactured goods affordable to the consumers within the BRICs in lieu of the luxury models that currently bring the most income to automobile manufacturers. India and China <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>started</b> making their presence felt in the service and manufacturing sector respectively in the global arena. Developed economies of the world have already taken serious note of this fact.|$|E
25|$|The hyper-competition in telecom market, {{which was}} {{effectively}} {{caused by the}} introduction of Universal Access Service (UAS) licence in 2003 became much tougher after 3G and 4G competitive auction. About 670,000 route-kilometer (419,000-mile) of optical fibres has been laid in India by the major operators, including in the financially nonviable rural areas and the process continues. Keeping in mind the viability of providing services in rural areas, the government of India also took a proactive role to promote the NGN implementation in the country; an expert committee called NGN eCO was constituted in order to deliberate on the licensing, interconnection and Quality of Service (QoS) issues related to NGN and it submitted its report on 24 August 2007. Telecom operators found the NGN model advantageous, but huge investment requirements have prompted them to adopt a multi-phase migration and they <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>started</b> the migration process to NGN with the implementation of IP-based core-network.|$|E

500|$|In 1474, Edward granted William {{the right}} to crenellate, or fortify, four of his manors and to build deer parks around them. William set about {{developing}} the old manorial complex at Ashby de la Zouch with new buildings, and was authorised to create a huge [...] park around it. His intent {{appears to have been}} to construct a substantial castle, similar to the royal fortifications at Tutbury and Nottingham, with four huge towers. Work appears to <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>started</b> on the site the year before permission was formally given, although it is uncertain whether this referred to the construction of the castle's chapel, or if William had already begun work on the first tower, gambling that the King would subsequently approve it.|$|E
500|$|A third {{series was}} {{announced}} on 27 September 2010, commissioned by BBC Learning, {{as part of}} a new BBC strategy to provide learning opportunities for all audiences. Saul Nassé, Controller of Learning, said, [...] "I want to use BBC programmes that are known and loved by audiences that can serve as springboards for learning. [...] We'll be enlisting the help of the BBC's best talent to maximise the reach of our output," [...] and Sathe commented, [...] "We are thrilled with the success of the first two series and <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>started</b> to storyline the third. Be prepared for a few familiar faces, a couple of new ones and a lot of fireworks." [...] It was confirmed that Learning would fund the third series and work with young people to develop storylines [...] "that bring to life subjects in the Personal, Social, Health Education (PSHE) curriculum such as bullying or peer pressure." [...] A regional schools tour was organised to tie in with the launch of the series, with pupils writing short scenes based on scenarios tying in with the PSHE curriculum, which were performed, filmed and edited. Sarah Miller, BBC Learning commissioner and executive producer of series 3, explained: [...] "The schools tour was a terrific opportunity to deliver powerful face-to-face workshops, giving students and teachers the opportunity to develop key media production skills and to get behind the scenes of a top BBC drama." ...|$|E

The first Mass in 9 years was celebrated on January 27, 2002, for members of the International Security Force and various members of foreign agencies. On May 16, 2002, a mission sui iuris was created for all of Afghanistan. There is only one functioning chapel in the country, in the Italian Embassy in Kabul. Projects of the new mission include a [...] "Peace School" [...] for 500 students that began construction in August 2003 and will be to [...] "European standards". Three religious sisters also work with those who have mental disabilities in the capital city, teaching those with cerebral palsy how to go to the toilet and how to eat on their own. The small community went through a period of crisis during the kidnapping on May 17, 2005, of Clementina Cantoni, a member of CARE International, by four gunmen in Kabul as she walked to her car.

[...] "Aura's Motala Project covers approximately 140 square kilometres of the Alum Shale. [...] Dr Beeson said he was very excited about the project's potential, particularly as the Motala shale may share some similarities with a highly successful play in North America. [...] "Gas flows of up to 50 cubic metres per hour have been reported from drill holes used to extract water, so it is definitely worth investigation," [...] he said.
