5|$|In {{response}} to the flooding in St. John's, Newfoundland, the city mayor activated the city's Emergency Preparedness Program. On September 27, {{about a week after}} the passage of the storm, the <b>Emergency</b> <b>Measures</b> Organization began accepting applications for flood-related damage. By about a month after the storm, 169 applications were processed, with an additional 1,762 received by the <b>Emergency</b> <b>Measures</b> Organization. Eligibility for the disaster assistance included restoration to property or household items of an essential nature. A few days after the passage of the storm, the government of Newfoundland appealed to the federal government for federal disaster relief fund; the government later approved. Ultimately, disaster relief assistance totaled $6.3million (2001 CAD), primarily to individual assistance.|$|E
5|$|Municipalities in New Brunswick may {{incorporate}} {{under the}} Municipalities Act of 1973 as a city, town, village, regional municipality, or rural community. Municipal governments {{are led by}} elected councils and {{are responsible for the}} delivery of services such as civic administration, land use planning, <b>emergency</b> <b>measures,</b> policing, road, and garbage collection. New Brunswick has 8 cities, 26 towns, 65 villages, 1 regional municipality, and 7 rural communities. Although rural communities are under the Municipalities Act, the provincial government distinguishes them from municipalities.|$|E
5|$|New Brunswick's {{first and}} only {{regional}} municipality was incorporated on May 12, 2014. The Regional Municipality of Tracadie was formed through the amalgamation of the former Town of Tracadie–Sheila, eighteen local service districts and portions of two other local service districts. Regional municipalities must have a population greater than 15,000 and a community grouping that includes at least one municipality. Regional municipalities elect a local council but are responsible only for community administration, planning and <b>emergency</b> <b>measures</b> services, and all services previously provided by any former municipality that {{is now part of}} the regional municipality. The Province of New Brunswick is responsible for police protection and road services, unless the regional municipality chooses to assume these responsibilities.|$|E

5|$|As chancellor, Hitler {{worked against}} {{attempts}} by the NSDAP's opponents to build a majority government. Because of the political stalemate, he asked Hindenburg to again dissolve the Reichstag, and elections were scheduled for early March. On 27 February 1933, the Reichstag building was set on fire. Göring blamed a communist plot, because Dutch communist Marinus van der Lubbe was found in incriminating circumstances inside the burning building. According to Kershaw, the consensus of nearly all historians is that van der Lubbe actually set the fire. Others, including William L. Shirer and Alan Bullock, are {{of the opinion that}} the NSDAP itself was responsible. At Hitler's urging, Hindenburg responded with the Reichstag Fire Decree of 28 February, which suspended basic rights and allowed detention without trial. The decree was permitted under Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution, which gave the president the power to take <b>emergency</b> <b>measures</b> to protect public safety and order. Activities of the German Communist Party (KPD) were suppressed, and some 4,000 KPD members were arrested.|$|E
5|$|Just a {{week after}} Hurricane Juan hit Nova Scotia, the Newfoundland and Labrador <b>Emergency</b> <b>Measures</b> Organization advised the general public to take {{appropriate}} actions for the anticipated effects of Hurricane Kate, including high winds and potentially up to 3in (80mm) of rain. Such actions include securing loose objects, cleaning debris from storm drains, and owning appropriate hurricane supplies (such as a charged cell phone and batteries {{in the event of}} power outages). A cruise ship scheduled to stop in St. John's bypassed Newfoundland to avoid the storm. The Newfoundland and Maritimes Weather Center issued a storm warning for Newfoundland, while the Canadian Hurricane Centre issued a hurricane-force wind warning. Due to the expected combination of moisture from Kate and a cold front, the Canadian Hurricane Centre also issued a heavy rainfall warning for southeastern Newfoundland. Offshore, waves were expected to reach 33feet (10m), while marine wind warnings were issued as well.|$|E
5|$|New Brunswick seven rural communities, an {{increase}} from four {{as of the}} 2011 census following the incorporations of Kedgwick in 2012 and Cocagne and Hanwell in 2014. These seven rural communities had a cumulative population of 19,616 in the 2016 Census. New Brunswick's largest and smallest rural communities are Beaubassin East and Saint-André with populations of 6,376 and 772 respectively. Rural communities elect local councils and {{are responsible for the}} delivery of some local services, including administrative services, community planning and <b>emergency</b> <b>measures.</b> The province of New Brunswick ensures the delivery of other services including solid waste collection and recreation services unless the rural community chooses to take on these responsibilities. Rural communities that include a former village or town are an exception, as they are responsible to provide all services that were previously provided by their former municipality.|$|E

5|$|On 6 October, {{a number}} of private interbank credit {{facilities}} to Icelandic banks were shut down. Prime Minister Geir Haarde addressed the nation in a speech that became infamous for its portentous closing words: 'God bless Iceland'. He announced a package of new regulatory measures which were {{to be put to}} the Althing, Iceland's parliament, immediately, with the cooperation of the opposition parties. These included the power of the FME to take over the running of Icelandic banks without nationalising them, and preferential treatment for depositors in the event that a bank had to be liquidated. In a separate measure, retail deposits in Icelandic branches of Icelandic banks were guaranteed in full. The <b>emergency</b> <b>measures</b> had been deemed unnecessary by the Icelandic government less than 24 hours earlier.|$|E
5|$|The Eisenhower–Johnson Memorial Tunnel {{was known}} as the Straight Creek Tunnel during construction, named for the {{waterway}} that runs along the western approach to the tunnel. Before the tunnel was dedicated, it was renamed to honor Dwight D. Eisenhower and Edwin C. Johnson. Construction on the first bore of the tunnel was started on March 15, 1968. Construction efforts suffered many setbacks and the project went well over time and budget. One of the biggest setbacks was the discovery of fault lines {{in the path of the}} tunnel that were not discovered during the pilot bores. These faults began to slip during construction and <b>emergency</b> <b>measures</b> had to be taken to protect the tunnels and workers from cave-ins and collapses. Despite the best efforts of engineers, three workers were killed boring the first tube, and four in boring the second.|$|E
5|$|The Partition of Bengal in 1905 {{initiated}} the Swadeshi movement, {{which led to}} the boycotting of British goods in India. On 22 July 1908, Lokmanya Tilak, the principal advocate of the Swadeshi movement in Bombay, was sentenced to six years rigorous imprisonment, on the charge of writing inflammatory articles against the Government in his newspaper Kesari. The arrest led to huge scale protests across the city. The Bombay Chronicle started by Pherozeshah Mehta, the leader of the Indian National Congress, in 1910, {{played an important role in}} the national movement until India's Independence. Lord Willingdon convened the Provincial War Conference at Bombay on 10 June 1918, whose objective was to seek the co-operation of the people in the World War I measures which the British Government thought it necessary to take in the Bombay Presidency. The conference was followed by huge rallies across the city. The worldwide influenza epidemic raged through Bombay from September to December 1918, causing hundreds of deaths per day. The Lord Willingdon Memorial incident of December 1918 saw the handicap of Home Rulers in Bombay. The first important strike in the textile industry in Bombay began in January 1919. Bombay was the main centre of the Rowlatt Satyagraha movement started by Mahatma Gandhi from February— April 1919. The movement was started as a result of the Rowlatt Act, which indefinitely extended <b>emergency</b> <b>measures</b> during World War I in order to control public unrest.|$|E

5|$|The first {{televised}} prime ministerial {{debate was}} organised by the state-owned broadcaster Finnish Broadcasting Company on 31 March in Tampere and included the chairpersons {{of the four}} parties leading in the opinion polls. The European sovereign debt crisis featured prominently in the debate; {{the leaders of the}} governing coalition, Katainen and Kiviniemi, defended Finland's participation in guaranteeing the loans to crisis-ridden EU countries claiming that Finland would otherwise risk plunging into a new recession as the country is dependent on exports to other European countries. As the chairpersons of the leading opposition parties, Soini and Urpilainen denied this claim and insisted that the debt-ridden countries should rather be allowed to go into their own debt restructuring. Urpilainen was not entirely against <b>emergency</b> <b>measures</b> aimed at saving these countries, but insisted that the major European banks ought to play a larger role in the guarantees. Soini continued his criticism of the euro, reiterating that no referendum was ever called on the currency union — he remained steadfast on his party's opposition to Finland guaranteeing the loans and presented the upcoming election as a referendum on the issue. On other economic issues, Kiviniemi continued to insist that spending cuts are not necessary in the following years — a claim repudiated by the other party leaders. Urpilainen and, initially, also Katainen were willing to make cuts on military spending; Soini, however, contested the cut but was instead ready to cut development aid and immigration-related expenses.|$|E
5|$|The {{occupation}} of Czechoslovakia by Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany in March 1939 convinced Huggins that war was imminent. Seeking to renew his government's mandate to pass <b>emergency</b> <b>measures,</b> he called an early election {{in which his}} United Party won an increased majority. Huggins rearranged his Cabinet on a war footing, making the Minister of Justice Robert Tredgold Minister of Defence as well. The territory proposed forces not only for internal security {{but also for the}} defence of British interests overseas. Self-contained Rhodesian formations were planned, including a mechanised reconnaissance unit, but Tredgold opposed this. Remembering the catastrophic casualties suffered by units such as the Newfoundland Regiment and the South African Brigade on the Western Front in World War I, he argued that one or two heavy defeats for a white Southern Rhodesian brigade might cause crippling losses and have irrevocable effects on the country as a whole. He proposed to instead concentrate on training white Rhodesians for leadership roles and specialist units, and to disperse the colony's men across the forces in small groups. These ideas met with approval in both Salisbury and London and were adopted.|$|E
5|$|Economists have {{referred}} to the onset of World War I {{as the end of}} an age of innocence for foreign exchange markets, as it was the first geopolitical conflict to have a destabilizing and paralyzing impact. The United Kingdom declared war on Germany on August 4, 1914 following Germany's invasion of France and Belgium. In the weeks prior, the foreign exchange market in London was the first to exhibit distress. European tensions and increasing political uncertainty motivated investors to chase liquidity, prompting commercial banks to borrow heavily from London's discount market. As the money market tightened, discount lenders began rediscounting their reserves at the Bank of England rather than discounting new pounds sterling. The Bank of England was forced to raise discount rates daily for three days from 3% on July 30 to 10% by August 1. As foreign investors resorted to buying pounds for remittance to London just to pay off their newly maturing securities, the sudden demand for pounds led the pound to appreciate beyond its gold value against most major currencies, yet sharply depreciate against the French franc after French banks began liquidating their London accounts. Remittance to London became increasingly difficult and culminated in a record exchange rate of $6.50 USD/GBP. <b>Emergency</b> <b>measures</b> were introduced in the form of moratoria and extended bank holidays, but to no effect as financial contracts became informally unable to be negotiated and export embargoes thwarted gold shipments. A week later, the Bank of England began to address the deadlock in the foreign exchange markets by establishing a new channel for transatlantic payments whereby participants could make remittance payments to the U.K. by depositing gold designated for a Bank of England account with Canada's Minister of Finance, and in exchange receive pounds sterling at an exchange rate of $4.90. Approximately $104 million USD in remittances flowed through this channel in the next two months. However, pound sterling liquidity ultimately did not improve due to inadequate relief for merchant banks receiving sterling bills. As the pound sterling was the world's reserve currency and leading vehicle currency, market illiquidity and merchant banks' hesitance to accept sterling bills left currency markets paralyzed.|$|E
