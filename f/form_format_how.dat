To {{solve the problems of}} large encoded data storage space, data update and low query effi-ciency, we propose a new encoding scheme named SDUE (Supporting Data Update Efficiently). We tried to decompose the encoding node location information, avoiding recording redundant information, thus effectively saves storage space; moreover, SDUE also effectively support data updates. In the area of query, since record-taking point SDUE path infor-mation encoded {{in the path of the}} query, which avoided the structural join operations, query efficiency has been improved efficiently. Experimental results show that compared with other coding, SDUE coded has obvious advantages such as storage space utilization, efficiency query and nodes update speed...|$|R

The XFDF specification is referenced (but not included) in PDF 1.5 specification (and in later versions). It is described separately in XML <b>Forms</b> Data <b>Format</b> Specification. The PDF 1.4 specification allowed form submissions in XML format, but this was replaced by submissions in XFDF format in the PDF 1.5 specification. XFDF conforms to the XML standard.|$|R
