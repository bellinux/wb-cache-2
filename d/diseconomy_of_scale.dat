40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} efficiency structure hypothesis {{holds true for}} Japanese major commercial banks using a panel data set covering the period from fiscal year 1974 to 2001. The efficiency structure hypothesis has been hitherto mostly examined {{in comparison with the}} structure-conduct-performance (SCP) hypothesis in the framework that determines which of the two measurements - the degree of market concentration or market shares - better explains market performance such as profits and interest rates. In this paper, we point out some problems of this framework and examine the efficiency structure hypothesis in a more straightforward manner by focusing on the proposition that the more efficient a bank the more it grows. First, we estimated organizational inefficiencies and the <b>diseconomy</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> for each major bank using the panel data set.

The regression analysis, in which the organizational inefficiencies and the <b>diseconomy</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> in the preceding fiscal year are linked to the reduced-form equation for bank loans, has found that organization inefficiencies adversely affect the amount of bank loans, just as expected.

40|$|The {{research}} tests Oliver Williamson’s {{proposition that}} transaction cost economics {{can explain the}} limits of firm size. Williamson suggests that <b>diseconomies</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> are manifested through four interrelated factors: atmospheric consequences due to specialisation, bureaucratic insularity, incentive limits of the employment relation and communication distortion due to bounded rationality. Furthermore, Williamson argues that <b>diseconomies</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> are counteracted by economies <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> and can be moderated by adoption of the multidivisional organisation form and by high internal asset specificity. Combined, these influences tend to cancel out and thus {{there is not a}} strong, directly observable, relationship between a large firm’s size and performance. A review of the relevant literature, including transaction cost economics, sociological studies of bureaucracy, information-processing perspectives on the firm, agency theory, and studies of incentives and motivation within firms, as well as empirical studies of trends in firm size and industry concentration, corroborates Williamson’s theoretical framework and translates it into five hypotheses: (1) Bureaucratic failure, in the form of atmospheric consequences, bureaucratic insularity, incentive limits and communication distortion, increases with firm size; (2) Large firms exhibit economies <b>of</b> scale; (3) <b>Diseconomies</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> from bureaucratic failure {{have a negative impact on}} firm performance; (4) Economies <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> increase the relative profitability of large firms over smaller firms; and (5) <b>Diseconomies</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> are moderated by two transaction cost-related factors: organisation form and asset specificity. The hypotheses are tested by applying structural equation models to primary and secondary cross-sectional data from 784 large U. S. manufacturing firms. The statistical analyses confirm the hypotheses. Thus, <b>diseconomies</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> influence the growth and profitability of firms negatively, while economies <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> and the moderating factors have positive influences. This implies that executives and directors of large firms should pay attention to bureaucratic failure. bureaucratic failure, <b>diseconomies</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale,</b> transaction cost economics...|$|R

For a given transport fluid and collector conditions, the method determines the network pipe diameter and pipe thickness distribution and also insulation thickness distribution associated with minimum system cost; these relative distributions are unique. Transport losses, including pump work and heat leak, are calculated operating expenses and impact the total system cost. The minimum cost system is readily selected.

40|$|A {{software}} development manager will often {{need to make}} decisions about the allocation of resources across a number of different development projects. These projects may vary in size, in importance, and in the potential value to the organisation of the software that is to be produced. Based upon these and other considerations, a manager might consider an increase in the resource allocation for a particular project. They might also consider changing the size of a planned software release by including or excluding a number of features. In doing this, the manager will need to consider economies, or diseconomies, of scale: if a project is given twice the resources, will the software be delivered in half the time? Will a particular project remain on schedule, despite a headcount reduction of 50 %, if the size of the next deliverable is reduced also by 50 %? If a software product would earn the company a certaiD amount if delivered in one month, and a lesser amount if delivered after that time, how much resource should be allocated to its development? Existing effort prediction models provide some guidance, but fail to agree about the extent, or even the existence, of economies and diseconomies of scale. The models are also limited to effort and scheduling predictions for a single project; there is no provision for the optimization of resource allocation, release sizing, and release scheduling across a portfolio of projects. This dissertation uses a new prediction model, derived from a large database of empirical results, to show the existence of an economy of scale with respect to project size, and a <b>diseconomy</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> with respect to team size. It uses this model as a basis for the comparison and validation of the two leading prediction models, and shows that a failure to address the <b>diseconomy</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> to team size can lead to significant errors. Drawing upon the tools and techniques of financial portfolio management, the model is used as the basis of an "economic framework" for {{software development}} optimization, a set of tools for optimizing resource allocation and release sizing across a portfolio of projects, in terms of the net value obtained from the software produced. This framework is extended to address declining marginal value and to provide an indication of risk and variability across a project portfolio.

In particular, there has been considerable discussion of whether standards and regulations affect trade costs and export prospects for developing countries. In this paper the authors examine how meeting foreign standards affects firms'export performance, reflected in export propensity and market diversification. The analysis draws on the World Bank Technical Barriers to Trade Survey database of 619 firms in 17 developing countries. The results indicate that technical regulations in industrial countries adversely affect firms'propensity to export in developing countries. In particular, testing procedures and lengthy inspection procedures reduce exports by 9 percent and 3 percent, respectively. Furthermore, in the model, the difference in standards across foreign countries causes <b>diseconomy</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> for firms and affects decisions about whether to enter export markets. The empirical analysis presented here implies that standards impede exporters'market entry, reducing the likelihood of exporting to more than three markets by 7 percent.

The" theory makes cross-sectional predictions on which firms will choose to produce insurance, as well as how prices and loss experience will vary with the production decision; the theory also predicts which lines of insurance are likely to be associated with internal production and those in which coverage will be provided entirely by the market. Furthermore, the time-series properties of claims under various degrees of internal" production are analyzed, revealing a more pronounced lag structure for claims under partial risk-bearing than under full self-insurance or market insurance. These predictions are generated by a fundamental <b>diseconomy</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> that offsets the standard scale economy associated with risk-pooling.

40|$|We study {{capacity}} reservation {{contracts in}} high-tech manufacturing, where the manufacturer (the supplier) shares {{the risk of}} capacity expansion with her OEM customer (the buyer). We focus on short-life-cycle, make-to-order products under stochastic demand. The supplier and the buyer are partners who enter a "design-win " agreement to develop the product, and who share demand information. The supplier would expand her capacity in any case, but reservation may encourage her to expand more aggressively. To reserve capacity, the buyer pays a fee upfront while (a pre-specified portion of) the fee is deductible from the order payment. As capacity expansion demonstrates <b>diseconomy</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> in this context, we assume convex capacity costs. We first analyze the players ' incentives {{as a means to}} evaluating the value of reservation. We show that as the buyer's revenue margin decreases, the supplier faces a sequence of four profit scenarios with decreasing desirability. We examine the effects of market size and demand variability to the contract conditions, and show that it is the demand variability that affects the reservation fee, and that the convex cost assumption leads to somewhat different insights than the linear cost cases in the literature. We propose two channel coordination contracts, and discuss how such contracts can be tailored for situations where the supplier has the option of not complying with the contract, and when the buyer's demand information is only partially updated during the supplier's capacity lead time. We conclude the paper by summarizing insights useful for high-tech capacity management. 1...|$|E
