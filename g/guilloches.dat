2500|$|The Cosmati were a Roman family, seven {{members of}} which, for four generations, were skilful architects, sculptors and workers in {{decorative}} geometric mosaic, mostly for church floors. Their name is commemorated in {{the genre of}} Cosmatesque work, often just called [...] "Cosmati", a technique of opus sectile ("cut work") formed of elaborate inlays of small triangles and rectangles of colored stones and glass mosaics set into stone matrices or encrusted upon stone surfaces. Bands, panels and shaped reserves of intricate mosaic alternate with contrasting bands, <b>guilloches</b> and simple geometric shapes of plain white marble. Pavements and revetments were executed in Cosmatesque technique, columns were inlaid with fillets and bands, and immovable church furnishings like cathedras and ambones were similarly treated.|$|E

5000|$|The Landscape Room: Is 20 ft square, the {{fireplace}} is of white marble with inlaid panels of coloured marble, {{the walls are}} covered in patterned red Damask, the plaster ceiling is divided into nine compartments the central one an octagon, divided by plaster beams decorated with a <b>guilloch</b> pattern with rosettes where the beams cross. The four doors, flanking {{the fireplace}} and in the centres of {{the east and west}} walls have entablatures. There is a Venetian window with Corinthian columns and pilasters. The dado, ceiling and door surrounds are white highlighted in gilt. The furniture consists of a small desk and two carved gilt, two seater sofas upholstered in red velvet and a pair of torchieres flank the fireplace.|$|R
5000|$|She {{was buried}} in the {{necropolis}} of Saint Denis. Her funeral was exceptionally long, lasting 40 days, and it inspired all future French royal funerals until the 18th century. On this occasion, the Herald of arms of Brittany Pierre Choqué pronounced {{for the first time the}} traditional lament: La reine est morte!, la reine est morte!, la reine est morte! (The Queen is dead!, The Queen is dead!, The Queen is dead!). Choqué also recorded that two Masses were read, the first by the Cordeliers (i.e., Franciscans) and the second by the Jacobins (i.e., Dominicans). Two requiems were also sung, possibly those that survive by Johannes Prioris and Antoine de Févin. Separate mourning motets by other members of the two royal choirs also survive: Quis dabit oculis by Costanzo Festa and Fiere attropos by Pierre Moulu.According to her will, Anne's heart was placed in a raised enamel gold reliquary, then transported to Nantes to be deposited in her parents' tomb in the chapel of the Carmelite friars. This was done on 19 March 1514, but it was later transferred to the Saint-Pierre Cathedral. Anne's reliquary is a bivalvular box oval articulated by a hinge, made of a sheet of gold pushed back and <b>guillochéd,</b> broadside of a gold [...] and topped by a crown of lily and clover. It is inscribed on the obverse as follows: ...|$|R

50|$|Parterres are the low embellishments of gardens, {{which have}} great grace, {{especially}} when seen from an elevated position: {{they are made}} of borders of several shrubs and sub-shrubs of various colours, fashioned in different manners, as compartments, foliage, embroideries (passements), moresques, arabesques, grotesques, <b>guilloches,</b> rosettes, sunbursts (gloires), escutcheons, coats-of-arms, monograms and emblems (devises).|$|E
50|$|In West Germany an {{improved}} identity card {{was developed in}} the 1980s and issued from April 1987 on. The card consisted of a single laminated sheet of paper with a machine-readable zone. To prevent counterfeiting, it contained watermarks, <b>guillochés,</b> microprinting, fluorescent dyes, and multi-colour fluorescent fibres. In addition, the holder's name was laser engraved into the plastic film and the holder's picture was printed on the document, so it could not be removed and replaced by a different one (unlike the older ID cards, where the picture was just glued to the document).|$|E

5000|$|The {{palace and}} gardens were built {{during the reign}} of Muhammad III (1302-1309) and redecorated shortly after by Abu I-Walid Isma'il (1313-1324). Much of the garden is a recent {{reconstruction}} of dubious authenticity. Théophile Gautier, a mid-19th century visitor, complained that: [...] Of the Generalife nothing now remains but some arcades and some large panels of arabesques, unfortunately plastered over with layers of whitewash that have been applied again and again with all the obstinacy of a dispiriting cleanliness. Little by little the delicate sculptures and the marvellous <b>guilloches</b> of this fairy-like architecture have been obliterated, filled up, and engulfed. What is at present nothing more than a faintly-vermiculated wall, was formerly open lace-work as fine as those ivory leaves which the patience of the Chinese carves for fans.|$|E
50|$|The Great Audience Hall {{was built}} {{with a special}} eye to {{external}} effect, and this object was attained by carving and gilding all the wooden parts of the roofs-except the panels between the two roofs, which were merely gilt-that is, the gables, barge-boards and eaves-boards. The carving is in low relief and consists principally of a lotus and foliage-band on the eaves-boards; the barge-boards are ornamented with a plain scroll design and surmounted by flamboyant which are very effective as a decoration. But the wealth of ornamentation is lavished on {{the corners of the}} hipped roofs and the points of the gables as well as their lower extremities. The corners of the hipped (lower) roofs are surmounted by two wooden boards, made up of several joined piecesand meeting so as to form a right angle at the corner; the chief motifs are flamboyant, foliage, lotus-bands and <b>guilloches.</b>|$|E
40|$|Local Name: Ağaçarası Tepesi or Alagüz Tepesi, Yeniköy areaLatitude: 37. 44. 21. 24 Longitude: 28. 48. 55. 08 Elevation: 1232 mAxis: 145 degreesDimensions: H. max: 1. 80 m ** L. north wall: approx. 8 mDescription: Oriented roughly northeast–southwest, {{the chapel}} is asmall, single-nave {{structure}} with the apse {{toward the east}} and perhaps a narthex toward the west. The extant walls are buried under as much as 2. 0 m of loose stone, brick, and rubble, perhaps from the collapsed vault or semidome of the building. Along the apse, the inner face of the wall is visible to a height 1. 1 m above the present ground surface, as is a single bench synthronon (H: 0. 30 m), both exposed by illicit excavations. Numerous fragments of roof tiles and marble paving stones are {{mixed in with the}} debris. The side walls are built of unmortared schist with some brick inclusions. The rubble masonry of the apse and synthronon (W: 0. 70 m), however, is heavily mortared, and the joints between the stones are scored (Fig. 21). The full 0. 8 m thickness of the side walls can be measured only at {{what appears to be the}} dividing wall between the nave and the narthex; the maximum preserved height is 0. 8 m, and the wall is exposed for 1. 1 m. Robber's pits along the north wall have exposed some other construction details, including the inner wall of the apse and the foundations of the synthronon. From the southeast end of the apse, the outer wall runs to the southeast at a right angle to the apse wall for at least 1. 4 m, probably connecting the naos to a side chamber. A platform about 8 m wide extends the length of the southern (downhill) side of the chapel and perhaps indicates the presence of an ancillary structure there. ** Fragments of the church's marble decoration that have survived in the area include a doorjamb found in front of an abandoned house not far from the church in 2005 but not seen again in subsequent visits. Nearby was a fragment of a marble screen panel showing the lower arm of a lobed cross together with an unidentified motif, perhaps a stylized cypress tree (A 071) (H: 0. 47 m; W: 0. 30 m; D: 0. 08 m). Both the doorjamb and the screen panel could be from this church. The decoration of the jamb block is typically Middle Byzantine; one side is profiled, and the front is carved with interlocked chains of <b>guilloches</b> and lozenges. This design is comparable to the decoration of architectural features that were part of the renovation of the Cathedral in Aphrodisias, dated to the tenth century...|$|E
