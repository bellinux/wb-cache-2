50|$|Road rollers use {{the weight}} of the vehicle to {{compress}} the surface being rolled (static) or use mechanical advantage (vibrating). Initial compaction of the substrate on a road project is done using a padfoot <b>drum</b> <b>roller,</b> which achieves higher compaction density due to the pads having less surface area. On large freeways a four wheel compactor with padfoot drum and a blade, such as a Caterpillar 815/825 series machine, would be used due to its high weight, speed and the powerful pushing force to spread bulk material. On regional roads a smaller single padfoot drum machine may be used. The next machine is usually a single smooth drum compactor that compacts the high spots down until the soil is smooth, and this is usually done in combination with a motor grader to get a level surface. Sometimes at this stage a pneumatic tyre roller would be used. These rollers feature two rows (front and back) of pneumatic tyres that overlap, and the flexibility of the tyres provides a kneading action that seals the surface and with some vertical movement of the wheels, enables the roller to operate effectively on uneven ground. Once the soil base is flat the pad drum compactor is no longer used on the road surface. The next course (road base) would be compacted using a smooth single drum, smooth tandem roller or pneumatic tyre roller in combination with a grader, and a water truck to achieve the desired flat surface with the right moisture content for optimum compaction. Once the road base is compacted, the smooth single drum compactor is no longer used on the road surface (There is however an exception, if the single drum has special flat-wide-base tyres on the machine). The final wear course of asphalt concrete (a.k.a. asphalt or blacktop in North America, or macadam in England) is laid using a paver and compacted using a tandem smooth <b>drum</b> <b>roller,</b> a three-point roller or a pneumatic tyre roller. Three point rollers on asphalt were very common once and are still used, but tandem vibrating rollers are the usual choice now, with the pneumatic tyre roller's kneading action being the last roller to seal off the surface.|$|E
40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} Cullman, Alabama to evaluate the effects of three different rollers/crimpers on terminating a rye (Secale cereale L) cover crop, soil moisture, and sweet corn yield in a no-till system. Three roller types were tested: a straight bar roller, a smooth roller with crimper, and a two-stage roller at speeds of 2 and 4 MPH. Termination rates provided by the three rollers/crimpers were compared to a smooth <b>drum</b> <b>roller</b> (no crimping bar) plus glyphosate (Roundup TM WeatherMax) * * applied at 1 lb/acre. Initialdata indicates that three weeks after rolling 100 % termination was attained by the smooth roller and glyphosate. A termination of 68 % was attained following the smooth roller with crimper at 4 MPH; however, {{no significant differences were}} found between the straight bar roller at both speeds, the smooth roller with crimper and the two-stage roller at 4 MPH (67 %). Roller type did not affect soil moisture after the first and second week from rolling. No significant difference in sweet corn yield was found between straight bar roller at 4 MPH, two-stage roller at 2 MPH, and smooth roller plus glyphosate. The lowest yield was found with smooth <b>drum</b> <b>roller</b> plus glyphosate. The highest yield (15, 348 lbs/ac or 6. 85 tonnes/ac) was recorded following the smooth roller with crimper at 4 MPH...|$|E

40|$|A {{field study}} {{comprised}} of experimental testing and statistical analyses {{was conducted to}} evaluate the Caterpillar machine drive power (MDP) and Geodynamik compaction meter value (CMV) compaction monitoring technologies applied to Caterpillar rollers. The study was comprised of three projects, all of which wee conducted at the Caterpillar Edwards Demonstration facility near Peoria, IL. The first project investigated the feasibility of using MDP applied to a Caterpillar self-propelled non-vibratory 825 G roller. A test strip was constructed, compacted using the prototype 825 G roller, and tested with in situ test devices. The second project also consisted of experimental testing on one-dimensional test strips. This project, however, used five cohesionless base materials, which were compacted using a CS- 533 E vibratory smooth <b>drum</b> <b>roller</b> with both MDP and CMV measurement capabilities. The independent roller measurements were compared and {{described in terms of}} soil engineering properties. The final project was conducted with only one cohesionless material. Four test strips (three uniform strips at different moisture contents and one with variable lift thickness) were constructed and tested to develop relationships between roller measurements and soil engineering properties. Using the material of the test strips, two-dimensional test areas with variable lift thickness and moisture content were then tested. Spatial analyses of the in situ measurements were performed to identify the spatial distribution of soil properties. The interpretation of the ground condition was then compared to machine output for evaluating the roller measurement systems and the proposed roller calibration procedure...|$|E
40|$|Pervious {{concrete}} is {{a relatively}} new material, standards and rigorous specifications for construction and placement are therefore still missing. One the one hand, the main characteristic to achieve is a high permeability to allow meteoric water percolate in the pavement and evaporate from the subgrade. On the other hand, developing pavement cementitious mixtures able to retain high void contents and reach significant mechanical performance entails an in-depth analysis of materials and construction practices. Pervious concrete can indeed be placed using a standard paver as for asphalt mixtures but the compaction stage is usually demanded to the contractor practices: light steel hand-rollers or standard drum rollers are both used without an in-depth knowledge of compaction properties of the cementitious mixture. The present paper aims at investigating the influence of compaction methods on the mechanical performance and void contents of pervious concrete mixtures. Several compaction procedures were tested modifying the compaction energy and the mixture characteristics while preserving high permeability. The main objective was to simulate and identify the effect of commonly adopted in situ compaction techniques - i. e. : tamper compaction as provided by the paver, steel hand-roller compaction, or standard <b>drum</b> <b>roller</b> compaction. Results showed how the compaction energy, water/cement ratios, and the percentage of cement affect the Indirect Tensile Strength and void contents of the mixtures. Further investigations were also conducted in order to comprehensively evaluate how the variation in the percentage of cement and water/cement ratio influenced the stiffness of the material. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland...|$|E
40|$|In {{the game}} of cricket, where a ball is bounced on a natural clay soil pitch between the ‘bowler’ and ‘batsman’, the ball-surface {{interaction}} is critical {{and is one of}} the most important factors responsible for the quality of play. Rolling of the playing surface with a smooth-wheel roller is common practice and this is intended to encourage pace, but with a predictable ball bounce that will provide a fair and safe playing surface. Current rolling management is largely based on anecdotal evidence and little work has previously being carried out in the UK to quantify the effects of rolling on cricket soils or to determine optimum rolling practice. Initiatives by the England and Wales Cricket Board (the project sponsors) to advance the commercial viability of {{the game of}} cricket and to increase player participation provide commercial justification for this project. This thesis aims to improve the fundamental understanding of the scientific principles of pitch preparation and to develop practical guidelines on roller use to help cricket groundsmen produce playing surfaces with the desired playability characteristics. A diverse methodology was used to meet the project objectives. A survey of current practice was conducted to inform experimental design and inform the targeting of rolling guidelines. Dynamic and static triaxial experiments were combined with standard laboratory tests to establish soil mechanical parameters for cricket soils. Field experimental plots and a project designed rolling simulator were used to investigate the interaction between soil mechanical and roller physical properties and to establish rolling management protocols. A grass rooting experiment was also conducted to determine the effect of soil density on root growth and distribution within the compacted soil profile. The survey of current practice established a wide range in rolling practice, particularly in the time allocated to rolling in the spring and for summer pre-match rolling. The experimental results developed the relationship between moisture and soil mechanical properties of cricket soils indicating an increase in plastic and elastic strain with an increase in moisture in un-saturated soils. An increase in soil moisture from 16 % to 25 % gravimetric moisture content was also shown to increase horizontal movement under a towed roller; however the inclusion of grass roots into the soil profile considerably reduced soil displacement. Soil optimum moisture conditions were identified for a range of roller specifications; 24 % gravimetric moisture for a 750 kg m - 3 roller and 22 % for a 920 kg m - 3 roller. Roller speed (0. 7 km h - 1) and the amount of roller passes required (four passes of a two <b>drum</b> <b>roller</b> in the spring and a total of 10 passes for summer match preparation) were established for cricket pitch preparation. Results also indicated a significant potential to reduce annual rolling times when undertaken in optimum soil moisture conditions. This could result in a substantial reduction in cost to the cricket industry and a reduction in CO 2 emissions. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

He devised a time lapse camera that stood twelve feet, built out of spare parts from a nearby junkyard, with a temperature controlled incubator.|$|R
40|$|Asphalt {{pavements}} {{have been}} compacted using steel <b>drum</b> <b>rollers</b> for a century. However, {{the problems that}} are observed today on these pavements are universal with no solution in sight. Intensive research work has been invested to identify the mechanisms that cause these problems. A recent development was the introduction of SuperPave mix design, GP asphalt cements, {{and the use of}} reinforcing elements ranging from polymer to steel bars. Yet it seems that none of these solutions have succeeded in eliminating any of the old problems. The pavements suffer from serious distresses regardless of the geographic location of the pavements and its design, materials, traffic loads, and climate condition. This paper presents a new approach to deal with the problems facing the asphalt pavements. While the research efforts to date concentrated on materials-related solutions, this paper identifies conventional compaction equipment as the cause of many problems observed on the pavements. The paper provides the development of the new Asphalt Multi-Integrated Roller, AMIR, and discusses new developments leading to a number of commercial field trials on several Ontario highways. The paper concludes that current compactors must be replaced with soft flat plates in order to achieve the required specifications for long term performance...|$|R
