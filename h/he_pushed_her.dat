500|$|... "Borderline" [...] was {{recorded}} in February 1983 and ushered a change from Madonna's [...] normal vocal tone. A sentimental track, the song talks about a love that is never quite fulfilled. According to author Santiago Fouz-Hernández in his book Madonna's drowned worlds, the song's lyrics like [...] "Something in way you love me won't let me be/I don't want to be your prisoner so baby won't you set me free" [...] depicted a rebellion against male chauvinism. Madonna used a refined and expressive voice to sing the song, backed by Lucas's instrumentations. It is considered {{the best example of}} the working relationship between Lucas and Madonna, and <b>he</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>her</b> to find emotional depth in the song. Although sounding icy, the chorus is contemporary in style, and the vocal range for this song was later used by Madonna as her own personal range through her whole music career. It opens with a keyboard rich intro played on a Fender-Rhodes electric piano and a catchy synth melody provided by Fred Zarr. Bass player Anthony Jackson doubled Dean Gant's synth bass to provide a solid and more complex texture.|$|E
