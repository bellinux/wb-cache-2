30|$|Mature {{sugar pine}} cones, with flame lengths > 1 m and flame {{duration}} of 3 min to 6 min, clearly {{have the potential}} to contribute to surface fire behavior and spread (Fonda and Varner 2004). Under some circumstances, flaming mature cones might also ignite shrubs and tree saplings. Burning cones also contribute to fire spread when they roll downhill beyond the fire perimeter, {{part of the reason for}} the practice of cup-trenching fire lines on steep terrain. Cones that smolder for long periods, such as the approximately 35 min smoldering times observed here for classes I through III, become potential ignition sources in the litter and duff layers with negative consequences for large tree survival (Hood 2010). Our laboratory measurements did not examine differences in burning characteristics due to different moisture contents or due to admixtures of cones and needles (sensu Taylor and Fonda 1990, Fonda and Varner 2004). A combination of laboratory and field experiments would provide insights into the role of sugar pine cones as a flame and <b>heat</b> <b>vector</b> for surface and ladder fuel ignition, or as a vector for duff ignition.|$|E
40|$|Classical {{continuum}} {{theories are}} useful {{in the study of}} a variety of problems of engineering and applied sciences. However, the emergence of new materials has provided the need for refined theories that account for certain features that are not accounted for in the classical continuum theories. Polar decomposition of the deformation gradient tensor into pure stretch and pure rotation tensors shows that the rotation tensor will in general vary from point to point. Similarly, polar decomposition of the velocity gradient tensor shows that the rate of rotation tensor will vary from point to point. It can also be shown that the strain and strain rate tensors used in classical theories of continuum mechanics do not depend on the rotation tensor or its gradients and therefore neglect the effect of changing rotations and rates of rotations between neighboring material points in Lagrangian description, and between neighboring locations in Eulerian description. Varying rotations and rates of rotations between neighboring material points will, if resisted by the continua, result in internal moments which are conjugate to these rotations and rates of rotations. These internal moments along with the conjugate rotations and rates of rotations will result in energy storage and dissipation, in addition to the energy storage and dissipation resulting from stress and its conjugate strain and strain rate. Based on this observation, it is necessary to modify the existing conservation and balance laws to include internal moments, which results in a more complete thermodynamic framework for solid and fluent continua. In this work, new conservation and balance laws are derived for solid and fluent continua that include internal moments which result from varying rotations and rotation rates. Also, constitutive theories are derived for the stress tensor, moment tensor, and <b>heat</b> <b>vector,</b> resulting in a complete mathematical model internal polar thermoelastic solids and internal polar thermoviscous fluids. This derivation does not rely on the introduction of external micro-rotations or stress couples as is done in the so called micro-polar or couple-stress theories. The theories presented here are therefore referred to as ?internal polar continuum theories?, as they are derived using only internal measures of deformation and do not require introduction of external degrees of freedom. We also present a framework for obtaining approximate solutions to the mathematical models resulting from the new continuum theories. Numeric results are presented to show the affect of the internal polar theories presented here...|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} simple, {{efficient}} and general statistical mechanical technique for calculating the pressure tensor and the <b>heat</b> flux <b>vector</b> in atomic fluids. The method {{is applied to}} the case of planar Poiseuille flow through a narrow slit pore and the results indicate that our technique is accurate and relatively efficient. A second method to calculate shear stress is derived from the momentum continuity equation. This mesoscopic method again is seen to be accurate with good computational efficiency. We also find that the commonly used approximation to the Irving-Kirkwood expression for the heat flux and the pressure tensor (where the Irving-Kirkwood Oij operator is set equal to unity-the so-called IK 1 approximation), leads to incorrect results for highly inhomogeneous fluids. In such cases the pressure tensor and <b>heat</b> flux <b>vector</b> display spurious oscillations. We calculate the spatially dependent viscosity across a narrow pore and find that it exhibits real but weak oscillations, a consequence of oscillations in the number density. Finally we point out that if the <b>heat</b> flux <b>vector</b> is coupled to the gradient of the square of the strain rate tensor such an effect will only affect the shape of the temperature profile. For planar Poiseuille flow, the temperature profile should deviate from the classical quartic form and include an additional quadratic component.

40|$|The linear thermoelastic {{behavior}} of a composite material reinforced by two independent and inextensible fiber families has been analyzed theoretically. The composite material {{is assumed to be}} anisotropic, compressible, dependent on temperature gradient, and showing linear elastic behavior. Basic principles and axioms of modern continuum mechanics and equations belonging to kinematics and deformation geometries of fibers have provided guidance and have been determining in the process of this study. The matrix material is supposed to be made of elastic material involving an artificial anisotropy due to fibers reinforcing by arbitrary distributions.

Our derivation is validated against nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of a confined fluid acted upon by a two-body Barker-Fisher-Watts force coupled with the Axilrod-Teller three-body force.

30|$|It is {{convenient}} {{to take into}} account that the heat flux and temperature gradient shown in Equation 1 are the local responses within the medium. They must not be confused with the global quantities specified in the boundary conditions. When a heat flux (as a laser source) is applied to the boundary of a solid medium, the temperature gradient established within the medium can still precede the heat flux. The application of the heat flux at the boundary does not guarantee the precedence of the <b>heat</b> flux <b>vector</b> to the temperature gradient at all. In fact, whether the <b>heat</b> flux <b>vector</b> precedes the temperature gradient or not depends on the combined effects of the thermal loading and thermal properties of the materials, as was explained by Tzou [3].

40|$|In this work, we {{introduce}} multipoint flux (MF) approximation {{method to}} the problem of conduction heat transfer in anisotropic media. In such media, the <b>heat</b> flux <b>vector</b> is no longer coincident with the temperature gradient vector. In this case, thermal conductivity is described as a second order tensor that usually requires, at least, six quantities to be fully defined in general three-dimensional problems. The two-point flux finite differences approximation may not handle such anisotropy and essentially more points need to be involved to describe the <b>heat</b> flux <b>vector.</b> In the framework of mixed finite element method (MFE), the MFMFE methods are locally conservative with continuous normal fluxes. We consider the lowest order Brezzi-Douglas-Marini (BDM) mixed finite element method with a special quadrature rule that allows for nodal velocity elimination resulting in a cell-centered system for the temperature. We show comparisons with some analytical solution of the problem of conduction heat transfer in anisotropic long strip. We also consider the problem of heat conduction in a bounded, rectangular domain with different anisotropy scenarios.
