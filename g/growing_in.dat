5|$|Within-crop diversity, a {{specific}} crop {{can result from}} various growing conditions, for example a crop <b>growing</b> <b>in</b> nutrient-poor soil {{is likely to have}} stunted growth than a crop <b>growing</b> <b>in</b> more fertile soil. The availability of water, soil pH level, and temperature similarly influence crop growth.|$|E

5|$|A ship of {{the line}} was a large, unarmored wooden sailing ship which mounted a battery of up to 120 smoothbore guns and carronades. The ship {{of the line}} {{developed}} gradually over centuries and, apart from <b>growing</b> <b>in</b> size, it changed little between the adoption of line of battle tactics in the early 17th century {{and the end of}} the sailing battleship's heyday in the 1830s. From 1794, the alternative term 'line of battle ship' was contracted (informally at first) to 'battle ship' or 'battleship'.|$|E

5|$|American Sign Language is <b>growing</b> <b>in</b> {{popularity}} among many states. Many people {{in high school}} and colleges wanting to take it as a foreign language, but until recently, it was not a creditable foreign language elective. The issue was that many didn't consider it a foreign language. ASL users, however, have a very distinct culture and way they interact when talking. Their facial expressions and hand movements reflect what they are conveying. They also have their own sentence structure which sets the language apart.|$|E
5|$|Apple scab: Apple scab causes {{leaves to}} develop olive-brown spots with a velvety texture that later turn brown and become cork-like in texture. The disease also affects the fruit, which also {{develops}} similar brown spots with velvety or cork-like textures. Apple scab is spread through fungus <b>growing</b> <b>in</b> old apple {{leaves on the}} ground and spreads during warm spring weather to infect the new year's growth.|$|E
5|$|As a {{saprobic}} mushroom, or decomposer {{of organic}} material, Ravenel's stinkhorn {{can be found}} in almost any habitat that includes decaying wood. They are most often found <b>growing</b> <b>in</b> groups, though occasionally singly, on wood chips, rotten tree stumps or sawdust. They are common in urban flowerbeds, parks and lawns, as well as in meadows, cultivated areas and woods. The foul odor of the gleba attracts insects that walk and feed on the spore-bearing surface, and later disseminate the sticky spores to other locales.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{versatility}} of {{the process}} and the simplicity of its equipment and operation, shielded metal arc welding is one of the world's first and most popular welding processes. It dominates other welding processes in the maintenance and repair industry, and though flux-cored arc welding is <b>growing</b> <b>in</b> popularity, SMAW continues to be used extensively in the construction of heavy steel structures and in industrial fabrication. The process is used primarily to weld iron and steels (including stainless steel) but aluminium, nickel and copper alloys can also be welded with this method.|$|E

5|$|Brazilian pepper (Schinus terebinthifolius) {{was brought}} to Southern Florida as an {{ornamental}} shrub and was dispersed by the droppings of birds and other animals that ate its bright red berries. It thrives on abandoned agricultural land <b>growing</b> <b>in</b> forests too dense for wading birds to nest in, similar to melaleucas. It grows rapidly especially after hurricanes and has invaded pineland forests. Following Hurricane Andrew, scientists and volunteers cleared damaged pinelands of Brazilian pepper so the native trees {{would be able to}} return to their natural state.|$|E
50|$|This {{plant can}} be found in eastern Colorado, eastern New Mexico, southwestern Kansas, southwestern Nebraska, western Texas, and {{possibly}} Oklahoma.
