Unaware of what each party is doing, London quickly reverses the hacks {{at the same time as}} the energy starts <b>flowing</b> <b>in</b> from other companies. This overloads the system, knocking out the entire Midwest power grid as the storm hits the city and London is killed in the process.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{magnetosphere}} {{is traditionally}} {{divided into three}} parts: the inner, middle and outer magnetosphere. The inner magnetosphere is located at distances closer than 10RJ from the planet. The magnetic field within it remains approximately dipole, because contributions from the currents <b>flowing</b> <b>in</b> the magnetospheric equatorial plasma sheet are small. In the middle (between 10 and 40RJ) and outer (further than 40RJ) magnetospheres, the magnetic field is not a dipole, and is seriously disturbed by its interaction with the plasma sheet (see magnetodisk below).|$|E

40|$|The most {{effective}} method {{to reduce the}} drag force of a sphere is to make dimples on its surface. In this paper, to investigate the <b>flow</b> <b>in</b> the dimple, the <b>flow</b> <b>in</b> a groove on a cylinder surface wasvisualized instead of the <b>flow</b> <b>in</b> a dimple of sphere. And the effective dimensions of the groove for reduction of drag force was verified. Moreover, since it can be considered that the <b>flow</b> <b>in</b> a dimple {{is similar to the}} <b>flow</b> <b>in</b> a groove, a statistical method to diagnose the optimum arrangement of dimples was investigated by applying the result of the groove flow...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} Bäcklund transformations of {{integrable}} geometric curve <b>flows</b> <b>in</b> certain geometries.

Some special solutions of the integrable systems are used to obtain the explicit Bäcklund transformations...|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to mining, the crown and central authorities also raised revenues by collecting produce from arable lands, timber from forests, and taxes on {{imports and exports}} at harbors. The king was capable of exploiting the mines, groves, agricultural lands, and forests belonging to the Macedonian state, although these were often leased as assets or given as grants {{to members of the}} nobility such as the hetairoi and philoi. Tariffs exacted on goods <b>flowing</b> <b>in</b> and out of Macedonian seaports began since at least the reign of Amyntas III of Macedon, while the Oikonomika by Pseudo-Aristotle explains how Callistratus of Aphidnae (d. c. 350 BC) aided Perdiccas III in doubling the kingdom's annual profits on customs duties from 20 to 40 talents.|$|E
5|$|Primary and {{secondary}} education improved as well, though the extreme growth in the new boomtowns initially caused severe strain on school systems unprepared for the rapid influx of students. Even as money was rapidly <b>flowing</b> <b>in</b> the communities, obtaining tax revenue efficiently where it was needed was often complex. Communities dealt with these problems by establishing independent school districts, education districts formed independently of city or county government with their own independent taxing authority. This type of school district is still the standard in Texas today.|$|E

5|$|The Puget Sound Convergence Zone is an {{important}} feature of Seattle's weather. In the convergence zone, air arriving from the north meets air <b>flowing</b> <b>in</b> from the south. Both streams of air originate over the Pacific Ocean; airflow is split by the Olympic Mountains to Seattle's west, then reunited to the east. When the air currents meet, they are forced upward, resulting in convection. Thunderstorms caused by this activity are usually weak and can occur {{north and south of}} town, but Seattle itself rarely receives more than occasional thunder and small hail showers. The Hanukkah Eve Wind Storm in December 2006 is an exception that brought heavy rain and winds gusting up to , an event that was not caused by the Puget Sound Convergence Zone and was widespread across the Pacific Northwest.|$|E
5|$|During {{and after}} the Revolutionary War, Albany County saw a great {{increase}} in real estate transactions. After Horatio Gates' win over John Burgoyne at Saratoga in 1777, the upper Hudson Valley was generally at peace as the war raged on elsewhere. Prosperity was soon seen all over Upstate New York. Migrants from Vermont and Connecticut began <b>flowing</b> <b>in,</b> noting the advantages of living on the Hudson and trading at Albany, while being only a few days' sail from New York City. Albany reported a population of 3,498 in the first national census in 1790, an increase of almost 700% since its chartering. In 1797, the state capital of New York was moved permanently to Albany. From statehood to this date, the Legislature had frequently moved the state capital between Albany, Kingston, Hurley, Poughkeepsie, {{and the city of}} New York. Albany is the tenth-oldest state capital in the United States, but only the second-oldest state capital that is a city, after Santa Fe, New Mexico.|$|E
5|$|New York City {{played a}} complex {{role in the}} American Civil War. The city's strong {{commercial}} ties to the southern United States existed for many reasons, including the industrial power of the Hudson River harbor, which allowed trade with stops such as the West Point Foundry, {{one of the great}} manufacturing operations in the early United States; and the city's Atlantic Ocean ports, rendering New York City the American powerhouse in terms of industrial trade between the northern and southern United States. New York's growing immigrant population, which had originated largely from Germany and Ireland, began in the late 1850s to include waves of Italians and Central and Eastern European Jews <b>flowing</b> <b>in</b> en masse. Anger arose about conscription, with resentment at those who could afford to pay $300 to avoid service leading to resentment against Lincoln's war policies and fomenting paranoia about free Blacks taking the poor immigrants' jobs, culminating in the three-day-long New York Draft Riots of July 1863. These intense war-time riots are counted among the worst incidents of civil disorder in American history, with an estimated 119 participants and passersby massacred.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of the collateral circulation after ligation of the innominate and right common carotid arteries for subclavian aneurysm was studied in two cases by measuring the rate of blood <b>flow</b> <b>in</b> the hand's from time to time. In a woman, sixty-eight years old, the <b>flow</b> <b>in</b> the right hand {{three weeks after the}} operation was two-sevenths of that in the left. Nineteen weeks after the operation the <b>flow</b> <b>in</b> the right hand was more than three-fourths of that in the left, although no pulse returned until long afterwards. In a man, twenty-five years old, the <b>flow</b> <b>in</b> the right hand eleven days after the operation was between one-fourth and one-fifth of that in the left. Seventeen days after the operation the <b>flow</b> <b>in</b> the right hand was nearly one-third of the <b>flow</b> <b>in</b> the left. Twenty-four days after the operation the <b>flow</b> <b>in</b> the right hand had increased to more than one-half of the left hand flow. Thirty-one days after the operation the <b>flow</b> <b>in</b> the right hand was three-fifths of that in the left, without return, as yet, of any pulsation. Before the operation the <b>flow</b> <b>in</b> the right hand was markedly greater than in the left, notwithstanding the small size of the right radial pulse as compared with the left.

5|$|The main ovals are the {{dominant}} {{part of the}} Jovian aurorae. They have stable shapes and locations, but their intensities are strongly modulated by the solar wind pressure—the stronger solar wind, the weaker the aurorae. As mentioned above, the main ovals are maintained by the strong influx of electrons accelerated by the electric potential drops between the magnetodisk plasma and the Jovian ionosphere. These electrons carry field aligned currents, which maintain the plasma's co-rotation in the magnetodisk. The potential drops develop because the sparse plasma outside the equatorial sheet can only carry a current of a limited strength without those currents. The precipitating electrons have energy in the range 10–100keV and penetrate deep into the atmosphere of Jupiter, where they ionize and excite molecular hydrogen causing ultraviolet emission. The total energy input into the ionosphere is 10–100TW. In addition, the currents <b>flowing</b> <b>in</b> the ionosphere heats it by the process known as Joule heating. This heating, which produces up to 300TW of power, {{is responsible for the}} strong infrared radiation from the Jovian aurorae and partially for the heating of the thermosphere of Jupiter.|$|E

25|$|The {{equations}} used {{in physics}} to model reality do not treat {{time in the}} same way that humans commonly perceive it. The equations of classical mechanics are symmetric with respect to time, and equations of quantum mechanics are typically symmetric if both time and other quantities (such as charge and parity) are reversed. In these models, the perception of time <b>flowing</b> <b>in</b> one direction is an artifact of the laws of thermodynamics (we perceive time as <b>flowing</b> <b>in</b> the direction of increasing entropy).|$|E
