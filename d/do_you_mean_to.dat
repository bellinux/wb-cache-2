2500|$|The second specimen, {{found in}} 1952 by Comoran {{fisherman}} Ahamadi Abdallah, {{was described as}} a different species, first as Malania hunti and later as Malania anjounae, after Daniel François Malan, the South African Prime Minister who had dispatched an SAAF Dakota at the behest of Professor Smith to fetch the specimen. It was later discovered that the lack of a first dorsal fin, at first thought to be significant, was caused by an injury early in the specimen's life. Ironically, Malan was a staunch creationist; when he was first shown the primitive creature, he exclaimed, with a twinkle, [...] "My, it is ugly. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> say we once looked like that?" [...] The specimen retrieved by Smith is on display at the SAIAB in Grahamstown, South Africa where he worked.|$|E

6000|$|... "I shall {{miss you}} dreadfully, boys; but I {{will not say}} a word to keep you here, for I am sure it is very, very bad for you. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> do? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> go to sea?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, squire, speak {{your mind}} faithfully. There was some talk once of Frank's marrying Miss Dunstable; <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> {{object to that}} match?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I shall," [...] Crawshay told him. [...] "I want to {{hear how}} you got on. I {{gathered}} from your first telegram that {{you were on the}} track. Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> stay?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And pray, Rupert,' said Elizabeth, 'what <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> by {{comparing}} me <b>to</b> Edie Ochiltree? <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> say that <b>you</b> were like Monkbarns? I {{never heard that}} that gentleman fabricated either legends or curiosities, and made them pass for genuine ancient ones.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "WHAT!" [...] screamed out Mrs. Score. [...] "Are not you the Count? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> {{say that}} you a'n't Cat's--? <b>DO</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> {{say that you}} didn't order her bed, and that you won't pay this here little bill?" [...] And with this she {{produced}} a document, by which the Count's lady was made her debtor in a sum of half-a-guinea.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well now, Gertrude, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> say {{you think}} it right that Katie should sit by and hear a man talk as Captain Cuttwater talked last night? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> say that the scene which passed, with the rum and the curses, and the absurd ridicule which was thrown on your mother's uncle, was such as should take place in your mother's drawing-room?' ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> it <b>to</b> be made of?' Alice asked, {{hoping to}} cheer him up, {{for the poor}} Knight seemed quite low-spirited about it.|$|R
6000|$|KING. [...] "'What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean?</b> [turning <b>to</b> Podewils]--QU'EST-CE QUE NOUS MANQUE DE TOUTE LA GUELDRE (How much of Guelderland is theirs, and {{not ours}} already)?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Then how was it, sir? Is it thus {{that you}} treat other women--your friends, {{those to whom}} you declare friendship? What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> me <b>to</b> think?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No; he didn't {{say very}} much about it at all. He said of course you were within your rights. But <b>do</b> <b>you</b> really <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it, Bryan?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean?</b> But <b>to</b> tell <b>you</b> the truth, Harcourt, I have {{no great}} {{inclination}} {{to discuss that}} matter just at present. If you please, we will leave Miss Waddington alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'People has tongues!' {{repeated}} Adeline, {{when that}} excellent person had disappeared. 'Yes, indeed, they have. But, Jenny, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> really <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> say that <b>you</b> {{know all about}} this?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{there was}} a great {{rustling}} in the undergrowth, and out ran a wild boar, grunting, 'Umph, umph, umph; someone said dinner was ready. Was it <b>you?</b> and <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> me <b>to</b> come?' ...|$|R
