5|$|The {{first time}} he cheated on me, I thought there was {{something}} wrong with me or the relationship, but when someone makes a habit of it, you know the problem lies with him. Yet I was foolish enough to give him a second chance because he begged and pleaded, despite the fact that everyone around me said he was still straying. I guess I really wanted to believe in him. Then I actually caught him red-handed. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> to get out. But having done that, nothing can make me go back.|$|E

[...] The Fame is not about who you are—it's about how {{everybody}} wants to know who you are! Buy it and listen to it before you go out or in the car. [...] I think you've really got to allow artists' creativity to marinate. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> but really delving into myself I finally got it. I couldn't be more proud of it. It's not just a record it's a whole pop art movement It's not just about one song." ...|$|E

And so I woke up one night and I got it, and I said, 'I got it: We have to birth a new race.' From the gate, Gaga was like, 'I want Nick Knight for this video. I want a visual.' She was always birthing something visual in her head, and Nick Knight is just, well, he's prolific but he's so genius. It was about pushing the bar of what a music video should be and can be. [...] It's a different time; it's a different era; there are no limits. It is a viral message. I think that there's something in there for everyone, and that's what's so amazing about the video and so specific about the message." ...|$|E

2500|$|Before joining Green Day, Tré Cool {{employed}} a more intricate drumming style. [...] He explained that [...] "When I started, I {{had too many}} drums. I was a little reggae-happy and into fancier beats than was needed. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> to get it: play the song, don't play the instrument. I started {{figuring out how to}} make the band a stronger unit, to make it jump." [...] After playing with Green Day bassist Mike Dirnt, Tré Cool adopted a more rhythmic style with fewer drum fills to match Dirnt's bass lines.|$|E

Ricketts received her Bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago in 1994, and her Juris Doctor from the University of Michigan Law School in 1998. Laura talks of her own struggle to come out; [...] "I came out to my family I would say early to mid 90s. I think {{for a long time}} I wasn't really out to myself, growing up in Omaha, Neb., to a Catholic conservative family. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> to come out to myself and not long after that I came out to them.

Gutman became the first employee of Video Game Player (later Computer Games) in 1982. He said, [...] "I started {{a magazine}} about video games and suddenly I was an expert in video games. I started writing about them and computers.

5000|$|My {{father and}} I never really {{achieved}} a real relationship. We probably {{saw each other}} 20 or 25 times in our lifetime. When you are able, at my age, to count the times you have seen your father, it says something...

5000|$|When {{asked of}} her {{portrayal}} of the character, Minshew cited Kendall's complexity. [...] "She is a hard character to play.

5000|$|The album's {{departure}} from the darker lyrics of Headless Cross was discussed by Tony Iommi in his 2012 autobiography Iron Man: [...] "For our next album, Tyr, {{we went back to}} the Woodcray Studios in February 1990, with me and Cozy producing it again. On Headless Cross, Tony Martin had just come into the band and he assumed, oh, Black Sabbath, it's all about the Devil, so his lyrics were full of the Devil and Satan. It was too much in your face. We told him to be a bit more subtle about it, so for Tyr he did all these lyrics about Nordic gods and whatnot. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> to get my head around that." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "For years I {{had been}} a member of a group called the European American Issues Forum. The {{president}} of the organization resigned for health reasons, and I ended up filling his shoes. The EAIF was a great idea—a genuine, non-racist civil rights group for Americans of European descent—but in practice it was unworkable. The basic premise was simple: the social and political system could be made to respond to the needs of European-Americans just as it had responded to the demands of other racial groups. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> to realize that no amount of letter writing or protesting was going to win any concessions from our opponents until there was a massive change in consciousness."

6000|$|... "I'm right {{sorry to}} be so late, Sir Charles," [...] he cried. [...] "I'd have been sooner, but <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> little time {{to make it all}} {{straight}} with the missus.

5000|$|By {{the time}} she was in her late thirties, Bobbie Ann started to write short stories. In 1980 The New Yorker {{published}} her first story. [...] "It <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> long time to discover my material", she said. [...] "It wasn't a matter of developing writing skills, {{it was a matter of}} knowing how to see things. And <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> very long time to grow up. I'd been writing for a long time, but was never able to see what there was to write about. I always aspired to things away from home, so <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> long time to look back at home and realize that that's where the center of my thought was."

5000|$|Davis was {{required}} to wear self-adhesive eye patches for her role, which not only {{proved to be a}} constant irritant, but affected her equilibrium as well. Sheila Hancock knew Davis had wanted Jill Bennett to replace her, but Bennett wasn't available. The concept of the Hollywood star system was foreign to Hancock, a veteran of the English Stage Company at the Royal Court Theatre, and she resented the fawning attention paid to Davis based on her past successes. When everyone on the lot arrived to watch the star film her first scene, Hancock was [...] "dumbfounded [...] [...] [...] <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> to realize this was the way Bette Davis was used to operating.

5000|$|Simpson {{said when}} announcing the release: [...] "The making of this album {{has been an}} {{incredible}} journey for me, it is probably the hardest record I have ever had to make. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> to find what I was looking for and there were points when I nearly {{had to go back}} to the drawing board. However, after taking some much needed time out from writing and all things music related, I came back with a completely fresh perspective and wrote in my opinion, some of the best music I have written in my career so far. It’s an album I am hugely proud of and one I had to fight for which makes it all the more special".|$|E
5000|$|Speaking {{about her}} injury-plagued 2012 season, Williams stated, [...] "I just {{had so much}} going on and my body just started to break down. If someone had asked me before what my worst setback was, I would have said coming second at the world juniors, but this was a proper setback. That was my first real setback year. It was hard, as I'd not been used to dealing with {{setbacks}} before." [...] She added, [...] "It was tough to sit back and watch it, to see other people competing, and thinking I could have been there at the home Olympics, but then I told myself I'm 18 and there's hopefully plenty more Olympics ahead of me.
