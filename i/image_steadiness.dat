50|$|Foma R-100 film also {{continues}} to be produced by the European manufacturer Foma. Due to aging punch dies, this film does NOT have an advantage over Super 8 film in terms of <b>image</b> <b>steadiness,</b> unfortunately.|$|E
50|$|Although few {{models were}} introduced, Nikon made movie cameras as well. The R10 and R8 SUPER ZOOM Super 8 models (introduced in 1973) were {{the top of}} the line and last attempt for the amateur movie field. The cameras had a special gate and claw system to improve <b>image</b> <b>steadiness</b> and {{overcome}} a major drawback of Super 8 cartridge design. The R10 model has a high speed 10X macro zoom lens.|$|E
5000|$|A lightweight, highly-mobile camera {{transportation}} and stabilization device developed by inventor / cinematographer Garrett Brown which permits hand-held filming with an <b>image</b> <b>steadiness</b> comparable to tracking or dolly shots. The device involves 1.) a vest redistributing {{the weight of}} the camera to the hips of the cameraman and, 2.) a spring-loaded arm working to minimize the effects of camera movement. A video tap simultaneously frees the camera operator from the eyepiece, who is then free to travel through any walkable terrain while filming.|$|E
5000|$|All 16 mm {{perforations}} are rectangles with {{rounded corners}} and are 0.0500" [...] (1.27mm) high by 0.078" [...] (1.9812mm) wide. The tolerance for these perforation dimensions {{was reduced to}} 0.01 mm in 1989, which allowed 16 mm camera manufacturers to slightly enlarge their registration pins and thus improve <b>image</b> registration and <b>steadiness</b> tolerances to less than 1/750th of the image height of the 16 mm frame.|$|R
40|$|Due to its {{mechanical}} nature {{motion picture}} film has {{to cope with}} inaccuracies in positioning the single image {{in the moment of}} exposure, projection and scanning. This is the reason for steadiness errors that manifest in a jitter of the whole image. This jitter is not limited to translations but may also include rotational and shearing motion components. The amplitude of these erroneous movements lies in the scope of modern film scanner resolution and thus is a problem of scanning motion picture film especially in real time. The proposed algorithm estimates motion parameters for every <b>image</b> including the <b>steadiness</b> error component. Based on the sequence of these motion parameters a correction signal can be calculated to suppress the subjective jitter of the motion picture. Introduction The mechanical nature of motion picture film induces a typical property of this medium, the steadiness error. In the moment of exposure, projection or scanning every single image has to be positioned. T [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, {{special effects}} work at ILM quickly {{stretched}} {{the company to}} its operational limits. While the R&D work and experience gained from the previous two films in the trilogy allowed for increased efficiency, this was offset {{by the desire to}} have the closing film raise the bar set by each of these films. A compounding factor was the intention of several departments of ILM to either take on other film work or decrease staff during slow cycles. Instead, as soon as production began, the entire company found it necessary to remain running 20 hours a day on six-day weeks in order to meet their goals by April 1, 1983. Of about 900 special effects shots, all VistaVision optical effects remained in-house, since ILM was the only company capable of using the format, while about 400 4-perf opticals were subcontracted to outside effects houses. Progress on the opticals was severely delayed for a time when ILM rejected about 100000 ft of film when the film perforations failed <b>image</b> registration and <b>steadiness</b> tests.|$|R
