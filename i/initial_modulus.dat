40|$|Load {{rating is}} the process to {{evaluate}} and explore the structural capacity of bridges {{as much as possible}} within safety range. As a balance between economy and safety, proper load ratings save money and keep public safe. Knowing the contribution and interaction of each different soil parameter on the loading can significantly reduce the amount of work when load rating those structures. However, for buried structures without plans, such contribution or interaction is never known. This parametric study explores how much each soil parameter of three types of soils can affect the loading of buried structures without plans. An existing computer software is employed to model the buried structures without plans and to simulate the theoretical structural responses using 2 D finite element analysis approach. The study shows different results for different soil types. In general, as <b>initial</b> tangent Young’s <b>modulus</b> and density increase, moments, thrusts, and shears increase. Plus, as power-law coefficient for <b>initial</b> tangent Young’s <b>modulus</b> and <b>initial</b> tangent bulk <b>modulus</b> increase, moments, thrusts, and shears always decrease for silty clay whereas they first increase and then decrease for gravelly sand and sandy silt. In conclusion, <b>initial</b> tangent Young’s <b>modulus,</b> power-law coefficient for <b>initial</b> tangent Young’s <b>modulus,</b> <b>initial</b> tangent bulk <b>modulus,</b> and density are the four most sensitive soil parameters with respect to their effects on loading of buried structures...|$|R

50|$|Kevlar, an aramid fiber, {{has become}} the {{predominant}} fiber for racing sails, since it was introduced by DuPont in 1971. It is stronger, has a higher strength to weight ratio than steel, and has a modulus that is five times greater than PET, and about {{twice as high as}} PEN. There are two popular types of Kevlar: Type 29 and Type 49, the latter having a 50% higher <b>initial</b> <b>modulus</b> than Type 29 but a lower flex loss. DuPont has developed higher modulus Types 129, 149 and 159, but these have seen little use in sails, since generally as the modulus increases the flex strength decreases. DuPont has recently introduced Kevlar Edge, a fiber developed specifically for sails with 25% higher flex strength and a higher modulus than Kevlar 49.Kevlar, along with other aramid fibers, have poor UV resistance (Kevlar loses strength roughly twice as quickly in sunlight as PET) and rapid loss of strength with flexing, folding and flogging. Minimal flogging and careful handling can greatly extend the life of a Kevlar sail.|$|E

Firstly, pseudo excitation method and Mazar damage model were used to analyze how to calculate damage expected value excited by random seismic loading and deterministic static load {{on the condition that}} <b>initial</b> elastic <b>modulus</b> was deterministic. Moreover, response surface method was improved from the aspects of the regression of sample points, the selection of experimental points, the determined method of weight matrix and the calculation method of checking point respectively.

Finally, a test example was given to verify and analyze the convergence and stability of this method. Compared with other conventional algorithm, this method has some strong points: this algorithm has good convergence and stability and greatly enhances calculation efficiency and the storage efficiency. From what has been analyzed, we find that damage expected value is insensitive to the randomness of <b>initial</b> elastic <b>modulus</b> so we can neglect the randomness of <b>initial</b> elastic <b>modulus</b> in some extent when we calculate damage expected value...|$|R

The 80 : 20 albumin-rubber formulation possessed the optimal mix of high <b>initial</b> <b>modulus</b> and tanδ as its tanδ values were comparable to the 70 : 30 and 75 : 25 albumin-rubber ratios. However, the 80 : 20 albumin-rubber bioplastics possessed a higher <b>initial</b> <b>modulus</b> while having a tanδ peak at a lower temperature than the bioplastics that contained lower weights of rubber (Figure  2 c). When we compared the plastics based on the types of plasticizer used, we found that the <b>initial</b> <b>modulus</b> was similar for all three plasticizers, but the natural rubber-based bioplastics exhibited the lowest initial tanδ values, whereas other plasticizers (water and glycerol) showed highest viscous heat dissipation (Pommet et al. 2005).

40|$|During sewing at high speed, {{the needle}} thread is {{subjected}} to repeated tensile stresses, heat, bending, pressure, torsion and wearing. These stresses act on the thread repeatedly and the thread passes 50 - 80 times through the fabric, the needle eye and the bobbin case mechanism, before getting incorporated into the seam. As a result both the sewing thread and the yarns in the fabric get abraded / severed during the seaming process. A number of researchers observed {{that there could be}} 30 % to 40 % strength loss in the cotton needle thread after sewing. The extent of damage becomes more critical if the fabric being used is of a dense, thick and heavy construction. A number of studies have been carried out on thread strength loss after sewing, but the impact of fabric characteristics on thread strength loss is still unexplored. In this paper, the effect of weight and fabric composition of workwear fabrics, on the changes in the tenacity, breaking elongation and <b>initial</b> <b>modulus</b> of the needle thread has been studied. The tenacity and breaking elongation loss increase with increase in fabric weight for staple threads and remain unchanged for core spun threads. The loss in <b>initial</b> <b>modulus</b> increases for polyester threads as fabric weight increases, and decreases for cotton thread. When sewn on polyester-cotton fabric of same weight, the cotton thread shows decrease in tenacity and breaking elongation loss, whereas loss in <b>initial</b> <b>modulus</b> increases.

With an increase in the particle size, the <b>initial</b> shear <b>modulus</b> 0 G gets lower, and the saturated magnetic-induced shear modulus G∆ increases to the maximum and then decreases. The larger the particle size is, the longer the distance between neighbor particles along the magnetic field is.

Moreover, the performance of MRE can be improved by optimizing the particle size based on those rules...|$|R

Techniques were {{developed}} to make in situ measurements of gelled resin to determine linear shrinkage, stress-strain response and stress relaxation of single strands of SL 5170 epoxy and SL 5149 photocurable resins. Epoxy strands shrank approximately 1. 4 % and the acrylate strands about 1. 0 % after a single exposure. No forces were measured during cure shrinkage of strands following the first laser exposure. In multiple laser exposures, the acrylate continues to shrink; whereas (University of Dayton data) no additional shrinkage is observed in epoxy strands on a second hit. In force relaxation tests, a strand is drawn and then a 0. 5 % step strain is applied after different elapsed times. The epoxy <b>initial</b> <b>modulus</b> evolves (increases) with elapsed time following draw of the strand, and this evolution in modulus occurs after linear shrinkage has stopped. On the other hand, acrylates show no evolution of modulus with elapsed time following a single laser draw; i. e., once shrinkage stops after one laser hit, the <b>initial</b> <b>modulus</b> remains stable with elapsed time. Finally, relaxation response times of epoxy strands get larger with increasing elapsed time after laser draw.
