5|$|Knowledge of the {{clitoris}} {{is significantly}} impacted by cultural {{perceptions of the}} organ. Studies suggest that knowledge of its existence and anatomy is scant in comparison with that of other sexual organs, and that more education about <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> alleviate social stigmas associated with the female body and female sexual pleasure; for example, that the clitoris and vulva in general are visually unappealing, that female masturbation is taboo, or that men {{should be expected to}} master and control women's orgasms.|$|E
5|$|Diffused {{lighting}} camouflage {{was a form}} {{of active}} camouflage using counter-illumination to enable a ship to match its background, the night sky, prototyped by the Royal Canadian Navy on corvettes during World War II. The principle was discovered by a Canadian professor, Edmund Godfrey Burr, in 1940. It attracted interest because <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> to hide ships from submarines in the ongoing Battle of the Atlantic, and the research project began early in 1941. The Royal Navy and the US Navy carried out further equipment development and trials between 1941 and 1943.|$|E

25|$|The Temple {{distinguished}} {{itself from}} most new religious movements with its overtly political message. It combined those genuine political sympathies with {{the perception that}} <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> turn out large numbers of votes to gain {{the support of a}} number of prominent politicians. Jones made it known after he moved to San Francisco that he was interested in politics, and legal changes strengthened political groups like the Temple.|$|E
25|$|According to Rimé, if {{the social}} sharing {{experience}} is a pleasant one, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> to strengthen socio-affective links between the two people. As seen in the diagram, social sharing can result in reciprocal affection between the two people involved, and can play an obvious role in attachment. When the social sharing is done between partners in an intimate relationship, it {{could be seen as}} a reinforcement of their affective bond.|$|E

25|$|As {{soon as it}} was {{announced}} that the wing would be kept alive and Otis Air National Guard Base would remain open, the state government began thinking of the future for the 101st. There was talk among the members of the Massachusetts National Guard that it could transition to an intelligence mission so that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> support the War on Terror. The plans hit a roadblock when it {{was announced}} that there were few funds left with which the wing could use to transition into its new mission.|$|E
25|$|Self-esteem was {{believed}} to be a cultural phenomenon of Western individualistic societies since low self-esteem was not occurring in collectivist countries such as Japan. The idea of low self-esteem and its many negative consequences led California assemblyman John Vasconcellos to work to create and fund the Task Force on Self-Esteem and Personal and Social Responsibility in California in 1986. Vasconcellos argued that this task force could combat many of the state's problems from crime and teen pregnancy to school underachievement and pollution. He compared increasing self-esteem to giving out a vaccine for a disease: <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> protect people from being overwhelmed by life's challenges.|$|E
25|$|Some Green Minibus Unions {{have called}} for the Government to provide a new fleet of buses which can hold up to 20 people, 4 more people than the current 16 people. They say <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> ease traffic {{congestion}} during rush hour and possible push up profits which may turn away possible fare increases. There {{are a few of}} the new buses in service at the moment, but because it is only legal to have 16 passengers in a minibus, the extra area is used as a luggage rack. The Government has responded saying that it would be prudent to first study the implications of such expansion in the context of a Public Transport Strategy Study first, which should take two years ending in 2017 or 2018.|$|E

25|$|Born {{and raised}} in Las Vegas, Nevada, Mir began {{training}} and competing in American Kenpo at a school owned by his parents, earning his black belt as a teenager. Mir's father was a Cuban-born wrestler of Russian and Moroccan heritage, who {{played a major role}} in convincing him to begin wrestling on the basis that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> him avoid submissions. Mir joined the wrestling team at Bonanza High School during his junior year and lost his first nine matches. During his senior year (1998) he went 44–1 and won the state championship. Mir played fullback and defensive end on the school's football team that reached the Southern Zone semifinals in 1997, and also competed in track and field. His discus throw of 177 feet, 10inches is still a Sunset Regional record.|$|E
25|$|There was {{reluctant}} {{support for the}} Convention back in the UK where Attlee's Labour government were in power. The Lord Chancellor Jowitt, the Colonial Secretary Griffiths and the Chancellor Sir Stafford Cripps disapproved of ratification {{on the basis of}} the loss of sovereignty that would result. Jowitt also saw a threat to the domestic system of common law and the risk in allowing judgments to be made by an unknown foreign court. He nevertheless believed that ratification was necessary from a political point of view as a refusal would be, in his view, difficult to justify at home and abroad. Political pressure aside, the overall government view was that the Convention was only aimed at preventing a totalitarian takeover and not human rights issues within a functioning democracy. In essence, it was thought that Britain had little to lose from ratification but rejection could risk some loss of face in Europe. The Convention had more support among Conservative party politicians, in particular Winston Churchill who believed that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> unify Europe {{on the basis of the}} rule of law.|$|E
500|$|In {{his book}} Video Games Around the World, author Mark J.P. Wolf called the game an [...] "impressive achievement" [...] {{considering}} the developers' young age. Internetstiftelsen i Sverige, the organization {{responsible for the}} Swedish top-level domain [...]se, described the game as [...] "legendary", and [...] "an iconic name within the gaming community". Kristiansson called the decision to create an adventure game in Swedish commendable, and thought <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> counteract the IBM PC's stigma as not being a computer for average people in Sweden. Sigrid Nurbo at Jönköpings-Posten noted the game's absence from the 2013 video game exhibit at the Swedish National Museum of Science and Technology as odd considering its popularity and cult status. An eight-week-long video game development camp, named [...] "Stugan" [...] after The Cottages Swedish title, has been held annually in Sweden since 2015.|$|E

As of 2013, however, the Worldwide Documentaries website stated that Bilheimer was considering different subjects for his next film, including poverty in the United States, the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, and posttraumatic stress disorder among U.S. Army veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Bilheimer said in 2013 that Not My Life [...] "is not a perfect film by any means, but it is having an impact." [...] He {{said that he}} would like to be moving on to a new film project, but that he would continue promoting Not My Life because he thought <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> combat human trafficking.|$|E

Leo Tolstoy deplored that a silence had fallen around George, for he viewed Georgism as reasonable and realistic, as opposed to other utopian movements, and as a [...] "contribution to the enlightenment of the consciousness of mankind, placed on a practical footing,” and that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> do away with {{what he called the}} Slavery of Our Times.” ...|$|E

The attorney representing the Bell family, Nicole Paultre, and the two other occupants of the vehicle who were wounded during the shooting denounced this development, saying, [...] "We expected them to throw dirt at us, and they are throwing dirt at us."

Such a coalition existing between Germany in the west and the Soviet Union in the east, might have been strong enough to deter both from military intervention. Beck realized that for the immediate future there was no realistic chance of building such a force. Therefore, he was prepared to settle in 1937–38 for a diplomatic bloc referred to as a [...] "Third Europe," [...] led by Poland, that might become the nucleus of a Międzymorze federation.
