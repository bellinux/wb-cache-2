5|$|Most {{people who}} stay at Glastonbury Festival camp in a tent. There are {{different}} camping areas, {{each with its}} own atmosphere. Limekilns and Hitchin Hill Ground are quieter camping areas, whereas Pennard Hill Ground is a lively campsite. Cockmill Meadow is a family campsite and Wicket Ground was introduced in 2011 as a second family-only campsite. A disabled campsite is also available in Spring Ground. Campsite accommodation is provided in the cost of a standard entry ticket but festival-goers must bring their own tents. Tipis have been at the festival for many years. A limited number of fixed tipis are available for hire at the tipi field near the stone circle. Up to six adults can stay in each tipi and each one comes with a <b>groundsheet</b> and raincatcher. Internal bedding and camping equipment is not provided. Tipi Park also offers solar showers and a log-fired yurt sauna to cap off the experience.|$|E

This included a personal weapon, such as the SMLE rifle or Sten Gun, ammunition, grenades, a machete or Gurkha kukri knife, seven days' rations, <b>groundsheet,</b> change of uniform and other assorted items. Much of this load was carried in an Everest carrier, which was essentially a metal rucksack frame without a pack.|$|E
5000|$|An {{optional}} tent footprint or <b>groundsheet</b> protector may be used. This is {{a separate}} flat <b>groundsheet</b> which goes underneath the main <b>groundsheet,</b> and is slightly smaller than that <b>groundsheet.</b> The intention {{is to protect the}} main <b>groundsheet,</b> especially when camping on rough terrain, since it is much cheaper to replace a separate footprint <b>groundsheet</b> than it is to replace a sewn-in <b>groundsheet.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A <b>groundsheet</b> is used {{to provide}} a {{waterproof}} barrier between the ground and a sleeping bag. With double skin tents, the inner tents normally have a sewn-in <b>groundsheet,</b> but a separate flat <b>groundsheet</b> may be provided for any living area. With single skin tents, the <b>groundsheet</b> may be sewn in or separate. Normal practice with sewn-in groundsheets is for the <b>groundsheet</b> to extend some 15 cm up {{the lower part of}} the walls (sometimes called a 'bathtub' arrangement); this copes with a situation where water seeps under the side walls of the tent. Separate groundsheets allow load-sharing when backpacking, and may make it easier to pitch and strike a tent, but they provide less protection against insects etc. getting into the sleeping area; also, if any part of a separate <b>groundsheet</b> protrudes from under the side walls, then it provides a ready path for moisture to flow into the tent.|$|E

50|$|Single-sided designs allow {{easy access}} {{and allow the}} heat of a fire into the shelters, while full roofed designs have much better heat retention. As a general rule the roof should be at least a foot thick and opaque to bright sunlight. Artificial bivouacs can be {{constructed}} using a variety of available materials from corrugated iron sheeting or plywood, to <b>groundsheets</b> or a purpose-made basha. Although these have the advantage of being speedy to erect and resource efficient they have relatively poor insulation properties.|$|R
50|$|A fly {{refers to}} the outer layer of a tent or {{to a piece of}} {{material}} which is strung up using rope as a minimalist, stand-alone shelter. In basic terms, a fly is a tent without walls. Purpose-made stand-alone flies are also sometimes referred to as bivouacs, bivvies, tarpaulins, or hootchies. Flies are generally used for keeping moisture (such as condensation or rain) or sun off people while they eat, rest or sleep. They can also be used as <b>groundsheets,</b> but this is not recommended since it creates wear and tear which can lead to holes.|$|R

5000|$|A basha is a {{waterproof}} canvas or plastic sheet with eyelets or loops on the perimeter, {{which is used}} in camping, outdoor, or military situations {{to act as a}} shelter, {{in the form of an}} impromptu tent and/or <b>groundsheet,</b> usually supported with rope or even bungee cords attached to trees.|$|E

The Trentham Camp was {{initially}} organised by the local YMCA volunteers. The FAFL pilot Marc Hauchemaille (1907-1942) recorded in his diary that... "There are 6 or 7,000 men in the camp - a miracle of English organisation - {{in a few hours}} we have tents, <b>groundsheets,</b> cooking utensils.", although proper medical facilities took longer to organise. Numbers at the camp appear to have lessened to 5,530 after the initial influx.|$|R
50|$|The Reichswehr (Army of the Weimar Republic) started {{experimenting with}} {{camouflage}} patterns for Wehrmacht uniforms before World War II, and some army units used Splittertarnmuster ("splinter camouflage pattern"), first issued in 1931, {{and based on}} Zeltbahn shelter halves/groundsheets. Waffen-SS combat units used various patterns from 1935 onwards. The SS camouflage patterns were designed by Johann Georg Otto Schick, a Munich art professor and then {{the director of the}} German camouflage research unit, at the request of an SS Major, Wim Brandt. Brandt was an engineer and the commander of the SS-VT reconnaissance battalion, and he was looking for better camouflage. Schick had researched the effect of light on trees in summer and in autumn. These led to the idea of reversible camouflage clothing, with green summer patterns on one side, brown autumn patterns on the other. In 1937, the patterns were field tested by the SS-VT Deutschland regiment, resulting in an estimate that they would cut casualties by fifteen percent. In 1938, a reversible spring/autumn helmet cover, smock, and sniper's face mask in Schick's forest patterns on waterproof cotton duck were patented for the Waffen-SS. The patent is said to have prevented the Wehrmacht from using the patterns, which became a distinctive emblem of the Waffen-SS during the war. Production of <b>groundsheets,</b> helmet covers and smocks by the Warei, Forster and Joring companies began in November 1938. They were initially hand-printed, limiting deliveries by January 1939 to only 8,400 <b>groundsheets</b> and 6,800 helmet covers and a small number of smocks. By June 1940, machine printing had taken over, and 33,000 smocks were made for the Waffen-SS. Supplies of high quality cotton duck, however, remained critically short throughout the war, and essentially ran out in January 1943. It was replaced by non-waterproof cotton drill cloth.|$|R
50|$|At {{the start}} of the war he became {{managing}} director (MD) of the Junior Army & Navy Stores; later he set up a factory which manufactured equipment for the British Army, such as canvas buckets and <b>groundsheets.</b> He was also MD of the Civil Service Co-operative Society (based in Haymarket) and of Booth & Brookes Ltd and T.T. Nethercoat & Co. Ltd. In the autumn of 1917 he visited the United States to promote the Junior Army & Navy Stores, where he launched an advertising campaign which led to a big increase in custom from American servicemen based in the United Kingdom. His various ventures made him a wealthy man, and by 1918 he was registered as the joint owner of No. 145 Oxford Street, and lived in Park Lane, which was then one of the city's most fashionable streets.|$|R

From here a short passage and another pitch leads to <b>Groundsheet</b> Junction where the Leck Fell Master Cave is entered.|$|E
50|$|Wapenshaw is also {{widely used}} in the Woodcraft Folk to {{describe}} a daily ceremony when camping, which involves each camper removing all belongings from their tent and laying them out on a <b>groundsheet</b> in a fixed order. This serves two purposes: to air out the tent, {{and to ensure that}} no items have been lost.|$|E
5000|$|In his 1892 book Mountaineering, Mummery's {{contemporary}} Clinton Dent gave {{a detailed}} description of the design. It was a ridge tent with low side walls, very similar to a current-day [...] "pup tent". The roof and wall material that he used was oiled silk. Tents were made in various sizes but 6 by 4 ft was typical, which could accommodate two people.The ice axe was being developed from the earlier alpenstock and by the 1880s was generally about 4 to 4.5 ft long. Mummery's revolutionary idea was to put them to additional use as tent poles [...] - [...] one at each end of the ridge and supported by guy ropes. The weight (excluding ice axes which were carried anyway) could be less than 2 pounds (1 kg) (3.5 lb with <b>groundsheet</b> and tent pegs). Unlike Whymper's tent, which usually had attached flooring, Mummery used a separate <b>groundsheet,</b> if he used one at all.|$|E
5|$|There {{were three}} {{trenches}} {{in a typical}} front line sector; the fire trench, the support trench and the reserve trench, all joined by communication trenches. The trenches varied in depth, but they were usually {{about four or five}} feet deep, or in areas with a high water table a wall of sandbags would be built to allow the defenders to stand upright, fire trenches were provided with a fire step, so the occupants could return fire during an attack (see diagram). Ideally, the bottom of the trench was lined with duckboards to prevent men from sinking into the mud and dugouts were cut into the walls, these gave shelter from the elements and shrapnel, although in the British Army dugouts were usually reserved for the officers and senior NCOs. The men were then expected to sleep wherever they could and in wet weather they lived under <b>groundsheets</b> or in tents {{at the bottom of the}} trench on the duckboards.|$|R
40|$|The mean skin {{temperatures}} {{as well as}} {{the temperatures}} of the hands, feet and forehead of small children were measured in nurseries at air temperatures of 20 degrees C and 22 degrees C. Differences were studied between babies remaining still, babies crawling on tiling, wooden floors or rubber foam <b>groundsheets</b> and older walking children. The results suggest that an air temperature of 22 degrees C leads to skin temperatures comparable to those observed for resting adults in comfort, while 20 degrees C seems to induce a slight but overall cooling of the body and considerable cooling of the extremities for the babies remaining still. The material of floor coverings should be considered carefully and preference given to low conductivity materials. Assuming that the optimum skin temperatures are the same for children amd for adults, it appears that the PMV-PPD approach can be used to predict this particular optimum comfort condition, provided an increase of 20 wm(- 2) is taken into account for the metabolic rate of the small children...|$|R
40|$|In {{the summer}} of 1815, a party of English {{tourists}} set out by voiture from Brussels {{to the field of}} Waterloo, scene of the recent defeat of the Imperial French army under the command of Napoleon Bonaparte. The ten-mile journey afforded numerous opportunities for picturesque reflections on the Flemish landscape; passing through Soignes, for example, the ancient forest whose trees provided a canopy from the glare of the August sun, the travellers may have recalled the literary associations with Boiardo’s Orlando and Shakespeare’s As You Like It. As many of the recently published guides to Waterloo took pains to point out, the felt contrast between the pastoral charms of the countryside and the grotesquerie of battle was an especially significant part of the Waterloo pilgrimage. Lulled into a state of repose under the shadows of the beech trees, the pilgrims could be forgiven for failing to detect the first bracing evidence of the effects of combat: fragments of paper from service books, torn letters, scraps of clothing, wheel ruts and the sickly, sweet odour of unburied flesh. In due course, however, the tourists would prepare their scented handkerchiefs, taking note, as the guidebook advised, of the affecting contrast between the verdure of Soignes and the coming scenes of despoliation. But standing as a buffer between the bucolic and the tragic is the mart, specifically the benches, tables and <b>groundsheets</b> on which the enterprising villagers of Waterloo displayed their wares. Alighting from the carriage, the tourists would be enticed to purchase a little piece of the battle: buttons, breastplates, sabres, caps, buckles, and other, less alluring objects: a calcified finger bone, a wooden denture, the tattered remains of a book of French chanson. To the would-be consumer of war, the field of battle speaks in broken accents, appealing for narrative completion, invoking a sense of lost totality. As the objects in the mart confirm, pathos is the currency of the battlefield experience, enabling the purchaser to exchange one set of values, the sympathetic detachment of the non-combatant, for another, the empathic identification of the virtual warrior. With that little piece of the real to hand, and with the guidebook and peasant guide to show the way (John DaCosta, Wellington’s guide on the day was the preferred choice), the visitor was now prepared to enter the field of battle.

50|$|Generally, Gahnia {{species can}} be proven {{difficult}} {{in regards to}} propagation. The best way to propagate cutting grass is by germination of seeds, due to limitations with division and transplantation of species.

50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} ways {{to put up a}} bivouac shelter. The most common method is to use one bivouac sheet as the roof of the shelter and a second as the <b>groundsheet.</b> The 'roof' flysheet is suspended along in its ridge line by a cord tied between two trees which are a suitable distance apart. The four corners of the flysheet are then either pegged out or tied down to other trees. Care must be taken to leave a gap between the ground and the sheet to ensure that there is enough air flow to stop condensation.|$|E

He recommended that two bamboo sticks [...] long should be taken to fit over the ends of the ice axes. These tents were among those used on the 1921 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition and two Mummeries were used at the East Rongbuk Glacier camp before and after the culminating ascent to the North Col.|$|E
50|$|Rain {{resistance}} is measured and expressed as hydrostatic head in millimetres (mm). This indicates {{the pressure of}} water needed to penetrate a fabric. Heavy or wind-driven rain has a higher pressure than light rain. Standing on a <b>groundsheet</b> increases the pressure on any water underneath. Fabric with a hydrostatic head rating of 1000 mm or less is best regarded as shower resistant, with 1500 mm being usually suitable for summer camping. Tents for year-round use generally have at least 2000 mm; expedition tents intended for extreme conditions are often rated at 3000 mm. Where quoted, groundsheets may be rated for 5000 mm or more.|$|E
50|$|A {{sleeping}} bag is an insulated covering for a person, essentially a lightweight quilt {{that can be}} closed with a zipper or similar means to form a tube, which functions as lightweight, portable bedding in situations where a person is sleeping outdoors (e.g. when camping, hiking, hill walking or climbing). Its primary purpose is to provide warmth and thermal insulation through its synthetic or down insulation. It also typically has a water-resistant or water-repellent cover that protects, to some extent, against wind chill and light precipitation, but a tent is usually used {{in addition to a}} {{sleeping bag}}, as it performs those functions better. The bottom surface also provides some cushioning, but a sleeping pad or camp cot is usually used in addition for that purpose. The bottom surface of a sleeping bag may be moderately water repellent, but a plastic tarp or <b>groundsheet</b> is often used to protect against moist ground.|$|E

5000|$|While St. Cyr {{starred in}} several movies, an acting career never really materialized. In 1953, {{with the help}} of Howard Hughes, St. Cyr landed her first acting job in a major motion picture in the Son of Sinbad. The film, {{described}} by one critic as [...] "a voyeur's delight", has St. Cyr as a principal member of a Baghdad harem populated with dozens of nubile starlets. The film was condemned by the Catholic Legion of Decency. St. Cyr also had a role in the movie version of Norman Mailer's The Naked and the Dead in 1958. In this film, St. Cyr plays 'Jersey Lili', a stripper in a Honolulu night-club and girlfriend of a soldier who boasts to his pals that he has her picture painted inside his <b>groundsheet.</b> Heavy edits of St. Cyr's night-club routine by censors result in some choppy editing in an otherwise finely crafted film. But St. Cyr's movie career was short lived, and typically she settled for playing a secondary role as a stripper, or playing herself. Her dancing is featured prominently in two Irving Klaw films, Varietease and Teaserama.|$|E
