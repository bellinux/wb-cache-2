5|$|Before the 1980s, the {{prognosis}} or expected outcome of DPB was poor, especially in cases with superinfection (the {{emergence of a}} new viral or bacterial infection, in addition to the currently occurring infection) by P.aeruginosa. DPB continued to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>high</b> mortality rate before generalized antibiotic treatment and oxygen therapy were beginning to be used routinely in the effort to manage symptoms. Around 1985, when long-term treatment with the antibiotic erythromycin became the standard for managing DPB, {{the prognosis}} significantly improved. In 1990, the association of DPB with HLA was initially asserted.|$|E

5|$|Globular {{clusters}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>high</b> star density, {{and therefore}} close interactions and near-collisions of stars occur relatively often. Due to these chance encounters, some exotic classes of stars, such as blue stragglers, millisecond pulsars and low-mass X-ray binaries, {{are much more}} common in globular clusters. A blue straggler is formed from the merger of two stars, possibly {{as a result of}} an encounter with a binary system. The resulting star has a higher temperature than comparable stars in the cluster with the same luminosity, and thus differs from the main sequence stars formed at the beginning of the cluster.|$|E

The Bristol Channel and Avon estuary <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>high</b> tidal range of , second only to Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada; and the gorge is relatively narrow and meandering, making it notoriously difficult to navigate. Several vessels have grounded in the gorge including the SS Demerara soon after her launch in 1851, the schooner Gipsy in 1878, the steam tug Black Eagle in 1861 and the Llandaff City.|$|E

5|$|Energy {{beam welding}} methods, namely {{laser beam welding}} and {{electron}} beam welding, are relatively new processes that have become quite popular in high production applications. The two processes are quite similar, differing most notably in their source of power. Laser beam welding employs a highly focused laser beam, while electron beam welding is done in a vacuum and uses an electron beam. Both <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>high</b> energy density, making deep weld penetration possible and minimizing {{the size of the}} weld area. Both processes are extremely fast, and are easily automated, making them highly productive. The primary disadvantages are their very high equipment costs (though these are decreasing) and a susceptibility to thermal cracking. Developments in this area include laser-hybrid welding, which uses principles from both laser beam welding and arc welding for even better weld properties, laser cladding, and x-ray welding.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of {{television}} channels, thousands {{of local and}} national radio stations, several dozen newspapers, a productive and profitable national cinema and a rapid growth of broadband Internet use all make up a very vibrant media industry in Turkey. In 2003 a total of 257 television stations and 1,100 radio stations were licensed to operate, and others operated without licenses. Of those licensed, 16 television and 36 radio stations reached national audiences. The majority of the audiences are shared among public broadcaster TRT and the network-style channels such as Kanal D, Show TV, ATV and Star TV. The broadcast media <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>high</b> penetration as satellite dishes and cable systems are widely available. The Radio and Television Supreme Council (RTÜK) is the government body overseeing the broadcast media. By circulation, the most popular newspapers are Posta, Hürriyet, Sözcü, Sabah and Habertürk.|$|E
5|$|NASA has speculated on the {{feasibility}} of mining the atmospheres of the outer planets, particularly for helium-3, an isotope of helium that is rare on Earth and could <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>high</b> value per unit mass as thermonuclear fuel. Factories stationed in orbit could mine the gas and deliver it to visiting craft. However, the Jovian system in general poses particular disadvantages for colonization because of the severe radiation conditions prevailing in Jupiter's magnetosphere and the planet's particularly deep gravitational well. Jupiter would deliver about 36Sv (3600rem) per day to unshielded colonists at Io and about 5.4Sv (540rems) per day to unshielded colonists at Europa, which is a decisive aspect {{due to the fact}} that already an exposure to about 0.75Sv over a period of a few days is enough to cause radiation poisoning, and about 5Sv over a few days is fatal.|$|E
