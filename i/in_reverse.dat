5|$|The sujet (syuzhet), or the {{presentation}} of the film, is structured with two timelines: one in color and one in black-and-white.

Back at Cameron's garage, Ferris sets the car on blocks and runs it <b>in</b> <b>reverse</b> to try to take miles off the odometer without success. Cameron finally snaps, and lets out his anger against his controlling father by repeatedly kicking the car. This causes it to fall off the blocks and race <b>in</b> <b>reverse</b> through the back of the garage and into the ravine below. Ferris offers to take the blame, but Cameron asserts he will stand up against his father.|$|E

5|$|How Brown Saw the Baseball Game, {{also known}} as How Jones Saw the Baseball Game, is an American short silent comedy film {{produced}} in 1907 and distributed by the Lubin Manufacturing Company.

During production, trick photography was used to achieve this effect.|$|E
5|$|It is safe {{to observe}} the total phase of a solar eclipse {{directly}} only when the Sun's photosphere is completely covered by the Moon, and not before or after totality. During this period, the Sun is too dim to be seen through filters. The Sun's faint corona will be visible, and the chromosphere, solar prominences, and possibly even a solar flare may be seen.

40|$|The {{effect of}} protein on the {{absorption}} and its second derivative spectra of Cibacron Blue 3 GA (CB) {{has been investigated}} <b>in</b> cationic <b>reversed</b> micelles compared with that in buffer solution. The spectra of CB is red-shifted {{with the addition of}} cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) in buffer solution due to electrostatic interaction between CB and CTAB, while spectra of CB <b>in</b> the <b>reversed</b> micelles have no significant shift. The anionic CB has electrostatic interactions with cationic CTAB and has affinity interaction with bovine serum albumin (BSA) or lysozyme <b>in</b> the <b>reversed</b> micelles. The second derivative spectra of CB have red-shifted compared with the presence of BSA <b>in</b> the <b>reversed</b> micelles, which might indicate the decrease of the polarity of the CB microenvironment <b>in</b> the <b>reversed</b> micelles. The absorption maximum (lambda(m)) of CB with BSA <b>in</b> the <b>reversed</b> micelles was blue-shifted compared with that in buffer solution at pH < pI, which indicated that the affinity interaction between CB and protein is different from <b>in</b> <b>reversed</b> micelles and aqueous buffer solution. The CB microenvironment <b>in</b> the <b>reversed</b> micelles is more polar than that of buffer solution. The effect of lysozyme and BSA on the absorption spectra of CB <b>in</b> the <b>reversed</b> micelles has the same trend although these proteins differ in molecular weight and pI.

5|$|Some prokaryotes use redox pairs {{that have}} only a small {{difference}} in midpoint potential. For example, nitrifying bacteria such as Nitrobacter oxidize nitrite to nitrate, donating the electrons to oxygen. The small amount of energy released in this reaction is enough to pump protons and generate ATP, {{but not enough to}} produce NADH or NADPH directly for use in anabolism. This problem is solved by using a nitrite oxidoreductase to produce enough proton-motive force to run part of the electron transport chain <b>in</b> <b>reverse,</b> causing complex I to generate NADH.|$|E
