A quick and simple method for determining vapour pressure using a conventional thermobalance and standard sample holders has been developed.

Cotton fabric was dyed with Liyuan Yellow F S reactive <b>dye</b> and cationic <b>UV</b> <b>absorber</b> CANFIX SUN was subsequently applied by exhaust method {{in order to improve}} light fastness property. The light fastness property of the dyed samples before and after the treatment using <b>UV</b> <b>absorber</b> was tested as per international standards. The results show that for all light, medium and dark shades the dye exhaustion and fixation percentages were very good.

Over fifty upholstery fabrics were initially evaluated and fourteen were selected for further study.

Furthermore none of the <b>UV</b> <b>absorbers</b> and antioxidants applied to the upholstery fabrics improved lightfastness properties substantially, so they cannot be recommended as additives to soil repellent finish formulations...|$|R

40|$|We present {{evidence}} that the outflowing <b>UV</b> <b>absorbers</b> in Seyfert 1 galaxies arise primarily in their inner narrow (emission) line regions (NLRs), based on similarities in their locations, kinematics, and physical conditions. 1) Hubble Space Telescope observations show that nearly all Seyfert galaxies have bright, central knots of [O III] emission in their NLRs with radii of tens of parsecs. These sizes are consistent with most previous estimates of the distances of <b>UV</b> (and X-ray) <b>absorbers</b> from their central continuum sources, and a recently obtained reliable distance of ~ 25 pc for a <b>UV</b> <b>absorber</b> in the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3783. 2) The nuclear emission-line knots {{in a sample of}} 10 Seyfert galaxies have velocity widths of 300 - 1100 km/s (half-width at zero intensity), similar to the radial velocities of most <b>UV</b> <b>absorbers.</b> The highest radial velocity for a Seyfert <b>UV</b> <b>absorber</b> to date is only - 2100 km/s, which is much lower than typical broad-line region (BLR) velocities.

Using a STIS spectrum of the nuclear emission-line knot in NGC 4151, obtained when the continuum and BLR fluxes were low, we are able to match the observed line ratios with photoionization models that require a component with Cg ~ 1 and an ionization parameter and hydrogen column density that are typical of <b>UV</b> <b>absorbers...</b>|$|R

In this study, an organic <b>UV</b> <b>absorber</b> coating that consist of a UV-curing paint, ethyl acetate, anhydrous alcohol, and BTZ- 1 was prepared, and the behaviour of this coating applied on OBS (sample D) when exposed to UV radiation was investigated. The colour characterization has demonstrated {{the efficiency of the}} organic <b>UV</b> <b>absorber</b> coating in promoting the stability of L* and ∆E*. The results of glossiness showed that the organic <b>UV</b> <b>absorber</b> coating exhibited a high gloss retention during weathering treatment. A positive correlation between CAs and SFE stabilities of samples and the application amount of the organic <b>UV</b> <b>absorber</b> (BTZ- 1) was noticed. The chemical structure of the coating after the addition of the organic <b>UV</b> <b>absorber</b> became more stable during exposure. The slight colour change, high gloss retention, slight CAs/SFE changes, and high functional group stability illustrate that the rate of degradation is much lower for sample D with the applied coat d than that for the control sample (A and B). In conclusion, the addition of the organic <b>UV</b> <b>absorber</b> improved the exterior durability of OBS. The coating d is considered to be the best UV shielding layer in this study and is effective in protecting OBS and reducing the surface photodegradation of the substrate and the coating.|$|R

This study aims {{to evaluate the}} relationship between women’s personal <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> use {{and the risk of}} B-cell NHL. Methods: A 1 : 1 matched population-based case-control study of women conducted in Los Angeles County recruited 986 case-control pairs. Case participants were diagnosed with histologic confirmed primary B-cell NHL between 2004 and 2008. Control participants were individually matched to the index cases by age, gender, race, and neighborhood of residence. Exposure information was obtained by in-person interviews. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was performed to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) of B-cell NHL associated with personal <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> use overall, by race, and by NHL subtypes, adjusting for potential confounders (alcohol status, smoking status, and education levels).; Results: Compared to women who had never used any <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> products, those who had ever used personal <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> had a 38 % greater risk for B-cell NHL (OR= 1. 38, 95 %CI= 1. 05 - 1. 31).

40|$|Background p-Phenylenediamine (PPD) is {{the primary}} patch test {{screening}} agent for <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> contact allergy, and approximately 100 different <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> chemicals are allowed. Objectives To examine whether PPD is an optimal screening agent for diagnosing <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> allergy or whether other clinically important sensitizers exist. Methods Two thousand nine hundred and thirty-nine consecutive patients in 12 dermatology clinics were patch tested with five <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> available from patch test suppliers. Furthermore, 22 frequently used <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> ingredients not available from patch test suppliers were tested in subgroups of approximate to 500 patients each. Results A positive reaction to PPD was found in 4. 5 % of patients, and 2. 8 % reacted to toluene- 2, 5 -diamine (PTD), 1. 8 % to p-aminophenol, 1 % to m-aminophenol, and 0. 1 % to resorcinol; all together, 5. 3 % (n= 156). Dying hair was the most frequently reported cause of the allergy (55. 4 %); so-called temporary henna' tattoos were the cause in 8. 5 % of the cases. p-Methylaminophenol gave a reaction in 20 patients (2. 2 %), 3 of them with clinical relevance, and no co-reaction with the above five well-known <b>hair</b> <b>dyes.</b> Conclusions <b>Hair</b> <b>dyes</b> are the prime cause of PPD allergy. PPD identifies the majority of positive reactions to PTD, p-aminophenol and m-aminophenol, but not all, which justifies additional testing with <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> ingredients from the used product...|$|R
