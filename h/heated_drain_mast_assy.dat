The goal of this thesis is describe influence of the behavior, health and production. In a stable, there are some important factors. One {{of them is a}} micro-climate. Cattle is very liable to body-heat stres, because of its not-so-good body <b>heat</b> <b>draining.</b> Another thing stockpeople should focus on is bedding. Wet or pouled bedding is not only uncomfortable, but it also can cause lactal glad and lower limb health problems. Limping and udder infection are very frequent problem of cattle breeding. In matter of cattle´s social behaviour, we must consider a it´s sense for hierarchy. Make groups by cattle´s age, size, or lactal phase and by other features. Enouhg space for feeding and a rest, to pretend any mutual aggressive interaction thus avoid stres or injuries of cattle. Although a care and an attitude of stockpeople is being underetimated in many cases, they play a big role in animal breeding. The behaviour of stockpeople, for example, has an influence on animal´s feelings about people. If a milker is calm and has positive attitude, cows are more accessible and calmer while are giving milk. That affects milk production and cow´s mood as well. A frequent topic to debate is prenatal stres of dairy cows. It is cause of taking calves away from their cow mother. However, opinions on this theme aren´t united and this topic is, as is stated at the beginnig of this paragraph, full of contradiction. If we want to provide comfort to dairy cows, the main target is to provide them a proper place to sleep in, rest in, feeding, to care about their bodies, etc. That also means, that we should provide them the oportunity to natural behaviour and treat them as living beings, that percieve stimulus from their environment...|$|R

The thesis goes over theory behind heat transfer and heat exchangers and presents the general solutions of domestic <b>drain</b> water <b>heat</b> recovery systems. Systems gone over in detail are the different general shower <b>drain</b> water <b>heat</b> recovery systems. Another part of the thesis is {{a case study of}} an actual shower <b>drain</b> water <b>heat</b> recovery system of a Finnish household. The purpose of the case study is to study the actual temperature increase of cold water in a <b>drain</b> water <b>heat</b> recovery unit and efficiency of such heat exchanger. An alternate goal is to study the difference in efficiency values and temperature gains between two heat exchangers of the same model, where the other has been used significantly more than the other. In other words, another target is to study the fouling effect. The calculations are done using real measurement data. The most important findings are that utilizing a shower <b>drain</b> <b>heat</b> recovery unit provides real energy savings in the long run, {{and that there is a}} significant difference of efficiency between a dirty and a clean <b>heat</b> exchanger. <b>Drain</b> water <b>heat</b> recovery systems provided as high as 15 °C increase in the temperature of cold water.

In modern construction, concrete slabs are usually cast above a layer of insulation such as expanded polystyrene, and the slab may contain underfloor heating pipes. However, there are still uses for a slab that is not insulated , typically in outbuildings which are not heated or cooled to room temperature. In those cases, casting the slab directly onto a rocky substrate will maintain the slab at or near the temperature of the substrate throughout the year, and can prevent both freezing and overheating.|$|R

40|$|To {{meet the}} {{increasing}} global energy demand with minimal green house effect, electrical energy {{is a viable}} option. But, it requires an efficient electrical power system with optimal loss. Towards this, superconducting materials represent a promising way of improving the existing systems. However, the efficiency may be affected by a small temperature increase due to electromagnetic losses induced by time-varying magnetic fields. To minimize this, two approaches can be considered (i) reduce the losses and (ii) improve the heat exchange with the cooling environment. Although experimental and theoretical studies of the superconducting losses have been extensively pursued [1], few {{attempts have been made}} to combine the 'losses' and the 'cooling' aspects in the current scenario. Such studies require a detailed characterization of magneto-thermal interaction of the superconductors, as well as fundamental aspects of <b>heat</b> <b>draining</b> by the cryogenic fluid. Towards this, numerical studies on natural convection in an enclosed cavity, interacting with a constant heat source (heater) are carried out to understand the cooling efficiency of the cryogenic fluids (viz., liquid nitrogen, silicon oil and water). Natural convection heat transfer in an enclosure continues to be an active research area, due to its significance for both fundamental interests and engineering applications. Majority of the published studies can be classified into two groups: enclosure heated from below and cooled from above (Rayleigh–Bénard problem) and differentially heated enclosures [2]. Considerable attention has been given to natural convection from vertical/horizontal enclosures specified either with constant temperature or heat flux, while limited studies has been done with constant volumetric heat source [3]. The resulting characteristics of fluid flow and heat transfer are quite interesting and deserve a detailed investigation, which motivates for the present work. As a priori, three dimensional steady forms of incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved through finite volume approach [4]. Detailed flow features are presented in terms of velocity, temperature and path line profiles for different heater lengths. Comparative analyses are further reinforced in terms of average Nusselt number (Nu) for different fluids. It shows that, effective heat transfer enhancement occurs for liquid nitrogen with the shortest heater length, resulting in an efficient cooling. The profile of temperature and velocity magnitude distributions agrees well with the in-house experiment. Benchmark validation is found to be satisfactorily against the reported result [5]. Complete descriptions on geometrical details, governing equations, boundary conditions and solution methodology adopted for the numerical solution will be provided in full length paper. This study will be a gateway for further magneto-thermal analysis in an electromagnetic environment...|$|R
