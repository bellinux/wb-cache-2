50|$|After rescuing Keenbean from captivity, {{the kids}} and Diane manage to sneak both Richie and Cadbury back into Rich Manor, only to {{discover}} that the Dadlink shows that Richie's parents are inside Rich Manor. He is shocked to discover that Van Dough had anticipated his own arrival, and had arranged for his parents' rescue. Held at gunpoint, Van Dough forces the Rich family elders to reveal the location of the Rich vault, while Ferguson and his partner take Richie and his friends to the molecular reorganizer. Once in the lab, Keenbean manages to subdue both Ferguson and his partner with some very sticky substance, but ends up stuck as well; thinking cleverly, he uses a remote to power a robotic bee he created to sting Ferguson, causing him to crash into the machine's <b>emergency</b> <b>off</b> button, and thus saving Richie and the others.|$|E

30|$|In {{view of the}} {{considerations}} outlined above, <b>emergency</b> <b>off</b> and overrule functions must {{be realized}} in terms of information technology {{as a matter of}} principle, given the risk potential of partially autonomously operating service robots. 6 Special possibilities with regard to the division of tasks derive from the optical, acoustic and haptic signal processing systems that robots are increasingly equipped with. This could enable users to program robots by way of natural speech or special teaching methods (such as demonstration-imitation). Some {{progress has been made in}} the programming of robots in recent years, enabling the robots to be controlled by manual operating devices ("gaming console") (Klempert 2012), the manual guidance of robots (Mentgen 2011), the utilization of tablet computers (Innovationsagentur für IT und Medien 2011), as well as imitation learning (Institut für Anthropomatik 2012) and speech commands (Hochschule Ulm 2012). All this facilitates the flexible deployment of service robots also by technically unskilled persons. At the same time, elements have been developed such as safety light curtains, trunk-like robot arms, foam protective layers for robots with food sensors with which robot movements can be stopped depending on human action or slowed down. These measures serve to improve safety in work systems shared by humans and robots below the emergency-off level (cf. Mentgen 2011, for example).|$|E
40|$|Comunicación presentada en International Oil Spill Conference, celebrada del 15 al 19 de mayo de 2005 en Miami Beach, Florida (Estados Unidos) Publicado en "IOSC Proceedings" 2005 (1) : 613 - 617 On November 13 th, 2002 the 26 {{year old}} tanker Prestige {{reported}} an <b>emergency</b> <b>off</b> the North Western Spanish coast (Galicia). The ship was carrying 77, 000 tons of {{heavy fuel oil}} that started to be spilled while the vessel was towed away from the coast, affecting more than 900 km of shoreline. The location {{and the way the}} accident occurred implied a great challenge for the organization and coordinaton of actions to fight against the oil pollution. The site, just off the Finis terre cap, is a complex region from the oceanographic point of view and weather conditions, and this facilitated the fuel transport and spread over a great area. In order to take rapid preventive actions, it was crucial to have accurate spill trajectory forecasts covering direction and coastal impact. Under the coordination of public agencies and Spanish academic and research institutions, an operational monitoring system was built including wind and wave forecast, oil spill dispersion models, and visual inspection flights. Although the use of lagrangian floats was made in other incidents in the past (i. e Erika tanker) the characteristics of the Prestige accident indicated the need to deploy a relative great number of buoys as a major novelty respect to similar accidents in the past. The purpose of this contribution is to describe the operational actions performed during this particular accident, and to show the use of Lagrangian floats as an efficient procedure to improve the management and advice for such catastrophic eventsThis a contribution to the Spanish Project ESEOO (VEM 2003 - 20577) funded by the Spanish National Plan of Research and DevelopmentPeer Reviewe...|$|E

This survey aimed to provide a statistically representative picture of working parents' views and preferences with respect to leave arrangements to facilitate support for their children. Over 1, 000 parents in employment, working eight hours or more per week, were surveyed across Great Britain during autumn 2000. The survey was timed in order to inform the Government's 'Work and Parents: Competitiveness and Choice' Green Paper, published in December 2000. The survey examined the following issues: parents' take-up of the statutory leave entitlements introduced under the Employment Relations Act 1999, and employers' 'top-up' provisions (covering maternity/paternity leave, <b>emergency</b> time <b>off</b> to care for dependants, and parental leave; parents' reasons for non-take-up of existing provisions; parents' preferences with respect to employers' provisions and views on the practicability of employers extending existing provisions.

5000|$|During {{its peak}} hours, Floatopia was patrolled {{by a dozen}} Foot Patrol {{officers}}, Goleta deputies, and officers from the UCSB police department, 4 county fire engines, 2 ambulances, a search and rescue crew, and a helicopter. Lt. Brian Olmstead of the Isla Vista Foot Patrol stated that about 20 county firefighters {{were assigned to the}} event. The main problem was that Floatopia required so many officials to be present that it caused a redistribution of safety personnel. Olmstead stated,"this event {{had an impact on the}} county as a whole." [...] The increased size of Floatopia caught <b>emergency</b> officials <b>off</b> guard and cost an estimated $20,000 in taxpayer money to patrol.|$|R

Both stations were demolished later. As well as modernising the facilities and appearance, the redevelopment improved connections between the station and the surrounding commercial and residential areas. The station now has a concourse level above the platforms, and entrances from a new square off Broadway, a 65m long covered bridge (capable of carrying <b>emergency</b> vehicles) <b>off</b> Remuera Road, and a pedestrian bridge from Joseph Banks Terrace, from the Remuera side.|$|R

50|$|A severe {{snowstorm}} {{has closed}} nearly all Midwestern airports, thus forcing the crippled aircraft with its badly wounded passengers to endure a three-hour flight to Chicago. The extended flight time puts {{the survival of}} the wounded pilot and passenger tended by Dr. Mannheim, in a precarious state and it is questionable whether the co-pilot and flight engineer will have sufficient control to land the aircraft safely. A crosswind makes the landing at Chicago extremely tricky and Burkhart and Fuller must wrestle with the controls to keep the 727 from veering off the runway. The pilots see the <b>emergency</b> vehicles <b>off</b> to the aircraft's right as they touch down on the runway with several hard bounces. As the 727 slows down, the pilots must continue their fight to keep the aircraft under control.|$|R
50|$|A kill switch, {{also known}} as an {{emergency}} stop (e-stop) or <b>emergency</b> power <b>off</b> (EPO), is a safety mechanism used to shut off a device or machinery in an emergency situation in which it cannot be shut down in the usual manner. Unlike a normal shut-down switch/procedure, which shuts down all systems {{in an orderly fashion}} and turns the machine off without damaging it, a kill switch is designed and configured to completely and as quickly as possible abort the operation (even if this damages equipment) and be operable {{in a manner that is}} quick and simple (so that even a panicking operator with impaired executive function or a bystander can activate it). Kill switches are usually designed so as to be obvious even to an untrained operator or a bystander.|$|R
50|$|Mars {{proves to}} be inhospitable, and they {{struggle}} to survive with their decreased water supply. Earth's correct orbital position for a return trip is one year away. While glumly celebrating their first Christmas on Mars, a sudden snowstorm blows in, allowing them to replenish their water supply. As their launch window arrives, they hear low rumbling sounds, then see rocks falling, and feel the ground shake violently. The ground level shifts during this violent Marsquake. Their spaceship is now leaning at a precarious angle and cannot make an <b>emergency</b> blast <b>off.</b> To right the spaceship, the crew uses the rocket engines' powerful thrust to shift the ground under the landing legs.
