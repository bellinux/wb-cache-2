As soil fauna are sensitive to environmental changes, increases in soil nitrogen (N) availability resulting from global changes may profoundly influence the structure and function <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> faunal communities. However, the response <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> fauna in forest ecosystems to increases in soil N availability is still poorly understood. In order to explore the relationship between soil N availability and soil fauna, we examined the effects of N addition on the density, grouping and feeding habits <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> fauna in larch (Larix gmelinii) and ash (Fraxinus mandshurica) plantations in northeastern China from 2008 to 2009. Our results showed that N addition changed the structure <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> fauna communities in both plantations. After N addition in the larch plantation, <b>densities</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> fauna in surface soil layers (0 – 10 cm) increased by an average of 12 % (July) and 15 % (October) in 2008, whereas they decreased by 22 % (May) and 20 % (July) in 2009. A similar pattern occurred in the ash plantation—densities increased by an average of 14 % (July) and 8 % (October) in 2008, and decreased by 22 % (May) and 9 % (July) in 2009. In contrast, <b>densities</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> fauna in subsurface layers (10 – 20 cm) increased in both plantations only in July of 2008 and then decreased significantly (25 % in larch and 21 % in ash) in following samples. The number <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> faunal groups increased from 34 to 43 in the larch plantation and from 43 to 48 in the ash plantation post N addition. In both plantations, N addition altered the <b>densities</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> fauna with different feeding habits, with a decrease in soil detritivores and an increase in soilherbivores and no change in soil predators. These findings indicated that increasing soil N availability significantly altered the density, and community composition in terms of feeding habits, <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> fauna in both plantations, thereby potentially influencing belowground carbon allocation and nutrient cycling at the ecosystem level...|$|R

40|$|Bacterial wilt is {{a serious}} soilborne disease of Solanaceae crops which is caused by Ralstonia solanacearum. The {{important}} role of biochar in enhancing disease resistance in plants has been verified; however, the underlying mechanism remains not fully understood. In this study, two different biochars, made from peanut shell (BC 1) and wheat straw (BC 2), were added to Ralstonia solanacearum-infected soil to explore the interrelation among biochar, tomato bacterial wilt, and soil microbial properties. The results showed that both BC 1 and BC 2 treatments significantly reduced the disease index of bacterial wilt by 28. 6 % and 65. 7 %, respectively. The populations of R. solanacearum in soil were also significantly decreased by biochar application. Ralstonia solanacearum infection significantly reduced the <b>densities</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> bacteria and actinomycetes and increased the ratio <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> fungi/bacteria in the soil. By contrast, BC 1 and BC 2 addition to pathogen-infected soil significantly increased the <b>densities</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> bacteria and actinomycetes but decreased the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> fungi and the ratios <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> fungi/bacteria and fungi/actinomycetes.

40|$|Soil slips occur {{every few}} years due to heavy rains on biotite granite (Gb) and {{hornblende}} biotite granite (Ghb) slopes in the Taga Mountains, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan. The occurrence <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> slips per unit area is 2. 7 times greater in the Gb slopes than that in Ghb slopes. We examined the chemical, mineral, physical, and mechanical properties of two soil profiles on soil-slip scars in these slopes to study the effect of bedrock mineral composition on the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> slips. For a given size of mineral grain, the amount of biotite (which is susceptible to chemical weathering) in granitic bedrocks strongly influenced the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> slips. In the Gb slope the soil layer becomes thinner because of the smaller proportion of biotite in the bedrock; this restricts the downward movement of soil water into the material below the slip plane. During heavy rainfall the water surface then rises toward the slope surface above the slip plane. This promotes soil slips, increasing the density of soil-slip scars. In contrast, in the Ghb slope, with more biotite in the bedrock, the soil layer becomes thicker, so that soil water moves easily into the material beneath the slip plane. This limits the rise of water surface toward the slope surface above the slip plane even during heavy rainfalls. There are consequently fewer soil slips and density of soil-slip scars...|$|E
