5|$|Marriage {{negotiations}} {{constituted a}} key element in Elizabeth's foreign policy. She turned down Philip's own hand early in 1559 but for several years entertained the proposal of King Eric XIV of Sweden. For several years she also seriously negotiated to marry Philip's cousin Archduke Charles of Austria. By 1569, relations with the Habsburgs had deteriorated, and Elizabeth considered marriage to two French Valois princes in turn, first Henry, Duke of Anjou, and later, from 1572 to 1581, his brother Francis, Duke of Anjou, formerly Duke of Alençon. This last proposal was tied to a planned alliance against Spanish control of the Southern Netherlands. Elizabeth seems to have taken the courtship seriously for a time, and wore a frog-shaped earring that Anjou <b>had</b> <b>sent</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
5|$|In May 1908, five American missionaries—John G. Lake and Thomas Hezmalhalch, {{along with}} their wives, and A. Lehman—arrived in South Africa from Indianapolis. Lake and Hezmalhalch had links to Dowie's Zion City and had been baptized in the Holy Spirit at the Azusa Street Mission in Los Angeles. Despite these influences, however, the missionaries had no {{organizational}} affiliation. Arriving in Pretoria, Lake felt that the Holy Spirit was leading him to Johannesburg because they found no doors open in Pretoria. In Johannesburg, a Mrs Goodenough met them and invited them to stay in her house. She witnessed that the Holy Spirit <b>had</b> <b>sent</b> <b>her</b> {{to the train station}} to meet the American missionaries. They first began ministry at a rental hall in Doornfontein, a Johannesburg suburb, on 25 May 1908. The services consisted of a mixed racial group, and many who attended the first services were Zionists. The missionaries moved to the Central Tabernacle, Bree Street, Johannesburg as the young Pentecostal movement grew. It was there that the Apostolic Faith Mission developed, initially as a committee first meeting in September 1908. It was not registered as a legal entity until 1913, however.|$|E

25|$|Two months later, Lisa {{is back at}} {{home with}} a {{rejection}} slip from a publishing company to whom she <b>had</b> <b>sent</b> <b>her</b> Equalia manuscript. Homer is then prompted to make his own fantasy story, based on his experiences as a father, which goes no further than him re-imagining the family in forms more pleasing to him: Bart is a hot dog, Lisa is a starfish, Marge is a bottle of Duff Beer, and Maggie is a monster truck.|$|E
25|$|In September 2016, MailOnline {{published}} a lengthy interview and screenshots from a 15-year-old girl {{who claimed that}} the American politician Anthony Weiner <b>had</b> <b>sent</b> <b>her</b> sexually explicit images and messages. The revelation led to Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin—an aide of Hillary Clinton—separating. In late October, {{less than two weeks}} before the presidential election, FBI director James Comey stated that files found on Weiner's devices may be relevant to Clinton's email controversy. Weiner pleaded guilty in May 2017 to sending obscene material to a minor, and in September he was jailed for 21 months.|$|E

In an interview, she said that while under house arrest she spent her time reading philosophy, politics and biographies that her husband <b>had</b> <b>sent</b> <b>her.</b> She also passed the time playing the piano, and was occasionally allowed visits from foreign diplomats as well as from her personal physician.|$|E
25|$|When Victoria, Queen of the United Kingdom, in 1867 {{failed to}} answer a letter Tewodros II of Ethiopia <b>had</b> <b>sent</b> <b>her,</b> he took it as an insult and imprisoned several British residents, {{including}} the consul. An army of 12,000 was sent from Bombay to Ethiopia to rescue the captured nationals, {{under the command of}} Sir Robert Napier. The Ethiopians were defeated, and the British stormed the fortress of Magdala (now known as Amba Mariam) on April 13, 1868. When the Emperor heard that the gate had fallen, he fired a pistol into his mouth and killed himself. Sir Robert Napier was raised to the peerage, and given the title of Lord Napier of Magdala.|$|E
25|$|Domne Eafe <b>had</b> <b>sent</b> <b>her</b> {{daughter}} Mildrith to Chelles in France, {{to study}} under abbess Wilcoma, where she also collected relics. After having been treated harshly by the abbess, (including {{an attempt to}} roast her alive for refusing to marry a relative of the abbess) she fled back to Kent. On landing at Ebbsfleet, the imprint of her sandal was made in a rock, which later had a chapel built over it. Mildrith became a nun at Thanet, and later succeeded her mother to become the second Abbess. On her death (on July 13th) she {{was buried in the}} Church of St Mary, but her successor, Eadburh, built a second Church at Thanet, St Peter and St Paul, and translated her still incorrupt remains there.|$|E

25|$|In October 1969, police {{raided the}} Family's new {{residence}} at Barker Ranch near Death Valley, California, holding {{most of the}} group in custody on charges of automobile theft. Among those arrested were Atkins, who, while being questioned by police sergeants Whitley and Guenther on October 13, 1969, implicated herself {{in the murder of}} Hinman and told the officers that Manson <b>had</b> <b>sent</b> <b>her</b> and Beausoleil to Hinman's residence to force Hinman to hand over money that Manson believed Hinman had inherited. Atkins also told the police that Beausoleil alone acted in the murder of Hinman, stabbing him twice in the heart after detaining him in his home for over two days. Atkins also maintained that it was Beausoleil who slashed Hinman's face, not Manson. However, Atkins gave several differing accounts of the murder of Hinman; at times claiming that she killed Hinman, Manson killed Hinman or that Beausoleil killed Hinman.|$|E
25|$|After {{his wife}} had gotten seriously ill, Päts {{found out that he}} was no longer {{condemned}} to death in the Russian Empire. He moved back to Estonia in 1909, to face only minor charges. From February 1910, he served time in Kresty Prison in Saint Petersburg, while his wife died of tuberculosis in Switzerland, where Päts <b>had</b> <b>sent</b> <b>her</b> for treatment. During his imprisonment, he was able to study foreign languages and write articles, to be published in newspapers. Päts was released on 25March 1911. The governor of the Governorate of Estonia complained about Päts's activity in Estonia in 1905 and pleaded for the government not to let him return and he was banned from living in the Governorates of Estonia and Livonia for six years. However, strong connections with Jaan Poska helped him return to Estonia, where he founded another newspaper, Tallinna Teataja ("The Tallinn Gazette").|$|E
25|$|On 23 October Pitt was {{anchored}} in Môle-Saint-Nicolas at the north-west {{end of the}} island of Haiti. Towards evening a lookout sighted two sails, with it looking like one was pursuing the other. Because the weather was calm, they were moving slowly. Fitton weighed anchor and with his crew at the sweeps set out in pursuit. In the morning he spotted three schooners, the largest of which appeared to be a privateer. As Pitt approached the privateer fired her 6-pounders but without effect because of the distance. The three schooners continued to make their way towards the port of Baracoa, Cuba, some 70 miles west. Pitts crew manned their sweeps throughout the night though at dawn a breeze gave them a respite. They caught up with the privateer outside Baracoa. She <b>had</b> <b>sent</b> <b>her</b> two prizes into the port and was awaiting the British.|$|E

500|$|Miranda Keyes was {{voiced by}} Julie Benz in Halo 2, but Bungie recast the role for Halo 3, ostensibly {{because they wanted}} someone with an accent. Despite not {{being a part of}} Halo 3, Benz said that she loved voiceover work and that it was pure chance she had become the voice of Keyes in the first place. When IGN asked Benz what she thought of her character, she {{admitted}} she hadn't played Halo 2, even though Bungie <b>had</b> <b>sent</b> <b>her</b> [...] "like four copies of the game." [...] The character is voiced by Justis Bolding in Halo 3.|$|E
500|$|... "Touch Me Like That" [...] {{was written}} by record {{producer}} Jason Nevins and singer/songwriter Lisa Molina.

On February 16, Banks shared a music video for her remix on Vimeo, and revealed a purported e-mail from Baauer saying he liked the remix.

500|$|White {{men began}} {{surrounding}} houses, pouring kerosene on and lighting them, then shooting {{at those who}} emerged.

She {{was killed by a}} shotgun blast to the face when she fled from hiding underneath her home, which had been set on fire by the mob. Fannie Taylor's brother-in-law claimed to be her killer. On January 5, more whites converged on the area, forming a mob of between 200 and 300 people. [...] Some came from out of state. Mingo Williams, who was [...] away near Bronson, was collecting turpentine sap {{by the side of the}} road when a car full of whites stopped and asked his name.

500|$|After the Armada the Earl {{was seen}} riding in splendour through London [...] "as {{if he were}} a king", and for the last few weeks of his life he usually dined with the Queen, a unique favour. On his way to Buxton in Derbyshire to take the baths, he died at Cornbury Park near Oxford, on 4 September 1588. Leicester's health had not been good for some time; historians have {{considered}} malaria and stomach cancer as causes of death. His death came unexpectedly, and only a week earlier he had said farewell to his Queen. Elizabeth was deeply affected and locked herself in her apartment for a few days until Lord Burghley had the door broken. Her nickname for Dudley had been [...] "Eyes", which was symbolised by the sign of ôô in their letters to each other. Elizabeth kept the letter he <b>had</b> <b>sent</b> <b>her</b> six days before his death in her bedside treasure box, endorsing it with [...] "his last letter" [...] on the outside. It was still there when she died 15 years later on 24 March 1603.|$|E
500|$|Koch and Eide {{claimed that}} Cho had been {{involved}} in at least three stalking incidents, two of which resulted in verbal warnings by the Virginia Tech campus police. The first such alleged stalking incident occurred on November 27, 2005. After the incident, according to Koch, Cho claimed to have sent an instant message online to the female student by AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) and found out where she lived on the campus. Eide stated that Cho then visited her room to see if she was [...] "cool", adding that Cho remarked that he only found [...] "promiscuity in her eyes". Eide added that, when Cho visited the female student, Cho said, [...] "Hi, I'm Question Mark" [...] to her, [...] "which really freaked her out." [...] The female student called the campus police, complaining that Cho <b>had</b> <b>sent</b> <b>her</b> annoying messages and made an unannounced visit to her room. Two uniformed members of the campus police visited Cho's room at the dormitory later that evening and warned him not to contact the female student again. Cho made no further contact with the student.|$|E
