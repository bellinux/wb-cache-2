This is exemplified by Marcus Aurelius's observation that a man's place in that relationship: [...] "He who <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> what the world is <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> where he is, and he who <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> for what purpose the world exists, <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> who he is, nor what the world is." ...|$|R

5|$|Information {{concerning}} the soft anatomy of Amphidromus is widely scattered and fragmentary.

Unfortunately, although {{it is clear that}} anatomical differences exist in the two species Jacobi dissected, unfortunately we <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> which forms he worked on, because he had incorrectly identified his material. In his paper he referred to the two species as Amphidromus chloris and the interruptus phase of A. perversus. However, that is not possible, because in reality Amphidromus chloris is a species found only in the Philippine Islands, and the interruptus phase of A. perversus is not present in the Natuna Islands.|$|E

Analysis of observations including both stationary and mobile (surface and aerial) in-situ and remote sensing (passive and active) instruments generates new ideas and refines existing notions. Numerical modeling also provides new insights as observations and new discoveries are integrated into our physical understanding and then tested in computer simulations which validate new notions as well as produce entirely new theoretical findings, {{many of which are}} otherwise unattainable. Importantly, development of new observation technologies and installation of finer spatial and temporal resolution observation networks have aided increased understanding and better predictions.|$|E

5|$|After 3.dxe5 Black can try the Fajarowicz {{variation}} 3...Ne4 which {{concentrates on}} the rapid development of pieces, but the most common move is 3...Ng4 with three main possibilities for White. The Adler variation 4.Nf3 sees White seeking a spatial advantage in the centre with his pieces, notably the important d5-square. The Alekhine variation 4.e4 gives White an important spatial advantage and a strong pawn centre. The Rubinstein variation 4.Bf4 leads to an important choice for White, after 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+, between 6.Nbd2 and 6.Nc3. The reply 6.Nbd2 brings a positional game in which White enjoys the bishop pair and tries to break through on the queenside, while 6.Nc3 keeps the material advantage of a pawn {{at the cost of}} a weakening of the white pawn structure. Black usually looks to have an aggressive game (many lines can shock opponents that <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> the theory) or cripple White's pawn structure.|$|E
5|$|By {{this stage}} Rome's entire {{position}} on the Rhine and even in Gaul was imperiled. Their civil war over, the Romans mustered a huge task force of eight legions (five dispatched from Italy, two from Spain and one from Britain) to deal with Civilis. Its commander Petillius Cerialis had to fight two difficult battles, at Trier and Xanten, before he could overrun the Batavi's homeland. Tacitus' surviving narrative breaks off as he describes a meeting on {{an island in the}} Rhine delta between Civilis and Cerialis to discuss peace terms. We <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> the outcome of this meeting or Civilis' ultimate fate. But in view of his former friendship with Vespasian, who had already offered him a pardon, {{and the fact that the}} Romans still needed the Batavi levies, it is likely that the terms were lenient by Roman standards.|$|E

They can correspond in English. So I could have it as an alternate language as long as people require it and the decision for that – I would leave not to the Hindi-knowing people, but to the non-Hindi-knowing people.|$|E

5|$|In the North Atlantic, two {{stocks of}} B. m. musculus are recognised. The first is found off Greenland, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. This group is {{estimated}} to total about 500. The second, more easterly group is spotted from the Azores in spring to Iceland in July and August; it is presumed the whales follow the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between the two volcanic islands. Beyond Iceland, blue whales have been spotted {{as far north as}} Spitsbergen and Jan Mayen, though such sightings are rare. Scientists <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> where these whales spend their winters. The total North Atlantic population {{is estimated to}} be between 600 and 1,500. Off Ireland, the first confirmed sightings were made in 2008, since then Porcupine Seabight has been regarded as a prominent habitat for the species along with fin whales. One was sighted along Galicia, Spain, in 2017.|$|E
5|$|The Turks {{began to}} apply {{restrictions}} on Jewish immigration to Palestine in late 1882, {{in response to}} the start of the First Aliyah earlier that year. Although this immigration was creating a certain amount of tension with the local population, mainly among the merchant and notable classes, in 1901 the Sublime Porte (the Ottoman central government) gave Jews the same rights as Arabs to buy land in Palestine and the percentage of Jews in the population rose to 7% by 1914. At the same time, with growing distrust of the Young Turks – Turkish nationalists who had taken control of the Empire in 1908 – and the Second Aliyah, Arab nationalism was on the rise, and in Palestine anti-Zionism was a unifying characteristic. Historians <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> whether these strengthening forces would still have ultimately resulted in conflict in the absence of the Balfour Declaration.|$|E
