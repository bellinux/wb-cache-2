40|$|In recent years, various tobacco ‘endgame ’ {{strategies}} {{have been suggested}} {{as a means to}} phase out tobacco consumption. Using country examples, this paper discusses three potential strategies: replacing cigarettes with alternative products (harm reduction), denying tobacco sales to people born after a certain year (the tobacco-free generation proposal), and <b>further</b> <b>implementing</b> <b>measures</b> based on the WHO Framework Convention for Tobacco Control (FCTC) treaty. It is argued that all {{strategies have}} potential issues that could be avoided by combining them into an integrated, sequential endgame that, first, using measures recommended in the WHO FCTC, creates a climate that facilitates the phasing out of cigarettes; second, implements a generational phase out of cigarette sales; and third, simultaneously permits the regulated use of alternative nicotine products. Thus, integrating ideas from various endgame strategies will result in a more effective, resilient tobacco endgame policy...|$|E
50|$|Shortly {{after the}} European Commission, the IMF and ECB {{set up a}} {{tripartite}} committee (the Troika) to prepare an appropriate programme of economic policies underlying a massive loan. The Troika was led by Servaas Deroose, from the European Commission, and included also Poul Thomsen (IMF) and Klaus Masuch (ECB) as junior partners. In return the Greek government agreed to <b>implement</b> <b>further</b> <b>measures.</b> Servaas Deroose was later replaced by Matthias Mors as representative of the European Commission.|$|R
50|$|The main {{duties of}} the {{ministry}} were to develop and to prepare these for legislation and to maintain a decent level of health organisation in the USSR. The ministry missariat monitored and supervised the application of standards and measures to improve Soviet health care. According to the July 1936 decree establishing the People's Commissariat for Health, the commissariat had control over all financial assets related or linked to health care. As such, the ministry controlled all financial functions regarding health. It coordinated medical personnel all over the country, but also local council deputies. MOH was obliged to take active measures against deficiencies {{in the health care}} system, and to <b>further</b> develop and <b>implement</b> <b>measures</b> to improve it.|$|R

[...] Despite the negative attention the mall has received, municipal leaders continue to stress that [...] "Monroeville Mall is a very safe, family-oriented," [...] destination which continues to anchor the largest concentration of businesses and commerce in the eastern suburbs of the Pittsburgh Metropolitan Area.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate Romania`s capacity to fulfill the nominal convergence criteria in the current context, in order respect the calendar proposed for euro adoption in 2015. I analyzed the evolution of all five criteria under the impact of the current financial crisis and I also looked as the forecast provided by national and international authorities. The analysis had been made considering the comparative situation with euro area or with other member states. The main finding is that actual target for euro adoption could be respected, provided further progresses are made and also should be respected, as it would represent a strong stimulus for the local government to <b>implement</b> <b>further</b> <b>measures</b> to alleviate public indebtedness and to reduce inflationary pressure...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} extent to which G 20 green {{stimulus}} initiatives enacted during the 2008 – 9 recession have instigated a global ‘green recovery’, and how further green recovery policy initiatives by the G 20 relate to concerns about chronic fiscal deficits and global imbalances. <b>Implementing</b> <b>further</b> green <b>measures</b> will require G 20 economies to commit to increased public investments, new pricing policies, improving regulations, more aid disbursements and other policy changes. Although there may be concern that these additional initiatives could worsen the chronic fiscal deficits and structural imbalances, if properly enacted, such a green economic recovery strategy should help alleviate, rather than worsen, unstably large fiscal deficits, long-term real interest rate rises and inflation, and global imbalances. ...|$|R
500|$|Gaddafi {{summarised}} Third International Theory {{in three}} short volumes published between 1975 and 1979, collectively known as The Green Book. Volume one {{was devoted to}} the issue of democracy, outlining the flaws of representative systems in favour of direct, participatory GPCs. The second dealt with Gaddafi's beliefs regarding socialism, while the third explored social issues regarding the family and the tribe. While the first two volumes advocated radical reform, the third adopted a socially conservative stance, proclaiming that while men and women were equal, they were biologically designed for different roles in life. During the years that followed, Gaddafists adopted quotes from The Green Book, such as [...] "Representation is Fraud", as slogans. Meanwhile, in September 1975, Gaddafi <b>implemented</b> <b>further</b> <b>measures</b> to increase popular mobilization, introducing objectives to improve the relationship between the Councils and the ASU.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to examine the {{long-term}} changes in inhalation exposure to flour dust in the UK. Flour dust data held in the UK National Exposure DataBase (NEDB) and from one large company from 1985 to 2003 were reviewed. Analysis of the log-transformed data was carried out using linear mixed effect models and expressed as the relative annual change in exposure. 1451 inhalable flour dust measurements were analysed. The overall mean flour dust levels ranged from 7. 8 mg m(- 3) in the bakeries to 17. 9 mg m(- 3) in the flour mills. Analysis of the data obtained from NEDB and industry revealed no statistically significant temporal trends in exposure. Considering these high levels have persisted over the last 20 years, there is a need for government and industry to <b>implement</b> <b>further</b> <b>measures</b> aimed at reducing flour dust exposures and the risk of developing occupational asthma...|$|R
40|$|Public Health Relevance: This {{literature}} review seeks {{to discuss the}} overall cost burden, impact, epidemiology, pathogenesis, preventative measures to assist in understanding Clostridium difficile as a pathogen and <b>implement</b> <b>further</b> effective <b>measures</b> of prevention and policy. Clostridium difficile is well-known as a hospital-acquired infection (HAI). By means of its toxins TcdA and TcdB, Clostridium difficile causes debilitating illness in hospitals. Clostridium difficile {{is known to be}} resistant to a number of antimicrobial agents, which further complicates treatment. Recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is oftentimes treated with fecal transplants, which {{has been shown to be}} highly effective at curing recurrent CDI. Treatment, however, is known to incur high costs overall every year. Because of this, prevention methods are essential to controlling the transmission of disease and associated costs. Prevention should revolve around environmental sanitation through use of UV light treatment and sporicidal cleaners. Prevention methods should also target behaviors (i. e. hand-hygiene, antimicrobial prescription frequency) through education of healthcare workers and patients alike...|$|R
