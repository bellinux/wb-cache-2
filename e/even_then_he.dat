5|$|Although Charles Holden had {{gradually}} reduced his workload, he {{was still}} continuing {{to go into the}} office three days per week during the early 1950s. He did not formally retire until 1958, but <b>even</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> visited occasionally. Margaret Holden died in 1954 after a protracted illness which had left her nearly blind since the mid-1940s. In the last decade of his life, Holden was himself physically weaker and was looked after by his niece Minnie Green.|$|E
5|$|Summerhayes {{hoped that}} Titterton {{would be able}} to enter the University of Cambridge, but the paper mill that his father worked for closed due to the Great Depression, leaving his father {{unemployed}} for a time, and unable to afford it. Instead, in 1934, Titterton was accepted into University of Birmingham on a teacher's scholarship, which paid his tuition fees, board and residence at Chancellor's Hall, a hostel for male undergraduates. Due to his achievements at secondary school, Ernest was allowed to begin his tertiary studies with second-year subjects, and <b>even</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> was said to have found them easy. He obtained his Bachelor of Science in 1936 with distinctions in both pure and applied mathematics and, of course, physics. An honours year quickly followed, and Titterton topped the year in physics. He continued his interest in music, playing the piano at social events. He also played hockey with the university First XI from 1934 to 1936.|$|E
5|$|O'Sullivan {{began the}} 2010/2011 season at Event 1 of the Players Tour Championship, where he lost 0–4 in the quarter-finals against Jamie Cope. O'Sullivan next competed at Event 4, where {{he reached the}} final, but he lost 3–4 against Barry Pinches. At the World Open O'Sullivan made his record 10th maximum break in the last frame of his match against Mark King, which he won 3–0. However, {{he had to be}} persuaded by referee Jan Verhaas to play the final black, as he had become aware that there was no {{distinct}} prize money for a maximum break in the tournament, but only a prize of £4,000 for the highest break. <b>Even</b> <b>then,</b> <b>he</b> played the final black in a nonchalant fashion. O'Sullivan then defeated Jimmy White (3–1), Stephen Hendry (3–1), Stephen Maguire (3–1) and Peter Ebdon (3–1) to reach the final, where he lost 1–5 against Neil Robertson. O'Sullivan participated at the Premier League Snooker, and qualified for the finals unbeaten. He then defeated Neil Robertson 5–1 in the semi-finals, and Shaun Murphy 7–1 in the final, to claim his ninth Premier League Snooker title in 14 years. In the UK Championship in December, O'Sullivan suffered an early exit, losing 6–9 against Stuart Bingham in the first round.|$|E

25|$|On 14 August 1993 Davis turned 80, {{and still}} held a ranking of 259. <b>Even</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> {{stated that he}} would have loved to {{continue}} playing, but was prevented from doing so by the severe arthritis in his left knee which made it painful to walk. Indeed, it was Davis' attempt to redistribute his stance which contributed to such heavy defeats in his final snooker matches.|$|E
25|$|Ashley was insistent {{that the}} course should provide a broad education, with {{students}} not only studying commerce but also languages and modern history. <b>Even</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> recognised {{the importance of the}} international context in which business operated, wanting his graduates to be able to understand the background to the political and economic policies of other countries. Given Britain's position as a colonial power {{at the turn of the}} century, this was a far-sighted approach.|$|E
25|$|From {{this point}} on, Stephens voted with the Democrats. Until after 1855, Stephens {{could not be}} {{properly}} called a Democrat, and <b>even</b> <b>then,</b> <b>he</b> never officially declared it. In this move, Stephens broke irrevocably with many of his former Whig colleagues. When the Whig Party disintegrated after the election of 1852, some Whigs flocked to the short-lived Know-Nothing Party, but Stephens fiercely opposed the Know-Nothings both for their secrecy and their anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic position.|$|E

Although he had eaten little all day, it cost him {{something}} {{of an effort to}} begin his meal.|$|R

The film was directed by Raja Nene for Venus Pictures under the Charolia Productions banner and was produced by A. V. Charolia. Music was composed by Ramchandra Pal with lyrics by Mukhram Sharma Ashant. The cast included Nalini Jaywant, Karan Dewan, Jagdish Sethi, Saroj Borkar, Kusum Deshpandeand Vasant Thengdi.|$|R
25|$|Mansell took fourth from Irvine on lap 10 and six laps later, Irvine {{spun off}} into the wall and retired. It did not take long for Mansell to pass Häkkinen but <b>even</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> was lapping over a second slower than Schumacher and Hill. During the stops, Schumacher and Hill stayed just over a second apart, while, behind, Berger got ahead of Alesi and both got ahead of Barrichello. Soon Berger passed Häkkinen, with Alesi {{following}} him through three laps later.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 1813, he {{left the}} Stadtkonvikt and {{returned}} home for teacher training at the St Anna Normal-hauptschule. In 1814, he entered his father's school as teacher of the youngest pupils. For over two years young Schubert endured such drudgery, dragging himself through it with resounding indifference. There were, however, compensatory interests <b>even</b> <b>then.</b> <b>He</b> continued to take private lessons in composition from Salieri, who gave Schubert more actual technical training {{than any of his}} other teachers, before they parted ways in 1817.|$|E
25|$|Featherston {{continues}} to lose more ground into 1944, losing northern Georgia, and {{large parts of}} South Carolina and Alabama. A coup attempt by Nathan Bedford Forrest III shakes his confidence in his men, and he begins to lose his grip on reality. <b>Even</b> <b>then,</b> <b>he</b> believes {{that he will be}} able to get his way through the use of superbombs, a technology he had poured everything he could into upon realizing the war would not be short. Shortly after Germany uses the first superbomb in warfare against Petrograd, the only Confederate superbomb is set off in Philadelphia, by General Potter. However, the bomb detonates on the outskirts of the city west of the Schuylkill River and doesn't affect any US Government buildings.|$|E
5000|$|Procan is an ancient, primal god. He is {{wild and}} tempestuous; {{he can be}} benevolent or malevolent at turns, but {{generally}} cares nothing for humanity unless carefully propitiated - and perhaps not <b>even</b> <b>then.</b> <b>He's</b> the embodiment of mercurial winds and uncertain fate. He is greedy and possessive of the wealth that comes to his domain, whether from deliberate offerings or sunken ships. He's an elder god, almost like a titan, though he roams the cosmos freely.|$|R

25|$|Shaftesbury {{was nearly}} forty before he married, and <b>even</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> {{appears to have}} taken this step at the urgent {{instigation}} of his friends, mainly to supply a successor to the title. The object of his choice (or rather of his second choice, for an earlier project of marriage had shortly before fallen through) was Jane Ewer, {{the daughter of a}} Hertfordshire gentleman. The marriage took place in the autumn of 1709, and on 9 February 1711, was born at his house at Reigate, in Surrey, his only child and heir, the fourth Earl, to whose manuscript accounts we are in great part indebted for the details of his father's life. The match appears to have been happy, though Shaftesbury had little sentiment on the subject of married life.|$|E
25|$|In {{the later}} novels, the only crime {{which he can}} be seen to commit might be illegal entry, when he and Paul Drake are searching for evidence. And <b>even</b> <b>then,</b> <b>he</b> would expect to put up a strong and {{effective}} defense leading to an acquittal. Hamilton Burger is constantly under the impression that Mason has done something illegal, but is never able to prove it. Gardner prefaced many of his later novels with tributes to coroners and forensic pathologists whose work was instrumental to solving cases. Gardner inserts his ideas about the importance of proper autopsies into many of his Mason novels. In The Case of the Fugitive Nurse, for instance, close scrutiny of dental records in the identification of burned bodies is a key point. In that same story, the possible use of additives to track illegal resale of medical narcotics is examined.|$|E
25|$|Russ Meyer {{was born}} in San Leandro, California, the son of Lydia Lucinda (Hauck) and William Arthur Meyer, an Oakland police officer. His parents were both of German descent. Meyer's parents {{divorced}} soon after he was born, and Meyer was to have virtually no contact with his father during his life. When he was 14 years old, his mother pawned her wedding ring in order to buy him an 8mm film camera. He {{made a number of}} amateur films at the age of 15, and served during World War II as a U.S. Army combat cameraman for the 166th Signal Photo Company. <b>Even</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> already demonstrated a corny directing style and included nudity, like in scenes of naked GIs bathing in the Rhine in March 1945. In the Army, Meyer forged his strongest friendships, and he would later ask many of his fellow combat cameramen to work on his films. Much of Meyer's work during World War II can be seen in newsreels and in the film Patton (1971). On his return to civilian life, he was unable to secure cinematography work in Hollywood {{due to a lack of}} industry connections. He made industrial films, freelanced as a still photographer for mainstream films (he did the still photography for Giant), and became a well known glamour photographer whose work included some of the initial shoots for Hugh Hefner's Playboy magazine. Meyer would go on to shoot three Playboy centerfolds during the magazine's early years, one of his wife Eve Meyer in 1955. He also shot a pictorial of then-wife Edy Williams in March 1973.|$|E

500|$|Lex also {{develops}} a craving for power, with that hunger expanding in season five. Al Gough believes that Lex's political motivations {{are based on}} his lust for power. Rosenbaum echoes that opinion, believing that Lex can never get enough; [...] "Lex is an insatiable character". Rosenbaum believes that nothing will satisfy Lex's hunger, {{and that he will}} keep going until he is president of the United States. <b>Even</b> <b>then,</b> <b>he</b> will keep trying to make the majority of people like and believe in him.|$|E
500|$|This was {{the first}} ever {{national}} championship in any sport for the University of Cincinnati. He and teammate Roy Lagaly become the first-ever Bearcats to be named All-Americans. Keating was an imposing 6 feet 5inches, a natural leader and co-captain of the team with Lagaly. Of Keating, Lagaly said, [...] "You could tell <b>even</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> {{was going to be}} very successful. He was very ambitious. Whatever he did, he did all the way." [...] Keating followed this by swimming for Cincinnati Gym, finishing second to future Olympic gold medalist Joseph Verdeur in the 220-yard breaststroke at the April 1946 national AAU championships.|$|E
500|$|Acting {{gradually}} became {{a passion for}} Hoffman: [...] "I loved the camaraderie of it, the people, and that's when I decided it was what I wanted to do." [...] At the age of 17, he was selected to attend the 1984 New York State Summer School of the Arts in Saratoga Springs, where he met his future collaborators Bennett Miller and Dan Futterman. Miller later commented on Hoffman's popularity at the time: [...] "We were attracted {{to the fact that}} he was genuinely serious about what he was doing. <b>Even</b> <b>then,</b> <b>he</b> was passionate." [...] Hoffman applied for several drama degree programs and was accepted to New York University's (NYU) Tisch School of the Arts. Between starting on the program and graduating from Fairport High School, he continued his training at the Circle in the Square Theatre's summer program. Hoffman had positive memories of his time at NYU, where he supported himself by working as an usher. With friends, he co-founded the Bullstoi Ensemble acting troupe. He received a drama degree in 1989.|$|E

While using binoculars they see Hotchkiss wearing his combat boots and camouflage marine field jacket departing the house with other smugglers, including the Mexican smuggler who was guiding the group that Jeb and Elena had infiltrated. Maynard has found [...] "the Marine".

You haven't got sense enough to see him right {{if you had a}} chance. Neither has Blome. The only {{way to get rid of}} Steele is for the gang to draw on him, all at once.

500|$|One of the conspirators, Thomas Percy, was {{promoted}} in June 1604, {{gaining access to}} a house in London that belonged to John Whynniard, Keeper of the King's Wardrobe. [...] Fawkes was installed as a caretaker and began using the pseudonym John Johnson, servant to Percy. [...] The contemporaneous account of the prosecution (taken from Thomas Wintour's confession) claimed that the conspirators attempted to dig a tunnel from beneath Whynniard's house to Parliament, although this story {{may have been a}} government fabrication; no evidence for the existence of a tunnel was presented by the prosecution, and no trace of one has ever been found; Fawkes himself did not admit the existence of such a scheme until his fifth interrogation, but <b>even</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> could not locate the tunnel. [...] If the story is true, however, by December 1604 the conspirators were busy tunnelling from their rented house to the House of Lords. [...] They ceased their efforts when, during tunnelling, they heard a noise from above. [...] Fawkes was sent out to investigate, and returned with the news that the tenant's widow was clearing out a nearby undercroft, directly beneath the House of Lords.|$|E
500|$|As {{commander}} and ruler in Egypt, al-Ikhshid was a patient and cautious man. He achieved his goals {{as much by}} diplomacy and ties to powerful personages in the Baghdad regime as by force, and <b>even</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> tended to avoid direct military confrontation whenever possible. His conflict with Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh was indicative of his approach: instead of a direct clash, the truce between the two gave al-Ikhshid the time to reconnoitre the situation in Egypt before acting. Although {{following in the footsteps}} of Ibn Tulun, his ambitions were more modest and his objectives more practical, as became particularly evident in his policies towards Syria and the rest of the Caliphate. Historically, possession of Syria, and particularly Palestine, was a foreign policy objective for many rulers of Egypt, to foreclose the most likely invasion route into the country. Ibn Tulun before and Saladin after al-Ikhshid were two typical examples of Egyptian rulers who spent much of their reigns securing control of Syria, and indeed used Egypt mostly as a source of revenue and resources to accomplish this goal. Al-Ikhshid differed from them; Bacharach describes him as a [...] "cautious, conservative realist". His goals were limited but clear: his main concern was Egypt proper and the establishment of his family as a hereditary dynasty over it, while Syria remained a secondary objective. Unlike other military strongmen of the time, he had no intention of entering the contest for control of Baghdad and the caliphal government through the all-powerful office of amir al-umara; indeed, when Caliph al-Mustakfi (r. 944–946) offered him the post, he turned it down.|$|E
2500|$|When pestilence {{swept through}} the whole known world and notably the Roman Empire, wiping {{out most of the}} farming {{community}} and of necessity leaving a trail of desolation in its wake, Justinian showed no mercy towards the ruined freeholders. <b>Even</b> <b>then,</b> <b>he</b> did not refrain from demanding the annual tax, not only the amount at which he assessed each individual, but also the amount for which his deceased neighbors were liable.|$|E
60|$|George {{snatched}} it up, and rushed downstairs. In the sitting-room, all {{was dark and}} silent: there was no fire, no breakfast.

The door was not even unbolted. George anathematized Mrs. G. for a lazy old woman, and thought it was very strange that people could not get up at a decent, respectable time, unlocked and unbolted the door, and ran out.|$|R
