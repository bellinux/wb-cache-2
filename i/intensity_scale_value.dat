40|$|Abstract-We {{consider}} “scale ” {{a physical}} attribute of a signal and develop its properties. We present an operator which represents scale and study its characteristics and representation. This {{allows one to}} define the scale transform and the energy scale density spectrum which {{is an indication of}} the <b>intensity</b> of <b>scale</b> <b>values</b> in a signal. We obtain explicit expressions for the mean scale, scale bandwidth, instantaneous scale, and scale group delay. Furthermore, we derive expressions for mean time, mean frequency, duration, frequency bandwidth in terms of the scale variable. The short-time transform is defined and used to obtain the conditional <b>value</b> of <b>scale</b> for a given time. We show that as the windows narrows one obtains instantaneous scale. Convolution and correlation theorems for scale are derived. A formulation is devised for studying linear scale-invariant systems. We derive joint representations of time-scale and frequency-scale. General classes for each are presented using the same methodology as for the time-frequency case. As special cases the joint distributions of Marinovich-Altes and Bertrand-Bertrand are recovered. Also, joint representations of the three quantities, time-frequency-scale are devised. A general expression for the local scale autocorrelation function is given. Uncertainty principles for scale and time and scale and frequency are derived. I...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a partial volume correction technique that applies a measurement weighting based on grey <b>scale</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>values,</b> allowing crack opening displacements (CODs) {{to be better}} estimated in micro-focus computed tomography (?CT) scans. These were tested on 3 D data obtained from two separate ?CT scanners on particle toughened and non-particle toughened carbon fibre material subjected to low velocity impact. Direct comparisons of COD estimations were made with higher resolution measurements obtained using synchrotron radiation computed tomography (SRCT) scans taken at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). In this study, partial volume correction is reported to improve the accuracy of these measurements to within 20 % of SRCT measurements, whereas measurements based on counting interconnected voxels representing a detectable crack are reported to consistently overestimate crack openings by up to 500 %. Scatter in estimations was dependent on material type, noise, and artefacts associated with ?CT volumes...|$|R

30|$|The seismic <b>intensity</b> <b>scale</b> used in Japan is {{the scale}} of the Japan Meteorological Agency (hereafter, {{referred}} to as the JMA). This seismic intensity is measured from instrumentally-recorded ground motion data (JMA, 1996). Meanwhile, the seismic <b>intensity</b> <b>scale</b> of JMA from 1949 to 1996 had been determined from the damage situation of structures and the other information (JMA, 1996). At that time, a seismic <b>intensity</b> <b>scale</b> having 8 degrees from 0 to 7 was applied. This seismic <b>intensity</b> <b>scale</b> of 7 corresponds to the destructive ground motion that causes the higher ratio of collapsed houses.

The {{aim of this study}} was to translate, retranslate and validate the PONV <b>Intensity</b> <b>Scale</b> for use in Portuguese Post Anesthetic Care Unit (PACU) settings. MethodsThe PONV <b>Intensity</b> <b>Scale</b> was translated and back-translated in accordance with available guidelines. The research team conducted an observational and cohort prospective study in a PACU. One-hundred ﬁfty-seven adult patients admiited after surgery over three weeks were evaluated for PONV. Measurements included nausea visual analogic scale (VAS) at 6 and 24 hours, postoperatively. We assessed reliability and observer disagreement using interclass correlation (ICC) and Information-Based Measure of Disagreement (IBMD). We compared VAS scores between patients with clinically signiﬁcant (≥ 50) and not signiﬁcant (< 50) PONV. ResultsThirty-nine patients (25 %) had PONV at 6 hours and 54 (34 %) had PONV at 24 hours. Thirty-six and 54 patients experienced nausea at 6 and 24 hours, respectively. Among patients with PONV, 6 patients (15 %) and 9 patients (27 %) had a clinically signiﬁcant PONV <b>intensity</b> <b>scale</b> score at 6 and at 24 hours, respectively. The reliability was good both for PONV <b>intensity</b> <b>scale</b> score and for VAS and observer disagreement was slightly higher for VAS. The median nausea VAS scores were higher in patients with clinically signiﬁcant PONV Intensity score.

40|$|A {{parametric}} {{study on}} the scaling of natural accelerograms using spectrum <b>intensity</b> <b>scales</b> is presented. A series of nonlinear time-history analyses for a SDOF system is conducted using an ensemble of world-wide damaging earthquake records {{for a wide range}} of seismic conditions. Structural parameters considered in the study include: yield seismic coefficient, yield natural period and postyield stiffness. The effectiveness of several spectrum <b>intensity</b> <b>scales</b> is evaluated in terms of their correlation with displacement ductility demand. Results indicate that there is not a unique scale with best performance over the entire range of strength and stiffness. An alternative combined criterion to define spectrum intensity is proposed in terms of a system of spectrum <b>intensity</b> <b>scales.</b> The system optimises the correlation between spectrum intensity and displacement ductility demand. This is achieved by defining regions in the space of structural parameters for which it is possible to identify a spectrum <b>intensity</b> <b>scale</b> of best performance...|$|R
