40|$|Ranch-reared mink (Mustela vison) {{were used}} as a model in an {{experimental}} trial to investigate the potential effects of exposure to two petroleum products on sea otters (Enhydra lutris). Mink were exposed either dermally on one occasion 60 days prior to breeding or via low level contamination of their diets daily from 60 days prior to breeding (January 1994) until weaning of kits (June 1994). For dermal exposure, we placed mink in either a slick of Alaskan North Slope crude <b>oil</b> (<b>n</b> = 24) or bunker C <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> (<b>n</b> = 24) on sea water or sea water alone (n = 10) for 1 min. For dietary exposure, we fed mink rations containing 500 ppm of either Alaskan North Slope crude <b>oil</b> (<b>n</b> = 24) or bunker C <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> (<b>n</b> = 24; control, n = 15). The number of liveborn kits {{did not differ significantly}} among mink exposed dermally (5. 0 kits/female for crude oil and 6. 5 kits/female for bunker C <b>fuel</b> <b>oil)</b> and unexposed controls (5. 3 kits/female). However, only 2. 3 and 0. 7 kits were produced per female for those exposed through the diet to crude oil and bunker C <b>fuel</b> <b>oil,</b> respectively. Females with reduced reproductive success had no clinical signs of toxicosis or behavioral abnormalities. In addition, kits of females exposed through the diet had poor survival to weaning. Once mature, kits born to females exposed to bunker C <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> in the diet had significantly reduced reproductive success (3. 4 kits/female) although their only exposure to the petroleum products was in utero or during nursing. Therefore, it is possible that sea otter populations consuming contaminated food sources or colonizing previously oiled habitats will have reduced reproductive success.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Eighteen pe t ro leum systems (PS) - {{particular}} {{combinations of}} source rock maturation and migration to reservoirs in a confined {{area of a}} sedimentary province- {{have been identified in}} Romania. Most hydrocarbons w e r e expelled or re-migrated into t he reservoirs after the Late Styrian orogenic phase, 12 - 14 Ma years ago. Hydrocarbons mostly accumulated in fields during the Late Sarmatian-Pliocene interval, after the Moldavian orogenic phase. Most gas in the Sarmatian-Pliocene reservoirs of the post-tectonic basins is biogenic. The thick Late Miocene-Pl iocene sediments of the Carpathian foredeep and Transylvania Basin have not reached the stage of an effective thermogenic pe t ro leum system.

The Australian Customs and the Australian Tax Office define a bunker fuel as the fuel that powers the engine of a ship or aircraft. Bunker A is No. 2 <b>fuel</b> <b>oil,</b> bunker B is No. 4 or No. 5 and bunker C is No. 6. Since No. 6 is the most common, [...] "bunker fuel" [...] is often used as a synonym for No. 6.

40|$|The {{bunkering}} industry {{provides the}} shipping industry with the <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> that the vessels consume. The {{quality of the}} <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> provided will ensure the safe operation of vessels. Shipping companies under their <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> management programme confirm that {{the quality and quantity}} of <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> provided are as requested. To be certain of the quality and quantity loaded, correctly performed bunkering procedures need to be integrated in the <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> management programme. The data collected through them will prove more than useful when a dispute arises either in terms of <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> quality or the loaded quantity. Ship emissions to air are a concern of IMO and recently the European Union, as the shipping industry contrary to land-based industries is not yet subject to any regulations to reduce emissions. Sulphur oxides are targeted as they depend on the sulphur content of the <b>fuel</b> <b>oil.</b> Identical limits are set by both the IMO and the EU, but IMO's regulations are yet to be ratified and EU will not accept any vessels travelling within its waters to bum high-sulphur <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> from 2010 onwards. Till then, those involved in the matter might have to consider implementing an emissions trading scheme, as in the land-based industries, as a more viable option to capping sulphur content. Every shipowner is aware of the fact that the single most costly and highly volatile running cost paid is the cost of bunkers. The options available to him/her are hedging instruments such as futures and OTC products. When used effectively along with freight futures, although not yet commonly available, shipping companies may reduce their risk exposure and enhance their profits. (cont.)
