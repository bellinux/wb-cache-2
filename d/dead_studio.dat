500|$|Given the {{commercial}} success of The Evil <b>Dead,</b> <b>studio</b> financial backing {{for the new}} project came quickly. Though Raimi and Campbell did not profit from the film, the studio believed in Raimi, initially allowing the director complete creative control on the project; however, executives later {{took control of the}} production. Raimi and Campbell developed the project with Embassy Pictures' producer Norman Lear, who supposedly had a [...] "Midas touch", because of the consistent success he had attained from various television productions. He suggested the title Crimewave, which was ultimately used.|$|E

5000|$|During {{this same}} period, Dawson {{continued}} {{to appear as}} a guest musician on Grateful <b>Dead</b> <b>studio</b> albums, including Workingman's Dead (1970) and American Beauty (1970). [...] With Jerry Garcia and Robert Hunter, he co-wrote the song [...] "Friend of the Devil".|$|E
5000|$|Aoxomoxoa is {{the third}} Grateful <b>Dead</b> <b>studio</b> album. One of the first rock albums to be {{recorded}} using 16-track technology, fans and critics alike consider this era to be the band's experimental apex. The title is a meaningless palindrome, usually pronounced [...] "ox-oh-mox-oh-ah".|$|E
50|$|Workingman's Dead is {{the fourth}} Grateful <b>Dead</b> <b>studio</b> album. It was {{recorded}} in February 1970 and originally released on June 14, 1970. The album and its studio follow-up, American Beauty, were recorded back-to-back using a similar style, eschewing the psychedelic experimentation of previous albums in favor of Jerry Garcia and Robert Hunter's Americana-styled songcraft.|$|E
5000|$|Beyond Description (1973-1989) is {{the second}} twelve-CD box set {{retrospective}} of the Grateful <b>Dead's</b> <b>studio</b> and live albums.

As with The Arista Years, the album contains tracks from Terrapin Station, Shakedown Street, Go to Heaven, In the Dark, and Built to Last, and does not contain any new or expanded recordings.|$|R
50|$|The Arista Years is a {{compilation}} album that chronicles the Grateful <b>Dead's</b> <b>studio</b> and live albums during their time with Arista Records.

It contains tracks from Terrapin Station, Shakedown Street, Go to Heaven, Reckoning, Dead Set, In the Dark, Built to Last, and Without a Net. The set does not contain any new or expanded recordings. A media outlet sampler, Selections from the Arista Years, was released by Arista in January 1997.|$|R
50|$|Garcia had band {{sound man}} Dan Healy {{set up a}} low wattage radio {{transmitter}} so he could drive around the neighborhood and listen to how the production would sound on a car radio. Go to Heaven {{would be the last}} Grateful <b>Dead</b> <b>studio</b> album for seven years, though there was an aborted attempt four years later.|$|E
50|$|Go to Heaven is {{a studio}} album by rock band the Grateful Dead, {{released}} April 28, 1980 on Arista Records. It is the band's first album with keyboardist Brent Mydland. Go to Heaven was both the third Grateful <b>Dead</b> <b>studio</b> album {{in a row}} and the last for over seven years. It was also the third in a row, and the last, to use an outside producer (Gary Lyons).|$|E

5000|$|Eight of {{the tracks}} are from <b>Dead</b> <b>studio</b> recordings, and two are from live albums. However [...] "Turn On Your Love Light" [...] is an edited version, that first {{appeared}} on the Warner/Reprise Loss Leaders album The Big Ball, rather than the complete version from Live/Dead. [...] "One More Saturday Night" [...] is a live version from Europe '72. Though [...] "Mexicali Blues" [...] is from Weir's solo album, he is backed by the Grateful Dead. Nothing is presented from previous albums Anthem of the Sun, Grateful Dead or Bear's Choice, nor versions from singles.|$|E
5000|$|In 2013 the Grateful <b>Dead</b> <b>studio</b> albums were remastered {{again for}} {{listening}} in digital high resolution. The 2013 download {{is the first}} digital issue of the Anthem of the Sun early 70s remix. Confusingly, the promotion for this reissue emphasized the use of original mixes (particularly those of the Workingman's Dead and American Beauty albums which had been remixed for previous high resolution digital releases). [...] However, Anthem of the Sun and Aoxomoxoa appear in the 2013 HD release not in their original mixes, but in remixed form, as released in 1972.|$|E
5000|$|American Beauty was {{the result}} of a {{prolific}} period of the songwriting partnership of Jerry Garcia and Robert Hunter - one that yielded two studio albums in one year for the Grateful Dead. This was the only time the band would return to the studio so quickly. However, unlike the previous effort, where almost all the songs were written solely by the pair, the album saw more input from the rest of the band. Included are Phil Lesh's [...] "Box of Rain" [...] and Bob Weir's [...] "Sugar Magnolia", both written with Hunter, and [...] "Operator", Ron [...] "Pigpen" [...] McKernan's only singing-songwriting effort on a Grateful <b>Dead</b> <b>studio</b> album.|$|E

50|$|Company of Justice was Play <b>Dead's</b> final <b>studio</b> album. After {{a series}} of signing with {{multiple}} flopping independent record labels, Play Dead created their own record label called Tanz in early 1985 just {{after the end of}} the From the Promised Land tour.|$|R

The actual <b>Dead</b> recording <b>studio</b> remains operational until late 2007, with surviving band members and other area musicians rolling though the facilities.|$|R
50|$|Many bootleg {{recordings}} {{are available}} of the group. Among them are {{a wealth of}} shows from March 1967 at the Matrix Club in San Francisco. Many shows are available from 1968 when the band reached the height of its popularity, notably two shows in Stockholm, Sweden. The infamous Miami show has become widely available while many 1970 shows, notably a radio broadcast of the June 5 Seattle and June 6 Vancouver show, make the rounds. The complete 1969 Rock Is <b>Dead</b> <b>studio</b> jam was discovered in the mid-1990s. In Rock is Dead and in interviews Morrison {{makes it clear that}} the music is a continued exploration of the Dionysian mythic content that had informed his earlier poetry. The apocalyptic elements in the music and the poetry were ahead of the music of the day; later groups like Nirvana are influenced by the Doors.|$|E
5000|$|The Grateful Dead {{returned}} to the studio {{at the end of}} March 1974, having readied another batch of songs. The majority were again composed by lead guitarist Jerry Garcia and lyricist Robert Hunter and featured Garcia's lead vocals. However, [...] "Pride of Cucamonga" [...] and [...] "Unbroken Chain" [...] were both written and sung by bassist Phil Lesh with the assistance of poet Bobby Petersen. This was the only time he would sing two songs on a <b>Dead</b> <b>studio</b> album, and they would be his final lead vocal work for the band until 1985. Rhythm guitarist Bob Weir contributed [...] "Money Money" [...] with writing partner John Perry Barlow. The band chose to return to the previous Coast Recorders on Folsom Street in San Francisco, where they had recorded [...] "The Golden Road (To Unlimited Devotion)" [...] as a single for their first album, in 1967. The studio had since been purchased by CBS Studios and refurbished. They produced the album themselves with engineer Roy Segal. According to Segal, Garcia liked the room because it had a more [...] "live" [...] sound than the Record Plant, where the band had recorded their previous album. Garcia had played in CBS Studios earlier in the year with Art Garfunkel during the sessions for Angel Clare.|$|E
5000|$|Drummer-percussionist Mickey Hart had {{a greater}} {{influence}} than previously, earning three co-compositional credits in addition to assisting with the arrangements of several songs, including Garcia and Hunter's title track (influenced by {{his interest in the}} Bee Gees and disco). As with the previous album's [...] "Terrapin Flyer", Hart and Kreutzmann wrote a percussion-based instrumental track ("Serengetti"), recording it at the compound of medicine man Rolling Thunder, in Nevada. Hart's reggae-informed [...] "Fire on the Mountain", with lyrics by Garcia's writing partner Robert Hunter, evolved from [...] "Happiness is Drumming", which appeared on his Diga Rhythm Band's 1976 album. Although an attempt to record the song for Terrapin Station proved to be unsuccessful, it rapidly evolved into one of the band's principal jamming vehicles (often paired with Garcia's [...] "Scarlet Begonias") during their spring 1977 tour. Hart and Hunter's [...] "France" [...] was sung by Donna Godchaux and rhythm guitarist Bob Weir, who devised a simpler arrangement and earned a compositional credit. Donna made her second, and final, singing-songwriting performance on a <b>Dead</b> <b>studio</b> album with [...] "From the Heart of Me". (In between her two contributions, she also wrote and sang [...] "Rain" [...] for Garcia's Cats Under the Stars). Her background as a gospel-soul session singer at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio is evident in her vocal delivery.|$|E

The first disagreement between the director and the executives stemmed from the latter's insistence on casting a [...] "Hollywood" [...] actor in the lead role instead of Raimi's long-time collaborator and friend Campbell. In his 2002 autobiography If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor, Campbell commented about how difficult it was working with more established producers; [...] "jumping into the big time meant dealing with the excruciatingly specific and alternately vague demands of a studio, ... Hollywood executives took an interest in everything." [...] Campbell was surprised that he had to audition for the lead role, as {{he did not have to}} test for The Evil Dead. [...] Campbell and his photographer friend Mike Ditz used a 16 mm film camera and shot a scene to show to the producers. Upon viewing it, the producers asserted that [...] "Campbell will not star in this film". [...] In retaliation, Raimi lengthened a supporting role and gave it to Campbell: the character of Renaldo [...] "The Heel". This allowed for Campbell to be present through the production.|$|E
