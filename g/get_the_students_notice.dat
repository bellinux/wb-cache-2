30|$|Rather {{than simply}} lecturing to <b>the</b> <b>student,</b> <b>the</b> tutor {{provides}} scaffolding for <b>the</b> <b>student</b> to articulate <b>the</b> expectations {{through a number}} of dialog moves. A pump is a generic expression to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> to provide more information, such as “What else?” or “Tell me more.” Hints and prompts are selected by <b>the</b> tutor to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> to articulate missing content words, phrases, and propositions. A hint tries to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> to express a lengthy constituent (e.g., proposition, clause, sentence), whereas a prompt is a question that tries to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> to express a single word or phrase. The tutor generates an assertion if <b>the</b> <b>student</b> fails to express the expectation after multiple hints and prompts. AutoTutor provides a cycle of pump → hint → prompt → assertion for each expectation until the expectation is covered. As <b>the</b> <b>student</b> and tutor express information over many turns, the list of expectations is eventually covered and the main task is completed.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{primary and}} {{necessary}} task for any undergraduate student {{has to go}} through after his orientation is advising. Advising {{plays a key role in}} a student’s success towards his degree program. Many reports were published recently on the survey of the declining college graduate students [2]. There might be several reasons behind this, but the major drawback of this decline is due to the improper advising of <b>the</b> <b>students.</b> <b>Noticing</b> <b>the</b> importance of the advising system, an Intelligent Advising System is designed which helps <b>the</b> <b>students</b> prepare their degree plan by selecting their major and minor/s.
