[...] Matheny stated, [...] "We tell all our young pitchers when they come up to pitch their game. [...] Yadi needs to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> work. [...] He's a quick study. [...] But at the same time, they tend to just follow him. [...] We do put them in Yadi's hands." [...] Molina reads opposing hitters and will move fielders with subtle signs and gestures to align them with his pitch calling. [...] La Russa commented that [...] "it's not just instinct. [...] It's sense, based on how a hitter's standing, how he responds to the pitch or two before, and he's very creative in how he makes his adjustment based on what he sees with the hitter and knowing what his pitcher can do." ...|$|E

40|$|Courtship plot is {{regarded}} as one of the important characteristics in English novels, for numerous English novels have dealt with marriage in various ways for centuries. Especially in the nineteenth century, novels became very popular and the trend was accelerated. On the other hand, children are educated at home by their parents and read what their parents choose. This means that those books reflect how their parents would like them to act. This essay focuses on writing for children in the nineteenth century and shows both how the masculine gender infiltrated into boys and how the feminine gender into girls, so that their consciousness on gender is deeply connected with courtship plot. This essay deals with children 2 ̆ 7 s literature and periodicals published both for boys and girls, and <b>finds</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> teach their gender and offer not realistic but individualistic marriage...|$|R

60|$|For seamen {{have been}} forced, {{by the nature}} of their calling, to be {{scientific}} men. From the very earliest ages in which the first canoe put out to sea, the mariner has been educated by the most practical of all schoolmasters, namely, danger. He has carried his life in his hand day and night; he has had to battle with the most formidable and the most seemingly capricious of the brute powers of nature; with storms, with ice, with currents, with unknown rocks and shoals, with the vicissitudes of climate, and the terrible and seemingly miraculous diseases which change of climate engenders. He has had to fight Nature; and to conquer her, if he could, by understanding her; by observing facts, and by facing facts. He dared not, like a scholar in his study, indulge in theories and fancies about how things ought to be. He had to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> really were. He dared not say, According to my theory of the universe this current ought to run in such a direction; he had to find out which way it did actually run, according to God's method of the universe, lest it should run him ashore. Everywhere, I say, and all day long, the seaman has to observe facts and to use facts, unless he intends to be drowned; and therefore, so far from being a superstitious man, who refuses to inquire into facts, but puts vain dreams in their stead, the sailor is for the most part a very scientific-minded man: observant, patient, accurate, truthful; conquering Nature, as the great saying is, because he obeys her.|$|E
60|$|To follow impetuous, bird-like Rima in her {{descent of}} the hill would have been impossible, nor had I any {{desire to be a}} witness of old Nuflo's discomfiture at the finish. It was better to leave them to settle their quarrel themselves, while I {{occupied}} myself in turning over these fresh facts in my mind to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> fitted into the speculative structure I had been building during {{the last two or three}} weeks. But it soon struck me that it was getting late, that the sun would be gone in a couple of hours; and at once I began the descent. It was not accomplished without some bruises and a good many scratches. After a cold draught, obtained by putting my lips to a black rock from which the water was trickling, I set out on my walk home, keeping near the western border of the forest for fear of losing myself. I had covered about half the distance from the foot {{of the hill}} to Nuflo's lodge when the sun went down. Away on my left the evening uproar of the howling monkeys burst out, and after three or four minutes ceased; the after silence was pierced at intervals by screams of birds going to roost among the trees in the distance, and by many minor sounds close at hand, of small bird, frog, and insect. The western sky was now like amber-coloured flame, and against that immeasurably distant luminous background the near branches and clustered foliage looked black; but on my left hand the vegetation still appeared of a uniform dusky green. In a little while night would drown all colour, and there would be no light but that of the wandering lantern-fly, always unwelcome to the belated walker in a lonely place, since, like the ignis fatuus, it is confusing to the sight and sense of direction.|$|E
