5|$|Coprinopsis atramentaria, {{commonly}} known as the common ink cap or inky cap, is an edible (but sometimes poisonous, when combined with alcohol) mushroom found <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>North</b> America.

It can be eaten but is poisonous when consumed with alcohol – hence another common name, tippler's bane.|$|E
