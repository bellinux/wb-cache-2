40|$|IIn December of 2006, TPI {{responded to}} two RFP's from NIOSH seeking {{technical}} proposals {{to design and}} build novel respirators {{for use in the}} mining industry. One RFP sought a dockable, self-contained, self-rescuer (SCSR) to allow for extended respiratory protection during mine escape, and the other was for a <b>hybrid</b> <b>mine</b> escape respirator incorporating both air-purifying, and self-contained types of respirators, also for the purpose of extending the time available for escaping miners to receive respiratory protection. TPI recognized a commonality in the two RFPs and responded to both with designs that could be produced independently, but which shared several fundamental features. In evaluating TPI's responses to the RFPs, NIOSH recognized a benefit in the shared design features and awarded one contract for TPI to pursue both concepts resulting in one conceptual product referred to as the dockable/hybrid SCSR. This SCSR would be configured to allow any suitably equipped breathing device (CO Filter Self Rescuer or another SCSR) to connect (dock) to the base unit and to allow the user to switch between them without 'breaking seal. ' This dockable unit would retain the capacity to accept multiple changes of O 2 supply or filters over an extended period as the useful life of any individual add-on unit is expended. As the project developed it resulted {{in the development of a}} new carbon monoxide (CO) Filtered Self-Rescuer (FSR) to dock to the SCSR and a small electronic sensor, the Breathing Air Monitor (BAM), to alert the user to certain hazards in the local ambient air: Self Contained Self Rescuer (SCSR). The TPI SCSR is a 60 -min compressed O 2 rebreather that protects the user from all adverse breathing conditions. TPI uses Micropore's Lithium Hydroxide (LiOH) catalyst to absorb the retained CO 2. TPI's SCSR is supplied with a docking valve that allows users to change out nearly spent devices with fresh devices without breaking seal or having to hold their breath. Carbon Monoxide Filter Self-Rescuer (CO FSR). TPI also developed, via a supply agreement with 3 M Company, a carbon monoxide (CO) Filtered Self-Rescuer (FSR) that uses a proprietary precious metal catalyst providing 8 hours of protection. TPI's CO FSR can be supplied with a flanged fitting that docks to TPM's SCSR or it can be supplied with a mouthbit for use as a self-contained device for CO protection alone. Breathing Air Monitor (BAM). Finally TPI developed, in cooperation with the Kohler-Bright Star Company, a Breathing Air Monitor (BAM) that would give the user an indication of when it is necessary to use the SCSR because of an oxygen deficient environment and when it safe to use just the CO filter (normal O 2 but high CO) or if is safe to not use either. This warning system will avoid the user expending the breathing device unnecessarily (e. g. the atmosphere is still breathable). The resultant technology is a module containing the sensors, electronics, PC board and alarms that fits on the miner's cap lamp battery, between the body and top cap. By the end of this contract TPI had demonstrated prototypes of all three products. The project did not result in certified devices by the completion of the contract but TPI has negotiated licensing agreements for these three products and they are being prepared for certification submission by the licensee.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, heart disease {{has been the}} leading cause of death all over the world. However, it is among the most {{preventable}} and controllable diseases. The World Health Organization reported that early detection of heart disease reduces progression to severe and costly illness and complications. Early detection of heart disease patients helps in recovering the patientsâ health and decreasing the mortality rate from heart disease. Although heart disease can be detected by several tests, such as electrocardiogram, stress tests, and cardiac angiogram, these tests are expensive and cannot be used as community-level screening tests. The Framingham Heart Disease Risk Evaluation Tool and the Australian Absolute Cardiovascular Risk Calculator are two common heart disease risk evaluation screening tests. However, both tests need prior blood sample investigations, an invasive and relatively costly process, which reduces their usability in other than medical settings. Motivated by the increasing mortality rates of heart disease patients, researchers have been applying different data mining techniques in the diagnosis of heart disease. Research finds that the same data mining technique shows different results across different heart disease datasets indicating that there can be significant attributes for heart disease diagnosis. Furthermore, researchers suggest that <b>hybrid</b> data <b>mining</b> techniques show better performance in the diagnosis of heart disease patients. This research seeks to help healthcare professionals in the early detection and risk evaluation of heart disease patients using data mining analysis. To achieve this objective, the significant attributes in the diagnosis of heart disease patients are identified using a benchmark dataset and a new larger dataset, the reliability of non-invasive attributes in the diagnosis of heart disease is investigated, the enhancement of applying <b>hybrid</b> data <b>mining</b> model to the non-invasive attributes is tested, and a heart disease expert system risk evaluation tool (HD - ESRET) using <b>hybrid</b> data <b>mining</b> model on non-invasive data attributes is constructed.

Many studies used data mining techniques in health environment to perform analysis [8, 9, 25].

Both DT and NB classifiers are useful, efficient and commonly used for solving classification problems in data mining. Since the presence of noisy contradictory instances in the training set may cause the generated decision tree suffers from overfitting and its accuracy may decrease, in our first proposed hybrid DT algorithm, we employ a naïve Bayes (NB) classifier to remove the noisy troublesome instances from the training set before the DT induction. Moreover, it is extremely computationally expensive for a NB classifier to compute class conditional independence for a dataset with high dimensional attributes. Thus, in the second proposed hybrid NB classifier, we employ a DT induction to select a comparatively more important subset of attributes {{for the production of}} naïve assumption of class conditional independence. We tested the performances of the two proposed hybrid algorithms against those of the existing DT and NB classifiers respectively using the classification accuracy, precision, sensitivity-specificity analysis, and 10 -fold cross validation on 10 real benchmark datasets from UCI (University of California, Irvine) machine learning repository.
