40|$|The Dynamic <b>Ergodic</b> <b>Divertor</b> (DED), a {{new concept}} of the <b>ergodic</b> <b>divertor,</b> has been {{presently}} installing for the TEXTOR tokamak. Beside the conventional <b>ergodic</b> <b>divertor</b> operation the DED also permits the operation with a rotating magnetic field which allows, in particular, to broaden the heat deposition pattern on the divertor plates. Since its first proposal of the DED in 1996 the structure of magnetic field, especially, the onset of ergodic zone of field lines and related transport in the DED-operation has been extensively studied using different theoretical and numerical methods. New methods to study the magnetic field, in particular, the field line mapping have been developed. The presentation gives the overview of the studies {{on the structure of}} magnetic field in the DED, the formation of the ergodic and laminar zones of field lines at the plasma edge. It also includes studies on the modelling efforts of the transport of heat and particles in the ergodic and laminar zones...|$|E

40|$|The next {{generation}} of experiments - both for tokamaks and stellarators - requires the development of appropriate theoretical models. One important aspect here is the plasma edge physics description. Fluid transport codes extending beyond the standard 2 -D code packages like B 2 -Eirene or UEDGE are under development. In the case of tokamaks, an interesting alternative line {{is the concept of}} an ergodic edge (necessary e. g. for <b>ergodic</b> <b>divertors</b> in TORE SUPRA or TEXTOR- 94) creating a 3 -D edge structure. To study these effects, a 3 -D code E 3 D based upon a Multiple Coordinate Systems Approach is being developed. Presently, we are extending the program towards stellarator applications. A few new options are made available: single-island geometry and now formulation of boundary conditions. For the new stellarator W 7 -X, a 3 -D finite volume code BoRiS is being developed using magnetic (Boozer) coordinates. In this paper, we present a benchmark of both codes, for a test geometry (one single magnetic island in W 7 -X) including full 3 -D metric variations, solving for the strongly anisotropic electron licat conduction equation...|$|R
40|$|For several decades, {{physicists}} try to {{get under}} laboratory conditions fusion of deuterium and tritium nuclei, with the aim to provide a practically inexhaustible source of energy. The present work is focused onto tokamaks only, which are torus-shaped devices with the magnetic field produced by external coils and electric current in the plasma. This magnetic field restrains the particle motion to a translation along the field lines, and a gyration in a plane perpendicular to them, with a gyro-radius small compared {{to the size of}} the machine. The control of particle and heat transport is a critical issue to obtain the high temperatures and densities required for fusion in future reactors. Collisions between particles lead to transport of both heat and charged particles towards the walls of the tokamak. This transport mechanism is well understood. However, the experimentally observed transport level is much higher than the expected one due to collisions and it is commonly believed that there are additional transport mechanisms. These mechanisms are referred to as anomalous transport and result from microscopic plasma instabilities of different types. <b>Ergodic</b> <b>Divertors</b> (ED) have been introduced in order to provide means to control the transport at the plasma edge. Such devices superpose a small magnetic perturbation from additional coils onto the main magnetic field. Without such perturbations, the magnetic field lines lie on nested toroidal magnetic surfaces. When a perturbation is applied, field lines exhibit small deviations in the direction perpendicular to the unperturbed magnetic surfaces. A sufficiently strong perturbation results in a chaotic behaviour of magnetic field lines, or magnetic field stochastization, allowing transport towards the walls along field lines. In the present work, a model for transport in a stochastic magnetic field [61] is further developed and applied for modelling of plasma behaviour with EDs. This model implies that the transport towards the walls takes place predominantly along the so called ’optimal’ paths. Such paths consist of a succession of segments aligned with the field lines, and segments perpendicular to them. This model provides effective transport coefficients in the [ [...] . ...|$|R

The dependence of the images of visible emission on three magnetic parameters which specify magnetic configurations (the position of the magnetic axis, coil pitch parameter, quadruple magnetic components) is investigated by tracing magnetic field lines. The images of the three-dimensional plots of the magnetic field lines quite agree with the observations in various magnetic configurations.

40|$|Abstract- The {{excitation}} {{threshold of}} the m/n= 2 / 1 tearing mode has been studied by applying the external perturbation field induced by the Dynamic <b>Ergodic</b> <b>Divertor</b> (DED) on TEXTOR. A sudden drop in the threshold dependence on the density has been observed for the first time. Present scalings of the error field mode threshold do not explain the observed behaviour. Introduction- The TEXTOR tokamak is equipped with the Dynamic <b>Ergodic</b> <b>Divertor</b> (DED) which consists of 16 helical coils mounted at the high-field side of the torus. The DED can generate either static or rotating perturbation fields with frequency up to 10 kHz with the funda-mental mode numbers m/n = 12 / 4, 6 / 2 or 3 / 1, here m and n are the poloidal and toroidal mode numbers.

40|$|Experimental {{evidence}} of {{the location of the}} <b>ergodic</b> <b>divertor</b> separatrix is shown to agree with the predicted value given by codes. Variation of this position modifies the divertor tightness, defined as the ratio of the divertor to core density. This effect is governed by laminar transport, i. e., transport proportional to the magnitude of the perturbation. Operation with feedback control of the divertor temperature allows one to optimise the choice of injected impurity species. At 10 eV divertor temperature, nitrogen is shown to lead to the largest decrease in energy flux to the divertor at lowest contribution to Z(eff) Parallel energy fluxes as low as 2 MW m(- 2) are thus achieved on the target plates. For this impurity, radiation is localised in the divertor volume thus leading to radiation compression close to 10. The <b>ergodic</b> <b>divertor</b> appears as a powerful tool to control plasma-wall interaction with no loss of core confinement or plasma current. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|Controlled {{thermonuclear}} fusion offers one possible option {{to meet our}} future energy needs in a sustainable way. Magnetic confinement in a so-called 'tokamak'-machine is a possible approach towards the achievement of a burning plasma. An important issue in this tokamak research is the transition of the plasma edge to the inner wall. A first topic that is addressed in this thesis, is the <b>ergodic</b> <b>divertor</b> (ED) configuration. An ED achieves the transition between the confined plasma and the wall in a layer where the flux lines have been ergodized by a proper resonant magnetic perturbation. The connection between up- and downstream plasma parameters during ED operation in the tokamaks Tore Supra en TEXTOR has been investigated experimentally by means of Langmuir probes. As {{an important first step}} in the theoretical interpretation of those experiments, a Hamiltonian field line mapping code, which had been previously developed for the TEXTOR dynamic <b>ergodic</b> <b>divertor,</b> has been adapted to the geometry of the Tore Supra ED. Subsequently, this adapted code has been used to study some of the properties of the Tore Supra ED magnetic field line structure, as well as to make a qualitative comparison of the sensitivity of the TEXTOR and Tore Supra <b>ergodic</b> <b>divertor</b> magnetic topology to changes in the central density. A second topic of this thesis concerns certain interpretation issues regarding the current-voltage characteristics obtained by a newly developed type of Langmuir probe for the investigation of edge plasmas. More in particular, the sensitivity of the TP to a small population of nonthermal electrons has been investigated in addition to the influence of suprathermal electrons on the scaling and structure of the Debye and the magnetic sheath at the inside of the tunnel probe...|$|E
