5|$|A hunter named Robinson, whose {{cabin was}} at the lake's {{northern}} end about 1800, was the first recorded inhabitant. He gave the lake its earliest known name: Robinson's Lake. However, {{for most of the}} 19th century the lake was known as Long Pond, because of its elongated shape. From 1822 to 1827 the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike, which followed the lake's western shore, was built between the Pennsylvania communities of Berwick in the south and Towanda in the north. Beginning in 1827 the northbound daily stagecoach left Berwick in the morning and stopped <b>for</b> <b>lunch</b> <b>at</b> the Long Pond Tavern on the lake about noon. The stage operated until 1851; the road was the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike until 1908, when the modern Pennsylvania Route 487 was built. Route 487 follows the course of the turnpike as it approaches the lake from the south, then passes to the east of the lake instead.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} World War I, Vanity Fair {{writers and}} Algonquin regulars Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley, and Robert E. Sherwood started meeting <b>for</b> <b>lunch</b> <b>at</b> The Algonquin. Alexander Woollcott, acerbic critic and war correspondent, {{received}} a warm welcome from literary friends in 1919. They gathered in the Rose Room that afternoon; one person enjoyed the event enough to request that it become a daily event. That same request prompted a daily exchange of ideas and opinions shared between highly esteemed literary figures. George S. Kaufman, Heywood Broun, and Edna Ferber were {{also a part of}} this August assembly; these individuals influenced writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway. They founded The New Yorker magazine; all hotel guests receive free copies to this day.|$|E

5000|$|A lengthy 1982 profile by Mark Singer in The New Yorker (reprinted {{in a later}} book by Singer) {{described}} Cohn's {{career and}} personality in detail. Cohn was known <b>for</b> <b>lunching</b> <b>at</b> New York's Russian Tea Room almost every day, his habit of eating paper, and his strong preference for New York over Los Angeles, which is unusual among major motion picture agents. Cohn was also famously difficult to reach on the phone. His obituaries in the two leading entertainment industry trade newspapers both mentioned that he was [...] "the most difficult man in the business {{to get on the}} phone"; and, in his New Yorker profile, Singer repeated an industry joke that Cohn's tombstone would read, [...] "Here lies Sam Cohn.

He made a deal with the investigators, agreeing to cooperate in the investigation of Garson in exchange for a reduced charge (a plea bargain), and the promise of a positive letter from the DA to Siminovsky's sentencing judge. Within hours, he was wearing a hidden body microphone in a sting operation, as he joined Garson <b>for</b> <b>lunch</b> <b>at</b> the Archives Restaurant on Adams Street.

25|$|As day broke, the Tigris Corps {{found itself}} {{advancing}} through a heavy fog. On left bank, Younghusband's brigades began their {{advance in the}} mid-morning. Approximately two hours into the advance, the brigades paused in their movements to break <b>for</b> <b>lunch.</b> <b>At</b> midday, the fog began to clear and turn into an unseasonably hot day. As the British and Indian battalions were cooking their food, the Ottoman forces launched a spoiling attack. Even though it was driven back, the left bank Tigris Corps' attack on the left bank was further delayed. Eventually, Younghusband's troops reached their positions and launched their attack. However, the objectives of their attack {{turned out to be}} the center of the left bank defenses. Through the rest of the afternoon, Younghusband's brigades failed to make much headway against the Ottoman defenders. With no cover on the ground, the assault battalions came under fire at long range from rifle, machinegun, and artillery. Few units made it closer than 300 yards before having to dig in for some cover.|$|E

NBC began broadcasting to the U.S. on the main transmitter, while Meloy spoke over the other radio with Captain Cavellini of the Rex, who jokingly invited all of the airmen down <b>for</b> <b>lunch</b> <b>at</b> his table.

500|$|A hunter named Robinson was {{the first}} {{inhabitant}} in the area whose name is known; around 1800 he had a cabin {{on the shores of}} Long Pond (now called Lake Ganoga), which is less than [...] northwest of the park. The first development within the park was the construction of the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike, which was built from 1822 to 1827 between the Pennsylvania communities of Berwick in the south and Towanda in the north. The turnpike, which Pennsylvania Route 487 mostly follows through the park, had daily stagecoach service from 1827 to 1851; the northbound stagecoach left Berwick in the morning and stopped <b>for</b> <b>lunch</b> <b>at</b> the Long Pond Tavern on the lake about noon.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Girl" [...] {{was directed by}} Bryan Barber and released in mid-February along with the video for [...] "Cater 2 U". It was inspired by Sex and the City, containing elements and influences of the sitcom in many scenes. The clip is split into two different sets: Destiny's Child in Beyoncé's apartment and the same trio on a fictional television show. It begins with Michelle and Kelly entering Beyoncé's apartment as she writes on her laptop. They settle down with snacks and wine as they watch a fictional show styled after Sex and the City. After the opening credits, Beyoncé and Michelle meet Kelly on the TV <b>for</b> <b>lunch</b> <b>at</b> a restaurant. Throughout the video, the women at home respond {{to the events of}} the program through gestures and actions, while, on the television, the dialogue of the song matches their conversations in the restaurant. Beyoncé confronts Kelly about her sad demeanor and suspected boyfriend problems, but she feigns shock and insists that nothing is wrong; however, neither Michelle nor Beyoncé are convinced. Viewers can see that, on one occasion, her boyfriend took very long to come home without explanation and, when he finally arrived, a hurt Kelly threw his food away before running upstairs avoiding him.|$|E

40|$|To {{encourage}} {{the cultivation of}} sorghum, which is more drought tolerant than maize, it is desirable to replace {{a portion of the}} maize used in school feeding programmes with sorghum. The immediate constraint was the acceptability of sorghum among school children. A set of sensory taste trials were established to evaluate the acceptability of sorghum in breakfast porridge (uji) and stiff porridge (ugali) used <b>for</b> <b>lunches</b> <b>at</b> three schools in Tanzania. A sample of 106 children participated in the trials. Each received uji made from both dehulled and hulled grain. On a different day each received ugali made from both dehulled and hulled grain. Almost 98 % of children found the sorghum acceptable as a replacement for maize in breakfast and lunch meals. It is hoped to substitute 10 % of the maize used in the school feeding programme with sorghum rising to 50 % in the next years...|$|R

2500|$|Frequent {{mentions}} of {{the restaurant}} in newspaper columns by Walter Winchell and Ward Morehouse added to Sardi’s growing popularity.

[...] Heywood Broun, Mark Hellinger, press agent Irving Hoffman, actor George Jessel, and Ring Lardner [...] were also Cheese Club members. In fact, it was Hoffman who first brought Alex Gard to Sardi's <b>for</b> <b>lunch</b> <b>at</b> the Cheese Club table. Gard drew caricatures of the Cheese Club members, and Vincent Sardi hung them above their table. It was then that Sardi recalled the drawings at Zelli's and made his deal with Gard.|$|E
2500|$|There {{was only}} time for two overs before stumps and Brian Statham made the ball lift outside the off-stump, {{which might have}} {{produced}} a wicket given another quarter of an hour, but Colin McDonald and Jim Burke survived the day on 8/0. The first day had produced only 142 runs and although the Saturday was bright and clear and good for batting, only 148 runs were made as an excellent England bowling attack regained the initiative and the Australian batsmen eked out the runs. Burke edged a catch to gully, but Trevor Bailey was too deep to catch it and after a slow start—and much to everybody's surprise—he peeled off a couple of cover-drives off Peter Loader. Loader was repeatedly no-balled {{and was replaced by}} Bailey and the openers took their partnership past fifty when the sightsreen was laboriously moved and Loader returned round the wicket to have Burke caught behind for 20. The teams went off <b>for</b> <b>lunch</b> <b>at</b> the fall of the wicket and returned on 55/1 with Neil Harvey coming in instead of Ken Mackay as announced by the scoreboard, indicating that Benaud wanted the runs to flow. Bailey had McDonald caught in slip for 42 in two hours and Norm O'Neill (who had not broken his finger as first thought) came in with the hopes of Australia hanging on his shoulders. May set a defensive field to limit his runmaking, but he hit his first ball for four before the runs dried up and he was outpaced by [...] "Slasher" [...] Mackay. Loader (4/56 with 19 no balls) caught Harvey l.b.w. after he had spent an hour making 14. Bailey (3/35) accounted for the out of form Peter Burge and had O'Neill was caught by a spectacular diving catch by Tom Graveney for 34 in 151 minutes, Jim Laker (2/15) had Mackay (16) caught behind, much to his displeasure and Australia ended the day on 156/6, 22 runs ahead. After the rest day Australia did not long survive the fall of Benaud (16) on the Monday morning, l.b.w. to Loader and the tail collapsed to 186 all out despite the best efforts of Alan Davidson (25), last man out to Laker.|$|E
