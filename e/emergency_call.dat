5|$|Global News {{reporter}} Jennifer Tryon {{attempted to}} file a Freedom of Information request for documents on June 29, but was refused; an employee came out {{from the back of}} the offices, and turned the City Clerk's chair around, so that they couldn't respond. City officials then called the OPP. After the request, the city issued a two line statement that documents are now part of investigations. OPP noted that the documents are still available through Freedom of Information requests, and that the situation likely didn't warrant an <b>emergency</b> <b>call</b> to police. The reporter was provided a FOI application on police arrival, and told to ignore instructions from their superiors on calling police. Tryon, producer Kieron O'Dea and cameraman Trevor Owens would later receive a Canadian Screen Award nomination for Breaking National News Reportage at the 1st Canadian Screen Awards.|$|E
5|$|Metropolitan Norway {{is divided}} into 27 police {{district}}s. Each district is further subdivided into local police stations and rural police districts, the latter led by a sheriff. Each police district is headquartered at a main police station and is led by a chief of police. Police districts hold a common pool of resources and personnel and have a common administration and budget. Each also has a joint operations center which also acts as an <b>emergency</b> <b>call</b> center for 112. Many of the larger districts have their own execution and enforcement authority, while this in integrated in the smaller districts. The size of the police districts varies, from Oslo with 2,500 employees and covering a population of 570,000 to Eastern Finnmark which has 160 employees and 30,000 residents.|$|E

Their third enlistment in response to the <b>emergency</b> <b>call</b> for troops to defend Washington, D.C. lasted 100 days from July to November 1864 during which they were stationed in various fortifications around Baltimore, Maryland, primarily in Fort McHenry.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background During {{the last}} stage of life, palliative care {{patients}} often experience episodes of respiratory distress, bleeding, pain or seizures. In such situations, caregivers may <b>call</b> <b>emergency</b> medical services leading to unwanted hospital admissions. The study aims {{to show the}} influence of our palliative care team to reducing <b>emergency</b> <b>calls</b> by cancer patients or their relatives during the last six month of life. Methods Fifty relatives of deceased patients who had been attended by our palliative care team were randomly selected. Data was obtained retrospectively during a structured interview. In addition to demographic data, the number of <b>emergency</b> <b>calls</b> made during the final {{six months of the}} patient's life, the reason for the call and the mental compound score (MCS- 12) of the caregivers was registered. Results Forty-six relatives agreed to the interview. <b>Emergency</b> <b>calls</b> were placed for 18 patients (39 %) during the final six months of their lives. There were a total of 23 <b>emergency</b> <b>calls.</b> In 16 cases (70 %) the patient was admitted to the hospital. Twenty-one (91 %) of the calls were made before patients had been enrolled to receive palliative care from the team, and two (9 %) were made afterwards. The mean mental compound score of the caregivers {{at the time of the}} interview was 41 (range 28 – 57). There was a lack of correlation between MCS- 12 and number of <b>emergency</b> <b>calls.</b> Conclusion <b>Emergency</b> <b>calls</b> were more likely to occur if the patients were not being attended by our palliative care team. Because of the lack of correlation between MCS- 12 and the number of <b>emergency</b> <b>calls,</b> the MCS- 12 cannot indicate that acutely stressful situations triggered the calls. However, we conclude that special palliative care programs can reduce psychosocial strain in family caregivers. Therefore, the number of <b>emergency</b> <b>calls</b> may be reduced and this fact allows more palliative patients to die at home. </p...|$|R

5|$|Cullompton United Charities {{provides}} {{a number of}} charitable services to residents of Cullompton. The majority of the funds come from bequests made to the parish from the seventeenth century onwards. Thirteen separate charities were combined in 1921 and then in 1953 further amalgamation went on with the Trott's almshouses, John Lanes Charity and the Charity of George Spicer combining to form the current United Charities. There are nine local almshouses which are available to local residents {{over the age of}} 55. They also offer Alpha Piperline <b>emergency</b> <b>call</b> services for the elderly, can refund up to £100 to school leavers under 25 who have spent money equipping themselves with tools, books, vocational training or further education and offer financial help needy individuals resident in the parish to help them purchase specific items. They also own a building called Community House in the town centre, where local organisations can hire meeting rooms.|$|E
5|$|On 8 August 1993, Mills and Mincione {{walked to}} the corner of De Vere Gardens and Kensington Road, London, but while {{crossing}} Kensington Road, Mills was knocked down by a police motorcycle, the last in a convoy of three, which was responding to an <b>emergency</b> <b>call.</b> Mills suffered crushed ribs, a punctured lung, and the loss of her left leg 6inches below the knee; a metal plate was later attached to her pelvis. In October 1993, she had another operation that further shortened her leg. Mills was awarded £200,000 by the police authority as recompense for her injuries, even though the police motorcyclist, PC Osbourne, was later cleared by magistrates of driving without due care and attention. After the accident, Mills sold her story to the News of the World, and gave other interviews, saying she earned £180,000. She used the money to set up the Heather Mills Health Trust (existed 2000–2004) which delivered prosthetic limbs to people, particularly children, who had lost limbs after stepping on landmines. Mills often shows people her prosthetic leg, once taking it off during an interview on the American talk show Larry King Live, in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{to other}} {{industrial}} {{cities in the}} U.S., Omaha suffered severe job losses in the 1950s, more than 10,000 in total, as both the railroad and meatpacking industries restructured. Stockyards and packing plants were located closer to ranches, and union achievements were lost as wages declined in surviving jobs. Many workers left the area {{if they could get}} to other jobs. Poverty deepened in areas of the city whose residents had depended on those jobs, specifically North and South Omaha. At the same time, with reduced revenues, the city had less financial ability to respond to longstanding problems. Despair after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in April 1968 contributed to riots in North Omaha, including one at the Logan Fontenelle Housing Project. For some, the Civil Rights Movement in Omaha, Nebraska evolved towards black nationalism, as the Black Panther Party was involved in tensions in the late 1960s. Organizations such as the Black Association for Nationalism Through Unity became popular among the city's African-American youth. This tension culminated in the cause célèbre trial of the Rice/Poindexter Case, in which an Omaha Police Department officer was killed by a bomb while answering an <b>emergency</b> <b>call.</b>|$|E

5|$|On 27 May, {{the first}} full day of the evacuation, one cruiser, eight destroyers, and 26 other craft were active. Admiralty {{officers}} combed nearby boatyards for small craft that could ferry personnel from the beaches out to larger craft in the harbour, as well as larger vessels that could load from the docks. An <b>emergency</b> <b>call</b> was put out for additional help, and by 31 May nearly four hundred small craft were voluntarily and enthusiastically {{taking part in the}} effort. The same day, the Luftwaffe heavily bombed Dunkirk, both the town and the dock installations. As the water supply was knocked out, the resulting fires could not be extinguished. An estimated thousand civilians were killed, one-third of the remaining population of the town. The Luftwaffe was met by 16 squadrons of the Royal Air Force, who claimed 38 kills on 27 May while losing 14 aircraft. Altogether, over 3,500 sorties were flown in support of Operation Dynamo. The RAF continued to take a heavy toll on the German bombers throughout the week. Soldiers being bombed and strafed while awaiting transport were for the most part unaware of the efforts of the RAF to protect them, as most of the dogfights took place far from the beaches. As a result, many British soldiers bitterly accused the airmen of doing nothing to help.|$|E
