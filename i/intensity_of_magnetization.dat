40|$|In {{a recent}} {{publication}} Wilson & McElhinny (1974) have reported a {{variation in the}} mean <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnetization</b> in basalts from a series of lava profiles from eastern Iceland (Dagley et al. 1967). They suggested that the observed increase in the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnetization</b> from profiles 6 to 5 (Fig. l(a)) might be due to basalts from the younger profiles (1 - 6) being geochemically distinct from the lavas from the older parts of the succession (profiles 7 - 21). This possibility remains, but a second explanation should be considered. Fig. I(b) shows the approximate position of each of the vertical profiles in relation to the probable top of the lava pile and the underlying zeolite zones. It is noteworthy that profiles 7 - 1 3 sample the deeper parts of the pile and that these profiles possess the lowest magnetic intensities. The inverse relationship between the intensity of magneti-zation and the depth of burial suggests that burial and the associated hydrothermal alteration have been important in partially demagnetizing the original magnetic moment of these rocks. This suggestion is supported by the work of Ade-Hall, Palmer & Hubbard (1971) who showed that significant oxidation of the magnetic phases due to zeolitization occurs at depths below the analcite zone. The nature, if any, of primary chemical variation within the lava pile is at present under investigation and preliminary work (Wood et al. 1976) suggests that the succession as a whole follows a single compositional trend...|$|E

The basis for modeling is the solution of a nonlinear integral equation, describing magnetization within isolated objects, allowing us to compute magnetic moments of the object, analyze their relationships, and provide a depiction of the surface anomaly produced by the different moments within the object.

40|$|Comparing {{the results}} of the first and second surveys over Ooshima Island, marked changes in the earth's {{magnetic}} field were found out during the period from beginning to end of the eruption of Volcano Mihara, 1950. The magnetic dip-angle decreased all over the island. The largest value of the decrease amounted to as much as 30 minutes of arc. Applying the method devised by the writer for finding out the position, intensity and direction of an underground magnetic dipole directly from the distribution on the earth's surface, {{it was found that the}} changes obtained here may be almost explained as due to a dipole situated just beneath the centre of the island at a depth of 5. 5 km, the direction being approximately opposite to the earth's magnetic field. Taking into account the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnetization</b> of rocks composing the volcano, the generation of the dipole may be attributed to the demagnetization of a roughly spherical region having a radius of a few kilometers, while the demagnetization seems to be due to the rise in temperature in the said region associated with the eruption. It is of interest that the general mode of the change closely resembles that observed in the case of Volcano Miyake-sima where the rocks composing the volcano is also basalt. Comparison with the survey carried out in 1936 was also made. However, no marked changes were to be found.

RESULTS IN IRON. 1) In constant longitudinal fields, the magnetization, so long as the field is weak, of iron wire or tube increases at first, till it reaches a maximum, and then decreases to a value less than the initial, by applying a gradually increasing transverse field. 2) In fields greater than 55 C. G. S. units, the magnetization in the longitudinal direction decreases from the outset. 3) The effect of longitudinal field on the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> transverse <b>magnetization</b> is exactly the same as the effect of transverse field on the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> longitudinal <b>magnetization.</b> 4) By first applying the magnetizing 6 eld either {{in the direction of the}} tube or perpendicular to it, and then another perpendicular to it, the magnetization in the direction of the first application of the field is always greater than when the order <b>of</b> <b>magnetizations</b> is reversed. 5) The change of longitudinal or transverse magnetization by transverse or longitudinal field is independent of the direction of the field. 6) The hysteresis curve attending the cyclic change of the transverse field, while the longitudinal field is kept constant, is similar to that of torsion. The hysteresis by the cyclic change of the longitudinal field, while the transverse field is kept constant, is the same as the ordinary hysteresis, except that the area of the loop is considerably reduced.

30|$|When {{determining}} the remanent magnetization (RM) of palaeomagnetic rock samples, {{it is assumed}} that the samples can be approximated by a magnetic dipole. This assumption greatly simplifies the inverse problem of {{determining the}} RM from the measured magnetic field of the sample. The magnetic field of the normally used cylindrical rock samples is however not identical to that of a dipole and care must be taken not to introduce any systematic errors. A numerical test of the effect of cylindrical sample shape on the determination of RM for a spinner-type magnetometer is presented. We find that for a spinner magnetometer the non-ideal sample shape has an insignificant effect (less than 0.3 ° error), for even the smallest possible sample-sensor distance. Comparing static and spinner-type magnetometers, it is clear that spinner-type magnetometers are less affected by the sample shape. Inhomogeneously magnetized samples are an obvious source of error when determining the RM. We numerically test the error in the determination of RM for the simple case of a laminated cylindrical sample with constant direction, but varying <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnetization</b> between the laminae. For strongly inhomogeneous samples we find an error of ∼ 4 ° for typical spinner-type magnetometer and ∼ 10 ° for static-type magnetometers.|$|E
40|$|Assuming {{uniformity}} of magnetization, {{the direction and}} <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnetization</b> of nine seamounts in the Western Pacific {{off the coast of}} Japan have been computed from their topographic and magnetic surveys. The average position of the palaeomagnetic poles from the three seamounts in the Pacific Basin is at 56 °N- 66 °W, which agrees in latitude with the average pole position of 51 °N- 14 °W obtained previously from another group of four seamounts in the Pacific Basin off Hokkaido. A group of three seamounts west of the Izu-Bonin Arc (Shikoku Basin) gave an average pole position of 76 °N- 44 °W. The difference in latitude between the pole positions of the groups within and outside the Pacific Basin can be interpreted as caused by a northerly drift of the Pacific Ocean floor. The radiometric age of the dredged rock samples indicates that the seamounts in the Pacific Basin originated in the Cretaceous. The same method of analysis has been applied to three active Japanese volcanoes over which aeromagnetic surveys had been made. Of the three volcanoes, two volcanic islands gave palaeomagnetic poles not far from the present geographic pole, but the inland volcano Aso gave a pole at low latitude. Low-latitude poles were also obtained from two undated seamounts on the NW Pacific (Shatsky) Rise. 1966 年に行なわれた日米協同観測結果にもとづいて,西大洋海域における 9 個の海山について,その磁化を計算した. 計算結果から求められる古地磁気学的磁極は,主として北部大西洋に集中し,かつて,北海道沖の 4 個の海山から求められたものと一致する傾向を示す. 底質岩石の年代は白亜紀末であろうことがK-Ar法によつて得られているので,今回の研究は,太平洋底が,中生代末以来,現在の磁極に対して北上したという事実を示唆する. このことは大陸移動説におけるゴンドワナ大陸の分裂とも,最近の海洋底拡大説とも矛盾しない. 阿蘇,桜島,伊豆大島等については,航空磁気測量結果にもとづいて,同様の計算が行なわれた. 阿蘇火山の場合には,地形のみでなく,地下に双極子を仮定する方がよいように思われる...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objectives}} of the MAGSAT mission was to measure the <b>intensity</b> and direction <b>of</b> <b>magnetization</b> <b>of</b> the Earth's crust. A significant effort was directed to the large crustal anomalies first delineated by the POGO mission. The MAGSAT data are capable of spatial resolution of the crustal field to 250 km wavelength with reliability limits to less than 1 nT in the mean. The difficulties of dealing with less than the most robust of the MAGSAT anomalies is that often {{there is no more}} than the magnetic fields themselves to constrain geophysical models of the interior, and no independent means of assessing the quality of the crustal anomaly data in interpreting the subsurface are available...|$|R
40|$|Measurements of {{magnetic}} properties {{were made on}} basalt samples recovered from Holes 597 B and 597 C. This pa-per describes the <b>intensity</b> and inclination <b>of</b> natural remanent <b>magnetization</b> (NRM), the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> anhysteretic re-manent <b>magnetization</b> (ARM), the median demagnetizing field (MDF) for NRM and ARM, the initial susceptibility, the Koenigsberger ratio (Q). The mean inclinations (/) after alternating field demagnetization for Holes 597 B and 597 C are 45. 4 ± 7. 1 ° and 45. 0 ± 7. 6 °, respectively.

30|$|The further {{maps and}} interpretations {{addressed}} in this paper were achieved after removal of the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) and anthropogenic anomalies. To optimize the interpretation, the magnetic anomalies have been reprocessed using several types of mathematical transformations. In {{the case of a}} symmetrical structure with a dominant induced magnetization, the associated magnetic anomaly is only symmetrical (pseudo-gravimetric) at the magnetic pole. The skewness or deformation of an anomaly {{is a function of the}} inclination <b>of</b> the <b>magnetization,</b> and in the case of a dominant induced <b>magnetization,</b> <b>of</b> the inclination of the magnetic field. In northern Alsace, this inclination is approximately 64 °. To remove this effect, the anomalies have to be reduced to the pole. First and second vertical derivatives are used to delineate the boundaries of subvertical magnetic bodies (Fig.  6). Tilt is a transformation that also locates subvertical boundaries and faults, but in addition, it estimates the depths of the tops of the structures (Salem et al. 2007) (Fig.  7). The analytical signal and the square of the analytical signal delineate the fabric of the magnetic basement, but the intensity is also a function of the depth and the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>magnetization.</b>|$|R
