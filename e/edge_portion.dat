40|$|Use of self {{actuated}} {{leading edge}} spoilers is virtually unknown on wind turbine blades. A simple arrangement has been devised and implemented on a 7. 5 metre diameter medium solidity rotor.

This movement is adequately dampened with the help of dashpots. In low and moderate wind speeds the auxiliary airfoil remains undeflected and thereby generates a higher overall lift for the blade. In higher wind speeds the airfoil deflects in a manner of getting progressively stalled and thus providing control on rotor overspeeding. This movement is self actuated and appears quite stable. Further analytical and wind tunnel studies are recommended to exploit full potential of such an arrangement which is inexpensive and appears appropriate atleast respect of small wind turbines...|$|E

Otolith core and <b>edge</b> <b>portions</b> were compared between and within individuals from the same cohort (n = 120) to determine whether isotopically different environments were inhabited by juveniles and adults from different latitudes. A comparison between individuals revealed that δ 18 O and δ 13 C increased with latitude and were generally higher in edge than in core portions. Similarly, within most individual otoliths, δ 18 O and δ 13 C were higher in edge than in core portions. For some individuals, however, {{there was no difference}} in δ 18 O between core and <b>edge</b> <b>portions,</b> potentially signifying self-recruitment to the area or occupation of areas of similar chemistry. The majority of individuals from 19 to 22 °S and almost half of individuals from 18 °S displayed juvenile δ 18 O signatures characteristic of a warmer environment, suggesting movement to cooler environments or potential southerly migration of early life stages to adult habitat. In contrast, almost half of adult individuals in the most northern latitude (18 °S) appeared to originate from cooler environments, suggesting movement to warmer environments or potential northward migration with ontogeny. These results infer that movement of L. miniatus individuals occurred across different isotopic environments with life stage and was related to latitude. Isotope ratios provided insight into movement patterns of L. miniatus at scales that will be important for delineating management units for this commercially important species...|$|R

The propulsor blade is coupled to and extends radially outwardly of the rotor. A first annular fairing is rotatable with the propulsor blade and interposed between the propulsor blade and the rotor. A second fairing is located longitudinally adjacent to the first fairing. The first fairing and the second fairing are differentially rotatable. The air {{control mechanism}} includes a platform fixedly coupled to a radially inner end of the propulsor blade. The platform is generally positioned in a first opening and a first fairing.

In a second position corresponding with the second propulsor blade pitch, an <b>edge</b> <b>portion</b> of the platform is displaced radially outwardly from the first fairing.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the fabrication and manufacturing process of a simulated leading <b>edge</b> <b>portion</b> of a turbine blade with a porous superalloy structure constructed using Laser Additive Manufacturing (LAM) techniques. The LAM method was assessed {{based on its}} ability to successfully fabricate complex, porous structures within traditional turbine components. To simulate the manufacturing process, the leading edge was designed, fabricated, heat-treated and closely examined for manufacturing accuracy. Manufactured out of Inconel, the leading edge is a single piece which is capable of both internal and external cooling through the use of shower head cooling as well as with an internal cavity undergoing jet impingement cooling. The internal structure was designed as a lattice of intersecting holes in order to mimic that of a porous material. External hole geometry was measured to determine the accuracy and tolerances of the manufacturing process in order to analyze the hole uniformity over the leading <b>edge</b> <b>portion</b> of the blade. Flow testing was performed in order to characterize the effective flow area and uniformity at the exit of porous structures at multiple pressure ratios. The velocity field at the exit was measured and compared with the physical geometry in order to pinpoint manufacturing defects. The analysis outline yields quantitative data on the LAM process, providing insight {{as to whether or not}} it is a viable option for current turbine blade production...|$|E

40|$|Leading edge flutter is {{a problem}} that is unique to a super-cavitating hydrofoil. At high speed, the leading <b>edge</b> <b>portion</b> has been {{observed}} to oscillate while the trailing edge remains motionless. In this study, several flat plate hydrofoils were tested. The experimental results indicate that the phenomenon is a complex function of speed, angle of attack, cavitation number and mass ratio. Leading edge flutter was also observed to cause cavity pinching. A theoretical study was also conducted. Two mathematical models are presented here. The first one models the flexible chord foil as a rigid chord foil hinged at the trailing edge; the second model treats the fluid-structure interaction problem of a flexible chord foil cantilevered at the trailing edge. Both models resemble leading edge flutter near zero cavitation number in some respects. At short and moderate cavity lengths, leading edge flutter phenomenon is influenced by the cavity closure condition. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{ability to}} {{continuously}} monitor {{the positions of}} mobile objects is important in many applications. While most past work has been set in Euclidean spaces, the mobile objects relevant in many applications are constrained to spatial networks. This paper addresses the problem of range monitoring of mobile objects in this setting, in which network distance is concerned. An architecture is proposed where the mobile clients and a central server share computation, the objective being to obtain scalability by utilizing {{the capabilities of the}} clients. The clients issue location reports to the server, which is in charge of data storing and query processing. The server associates each range monitoring query with the network-edge portions it covers. This enables incremental maintenance of each query, and it also enables shared maintenance of concurrent queries by identifying the overlaps among such queries. The mobile clients contribute to the query processing by encapsulating their host <b>edge</b> <b>portion</b> identifiers in their reports to the server. Extensive empirical studies indicate that the paper’s proposal is efficient and scalable, in terms of both query load and moving-object load. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Semiconductor {{devices are}} usually formed {{on a single}} silicon wafer during a batch {{processing}} method. Individual devices are separated from the wafer during the wafer sawing or dicing step. Subsequent packaging processes are then performed on the individual devices, whose <b>edge</b> <b>portions</b> are very susceptible to mechanical damage from the sawing process. Defects formed along device edges due to the dicing saw blade often provide potential sites for serious reliability problems. If the scribing area is reduced, {{the number of the}} separated devices from a single wafer increases, which results in productivity improvement. However, the closer the scribing position of the saw blade comes to the active device pattern, the greater possibility of sawing-induced damage to the active pattern is. Thus, this work shows methods to reduce the negative impact of the saw blade while maintaining close proximity of the scribe lines to the IC devices. In particular, this work suggests that a decrease {{in the size of the}} diamond particles embedded in the saw blade and in the rotation speed of the saw blade might contribute to the prevention of sawing-induced damage to device patterns...|$|R

Chlorophyll data and high spectral resolution spectrometer laboratory reflectance data were acquired for multiple collections of single detached sugar maple leaves variously affected by the insect over the 1988 growing season. Reflectance data indicated consistent and diagnostic differences in the red <b>edge</b> <b>portion</b> (680 - 750 nm) of the spectrum among the various samples and populations of leaves.

30|$|The past {{median filter}} {{operates}} on the pixel {{points of the}} image by the same operation method, which causes {{the value of the}} real signal point to change, and the image has a fuzzy problem, so it is not suitable for the system application of this paper. If the true pixel signal point and the signal point contaminated by noise are accurately distinguished, the misoperation of the true pixel signal point can be avoided, and the clarity of the courseware image can be improved. Using the improved switch median filtering method, the pixel of the courseware image can be accurately judged to avoid misoperation of the true pixel signal point. For a pixel of a suspected color image, there is a strong correlation between adjacent points, and the brightness value of a point in the image is close to the brightness value of the adjacent point. The pixel points of the isolated point of the pixel and the image portion of the <b>edge</b> <b>portion</b> are generally considered to be noise points. Therefore, in a courseware image, if there is a large difference between the value of a certain pixel point and its neighborhood value, the correlation between the pixel point and the neighborhood is low, and the point {{is considered to be a}} noise point, which needs to be performed filter processing. If the point value is close to the neighbor value, it is the true signal point.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT-A {{growing number}} of studies have focused on {{evaluating}} vegetation indices in terms of their sensitivity to vegetation biophysical parameters as well as to external factors affecting canopy reflectance. In this context, leaf and canopy radiative transfer models have provided a basis for understanding the behaviour of such indices, particularly their resistance to external perturbing effects related to soil background, illumination, and atmospheric conditions. But, so far no studies have thoroughly assessed the impact of leaf chlorophyll concentration changes on the ability of spectral indices to predict green leaf area index (LAI). Because the variables LAI and chlorophyll content have similar effects on canopy reflectance in the visible and red <b>edge</b> <b>portions</b> of the solar spectrum, {{there is a need to}} uncouple these effects in order to accurately assess each of these variables. In the present work we used PROSPECT and SAILH models to simulate a wide range of crop canopy reflectances which were used to study the sensitivity of a set of vegetation indices to LAI variability.
