Now “all these instances agree in one point, the coldness of the object dewed, in comparison with the air in contact with it.” But there still remains the most important case of all, that of nocturnal dew: does the same circumstance exist in this case? “Is <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the object dewed is colder than the air?

6000|$|In fact, {{the whole}} {{evidence}} is {{in favour of}} evolution, and there is none against it. And I say this, although perfectly {{well aware of the}} seeming difficulties which have been built up upon what appears to the uninformed to be a solid foundation. I meet constantly with the argument that the doctrine of evolution cannot be well founded, because it requires the lapse of a very vast period of time; the duration of life upon the earth, thus implied, is inconsistent with the conclusions arrived at by the astronomer and the physicist. I may venture to say that I am familiar with those conclusions, inasmuch as some years ago, when President of the Geological Society of London, I took the liberty of criticising them, and of showing in what respects, as it appeared to me, they lacked complete and thorough demonstration. But, putting that point aside, suppose that, as the astronomers, or some of them, and some physical philosophers, tell us, it is impossible that life could have endured upon the earth for as long a period as is required by the doctrine of evolution--supposing that to be proved--I desire to be informed, what is the foundation for the statement that evolution does require so great a time? The biologist knows nothing whatever of the amount of time which may be required for the process of evolution. It is a matter of fact that the equine forms which I have described to you occur, in the order stated, in the Tertiary formations. But I have not the slightest means of guessing whether it took a million of years, or ten millions, or a hundred millions, or a thousand millions of years, to give rise to that series of changes. A biologist has no means of arriving at any conclusion as to the amount of time which may be needed for a certain quantity of organic change. He takes his time from the geologist. The geologist, considering the rate at which deposits are formed and the rate at which denudation goes on upon {{the surface of the earth}}, arrives at more or less justifiable conclusions as to the time which is required for the deposit of a certain thickness of rocks; and if he tells me that the Tertiary formations required 500,000,000 years for their deposit, I suppose he has good ground for what he says, and I take that as a measure of the duration of the evolution of the horse from the Orohippus up to its present condition. And, if he is right, undoubtedly evolution is a very slow process, and requires a great deal of time. But suppose, now, that an astronomer or a physicist--for instance, my friend Sir William Thomson--tells me that my geological authority is quite wrong; and that he has weighty evidence to show that life could not possibly have existed upon the surface of the earth 500,000,000 years ago, because the earth would have then been too hot to allow of life, my reply is: [...] "That is not my affair; settle that with the geologist, and when you have come to an agreement among yourselves I will adopt your conclusion." [...] We take our time from the geologists and physicists; and it is monstrous that, having taken our time from the physical philosopher's clock, the physical philosopher should turn round upon us, and say we are too fast or too slow. What we desire to know is, is <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> evolution took place? As to the amount of time which evolution may have occupied, we are in the hands of the physicist and the astronomer, whose business it is to deal with those questions.|$|E

This study identifies districts in India {{in which there was}} significant Naxalite activity and correlating the findings with district-level economic, social, and crime indicators. The econometric results show that, after controlling for other variables, Naxalite activity in a district had, if anything, a dampening effect on its level of violent crime and crimes against women. Furthermore, even after controlling for other variables, the probability of a district being Naxalite- affected rose with an increase in its poverty rate and fell with a rise in its literacy rate. So, one prong in an anti-Naxalite strategy would be to address the twin issues of poverty and illiteracy in India...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} in studying human origins from an evolutionary perspective is uniqueness: we have evolved to fill a social and cognitive niche that is so distinctive it renders useless the usual investigative tool of careful comparison with other, similar species. Features such as cognition, communication and cooperation reached, in humans, unprecedented levels of sophistication and complexity. These features not only converge to the social dimension but they also lack a clear function outside <b>it,</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> makes epiphenomenal explanations unlikely. The main goal of this thesis is {{to shed light on}} the conditions that led to the evolution of modern humans through the development of computational models. Our research hypothesis {{is based on the assumption}} that the human “primeval niche” lies in the intersection of three fundamental phenomena: cooperation, communication and cognition. We argue that these three elements are intimately connected and that their intersection is the ideal spot to explore the so called human cognitive explosion. The new internal selective pressures that arise from any cooperative environment trigger asymmetric competitive co-evolutionary arms races that can pull the population in the opposing directions of altruism and selfishness. Co evolutionary feedback loops usually stagnate due to their increasing biological cost, however, in the human case, the invention of communication and language as a tool for social cohesion opened up a new “medium”, where both co operators and defectors can play their own personal “battle” at a lower cost and at a faster pace. Following this, we re-implement and develop several models of the evolution of communication and cooperation. As this thesis progresses, the scope of our modelling efforts is narrowed towards the study of the emergence of the simplest cooperative mechanism that explicitly relies on communication and important cognitive abilities: indirect reciprocity. Our findings strongly suggest that primitive communication could have evolved in order to sustain cooperation through indirect reciprocity and therefore communication and, eventually, language could have evolved as a tool for social cohesion. Moreover, our results indicate that there are two different evolutionary paths towards this goal. The first includes low levels of gossip in a trusting environment governed by a moderately heterogeneous moral system. The second consists of high levels of gossip in a suspicious context governed by a homogeneous moral system. The main contribution of this thesis is a plausible evolutionary outline of the primeval niche that early humans occupied and its depiction through the interactions and interdependence of the three cornerstones of human nature: cognition, communication and cooperation...|$|E
40|$|A comic scene ridiculing the Tammany Democrats of New York City. Tammany headquarters, {{known as}} the "Wigwam," here erupts in a drunken fracas over the Democratic {{platform}} for the presidential race of 1852. The platform specifically endorsed the Compromise of 1850, which incorporated the Fugitive Slave Act, a measure highly repugnant to abolitionists and Free-Soil or Barnburner Democrats. The artist also capitalizes on current rumors of candidate Franklin Pierce's bouts of alcoholism. In the center stands a wooden platform, {{in the process of}} collapsing on one end under the riotous exertions of abolitionists. On the other end (at left) stand Pierce and his runnning mate William R. King. Pierce, visibly drunk and swooning, is supported by King. Yet he tries to speak, "Fel-er-cit-zens. I'm bliged to you. I, that is [...] King? did you put that "Bri" (hic) "Bri" (hic) "Brick!" (damm the word) [...] in my "Hat?" Fel [...] citizens? this is my mot (hic) mottoe!

Come now? stand up, or lay down, one or the other. " King leads Pierce toward an Irish tough (far left), one of the party rank and file, who steps onto the platform and declares enthusiastically, "Your the boy for this crowd! slap down yer paw!... aint we a go in ter have a nice time when we gitm you in the white house? well we is! hoss! wont we lick Mexico again? wont we go ter Cuba and kiss the purty Spanish galls? wont we lamm the British? & Choke Louis Napoleon? well we will!... " The platform itself is inscribed with the warning: "In consequence of the Ricketty Construction of this Platform, all Barnburners, Free-Soilers, & Abbolitionists are requested to Tread on it as lightly as possible. " The structure breaks up on the right amid a crowd of brawling Democrats, one of them carrying an "Abbolition" banner. In the left foreground, a muscular, bare-chested "Old Hunker" (conservative Democrat) sends a Free-Soiler flying with a punch, saying, "How do you like that for a Change?" To which the Free-Soiler answers, "I should like it better without the change?" In the center sits a man in athletic costume holding a bottle.
