5|$|While killing {{raccoons}} {{is legal}} during the hunting season, typically September to February, some hunters merely tree the raccoon {{and then leave}} it unharmed. In competitive hunts, where the objective <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>demonstrate</b> the skill of the dog, killing or harming the raccoon will often result in disqualification. Hunting for the sport without killing the raccoon, which is equated to catch and release fishing, or chasing raccoons from crop fields is legal year-round.|$|E

Yet some scholars recognize in this story too, as {{in other parts of the}} account of Solomon's reign, ironic elements which are not consistent with the story's overt purpose to glorify Solomon.|$|E

The three categories are measured with the following metrics. Reproductive health {{is measured by the}} maternal mortality rate and the adolescent fertility rate. Empowerment is indicated by the share of parliamentary seats held by each sex and secondary and higher education levels of each sex. Finally, the labor market aspect of the GII is measured by women's participation rate in the workforce. Mathematically, it is the approximated loss of human development to women due to inequality.|$|E

Our first goal <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>demonstrate</b> the production of growth inhibiting factors by turbot following the methodology of Yurl and Perlmutter. A series of successive experiments was performed. Extracts from turbot culture water were tested for GIF presence in early life stage tests using eggs and larvae and small scale growth trials with juveniles. Our second goal <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>demonstrate</b> the transfer of GIF between tanks. Four experiments involving the integration of experimental tanks in a farm scale setting were performed. Our third goal <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>demonstrate</b> the presence of GIF at commercial farms. Two juvenile growth trials were performed...|$|R

It is an [...] "affirmation {{of the goodness of}} the child". Summerhill is the story of Summerhill School's origins, its programs and pupils, how they live and are affected by the program, and Neill's own educational philosophy. It is split into seven chapters that introduce the school and discuss parenting, sex, morality and religion, [...] "children's problems", [...] "parents' problems", and [...] "questions and answers".|$|E
500|$|For example, the {{incident}} with the [...] "powhitetrash" [...] girls {{takes place in}} chapter 5, when Maya was ten years old, well before Angelou's recounting of her rape in chapter 12, which occurred when Maya was 8. [...] Walker explains that Angelou's purpose in placing the vignettes {{in this way is}} that it followed her thematic structure. [...] Angelou's editor, Robert Loomis, agrees, stating that Angelou could rewrite any of her books by changing the order of her facts to make a different impact on the reader. [...] Hagen sees Angelou's structure somewhat differently, focusing on Maya's journey [...] "to establish a worthwhile self-concept", and states that she structures the book into three parts: arrival, sojourn, and departure, which occur both geographically and psychologically. [...] However, Hagen notes that instead of beginning Caged Bird chronologically, with Maya and Bailey's arrival in Stamps, Angelou begins the book much later chronologically by recounting an embarrassing experience at church, an incident that demonstrates Maya's diminished sense of self, insecurity, and lack of status. [...] Hagen explains that Angelou's purpose <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>demonstrate</b> Maya's journey from insecurity to her feelings of worth gained by becoming a mother {{at the end of the}} book.|$|E
500|$|Members of the United States {{armed forces}} are exposed to CS during initial {{training}}, and during training refresher courses or equipment maintenance exercises, using CS tablets that are melted on a hotplate. This <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>demonstrate</b> the importance of properly wearing a gas or protective mask, as the agent's presence quickly reveals an improper fit or seal of the mask's rubber gaskets against the face. Following exposure while wearing a mask, recruits are ordered to remove the masks and endure exposure in the room. These exercises also encourage confidence {{in the ability of}} the equipment to protect the wearer from such chemical attacks. Such an event is a requirement for graduation from United States Army Basic Training, Air Force Basic Military Training, Navy Basic Training, and Marine Corps recruit training. CS gas in the form of grenades is also used extensively in the United States Marine Corps and United States Army in some service schools. CS gas is used during the final field exercise of the Scout Sniper Basic Course to simulate being compromised. In addition, it is used during the [...] escape-and-evasion exercise ("Trail of Tears"), the last event before graduation from the course. It is also used during several events in the Marine Corps Basic Reconnaissance Course (BRC) including some rucksack runs and escape-and-evasion exercises. While students going through the course are given the opportunity to bring and wear a gas mask for the event, usually none are worn because once donned, gas masks could not be removed {{until the end of the}} exercise. This could last anywhere from 3–12 hours and would make running 25km while wearing [...] of gear virtually impossible.|$|E
