The difference sometimes exceeds this limit because of an inaccurate trajectory prediction at the time of command generation, leading to non-negligible decline of the signal intensity. The effect of such antenna mispointing on the measured signal intensity is corrected before analysis using the measured antenna pattern (Toda et al. 2010) and the trajectory data reconstructed after the experiment.

The overall shape of the 2 D velocity distribution function and the location of the maxima at full and <b>half</b> <b>beam</b> injection energy are well reproduced in velocity-space tomographic inversions, if the noise level in the measurements is below 10 %.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate three tangential breast irradiation techniques i. e. conventional technique, gantry tilting technique and half-beam block technique in terms of the percentage of irradiated lung volume and high dose lung volume for patients of different sizes. Materials and Method: Treatment planning of the three tangential breast irradiation techniques was performed using the CT scans of 20 patients with early-stage breast cancer after lumpectomy. Results: When compared with conventional technique, both <b>half</b> <b>beam</b> block technique and gantry tilting technique irradiated a significantly smaller percentage of lung volume and delivered a smaller percentage of high dose (above 30 Gy) volume in the lung.

The combined effect of tangential separation and technique only produced significant effect on the percentage of total lung volume irradiated but not on the high dose volume.

We present a catalogue of 7394 extragalactic sources at 182 MHz detected in the RA = 0 field of the Murchison Widefield Array Epoch of Reionization observation programme. Motivated by unprecedented requirements for precision and reliability we develop new methods for source finding and selection. We apply machine learning methods to self-consistently classify the relative reliability of 9490 source candidates. A subset of 7466 are selected based on reliability class and signal-to-noise ratio criteria. These are statistically cross-matched to four other radio surveys using both position and flux density information. We find 7369 sources to have confident matches, including 90 partially resolved sources that split into a total of 192 sub-components. An additional 25 unmatched sources are included as new radio detections. The catalogue sources have a median spectral index of − 0. 85. Spectral flattening is seen towards lower frequencies with a median of − 0. 71 predicted at 182 MHz. The astrometric error is 7 arcsec compared to a 2. 3 arcmin beam FWHM.

40|$|Purpose: In cone-beam {{computed}} tomography (CBCT), {{and in particular}} in cone-beam breast {{computed tomography}} (CBBCT), an important issue is {{the reduction of the}} image artifacts produced by photon scatter and the reduction of patient dose. In this work, the authors propose to apply the detector displacement technique (also known as asymmetric detector or “extended view” geometry) to approach this goal. Potentially, this type of geometry, and the accompanying use of a beam collimator to mask the unirradiated half-object in each projection, permits some reduction of radiation dose with respect to conventional CBBCT and a sizeable reduction of the overall amount of scatter in the object, for a fixed contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). Methods: The authors consider a scan configuration in which the projection data are acquired from an asymmetrically positioned detector that covers only one half of the scan field of view. Monte Carlo simulations and measurements, with their CBBCT laboratory scanner, were performed using PMMA phantoms of cylindrical (70 -mm diameter) and hemiellipsoidal (140 -mm diameter) shape simulating the average pendant breast, at 80 kVp. Image quality was evaluated in terms of contrast, noise, CNR, contrast-to-noise ratio per unit of dose (CNRD), and spatial resolution as width of line spread function for high contrast details. Results: Reconstructed images with the asymmetric detector technique deviate less than 1 % from reconstruction with a conventional symmetric detector (detector view) and indicate a reduction of the cupping artifact in CT slices. The maximum scatter-to-primary ratio {{at the center of the}} phantom decreases by about 50 % for both small and large diameter phantoms (e. g., from 0. 75 in detector view to 0. 40 in extended view geometry at the central axis of the 140 -mm diameter PMMA phantom). Less cupping produces an increase of the CT number accuracy and an improved image detail contrast, but the associated increase of noise observed may produce a decrease of detail CNR. By simulating the energy deposited inside the phantoms, the authors evaluated a maximum 50 % reduction of the absorbed dose at the expense of a decrease of CNR, for the <b>half</b> <b>beam</b> irradiation of the object performed with the displaced detector technique with respect to full beam irradiation. The decrease in CNR, and in absorbed dose as well, translates into a detail CNRD showing values comparable to or higher than the ones obtained for a conventional symmetric detector technique, attributed to the effect of decreased scatter in particular at the axis of the irradiated object. An estimate is provided (about 12 %) for the average dose reduction possible in CBBCT at constant CNR for the average uncompressed breast (14 cm diameter, 50 % glandularity), in case of minimum image overlapping in extended view. Conclusions: Simulations and experiments show that CBCT reconstructions with the displaced detector technique and with a <b>half</b> <b>beam</b> collimator are less affected by scatter artifacts, which could lead to some decrease of the radiation dose to the irradiated object with respect to a conventional reconstruction. This dose reduction is associated with increase of noise, decrease of CNR, but equal or improved CNRD values. The use of a small area detector would allow also to reduce the apparatus cost and to improve the data transfer speed with a corresponding increment of frame rate...|$|E

Dose distributions from a linear accelerator were measured using an ion chamber in a water phantom and thermoluminescent dosimeters in a heterogeneous anthropomorphic phantom. Test cases included square fields, rectangular fields, fields having different source-to-surface distances, wedged fields, irregular fields, obliquely incident fields, asymmetrically collimated fields with wedges, multileafe collimator-shaped fields, and two heterogeneous density cases. The data set was used to validate the photon dose calculation algorithm in a radiation treatment planning system (Eclipse). Eclipse calculated photon doses to within the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) Task Group 53 (TG- 53) criteria for 99 % of points in the buildup region, 93 % of points in the inner region, 90 % of points in the outer region, and 88 % of points in the penumbra.

40|$|The {{earthquake}} of Northridge, CA in 1994 caused {{damages in}} steel moment frame buildings {{due to the}} brittle fractures in beam to column connections. This led to the modifications and improvements in the connection detailing used prior to the Northbridge earthquake. These improvements included use of better welding material and process, use of cover plates (such as Welded Flange Plate connections (WFP)), Reduced Beam Section (RBS) etc. RBS and WFP connections {{are the two most}} widely used connection configuration today. Both RBS and WFP connections allow the steel moment frame systems to extensively yield and deform plastically thus avoiding brittle fracturing occurring at the connections. Steel moment frames are comprised of beams and column, in which beams are rigidly connected with columns by welding or bolting. Members and joints resist flexural and shear forces and lateral stability is achieved through bending of the frame elements. WFP connection uses the cover plates of certain thickness and length. This addition of cover plate increases the depth of the beam at the face of the column and thus forces the plastic hinge to form away from face of the column at a certain distance. The RBS connection also protects the beam column connection by forcing the plastic hinge in a beam to form away {{from the face of the}} column at a certain distance within the reduced section. This research aims to compare the two types of steel moment connections, WFP and RBS connections, in terms of ductility, strength and stiffness.
