5|$|Japan Airlines Flight 350, a DC-8, {{crashed in}} 1982 {{short of the}} runway in Tokyo, after the mentally ill captain {{attempted}} suicide during the final approach phase of the flight, by putting the <b>inboard</b> <b>engines</b> into reverse thrust. Of the 174 people aboard, 24 died.|$|E
5|$|The Skyfleet S570 {{aircraft}} in the film was an ex-British Airways 747-200B G-BDXJ which had its engines removed and was modified for its appearance in the film. The modified aircraft had the outboard engines replaced by external fuel tanks, while the <b>inboard</b> <b>engines</b> were replaced by a mock-up pair of engines on each inboard pylon. The cockpit profile was altered to make the 747 look like a prototype of an advanced airliner. The plane used {{can be seen on}} the BBC motoring programme Top Gear on the Test Track.|$|E
25|$|The British Air Ministrys Inspector of Accidents {{reported}} that the accident had been caused by icing in the carburetters of all four engines. This caused a full loss {{of power in the}} <b>inboard</b> <b>engines</b> and partial loss in the outer; the commander of the Cavalier had reported icing problems prior to ditching. The inspector recommended that extra heating of carburetters and of the incoming air be provided and that a temperature indicator be installed. He also advised that passengers should be instructed in the fastening of lifebelts and the location of emergency exits and recommended the provision of extra life-saving equipment like rafts and pyrotechnic signals and that passengers should fasten safety belts at take-off and alighting.|$|E
25|$|Failure of {{a single}} <b>inboard</b> <b>engine,</b> from a set of four, has a much smaller effect on controllability. This is because an <b>inboard</b> <b>engine</b> {{is closer to the}} aircraft's centre of gravity, so the lack of yawing moment is decreased. In this situation, if speed is {{maintained}} at or above the published VMCA, as determined for the critical engine, safe control can be maintained.|$|R

500|$|The last B-52A (serial 52-0003) was {{modified}} and redesignated NB-52A in 1959 {{to carry the}} North American X-15. A pylon was fitted under the right wing between the fuselage and the <b>inboard</b> <b>engines</b> with a 6feet x 8feet (1.8m x 2.4m) section removed from the right wing flap to fit the X-15 tail. Liquid oxygen and hydrogen peroxide tanks were installed in the bomb bays to fuel the X-15 before launch. Its first flight with the X-15 was on 19 March 1959, with the first launch on 8 June 1959. The NB-52A, named [...] "The High and Mighty One" [...] carried the X-15 on 93 of the program's 199 flights.|$|E

2500|$|Balls 8 was {{originally}} an RB-52B that was first flown on June 11, 1955, and entered service with NASA on June 8, 1959. It was modified at North American Aviation's Palmdale facility to {{enable it to}} carry the X-15. As on its NB-52A predecessor, a pylon was installed beneath the right wing between the fuselage and the <b>inboard</b> <b>engines</b> with a [...] section removed from the wing flap to accommodate the X-15's tail.|$|E

2500|$|The wing was of NACA 23018 {{section at}} the root, {{and was a}} five-piece, all-metal, {{twin-spar}} structure. The untapered centre section carried the <b>inboard</b> <b>engines</b> and main undercarriage, while {{the inner and outer}} sections were tapered on their leading and trailing edges, with the inner sections carrying the outboard engines. The ailerons were fitted with trim and balance tabs, and there were hydraulically operated split flaps in three sections {{on each side of the}} trailing edges of the centre section and inner wings. A [...] fuel capacity was given by eight bag tanks, one on either side of the fuselage in the centre section and three in both inner wings.|$|E
2500|$|The Il-18 design {{had started}} in 1954 before the {{directive}} was issued and {{experience with the}} piston-engined Il-18 was used although the aircraft was a new design. The design was for a four-engined low-wing monoplane with a circular pressurised fuselage and a conventional tail. The forward retracting tricycle landing gear had four wheels fitted on the main leg bogies, the main legs bogies rotated 90 degrees and retracted into {{the rear of the}} <b>inboard</b> <b>engines.</b> A new feature at the time was the fitting of a weather radar in the nose {{and it was the first}} soviet airliner to have an automatic approach system. [...] The aircraft has two entry doors on the port-side before and after the wing and two overwing emergency exits on each side.|$|E

50|$|The airliner's four Curtiss Wright R-1820 radial engines used crankshaft-driven {{two-speed}} superchargers {{both for}} added power and for greater performance at altitude.

50|$|Auxiliary {{power was}} {{provided}} by an outboard motor mounted on the port quarter of the transom, a small well inboard of the transom allowed the motor to be tilted {{out of the water}} when not in use. Although some boats were fitted with a small single or twin cylinder <b>inboard</b> <b>engine</b> by retrofit.|$|R
25|$|On the Apollo 13 mission, the <b>inboard</b> <b>engine</b> {{suffered}} from major pogo oscillation, {{resulting in an}} early automatic cutoff. To ensure sufficient velocity was reached, the remaining four engines were kept active for longer than planned. A pogo suppressor was fitted to later Apollo missions to avoid this, though the early engine 5 cutoff remained to reduce g-forces.|$|R

5000|$|A {{modified}} version of the basic 880 was the [...] "-M" [...] version which incorporated four leading-edge slats per wing, Krueger leading-edge flaps between the fuselage and <b>inboard</b> <b>engines,</b> power-boosted rudder, added engine thrust, increased fuel capacity, stronger landing gear, greater adjustment to seating pitch, and a simpler overhead compartment arrangement.|$|E
50|$|Advantages to the <b>inboard</b> <b>engine</b> {{with a long}} {{driveshaft}} include {{keeping the}} engine relatively dry. Following the basic design pattern allows a variety of engines to be attached {{to a variety of}} different kinds of hulls.
