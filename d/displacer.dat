25|$|The {{gas volume}} {{in the engine}} {{increases}} and therefore the pressure reduces, which causes a pressure difference across the <b>displacer</b> rod to force the <b>displacer</b> towards the hot end. When the <b>displacer</b> moves, the piston is almost stationary and therefore the gas volume is almost constant. This step results in the constant volume cooling process, which reduces {{the pressure of the}} gas.|$|E
25|$|Design of {{the flat}} {{double-acting}} Stirling engine solves the drive of a <b>displacer</b> {{with the help of}} the fact that areas of the hot and cold pistons of the <b>displacer</b> are different.|$|E
25|$|Very {{low-power}} engines {{have been}} built that run on a temperature difference of as little as 0.5 K. A <b>displacer</b> type stirling engine has one piston and one <b>displacer.</b> A temperature difference is required between {{the top and bottom}} of the large cylinder to run the engine. In the case of the low-temperature difference (LTD) stirling engine, the temperature difference between one's hand and the surrounding air can be enough to run the engine. The power piston in the <b>displacer</b> type stirling engine is tightly sealed and is controlled to move up and down as the gas inside expands. The <b>displacer,</b> on the other hand, is very loosely fitted so that air can move freely between the hot and cold sections of the engine as the piston moves up and down. The <b>displacer</b> moves up and down to control the heating and cooling of the gas in the engine.|$|E
50|$|Later 'New Series' Moulton {{bicycles}} are {{fitted with}} rear suspensions systems marketed as 'Hydrolastic'. These are, in essence, miniaturised {{versions of the}} <b>displacers</b> used on Hydrolastic-equipped cars being a rubber cone spring with an internal fluid chamber to provide damping.|$|R
5|$|Prior to the battle, the Hellenes {{remembered the}} Dorians, an ethnic {{distinction}} which {{applied to the}} Spartans, as the conquerors and <b>displacers</b> of the Ionians in the Peloponnesus. After the battle, Spartan culture became an inspiration and object of emulation, a phenomenon known as Laconophilia.|$|R
40|$|Hyperbilirubinemia is {{frequently}} observed in neonates, and serious neurological complications such as kernicterus can be precipitated when {{the concentration of}} unconjugated bilirubin is abnormally increased. The administration of drugs which bind to albumin and compete with bilirubin can increase the possibility of such a complication. To test the bilirubin-displacing activity of pharmacological agents that are used with newborns, 52 antimicrobial agents were investigated in vitro. A glycine conjugate of salicylate, 2 -hydroxybenzoylglycine, which {{is known to be}} present at elevated levels in newborns and has a potent bilirubin-displacing property, was used as a positive control agent. Pooled cord serum was used as a source of hyperbilirubinemic serum. A centrifugal ultrafiltration method with semipermeable cones was employed {{to determine the effects of}} potential bilirubin-displacing agents on the levels of total bilirubin. 2 -Hydroxybenzoylglycine was demonstrated to be the most potent bilirubin-displacing agent. Antibiotics could be classified into four groups: high-level <b>displacers</b> (sulfisoxazole, sulfamethoxazole, dicloxacillin, cefoperazone, and ceftriaxone), intermediate-level <b>displacers</b> (moxalactam, nafcillin, and 14 others), low-level <b>displacers</b> (aztreonam, carbenicillin, and 11 others), and nondisplacers (mezlocillin, cefuroxime, kanamycin, and 15 others). It is concluded that the ultrafiltration method is a rapid and readily reproducible for the determination of bilirubin displacement and that antibiotics with a tendency to displace bilirubin should be avoided in jaundiced newborns whenever appropriate alternatives are available...|$|R
25|$|As the {{pressure}} increases, a point is reached where {{the pressure}} differential across the <b>displacer</b> rod becomes {{large enough to}} begin to push the <b>displacer</b> rod (and therefore also the <b>displacer)</b> towards the piston and thereby collapsing the cold space and transferring the cold, compressed gas towards the hot side in an almost constant volume process. As the gas arrives in the hot side the pressure increases and begins to move the piston outwards to initiate the expansion step as explained in (1).|$|E
25|$|Again, the {{following}} diagrams {{do not show}} any internal heat exchangers or a regenerator, which would {{be placed in the}} gas path around the <b>displacer.</b> If a regenerator is used in a beta engine, it is usually in the position of the <b>displacer</b> and moving, often as a volume of wire mesh.|$|E
25|$|The <b>displacer</b> is a {{special-purpose}} piston, used in Beta and Gamma type Stirling engines, to {{move the}} working gas {{back and forth between}} the hot and cold heat exchangers. Depending on the type of engine design, the <b>displacer</b> may or may not be sealed to the cylinder, i.e. it may be a loose fit within the cylinder, allowing the working gas to pass around it as it moves to occupy the part of the cylinder beyond.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} {{advance in}} the state of the art of displacement chromatography was the development of low molecular mass <b>displacers</b> for protein purification in ion exchange systems. This research was significant in that it represented a major departure from the conventional wisdom that large polyelectrolyte polymers are required to displace proteins in ion exchange systems.|$|R
50|$|Few Princesses {{are left}} in {{roadworthy}} condition. By the 1980s the Princess was outdated and practically valueless; most eventually went to the breakers yard or were dismantled for parts. <b>Displacers</b> for the Hydragas suspension system are now no longer manufactured, meaning that Princesses (and Austin Ambassadors) still on the road face a dwindling supply of this essential component.|$|R
50|$|A {{few seconds}} {{after the start of}} the SCRAM, a power spike occurred, and the core overheated, causing some of the fuel rods to fracture, {{blocking}} the control rod columns and jamming the control rods at one-third insertion, with the graphite <b>displacers</b> still in {{the lower part of the}} core. Within three seconds the reactor output rose above 530 MW.|$|R
25|$|Thermoacoustic {{devices are}} very {{different}} from Stirling devices, although the individual path travelled by each working gas molecule does follow a real Stirling cycle. These devices include the thermoacoustic engine and thermoacoustic refrigerator. High-amplitude acoustic standing waves cause compression and expansion analogous to a Stirling power piston, while out-of-phase acoustic travelling waves cause displacement along a temperature gradient, analogous to a Stirling <b>displacer</b> piston. Thus a thermoacoustic device typically does not have a <b>displacer,</b> as found in a beta or gamma Stirling.|$|E
25|$|A {{molecule}} {{with a high}} {{affinity for}} the chromatography matrix (the <b>displacer)</b> competes effectively for binding sites, and thus displace all molecules with lesser affinities.|$|E
25|$|When the <b>displacer</b> is in motion, the {{generator}} holds the working piston in the limit position, which brings the engine working cycle {{close to an}} ideal Stirling cycle.|$|E
5000|$|The German name G-Lader {{comes from}} {{the shape of the}} {{supercharger}} (Lader), which looks like the letter G. The <b>displacer's</b> spirals are either 40 mm deep or, in the larger version, 59.5 mm deep, i.e. close to 60 mm. This is the reason we see the engine designations G40 and G60 in the names of Volkswagen models in which it was used: ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: It is well {{established}} that salt enhances the in-teraction between solutes (e. g., proteins, <b>displacers)</b> and the weak hydrophobic ligands in hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) and that various salts (e. g., kosmo-tropes, chaotropes, and neutral) have different effects on protein retention. In this article, the solute affinity in kosmotropic, chaotropic, and neutral mobile phases are compared and the selectivity of solutes {{in the presence of}} these salts is examined. Since solute binding in HIC sys-tems is driven by the release of water molecules, the total number of released water molecules in the presence of various types of salts was calculated using the preferen-tial interaction theory. Chromatographic retention times and selectivity reversals of both proteins and <b>displacers</b> were found to be consistent with the total number of re-leased water molecules. Finally, the solute surface hydro-phobicity was also found to {{have a significant effect on}} its retention in HIC systems. B 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R
2500|$|A hybrid between piston and rotary {{configuration}} is {{a double}} acting engine. This design rotates the <b>displacers</b> {{on either side of}} the power piston. In addition to giving great design variability in the heat transfer area, this layout eliminates all but one external seal on the output shaft and one internal seal on the piston. Also, both sides can be highly pressurized as they balance against each other.|$|R
25|$|When the <b>displacer</b> is {{near the}} top of the large cylinder; inside the engine most of the gas has been heated by the heat source and it expands. This {{increases}} the pressure, which forces the piston up.|$|E
25|$|When the <b>displacer</b> is {{near the}} bottom of the large cylinder; most of the gas in the engine has now cooled and {{contracts}} causing the pressure to decrease, which in turn allows the piston to move down and compress the gas.|$|E
25|$|A beta Stirling has {{a single}} power piston {{arranged}} within the same cylinder on the same shaft as a <b>displacer</b> piston. The <b>displacer</b> piston is a loose fit and does not extract any power from the expanding gas but only serves to shuttle the working gas between the hot and cold heat exchangers. When the working gas is pushed to the hot end of the cylinder it expands and pushes the power piston. When it is pushed to the cold end of the cylinder it contracts and {{the momentum of the}} machine, usually enhanced by a flywheel, pushes the power piston the other way to compress the gas. Unlike the alpha type, the beta type avoids the technical problems of hot moving seals, as the power piston is not in contact with the hot gas.|$|E
5000|$|Steve Harper of MGA Developments {{produced}} the initial design concept in January 1991 (inspired by the Jaguar XJR-15 and the Ferrari 250LM), before Rover's in house design team refined the concept {{under the leadership}} of Gerry McGovern. An interesting feature of the F was its Hydragas suspension, a system employing interconnected fluid and gas <b>displacers</b> which provided a surprisingly compliant ride but which could be tuned to provide excellent handling characteristics.|$|R
40|$|The {{displacement}} of poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) from silica {{in two different}} solvents (water and dioxane) {{by a number of}} low molecular weight organic <b>displacers</b> was studied. The experimental data compare favorably with a theory developed in a previous paper. Using this theory we determined the segmental adsorption energy for PVP to be 4 kT, both in dioxane. and in water. This result is in good agreement with inferences from calorimetric and spectroscopic-bound fraction studies...|$|R
40|$|We realize {{quasi-periodic}} {{dynamics of}} a quantum walker over 2. 5 quasi-periods by realizing the walker {{as a single}} photon passing through a quantum-walk optical-interferometer network. We introduce fully controllable polarization-independent phase shifters in each optical path to realize arbitrary site-dependent phase shifts, and we employ large clear-aperture beam <b>displacers,</b> while maintaining high-visibility interference, to enable reaching 10 quantum-walk steps. By varying the half-wave-plate setting, we control the quantum-coin bias thereby observing a transition from quasi-periodic dynamics to ballistic diffusion. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
25|$|The gamma {{configuration}} has two cylinders: one {{containing a}} <b>displacer,</b> {{with a hot}} and a cold end, {{and one for the}} power piston; they are joined to form a single space with the same pressure in both cylinders; the pistons are typically in parallel and joined 90 degrees out of phase on a crankshaft.|$|E
25|$|The beta {{configuration}} has {{a single}} cylinder with a hot end and a cold end, containing a power piston and a 'displacer' that drives the gas between the hot and cold ends. It is typically used with a rhombic drive to achieve the phase difference between the <b>displacer</b> and power pistons, {{but they can be}} joined 90 degrees out of phase on a crankshaft.|$|E
25|$|A gamma Stirling {{is simply}} a beta Stirling in which the power piston is mounted in a {{separate}} cylinder alongside the <b>displacer</b> piston cylinder, but is still connected to the same flywheel. The gas in the two cylinders can flow freely between them and remains a single body. This configuration produces a lower compression ratio because {{of the volume of}} the connection between the two but is mechanically simpler and often used in multi-cylinder Stirling engines.|$|E
5000|$|However, the key {{improvement}} over conventional suspension {{is that the}} front/rear interconnection allows the vehicle to be stiffer in roll than in pitch. Hence {{it is possible to}} design a compliant suspension - giving a comfortable ride - without suffering a penalty in terms of excessive roll when cornering. In roll, there is no transference of fluid from the <b>displacers,</b> and hence its internal pressure rises. The only [...] "give" [...] in the suspension occurs because of the inherent flexibility of the rubber springs. These are naturally stiff.|$|R
40|$|We {{report an}} {{experimental}} {{implementation of a}} single-qubit generalised measurement scenario(POVM) based on a quantum walk model. The qubit is encoded in a single-photon polarisation. The photon performs a quantum walk on an array of optical elements, where the polarisation-dependent translation is performed via birefringent beam <b>displacers</b> and a change of the polarisation is implemented {{with the help of}} wave-plates. We implement: (i) Trine-POVM, i. e., the POVM elements uniformly distributed on an equatorial plane of the Bloch sphere; (ii) Symmetric-Informationally- Complete (SIC) POVM; and (iii) Unambiguous Discrimination of two non-orthogonal qubit states.

40|$|Abstract: In the oil industry, huge saving {{may be made}} if {{suitable}} multi-interface {{level measurement}} systems are employed for effectively monitoring crude oil separators and efficient control of their operation. A number of techniques, e. g. externally mounted <b>displacers,</b> differential pressure transmitters and capacitance rod devices, {{have been developed to}} measure the separation process with gas, oil, water and other components. Because of the unavailability of suitable multi-interface level measurement systems, oil separators are currently operated by the trial-and-error approach. In this paper some conventional techniques, which have been used for level measurement in industry, and new development are discussed...|$|R
25|$|The {{regenerator}} is the {{key component}} invented by Robert Stirling and its presence distinguishes a true Stirling engine from any other closed cycle hot air engine. Many small 'toy' Stirling engines, particularly low-temperature difference (LTD) types, {{do not have a}} distinct regenerator component and might be considered hot air engines; however a small amount of regeneration is provided by the surface of the <b>displacer</b> itself and the nearby cylinder wall, or similarly the passage connecting the hot and cold cylinders of an alpha configuration engine.|$|E
25|$|The reactor {{emergency}} {{protection system}} (EPS) {{was designed to}} shut down the reactor when its operational parameters are exceeded. The design accounted for steam collapse in the core when the fuel element temperature falls below 265°C, coolant vaporization in fuel channels in cold reactor state, and sticking of some emergency protection rods. However, the slow insertion speed of the control rods, together with their design causing localized positive reactivity as the <b>displacer</b> moves through {{the lower part of the}} core, created a number of possible situations where initiation of the EPS could itself cause or aggravate a reactor runaway.|$|E

Holonomies are the generalization of the Berry phases to unitary matrices with dimensionality {{the same as}} the degree of degeneracy of the system. In a nonlinear Kerr medium the degenerate states of laser beams are interpreted as qubits. Control manipulations with <b>displacers</b> squeezers and two-mode interfering devices performed in a cyclic, adiabatic fashion produce holonomies.

40|$|International audienceIn Stirling engines {{designed}} for continuous work conditions, clearance seals are usually used to avoid excessive wear and hence {{to extend the}} service life. This causes a gas leakage between the compression space and the expansion space through the <b>displacer's</b> clearance and also a gas leakage between the compression space and the bounce space through the power piston's clearance. In this study, we propose an unsteady analytical model to calculate the gas leakage mass flow rate by considering an oscillating flow in the annular clearance and to evaluate the power lost in both locations. Finally, the sensitivity to some relevant parameters is discussed...|$|R
