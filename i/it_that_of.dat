25|$|According to a {{tradition}} first {{recorded in the}} work of the 11th century Georgian chronicler Sumbat Davitis-Dze, and repeated much later by Prince Vakhushti Bagrationi (1696–1757) the dynasty claimed descent from the biblical king and prophet David and came from Palestine around 530 AD. The tradition had <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> seven refugee brothers of the Davidic line, three of them settled in Armenia and the other four arrived in Kartli (also known as Iberia), where they intermarried with the local ruling houses and acquired some lands in hereditary possession, with one of the four brothers, Guaram (died in 532), founding a line subsequently called Bagrationi after his son Bagrat. A successor, Guaram, was installed as a presiding prince of Kartli under the Byzantine protectorate, receiving on this occasion the Byzantine court title of Kouropalates in 575. Thus, according to this version, began the dynasty of the Bagratids, who ruled until 1801.|$|E

2500|$|The lengthy novel Huliganii ("The Hooligans") is {{intended}} as the fresco of a family, and, through <b>it,</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> an entire generation. The book's main protagonist, Petru Anicet, is a composer who places value in experiments; other characters include Dragu, who considers [...] "a hooligan's experience" [...] as [...] "the only fertile debut into life", and the totalitarian Alexandru Pleşa, {{who is on}} the search for [...] "the heroic life" [...] by enlisting youth in [...] "perfect regiments, equally intoxicated by a collective myth." [...] Călinescu thought that the young male characters all owed inspiration to Fyodor Dostoevsky's Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov (see Crime and Punishment). Anicet, who partly shares Pleșa's vision for a collective experiment, is also prone to sexual adventures, and seduces the women of the Lecca family (who have hired him as a piano teacher). Romanian-born novelist Norman Manea called Anicet's experiment: [...] "the paraded defiance of bourgeois conventions, in which venereal disease and lubricity dwell together." [...] In one episode of the book, Anicet convinces Anișoara Lecca to gratuitously steal from her parents—an outrage which leads her mother to moral decay and, eventually, to suicide. George Călinescu criticized the book for inconsistencies and [...] "excesses in Dostoyevskianism", but noted that the Lecca family portrayal was [...] "suggestive", and that the dramatic scenes were written with [...] "a remarkable poetic calm." ...|$|E
