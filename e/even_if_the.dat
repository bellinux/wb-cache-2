5|$|A batsman can be out lbw <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> ball did not hit his leg: for example, a batsman struck on {{the head}} could be lbw. However, he cannot be lbw if the ball pitches on the leg side of the stumps ("outside leg stump"), <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> ball would have {{otherwise}} hit the wickets. Similarly, a batsman who has attempted {{to hit the ball}} with his bat cannot be lbw if the ball strikes him outside the line of off stump. However, some shots in cricket, such as the switch hit or reverse sweep, involve the batsman switching between a right- and left-handed stance; this affects the location of the off and leg side, which are determined by the stance. The law explicitly states that the off side is determined by the batsman's position when the bowler commences his run-up.|$|E
5|$|But, the {{defendant}} {{does not have}} a right to a jury in stacked misdemeanor prosecutions, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> cumulative authorized imprisonment exceeds six months, as long as the actual sentence does not.

5|$|Careful {{selection}} of a spouse was important to maintain the royal status of a family: depending {{on the law of}} the land in question, if a prince or king was to marry a commoner who had no royal blood, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> first-born was acknowledged as a son of a sovereign, he might not be able to claim any of the royal status of his father.|$|E
5|$|Despite Brezhnev's {{failures}} in domestic reforms, his {{foreign affairs and}} defense policies turned the Soviet Union into a superpower.

5|$|Even {{though the}} cost of {{building}} TCF Bank Stadium originated at $248.7 million, changes in the construction planning raised the cost to $288.5 million.

5|$|In United States v. Hamilton (1883), the Court reaffirmed {{its earlier}} {{holdings}} that certificates could not issue from motions to quash an indictment. And, in United States v.

5|$|September 30, 2002: Arturo Martinez Tapia {{assaulted}} a Greyhound driver near Fresno, California, {{resulting in}} two passenger deaths after the bus then rolled off an embankment and crashed.
