40|$|In recent years, {{the world}} has become more sophisticated. Different aspects of today’s life has been digitized, this include; business, education, health, {{communication}} and numerous community services. With the existing extended coverage of cellular networks, most services are constantly deployed to be accessed via mobile phones, as {{they are also the}} most pervasive pocket carried devices. Though, both regular and smartphone can be used to convey the basics of mobile based services such as mobile banking, calling and text messaging, smartphone <b>goes</b> <b>extra</b> <b>mile.</b> While regular phones are still the better choice for some, smartphones are tremendously taking over the cellphone market. Smartphones are powered by the vast amount of mobile apps available today which offer unprecedented features and functionalities and as well more advanced internet connectivity. To ensure reliable, sufficient and safe water supply to public, the installed water points need to be well monitored. Quality and quantity parameters of water produced from the water points are constantly tracked to determine if they are within the acceptable range. In case of acute condition, the identified parameters need to be instantly communicated to the District Water Engineer (DWE) for prompt intervention. In this paper we explore the popularity and advantages of smartphones and present a proposed prototype that exploit the power of smartphones in real time monitoring of water points...|$|E
40|$|Online Social Networks (OSNs), such as Facebook, provide {{users with}} tools to share {{information}} along {{with a set of}} privacy controls preferences to regulate the spread of information. Current privacy controls are efficient to protect content data. However, the complexity of tuning them undermine their efficiency when protecting contextual information (such as the social network structure) that many users believe being kept private. In this paper, we demonstrate the extent of the problem of information leakage in Facebook. In particular, we show the possibility of inferring, from the network "surrounding" a victim user, some information that the victim set as hidden. We developed a system, named OSSINT (Open Source Social Network INTelligence), on top of our previous tool SocialSpy, that is able to infer hidden information of a victim profile and retrieve private information from public one. OSSINT retrieves the friendship network of a victim and shows how it is possible to infer additional private information (e. g., user personal preferences and hobbies). Our proposed system OSSINT <b>goes</b> <b>extra</b> <b>mile</b> about the network topology information, i. e., predicting new friendships using the victim's friends of friends network (2 -hop of distance from the victim profile), and hence possibly deduce private information of the full Facebook network. OSSINT correctly improved the previous results of SocialSpy predicting an average of 11 additional friendships with peaks of 20 new friends. Moreover, OSSINT, for the considered victim profiles demonstrated how it is possible to infer real life information such as current city, hometown, university, supposed being private...|$|E
