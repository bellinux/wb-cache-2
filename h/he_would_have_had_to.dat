5|$|The {{judge said}} there were three crucial points, in no {{particular}} order. Did the jury believe Julie Mugford or Jeremy Bamber? Were they sure that Sheila was not the killer who then committed suicide? He said this question involved another: was the second, fatal, shot fired at Sheila with the silencer on? If yes, {{she could not have}} fired it. Finally, did Nevill call Bamber {{in the middle of the}} night? If there was no such call, it undermined the entirety of Bamber's story; the only reason <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> invent the phone call was that he was responsible for the murders.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the idea}} of {{becoming}} a marine zoologist interested him, Franco had always secretly wanted to become an actor but feared being rejected. He enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) as an English major, but dropped out after his first year against his parents' wishes {{to pursue a career}} as an actor, since <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> wait two years to audition for their acting program. Franco instead chose to take acting lessons with Robert Carnegie at the Playhouse West. Around this time, Franco took up a late-night job at McDonald's to support himself because his parents refused to do so. He was a vegetarian until working there. While working at the establishment, he would practice accents on customers, an experience he remembered nostalgically in a 2015 Washington Post editorial ("McDonald’s was there for me when no one else was").|$|E
5|$|Like most flight {{instructors}} giving dual instruction, Reid {{was seated}} on the right side, while the aircraft's primary flight instruments were mounted on the left, in front of Dubroff in this case. Investigators speculated {{that because of the}} heavy rain in his immediate climb path, Reid's forward visibility became greatly restricted. To maintain control through the climbing right turn, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> turn his head to the left to see the flight instruments (most critically the attitude and airspeed indicators) and to the right to see the ground through the side window. Such side-to-side head motion, combined with the worsening flight visibility during the climb and the reduced stall margin, could have led to spatial disorientation and loss of control.|$|E
60|$|Had the {{corporal}} been {{invested with}} the proper authority <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> these raw recruits marshaled into ranks and forced to step in unison, carrying their muskets at the same angle, and otherwise conforming themselves to his idea of soldierly bearing--all this <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> them do; but whether he could <b>have</b> brought about such a condition of affairs is extremely problematical.|$|R

5|$|The {{release of}} Invincible {{was preceded by}} a dispute between Jackson and his record label, Sony Music Entertainment. Jackson had {{expected}} the licenses to the masters of his albums to revert to him {{some time in the}} early 2000s, after which {{he would be able to}} promote the material however he pleased and keep the profits; however, clauses in the contract set the revert date years into the future. Jackson discovered that the attorney who had represented him in the deal had also been representing Sony. He was also concerned that for years Sony had been pressuring him to sell his share in its music catalog venture; he feared that Sony might have had a conflict of interest, since if Jackson's career failed, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> sell his share of the catalog at a low price. Jackson sought an early exit from his contract.|$|E
5|$|Lehman {{played with}} the Millionaires until the 1925–26 season. During that time, Lehman {{and some of his}} {{teammates}} were involved in a humorous incident when going back to Canada after an exhibition game against the Montreal Wanderers in New York City. In New York, Lehman's wife bought numerous women's designer outfits, after being treated to a shopping spree by him. When going back to Canada, Lehman, on the advice of Cyclone Taylor, who was both a professional ice hockey player and a Canadian immigration officer, split up all outfits among his teammates to avoid paying additional taxes <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pay if he had brought all the clothing by himself at once; this puzzled the Customs officers. In 1922–23, the Millionaires were renamed the Maroons, and joined the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL). The WCHL was renamed to the Western Hockey League in 1925–26; however, the league disbanded at the conclusion of that season. While playing for the Millionaires, Lehman appeared in six Stanley Cup finals, losing every time, except in his first season, in 1914–15.|$|E
5|$|In {{the midst}} of his exile, Zardari had several {{different}} legal problems. In Pakistan, Musharraf granted him amnesty for his alleged offences through the National Reconciliation Ordinance, drafted in October 2007. However, the ordinance faced mounting public pressure and an uncompromising judiciary. In addition, it only dealt with charges up to 1999. This left open the possibility of investigations into his alleged involvement in about $2 million in illegal kickbacks to Saddam Hussein, discovered in October 2005, under the oil-for-food program. If the ordinance was rescinded, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> deal with charges relating to evading duties on an armoured BMW, commissions from a Polish tractor manufacturer, and a kickback from a gold bullion dealer. In Switzerland, Bhutto and Zardari appealed the 2003 Swiss conviction, which required the reopening of the case in October 2007. In November 2007, Swiss authorities returned the frozen $60 million to him through offshore companies because of the National Reconciliation Ordinance. In Spain, a criminal investigation was opened over the money laundering for the oil-for-food program because of the illicit profits handled through Spanish firms. In Britain, he was fighting a civil case against the Pakistani government for the proceeds from the liquidation sale of a Surrey mansion. He successfully used his medical diagnosis to postpone a verdict on his British manor trial.|$|E

25|$|Charles Cutler Torrey taught Semitic {{languages}} at Yale University. His lasting contribution {{has been}} to show how much more meaningful prophets, such as the scribe of Revelation, are when treated as poets first and foremost. He {{thought this was a}} point often lost sight of because most English bibles render everything in prose. Poetry was also the reason John never directly quoted the older prophets. Had he done so, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> use their (Hebrew) poetry whereas he wanted to write his own. Torrey insisted Revelation had originally been written in Aramaic.|$|E
25|$|Biblical scholar Michael D. Coogan {{discusses}} {{this as an}} inaccuracy regarding Mordecai's age. In the passage, either Mordecai or {{his great-grandfather}} Kish is identified as having been exiled from Jerusalem to Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar (in 597 BC). If this refers to Mordecai, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> live over a century to have witnessed the events described in the Book of Esther (assuming the biblical Ahasuerus is indeed Xerxes I). However, the verse may be read as referring not to Mordecai's exile to Babylon, but to his great-grandfather Kish's exile—a reading which many accept.|$|E

25|$|But {{he begged}} the Court's indulgence because under Kenosha v. Bruno, {{another one of}} the cases {{following}} Monroe, if the school district had the same Eleventh Amendment immunity as a municipality Doyle could not seek equitable relief such as his reinstatement against the board as an entity; <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do it against the members personally. If the case were remanded in its present state, he said, he would be unable to proceed even if he won on all the other issues. Since Congress had changed the federal-question statute since Bivens, he felt that created the implied cause of action from the enabling language in the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E
25|$|Filburn {{argued that}} since the excess wheat he {{produced}} was intended solely for home consumption, his wheat production could not be regulated through the Interstate Commerce Clause. The Supreme Court rejected this argument, reasoning that if Filburn had not used home-grown wheat, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> buy wheat on the open market. This effect on interstate commerce, the Court reasoned, may not be substantial from the actions of Filburn alone but, through the cumulative actions {{of thousands of other}} farmers just like Filburn, its effect would certainly become substantial. Therefore, Congress could regulate wholly intrastate, non-commercial activity if such activity, viewed in the aggregate, would have a substantial effect on interstate commerce, even if the individual effects are trivial.|$|E
25|$|In March 2012, Hogan {{announced}} he {{had signed a}} three-year contract to play for Glamorgan, the only Wales-based team in English county cricket. Western Australia's captain at the time, Marcus North, was Glamorgan's overseas player for the previous season, and recommended him to the team's coach, Matthew Mott. Qualifying for Glamorgan as the holder of British citizenship by descent (through his mother), Hogan was originally scheduled {{to play for the}} team {{in the last two months}} of the 2012 English season, but a change in Cricket Australia regulations meant <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> play any Australian domestic matches as an overseas player. He decided to postpone playing for Glamorgan until the 2013 English season, thus retaining eligibility to play as a non-overseas player for the remainder of the season in Australia. In July 2012, Hogan re-signed with the Hobart Hurricanes.|$|E

25|$|On February 2, 2009, Politico and CNN {{reported}} that Gregg accepted President Obama's offer {{to be the}} next United States Secretary of Commerce. If Gregg had been confirmed by the Senate, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> resign his Senate seat and be replaced with an appointment by Democratic Governor John Lynch. Sources from both parties confirmed that Gregg's former chief of staff, Republican Bonnie Newman, would have been chosen to replace him. The Washington Post had alleged that Gregg would not accept the appointment unless Gov. Lynch agreed to appoint a Republican to fill his seat until 2010. In February 2009 many news outlets noted that Gregg had, in 1995, voted to abolish the United States Department of Commerce. Although he has stated that he supports the stimulus package promoted by President Obama, he has stated that he will recuse himself from voting on the package.|$|E
25|$|The ninth match, and {{the main}} match in the undercard, was between Totally Buffed (Lex Luger and Buff Bagwell) and Goldberg with DeWayne Bruce in a No Disqualification tag-team match, where if Goldberg lost <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> retire. The match started out with Goldberg against Bagwell, where Goldberg had full control of the match. Bruce was then tagged in by Goldberg where he gained an early {{advantage}} over Bagwell for a short time, but was then double teamed by Totally Buffed. Goldberg was then tagged in, where Bagwell gained the upper-hand. Luger then exited the ring and walked up to a fan, who asked for Goldberg's autograph earlier in the event. This distracted and lured Goldberg near the fan, who sprayed mace into Goldberg's eyes. Luger then lifted Goldberg on his shoulders and Bagwell hit a Super Blockbuster. Luger covered him for the victory, thus ending Goldberg's undefeated streak of thirty-five victories and forcing Goldberg to retire from professional wrestling.|$|E

Needing at least eight wins to preserve his rank in the Kyushu tournament in November, he instead had to withdraw once again on Day 3 after injuring a thigh muscle, and was demoted back to sekiwake. Needing ten wins in the January 2013 tournament, he lost his chance of an immediate return to ōzeki on Day 13 when he fell to his sixth defeat. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> win 32 or 33 bouts in three consecutive tournaments in makuuchi to earn promotion to ōzeki again. Because he sat out the summer tournament 2013 due to injury, he was demoted to the jūryō division in September 2013 and chose to retire on September the 11th.|$|E

25|$|At Lockdown, Joe {{defeated}} Angle to win {{his first}} TNA World Championship and become TNA's third Triple Crown Champion. The stipulation of the match was if Joe had lost, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> retire from professional wrestling. He defeated Angle in a rematch on Impact! and then retained against Scott Steiner and Kaz at Sacrifice. At Slammiversary, Joe became the first champion to ever retain his title in a King of the Mountain match. Joe was then challenged to a match by Booker T at Victory Road, which he accepted. At Victory Road the match went to a No Contest when Sting hit Joe {{with a baseball bat}} and Booker pinned him while Sharmell made the three count. At Hard Justice, Joe defeated Booker after a guitar shot, thus reclaiming physical possession of the title belt, which Booker had kept after Victory Road. At Bound for Glory IV, he fought Sting in a losing effort to defend the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, ending his reign at 182 days.|$|E
25|$|Belaney enlisted {{with the}} Canadian Overseas Expeditionary Force (CEF) on May 6, 1915 during the First World War. His Regimental number with the CEF was 415259. On his {{attestation}} papers, {{he claimed to}} be born in Montreal on September 18, 1888, and listed no next of kin. When asked about his marital status, it appears some confusion may have occurred; the word 'yes' was written and then crossed out, then the word 'no' was written and crossed out, leaving his marital status unclear to the military {{at the time of}} enlistment. He stated his trade was a 'trapper' and that he previously served as a 'Mexican Scout' with the 28th Dragoons, although this is unclear since the U.S. was not in any significant military actions in the region (other than small operations, in which he could not have served; <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> serve between 1904 and 1915). Belaney joined the 13th (Montreal) Battalion of the Black Watch. His unit was shipped to France, where he served as a sniper. His comrades accepted his self-presentation as Indian and generally praised his conduct. Belaney was wounded in January 1916, and then more seriously on April 24, 1916, with a shot through the foot. When the wounded limb developed gangrene, Belaney was shipped to Britain for treatment.|$|E
