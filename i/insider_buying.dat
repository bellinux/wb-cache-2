It includes various qualitative judgments regarding {{the competence of}} current and prospective company management, as well as issues related to <b>insider</b> <b>buying,</b> future strategies to increase operations and market share. Most large companies compensate executives {{through a combination of}} cash, restricted stock and options. It is a positive sign when members of management are also shareholders. When management makes large purchases of their own stock with private funds, it may indicate that management insiders feel the company is undervalued, or that a favorable company event will occur soon. Another way {{to get a feel for}} management capability is to examine how executives performed at other companies in the past. Warren Buffett has several recommendations for investors who want to evaluate a company’s management as a precursor to possible investment in that company’s stock. For example, he advises that one way to determine if management is doing a good job is to evaluate the company's return on equity, instead of their earnings per share (the portion of a company’s profit allocated to each outstanding share of common stock). [...] "The primary test of managerial economic performance is achievement of a high earnings rate on equity capital employed (without undue leverage, accounting gimmickry, etc.) and not the achievement of consistent gains in earnings per share." [...] Buffett notes that because companies usually retain a portion of their earnings, the assets a profitable company owns should increase annually. This additional cash allows the company to report increased earnings per share even if their performance is deteriorating. He also emphasizes investing in companies with a management team that is committed to controlling costs. Cost-control is reflected by a profit margin exceeding those of competitors. Superior managers [...] "attack costs as vigorously when profits are at record levels as when they are under pressure". Therefore, be wary of companies that have opulent corporate offices, unusually large corporate staffs and other signs of bloat. Additionally, Buffett suggests investing in companies with honest and candid management, and avoiding companies that have a history of using accounting gimmicks to inflate profits or have misled investors in the past.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of my two}} essays together is to examine whether the trades made by the insiders prior to open market repurchase (OMR) announcements contain {{information that can be}} used to identify the repurchases that are motivated by undervaluation. The existing literature on shares repurchases suggests that while undervaluation has been a dominant motive behind repurchases for past few decades, identifying these undervalued firms still remains a challenge. The book-to-market ratio is commonly used as a proxy for mispricing; however, its ability to identify undervalued repurchasing firms has recently come into doubt (Chan et al., 2004). Instead, I propose using proxies based on insider trading to identify the undervalued repurchasing firms. In the first essay, I document a relation between insider trading and both the short- and long-run stock returns of open market repurchasing firms. My findings suggest that the personal trades made by insiders prior to the OMR announcements contain information {{that can be used to}} identify undervalued repurchasing firms. I use various measures of insider trading and show that firms with high (low) <b>insider</b> <b>buying</b> (selling) prior to repurchase announcements earn abnormal stock returns in both the short- and long-run. I also find a positive (negative) relation between <b>insider</b> <b>buying</b> (selling) and the actual repurchasing activity of the firms. In my second essay, I further test whether the trades made by insiders prior to OMR announcements contain information that can be used to identify the repurchases that are motivated by undervaluation by examining the post-announcement operating performance. I find a relation between insider trading and the post-announcement operating performance for the OMR firms that is consistent with the hypothesis that insiders' trades prior to OMR announcements are informative. Specifically, I find that firms with high <b>insider</b> <b>buying</b> prior to the OMR announcements outperform their corresponding control firms, whereas, firms with low <b>insider</b> <b>buying</b> do not. In addition, I test for a relation between insider trading and (a) the accruals management around OMR announcements, and (b) the market reaction to the earnings announcements made by the OMR firms. I find a weak evidence of insiders timing their trades along with accruals management. However, the market reaction to earnings announcements made by the OMR firms does not seem to vary with level of insider trading. Overall, the evidence is consistent with insiders of repurchasing firms knowing when their stocks are undervalued and they timing both their personal and firm level trades accordingly...|$|E

40|$|The informational role of {{strategic}} insider trading around corporate dividend announcements is studied {{based on the}} efficient equilibrium in a signaling model with endogenous insider trading. Insider trading immediately prior to the announcement of dividend initiations has significant explanatory power. For firms with insider selling prior to the dividend initiation announcement, the excess returns are negative and significantly lower than for the remaining firms (with no insider trading or just <b>insider</b> <b>buying)</b> as implied by the authors' model. Another implication is that dividend increases may elicit a positive or negative stock price response depending on the firm's investment opportunities.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{numerous}} studies have debated the usefulness of insider trading. One particularly important study relates to the informational role that insiders’ transaction volumes have on trading activity in the equity market. In our paper, we examine whether insiders’ purchases (sales) indicate positive (negative) earnings announcements. We argue that if insiders have early access to publicly announced information, then the issuance of good (bad) news should be preceded by <b>insider</b> <b>buying</b> (selling) activities. The results reveal that insiders’ trading volume {{play an important role}} in the dissemination of private information to the investing public. In particular, insiders’ purchases (sales) are found to be a good indication of good (bad) news.

40|$|There is {{substantial}} evidence that insider trading is present around corporate announcements {{and that this}} insider trading is motivated by private information. Using {{real estate investment trusts}} that choose to reappraise themselves as our sample, we establish that the appraisals contain information, but find no market response to the public announcement of this information in these appraisals. We consider two possible explanations for this inconsistency: the first that the appraisal information is not highlighted in earnings reports and hence remains unobserved; and the second that insiders trade on the appraisal information in the time that elapses between the appraisal and its public announcement We find strong support for the second hypothesis, with insiders buying (selling) after they receive favorable (unfavorable) appraisal news, especially for negative appraisals.

The analysis of individual trades shows that insiders sell when their IPO reaches its optimal value as the excess returns are positive in the pre-event and not significant in the post-event period.

40|$|This paper {{documents}} significant trading by insiders {{around a}} first-time debt covenant violation disclosure in an SEC filing and is interesting from {{a research and}} regulatory standpoint because of three considerations - delay and relative infrequency of new covenant violation disclosures {{lack of attention to}} disclosure issues by regulators and dearth of research. Importantly we find a lead relation between net insider selling in the 12 months before a debt covenant violation disclosure and investors' negative returns and net <b>insider</b> <b>buying</b> up to 12 months after disclosure and investors' positive returns. This relation is robust to the presence of other information. These results support our contention that insiders' trades around a covenant violation disclosure may benefit from an information advantage unavailable to other market participants.

40|$|The present paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} whether corporate insiders time their trades when asymmetric information between insiders and out-siders is high. Using data on corporate insider transactions in the U. S. between 1993 and 2008, we analyze the relationship between asymmetric information and the likelihood of insider trading. Our proxy for asymmet-ric information is a firm’s idiosyncratic return volatility shortly prior to the point in time considered relative to its recent mean. Our findings indi-cate that this measure positively affects the likelihood of insider purchases, which indicates that <b>insiders</b> <b>buy</b> shares when their informational advan-tage is high. However, the likelihood of an insider sale is, on average, not related to changes in asymmetric information. We also analyze long-term performance of insider trades to investigate whether timing is profitable. According to our results, insiders can generate significantly higher abnormal returns for insider purchases when they trade during periods of relatively high idiosyncratic volatility...|$|R

40|$|This study empirically {{examines}} {{the relation between}} reportable insider trading and the information captured by annual unexpected earnings for a large sample of firms, spanning a ten-year period (1978 [...] 87). Each observation is {{assigned to one of}} four groups based on the direction of net insider trading (Buy, Sell) and the sign (+, -) of unexpected earnings. For each of these groups, 15 -month cumulative abnormal returns are regressed on annual unexpected earnings. The slope coefficient is the largest for the group where insiders are net purchasers and the sign of unexpected earnings is positive. This is consistent with an inference that <b>insider</b> <b>buying</b> interactively confirms the favorable information captured by positive unexpected earnings and this interaction reduces the noise in unexpected earnings. The result with regard to the unfavorable information captured by the group with insider selling and negative unexpected earnings is similar but less pronounced. The analysis also suggests that insider trading conveys information not fully captured by the year's earnings. reportable insider trading, additive effect, interactive effect, earnings response coefficient...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{examines}} three {{hypotheses about}} the effect of insider trading on the market response to new financing announcements (NFAs) using a sample of disclosures made by UK firms between 1989 and 1991. The study demonstrates first that no systematic relationships exist between the market response to NFAs and pre-announcement insider trading. Second, contrary to the predictions of John and Mishra (1990), the values of growth indicators do not differ significantly between firms that are subject to <b>insider</b> <b>buying</b> and selling prior to NFAs. Third, while there is some evidence to suggest that insider trading and growth prospects influence the market reaction to debt issue announcements, the evidence is not pervasive across growth measures and does not extend to equity issues. This final result helps to resolve an apparent contradiction between the signalling models of John and Mishra (1990), and John and Lang (1991), and suggests that prior studies of the market reaction to NFAs are not significantly flawed by their failure to consider the signalling role of pre-announcement insider trading. The findings are also shown to be relevant to the current debate about whether, and how, insider trading regulations should be tightened. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{argue that}} insiders' {{decisions}} {{to trade in}} short windows before news announcements are likely to result from a trade-off between the incentives {{to capitalize on the}} foreknowledge of the disclosure and the risk of regulatory scrutiny and lost reputation. We provide evidence that <b>insider</b> <b>buying</b> is driven by the trade-off, while selling is primarily influenced by the deterring effect of the regulatory and reputation risks. We show that insiders strategically choose the amount of shares bought ahead of good news announcements. They increase their purchases as the price impact of the news goes up, but we find that the amount of shares purchased levels off as the news becomes extreme. In contrast, we find that the probability of insider selling significantly decreases with the price impact of the forthcoming bad news. To further support our arguments on the importance of incentives and disincentives to trade, we show that the strategic trading is mainly observed in the most price-sensitive groups of news announcements, it is clearly pronounced for best informed executives (CEOs), and that trading patterns change with changes in regulations, and insiders with higher reputation at risk limit their trading ahead of bad news. insider trading, private information, information disclosure, regulation...|$|E
