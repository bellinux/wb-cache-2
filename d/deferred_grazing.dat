5000|$|August Ludwig [...] "Gus" [...] Hormay (1907-1999) {{developed}} and applied {{the concept of}} the rest-rotation grazing management system in areas of the Western United States. Rest-rotation rangeland management system uses <b>deferred</b> <b>grazing</b> to manage increased plant reproduction and maintenance, while providing grazing lands for both livestock and wildlife. Gus Hormay's rest-rotation management system was developed to increase a healthy plant community, watershed, soil and wildlife habitat, {{while at the same time}} increasing livestock production. It has been in use in various forms since the mid-1960s as a rangeland management tool.|$|E
50|$|Grazing (especially, overgrazing) may detrimentally affect certain {{wildlife}} species, e.g. {{by altering}} cover and food supplies. However, habitat modification by livestock grazing can also benefit some wildlife species. For example, in North America, various {{studies have found}} that grazing sometimes improves habitat forelk,blacktailed prairie dogs,sage grouse,mule deer,and numerous other species. A survey of refuge managers on 123 National Wildlife Refuges in the US tallied 86 species of wildlife considered positively affected and 82 considered negatively affected by refuge cattle grazing or haying. Such mixed effects suggest that wildlife diversity may be enhanced and maintained by grazing livestock in some places while excluding livestock in some places. The kind of grazing system employed (e.g. rest-rotation, <b>deferred</b> <b>grazing,</b> HILF grazing) is often important in achieving grazing benefits for particular wildlife species.|$|E

40|$|Wool {{production}} can {{be highly}} profitable if {{attention is paid to}} the key profit drivers. Producers are often presented with recommendations for management that are promoted as “best practice”, without reference to their impact on the profitability of their grazing enterprise as a whole. It is not usually feasible for a producer to evaluate the benefits for and risks to their business of a management option by means of a long-term controlled on-farm trial. This paper demonstrates the use of the decision support tool, GrassGroTM (Moore et al., 1997) to help assess a recommendation to <b>defer</b> <b>grazing</b> of annual pastures in autumn for a fine wool Merino breeding flock in a Mediterranean environment. Autumn deferment was investigated for 3 periods between April and July at stocking rates of 3 – 11 ewes/ha. Deferment substantially increased pasture production, relative to continuous grazing, only when it was implemented after 1 June in good seasons, when it was least required. The amount of additional pasture from deferment was greater at higher stocking rates. At all stocking rates tested, deferment resulted in less risk but lower mean gross margins than continuous grazing because animal production was reduced or feed costs were higher. Deferment after 1 June coincided with late pregnancy and it was more costly to maintain ewe condition. On the south coastal sandplain of WA, which experiences erratic rainfall, there was much greater potential to improve returns by increasing stocking rate targets rather than by implementing autumn deferment...|$|R

40|$|This NebFact {{addresses}} how to {{deal with}} an inadequate supply of forage for range beef cattle because of drought. Precipitation can be below average for much of the Nebraska Panhandle and adjoining areas for prolonged periods. Prolonged drought results in an inadequate supply of forage {{for hundreds of thousands of}} beef cattle on millions of acres of rangeland. While some variation occurs among ranches and among pastures within a given ranch, all rangeland vegetation in arid environments like western Nebraska can be moderately to severely damaged by drought stress and/or excessive grazing. Consequently, even if soil moisture is not limited in the years following a drought, spring growth rate will be reduced and total annual forage production can be 20 to 50 percent below average on millions of acres of rangeland. Growth of below-ground plant parts in grasses is proportional to the amount of top growth each year. Combinations of drought-limited plant growth and/or excessive livestock grazing have dramatically reduced root growth, levels of stored energy, and formation of buds needed for future-year tillers. Stocking rates following drought must be reduced at least 20 to 50 percent compared to long-term average pair-days per acre because a larger percentage of the drought year 2 ̆ 7 s plant growth should remain ungrazed to improve the effectiveness of precipitation. In the long run, it will be most cost effective to <b>defer</b> <b>grazing</b> in severely damaged pastures for a full growing season, until after a killing frost or until the following summer. Failure to delay turnout and reduce stocking rates in the year following a drought would be a serious tactical mistake for long-term ranch survival...|$|R

40|$|Objetivou-se avaliar o efeito dos períodos de diferimento e de pastejo sobre a densidade populacional de perfilhos, a massa dos componentes morfológicos da forragem e o índice de tombamento em pastagens de Brachiaria decumbens cv. Basilisk. Dois ensaios foram conduzidos: o primeiro denominado ano 1 e, o segundo, ano 2. Adotou-se o esquema de parcelas subdivididas, segundo o delineamento em blocos casualizados, com duas repetições para cada combinação dos períodos de diferimento da pastagem com os períodos de pastejo. No ano 1, os períodos de diferimento foram 103, 121, 146 e 163 dias; e no ano 2, foram 73, 103, 131 e 163 dias. Os períodos de pastejo foram 1, 29, 57 e 85 dias. O aumento do período de diferimento elevou a densidade populacional de perfilhos reprodutivos (ano 2 : de 37 para 304 perfilhos/m²) e reduziu a de perfilhos vegetativos (ano 1 : de 1. 253 para 889 perfilhos/m²; ano 2 : de 1. 235 para 627 perfilhos/m²). Durante o período de pastejo, ocorreu diminuição no número de perfilhos vegetativo (ano 1 : de 988 para 868 perfilhos/m²) e reprodutivo (ano 1 : de 216 para 0 perfilhos/m²; ano 2 : de 203 para 0 perfilhos/m²) e aumento no número de perfilhos mortos (ano 1 : 463 para 1. 088 perfilhos/m²; ano 2 : de 341 para 1. 010 perfilhos/m²). Pastagens sob maiores períodos de diferimento e de pastejo apresentaram maior massa de colmo morto (6. 093 e 3. 819 kg/ha de MS nos anos 1 e 2, respectivamente) e menor massa de lâmina foliar verde (341 e 177 kg/ha de MS nos anos 1 e 2, respectivamente). Pastos de Brachiaria decumbens cv. Basilisk, submetidos a longos períodos de diferimento e de pastejo possuem características estruturais desfavoráveis à produção animal. This worked {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effects of <b>deferring</b> and <b>grazing</b> periods on the tiller population density, morphological component mass of forage and falling index on Brachiaria decumbens cv. Basilisk pastures. Two assays were carried out: first year and second year. Subdivided plots were used according to a randomized block design with two replicates. The treatments were composed of combinations of <b>deferred</b> periods and <b>grazing</b> periods. In the first year, 103, 121, 146 and 163 -day deferring periods were used; and 73, 103, 131 and 163 -day deferring periods in the second year. The grazing periods were 1, 29, 57 and 85 days. The increase in the deferring period increased the population density of reproductive tillers (from 37 to 304 tillers/m² in the second year) and reduced the density of vegetative tillers (from 1, 253 to 889 tillers/m² {{in the first year}}; from 1, 235 to 627 tillers/m² in the second year). Throughout the grazing period, decrease in the vegetative (from 988 to 868 tillers/m² in the first year) and reproductive tillers (from 216 to 0 tillers/m² in the first year; from 203 to 0 tillers/m² in the second year) occurred, as well as increase in dead tillers (from 463 to 1, 088 tillers/m² in the first year and from 341 to 1, 010 tillers/m² in the second year).

The aerial tiller possessed lower rates of leaf senescence, of leaf elongation and of stem elongation, as well as lower number of dead leaf and stem and leaf lamina lengths, compared to basal tiller. The leaf lifespan was higher in aerial tillers than at basal. The basal tiller also contributed to higher rates of tissue growth and forage accumulation in pasture when compared to aerial tiller.

40|$|Short-duration {{rotation}} grazing was compared with <b>deferred</b> <b>grazing</b> in a 3 -year experiment at ICRISAT, Niger. Short-duration grazing used a mixed herd (2 steers, 4 sheep and 4 goats) and cycles of 15 - 21 {{days in the}} wet season and 91 days in the dry season. Wet season grazing compared high (83 - 126 kg W/ha) and moderate (35 - 37 kg W/ha) stocking rates. In the second grazing system, the paddocks were ungrazed in the wet season and grazed in the dry season in 2 cycles of 91 days with a herd {{twice as large as}} in short-duration {{rotation grazing}}, such that overall stocking rates in the 2 systems were similar. Herbage yields were related to annual rainfall, with grazing having limited effect on yield. In 1996, herbage production under short-duration rotation grazing was greater than under protection (+ 31 percent) or <b>deferred</b> <b>grazing</b> (+ 9 percent), but this was reversed with poor rains in 1997. Range condition in 1996 showed that moderate stocking rate favours grasses over dicots and results in more palatable herbage.

40|$|Abstract. Forage cereals {{offer the}} {{potential}} {{to increase the amount}} of forage grown and consumed on dairy farms in southern Australia. The effect of single or multiple grazing of winter cereal forages by lactating dairy cattle on dry matter (DM) yield and nutritive value at grazing and on subsequent silage production harvested at the soft-dough stage of growth was determined in three studies in south-western Victoria. In the first two studies, a range of forage cereals and an annual ryegrass were grazed either once (G 1) during tillering (GS 21 – 29), followed by locking up for silage, grazed twice (G 2) (GS 21 – 29 and GS 32 – 34), followed by locking up for silage, or not grazed (NG) and harvested for silage only. In the third study, two forage cerealswere either ungrazed (NG) or grazed at eitherGS 21,GS 24,GS 30 orGS 32 and subsequently locked up and harvested for silage. All silage harvests occurred at GS 84 (soft dough). In all studies, grazing at early tillering resulted inDMyieldof less than 1. 4 tDM/ha, although crudeprotein (CP) (30 – 37 %DM) andestimatedmetabolisable energy (ME) (12. 2 – 14 MJ/kg DM) were high. <b>Deferring</b> <b>grazing</b> until the start of stem elongation resulted in higher DM yields (1. 8 – 4. 3 t DM/ha).

40|$|The {{origin of}} native midwestern {{pastures}} from virgin prairie and the degeneration {{of the prairie}} under long-continued grazing have been outlined in some detail in a previous bulletin (Weaver 2 ̆ 6 Hansen 1941). During {{the last four years}} much study has been given to the converse phenomenon of the regeneration of native midwestern pastures when grazing animals were excluded. This universal phenomenon of the return of vegetation to something of its former natural condition is summed up in the term plant succession (Clements 1928). In connection with pastures derived from true prairie, it is of great practical as well as scientific importance, since no pasture at any stage in the degeneration of true prairie produces continuously so great an amount of highly nutritious forage as do the native bluestem grasses. Recognition of this fact has led to such practices as <b>deferring</b> <b>grazing</b> in bluestem pastures until late spring or early summer, but few or no studies {{have been made in the}} true-prairie area to determine the rate of regeneration of the better grasses in pastures already dominated by species of lower forage value. Much work has been done in the more arid ranges in the western United States (Sampson 1919; Campbell 1931, 1940; Whyte 1939). This study falls naturally into two phases or parts.

The original plans have been considerably extended and continued through a period of four years. The second part, executed in 1939 and 1940, has to do with relative production of forage in pastures protected from grazing during a first, second, and fourth year, and of native prairie.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to understand how the strategy of defoliation prior to <b>deferred</b> <b>grazing</b> modifies the structure of Brachiaria brizantha cv. marandu (marandu grass) at the beginning of deferment. The following three defoliation strategies wer e evaluated: 15 / 15 cm – canopy height of 15 cm in the three months prior to deferment; 30 / 15 cm – canopy height of 30 cm in the preceding three months and defoliation to 15 cm at the beginning of deferment; 45 / 15 cm – canopy height of 45 cm in the three preceding months and defoliation to 15 cm at the beginning of deferment. A complete randomized design with four replications was used. When compared to the 30 / 15 and 45 / 15 cm canopies, the 15 / 15 cm canopy exhibited a larger number of tillers (P< 0. 0001), especially tillers with apical meristem (P= 0. 0004), as well as a higher forage mass (P= 0. 0071), percentage of leaves (P= 0. 0005), extended plant height (P= 0. 0304), horizontality index (P= 0. 011), and remnant leaf area index (P< 0. 0001) after defoliation to 15 cm. On the other hand, higher canopies (30 / 15 cm and 45 / 15 cm) had a greater tiller weight (P= 0. 0399), percentage of live stems (P< 0. 0001), dead stems (P= 0. 0049) and dead leaves (P< 0. 0077), and leaf litter mass (P= 0. 0028) after defoliation.

40|$|Clearing {{of trees}} from the {{so-called}} caatinga woodland {{that characterizes the}} vegetation of the semi-arid region of northeast Brazil offers possibilities for increasing forage production. This research analyzed the first-year effects of clearing caatinga on dry season forage for goats and sheep. In addition, factors affecting litter decomposition on cleared and uncleared caatinga were assessed to evaluate the viability of <b>deferring</b> <b>grazing</b> of forages during the wet season for use later in the dry season. Removing the trees resulted in a sixfold increase in production of herbaceous vegetation, however, 88 percent of the increased yield on the cleared areas was {{in the form of}} stems from herbaceous vegetation. Seventy-two percent of the stems were unpalatable to goats and sheep because of the massive size of those stems. Leaf litter from trees was {{an important component of the}} diets of goats and sheep during the dry season and clearing reduced production of this forage threefold. Clearing resulted in increased decomposition of leaf litter. Changes in microclimate played only a minor role in this difference. The reduction in the amount of leaf litter from trees relative to litter from herbs had the greatest effect on decomposition rates of dry season forage because tree litter decomposed less rapidly than did herbaceous litter. The slow decomposition of leaf litter during the dry season suggests that deferment. of cleared or uncleared caatinga for use as forage in the latter part of the dry season is feasible. An analysis of the diets of esophageally fistulated goats and sheep indicated that clearing may be a viable alternative for improving the amount and the in vitro dry matter digestibility of the forage consumed during the dry season the first-year post-treatment. These increases were attributed to an absolute greater abundance of preferred herbaceous forages (i. e., foliage and leaf litter) and to the persistent green foliage on coppicing woody plants. Dietary nitrogen appeared to limit intake, and clearing did not improve availability of this nutrient to sheep and goats at the higher levels of grazing pressure applied in this study. Other ecosystem considerations such as watershed protection and long-term community stability must also be considered in decisions to remove the tree canopy of the caatinga...|$|R

The grazing season lasted from June 20 to October 10 of each year. Cows equipped with esophageal fistulas were used to evaluate diet quality and diet botanical composition. Yearling heifers were used to evaluate livestock performance. The weight estimate method combined with a double sampling technique was used to estimate forage production. Utilization estimates were made by employing {{the use of the}} ocular-estimate-by-average-of- plants method. Grass was the most important forage class in cattle diets among the three systems. Grasses made up 67. 7 percent of cattle diets on the season-long and rest-rotation grazing systems when data were pooled across systems, periods, and years. Forbs and shrubs contributed 19. 7 percent and 11. 6 percent of the diet, respectively. Area collected and vegetation structure appear to influence the percent by weight of important species found in the diets of cattle among the systems. More grasses were consumed in the season-long system during early summer of 1979 than in the rest-rotation grazing system. Forb consumption decreased from 32. 0 percent by weight to 8. 1 percent as the grazing season advanced. Shrub consumption totalled only 13. 4 and 17. 5 percent during early summer and late summer, respectively. Crude protein, acid detergent fiber, lignin, and cellulose values of diet samples were not significantly different among the systems when data were pooled across years and periods. Although values for in vitro dry matter digestibility were different among the three systems, differences were not great enough to change animal performance. Livestock performance data trends were very consistent with diet quality data trends. However, livestock performance was significantly different among the grazing systems when data were pooled across years and periods even though there was little difference in diet quality among the systems. Average daily gains were 0. 51, 0. 61 and 0. 65 kg for the rest-rotation, season-long, and <b>deferred</b> rotation <b>grazing</b> systems. Animals gained significantly more in deferred rotation than in the other two systems. Cattle gained significantly less in rest-rotation than cattle in season-long when data were pooled over years and periods. When spring rainfall was highest in 1980, production was greatest.

During drought periods, livestock managers should use lighter stock-ing rates or <b>deferred</b> <b>grazing</b> to ensure rapid recovery of all prairie plants, including P. oklahomensis, once the drought ends. This recommendation would likely sustain prairie sites during long-term (longer than 10 years) droughts as well...|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} Trial 1 to determine effects of summer grazing date and fall grazing pressure on the CP content and in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD) of the diets of cows grazing fall range in the Nebraska Sandhills. In both experiments, pastures were grazed in June, July, or <b>deferred</b> from summer <b>grazing.</b> The pastures were then grazed the following fall at various levels of grazing pressure, and diets were collected by esophageally fistulated cows as forage was removed. In the first experiment, pastures grazed in June had higher diet CP in the fall than pastures grazed in July. Diet CP and IVOMD declined quadratically with increased grazing pressure. In the second experiment, pastures <b>deferred</b> from summer <b>grazing</b> had higher CP content than pastures grazed in June or July. Fall diet CP and IVOMD did not decline with increased grazing pressure. ^ Trial 2 was conducted {{to determine the effects}} of supplementing pregnant heifers (March-calving) grazing winter range to meet metabolizable protein (MP) requirements versus CP requirements on forage intake and production traits, and to determine effects of hay supplementation during the last two months of gestation. Heifer body weight and body condition score change during the winter were not markedly different between MP and CP supplemented heifers, but hay supplementation reduced body weight and condition score loss. Grazed forage intake was not affected by treatment, but intake declined from November through February. ^ Trial 3 was conducted to determine effects of supplementing pregnant heifers to meet MP or CP requirements on 2 -yr-old pregnancy and profitability. March calving heifers were supplemented from September to February at two locations across 2 yr. Supplementing to meet MP requirements improved pregnancy and profitability in three of four situations. ^ Grazing system affected fall diet nutrient content. Grazed forage intake of March-calving heifers declined over the winter, and supplementing heifers to meed MP requirements during gestation increased 2 -yr-old pregnancy. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an algorithm for decentralized (in-network) data mining {{of the movement}} pattern flock amongst mobile geosensor nodes. The algorithm DDIG (<b>Deferred</b> Decentralized Information <b>Grazing)</b> allows roaming sensor nodes to ‘graze’ over time more information than they could access through their spatially limited perception range alone. The algorithm requires an intrinsic temporal deferral for pattern mining, as sensor nodes must be enabled to collect, memorize, exchange, and integrate their own and their neighbors’ most current movement history before reasoning about patterns. A first set of experiments with trajectories of simulated agents showed that the algorithm accuracy increases with growing deferral. A second set of experiments with trajectories of actual tracked livestock reveals some of the shortcomings of the conceptual flocking model underlying DDIG {{in the context of}} a smart farming application. Finally, the experiments underline the general conclusion that decentralization in spatial computing can result in imperfect, yet useful knowledge...|$|R
40|$|Riparian {{ecosystems}} {{occupy a}} narrow belt of land along streams and around lakes and wetlands and {{are characterized by}} plant and animal communities that are dependent on close proximity to water. These ecotones function as buffer zones for materials moving from the uplands toward the surface water. They control stream morphology and ecology and also maintain landscape biodiversity by providing diverse habitats and corridors for animals and plants. Most of the riparian zones in the Midwestern agroecosystems and arid and semiarid western rangelands have been extensively impacted by agricultural cropping and grazing activities. These impacts have generally decreased water quality, impaired riparian and instream biodiversity, increased water quantity, and modified the timing of streamflow. Riparian zones are generally resilient because of their moist, moderate and fertile environments. With proper management, this resiliency can be sustained. Proper management should include construction or restoration of multi-species buffer strips and <b>deferred</b> or rotational <b>grazing</b> or exclusion of livestock. Several riparian zone restoration and management strategies are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the agronomic characteristics and nutritional value of Massai grass (Megathyrsus maximus ‘Massai’) pastures fertilized with different nitrogen levels and subjected to <b>deferred</b> <b>grazing.</b> A completely randomized experimental design (CRD) was adopted, with including five nitrogen levels (zero, 100, 200, 300, and 400 kg ha? 1), and five replications (plots). The degradability trial used a CRD including a 6 × 5 factorial arrangement, consisting of six rumen-incubation times (6, 24, 48, 60, 84, and 96 h) and five levels of nitrogen in different plots. One fistulated sheep, with a live weight of 60 kg, {{was used in the}} experiment. Total herbage biomass, dead herbage biomass, and height showed a quadratic response to nitrogen fertilization levels of 100 to 200 kg ha- 1 resulted in greater tillering. Protein and dry matter content increased linearly with nitrogen fertilization level, leading to increase in fibrous components. The increase in NDF and ADF contents might be a consequence of the reduction in NCE, and the high flowering rate of the grass, owing likely to the reduction in metabolism of the grass in an attempt to extend its lifetime. Nitrogen levels of 300 kg ha? 1 or higher affected the productive characteristics positively, whereas the chemical characteristics were negatively affected...|$|E
40|$|This {{experiment}} was performed aiming to evaluate tiller population density, forage mass and its morphological components on pastures of Brachiaria decumbens cv. Basilisk. during deferment. The treatments encompassed four <b>deferred</b> <b>grazing</b> periods (18, 46, 74 and 121 days). A randomized block design with two replications was used. The numbers of vegetative tillers (VT), reproductive tillers (RT) and dead tillers (DT) {{in the pasture}} were determined. The masses of green leaf blade (GLBM), dead stem (DSM) and dead forage (DFM) were also determined. There was {{a reduction in the}} number of VT (from 1, 491 to 944 tiller m- 2) during the deferment period. RT and DT numbers were not influenced by the deferment periods. Their averages were 211 and 456 tiller m- 2, respectively. Longer deferring periods resulted in an increase in GSM (from 2, 965 to 4, 877 kg ha- 1 of dry mass) and DFM (from 2, 324 to 4, 823 kg ha- 1 of dry mass), but it did not influence GLBM (average of 2, 047 kg ha- 1 of dry mass).

40|$|The {{impact of}} cattle {{trampling}} on grassland birds {{is all the}} more important since bird nest during months with highest grass growth. Therefore management prescriptions aim at limiting stocking rate during spring. However it is still unclear to what extent these thresholds on stocking rate reduce productive performance. Based on a model linking grazing strategies and dynamics of two bird species we developed a cost effectiveness approach to assess ecological and productive outcomes of environmental friendly policies for a large range of stocking rate constraints (SRC). The absence of SRC over 15 years led bird populations close to extinction for both species while ensured optimal productive performance. Moderate level of SRC limited productive performance by 15 % and avoided bird extinction with unequal outcomes for each species (respectively 37 % and 62 % of initial population size). Highest levels of SRC reduced productive performance by 25 % with minor decline of wader populations. These good performances on both economic and ecological viewpoints can be explained by <b>deferred</b> <b>grazing.</b> A maximal economic performance seems to be sorely compatible with ecological outcomes. These results could be used to design management compensations based on the level of constraints imposed on the livestock farming system...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT- This {{study was}} {{conducted}} with the objective of evaluating the effect of concentrate supplementation, formulated with different ingredients (Mesquite pod meal, sorghum meal or wheat meal and mineral supplementation) on performance, intake and digestibility of nutrients in Santa Inês lambs grazing on urochloa grass during the dry season. Twenty-four uncastrated weaned Santa Inês sheep, with average body weight (BW) 20 ± 2 kg with an average of 120 days of age were used in the assay. The experiment lasted 75 days. The animals <b>grazing</b> <b>deferred</b> Urochloa grass (Urochloa mosambicensis (Hack) Daudy) were distributed into four treatments consisting of mineral supplementation provided ad libitum and concentrated supplements containing mesquite pod meal, sorghum meal or wheat meal, supplied 10 g /kg BW on dry matter basis. The intakes of dry matter (DM) and crude protein (CP) were affected by the intake of concentrate supplement, regardless of the ingredients used in the supplements, compared with the mineral supplementation treatment, since the consumption of forage was reduced in 30 % with mesquite pod meal supplement, and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) intake was not affected in relation to treatments. The digestibility of DM and CP were higher for treatments with supplements, and NDF digestibility did not differ between treatments. A significant difference was observed in the values of average daily gain for the treatments with concentrate supplementation compared with the one of mineral supplementation. The supplementation with concentrate in grazing enables improvement of performance, intake and digestibility of nutrients regardless of the ingredient used i...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effects of 5 consecutive years of summer grazing date and fall stocking rate on vegetation and dietary crude protein content of cows grazing rangeland in the Nebraska Sandhills. Paddocks were grazed at a summer stocking rate of 0. 5 AUM ha- 1 in June or July, or <b>deferred</b> from summer <b>grazing.</b> The paddocks were then grazed in the fall at stocking rates of 0. 0 AUM ha- 1, 1. 0 AUM ha-l, 2. 0 AUM ha- 1, or 3 AUM ha-l. Summer grazing date does not appear to consistently affect herbage production, fall standing crop, herbage disappearance, or fall diet quality. Fall stocking rate reduced cool-season graminoid production although this effect appears to require 3 to 5 consecutive years of fall grazing. Disappearance increased with increasing fall stocking rate by year 5 of the experiment. Crude protein content of fall diets declines with increasing fall grazing pressure but does not appear to be dictated by summer grazing date. Animal intake of fall herbage appeared to be restricted to some degree by low quality forage. ^ In the second experiment, botanical composition, root mass-density, and carbon/nitrogen budgets were compared between cool-season and warm-season subirrigated meadows in the Sandhills. Vegetation yields and composition were sampled at each of 5 cool-season and 5 warm-season meadows. The A and C horizons of one-half of the soil cores (n= 150) extracted from each meadow were analyzed for total C and N content. Stable C isotope analysis was conducted on soil sub-samples from the A and C horizon to determine the origin of soil C. The remaining soil cores were segmented into 10 -cm increments. Root material was extracted from each 10 -cm increment to estimate root mass-density distribution. Cool-season meadows had 12...|$|R
