50|$|In the 1880s the reaper and <b>threshing</b> <b>machine</b> were {{combined}} into the combine harvester. These machines required large teams of horses or mules to pull. Steam power {{was applied to}} <b>threshing</b> <b>machines</b> in the late 19th century. There were steam engines that moved around on wheels under their own power for supplying temporary power to stationary <b>threshing</b> <b>machines.</b> These were called road engines, and Henry Ford seeing one as a boy was inspired to build an automobile.|$|R
50|$|The Swing Riots in the UK were {{partly a}} result of the <b>threshing</b> <b>machine.</b> Following years of war, high taxes and low wages, farm labourers finally revolted in 1830. These farm labourers had faced {{unemployment}} {{for a number of years}} due to the widespread introduction of the <b>threshing</b> <b>machine</b> and the policy of enclosing fields. No longer were thousands of men needed to tend the crops, a few would suffice. With fewer jobs, lower wages and no prospects of things improving for these workers the <b>threshing</b> <b>machine</b> was the final straw, the machine was to place them on the brink of starvation. The Swing Rioters smashed <b>threshing</b> <b>machines</b> and threatened farmers who had them.|$|R

50|$|The Swing Riots were a {{widespread}} uprising by agricultural workers; {{it began with}} the destruction of <b>threshing</b> <b>machines</b> in the Elham Valley area of East Kent {{in the summer of}} 1830, and by early December had spread throughout the whole of southern England and East Anglia.As well as the attacks on the popularly hated, labour-displacing <b>threshing</b> <b>machines,</b> the protesters reinforced their demands with wage and tithe riots and by the destruction of objects of perceived oppression, such as workhouses and tithe barns, and also with the more surreptitious rick-burning, and cattle-maiming. The first <b>threshing</b> <b>machine</b> was destroyed on Saturday night, 28 August 1830, and by the third week of October more than 100 <b>threshing</b> <b>machines</b> had been destroyed in East Kent.|$|R
