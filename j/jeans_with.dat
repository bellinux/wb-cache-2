500|$|The {{show was}} divided into five sections: Cyber-Punk, Geisha, Cowgirl, Spanish and Ghetto.

500|$|In the {{original}} Broadway production, {{the stage was}} completely open, with no curtain and the fly area and grid exposed to the audience. [...] The proscenium arch was outlined with climb-ready scaffolding. [...] Wagner's spare set was painted in shades of grey with street graffiti stenciled on the stage. [...] The stage was raked, and a tower of abstract scaffolding upstage at the rear merged a Native American totem pole and a modern sculpture of a crucifix-shaped tree. [...] This scaffolding was decorated with found objects that the cast had gathered {{from the streets of}} New York. [...] These included a life-size papier-mâché bus driver, the head of Jesus, and a neon marquee of the Waverly movie theater in Greenwich Village. [...] Potts' costumes were based on hippie street clothes, made more theatrical with enhanced color and texture. [...] Some of these included mixed parts of military uniforms, bell bottom <b>jeans</b> <b>with</b> Ukrainian embroidery, tie dyed T-shirts and a red white and blue fringed coat. [...] Early productions were primarily reproductions of this basic design.|$|E
500|$|On November 23, 1998, Madonna {{appeared}} on the Spanish RTVE show El Séptimo de Caballeria and performed [...] "Drowned World/Substitute for Love", along with her other song [...] "The Power of Good-Bye". Three years later, Madonna named her 2001 Drowned World Tour after the song, and performed it as the opening number. She entered the stage amidst billows of dry ice, dressed in a sleeveless black top, crossover top with one net sleeve, <b>jeans</b> <b>with</b> zips and bondage straps, a studded dog collar and a tartan kilt and performed the song standing on a [...] rising platform on {{the middle of the}} stage. Also during this same tour, the last lyrics from the song ("Now, I find I changed my mind/This is my religion") were used {{at the end of the}} performance of [...] "Ray of Light". The performance at The Palace of Auburn Hills in Auburn Hills, Michigan on August 26, 2001 was released in the live video release, Drowned World Tour 2001. Michael Hubbard from MusicOMH gave the performance a positive review, saying it was sung beautifully.

She was joined by backup singers Niki Haris and Donna DeLory, who also contributed with background vocals on the track. Costumes for the performance included spiked dog collars, Swarovski crystal-encrusted bracelets and tattered tops; Madonna herself wore a sleeveless black top, crossover top with one net sleeve, <b>jeans</b> <b>with</b> zips and bondage straps and a tartan kilt. The backdrop during the performance displayed scenes from the movie and psychedelic fluorescent whirls. It also featured a lost technician at the end and elements of [...] "Soul Bossa Nova (Dim's Space-A-Nova)", another song from the film's soundtrack. On September 15, 2001, the tour's final date, Madonna's then husband Guy Ritchie joined her onstage as the lost technician.

500|$|For Kilgrave, Maslansky used many suits {{created by}} {{designer}} Paul Smith, rather than custom-making {{them as she}} originally planned, as Smith [...] "was [...] about purple" [...] in the previous fashion season. On the suits, Maslansky added that the designers [...] "wanted {{to find a place}} where we could utilize clothing in shades of purple, but not go so over the top that it would look silly and that he would stop feeling ominous or menacing." [...] Expanding on this, Maslansky called purple a traditionally [...] "fairly friendly color, and he’s anything but friendly. So I had to find ways to make him be ominous and frightening and terrifying. I found that I needed the right proportion of shades of purple to other shades that were similar: navy, black, maroon." [...] Maslansky felt Luke Cage was also someone [...] "who wears his clothing like an armor," [...] with his wardrobe consisting of T-shirts, jeans, leather jackets or an army jacket. For a character like Trish Walker, who does not {{have the same kind of}} [...] "statement costume" [...] as Jones, Maslansky tried to create a certain character style. Maslansky said that Walker's uniform is fashion, so [...] "even when she was hanging around the house, she was wearing a pair of rag & bone <b>jeans</b> <b>with</b> a Chloé top, and this was her version of a T-shirt and jeans." [...] Maslansky added that Robin was [...] "a blast to dress" [...] because of her [...] "quirky" [...] personality, yet she was still able to [...] "put herself together aesthetically." [...] For Malcolm, as his story progressively became brighter throughout the season, so did his wardrobe, becoming [...] "a little brighter and a little more hopeful." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{removing}} the wig, Cyrus then reappeared to perform eight more songs as herself. She {{emerged from the}} bottom of the runaway to perform [...] "Start All Over". She was costumed by studded black <b>jeans</b> <b>with</b> chains attached to the waist, a white tank top, a black leather vest and a matching glove. She roamed throughout the stage, kicking over the microphone stand and banging her head. [...] "Good and Broken" [...] and [...] "See You Again", where Cyrus removed the vest and was joined by multiple backup dancers, rounded off the show's fourth segment. She returned to the stage in a fuchsia bustier and short, black ruffled skirt to perform [...] "Let's Dance", where she performed Latin-influenced choreography with backup dancers, and [...] "Right Here". Prior to Cyrus re-entering the stage for the sixth segment, backup singers sang a reworked version of Toni Basil's [...] "Mickey" [...] (1982) that replaced the word [...] "Mickey" [...] with [...] "Miley". Cyrus, costumed in a pink tank top, a plaid miniskirt and sneakers with high-knee socks, performed [...] "East Northumberland High", amid backup dancers dressed as skateboarders and football players. Adding a black jacket, she concluded the main concert with [...] "G.N.O. (Girl's Night Out)" [...] and the theme to Hannah Montana, [...] "The Best of Both Worlds", a song credited to her alter ego. The latter had Cyrus interacting with video that depicted Hannah Montana and ended with the firing of confetti and fireworks. Sporadically throughout the Best Both Worlds Tour, Cyrus returned on stage for the performance of a one-song encore, which was either [...] "I Miss You" [...] or [...] "Ready, Set, Don't Go", a duet with her father Billy Ray Cyrus. Both songs were performed in an acoustic setting, without dancers or special effects. The prior had Cyrus performing acoustic guitar herself, while the latter had her father doing so.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Red Blooded Woman" [...] was {{directed}} by Jake Nava, an English film director who had previously worked with artists like Beyoncé and Kelis. It was filmed in Los Angeles, California, in December 2003. It begins with a scene of a congested traffic jam in which Minogue is caught. She is shown seated in her car singing to the song in a sensual manner, with the camera repeatedly focusing on her eyes and lips. Her outfit is composed of {{a black and white}} singlet, a satin waist cincher, <b>jeans</b> <b>with</b> chain fringes, and a black sheepskin shrug (this outfit was donated by Minogue to the Arts Centre Melbourne and is displayed in the Kylie Minogue Collection). A few seconds later, she gets down from her vehicle and playfully makes her way to a tank. Climbing up on its ladder, Minogue dances seductively to the chorus of the song. She then resumes walking on the street and is accompanied by two doberman puppies who escape from a nearby car. After entering into the backseat of another car, Minogue begins unwrapping a red dress and proceeds to change into it as she is watched by various onlookers. As the second chorus starts, Minogue is seen dancing with a group of backup dancers at a different location. Her attire consists of a fluorine yellow bustier worn underneath a pastel pink dress designed by French fashion house Balenciaga. The scene changes back to the street, where Minogue is shown entering a truck. She dims the lights and then dances in a different outfit, consisting of a black bikini, red leggings, and laced gloves. However, she exits the truck in the same red outfit she donned earlier. The rest of the video rapidly intersperses scenes of Minogue dancing inside and in front of the truck, on a car, with the backup dancers, and near a gang of motorcyclists.|$|E
