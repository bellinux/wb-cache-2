5|$|File {{artifacts}} and meta-data {{can be used}} to identify the origin of a particular piece of data; for example, older versions of Microsoft Word embedded a Global Unique Identifer into files which identified the computer it had been created on. Proving whether a file was produced on the digital device being examined or obtained <b>from</b> <b>elsewhere</b> (e.g., the Internet) can be very important.|$|E
5|$|Migratory {{patterns}} of these subspecies {{are not well}} known. For example, pygmy blue whales have been recorded in the northern Indian Ocean (Oman, Maldives and Sri Lanka), where they may form a distinct resident population. Furthermore, sightings have been recorded <b>from</b> <b>elsewhere</b> in and adjacent to Arabian Sea, including from Gulf of Aden, Persian Gulf, coasts of Bay of Bengal including Bangladesh to Myanmar, and within the Strait of Malacca. The first official confirmation within Thailand's EEZ occurred at Trang in 2013.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers {{complained of}} the game's high price, which was {{nearly double the}} average. Crash {{wondered}} if the cost might lead to more piracy. Critics also noted a bug in two-player mode, repeat screens <b>from</b> <b>elsewhere</b> in the maze, and the frustratingly narrow window in which sabre swings register as enemy hits. CVG recommended drawing {{a map of the}} maze, without which it was easy to get lost. While Sabre Wulf had some flicker issues, said Sinclair User, the game altogether met Ultimate's high quality benchmarks.|$|E
5|$|The Western Australian gold rushes of the 1890s {{resulted}} in strong economic growth, {{and a massive}} increase in population: doubling from almost 50,000 in 1891 to more than 100,000 by 1895, and expanding to 184,000 by 1901. The influx included desperate, dishonest people, <b>from</b> <b>elsewhere</b> in Australia and overseas, and Fremantle Prison was soon overcrowded.|$|E
5|$|The act was {{a result}} of the stormy {{relationship}} between Aberhart and the press, which dated to before the 1935 election, in which the Social Credit League was elected to government. Virtually all of Alberta's newspapers—especially the Calgary Herald—were critical of Social Credit, as were a number of publications <b>from</b> <b>elsewhere</b> in Canada. Even the American media had greeted Aberhart's election with derision.|$|E

5|$|The {{greatest}} threat to manta rays is overfishing. M. birostris is not evenly distributed over the oceans, but is concentrated in areas that provide the food resources it requires, while M. alfredi is even more localized. Their distributions are thus fragmented, with little evidence of intermingling of subpopulations. Because of their long lifespans and low reproductive rate, overfishing can severely reduce local populations with little likelihood that individuals <b>from</b> <b>elsewhere</b> will replace them.|$|E
5|$|The {{place of}} birth of the town's {{residents}} was 96.8% United Kingdom (including 95.13% from England), 0.6% Republic of Ireland, 0.5% from other European Union countries, and 2.1% <b>from</b> <b>elsewhere</b> in the world. Religion was recorded as 84% Christian, 1.7% Muslim, 0.2% Hindu, 0.2% Buddhist, 0.1% Jewish and <0.1% Sikh. Some 6.8% were recorded as having no religion, 0.1% had an alternative religion, and 5.6% did not state their religion.|$|E

In the last Yugoslav census in 1991, the Vukovar municipality, which included the town and surrounding villages, was recorded as having 84,189 inhabitants, of whom 43.8 percent were Croats, 37.5 percent were Serbs and the remainder were members of other ethnic groups. The town's population was 47 percent Croat and 32.3 percent Serb.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of the players who have played a hundred times or more for QPR are from England, with 35 players either coming from or played internationally for other countries. Seventeen of those foreign players come from one of the other Home Nations of the UK, seven players come <b>from</b> <b>elsewhere</b> in Europe, two from South America, two from Africa, five from the Caribbean islands, and two from North America. There are no players in the list from either Asia or Australasia.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the vast}} {{majority}} of life on Earth lives in mesophyllic (moderate) environments, a few organisms, most of them microbes, have managed to colonise extreme environments that are unsuitable for most higher life forms. There are bacteria, for example, living in Lake Whillans, half a mile below the ice of Antarctica; in the absence of sunlight, they must rely on organic material <b>from</b> <b>elsewhere,</b> perhaps decaying matter from glacier melt water or minerals from the underlying rock. Other bacteria can be found in abundance in the Mariana Trench, the deepest place in the ocean and on Earth; marine snow drifts down from the surface layers of the sea and accumulates in this undersea valley, providing nourishment for an extensive community of bacteria.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal went on {{to finish}} second in 1925–26, five points behind Chapman's old side Huddersfield Town, as they became the first club in England to win three titles in succession. It {{proved to be an}} early dawn for Arsenal, who spent {{most of the rest of}} the 1920s in mid-table, as Chapman took his time finding the right players to fit his new system, {{outlining}} a five-year plan for success. He retained relatively few players of his predecessor Knighton's era – Bob John, Alf Baker and Jimmy Brain being the exceptions – and instead looked to bring in talent <b>from</b> <b>elsewhere.</b>|$|E
5|$|As of 2012 {{the ground}} and top floors of the main house, {{together}} with the adjacent wings, are used as accommodation for the elderly. The reception rooms of the first floor {{are open to the}} public at advertised times, and are entered by the original stairway on the south front; they contain paintings and furniture collected by the Leicester family. Some items in the collection had formerly been displayed on this floor, whilst others were moved <b>from</b> <b>elsewhere</b> in the house. The first floor may also be hired for weddings, meetings, and conferences. It is managed by a trust, which is supported by a group of Friends and by volunteers.|$|E
5|$|By 1853 {{a service}} range {{had been added}} to the south wing of the house. In 1868 the {{external}} flight of stairs was removed from the west front and a new porch entrance was added to its ground floor. The entrance featured a Norman doorway that had been moved <b>from</b> <b>elsewhere</b> in the monastery; Greene believes that it probably formed the entrance from the west cloister walk into the nave of the church. An exact replica of this doorway was built and placed {{to the north of the}} Norman doorway, making a double entrance. The whole of the undercroft was radically restored, giving it a Gothic theme, adding stained glass windows and a medieval-style fireplace. The ground to the south of the house was levelled and formal gardens were established.|$|E
