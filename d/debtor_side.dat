So he goes back to him the next day, and settles accounts with him, pays him the balance in good bills which he brought up with him for that purpose, takes a receipt in full of all accounts and demands to such a day of the month, and the next day comes and looks out another parcel of goods, and so begins an account for the next year, like a current chapman, and has the credit of an extraordinary customer that pays well, and clears his accounts every year; which he had not done had he not seen the advantage, and so strained himself to pay, that he might get a receipt in full of all accounts.|$|E

40|$|The project {{represents}} the twofold condition {{present in the}} system of finance, the creditor and the debtor. The creditor and the <b>debtor</b> are two <b>sides</b> to the same medal; one cannot exist without the other. The different manifestations {{of the system of}} finance are a reflection of the different relations between the creditor and the debtor. The creditor-debtor relation is now an impersonal one, reduced to a business transaction; the creditor is institutionalized and is protected. The aspects of the impersonal, institutionalized, creditor are amassed in the Central Bank. Aspects of the creditor, with the Dutch Central Bank as it physical representation, are summarized, collapsed into a building, a building that {{represents the}}ir ongoing power, protecting the creditor from any possible doubt. The aim of the project is not to change the nature of the Dutch Central Bank and the banking system, by now almost purely representational, but to make it explicit. The condition of indebtedness is widespread; we are all debtors. The Dutch population holds one of the highest private debts in the Eurozone and its total private debt surpasses corporate debt. The debtor must inspire trust in his solvency, his ability to fulfill future payments, his accountability and responsibility. As debt has come to involve everyone it refers to no one in particular. An absence of representation represents this condition. Aspects of the debtor are reflected in a public square, a public space, where one, by appearing in public is available for the scrutiny of others, in a sense the essence of the indebted condition. To attempt to collapse the characteristics of the indebted into a building or a certain program would be to deny this condition, to deny its widespread existence, it would deny the fact that debt has indiscriminately involved everyone. The uncertain, undetermined space of the public square reflects the boundless condition of the indebted an antithesis to the enclosed space opposing it. The lobby is the place of intersection between creditor and debtor, a place of representation for the creditor, a place of accountability for the debtor. It is the place where both conditions come together and dissolve into one, the lobby as the central space of the Central Bank allows the debtor to penetrate into the territory of the creditor.

40|$|In the Middle Ages, traders from sorne {{settlements}} of Dubrovnik {{were suffering}} {{the consequences of}} bankruptcy and sequester of there own property. For the purpose of direct presentation,t here were used analyzed examples from the territory of Bosnia and Serbia. In that, there was noticed that there was actually {{no difference between the}} period of 15 th and 16 th century. Operational difficulties of independent traders and their associations used to occur on occasions when they were not able to comply with their liabilities towards the lenders, mostly creditors and when they became over indebted. For such situation, the presumption of guilt was on the borrower, and only sporadically it was determined that the state of bankruptcy appeared because of late delivery of goods from the supplier. Although the relationship towards the debtors in bankmptcy and sequester was strict and judgmental, there were acts and measures which brought to milder utilization of bankruptcy and failure of the traders. On many occasions, before the bankruptcy there was often used remedy in a way of writing off the debt or lowering the indebted amount. Since the crediting of traders was performed with the guarantee of their assets, for the purpose of repaying the debt, both movable and fixed assets were taken from the debtor. Since the debtors were not able to pay their liabilities on many occasions, their assets were sold for the purpose of settling the lenders. That was the situation for Bosnian traders as well (Drijevo, Sarajevo, Foča) and also in Serbia (Smederevo, Belgrade). As the instrument of guarantee for the lenders, there were used oath, guarantee (message) from the main and <b>side</b> <b>debtors,</b> holding the assets of the debtor, promissory note, bill of exchange and contractual punishment. But the ultimate aim of bankruptcy and sequester over the assets of traders was not just settling the lenders, but also expected exit from the hard situation in which the debtor was. It was rightfully considered that helping the debtor to overcome the state of inability of paying their debts, creates positive atmosphere for further cooperation and doing business together. Therefore, traders of Dubrovnik, as well as lenders showed high level of skill of reaching optimal possibilities for better economical and market operation, by avoiding negative influence of occasional crisis and problems of market competition. Regarding the stated opinion, they can be used as bright example of protection of trading practice and accomplishing positive social contacts and dark numbers of bankruptcy period of commercial association...|$|R

This is a step backward," [...] said a Hong Kong-based credit analyst at a European bank. The analyst, like his many of colleagues in the industry based outside Bangkok, see the resolution of the TPI case as a litmus test for the restructuring of billions of dollars worth of Thai corporate debt and crucial to Thailand's ability to attract and retain foreign investment. Observers, based in the Thai capital, however, are more tempered. [...] "The TPI case is very unique," [...] Kowit explains. [...] "First the amount involved, US$3.8 billion, is huge. Second, the company's labour union have mostly supported Prachai is very strong. And lastly, the creditor side involves some of the largest domestic and foreign institutions." [...] Kowit also says many in Thailand were surprised that the rehabilitation plan did not permit any haircuts and that the creditors could take 75 percent equity in the company through conversion of accrued interest of US$756 million in only three years. Prachai has repeatedly accused the lenders of not paying enough attention to the long-term viability of the company and focusing primarily on maximizing short-term returns. Speaking after the 13 June judgment, Kitti Limsakul, the advisor to Thailand's finance minister, told Dow Jones Newswires that an earlier proposal to set up a 15-member tripartite debt administration team consisting of seven members each from the creditor and <b>debtor</b> <b>side,</b> headed by a mediator from the government had been modified. Now, the finance ministry is willing to permit unequal representation of the two sides, depending on who is suitable. With the 2005 ruling, Prachai was forced to sell his and his family's stock at 70 percent below the market price at 3.30 baht per share to the recently privatized petroleum corporation PTT Public Company Limited (PTT). Subsequently Prachai and his siblings were ejected from the board, and were replaced by PTT nominees.|$|E

Extending Morris and Shin (2006), we consider that the IMF’s intervention policy usually exerts a signaling effect on private creditors and that several interventions in sequence may be necessary to avert an impending crisis. Absent of the IMF’s signaling ability, our results state that repeated intervention is required to bail out a country, whereby additional assistance may induce moral hazard on the <b>debtor</b> <b>side.</b> Contrarily, if the IMF exerts a strong signaling effect, one single intervention suffices to avoid liquidity crises...|$|E

Specifically, we find i) international net private capital flows (inflows minus outflows of private capital) are positively correlated with countries’ productivity growth, ii) net sovereign debt flows (government borrowing minus reserves) are negatively correlated with growth only if net public debt is financed by another sovereign, iii) net public debt financed by private creditors is positively correlated with growth, iv) public savings are strongly positively correlated with growth, whereas correlation between private savings and growth is flat and statistically insignificant. These empirical facts contradict the conventional wisdom and constitute a challenge for the existing theories on upstream capital flows and global imbalances. ...|$|E
