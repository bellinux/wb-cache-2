2500|$|Two players {{alternate}} {{naming the}} {{stations of the}} London Underground. The first to say [...] "Finchley Central" [...] wins. It {{is clear that the}} [...] "best" [...] time to say [...] "Finchley Central" [...] is exactly before your opponent does. Failing that, it is good that he should be considering it. You could, of course, say [...] "Finchley Central" [...] on your second turn. In that case, your opponent puffs on <b>his</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>and</b> says, [...] "Well, shame on you".|$|E
2500|$|To {{prepare for}} the role, De Niro {{consulted}} with Pileggi, who had research material that had been discarded while writing the book. De Niro often called Hill {{several times a day}} to ask how Burke walked, held <b>his</b> <b>cigarette,</b> <b>and</b> so on. Driving to and from the set, Liotta listened to FBI audio cassette tapes of Hill, so he could practice speaking like his real-life counterpart. To research her role, Lorraine Bracco tried to get close to a mob wife but was unable to, because they exist in a very tight-knit community. She decided not to meet the real Karen, saying she [...] "thought {{it would be better if}} the creation came from me. I used her life with her parents as an emotional guideline for the role". Paul Sorvino had no problem finding the voice and walk of his character, but found it challenging finding what he called [...] "that kernel of coldness and absolute hardness that is antithetical to my nature except when my family is threatened".|$|E

He decides to confront the young man, <b>and</b> smokes <b>his</b> <b>cigarettes</b> one after the other. The young man does the same {{and it becomes a}} contest. Finally Septimus, feeling that he has taught the young man a lesson, opens his briefcase to find <b>his</b> <b>cigarettes</b> <b>and</b> paper intact, implying that he has actually been smoking the young man's <b>cigarettes</b> <b>and</b> been abusing the young man's paper.|$|R

60|$|Francis {{knocked the}} ash off <b>his</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>and</b> rose slowly to his feet.|$|E
60|$|She {{came over}} to him and hung upon his arm. He threw <b>his</b> <b>cigarette</b> away <b>and</b> kissed her upon the lips.|$|R
6000|$|He had {{meanwhile}} {{taken out}} <b>his</b> <b>cigarette</b> case <b>and</b> was looking {{about for a}} match. But something else occurred to him. [...] "You must come to Victoria." ...|$|R
5000|$|Toby's stay as a convalescent, {{surrounded}} by shell-shocked military veterans, {{leads him to}} new terrors, especially after other patients suddenly die. Dr. Burns implores him to confront his demons, but during the night, Toby starts suffering from horrific nightmares, reliving the terrible carnage he had created. Reoccurring hallucinations and visions begin to cloud his mind. His only outlet is <b>his</b> <b>cigarettes</b> <b>and</b> the doting attention of Sister Sally Grant (Melissa Lloyd), a nursing sister.|$|R

60|$|For a {{few moments}} they stood motionless. Affery {{was the first to}} move, and she, {{wringing}} her hands, pursued her mistress. Next, Jeremiah Flintwinch, slowly backing to the door, with one hand in a pocket, and the other rubbing his chin, twisted himself out in his reticent way, speechlessly. Rigaud, left alone, composed himself upon the window-seat of the open window, in the old Marseilles-jail attitude. He laid <b>his</b> <b>cigarettes</b> <b>and</b> fire-box ready to his hand, and fell to smoking.|$|R
60|$|Pedro again looked musingly at <b>his</b> <b>cigarette,</b> <b>and</b> flipped off the ash {{with his}} little finger.|$|E

60|$|Elizabeth {{glanced at}} the little clock upon her table, and Philip threw away <b>his</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>and</b> came forward.|$|E
60|$|Lewisham fumbled in {{his pocket}} for <b>his</b> Algerian <b>cigarettes,</b> <b>and</b> Chaffery having {{regarded}} them unfavourably through his glasses, took up the thread of his promised apologia. The ladies retired to wash up the supper things.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Blow!" [...] he said, at last, and then, viciously, [...] "Blow!" [...] and so rose <b>and</b> flung away <b>his</b> <b>cigarette</b> end, <b>and</b> pursued <b>his</b> reluctant, dubiating {{way towards}} the really quite uncongenial splendours of the Royal Grand....|$|R
500|$|Westcott's February 1946 photo {{portrait}} of Oppenheimer is highly regarded for depicting the Manhattan Project scientific director {{as a man}} weary from the tremendous weight of his experience. When he met with Oppenheimer, Westcott learned that the physicist wanted a cigarette but lacked the change to buy some. [...] After Westcott gave him the money he needed, Oppenheimer bought <b>his</b> <b>cigarettes</b> <b>and</b> lit one. Westcott then captured {{the image of the}} physicist sitting next to a fireplace mantel in the Oak Ridge Guest House holding the freshly lighted <b>cigarette</b> in <b>his</b> hand.|$|R
60|$|He smiled, {{and looked}} at me over <b>his</b> <b>cigarette,</b> <b>and</b> I laughed at his quiet {{exposure}} of my modest pretence.|$|E

6000|$|... "I must," [...] said Kipps, nodding {{his head}} slowly with raised eyebrows. He looked at <b>his</b> <b>cigarette</b> end <b>and</b> threw it into the fender. He was {{beginning}} to think he was holding his own in this conversation rather well, after all.|$|R

6000|$|Presently Fogerty strolled over, smoking <b>his</b> eternal <b>cigarette,</b> <b>and</b> stood {{watching}} the pressman, as if {{interested in the}} oiling of the complicated machine.

5000|$|Returning to Oregon, {{he came up}} {{with the}} idea of [...] "Death Cigarettes" [...] in 1991. Deciding to be honest about the effect of cigarettes, Southwood, a smoker from age 13 to 40, decided to be brutally honest about <b>his</b> <b>cigarettes.</b> In {{addition}} to the standard warnings, Death Cigarettes were packed in their own coffin: a stark little black package bearing a skull and crossbones. Southwood traveled to the Southern United States, where the major U.S. tobacco companies found his idea [...] "antithetical to their interests." [...] He found a small tobacco company in Holland that was willing to manufacture <b>his</b> <b>cigarettes,</b> <b>and</b> he briefly took up smoking again to get the blend of tobaccos just right, however he couldn't find a cigarette distributor willing to move his product into stores. [...] "I think they're afraid of pressure from the major cigarette manufacturers".|$|R
