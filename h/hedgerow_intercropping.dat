40|$|Land {{degradation}} in the Philippine uplands is {{severe and}} widespread. Most upland areas are steep, and intense rainfall on soils disturbed by intensive agriculture can produce {{high rates of}} soil loss. This has serious implications for the economic welfare of a growing upland population with few feasible livelihood alternatives. <b>Hedgerow</b> <b>intercropping</b> can greatly reduce soil loss from annual cropping systems and has been considered an appropriate technology for soil conservation research and extension in the Philippine uplands. However; adoption of <b>hedgerow</b> <b>intercropping</b> has been sporadic and transient, rarely continuing once external support has been withdrawn. The objective {{of this paper is}} to investigate the economic incentives for farmers in the Philippine uplands to adopt <b>hedgerow</b> <b>intercropping</b> relative to traditional open-field maize farming. Cost-benefit analysis is used to compare the economic viability of <b>hedgerow</b> <b>intercropping,</b> as it has been promoted to upland farmers, with the viability of traditional methods of open-field farming. The APSIM and SCUAF models were used to predict the effect of soil erosion on maize yields from open-field farming and <b>hedgerow</b> <b>intercropping.</b> The results indicate that there have been strong economic incentives for farmers with limited planning horizons to reject <b>hedgerow</b> <b>intercropping</b> because the benefits of sustained yields are not realized rapidly enough to compensate for high establishment costs. Alternative forms of <b>hedgerow</b> <b>intercropping</b> such as natural vegetation and grass strips reduce establishment and maintenance costs and are therefore more economically attractive to farmers than <b>hedgerow</b> <b>intercropping</b> with shrub legumes.

40|$|Soil erosion in the Philippine uplands is severe. <b>Hedgerow</b> <b>intercropping</b> {{is widely}} {{advocated}} {{as an effective}} means of controlling soil erosion from annual cropping systems in the uplands. However, few farmers adopt <b>hedgerow</b> <b>intercropping</b> even in areas where it has been vigorously promoted. This may be because farmers find <b>hedgerow</b> <b>intercropping</b> to be uneconomic compared to traditional methods of farming. This paper reports a cost-benefit analysis comparing the economic returns from traditional maize farming with those from <b>hedgerow</b> <b>intercropping</b> in an upland community with no past adoption of hedgerows. A simple erosion/productivity model, Soil Changes Under Agroforestry (SCUAF), is used to predict maize yields over 25 years. Economic data were collected through key informant surveys with experienced maize farmers in an upland community. Traditional methods of open-field farming of maize are economically attractive to farmers in the Philippine uplands. In the short term, establishment costs are a major disincentive to the adoption of <b>hedgerow</b> <b>intercropping.</b> In the long term, higher economic returns from <b>hedgerow</b> <b>intercropping</b> compared to open-field farming are realised, but these lie beyond farmers 2 ̆ 7 limited planning horizons...|$|E

40|$|A major {{challenge}} for agroecology {{is to identify}} alternative cropping systems that can both ensure sufficient levels of food production and reduction in pesticide inputs while maintaining ecosystem integrity and simultaneously delivering multiple ecosystem services. Among ecological services, biocontrol of pests by natural enemies could be improved by effective management of semi-natural elements in landscape such as hedgerows (Landis et al., 2000). Another way to reduce pest populations in fields consists in increasing diversity of crop species both in time and space. A practice such as intercropping that creates structures of mixed plant populations with "barrier" or "dilution of resources" effects (Médiène et al., 2011) can reduce the pressure of pathogens, weeds and pests compared with that exerted on sole crops (Letourneau et al., 2011). While {{the combination of these}} two kinds of practices designed to strengthen auxiliary communities often appears efficient and could result in a synergy, many cases of study show opposite results (e. g. Straub and Snyder, 2006). Our study aimed at quantifying and comparing the efficiency of both <b>hedgerow</b> and <b>intercropped</b> pea and wheat on pest biocontrol in a field. We examined i) the potential role of different types of field edges (with and without an hedgerow) on biological control of weed seeds, aphids, pea weavils and eggs of Sitona lineatus, ii) the effect of intercropping on the biological control of these pests compared with sole crops and iii) the interaction between the two factors. We conducted both field surveys of pest abundance and pest biocontrol effectiveness by estimating predation rates by using seeds and prey sticked on cards. We found that aphid density was slightly lower in pea-wheat intercrops than in sole crops, and was influenced by the distance from the field edge (whatever the kind of edges). However, neither the <b>hedgerow</b> nor the <b>intercrop</b> situation favored aphid predation. The density of weeds did not vary according to the cropping system and distance from the field edge. We showed that the predation rate of weed seeds or of Sitona lineatus eggs and the parasitism of Bruchus pisorum decreased according to the distance to the hedge in sole crops but increased in the intercrop. This study points out the absence of a global synergy between intercrops and hedges in supporting pest and weed regulation: the regulation efficiency varied according to pest species. This study calls for a deepened multi-species approach in order to find trade-offs between agricultural practices and field edge management to optimize regulating ecosystem services such as pest biocontrol...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{discussion}} had reemerged {{over the}} value of integrated pest and crop management training, through intensive approaches such as farmer field schools or participatory training, as a development approach (Feder et al, 2004). This paper develops a model of human capital accumulation through participatory research and tests several hypotheses {{on the effectiveness of}} this approach to increase the adoption of soil conservation and fertility management innovations and improve farm productivity in southeast Asia. Bivariate Probit models with treatment effects are estimated using full information maximum likelihood (Evans and Schwab, 1995 : Trost and Lee, 1984) and covariates related to changes in land allocation and productivity, measured before project and after project intervention, are investigates. We follow Greene (1998) to control for simultaneity between adoption and impact by using the predicted adoption decision from the second set of regressions to calculate productivity differentials. Overall, we find that treatment affects associated with the participatory research activities are significant and positive in explaining the differential adoption rates of <b>intercropping,</b> <b>hedgerows,</b> contour ridging, the usage of farm yard manure and chemical fertilizer. The positive relationship between the adoption of soil conservation and fertility management techniques and participation, given very limited productivity impact, may indicated the "value" of the participatory approach to illustrate the social costs of land degradation, sensitize participants towards internalizing these costs, and demonstrate the importance of long-run strategies to preserve land productivity, or both. Secondly, we find that there are additional benefits to participatory research activities that are not embodied in the adoption of soil conservation or fertility management techniques.

40|$|A {{computer}} model, called BEAM (Big-Economic Agroforestry Modelling), {{has been}} developed to help people and organizations decide where and how to practice agroforestry. Technical and economic information on agroforestry world-wide can also be provided and exchanged. BEAM was designed at the University of Wales with funding from the European Union and the UK's Overseas Development Administration. BEAM will enable users to input all the information they have on how a particular project will be managed. Criteria include how the site is to be set up, the species and spacing of the trees, and the climatic and soil factors of the site. Different options 011 the wa in which the site could be planted can also be fed in. Once all the data are entered, information can be extracted from the model. For instance, projections can be obtained for an annual basis over a rotation of 20 or 30 years. Yields and returns of the crops and forestry species can be shown separately or as a whole for the agroforestry system, {{as opposed to the}} forestry system or the agriculture system. The model currently works for rubber, poplar, Pinus patula. and <b>hedgerow</b> plants <b>intercropped</b> with species like leucaena. gliricidia and maize. However, if the appropriate information is available in the required format then BEAM can be adapted for other tree species. BEAM has already been used in Tanzania to see how P patla trees can be grown with a mixture of crops underneath them at a small farm level, at village level or at regional level. A joint project with the Centre de cooperation international en recherche agronomique pour le developpement (CIRAD), funded by the European Union, will be using BEAM to assess the effect of cropping maize, cassava, groundnuts or cocoa under coconut palms. It will also look at a model for grazing livestock under palms. In the Embu district of Kenva a new initiative between the Kenya Forestry Research Institute (KEFRI), the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock, the International Centre for Research in Agroforestry (ICRAF) and the UK's Overseas Development Administration (ODA), is developing a BEAM model to determine the best strategies for feeding dairy cows, based 011 fodder cut from planted hedgerows. In south-east Asia the Australian National University have used a BEAM model to assist in the design of smallholder farming systems in Indonesia and the Philippines. It is also being used to simulate different spacings of rubber trees to create the right amount of shade to suppress imperata grass, which is a major problem for farmers in the region, and to asses the effect this would have on farm incomes. In India BEAM is being used to assess the effect of using eucalyptus trees in arid areas and in Europe to look for the best site and management system for fast growing poplars.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} in the Nakuru District of the Kenyan Highlands, the major milk sources for the Nairobi milk market, were to evaluate current dairy cattle rearing and feeding practices, and suggest efficient feeding management strategies on large and small-scale commercial dairy farms. 139 small-scale farms with 738 dairy cows were surveyed and 6 large-scale dairy farms with 4379 dairy cattle. On the small farms, high mortality rates, cost of AI, and disease were the major causes of poor reproduction leading {{to a lack of}} replacement stock. Feeding systems used were: 24 % free grazing system, 33 % semi-zero grazing, 40 % zero grazing, and 3 % rotational grazing, but limited feeds were available – crops and feed crop residues, cut grass on the roadside, neighbouring farms with some purchased hay and straws in the dry season. After weaning, feed supplements were rarely given to calves, priority being given to milking cows, explaining the few replacement stock kept and their high mortality. The six large scale farms were from 200 to 3500 acres with milk production, cereal crops, fodder crops, the scale of replacement dairy stock and hay to other dairy farms the main activities with land allocated 65 % to livestock, 20 % to cash crops (Barley and Wheat), 10 % to fodder crops and 5 % to other land-uses. Replacement heifers for sale were insufficient to meet demands from small-scale farms. Grazing systems were mainly extensive with supplements fed at milking.   All the farms depended on planted forage grasses, mainly: Rhodes grass, Star grass, Sudan grass and Kikuyu grass. Calf mortality rate (10 - 18 %) was high caused mostly by respiratory diseases and East Coast Fever. Extended age at first calving (> 31. 8 ± 4. 5 months), long calving intervals (> 406 days) and low average milk yields (6. 81 /day ± 3. 9) for all breeds, occurred. Production and reproductive performances needs to be addressed by proper nutrition. Suitable pasture grasses, legumes and fodder crops not currently being used have been identified as potential options to complement the existing pasture. Among these are: Guinea grass (panicum maximum), Cynodon dactylon, Buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris), Naivasha star grass (Cynodon plectostachyus) and Rhodesian star grass (Setaria sphacelata). Other studies examining supplementation of animals on low quality pastures with the above feeds resulted in increased body weights and milk yields. The greatest potential seems to be supplementing with home-grown proteinaceous feedstuffs such as Leucaena leucocephala, Calliandra, Sesbania or food crop residues like groundnut, cassava, sweet potato vines or pigeon-pea leaves and stems.

40|$|Thailands western uplands {{are facing}} severe soil loss and runoff {{problems}} due to intensive cultivation of cash crops for high food, feed, fiber, and fuel demand by an increasing population. Thus the Land Development Department and the International Board for Soil Research and Management in Thailand are promoting {{the use of}} soil conservation measures such as contour hedgerows, grass barriers and agroforestry systems based on fruit trees and annual crops. Although such measures {{have been shown to}} be effective in controlling soil erosion, farmers often are reluctant to adopt such practices as inclusion of trees reduces the cropped area and yields competition for available resources with crops. Hence, a better understanding of the underlying processes at the crop-soil-hedge interface is needed to design soil conservation systems that are more attractive for farmers. It was hypothesized that soil conservation systems with <b>hedgerows</b> and <b>intercropping</b> will induce spatial patterns of resource use which can be linked to competition while planting patterns affect canopy characteristics and light distributions. This study focused on the following objectives; (i) to improve understanding of competition at the crop soil hedge interface by combining stable isotope discrimination, electrical resistivity tomography and time domain reflectometry, (ii) to identify the effects of <b>intercropping</b> and <b>hedgerows</b> on maize biomass accumulation, nitrogen concentration and light use efficiency, (iii) to evaluate the competition between maize hedges at crop-soil-hedge interface, (iv) to explore possible mitigating options to cope with competition between hedge and maize by using a modelling approach. A field trial was laid out in randomized complete block design with three replicates at Queen Sirikit research farm, Ban Bo Wi village (13 ° 28 ´ N and 99 ° 15 ´ E), Suan Phueng District, Ratchaburi province in western Thailand with 20 - 25 % slope magnitude. The experiment was established in 2009 while the research presented here was carried out during the 2010 and 2011 maize growing seasons. Six cropping treatments with following management practices were investigated: (T 1, control) maize [Zea mays L.) monocrop, tillage, with fertilizer application (farmers practice; (T 2) maize intercropped with chili (Capsicum annuum L. cv. Super Hot), tillage and fertilizer application; (T 3) maize intercropped with chili, minimum tillage, fertilizer application, and Jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis (DC) L.) relay cropping; (T 4) maize intercropped with chili, minimum tillage, fertilizer application, Jack bean relay cropped, and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit) hedgerows; (T 5) and (T 6) as (T 3) and (T 4), respectively, but both without fertilizer application. Tillage was carried out manually by hoe to around 0 - 20 cm depth. Plots were 13 x 4 m. Fertilizer was applied to maize at a rate of 62, 22, 36 kg ha- 1 of N, P, and K, respectively. Urea (N) application to maize was done in two splits as 31 kg ha- 1 of N one month after sowing maize and another split of 31 kg ha- 1 of N two months after sowing maize Chili received 92 kg N ha- 1 at the time of transplanting and 92 kg ha- 1 N as top dressing one month after transplanting. The impact of competition at the crop-soil-hedge interface was studied in 2011, two years after establishment of soil conservation measures, to exclude the establishment period of leucaena with a potentially weak impact on maize. At this time, highest above ground biomass (AGB) production of maize of 1364 g m- 2 was witnessed in T 2 being statistically different from all other treatments, except T 4 and T 3; while lowest above ground biomass production of 1034 g m- 2 was observed in T 5. In hedgerow treatments, maize rows planted distant to hedges produced 46 % and 73 % higher AGB than maize growing in rows close to the hedgerow (p&# 8804; 0. 0001) in T 4 and T 6, respectively. Similar effects were observed for plant height, grain nitrogen concentration and grain yield. Mean grain &# 948; 13 C was significantly higher in T 6 (- 9. 32 ) than in T 4 (- 10. 49 ) and T 1 (- 10. 55 ). Generally, higher &# 948; 13 C signals mean higher water availability; however the higher &# 948; 13 C signals in unfertilized T 6 treatment imply that lack of nutrients may have led to increased &# 948; 13 C values. Similarly in T 4, &# 948; 13 C signals were significantly higher in maize grains originating form rows planted close to hedges (10. 33 , p&# 8804; 0. 0001) than samples obtained from maize rows distant to hedges (- 10. 64 ). These results point out that competition at the crop-soil-hedge interface was driven by nutrient rather than water limitation. The electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) imaging further supported this finding showing that maize monocrop showed higher soil moisture depletion patterns than hedge intercrop with fertilizer (T 4) treatment, while hedge intercrop without fertilization (T 6) depleted soil moisture least. Light use efficiency (LUE) for maize above ground biomass production was statistically higher LUEAGB (1. 56 g DM MJ- 1) in maize and chilli intercrop (T 2) than in maize sole cropping LUEAGB (1. 23 g DM MJ- 1). In T 4 and T 6 maize rows planted close to hedgerows had lower LUEAGB than rows distant to hedgerows. The land equivalent ratio showed that inclusion of hedgerows with fertilizer application in the intercropping treatment enhanced land utilization by 21 %. The Water, Nutrient and Light Capture in Agroforestry (WaNuLCAS) model simulated AGB with R 2 = 0. 83, RMSE= 6. 3, EF= 0. 82 and CD= 1. 4 during calibration while model validation also showed promising results with R 2 = 0. 76, P< 0. 001, RMSE= 4. 6 and EF= 0. 69. Simulations also pointed to major nutrient limitation between maize rows planted close to hedgerows. Simulations showed that negative impacts of hedgerows on crops can be reduced by managing fertilizer application in hedge adjacent maize rows leading to a successful application of agroforestry systems on a long-term basis not only for soil conservation but also for sustainable crop production in tropical uplands. The study figured out the scope of stable isotopic discrimination, ERT, light use efficiency and modelling approaches for evaluating resource use competition at crop-soil-hedge interface on hillside agriculture. The combination of isotopic discrimination and ERT measurements provided useful information for identification of cause-impact relationships. Spatial LUE patterns provided insights for canopy light harvest under various soil conservation options. Furthermore, light use data was also helpful in validation of WaNuLCAS model which did not only provide multiple options to figure out resource use competition at crop-soil-hedge interface but also allowed to test mitigation options for sustainable crop production in tropical uplands. Model scenarios showed that negative impacts of hedgerows on crops growing close to hedges can be reduced by applying minute additional doses of fertilizer only to the crop rows planted close to hedgerows, leading to a sustainable crop production along with soil conservation. Productivity evaluation of investigated cropping systems showed that inclusion of <b>hedgerows</b> and <b>intercropping</b> in tropical hillside agriculture is promising in enhancing crop production and thus can be adopted by farmers with yield advantage. Auf Grund des intensiven Anbaus von Marktfrüchtenfür hochwertige Lebensmittel, Futtermittel, Fasern und des Kraftstoffbedarfsfür eine wachsende Bevölkerung, steht Thailands westliches Hochland vor schwerem Bodenabtrag und Problemen mit Oberflächenabfluss. Das Landesentwicklungsministerium und der Internationale Rat für Bodenforschung und Management in Thailand fördert daher die Verwendung von Bodenschutzmaßnahmen wie Konturhecken, Grasbarrieren und Agroforstsystemen auf Basis von Obstbäumen und einjährigen Kulturen. Da die Einbeziehung von Bäumen die Anbauflächen verkleinert und es zur Konkurrenz um die verfügbaren Ressourcen mit den Feldfrüchten kommt, sind Landwirte oft zögerlich bei der Anwendung solcher Praktiken, obwohl sich diese Maßnahmen als effektiv bei der Kontrolle von Bodenerosion erwiesen haben. Um Bodenschutzsysteme für Landwirte attraktiver zu gestalten, ist daher ein besseres Verständnis der zugrunde liegenden Prozesse an der Schnittstelle von Feldfrucht, Boden und Heckeerforderlich. In dieser Studie wurde die Hypothese aufgestellt, dass Bodenschutzsysteme mit Hecken und Mischkulturen räumliche Muster der Ressourcennutzung induzieren, welche mit Konkurrenz in Zusammenhang gebracht werden können, wohingegen die Pflanzmuster Bodenbedeckungseigenschaften und Lichtverteilung beeinflussen. Diese Studie konzentrierte sich auf die folgenden Ziele; (i) Verbesserung des Verständnisses des Konkurrenz an der Schnittstelle von Feldfrucht, Boden und Hecke durch die Kombination der 13 C Isotopendiskriminierungsmethode, elektrische Widerstandstomographie und Zeitdomänenreflektometrie, (ii) die Auswirkungen von Mischkulturen und Hecken auf die Biomasseakkumulation von Mais, Stickstoff-Konzentration und Lichtnutzungseffizienz zu untersuchen, (iii) die Konkurrenz zwischen Maishecken und der Schnittstelle von Feldfrucht, Boden und Hecke zu bewerten,(iv) mit Hilfe eines Modellierungsansatz mögliche vorbeugende Maßnahmen untersuchen, um die Konkurrenz zwischen Hecke und Mais zu bewältigen.

40|$|AbstractThe use of food-crop intercropping, <b>hedgerow</b> <b>intercropping</b> and {{secondary}} or cover cropping to increase incomes of resource-poor farmers in South East Asia was investigated. Since all systems improve conservation of nutrients and most give extra marketable produce, {{they were expected}} to increase farm profitability. On upland farms in Lampung, South Sumatra, both inter- {{and secondary}} crops were found to improve yields compared with cassava monocropping and thus the income derived from growing cassava or rice with maize. These increases were equivalent to between 70 and 440 US dollars per hectare. An economic analysis of the lowland rice-producing systems in North East Thailand suggested that with the exception of growing cowpea, the use of pre-rice cover crops was not profitable despite a substantial increase in rice yield, because the additional labour cost more than the additional income was worth. A benefit of leguminous crops, however, can be the extra marketable product. Groundnut in Indonesia and cowpea in Thailand gave an attractive extra US$ 400 – 1150 total income increase per hectare per year (i. e. extra yield of the main food crop plus extra marketable produce from the secondary crop) even after the additional costs were deducted. <b>Hedgerow</b> <b>intercropping</b> gave smaller profit margins of about US$ 90. Although both <b>hedgerow</b> <b>intercropping</b> and secondary cropping represent a considerable investment of labour by farmers, this investment may be more feasible than paying for fertilizer on credit.

40|$|AbstractThree {{types of}} {{cropping}} systems, cassava-based intercropping, <b>hedgerow</b> <b>intercropping</b> and legume cover crop rotations, were evaluated in 1994 – 1997 in Northern Lampung, Sumatra. The {{purpose of this}} experiment was to quantify the C and N flows returned within and transported out of plots and crop yields of different cropping systems. Cassava-based systems were not stable and yields declined over time. Intercropping cassava with rice increased cassava fresh tuber weight by 5 – 48 % compared to the monocrop-ping system. The <b>hedgerow</b> <b>intercropping</b> gave lower maize, rice, groundnut and cowpea yields than could be obtained in a crop rotation with legume cover crops. Maize grain yields in the 80 – 20 rice/maize mixture were about 0. 4 Mg ha− 1 in the rice — groundnut rotation and about half as much when intercropped with cassava or hedgerows. Rice yields intercropped with cassava or with hedgerows were about 1 Mg ha− 1 less in year 2 and 3 than those grown in rotation with groundnut.

However, competition for water and nutrients between crops and associated hedgerows may reduce the overall performance of contour hedgerow systems. In order to make it a good alternative for traditional monocropping systems, the nature and mechanisms driving this competition need to be understood. To get a more detailed understanding of the competition for water, monitoring of the water fluxes in the soil-plant-atmosphere system is necessary.

Furthermore, low soil fertility and general environmental degradation has contributed to the build-up of the parasitic weed Striga hermonthica. Improved cropping systems have to be introduced to address the interrelated problems of declining soil fertility and Striga infestation. Two studies were performed in the highlands of western Kenya, one with improved fallows with Sesbania sesban, and one with <b>hedgerow</b> <b>intercropping.</b> Farmers can use Sesbania not only for soil improvement, but also for fuelwood, poles and fodder. Maize (Zea mays L.) yields and levels of Striga infestation on farm land were assessed after improved fallows with leguminous tree/shrub Sesbania sesban. Six experimental treatments were arranged in a phased entry, and randomized complete block design. The treatments were 6 and 18 month improved fallow, 6 and 18 month natural fallow consisting of regrowth of natural vegetation without cultivation, continuous maize cropping with and without fertilizer application. Results showed that improved fallows increased maize yield relative to continuous unfertilized maize. The results also indicated that a new rotation of Sesbania could be recommended after 2 - 3 seasons to improve maize production. Short-duration natural fallows were ineffective. The 6 and 18 month improved fallow produced 21 t ha⁻¹ and 61 t ha⁻¹ Sesbania biomass, respectively. The high production of Sesbania biomass was an added benefit to this type of improved fallow systems. Striga plant populations were not significantly affected.

40|$|The {{potential}} of agroforestry to alleviate {{problems related to}} scarcities of arable land, water, food and fuel wood is subject to understanding system functioning and implementing and managing an efficiently designed system. The objectives {{of this study were}} to understand interactions and productivity of a <b>hedgerow</b> <b>intercropping</b> system with reference to water and radiation use, and analyse system design and management scenarios in order to enhance returns. Field trials monitoring soil water, solar radiation and plant productivity were conducted during 2006 - 2008 at Ukulinga Research Farm (KwaZulu Natal, South Africa) using a Jatropha-Kikuyu (Pennisetum clandestinum) <b>hedgerow</b> <b>intercropping</b> system as case study. In order to extrapolate results, a process-based <b>hedgerow</b> <b>intercropping</b> model was developed by building intercropping and tree growth into the SWB- 2 D model. Data collected from the field trials were used to parameterise and evaluate the model, which was used to analyse hedgerow orientation and spacing to determine income scenarios of virtual system and to help develop design criteria. Allometric relationships of Jatropha using basal stem diameter and crown width as predictor variables were found to be very reliable. Stem diameter was linearly related with wood and branch proportions and inversely proportional to foliage. Neither below-ground (BG) interspecies competition nor tree spacing had any significant effects on allometry. Allometric equations were proven valid for accurate, non-destructive and rapid predictions of tree growth under various growing and non-destructive canopy management conditions. When interspecies competition was present, none of the tree spacing/arrangement options tested resulted in consistently highest tree relative growth rates (RGR). Treatments had no effect on tree RGR when high water availability and kikuyu dormancy coincided. The single-row treatment (SR) produced the shortest trees, but generally had the highest stem RGR during low rainfall periods. The standard-spacing treatment (SS) had the highest RGR during the spring and summer seasons. Jatropha-only treatment (JO) trees were the tallest and biggest. Treatments affected post-pruning tree height increase, even when rainfall was high. Length of tree-crop interface (TCI) generally decreased tree yield, especially as trees matured toward their maximum-yield age (4 - 5 years). SR trees showed slow response to pruning due to a high TCI. They, however, exhibited compensatory growth during May to August, when competition for water with grass was low. BG competition reduced tree nut yield more than tree biomass. Tree spacing/arrangements had no effect on tree harvest index. Soil water varied among treatments and was asymmetrically distributed across tree hedgerows. System ET was generally the highest in SR and lowest in the double-row treatment (DR). Differences were mainly due to transpiration. Treatments affected tree root distribution, which was inferred using correlations between tree RGR and soil water deficit (SWD). In JO and SR, fine tree roots were asymmetrically distributed. Their distribution in DR was essentially symmetrical. Strong vegetative RGR-SWD correlations during the 2007 / 08 season indicated that tree growth was mainly water-limited. Though DR and SR had comparable tree RGRs, DR produced less grass than SR. This implied DR had more intensive BG competition than SR. Interspecific competition was severe {{due to a lack of}} temporal complementarity between Jatropha and kikuyu and a shallow soil profile (0. 6 m). Tree water uptake predominantly came from the 0. 2 – 0. 6 depth, which had about 8. 6 % of the total root biomass in the profile. There was no clear relationship between intercrop growth and root distribution. Radiation use efficiency of kikuyu decreased towards tree hedgerows possibly due to preceding interaction of the irradiance with tree canopy reducing photosynthetically active radiation. The effect of radiation distribution on tree-crop (T-C) interactions was mainly to magnify effects of water. Finally, tree spacing/arrangement could be manipulated to optimise radiation and soil water distribution and intercrop growth. Predictions of solar radiation distribution, profile water content and tree water use were quite accurate. In general, intercrop productivity simulations were acceptable. Intercrop growth was overestimated when rainfall was high and underestimated when rainfall was low. During model calibration, tree woody biomass, leaf area index, crown width and nut yield were predicted adequately, while leaf dry mass was overestimated. During model validation, woody biomass and crown width were simulated reasonably well. However, foliage biomass, leaf area index and nut yield were overestimated. Overall, adequacy of the model for simulating tree productivity was established. Using scenario modelling, model capabilities to facilitate design/planning and management of <b>hedgerow</b> <b>intercropping</b> systems and interpretation of model outputs were demonstrated. The model can be used to determine the T-C trade-off that yields maximum income. By selecting best-case row orientation and spacing scenarios using the model, and keeping in mind values of tree and intercrop yields, system returns can be maximised. Tree crown growth can also be predicted in order to decide on the extent and timing of pruning. The present model is applicable to any potential tree-intercrop combination. It should be linked to a nutrient simulator of SWB, its component, and appraised further by considering shade-intolerant and shade-loving crop species, along with evergreen and deciduous tree species. This provides model users with numerous T-C combinations to choose from. Various tree spacing/arrangement options can also be explored using the model in order to realise the full potential and implications of the experimental findings of this study and others.

Treatments were differentiated by presence/absence of kikuyu and arrangement/spacing of Jatropha trees (one, two and three tree hedgerows {{on either side of}} the alley) and had the same tree density (1110 ha 1). When high water availability and kikuyu dormancy coincided, tree growth rates did not significantly differ across treatments. Trees of the treatment without interspecific competition (tree-only) were the tallest. Even when rainfall was high, post-pruning tree height growth rate was affected by belowground (BG) interspecific competition and tree spacing/arrangement. Treatment with a single tree hedgerow between alleys had the most frequent maximum stem growth rate and was the most efficient during limited water availability. Its trees showed slow initial response to pruning due to a high tree-grass interface, followed by compensatory growth when competition for water with grass was low. Generally, length of tree-grass interfaces affected yield inversely especially as trees matured toward their maximum-yield age (4 e 5 years).

Manure was the most resistant to decomposition, losing only 15 percent of its dry matter (DM) in 15 weeks, compared to 41 - 57 percent lost by leucaena prunings. Large quantities of K (up to 104 kg ha- 1) were mineralized from prunings and manure, but Ca and Mg were mostly immobilized. More N and P were released from prunings than from manure, which resulted in net immobilization of these nutrients in the initial stages of decomposition and net mineralization in later stages.

Despite its effectiveness in soil conservation and soil fertility improvement, farmers are reluctant to adopt this practice {{due to the lack}} of immediate monetary returns. The lack of expected nutrient inputs through hedgerow mulch and possible tree-crop competition for essential resources seems to be the main drawbacks. In order to test some of these aspects, a study was carried out to assess the soil fertility status after 4 years of HI on the slopes of the wet zone of Sri Lanka, with a special emphasis on the nutrient redistribution in alleyways due to the establishment of contour hedgerows. After 4 years of HI, some soil chemical parameters such as concentrations of organic C, total N, mineralizable N, and organic P were higher in the SALT-HI plot than that of farmer-managed vegetable plot and the abandoned tea land. However, 4 years of HI on the slopes at Doragalla, some chemical parameters showed a significant position effect down the slope compared to the control sites, with a tendency for accumulating nutrients immediately under the hedges compared to open alleyways, yielding a distinct ‘saw-tooth ’ pattern down the slope. The organic C and total N concentrations were significantly higher under hedges than in the open alleyways, where the crops were grown. This nutrient patchiness was not present in the two control sites without hedgerows. This nutrient patchiness seems to be a direct consequence of establishing hedgerows along contours and hence will be a crucial factor determining the fate of this agroforestry system in Sri Lanka.

N 2 fixation estimates of hedgerow trees over a two year period after establishment were obtained by the 15 N dilution method using Peltophorum dasyrrachis as the non-fixing reference plant. Average yearly tree pruning dry matter and total N yields of the two hedgerow systems {{were not significantly different}} although seasonal differences occurred. Gliricidia obtained a larger (average 51 %) proportion of its N from N 2 fixation than Flemingia (average 25 %) the effect being consistent over the two years. Seasonal variation in the % N derived from N 2 fixation was associated with changes in soil mineral N availability. The amount of N 2 fixed was not significantly different between the two N fixing trees (26 vs. 35 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1 respectively). This was due to the higher total N yield of Flemingia compared to Gliricidia compensating for the smaller proportion of N derived from N 2 fixation. The amount of tree soil N uptake was similar for the two hedgerow systems suggesting that the higher proportion of N derived from N 2 fixation in Gliricidia was probably due to competition for soil mineral N by the associated non-fixing Peltophorum. Rapid temporal and spatial decline in plant available 15 N occurred suggesting that matching of fixing and non-fixing reference plants is important. Compared with estimates of N 2 fixation obtained by the natural abundance method the 15 N dilution method overestimated N 2 fixation by the tree legumes (an average of up to 18 %), however {{the difference between the two}} fixing legume trees was maintained.

Ideal trees for intercropping will take up N from deeper soil layers not accessed by the crop species. Spatiotemporal aspects of tree nitrogen capture niches were investigated within a <b>hedgerow</b> <b>intercropping</b> system by placing 15 N at three depths and monitoring 15 N uptake by trees pruned either 25 or 4 days before application of 15 N. Trees with contrasting rooting patterns (Gliricidia sepium L. and Peltophorum dasyrrachis (Miq.) Kurz) were grown in mixed hedgerows and intercropped with maize (Zea mays L.). Neither species showed significant N uptake during the 5 – 14 days after pruning, even though some shoot regrowth occurred during this time. Mean topsoil (0 – 5 cm depth) root length density of G. sepium was 520 % {{greater than that of}} P. dasyrrachis, whereas total root length (0 – 100 cm depth) of G. sepium was only 450 % greater. On average, G. sepium recovered 15 times as much 15 N as P. dasyrrachis, following application of 15 N at 5 cm depth, but the two species recovered a similar amount following application at 80 cm depth, suggesting that P. dasyrrachis had better niche complementarity with shallow rooting crops. However, both species showed strong plasticity in vertical N uptake pattern in response to competition from establishing maize plants. The species differed in their response: N uptake activity by G. sepium shifted down the soil profile in response to increasing competition from a growing maize crop (uptake from 80 cm depth changed from 4 to 9 % of uptake from 5 cm depth), whereas N uptake by P. dasyrrachis became relatively shallow (uptake from 80 cm depth changed from 305 to 25 % of uptake from 5 cm depth). Niche avoidance and increased competitiveness within the topsoil represent alternative responses to competition. The response displayed may be related to soil fertility in the species’ natural habitat...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} Leucaena leucocephala and L. pallida {{prunings}} and cattle manure on maize nutrient uptake and yield were investigated in a hedgerow inter-cropping {{trial in the}} Ethiopian highlands. Hedgerow inter-cropping (also called alley cropping) is an agroforestry system in which trees are grown in dense hedges between alleys where short-cycle crops are grown. The hedges are pruned periodically during the cropping period and the prunings {{are added to the}} soil as green manure. For each leucaena species, the experiment had 16 treatments resulting from a factorial combination of four levels of leucaena leaf prunings (no prunings applied: first prunings applied; first and second prunings applied: first, second and third prunings (no prunings applied: first prunings applied; first and second prunings applied: first, second and third prunings applied), two levels of air-dried cattle manure (0 and 3 t dry matter ha- 1 and two levels of N fertilizer (0 and 40 kg N ha- 1 as urea). Uptake of N, P and K increased significantly with application of the three nutrient sources, but uptake of Ca and Mg either did not respond or decreased with application of prunings and manure. All the three factors increased maize grain and stover yields significantly, usually with no significant interactions between the factors. At least two applications of prunings were required to significantly increase nutrient uptake and maize yield. Maize in the row closest to the hedge did not respond to these nutrient inputs. It is concluded that <b>hedgerow</b> <b>intercropping,</b> with or without manure application, can increase crop yields moderately (to 2 - 3 t ha- 1 maize grain yields) in the highlands, but P, Ca and Mg may have to be supplied from external sources if they are deficient in the soil. Additional N is still required for higher yields (> 4 t ha- 1 maize grain yields). However, quantification of the competition effects of the trees is also required to confirm these results...|$|E
