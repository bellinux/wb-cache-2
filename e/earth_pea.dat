50|$|Vigna subterranea (also {{known by}} its common names Bambara groundnut, Bambara-bean, Congo goober, <b>earth</b> <b>pea,</b> ground-bean, or hog-peanut) {{is a member of}} the family Fabaceae. The plant {{originated}} in West Africa. Vigna subterranea ripens its pods underground, much like the peanut (also called a groundnut). They can be eaten fresh or boiled after drying.|$|E

5000|$|For the {{attraction}} the Imagineers used {{more than thirty}} tons of recycled crushed glass to [...] "paint" [...] the coral and rockwork in the lagoon. Imagineers also created more than forty colors for the lagoon area such as Yamber (a cross between yam and amber), Mango Mud, Toast, Blue Feint (barely blue), Aqua Jazz, Swamp (dark green/amber), Danger Red, Burning Coal, Split <b>Pea,</b> <b>Earth,</b> Phantom and Peritwinkle.|$|R
40|$|A bstract: Partially <b>earth</b> {{anchored}} (<b>PEA)</b> {{can improve}} the structural safety and economic feasibility of multiple span cable stayed bridge (CSB). The PEA-CSB can restrain axial compressive load acting on a tower and reduce the global buckling length of a stiffened girder. For these reasons, structural members subject to axial forces can be effectively utilized and material quantity required for a steel deck {{can be reduced to}} save construction cost. In this study, the PEA system was verified for its application on a multiple span CSB. The CSB is a four-tower multi-span bridge which has a main span length of 500 m. As high tensile stress was generated {{at the top of the}} bridge decks at the mid-span between two main columns, a hybrid deck system for enhancing the bridge deck sections was proposed. While the composite sections made of concrete and steel were used near to the main columns, steel sections were used at the mid-span between two main columns...|$|R
50|$|Growing up, their mother, Jan Katana {{played the}} girls a large variety of artists from {{different}} genres, their favorites include 'Stevie Wonder, Luther Vandross, Michael Jackson , Boyz II Men, Chet Baker, Sergio Mendes,The Black Eyed <b>Peas,</b> <b>Earth,</b> Wind & Fire, Michael McDonald, Gorillaz ,Red Hot Chili Peppers and Anastacia. The Katana’s developed an early love and appreciate for world music through these influences,as {{the result of}} this Millie and Hope attended a community 'Vocal collective choir' between ages 9 through to 12, During this time Millie and Hope learned to perfect their vocal dynamic and skill as a musicians.|$|R
2500|$|Before the game, {{performances}} {{came from}} the Black Eyed <b>Peas,</b> <b>Earth</b> Wind & Fire, Charlie Daniels, John Fogerty, and Gretchen Wilson. Shortly before kickoff, Alicia Keys sang [...] "America the Beautiful," [...] paying tribute to Ray Charles, who died in June 2004. The combined choirs of the U.S. Military Academy, the U.S. Naval Academy, the U.S. Air Force Academy, and the U.S. Coast Guard Academy (including members of The Idlers) sang the national anthem accompanied by the U.S. Army Herald Trumpets. This {{was the first time}} in more than 30 years that all four service academies sang together—the last time was at the second inauguration of President Richard Nixon in 1973.|$|R
5000|$|After graduating, Gandelman joined Monteiro in a {{world tour}} with Baby Face, where his career took off. He moved to California and {{alongside}} Ray, Randy Ellis and Garrett Smith, started The Horns. The four musicians have been playing together since 2003 The Horns have since played {{with some of the}} biggest names in the music business, including Christina Aguilera, Prince, the Jonas Brothers, Stevie Wonder, Sting; James Brown, The Black Eyed <b>Peas,</b> <b>Earth,</b> Wind and Fire, James Taylor; Babyface, Whitney Houston, B.B. King, Diana Ross, Justin Timberlake, Jamie Foxx, Alicia Keys, Mariah Carey, John Mayer, Jennifer Hudson, Patti Labelle, Aretha Franklin and Shakira. The Horns were featured in Christina Aguilera's [...] "Back to Basics Tour" [...] as well as the Jonas Brothers' World tour in 2009.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose to}} use {{low-cost}} optics equipment {{in order to}} (1) generate a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for the 24 brightest stars visible in Beaumont, (2) analyze the polarization of stellar and solar light and the effect a telescope's optics have on these measurements, and (3) analyze the absorption spectrum due to Earth’s atmosphere on the Sun’s blackbody radiation spectrum. Objectives Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram (HRD) : Generate a Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram, using blackbody curves of radiancy for the most visible stars in the northern night sky. Analysis of Polarized Stellar Light (APSL) : Analyze the polarized light emitted from very bright stars and the Sun, due {{to the shape of}} the stars; and study the effects of the optical components of the telescope by placing the solid polarizer at different locations along the line of sight. Pollutants in <b>Earth's</b> Atmosphere (<b>PEA)</b> : Separate from the solar spectrum the absorption spectrum of the gaseous components in the atmosphere in order to determine their chemical compositions. Experiment Set-up Preparation and Brief Progress Report For the three experiments (HRD, APSL, and PEA), a similar experimental technique is used. The set-up is comparable to the one currently used in Lamar University's advanced optics course [1] and shown in Figure 1. The most distinct difference between the set-up shown and the one we are using is the variety of light sensors required for the range of temperatures of the stars we are studying. All three experiments will use PASCO ® equipmen...|$|R
