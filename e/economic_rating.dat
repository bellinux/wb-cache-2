McCain fleshed out the main points of his {{economic}} plan in an April 15, 2008 speech at Carnegie Mellon University in Pennsylvania. In summary, McCain would make the Bush tax cuts permanent instead of letting them expire, he would eliminate the Alternative Minimum Tax in order to assist the middle-class, he would double the personal exemption for dependents, reduce the corporate tax rate, and offer a new research and development tax credit. At the same time, he pledges to eliminate pork-barrel spending, freeze nondefense discretionary spending {{for a year or}} more, and reduce Medicare growth. He is also opposed to extravagant salaries and severance deals of corporate CEOs. In 2013, the National Journal gave McCain an <b>economic</b> <b>rating</b> of 61% conservative and 38% liberal.|$|E

40|$|Various estimates, both ex ante and ex post, {{have been}} {{produced}} of the accounting {{rate of return on}} investments in the late nineteenth-century coal industry, with some ex post figures also being calculated for individual firms engaged therein, such as the Consett Iron Co.

50|$|The Bolivian {{economy has}} had a {{historic}} pattern of a single-commodity focus. From silver to tin to coca, Bolivia has enjoyed only occasional periods of economic diversification.

40|$|Stock market {{volatility}} {{is a matter}} of great interest for researchers and policy makers. The present study examines the volatility of daily, weekly and monthly stock returns in view of <b>economic</b> growth <b>rate.</b> It investigates the hypothesis that high <b>economic</b> growth <b>rate</b> tend to stabilize the investment decisions and create certainty among the investors. Under such situations, investors prevent to alter their investment decisions spontaneously with regard to good or bad news. A low growth rate, on the other hand, makes their investment decisions highly volatile. The study examines the Bombay stock exchange listed index BSE 100 data for the period from 1996 through 2007, wherein Indian economy has registered high and low growth rates. It also examines additional aspect of volatility with regards to expected and unexpected variations in stock returns by applying AR(1) -GARCH(1, 1) model. The findings report that investors are not sensitive to <b>economic</b> growth <b>rate</b> for short period but they become largely sensitive with the long investment horizons. The direct observations can be made here, volatility is invariable to <b>economic</b> growth <b>rate</b> in short time period but investors with long investment horizons are largely affected by <b>economic</b> growth <b>rate.</b> Briefly, high volatility tends to associate with low <b>economic</b> growth <b>rate</b> and low volatility is associated with high <b>economic</b> growth <b>rate...</b>|$|R
40|$|Parties {{needing to}} monitor the {{financial}} performance of not-for-profit (NFP) organizations have traditionally relied upon financial ratios of accounting data. This practice can lead to misleading inferences about profitability in relation to organizational needs, since accounting rates of return are potentially poor proxies for <b>economic</b> <b>rates</b> of return. In this paper we show how {{to compensate for the}} imprecision of the accounting rate of return {{through the use of a}} simple interpretive rule based on the finding that accounting and <b>economic</b> <b>rates</b> of return are on the same side of the growth rate. According to our rule, the accounting rate of return must exceed the asset growth rate in order to sustain growth with internally-generated cash flow. Logistic regressions are used to test the rule's ability to predict sustainable asset growth in a sample of NFP hospitals. The findings not only validate the rule, but also show that the rule exploits all usable information contained in the accounting rate of returnAccounting <b>rate</b> of return; <b>Economic</b> <b>rate</b> of return; Growth, Not-for-profit, JEL classifications: G 30, L 31, M 40,...|$|R
