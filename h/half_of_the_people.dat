25|$|In the United States, {{prostate}} cancer that is local or regional {{at the time}} of diagnosis has a 5-year survival rate of nearly 100%, while those with distant metastases have a 5-year survival rate of 29%. In Japan, death from {{prostate cancer}} was one-fifth to one-half the rates in the United States and Europe in the 1990s. In India in the 1990s, <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> with prostate cancer confined to the prostate died within 19 years. African-American men have 50–60 times more prostate cancer and prostate cancer deaths than men in Shanghai, China. In Nigeria, 2% of men develop prostate cancer, and 64% of them are dead after 2 years. Most Nigerian men present with metastatic disease with a typical survival of 40 months.|$|E
25|$|By 1973, {{problems}} with the estate were becoming apparent; the walkways of the deck level created dangerously isolated areas which became hotspots for crime and robbery, and provided easy escape routes for criminals. The housing was poorly maintained, and suffered badly from water leakages, pest infestations and electrical faults. More than <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> offered accommodation in the estate refused it, {{and the majority of}} existing residents had applied to be re-housed elsewhere. In 1976, less than ten years after the estate opened, the Department of the Environment concluded that the estate was of such poor quality that the only solution was demolition. This decision was unwelcome to residents, and relations between the community and the local authority became increasingly confrontational. A process of regeneration began in 1981, but it was hampered by a lack of funds and an increasingly negative public perception of the area.|$|E
500|$|Although lightly populated, {{recreation}} brings outdoor enthusiasts to the Gaviota Coast. The spill affected {{visitors to}} {{both public and}} private facilities in the area. The state closed heavily used El Capitán State Beach for a month, which was finally reopened on June 26 for camping and day use. Refugio State Beach was more heavily damaged and did not reopen until July 17, 2015. These two popular parks quickly filled up with summer crowds when they reopened. Eric Hjelstrom, California State Parks sector superintendent said, “We were booked full the day we opened. <b>Half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> didn’t know we had been closed, which is a good testament to how clean the park was.” ...|$|E

500|$|The Ancestral Puebloans {{relied on}} regular {{rainfall}} {{to sustain their}} agricultural society. This proved challenging in Chaco Canyon, even with consistent precipitation. By 1130, the rains had diminished and the maize crops that the Chacoans depended on had begun to fail, as the region increasingly suffered {{from the effects of}} a devastating, fifty-year drought. After a continuous occupation of more than six hundred years, the Chacoans began to migrate from the canyon. Fagan states that by 1140 [...] "Chaco was finished". A study of 12th-century burials in the Gallup, New Mexico, area indicates as many as <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> who lived during the drought died before the age of eighteen, with sixty percent of all deaths occurring before age thirty-five. The study estimated that for every woman, four children were needed to sustain the agriculture workforce.|$|E

Mild to increasingly severe physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms may occur upon abstinence, with greater than 100mg caffeine per day; some symptoms associated with psychological dependence may also occur during withdrawal. Caffeine dependence can involve withdrawal {{symptoms such as}} fatigue, headache, irritability, depressed mood, reduced contentedness, inability to concentrate, sleepiness or drowsiness, stomach pain, and joint pain. Withdrawal headaches are experienced by roughly half of those who stop consuming caffeine for two days following an average daily intake of 235mg.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{customers}} {{complained that}} AOL personnel ignored their demands to cancel service and stop billing. In response to approximately 300 consumer complaints, the New York Attorney General's office began an inquiry of AOL's customer service policies. The investigation {{revealed that the}} company had an elaborate scheme for rewarding employees who purported to retain or [...] "save" [...] subscribers who had called to cancel their Internet service. In many instances, such retention was done against subscribers' wishes, or without their consent. Under the scheme, customer service personnel received bonuses worth {{tens of thousands of dollars}} if they could successfully dissuade or [...] "save" [...] <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> who called to cancel service. For several years, AOL had instituted minimum retention or [...] "save" [...] percentages, which consumer representatives were expected to meet. These bonuses, and the minimum [...] "save" [...] rates accompanying them, had the effect of employees not honoring cancellations, or otherwise making cancellation unduly difficult for consumers.|$|E
2500|$|After an {{investigation}} of the test, Australian psychologist Gina Perry re-evaluated Milgram's data and stated that Milgram had manipulated his results. [...] "Overall, over half disobeyed," [...] Perry stated. She found, contrary to the popular version, that there is a [...] "troubling mismatch between (published) descriptions of the experiment and evidence of what actually transpired". She concludes, that many subjects didn't in fact believe in the reality of the experiments, that [...] "at some level, they'd seen through the ruse" [...] and that it is [...] "more truthful to say that only <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> who undertook the experiment fully believed it was real, and of those, two-thirds (i.e. some 66 percent of all) disobeyed the experimenter". On the Holocaust connection, Perry writes: [...] "You have this neat analogy (with the Holocaust). But without that rhetorical framework, Milgram's experiments become no more than reality TV. It's clothed as science and, once clothed as science, you can sell it as science. The rhetorical framing is crucial to the survival of the obedience studies." ...|$|E
2500|$|Benjamin Valentino {{says that}} the Great Leap Forward was a cause of the Great Chinese Famine and that the worst effects of the famine were steered towards the regime's enemies. Those labeled as [...] "black elements" [...] (religious leaders, rightists, rich peasants, etc.) in any earlier {{campaign}} died in the greatest numbers, as they were given the lowest priority in the allocation of food. In Mao's Great Famine, [...] historian Frank Dikötter writes that [...] "coercion, terror, and systematic violence were the very foundation of the Great Leap Forward" [...] and it [...] "motivated {{one of the most}} deadly mass killings of human history." [...] His research in local and provincial Chinese archives indicates the death toll was at least 45 million, and that [...] "In most cases the party knew very well that it was starving its own people to death." [...] In a secret meeting at Shanghai in 1959, Mao issued the order to procure one third of all grain from the countryside. He said: “When there is not enough to eat people starve to death. It is better to let <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> die so that the other half can eat their fill.” Dikötter estimates that at least 2.5 million people were summarily killed or tortured to death during this period.|$|E
