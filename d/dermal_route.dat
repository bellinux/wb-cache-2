5000|$|Dermal {{application}} of a medication or chemical allows treatment to be localized, unlike ingestion or injection. Some medications {{seem to be more}} effective (or are more efficient) using the <b>dermal</b> <b>route</b> of administration. Some ingested drugs are heavily metabolized by the liver and may be inactivated, but using a dermal application bypasses this metabolism step allowing more parent compound to enter the peripheral circulation. If a drug is absorbed well through the skin it may be used as a means of systemic medication. Dermal dosage forms include: liniments, braces, lotions, ointments, creams, dusting powders, aerosols, and transdermal patches. [...] Specially designed patches are currently used to deliver fentanyl, nicotine and other compounds. Slower skin absorption versus oral or injectable may allow patches to provide medication for 1 to 7 days.

Because the <b>dermal</b> <b>route</b> is so important to characterizing occu-pational risk, methods to improve the accuracy of dermal absorption estimates are suggested, including the use of human subjects to study dermal absorption. Additional suggestions include tailoring dermal, oral and inhalation kinetic study designs to reflect worker exposure dosages.

40|$|Acute {{systemic}} toxicity data (LD 50 values) and hazard classifications derived in the rat following oral administration and dermal application have been analysed {{to examine whether}} or not orally-derived hazard classification or LD 50 values {{can be used to}} determine dermal hazard classification. Comparing the oral and dermal classifications for 335 substances derived from oral and dermal LD 50 values respectively revealed 17 % concordance, and indicated that 7 % of substances would be classified less severely while 76 % would be classified more severely if oral classifications were applied directly to the <b>dermal</b> <b>route.</b> In contrast, applying the oral LD 50 values within the dermal classification criteria to determine the dermal classification reduced the concordance to 15 % and the relative ‘under-classification’ to 1 %, but increased the relative ‘over-classification’ to 84 %.

40|$|Earthworms {{may take}} up {{chemicals}} from soil and pore water, both through their skin (dermal) and by ingestion (oral). It remains unclear, however, what {{the relative importance}} of these pathways is. To assess bioavailability of pollutants in soil to earthworms, it is necessary that the contribution of each pathway is known. Lumbricus rubellus were sealed by means of medical histoacryl glue, to block ingestion of soil particles and pore water. For 6 d, these earthworms showed good survival and vitality and no soil ingestion was found. Equal metal uptake was found by sealed and unsealed earthworms exposed to an inert sand matrix continuously flushed with contaminated water. Therefore, pore water uptake via ingestion contributes little to metal accumulation. Uptake rates of Cd, Cu and Pb in sealed and unsealed earthworms exposed to two contaminated field soils were similar. Uptake and elimination kinetics of Zn were significantly lower in sealed earthworms exposed to one of the two field soils. Body concentrations of Cu and Pb could be completely attributed to the <b>dermal</b> <b>route.</b> For internal Cd and Zn concentrations, however, 0 - 17 and 21 - 30 %, respectively, were derived from ingestion. It is concluded that for metals the <b>dermal</b> <b>route</b> is the uptake route of importance.

We detail in vivo and in vitro methods of quantifying the degree of dermal absorption and discuss a preference for infinite dose data as opposed to finite dose data. The basic mechanisms of the dermal absorption process, routes of chemical entry, and the environmental and physiological factors affecting this process are also reviewed, and we discuss the concepts of surface slick exposure to lipophilic compounds and the adsorption of contaminants to water sediment. After presenting mathematical constructs for calculating the degree of exposure, we present in vitro data concerning skin absorption of polyaromatic hydrocarbons adsorbed to Great Lakes water sediment to show that in a worst-case scenario exposure via the <b>dermal</b> <b>route</b> can be equally important to the oral route. We have concluded that prolonged exposure of the skin, especially under conditions that may enhance dermal absorption (e. g., sunburn) may result in toxicologically significant amounts of certain water contaminants being absorbed.
