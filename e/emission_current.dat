25|$|Where {{materials}} {{are subject to}} field penetration and band bending, a necessary preliminary is to have good theories of such effects (for each different class of material) before detailed theories of CFE can be developed. Where voltage-drop effects occur, then {{the theory of the}} <b>emission</b> <b>current</b> may, {{to a greater or lesser}} extent, become theory that involves internal transport effects, and may become very complex.|$|E
40|$|The {{stationary}} thermionic electron <b>emission</b> <b>currents</b> from heated metals {{are compared}} against an analytical expression derived using a non equilibrium quantum Kappa energy {{distribution for the}} electrons. This later depends on the temperature decreasing parameter κ(T) which can be estimated from the raw experimental data and characterizes {{the departure of the}} electron energy spectrum from the equilibrium Fermi-Dirac statistics. The calculations accurately predict the measured thermionic <b>emission</b> <b>currents</b> for both high and moderate temperature ranges. The Richardson-Dushman law governs the electron emission for large values of Kappa or equivalently, for moderate metal temperatures. The high energy tail in the electron energy distribution function which develops at higher temperatures or lower Kappa parameters, increases the <b>emission</b> <b>currents</b> well over the predictions of the classical expression. This analysis also permits the quantitative estimation of the departure of the metal electrons from the equilibrium Fermi-Dirac statistics. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

The HCA of this invention provides lifetimes of greater than 10, 000 hours, and expected lifetimes of greater than 17, 500 hours, whereas the present state-of-the-art is less than 500 hours at <b>emission</b> <b>currents</b> in excess of 1 Ampere.

25|$|Fowler–Nordheim-type equations, in the J-F form, are (approximate) {{theoretical}} equations derived {{to describe}} the local current density J emitted from the internal electron states in the conduction band of a bulk metal. The <b>emission</b> <b>current</b> density (ECD) J for some small uniform region of an emitting surface is usually expressed as a function J(φ,F) of the local work-function φ and the local barrier field F that characterize the small region. For sharply curved surfaces, J may also depend on the parameter(s) used {{to describe the}} surface curvature.|$|E
25|$|Photoemission {{can occur}} from any material, {{but it is}} most easily {{observable}} from metals or other conductors because the process produces a charge imbalance, and if this charge imbalance is not neutralized by current flow (enabled by conductivity), the potential barrier to emission increases until the <b>emission</b> <b>current</b> ceases. It is also usual to have the emitting surface in a vacuum, since gases impede the flow of photoelectrons and make them difficult to observe. Additionally, the energy barrier to photoemission is usually increased by thin oxide layers on metal surfaces if the metal has been exposed to oxygen, so most practical experiments and devices based on the photoelectric effect use clean metal surfaces in a vacuum.|$|E

40|$|Composite {{films of}} Cu and multiwalled carbon {{nanotubes}} (MWCNTs) were fabricated by an electrodeposition technique, and their field emission properties were examined. Commercially available MWCNTs with various diameters (60 - 150 nm) were used. The microstructure of the composite films was analyzed by {{scanning electron microscopy}} and the field emission properties were measured using a diode-type system. Cu/MWCNT composite films with homogeneous dispersion of MWCNTs were fabricated using each type of MWCNT. Bare MWCNTs were present {{on the surface of}} the composite films and the ends of the protruding tips were fixed by the deposited copper matrix. The composite films produced clear <b>emission</b> <b>currents</b> and the corresponding Fowler-Nordheim (F-N) plots showed that these were field <b>emission</b> <b>currents.</b> The turn-on electric field tended to decrease with decreasing MWCNT diameter.

2500|$|This {{parameter}} Ar {{was introduced}} into CFE theory by Stern, Gossling and Fowler in 1929 (who {{called it a}} [...] "weighted mean area"). For practical emitters, the <b>emission</b> <b>current</b> density used in Fowler-Nordheim-type equations is always the current density at some reference point (though this is usually not stated). Long-established convention denotes this reference current density by the simple symbol J, and the corresponding local field and conversion factor by the simple symbols F and β, without the subscript [...] "r" [...] used above; in what follows, this convention is used.|$|E
2500|$|For metals, the CFE regime {{extends to}} well above room temperature. There are other {{electron}} emission regimes (such as [...] "thermal electron emission" [...] and [...] "Schottky emission") that require significant external heating of the emitter. There are also emission regimes where the internal electrons {{are not in}} thermodynamic equilibrium and the <b>emission</b> <b>current</b> is, partly or completely, determined by the supply of electrons to the emitting region. A non-equilibrium emission process of this kind may be called field (electron) emission if most of the electrons escape by tunneling, but strictly it is not CFE, and is not accurately described by a Fowler-Nordheim-type equation.|$|E
2500|$|The next part of {{this article}} deals with the basic theory of cold field {{electron}} emission from bulk metals. This is best treated in four main stages, involving theory associated with: (1) derivation of a formula for [...] "escape probability", by considering electron tunneling through a rounded triangular barrier; (2) an integration over internal electron states to obtain the [...] "total energy distribution"; (3) a second integration, to obtain the <b>emission</b> <b>current</b> density {{as a function of}} local barrier field and local work function; (4) conversion of this to a formula for current as a function of applied voltage. The modified equations needed for large-area emitters, and issues of experimental data analysis, are dealt with separately.|$|E

2500|$|For a metal emitter, the β−value {{for a given}} {{position}} will be constant (independent of voltage) {{under the}} following conditions: (1) the apparatus is a [...] "diode" [...] arrangement, where the only electrodes present are the emitter {{and a set of}} [...] "surroundings", all parts of which are at the same voltage; (2) no significant field-emitted vacuum space-charge (FEVSC) is present (this will be true except at very high <b>emission</b> <b>current</b> densities, around 109 A/m2 or higher [...] ); (3) no significant [...] "patch fields" [...] exist, as a result of non-uniformities in local work-function (this is normally assumed to be true, but may not be in some circumstances).

Thin films of nanotubes in form of nanotube webs are also used for development of field emission electrodes,. It is shown that by fine-tuning the fabrication parameters, these webs can achieve an optimum density of individual emission sites Double-layered electrodes made by deposition of two layers of these webs with perpendicular alignment towards each other are shown to be able to lower the turn-on electric field (electric field required for achieving an <b>emission</b> <b>current</b> of 10 μA/cm2) down to 0.3 V/μm and provide a stable field emission performance.|$|E
2500|$|The {{solution}} was to add another grid between the screen grid and the main anode, called the suppressor grid (since it suppressed secondary <b>emission</b> <b>current</b> toward the screen grid).

This three-grid tube is called a pentode, meaning five electrodes. The pentode was invented in 1926 by Bernard D. H. Tellegen and became generally favored over the simple tetrode. Pentodes are made in two classes: those with the suppressor grid wired internally to the cathode (e.g. EL84/6BQ5) and those with the suppressor grid wired to a separate pin for user access (e.g. 803, 837). An alternative solution for power applications is the beam tetrode or [...] "beam power tube", discussed below.|$|E
