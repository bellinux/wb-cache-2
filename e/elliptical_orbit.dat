5|$|HD 205739 b is a Jupiter-size planet. The {{estimated}} minimum mass is 1.37 {{times the}} mass of Jupiter. The planet {{has been found to}} orbit its host star every 279.8 days at a distance of 0.896 AU, which is approximately 89.6% of the mean distance between the Sun and the Earth. HD 205739 b has a mildly <b>elliptical</b> <b>orbit,</b> given its orbital eccentricity of 0.27. The planet's <b>elliptical</b> <b>orbit</b> is typical with respect to discovered planets whose orbits are longer than twenty days and have not grown circular because of tidal forces. According to its discoverers, HD 205739 b's elongated orbit causes its surface temperature to fluctuate by up to 100 K.|$|E

5|$|In 1673, Jeremiah Horrocks {{published}} a reasonably accurate {{model of the}} Moon's motion in which the Moon was assumed to follow a precessing <b>elliptical</b> <b>orbit.</b> A sufficiently accurate and simple method for predicting the Moon's motion would have solved the navigational problem of determining a ship's longitude; in Newton's time, {{the goal was to}} predict the Moon's position to 2' (two arc-minutes), which would correspond to a 1° error in terrestrial longitude. Horrocks' model predicted the lunar position with errors no more than 10 arc-minutes; for comparison, the diameter of the Moon is roughly 30 arc-minutes.|$|E
5|$|The average {{distance}} between Saturn and the Sun is over 1.4 billion kilometers (9AU). With an average orbital speed of 9.68km/s, it takes Saturn 10,759 Earth days (or about years), to finish one revolution around the Sun. The <b>elliptical</b> <b>orbit</b> of Saturn is inclined 2.48° {{relative to the}} orbital plane of the Earth. The perihelion and aphelion distances are, respectively, 9.195 and 9.957AU, on average. The visible features on Saturn rotate at different rates depending on latitude and multiple rotation periods have been assigned to various regions (as in Jupiter's case).|$|E
5|$|The {{best fit}} for the shape of HAT-P-33b's orbit {{suggests}} that the orbit is slightly elliptical, as the planet's orbital eccentricity is fit to 0.148.

Most of the planet's defined characteristics are {{based on the assumption that}} HAT-P-33b has an <b>elliptical</b> <b>orbit,</b> although the planet's discoverers have also derived HAT-P-33b's characteristics on the assumption that the planet has a circular orbit.

5|$|HD 154672 b is {{a closely}} {{orbiting}} planet that {{is larger than}} Jupiter. Its mass was estimated as 5.02 that of Jupiter. HD 154672 b also orbits its host star {{at a distance of}} 0.6 AU every 163.91 days. Earth, in comparison, orbits the Sun at a distance of 1 AU every 365.25 days. However, HD 154672 b has an orbital eccentricity of 0.61, which indicates a very <b>elliptical</b> <b>orbit.</b> Because HD 154672 b has such an eccentric orbit, the equilibrium temperature of the planet varies between 300 K and 600 K, which is significantly higher than that of Jupiter (124 K). If liquid water is present in the atmosphere of HD 154672 b, it could possibly convert between gaseous and liquid phases as the planet moves along its orbit.|$|E
5|$|HD 205739 b is an {{extrasolar planet}} located {{approximately}} 350 light-years {{away in the}} constellation of Piscis Austrinus, orbiting the star HD 205739. This planet has a minimum mass 37% more than Jupiter and orbits 90% of {{the distance between the}} Earth and the Sun. The planet has a very <b>elliptical</b> <b>orbit,</b> which has led its discoverers to postulate that the planet's surface temperature varies by about 100 K along the entire orbit. This planet was reported on September 5, 2008 after its discovery at Las Campanas Observatory, where the planet was observed for years by the N2K Consortium while using the Magellan Telescopes. Follow-up observations collected the radial velocity measurements necessary to confirm the candidate as a planet.|$|E
5|$|He {{then set}} about calculating the entire orbit of Mars, using the {{geometrical}} rate law and assuming an egg-shaped ovoid orbit. After approximately 40 failed attempts, in early 1605 he at last hit upon {{the idea of}} an ellipse, which he had previously assumed to be too simple a solution for earlier astronomers to have overlooked. Finding that an <b>elliptical</b> <b>orbit</b> fit the Mars data, he immediately concluded that all planets move in ellipses, with the sun at one focus—Kepler's first law of planetary motion. Because he employed no calculating assistants, however, he did not extend the mathematical analysis beyond Mars. By the end of the year, he completed the manuscript for Astronomia nova, though it would not be published until 1609 due to legal disputes over the use of Tycho's observations, the property of his heirs.|$|E

5|$|In 1984, Physicist Richard A. Muller {{postulated}} that the Sun has a heretofore undetected companion, either a brown dwarf or a red dwarf, in an <b>elliptical</b> <b>orbit</b> within the Oort cloud. This object, known as Nemesis, was hypothesized {{to pass through}} {{a portion of the}} Oort cloud approximately every 26million years, bombarding the inner Solar System with comets. However, to date no evidence of Nemesis or the Oort cloud have been found, and many lines of evidence (such as crater counts), have thrown their existence into doubt. Recent scientific analysis no longer supports the idea that extinctions on Earth happen at regular, repeating intervals. Thus, the Nemesis hypothesis is no longer needed to explain current assumptions.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter is {{the only}} planet whose {{barycenter}} with the Sun lies outside {{the volume of the}} Sun, though by only 7% of the Sun's radius. The average distance between Jupiter and the Sun is 778 millionkm (about 5.2 times the average distance between Earth and the Sun, or 5.2 AU) and it completes an orbit every 11.86years. This is approximately two-fifths the orbital period of Saturn, forming a near orbital resonance between the two largest planets in the Solar System. The <b>elliptical</b> <b>orbit</b> of Jupiter is inclined 1.31° compared to Earth. Because the eccentricity of its orbit is 0.048, Jupiter's distance from the Sun varies by 75 millionkm between its nearest approach (perihelion) and furthest distance (aphelion).|$|E
5|$|Kepler's laws of {{planetary}} motion describe {{the orbits of}} objects about the Sun. Following Kepler's laws, each object travels along an ellipse with the Sun at one focus. Objects closer to the Sun (with smaller semi-major axes) travel more quickly {{because they are more}} affected by the Sun's gravity. On an <b>elliptical</b> <b>orbit,</b> a body's distance from the Sun varies over the course of its year. A body's closest approach to the Sun is called its perihelion, whereas its most distant point from the Sun is called its aphelion. The orbits of the planets are nearly circular, but many comets, asteroids, and Kuiper belt objects follow highly elliptical orbits. The positions of the bodies in the Solar System can be predicted using numerical models.|$|E
5|$|The {{eccentricity}} of {{an orbit}} describes how elongated a planet's orbit is. Planets with low eccentricities have more circular orbits, whereas planets with high eccentricities have more <b>elliptical</b> <b>orbits.</b> The planets in the Solar System have very low eccentricities, and thus nearly circular orbits. Comets and Kuiper belt objects (as {{well as several}} extrasolar planets) have very high eccentricities, and thus exceedingly <b>elliptical</b> <b>orbits.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Elliptical</b> {{geosynchronous}} <b>orbits</b> {{can be and}} {{are designed}} for communications satellites {{in order to keep}} the satellite within view of its assigned ground stations or receivers. A satellite in an <b>elliptical</b> geosynchronous <b>orbit</b> appears to oscillate in the sky from the viewpoint of a ground station, tracing an analemma in the sky. Satellites in highly <b>elliptical</b> <b>orbits</b> must be tracked by steerable ground stations.|$|R
5000|$|The {{eccentricity}} of {{an orbit}} describes how elongated a planet's orbit is.

5|$|The orbital radius {{at which}} the stellar flux from Epsilon Eridani matches the solar constant—where the {{emission}} matches the Sun's output at the orbital distance of the Earth—is 0.61 astronomical units (AU). That is within the maximum habitable zone of a conjectured Earth-like planet orbiting Epsilon Eridani, which currently stretches from about 0.5 to 1.0AU. As Epsilon Eridani ages {{over a period of}} 20billion years, the net luminosity will increase, causing this zone to slowly expand outward to about 0.6–1.4AU. The presence of a large planet with a highly <b>elliptical</b> <b>orbit</b> in proximity to Epsilon Eridani's habitable zone reduces the likelihood of a terrestrial planet having a stable orbit within the habitable zone.|$|E
5|$|This angular scaling {{can be seen}} in the apsidal precession, i.e., in {{the gradual}} {{rotation}} of the long axis of the ellipse (Figure3). As noted above, the orbit as a whole rotates with a mean angular speed Ω=(k−1)ω, where ω equals the mean angular speed of the particle about the stationary ellipse. If the particle requires a time T to move from one apse to the other, this implies that, in the same time, the long axis will rotate by an angle β=ΩT=(k−1)ωT=(k−1)×180°. For an inverse-square law such as Newton's law of universal gravitation, where n equals 1, there is no angular scaling (k=1), the apsidal angle α is 180°, and the <b>elliptical</b> <b>orbit</b> is stationary (Ω=β=0).|$|E
5|$|Based {{on their}} orbital characteristics, short-period comets {{are thought to}} {{originate}} from the centaurs and the Kuiper belt/scattered disc —a disk of objects in the trans-Neptunian region—whereas the source of long-period comets {{is thought to be}} the far more distant spherical Oort cloud (after the Dutch astronomer Jan Hendrik Oort who hypothesised its existence). Vast swarms of comet-like bodies are thought to orbit the Sun in these distant regions in roughly circular orbits. Occasionally the gravitational influence of the outer planets (in the case of Kuiper belt objects) or nearby stars (in the case of Oort cloud objects) may throw one of these bodies into an <b>elliptical</b> <b>orbit</b> that takes it inwards toward the Sun to form a visible comet. Unlike the return of periodic comets, whose orbits have been established by previous observations, the appearance of new comets by this mechanism is unpredictable.|$|E
