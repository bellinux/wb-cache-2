5|$|As a result, Alfonsín {{sponsored}} the Trial of the Juntas, in which, {{for the first}} time, the leaders of a military coup in Argentina were on trial. The first hearings began at the Supreme Court in April 1985 and lasted {{for the remainder of}} the year. In December, the tribunal handed down life sentences for Jorge Videla and former Navy Chief Emilio Massera, as well as 17-year sentences for Roberto Eduardo Viola. President Leopoldo Galtieri was acquitted of charges related to the repression, but he was court-martialed in May 1986 for malfeasance during the Falklands War. Ramón Camps received a 25-year sentence. The trials did not <b>focus</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> the military: Mario Firmenich was captured in Brazil in 1984 and extradited to Argentina. José López Rega was extradited from Miami in 1986, because of his links with the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance.|$|E
5|$|Philosophy of {{psychology}} refers to {{issues at the}} theoretical foundations of modern psychology. Some of these issues are epistemological concerns about the methodology of psychological investigation. For example, is the best method for studying psychology to <b>focus</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> the response of behavior to external stimuli or should psychologists focus on mental perception and thought processes? If the latter, an important question is how the internal experiences of others can be measured. Self-reports of feelings and beliefs may not be reliable because, even in cases {{in which there is}} no apparent incentive for subjects to intentionally deceive in their answers, self-deception or selective memory may affect their responses. Then even in the case of accurate self-reports, how can responses be compared across individuals? Even if two individuals respond with the same answer on a Likert scale, they may be experiencing very different things.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of 2004, Fletcher {{proposed}} changes to the health benefits of state workers and retirees. Fletcher's plan provided discounts for members who engaged in healthier behavior, which he called a transition from a sickness initiative to a wellness initiative. Acknowledging that out-of-pocket expenses would rise, Fletcher proposed a 1% salary increase to offset the additional costs. State employees, particularly public school teachers, broadly opposed Fletcher's plan, and the Kentucky Educators Association called for an indefinite strike, to begin October 27, 2004. To address the opposition, Fletcher called a special session of the legislature to begin October 5, 2004. Although the state was still operating under an executive spending plan, Fletcher did not include the budget or his tax reform proposal in the session's agenda, a move praised by both parties, allowing them to <b>focus</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> concerns over the health plan. In a fifteen-day session, the General Assembly passed a plan that allocated $190 million more to health insurance for state workers and restored many of the most popular benefits in the previous insurance plan. Immediately after the session adjourned, the Kentucky Educators Association voted to cancel their proposed strike.|$|E

25|$|As Wali Khan {{withdrew from}} politics, his {{contact with the}} press and public became limited.

25|$|The {{proportions}} of pupils attending {{schools in the}} Haredi and Arab sectors are increasing; according to a demographic study published in 2009, Haredim and Arabs together will amount to 60% of Israel's elementary school population by 2030. Haredim and Arab citizens are underrepresented in both the Israel Defense Forces and the workforce, since both groups are exempt from the otherwise compulsory military service, and in many Haredi sects men choose to <b>focus</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> religious studies throughout their life and rely financially on support from co-religionists, the State, etc.|$|E
25|$|Criticisms of Bourdieu's concept {{have been}} made on many grounds, {{including}} a lack of conceptual clarity. Perhaps due to this lack of clarity, researchers have operationalised the concept in diverse ways, and have varied in their conclusions. While some researchers may be criticised for using measures of cultural capital which <b>focus</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> certain aspects of 'highbrow' culture, this is a criticism which could also be leveled at Bourdieu's own work. Several studies have attempted to refine the measurement of cultural capital, {{in order to examine}} which aspects of middle-class culture actually have value in the education system.|$|E

25|$|Julius Caesar {{is seen as}} {{the main}} example of Caesarism, a form of {{political}} rule led by a charismatic strongman whose rule is based upon a cult of personality, whose rationale is the need to rule by force, establishing a violent social order, and being a regime involving prominence of the military in the government. Other people in history, such as the French Napoleon Bonaparte and the Italian Benito Mussolini, have defined themselves as Caesarists. Bonaparte did not <b>focus</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> Caesar's military career but also on his relation with the masses, a predecessor to populism. The word is also used in a pejorative manner by critics of this type of political rule.|$|E
25|$|While many {{theories}} on motivation have a mentalistic perspective, behaviorists <b>focus</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> observable behavior and theories founded on experimental evidence. In {{the view of}} behaviorism, motivation is understood as a question about what factors cause, prevent, or withhold various behaviors, while the question of, for instance, conscious motives would be ignored. Where others would speculate about such things as values, drives, or needs, {{that may not be}} observed directly, behaviorists are interested in the observable variables that affect the type, intensity, frequency and duration of observable behavior. Through the basic research of such scientists as Pavlov, Watson and Skinner, several basic mechanisms that govern behavior have been identified. The most important of these are classical conditioning and operant conditioning.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fifth}} era (1994–present), digital {{versions}} {{have been developed}} and released on optical media and online. In 1996, the Britannica was bought by Jacqui Safra at well below its estimated value, owing to the company's financial difficulties. Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. split in 1999. One part retained the company name and developed the print version, and the other, Britannica.com Inc., developed digital versions. Since 2001, the two companies have shared a CEO, Ilan Yeshua, who has continued Powell's strategy of introducing new products with the Britannica name. In March 2012, Britannica's president, Jorge Cauz, {{announced that it would}} not produce any new print editions of the encyclopaedia, with the 2010 15th edition being the last. The company will <b>focus</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> the online edition and other educational tools.|$|E

25|$|Later it was {{discussed}} that a separate branch should {{be created in}} order to handle everything pertaining to the anti-Castro movement. The White House division organized Branch 4 (WH/4)as the new task force to run Cuban Operations. The task force included 40 personnel, with 18 at headquarters, 20 at the Havana station, and 2 at Santiago base. The state department was concerned that if Castro was overthrown then the people to come after him would be worse than him. These people were Che Guevara and Raul Castro. So they proposed {{a way of getting}} a better leader that they approved of in his place. The CIA began to worry that their involvement with the anti-Castro movement would lead to an anti-US movement. On March 14 of 1960, Dulles presented a “General Covert Action Plan for Cuba” that would <b>focus</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> the Cuban problems. Guerrilla capacity in the anti-Castro groups {{both in and out of}} Cuba {{was discussed}}.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, {{members of the}} Missouri General Assembly and Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon again began attacking the {{desegregation}} plan {{on the grounds of}} its costs. Nixon proposed that instead of spending money to transfer students, funds would be better spent improving derelict conditions in city schools, a view supported by St. Louis's first black mayor, Freeman Bosley, Jr.. After another legal challenge to the plan in early 1996 (based on recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings), the court ordered a review of the plan and a second settlement agreement. A settlement plan developed in the Missouri legislature called for reduced state money for the program and a <b>focus</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> funding magnet schools in the city and the voluntary transfer program. All but one of the suburban districts agreed to renew the agreement on these terms (Ladue School District was the exception), and in 1999, the renewed settlement was established. However, under the 1999 agreement, school districts have been permitted to withdraw from the voluntary transfer program starting in 2002, and two districts have done so (Lindbergh School District and Pattonville School District). A five-year extension of the voluntary transfer program was approved in 2007, allowing new enrollments to take place through the 2013–2014 school year in participating districts.|$|E
500|$|During {{the writing}} and {{recording}} of the album, the band encountered several obstacles. Vedder has admitted that while working on the album he suffered from writer's block, which {{made it difficult for}} him to come up with lyrics. This inspired the hidden track [...] "Writer's Block" [...] - which consists of the sounds of a typewriter - that appears {{at the end of the}} album, starting at 6 minutes and 50 seconds on the track [...] "Parting Ways". Vedder had written music for several songs, including [...] "Insignificance" [...] and [...] "Grievance", but was having trouble coming up with lyrics for the songs. He decided to not write any more music, and to <b>focus</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> lyrics, even banning himself from playing guitar. Unable to write more lyrics, Vedder said he saw a ukulele and thought [...] "that's not a guitar," [...] and wrote the song [...] "Soon Forget" [...] using the ukulele. Guitarist Mike McCready went into rehabilitation to receive treatment for an addiction to prescription drugs. Gossard recalled that [...] "everyone wasn't on the same page" [...] due to McCready's absence and the familiarization with Cameron.|$|E
