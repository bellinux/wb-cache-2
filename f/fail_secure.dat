40|$|Abstract: Computer systems 1 {{are subject}} {{to a wide range}} of mishaps- from {{corrupted}} data files, to viruses, to natural disasters. Security systems can also fail due to deliberate attacks by adversaries, or random errors and design failures. It is extremely important to ensure that these failures do not lead to security exposures. This concept is what we refer to as &quot;Fail-Secure. &quot; <b>Fail</b> <b>Secure</b> Procedures (FSPs) are the set of documented and authorized technical, personnel, and organizational measures needed to ensure the security of a security-critical system and its dependent systems even when the system (or part of it) fails. In this paper we present a generic framework for designing FSPs. This framework is independent of any particular system, application environment, system vulnerability, or type of attack. Therefore, it can be applied {{to a wide range of}} practical applications. The framework we present considers technical as well as organizational and human aspects.
