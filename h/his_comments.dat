He met with many conservative Republican senators, and based on assurances he gave them, he was recommended for the Judiciary Committee's chairmanship in late 2004.

5|$|Grissom {{is often}} {{regarded}} as well-educated, but unusual in his approach toward {{his work and}} social life.

5|$|In 1852 Staunton {{published}} his book The Chess Tournament, which recounted {{in detail the}} efforts required to make the London International Tournament happen and presented all the games with <b>his</b> <b>comments</b> on the play.

5|$|Chambers {{reflected}} {{on drug use}} in athletics {{in an interview with}} Olympic gold medallist Sir Matthew Pinsent for the BBC's Inside Sport programme. Chambers claimed there would always be athletes using performance-enhancing drugs because drug testers did not keep pace with advances in science and that athletes who took drugs had an immense advantage over those who remained clean. Chambers was roundly condemned for <b>his</b> <b>comments</b> in the interview by both the press and his former colleagues in the athletics world, including Sir Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah, and Sebastian Coe, although former 100m world record holder Asafa Powell supported Chambers' claims.|$|E
5|$|During the Singer World Series {{tournament in}} Sri Lanka in September 1994, which {{involved}} India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Australia, the Australian team {{stayed at the}} Oberoi Hotel in the capital Colombo. There was a casino {{in close proximity to}} the hotel, which Waugh and Warne visited. Team manager Colin Egar had advised Warne that he had been told that the venue was unsavoury, but he was vague in <b>his</b> <b>comments,</b> and at the time, casinos were not perceived as trouble spots or traps for unwary cricketers.|$|E

In 1924, as Minister for Housing, Denny was {{closely associated with}} the Thousand Homes Scheme, which aimed to provide affordable housing, particularly for returned soldiers and their families, and lower income groups. The land used for this development was the site of the Mitcham military camp at which Denny had trained before embarking for service overseas. Denny's work on the Scheme resulted in a clash with former Premier Sir Henry Barwell, whom he sued for libel after Barwell made statements suggesting that Denny had made false statements to induce merchants to provide goods and services. Barwell later apologised for <b>his</b> <b>comments.</b>|$|E

5|$|Golding left to lead Kent State, {{and with}} a brief {{intermission}} of Academic Vice President Trevor Colbourn serving as president, Thomas B. Day became the sixth president in 1978. When Proposition 13 passed, the school faced budget issues and Day proposed abolishing some departments, combining others, and laying off approximately 80 faculty members. However, budget cuts were deemed not necessary, and on April 8, 1980, Day again proposed cutting 115 faculty members and four departments due to foreseeing upcoming budget cuts; on May 16, 1980 he recanted <b>his</b> <b>comments.</b>|$|E
5|$|However, on 15 March 2016, American comedian Jim Breuer (a {{friend of}} Johnson) {{revealed}} on his podcast that Johnson {{had received a}} second opinion on his hearing {{and it was not}} as bad as initially thought. Nonetheless, Breuer mentioned that Johnson told him that he was essentially fired from AC/DC and that he hadn't heard from the band since the announcement of the tour being postponed, adding that Angus Young wants to continue the band for at least another ten years and do at least one more studio album and world tour. Breuer later clarified <b>his</b> <b>comments</b> on Facebook that did not end speculation on Johnson's future with the band.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Leigh and Laurence Olivier {{performed}} {{two plays}} about Cleopatra, William Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra and George Bernard Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra, alternating the play each night and winning good reviews. They took the productions to New York, where they performed a {{season at the}} Ziegfeld Theatre into 1952. The reviews there were also mostly positive, but film critic Kenneth Tynan angered them when he suggested that Leigh's was a mediocre talent that forced Olivier to compromise his own. Tynan's diatribe almost precipitated another collapse; Leigh, terrified of failure and intent on achieving greatness, dwelt on <b>his</b> <b>comments</b> and ignored the positive reviews of other critics.|$|E
40|$|A {{comment by}} Miller was {{published}} in the August 1989 issue of Environment and Planning A, which makes an intriguing comparison of a paper by Chen and Rose with one by myself. <b>His</b> <b>comment</b> concerns the uses of various terminologies in the literature on supply-driven and demand-driven input - output models and the claims to have defined terms such as 'stability', 'joint stability', and 'consistency'. Further, generalizations are {{made on the basis of}} a specific set of aggregated data for the US economy to show that biproportional changes suggested in my theorem are unlikely to be observed in the real world. I will show that Miller adds no illumination to the issues of 'stability' or 'consistency', and that, in fact, <b>his</b> <b>comment</b> accomplishes nothing of import. <b>His</b> <b>comment</b> could also leave us with the impression that the USA is the only 'real-world' example worthy of comment. ...|$|R
