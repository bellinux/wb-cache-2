Because of the terrible suffering and starvation caused by the original use of the strategy, a formal <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>blockade</b> was deliberately not made, but the communiqué listed the types of contraband of war that was liable for confiscation if carried. It included all kinds of foodstuffs, animal feed, forage, and clothing, and articles and materials used in their production. This was known as Conditional Contraband of War. In addition, there was Absolute Contraband, which constituted: ...|$|E
50|$|One of Justice Nelson’s more noted {{opinions}} {{was issued}} in the Prize Cases, which arose from President Lincoln's <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> a <b>blockade</b> <b>of</b> ports {{in states that}} had declared secession, to be enforced by the Navy. Navy patrolling ships captured blockade runners, which were seized as prizes. The owners sued for return of their ships, claiming that the blockade was illegal because the President {{did not have the}} constitutional authority to declare it.|$|R
50|$|In his Memoirs of Service Afloat, Raphael Semmes {{contended that}} the {{announcement}} <b>of</b> a <b>blockade</b> carried de facto recognition of the Confederate States of America as an independent national entity since countries do not blockade their own ports but rather close them (See Boston Port Act). Under international law and maritime law, however, nations {{had the right to}} stop and search neutral ships in international waters if they were suspected <b>of</b> violating a <b>blockade,</b> something port closures would not allow. In an effort to avoid conflict between the United States and Britain over the searching of British merchant vessels thought to be trading with the Confederacy, the Union needed the privileges of international law that came with the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> a <b>blockade.</b>|$|R

In August Susquahanna participated in the joint army-navy expedition to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. On August 28 the Union naval force, including Susquahanna, bombarded the forts guarding Hatteras Inlet as troops landed. The following day the bombardment continued until the forts finally surrendered. Bankhead criticized the way the attacks were carried out and later wrote Captain Gustavus Fox, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy and an old shipmate, that the forts could have been taken in much less time: ...|$|R
50|$|With 3,500 miles (5,600 km) of Confederate {{coastline}} and 180 possible {{ports of}} entry to patrol, the blockade {{would be the}} largest such effort ever attempted. The United States Navy had 42 ships in active service, and another 48 laid up and listed as available as soon as crews could be assembled and trained. Half were sailing ships, some were technologically outdated, most were at the time patrolling distant oceans, one served on Lake Erie {{and could not be}} moved into the ocean, and another had gone missing off Hawaii. At the time <b>of</b> the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>blockade,</b> the Union only had three ships suitable for blockade duty. The Navy Department, under the leadership of Navy Secretary Gideon Welles, quickly moved to expand the fleet. U.S. warships patrolling abroad were recalled, a massive shipbuilding program was launched, civilian merchant and passenger ships were purchased for naval service, and captured blockade runners were commissioned into the navy. In 1861, nearly 80 steamers and 60 sailing ships were added to the fleet, and the number <b>of</b> <b>blockading</b> vessels rose to 160. Some 52 more warships were under construction {{by the end of the}} year. By November 1862, there were 282 steamers and 102 sailing ships. By the end of the war, the Union Navy had grown to a size of 671 ships, making it the largest navy in the world.|$|R
2500|$|In March 1917, {{following}} the German <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> a submarine <b>blockade</b> around Britain, Mongolia was chartered as an Army transport [...] {{and received a}} self-defense armament of three [...] deck guns manned by U.S. Navy gun crews. One month later, Mongolia became the first American vessel to test the blockade, using those guns to drive off (and possibly sink) a U-boat seven miles southeast of Beachy Head, in the English Channel. That was the first armed encounter for an American vessel after the US's entry to World War I. For the next year, Mongolia ferried American troops and supplies to Europe. Two American nurses, Edith Ayers and Helen Wood, were accidentally killed during one of these crossings, and another was wounded. During the afternoon of 20 May 1917, the nurses were {{on the deck of}} the Mongolia, observing the firing of the aft 6-inch gun, when they were struck by fragments of the shell's brass casing.|$|R
50|$|Before {{the next}} case <b>of</b> <b>blockade</b> {{which can be}} {{described}} as pacific occurred came the <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Paris (April 15, 1856), requiring that blockades in order to be binding must be effective; that is to say, maintained by a force sufficient really to prevent access to the coast of the enemy.|$|R
50|$|The Peruvian <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> {{war against}} Gran Colombia {{occurred}} on 3 July 1828 when the Peruvian Government, under President Jose de La Mar, ordered a mobilization of its ground and naval forces. The first engagement {{of the conflict}} took place on August 31 of that year when the Peruvian corvette Libertad, {{under the command of}} Carlos García del Postigo, on patrol in international waters {{to the west of the}} Gulf of Guayaquil with the purpose <b>of</b> <b>blockading</b> that port, was attacked by the Gran Colombian ships Pichincha and Guayaquileña off Punta Malpelo. The Colombians were forced to retreat with heavy loss of life on board their vessels.|$|R
50|$|Once war was {{declared}} by Chile upon Peru on Saturday, April 5, 1879, the first Chilean naval {{action for the}} War of the Pacific was set in motion. The plan was to block the Peruvian port of Iquique {{the same day the}} <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> war was made. The first phase <b>of</b> the <b>blockade</b> ended on May 21, 1879, after the clashes between the Peruvian ships Huascar and Independencia versus the Chilean ships Esmeralda and Covadonga.|$|R

2500|$|Further {{problems}} {{developed over}} possible diplomatic recognition when, in mid-August, Seward {{became aware that}} Britain was secretly negotiating with the Confederacy {{in order to obtain}} its agreement to abide by the <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Paris. The 1856 <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Paris prohibited signatories from commissioning privateers against other signatories, protected neutral goods shipped to belligerents except for [...] "contrabands of war," [...] and recognized blockades only if they were proved effective.
