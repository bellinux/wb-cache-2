The industrial manufacture of <b>ephedrine</b> in China began in the 1920s, when the American pharmaceutical company Merck began marketing and selling the drug as ephetonin. <b>Ephedrine</b> exports between China and the West grew from 4 tonnes to 216 tonnes between 1926 and 1928.|$|E
5|$|Some jurisdictions {{limit the}} sale of lithium batteries, which are the most readily {{available}} source of lithium for ordinary consumers.

5|$|It {{can also}} be {{produced}} by oxidising the <b>ephedrine</b> analogue 4-methylephedrine using potassium permanganate dissolved in sulfuric acid. Because 4-methylephedrine can be obtained in a specific enantiomeric form, mephedrone consisting of only one enantiomer can be produced. The danger associated with this method is it may cause manganese poisoning if the product is not correctly purified.|$|E
25|$|The main {{differences}} of the synephrine isomers compared for example to the <b>ephedrines</b> are the hydroxy-substitutions on the benzene ring. Synephrines are direct sympathomimetic drugs while the <b>ephedrines</b> are both {{direct and indirect}} sympathomimetics. One {{of the main reasons}} for these differential effects is the obviously increased polarity of the hydroxy-substituted phenyl ethyl amines which renders them less able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier as illustrated in the examples for tyramine and the amphetamine analogs.|$|R

The strategiesto these chiral molecules by classical chemical or chemo-enzymatical syntheses arechallenging and therewith draw interest for industrial research efforts. In this thesis,the potential of enzyme cascades for the synthesis of chiral primary vicinal aminoalcohols was demonstrated. In detail, the 2 -step cascades combining thiaminediphosphate (ThDP) -dependent enzymes and ω-transaminases were investigated forthe synthesis of nor(pseudo) <b>ephedrines.</b> This approach represents a completely newstrategy for getting access to chiral amino alcohols.

5|$|This {{treatise}} documented a {{wide range}} of pharmaceutical practices, including the use of <b>ephedrine</b> as a drug. It includes valuable information on metallurgy and the steel and iron industries during 11th century China. He created a systematic approach to listing various different minerals and their use in medicinal concoctions, such as all the variously known forms of mica {{that could be used to}} cure ills through digestion. He wrote of the subconchoidal fracture of native cinnabar, signs of ore beds, and provided description on crystal form. Similar to the ore channels formed by circulation of ground water written of by the later German scientist Georgius Agricola, Su Song made similar statements concerning copper carbonate, as did the earlier Rihua Bencao of 970 with copper sulphate. Su's book was also the first pharmaceutical treatise written in China to describe the flax, Urtica thunbergiana, and Corchoropsis tomentosa (crenata) plants. According to Edward H. Schafer, Su accurately described the translucent quality of fine realgar, its origin from pods found in rocky river gorges, its matrix being pitted with holes and having a deep red, almost purple color, and that the mineral varied in sizes ranging from the size of a pea to a walnut.|$|E

25|$|The first {{clinical}} {{use of the}} drug was documented in 1917, the year after it was first developed. It was first introduced to the US market in May 1939. In early 1928, Merck introduced a combination product containing scopolamine, oxycodone, and <b>ephedrine</b> under the German initials for the ingredients SEE, which was later renamed Scophedal (SCOpolamine <b>ePHEDrine</b> and eukodAL). This combination is essentially an oxycodone analogue of the morphine-based ´twilight sleep´, with <b>ephedrine</b> added to reduce circulatory and respiratory effects.|$|E
40|$|A GC/MS {{method for}} the {{simultaneous}} analyses of different amphetamines and <b>ephedrines</b> in urine employing analytical-grade acetic anhydride/pyridine as derivatizing reagents {{was developed and}} validated. Solid-phase extraction {{was performed on the}} samples, which were then derivatizated and analyzed by GC/MS. The method showed a broad linear dynamic range (25 - 1000 ng mL- 1 with R² > 0. 99), high sensitivity (LODs of 0. 0140 to 15. 33 ng mL- 1 and LOQs of 0. 0466 to 51. 10 ng mL- 1), good precision (CV < 6 % for intra- and inter-assays), and excellent extraction recovery (87 to 96 %) for all the compounds studied. After validation, the method was applied in the analyses of real samples of human urine which were previously determined to contain at least one of such drugs. In all the samples, the amphetamines and <b>ephedrines</b> were promptly quantified, showing that the association of acetic anhydride and pyridine can be conveniently employed as a derivatizing agent...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{prevalence}} of legal and illegal stimulants in relation to doping-control analysis. Stimulants are among the oldest classes of doping agents, having been used since ancient times. Despite {{the ease with which}} they can be detected and the availability of sensitive detection methods, stimulants are still popular among athletes. Indeed, they remain one of the top three most popular classes of prohibited substances. Because the list of legal and illegal stimulants is extensive only a selection is discussed in detail. The compounds selected are caffeine, <b>ephedrines,</b> amphetamine and related compounds, methylphenidate, cocaine, strychnine, modafinil, adrafinil, 4 -methyl- 2 -hexaneamine, and sibutramine. These compounds are mainly prevalent in sport or are of therapeutic importance. Because stimulants are the oldest doping class the first detection methods were for this group. Several early detection techniques including GC-NPD, GC-ECD, and TLC are highlighted. The more novel detection techniques GC-MS and LC-MS are also discussed in detail. In particular, the last technique has been shown to enable successful detection of stimulants difficult to detect by GC-MS or for stimulants previously undetectable. Because stimulants are also regularly detected in nutritional (food) supplements a section on this topic is also included...|$|R
40|$|Inversion of {{configuration}} at the benzylic {{hydroxyl group}} of (1 S, 2 S) -pseudoephedrine (2) to afford (1 R, 2 S) -ephedrine {{is known to}} be a difficult process. The Mitsunobu reactions of 1 and 2 might offer a route to achieve such inversions. In fact Mitsunobu reactions on 1 and 2 are known to proceed via aziridines formed on intramolecular S(N) 2 substitution by the amine functionality. The Mitsunobu reactions of N-methylated and N-benzylated <b>ephedrines</b> have been found to proceed via the corresponding aziridinium ions. These aziridinium ions can be opened (S(N) 2 substitution) by nucleophiles like phthalimide and thiols. Intramolecular participation in 2 can be avoided by use of the tert-butyloxycarbonyl- (BOC) or benzyloxycarbonyl- (CBZ) protected derivatives. Mitsunobu reactions on these derivatives lead to inversion of configuration at the benzylic hydroxyl center. In contrast the BOC and CBZ derivatives of 1 are deprotected under Mitsunobu conditions. The Mitsunobu reactions of three (1 S, 2 S) - 2 -amino- 1, 3 -propanediol have also been examined. An attempt to achieve protection by reaction with dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal led to the more substituted 2 -oxazoline as established by X-ray crystallography. The desired inversion of configuration of the benzylic hydroxylic group was eventually achieved by protection of the amino substituent as the phthalimide and protection of the primary hydroxyl group as the tosylate...|$|R

40|$|In {{the latest}} years, many new psychoactive {{substances}} (NPS) from several drug classes {{have appeared in}} the illicit drug market. Their rapid, sensitive and specific identification in biological fluids is hence of great concern for clinical and forensic toxicologists. Here is described a multi-analyte method for the determination of NPS, pertaining to different chemical classes (synthetic cannabinoids, synthetic cathinones, ketamine, piperazines and amphetamine-type substances-ATS) in human hair using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) in electrospray ionization mode. We focused on a sample preparation able to extract the different classes of NPS. About 30 mg of hair was decontaminated and incubated overnight under sonication in different conditions {{depending on the type of}} analytes to be extracted: (a) with 300 μL of HCOOH 0. 1 % for cathinones, piperazines and ATS; (b) with 300 μL of MeOH for synthetic cannabinoids. Ten microliter of the extracts were then injected in UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS in MRM mode. The LODs varied from 2 pg/mg to 20 pg/mg. The method was linear in the range from the LOQ to 500 pg/mg and showed acceptable precision (%RSD< 15) and accuracy (%E< 15) for all the analytes. The method was finally applied on 50 samples from real forensic cases (driving license re-granting, postmortem toxicological analyses, workplace drug testing).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the prevalence of illicit drugs use among young adults, in particular elite athletes. This study considers the data obtained from anti-doping analyses performed on nearly 100, 000 urine samples from 2000 to 2009 by the World Anti-Doping Agency accredited Italian Anti-Doping Laboratory. The percentage of adverse analytical findings varies on a yearly basis, but it is in the range 1. 0 - 1. 8 % (not considering atypical findings, such as an altered endogenous steroid profile). Among positive results, there is a high prevalence of stimulants and drugs of abuse. The drug of abuse found most frequently is the tetrahydrocannabinol (cannabis) metabolite, accounting for 0. 2 - 0. 4 % of the total samples analysed (18 % of the positive results). The second most frequently encountered drug is cocaine, as detected from cocaine metabolites, accounting for 0. 1 % of the total samples analysed (7 % of positive results). Other stimulants found included amphetamines, <b>ephedrines,</b> carphedon, modafinil, and anorexic compounds. No amphetamine-like designer drugs were detected. These data are indicative of the widespread prevalence of cocaine and cannabis use among the young adult population. However, due to the particular population studied, it must be considered an underestimation of the phenomenon among elite athletes with respect to the general population. © 2011 Taylor & Francis...|$|R
40|$|A new {{analytical}} approach, {{based on}} derivatization with 2, 2, 2 -trichloroethyl chloroformate and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), was investigated for {{qualitative and quantitative}} analyses of a large range of amphetamine-related drugs and <b>ephedrines</b> in plasma, urine and hair samples. Sample preparation involved alkaline extraction of analytes from biological samples using Extrelut columns, after addition of the internal standard 3, 4 -methylenedioxypropylamphetamine (MDPA), and subsequent derivatization to produce 2, 2, 2 -trichloroethylcarbamates. GC/MS analyses, in splitless mode using a slightly polar 30 -m capillary column, were performed with quadrupole or ion trap instruments. MS acquisition modes were electron ionization (EI) in full-scan or selected ion monitoring (SIM) modes (quadrupole), and full-scan MS or MS/MS modes with chemical ionization (CI) conditions (ion trap). EI spectra of 2, 2, 2 -trichloroethylcarbamates showed variably abundant molecular ions as well as abundant diagnostic fragment ions, both characterized by ion clusters reflecting the isotope distribution of three chlorine atoms in the derivatized molecules. CI spectra showed abundant protonated molecules. Quantitative studies using EI SIM conditions gave recoveries in the range 74 - 89 %, linear response over ranges of 10 - 2000 ng/mL (plasma and urine) and 0. 20 - 20 ng/mg (hair), with corresponding limits of detection in the ranges 2 - 5 ng/mL and 0. 1 - 0. 2 ng/mg.

40|$|A liquid chromatography–high {{resolution}} {{mass spectrometry}} (LC-HRMS) method for the simultaneous screening in hair samples of drugs {{of abuse and}} medicaments was developed. Target analytes screened using a single extraction and analytical run were opiates, cocaine, amphetamines and amphetamine-like substances, ketamine and analogues, cannabinoids, both natural and synthetic, cathinones, piperazines, <b>ephedrines</b> and others new psychoactive substances not pertaining to these classes; pharmaceutical drugs such as antipsychotics, antiepileptics, antidepressants, benzodiazepines and analogues, anorectics, stimulants, drugs for the erectile dysfunction. The multiresidual method involved methanolic incubation of 30  mg of decontaminated hair {{and analysis of the}} extract in HPLC using a C 18 column. The mass detector, a benchtop Orbitrap Exactive, with nominal resolving power of 100, 000, operated in full scan mode in positive ESI. Analytes were identified by exact mass, correspondence of isotopic cluster and retention times using a home-made database. The database contained the protonated exact masses of each monoisotopic compound, the retention time and the molecular formula of each studied analyte. At the moment the database contains 177 analytes. The screening method was validated for selectivity, limit of detection (LOD), matrix effect and carryover. The limits of detection obtained varied from 2 to 30  pg/mg, and the matrix effect was negligible. This method was then applied to three hundred authentic samples, resulting in the identification of various drugs of abuse and therapeutic drugs. The analyte identity was subsequently confirmed by in-source fragmentation.

40|$|Until {{the end of}} 2003 a urinary {{concentration}} of pseudoephedrine exceeding 25 microg/mL {{was regarded as a}} doping violation by the World Anti-Doping Agency. Since its removal from the prohibited list in 2004 the number of urine samples in which pseudoephedrine was detected in our laboratory increased substantially. Analysis of 116 in-competition samples containing pseudoephedrine in 2007 and 2008, revealed that 66 % of these samples had a {{concentration of}} pseudoephedrine above 25 microg/mL. This corresponded to 1. 4 % of all tested in competition samples in that period. In the period 2001 - 2003 only 0. 18 % of all analysed in competition samples contained more than 25 microg/mL. Statistical comparison of the two periods showed that after the removal of pseudoephedrine from the list its use increased significantly. Of the individual sports compared between the two periods, only cycling is shown to yield a significant increase. Analysis of excretion urine samples after administration of a therapeutic daily dose (240 mg pseudoephedrine) in one administration showed that the threshold of 25 microg/mL can be exceeded. The same samples were also analysed for cathine, which has currently a threshold of 5 microg/mL on the prohibited list. The maximum urinary concentration of cathine also exceeded the threshold for some volunteers. Comparison of the measured cathine and pseudoephedrine concentrations only indicated a poor correlation between them. Hence, cathine is not a good indicator to control pseudopehedrine intake.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} utilized electrospray ion mobility {{mass spectrometry}} (ESI-IMS-MS) to develop methods {{necessary for the}} separation of chiral compounds of forensic interest. The compounds separated included <b>ephedrines</b> and pseudoephedrines, that occur as impurities in confiscated amphetamine type substances (ATS) {{in an effort to}} determine the origin of these substances. The ESI-IMS-MS technique proved to be faster and more cost effective than traditional chromatographic methods currently used to conduct chiral separations such as gas and liquid chromatography. Both mass spectrometric and computational analysis revealed the separation mechanism of these chiral interactions allowing for further development to separate other chiral compounds by IMS. Successful separation of chiral compounds was achieved utilizing a variety of modifiers injected into the IMS drift tube. It was found that the modifiers themselves {{did not need to be}} chiral in nature and that achiral modifiers were sufficient in performing the required separations. The ESI-IMS-MS technique was also used to detect thermally labile compounds which are commonly found in explosive substances. The methods developed provided mass spectrometric identification of the type of ionic species being detected from explosive analytes as well as the appropriate solvent that enhances detection of these analytes in either the negative or positive ion mode. An application of the developed technique was applied to the analysis of a variety of low explosive smokeless powder samples. It was found that the developed ESI-IMS-MS technique not only detected the components of the smokeless powders, but also provided data that allowed the classification of the analyzed smokeless powders by manufacturer or make. ...|$|R
