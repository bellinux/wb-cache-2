60|$|Folks {{suffering}} from Jingoism, Spreadeagleism, Chauvinism--all such like isms, to whatever country they belong--would be {{well advised to}} take a tour in Holland. It is the idea of the moment that size spells happiness. The bigger the country the better one is for living there. The happiest Frenchman cannot possibly be as happy as the most wretched Britisher, for the reason that Britain owns many more thousands of square miles than France possesses. The Swiss peasant, compared with the Russian serf, must, when he looks at the map of Europe and Asia, feel himself to be a miserable creature. The reason that <b>everybody</b> <b>in</b> <b>America</b> is happy and good is to be {{explained by the fact that}} America has an area equal to that of the entire moon. The American citizen who has backed the wrong horse, missed his train and lost his bag, remembers this and feels bucked up again.|$|E

[...] Most people have seen hundreds; and, as for myself, I believe I should be safe in saying I had, even at that day, seen a thousand. In this {{particular}} instance, there were great felicitations among the yeomen, because the frame [...] "had come together well." [...] I was congratulated on this score, the hearty old Rhode Islander, my brother major, assuring me that [...] "he couldn't get the blade of his knife, and it's no great matter of a knife either, into a single j'int. And, what is more, 'squire"--as the sturdy yeoman was a major himself, though only in the militia, that title {{would not have been}} honorable enough for his landlord--"and, what is more, 'squire, they tell me not a piece was ever tried, until we put the bents together, this a'ternoon, ourselves! Now, down country, I never see'd sich a thing; but, up here, the carpenters go by what they call the 'square-rule;' and quick work they make on't!" [...] This speech contained the substance of one of the contrivances by which the [...] "new countries" [...] were endeavoring {{to catch up with the}} [...] "old," [...] as I learned on further inquiries.|$|E

It can refer to a battle; to a handing; to a coronation; to the killing of Jumbo by the railway-train; {{to the arrival of}} Jenny Lind at the Battery; to the meeting of the President and Prince Henry; to the chase of a murderous maniac; to the {{disaster}} in the tunnel; to the explosion in the subway; to a remarkable dog-fight; to a village church struck by lightning. It will be said, more or less causally, by <b>everybody</b> <b>in</b> <b>America</b> who has seen Prince Henry do anything, or try to. The man who was absent and didn't see him to anything, will scoff. It is his privilege; and he can make capital out of it, too; he will seem, even to himself, to be different from other Americans, and better. As his opinion of his superior Americanism grows, and swells, and concentrates and coagulates, he will go further and try to belittle the distinction of those that saw the Prince do things, and will spoil their pleasure in it if he can. My life has been embittered by that kind of person. If you are able to tell of a special distinction that has fallen to your lot, it gravels them; they cannot bear it; and they try to make believe that the thing you took for a special distinction was nothing of the kind and was meant in quite another way. Once I was received in private audience by an emperor. Last week I was telling a jealous person about it, and I could see him wince under it, see him bite, see him suffer. I revealed the whole episode to him with considerable elaboration and nice attention to detail. When I was through, he asked me what had impressed me most. I said: ...|$|E

6000|$|... “Oh there’s {{no doubt}} you’re awfully bad,” Mr. Longstraw broke out, with joyous eagerness. Naturally he couldn’t {{know that what}} she had principally in mind was an {{exchange}} of opinions {{that had taken place}} between her sister and herself just before she came to stay with Mrs. Lemon. This incident, of which he himself was the occasion, might indeed have been called a discussion, for it had carried them quite into the cold air of the abstract. Lady Barb had said she didn’t see how Agatha could look at such a creature as that—an odious familiar vulgar being who had not about him the rudiments of a gentleman. Lady Agatha had replied that Mr. Longstraw was familiar and rough and that he had a twang and thought it amusing to talk to her as “the Princess”; but that he was a gentleman for all that and was tremendous fun whatever one called him—it didn’t seem to matter what one called any one or anything there. Her sister had returned to this that if he was rough and familiar he couldn’t be a gentleman, inasmuch as that was just what a gentleman meant—a man who was civil and well-bred and well-born. Lady Agatha had argued that such a point was just where she differed; that a man might perfectly be a gentleman and yet be rough, and even ignorant, so long as he was really nice. The only thing was that he should be really nice, which was the case with Mr. Longstraw, who, moreover, was quite extraordinarily civil—as civil as a man could be. And then Lady Agatha herself made the strongest point she had ever made in her life (she had never been so inspired) in saying that Mr. Longstraw was rough perhaps, but not rude—a distinction altogether wasted on her sister, who declared that she hadn’t come to America, of all places, to learn what a gentleman was. The discussion in short had been a trifle grim. I know not whether it was the tonic effect on them too, alien organisms as they were, of the fine winter weather, or that of Lady Barb’s being bored and having nothing else to do; but Lord Canterville’s daughters went into the question with the moral earnestness of a pair of approved Bostonians. It was part of Lady Agatha’s view of her admirer that he after all much resembled other tall people with smiling eyes and tawny moustaches who had ridden a good deal in rough countries and whom she had seen in other places. If he was more familiar he was also more alert; still, the difference was not in himself, but in the way she saw him—the way she saw <b>everybody</b> <b>in</b> <b>America.</b> If she should see the others in the same way no doubt they’d be quite the same; and Lady Agatha sighed a little over the possibilities of life; for this peculiar way, especially regarded in connexion with gentlemen, had become very pleasant to her.|$|E

5000|$|The album's title, The Dutchess, is a {{derivation}} of {{the noble}} title [...] "The Duchess of York", as Fergie (a derivative {{of her last}} name [...] "Ferguson") and Sarah Ferguson, the real Duchess of York, share a surname and nickname. (The spelling [...] "Dutchess," [...] while nonstandard in contemporary English, was historically a more common spelling, as demonstrated in place names like Dutchess County, New York, itself named after a Duchess of York in 1683.) The album's title garnered media attention, with Sarah Ferguson commenting, [...] "Automatically, <b>everybody</b> <b>in</b> <b>America</b> thinks I'm Fergie, {{the most beautiful woman}} in the world, from Black Eyed Peas. ... You know, I rang her up about that. I said, 'Fergie, it's Fergie... Now that you've done this, you have to sing at a concert for my foundation Children in Crisis'." [...] Fergie then commented about its title, [...] "If you notice, on the album cover it says 'Fergie as the Dutchess' because I wanted each song to be a movie poster. But because 'London Bridge' did so well so fast, we had to get everything done so only half the songs on the album have movie poster themes. For example, for 'Fergalicious' I'm holding a lollipop; it's pretty campy and cute. The pictures were all shot by Ellen von Unwerth in Paris so a lot of them are very Brigitte Bardot-esque." ...|$|E
