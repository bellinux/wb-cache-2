25|$|The third book, which {{contains}} 290 verses, is by a much inferior hand. The writer calls himself Lygdamus {{and the love}} that he sings of Neaera. He has little poetical power, and his style is meagre and jejune. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> many reminiscences and imitations of Tibullus, Propertius and Ovid (iii. 5, 15-20, and Ovid, Ars. am. ii. 669 seq.; Tr. iv. 10, 6: and Am. xi. 14, 23 seq.); {{and they are not}} always happy. It is unknown when his poems were added to the genuine poems of Tibullus.|$|E
25|$|Master Sergeant Rico Velasquez is {{a veteran}} of the ISA. He is a human tank who prefers to shoot first and ask {{questions}} later, if at all. He is all attitude, but despite this, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> heart. Rico prefers an up-front fight and is a character of extremes; he gets agitated easily and does not refrain from taking action. During the orbital defense platform crisis, Rico was left stranded by a brutal Helghast attack and consequently befriended Templar, Luger, and Hakha. Later, he became embedded with Alpha Team to spearhead the invasion on Helghan’s capital, Pyrrhus.|$|E

25|$|Carving {{in relief}} is common enough, idols being {{produced}} in many forms. The South African carves {{the handle of}} his spoon perhaps {{in the form of}} a giraffe, and in the round, with each leg cut separately and the four hoofs meeting at the bowl, hardly a comfortable form of handle to hold. The North American Indian shows a wider invention than some nations, the twist in various shapes being a favorite treatment say of pipe stems. The Papuan has quite a style of his own; he uses a scroll of the form familiar in Indian shawls, and in some cases the scroll entwines in a way which faintly suggests the guilloche. The native of New Guinea also employs the scroll for a motive, the flat treatment of which reminds one of a similar method in use in Scandinavian countries. The work of the New Zealander is greatly in advance of the average primitive type; he uses a very good scheme of scroll work for decorative purposes, the lines of the scrolls often being enriched with a small pattern in a way reminding one of the familiar Norman treatment, as for example the prows of his canoes. The Maori wood carver sometimes carves not only the barge boards of his house but the gables also, reptilian and grotesque figures being as a rule introduced; the main posts and rafters, too, of the inside receive attention. Unlike the Hindu <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> idea of decorative proportion, and does not plan his scheme of design on too small a scale.|$|E
500|$|April 2013 saw Carrick {{nominated}} for the PFA Player of the Year Award for his performances during the season with Manchester United. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger said Carrick would be his personal choice for the award, [...] "He is a quality passer. He could play for Barcelona, he would be perfectly suited to their game. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> vision and is an intelligent player." [...] Tottenham winger Gareth Bale was ultimately voted as the winner; Carrick was, however, included in the PFA Team of the Year for the 2012–13 season. Carrick went on to be announced as Manchester United's Players' Player of the Year for the 2012–13 season.|$|E
500|$|The picture teases {{the viewer}} who {{is given the}} feeling that he is in a dark room being viewed by the main subject of the {{painting}} who is a man that peeks {{through a hole in the}} door. The narrative element of the image, which included a speech bubble that presents the caption [...] "I Can See the Whole Room and There's Nobody in It", clarifies that the man can not see anything in the room although <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> look at it. The work is a satirical reference to abstraction because it can be imagined as a monochrome canvas that is affected by an actor that has inserted his finger as well as a narrative that also violates this imagining. This finger is also regarded as phallic.|$|E

50|$|Spriggs was {{predicted}} to {{be a second}} round pick in the NFL Draft by NFL Scout Lance Zierlein.

500|$|Zach Gilford {{said about}} his {{character}} Matt Saracen that [...] "there are {{different parts of}} it from people I know growing up or people I'm tight with now". He credited Peter Berg with {{coming up with the}} Saracen character, and said he was grateful to [...] "have some of the most realistic and heartfelt storylines." [...] When asked which of the actors would have been drafted highest by the NFL, he replied [...] "Probably Taylor [...] He's a good athlete, but Scott will kill me for saying that. Scott played football growing up and <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> arm, but Taylor is faster and I think that would help his draft status." [...] Gaius Charles, who plays [...] "Smash" [...] Williams, graduated from the Carnegie Mellon School of Drama in 2005, determined to find a job within a year, which he did with Friday Night Lights. He describes himself as [...] "all right" [...] at football, but says that he was taken aback by the intensity of the plays on the set.|$|E
500|$|When the {{character}} was announced, he {{was described as}} a hustler who sees everything as an opportunity, and has created several personas since the age of seven to hide his real self. Norwood expanded on this, saying [...] "when he was in school and the register was being read out and it got to his name it would be 'Chubb!' and all the kids in school would start taking the mickey out of it. What he did was create something even more ridiculous to take away from that. He [...] out of himself and took the power away from those that were taking the mickey out of him. [...] For the same reason most kids put on a front, it's to protect himself from the world. He doesn't like his real name so he tried to create something that would get away from that and Fatboy was that creation. The street and the slang stuff is not something that is far away from him, it is still from the area that he lives in. Fatboy was someone he adopted to put a brave face on, to put a mask on himself, to protect Arthur from the world." [...] Before adopting the [...] "Fatboy" [...] persona, he would adopt personas of men he saw on television, and Norwood said Fatboy was [...] "an awkward kind of child". Fatboy comes from a wealthy background, and gets what he wants from his parents, with whom <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> relationship, but hustles to hide the fact. He often wears clothing brand Ed Hardy, and his speech has, according to Norwood, a [...] "unique rhythm". Norwood is able to make viable changes to the script to make it sound more authentic.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} his {{character}} by the Washington Post, Violette said that [...] "He's {{a guy who has}} a lot of dreams and hopes. But he's not able to make them concrete because I think he's a little bit lazy. He's {{the kind of guy who}} always has bad luck [...] [...] [...] but I'm sure <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> heart." ...|$|E

2500|$|Steve Oram {{appears as}} Daniel, Sara's assistant. When asked {{what made him}} want to get {{involved}} in the project, Oram revealed that he had loved the script from the moment he read it and really liked his character. Oram called Daniel [...] "slightly misguided and psychopathic", but <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> heart. Sara's other friends, Jamie and Justine, are portrayed by Dominic Coleman and Nicola Walker. Coleman auditioned for the role of Jamie, but was unsure if he would get the part as he did not have much in common with the character.|$|E

2500|$|The {{character}} {{was created by}} Dominic Treadwell-Collins, {{who came up with}} the idea of the Carter family before he became the executive producer of EastEnders. The {{character was}} influenced by Treadwell-Collins' own father. Dyer was asked to play Mick and he accepted because the role was not typical of other roles he has played, and he was happy that Mick's partner would be played by Bright. Mick is described as a family man who is patriotic and kind, and it was said that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> partnership with Linda but they fight [...] "like teenagers".|$|E
2500|$|In 1901, Sexton {{agreed to}} take time away from his medical {{practice}} to coach the Michigan baseball team. [...] An article in Ann Arbor's The Weekly Bulletin in April 1902 noted the Wolverines' good fortune in securing Sexton's services:"He located near Boston, where <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> practice now. [...] His love for baseball, however, prompted him {{to respond to the}} urgent demands of the Michigan management for his services as coach last year, as well as for this year.

2500|$|Larry Drake as Robert G. Durant, a ruthless, sadistic mob {{boss and}} the head of his own {{criminal}} organization. He auditioned for the film and Raimi liked the way he underplayed the character, [...] "quiet and careful, yet intense," [...] the actor remembers. The director had never seen L.A. Law but found that Drake's face reminded him of [...] "a modern day Edward G. Robinson. He looked so mean, so domineering, yet he had this urban wit about him. I thought, 'My God, this guy is not only threatening-looking, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> physical presence – what a perfect adversary for the Darkman!'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Neil Flynn {{portrays the}} [...] "Janitor" [...] (guest star seasons 1 and 9, main cast seasons 2–8), the hospital's custodian. An {{incident}} in the pilot episode establishes an antagonistic relationship between [...] J.D. and him, which persists throughout the series. This tends to {{take the form of}} the Janitor pulling abusive pranks on J.D., although he has shown, several times throughout the series, that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> side. The Janitor's real name is not mentioned until the season eight finale when he reveals to J.D. that he is called [...] "Glenn Matthews". Shortly after this revelation, he is addressed as and answers to [...] "Tommy" [...] by another member of the hospital staff, bringing his previously stated name into question. However, it was later confirmed in a Facebook video by creator Bill Lawrence that the former is indeed his true name.|$|E
2500|$|Jon Nelson {{also has}} criticized Morey for {{incorrect}} quotes. Nelson {{notes that in}} Morey's The New Atheism (1986) he quoted Nicholas Capaldi's book The Art of Deception {{as an example of}} atheist deception, but the [...] "problem is that Capaldi never says this (or anything like it) on this or on any other page. Morey has numerous other false quotes attributed to Capaldi, such as: 'Refuse to be convinced. Even if you feel that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> argument and that your case is weaker, refuse to be convinced of your opponent's case'. Nowhere does Capaldi advocate, as Morey accuses him of doing, that atheists should 'use any invalid or deceptive argument as long as it helps him (to) win his case.'" [...] Nelson goes on to say that, [...] "However, Morey has an 'out'. There are no actual quotation marks on these alleged quotes." ...|$|E
2500|$|He was {{selected}} for the second West Indies touring side that toured England in 1906. In 12 first class matches he scored 223 {{at an average of}} 11.73 and took 24 wickets at an average of 29.95. Before the 1906 tour he was described as a [...] "one of the best professional bowlers in the West Indies (fast over-arm). Is a native of Barbados" [...] and [...] "a professional who may be looked on as the mainstay of the attack. He bowls fast right arm, with an off break, the balls rising very sharply with the pitch. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> defence and is a safe field". He {{turned out to be a}} disappointment on the tour, his wickets being very expensive. He did score a rapid 59* in 65 minutes against the M.C.C. but never took 5 wickets in an innings. In truth he was well passed his best by this time.|$|E
