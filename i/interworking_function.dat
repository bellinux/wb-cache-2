40|$|The {{traditional}} circuit-switched {{telecommunication network}} and the packet-switched data network are converging to a single packet-switched network. One important appli-cation of the converged network is telephony communications, {{also referred to as}} VoIP (Voice over IP). Call signaling protocols, such as H. 323, SIP and MGCP, have been de-veloped to support VoIP communications. To enable devices using different VoIP pro-tocols to communicate, gateways are needed to translate messages of one protocol to messages of another. In this paper, we present a simple, flexible framework for this in-terworking function. The framework is based on a half-call model where a call is con-trolled by two half-call finite state machines (FSMs), one representing the state of the caller and the other representing the state of the callee. The <b>interworking</b> <b>function</b> has been implemented such that the caller FSM of one VoIP protocol can interact with the callee FSM of any VoIP protocol. The development effort of the <b>interworking</b> <b>function</b> is minimized since only two half-call FSMs for each VoIP protocol are needed and they can be developed independently as long as the design conforms to the same interface specification. We have developed an integrated call agent (ICA) that contains the half-call FSMs of H. 323, SIP and MGCP.

Widespread {{adoption}} {{of the next generation}} concepts in telecommunications has substantially affected the overall system architecture as well as each network element in particular. The softswitch is a heterogeneous control, service and management element. It is composed of several different logical functionalities that are vital to system operation of any kind and whose migration strategy has not yet been clearly defined. We present a general strategy of softswitch remodelling to meet IMS requirements and characteristics that might be interesting for different softswitch providers with respective architectural options in fixed or wireless domains. In the proposed solution, the initial softswitch architecture is presented in an independent and generalized way. Additional feature enhancements provide virtual parallel protocol environments inside a softswitch, each enabling specific advantages common to its features. The SIP segment is separated and introduced as an independent subsystem. Further architectural modularity assures a level of independency between parallel protocol environments and future openness with regard to IMS requirements. As a result, the IMS softswitch encompasses basic SIP/IMS functionalities while some of the existent compounds take over different roles of element <b>interworking</b> <b>functions</b> and partially functionalities of standalone IMS entities.

It describes an architecture {{on top of an}} IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) for implementing an Instant Messaging (IM) service based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) that allows an easy and straightforward integration of various heterogeneous messaging protocols to deliver continuity of service with legacy networks. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) introduced "SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions" (SIMPLE) as a protocol suite that constitutes an open and interoperable standard for instant messaging and presence. Relying on this set of specifications, the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) has developed an application enabler (SIMPLE IM) that defines a complete architecture and framework in order to enable interactive communication capabilities over an IP-based infrastructure. OMA Converged IP Messaging (CPM) specifies the successor enabler which provides a transparent and seamless approach of interworking between disparate messaging services in the Telecommunications and Internet domain while leveraging standardized functionalities from existing enablers. The drafted framework of CPM has been the fundamental design pattern for the system layout realized within this work. For this thesis developed, the converged messaging architecture extends the previous mentioned SIMPLE IM enabler with several components. <b>Interworking</b> <b>Functions</b> (IWFs) represent the protocol adaption logic between SIP and the specific messaging protocol whereas an <b>Interworking</b> Selection <b>Function</b> (ISF) is responsible for delivering the messages towards the appropriate IWF. In addition, an Application Control Function (ACF) will be introduced which exposes the messaging features to external functional components like Value-Added Service (VAS) applications. Furthermore, this thesis outlines the integration into a NGN infrastructure and the benefits and open issues arising from this concept. A broad overview of the specification and standardization landscape is given as well as the interconnection between existing and ongoing standards that are relevant for this research topic. In addition to basic considerations it is intended to also deal with the practical prerequisites which inform the system design.

40|$|Abstract The current Internet {{infrastructure}} must be architected {{to handle}} future media-rich, and content rich applications. The success of {{applications such as}} video-on-demand, multicast and content distribution depends on Quality of Service and bandwidth guarantees. Over the years, the Internet has encompassed many changes in traffic profiles and applications, in bandwidths and utilization, but the future Internet infrastructure necessitates a very different architecture supporting Quality of Service (QoS). A satellite, distinguished by features such as global coverage, bandwidth flexibility, broadcast, multicast, and reliability, is an excellent candidate to provide broadband integrated Internet access. The aim of this thesis is to explore suitability of satellite technologies for broadband Internet services with significant emphasis {{on the question of}} defining, assessing, and developing QoS models for satellite ATM and IP broadband networks with and without onboard processing. For the satellite Internet, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) performance is degraded due to long propagation delays, link errors, and bandwidth asymmetry. In this thesis, for satellite ATM, fundamental questions such as buffer requirements, TCP/ATM efficiency, fairness, and multiple access are addressed through extensive simulations in a quantitative way. Buffer designs for TCP over satellite ATM Unspecified Bit Rate (UBR) service are performed. A buffer size equal to half the round trip delay-bandwidth product of the TCP connections provides high efficiency for TCP over satellite UBR. An extensive TCP analysis via simulation study for various TCP mechanisms and end system policies show that for satellite environment end system policies are more important than switch drop policies in terms of efficiency and fairness for World Wide Web traffic. A bandwidth allocation scheme is proposed and analytical model for supporting voice and video service over a broadband satellite network is developed. The study results demonstrate that non-contiguous allocation can afford higher gain in uplink utilizations. In this thesis, for the first time, Integrated Services and Differentiated Services based QoS architectures for broadband satellite IP networks are proposed and analyzed. In multimedia applications where User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is used along with TCP, a fair excess bandwidth allocation is not possible because TCP is congestion sensitive whereas UDP is congestion insensitive. An extensive simulation model is developed to study the effect of precedence levels for reserved rate utilization and fairness with different buffer management policies. The simulation results indicate that three levels of precedence are required for better utilization. Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) over Satellite network has been proposed and a simulation model developed to study the throughput performance impacts for TCP and UDP. The traffic engineering of MPLS facilitates efficient and reliable network design to optimize the utilization of network resources and enhance the network QoS. A novel Code Division Multiple Access based Spread ALOHA single code multiple access scheme for broadband satellite return channel is proposed as an alternative to Multifrequency-Time Division Multiple Access based Digital Video Broadcasting-Return Channel via Satellite protocol. It is shown through Monte Carlo simulations that throughput for Spread ALOHA One Long Code equivalent to packet length, is better than Spread ALOHA One Code in which spreading sequence repeats every symbol. The reduction of throughput due to multi-user interference for different number of users is shown.

ToIP is different from Voice over IP, because it is intended as a Carrier-class service, fully featured and with quality of service guarantees, to be offered to {{a large number of}} users, either overlapping or substituting classical Plain Old Telephone Services. CSELT is performing both theoretical and experimental analysis; in particular we are focusing our work on the mechanisms and protocols developed in the standardisation bodies in order to verify how the telephony services can be supported by means of an IP network. In the first half of 2000 we have performed a laboratory trial in order to demonstrate the "proof-of-concept" of ToIP capabilities, performance and interoperability with TDM-based switching technology. In the solution tested in CSELT, provided by a leading manufacturer, the IP technology is deployed in the transit network, so it is necessary to have an <b>interworking</b> <b>function</b> between a traditional circuit network and the IP network.
