40|$|Lakoff in her theory {{states that}} women use {{language}} which reinforce their subordinate status: they are colluding {{in their own}} subordination {{by the way they}} speak and by the way the language are spoken. Therefore, Lakoff proceeds to draw up 10 women's linguistic characteristics, as distinct from male's language, Furthermore, Lakoff suggests that it does not mean male does not produce any of women linguistic features but men produce very little average of 10 female's features comparing than women. Based on that statement, this thesis was then written to find out whether she-males who are naturally a man, employ women's language. As the objects of her study, the writer uses two 'shemales'; one is called Markona and the other is Dendong. Both of them lead the program of WAK MAR, which is broadcasted in El-Victor FM every day, except on Wednesday, at 9 p. m. to 12 p. m. There is only one day program chosen by the writer to be analyzed. The analysis is based on the theory of Lakoff (1973) about 10 women's linguistic features. After analyzing the data, the writer found out that Markona and Dendong employ almost all women's linguistic features. However, they are considered not to adopt female's language since the number for each woman's characteristic occured is very few contrasted with the number of their utterances. Moreover, women's feature that is occured the most often is emphatic stress, then the second most women's feature occured is pause fillers, and the third is tag question. Two women's features, superpolite forms and hypercorrect grammar did not occur at all. From the findings, the writer concluded that she-males who are naturally a male, employ women's language but they do not adopt it. She-males are not able to adopt female's language completely because in having their new identity as 'women', they only imitate the basic performance of female, <b>high</b> <b>intonation.</b> This <b>high</b> <b>intonation</b> is performaed through the lots of use of emphatic stress...|$|E

40|$|It is {{commonly}} agreed {{that one of}} the major goals in the devel-opment of modern text-to-speech synthesis is the improvement of prosody, especially <b>intonation.</b> Although <b>high</b> quality <b>intonation</b> is an important factor on the way to more natural synthetic speech, it is seldom scrutinized empirically whether and how this affects the relative performance of other components, such as segmental synthesis. The present paper discusses two preliminary rating ex-periments inquiring into the relation between the naturalness of intonation and subjective segmental quality in Finnish. Experi-ment 1 showed that the perception of intonation is dependent on the segmental quality. More crucially, Experiment 2 indicated that also the perceived segmental acceptability is significantly depen-dent on the relative naturalness of intonation. In light of the present observations, the goal of improved intonation is not only desirable for the overall quality’s sake alone, but it is also shown to improve even the subjective perception of a very basic feature of synthetic speech such as segmental acceptability. 1...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. In {{auditory}} health persuasion, the speaker’s speech becomes salient, {{as there}} is no visual information available. Intonation of speech is one important aspect that may influence persuasion. It was experimentally tested to what extent different levels of intonation are related to persuasion. Furthermore, self-affirmation is applied to investigate whether for some recipients the threat posed by the information in the message might become too strong to face. The topic of the health message referred to the intake of sufficient fruit and vegetables. Methods. In Study 1 (N = 130), students either listened to a health message with a low, moderate or high level of intonation. In Study 2 (N = 143), the same manipulations of intonation were applied but half of the participants were affirmed before they listened to the persuasive message. To analyze the effects, ANCOVA is used with intention to start consuming more fruit and vegetables as dependent variable. Results. Study 1 showed that among participants who perceived their own health as poor, the <b>high</b> <b>intonation</b> led to a significant drop in persuasion. In Study 2 this effect was replicated and, in addition, the drop in intention was prevented by the self-affirmation procedure. Conclusions. A high level of intonation seems to induce a strong self-threat in those for whom the information is personally relevant. To cope with this threat, a defensive reaction is mobilized.

This is a speech act research that employs a descriptive qualitative method. The source of data is a film entitled “Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. ” By using a purposive sampling technique, the researcher finds 36 data of commissive expressions in the film transcript. After the data have been collected, they are analyzed based on the domain of the dialogue and the researcher uses SPEAKING formula as the guiding theory. Each datum is analyzed further to know the contexts of the situations of the dialogues where the commissive expressions occur. The findings of the research are as follows: first, the researcher finds six forms of commissive expressions in the dialogues of the film “Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,” they are promise, refuse, agree, offer, oppose, and threat; second, all the characters employ commissive expressions both in formal and informal situations and the domains found are school domain, friendship domain, family domain, public place domain, and graveyard domain. The characters use <b>high</b> <b>intonation</b> if their relationships are less intimate and they use usual or low intonation if their relationships are intimate.

These results are interpreted as evidence that just the intonation and pauses of a conversation already contain sufficient information to project end-of-utterance TRPs. However this information is measurably impoverished with respect to full speech to an extent that increases the “processing ” time by 10 %.

40|$|If a {{conversation}} is held, turn taking must take place {{which means that}} there must be changes of the speaker?s turn during the conversation. Strenstrom theory (1994) divides turn taking strategies into taking the turn strategy, holding the turn strategy and yielding the turn strategy. Sometimes, there is a dominant speaker who talks longer than others. However, gender {{can be one of the}} some aspects that can influence someone to be a dominant speaker. Tannen said that men are more dominant than women in the conversation. Recently, there is an issue which states that actually women are more dominant than men in the conversation. Next, the writer chooses the film Pretty Woman as the sources of this research because the story is very popular and also turn taking is found in the conversation. Therefore, the writer wants to know the dominant speaker between the main characters based on gender, especially in using the turn taking strategies. In this research, the writer uses both qualitative and quantitative research because the result of the quantitative research can support the final result of this research. The source of this research is only the main conversation between the main characters. After analyzing the data by using the Strenstrom?s theory, the writer finds out that taking the turn is the highest strategy that occurs between the main characters in Pretty Woman. Another finding is the dominant speaker between the main characters is a female. Moreover, some characteristics of using the turn taking strategies that are used by a dominant speaker in dominating other speakers in this research are using taking the turn strategy, especially uptake, a clean start, alert. In using those strategies, she usually gives respond and then starts a new topic again with questioning the previous speaker. Sometimes, the dominant speaker here gives her respond by using <b>high</b> <b>intonation,</b> so she tends to interrupt the male speaker who is still talking. Besides, the dominant speaker also uses holding the turn, especially new start. From the findings, the writer can conclude that the Tannen?s theory cannot be applied in this researc...|$|E

The object of the research is ethnography of communication of Marqus Flavious Aquilla as major character in The Eagle Movie (2011). The data of this research are utterances or dialogues which exist of settings, participants, ends, acts, keys, instruments, and genres by Marqus Flavious Aquilla in The Eagle Movie. The data source is taken from The Eagle movie by Kevin Macdonald. The method of collecting data employed by writer is analyzing document and conducting observation toward the movie. The {{method of data collection}} employed by writer is analysing document and conducting observation toward the movie. The writer does the following steps; watching the movie repeatedly, for understanding the movie deeply, collect the data of Marqus dialogues, noting the data on notebook, classifying the data based on the criteria. In analyzing the data, the writer uses Dell Hymes speaking theory for analyzing the ethnographic of communication of Marqus Flavious Aquilla. It means that the writer analyzes them as referred to the sociolinguistic context as follows: collecting the data from the Eagle movie, determining the Marqus dialogue based on the Dell Hymes theory, analyzing the ethnographic of communication of Marqus dialogues, drawing conclusion and proposing suggestion toward the data. The writer conducts research Ethnography of Communication of Marqus Flavious Aquilla, The Major Character in The Eagle movie (2011) which uses SPEAKING grid by Hymes for analyzing. SPEAKING grid of ethnography of communication is Settings or Scene, Participants, Ends, Keys, Instruments, Genre. The writer doesn‟t involve the term „norm‟ because particular reason which is discussed in previous chapter. The clear description of Ethnography of communication by Marqus is as follows, 1. This research findings ethnography of communication of Marqus is as follows: Setting of ethnography of communication by Marqus dialogues is at garrison, at uncle‟s home, at jungle, at government office. The scene of particular settings is firstly at garrison the scene of Marqus is surprised, secondly the scene is emotional toward the uncle‟s home setting. Thirdly x the scene at the jungle is a firm. The last is at government office, the scene is happy. 2. Participant of Marqus communication is the sender and receiver. The sender is as commander, as ex society member, as employer, and as friend while the receiver is as ex-commander, as employer, and as patient. 3. End of communication by Marqus is to command, to get honor, to get information, and to believe. 4. Act sequences of Marqus communication is commanding, getting the honor, getting information, believing. 5. Keys of Marqus communication consists of two aspect, those are tone and manner. The tone of Marqus utterances is flat, tense, worried, and intimidate, while manner of Marqus utterances is low intonation and <b>high</b> <b>intonation.</b> 6. Instruments of Marqus communication involves two aspect, those are verbal communication and non-verbal communication. The verbal communication consists of formal style and informal style, while the nonverbal communication is by lifting the thumb. 7. Genre of Marqus communication is command, and prayer. According to the research findings in chapter four, so the writer concludes briefly of the research. Marqus communication has been influenced by the society which is gaining the rumor, many more contribution of Roman society in growing Marqus intellectuality. The intellectuality relate to cognitive process who can affects somebody in delivering speech. Rome is civilized people who like to establish, expand land territory for colonialism. The people like to employ the savage, so it affects the paradigm of Marqus toward the tribe people outside of Rome. Marqus is tension and <b>high</b> <b>intonation</b> when he delivers speech. Temperamental and emotional person when talk to other is his character. Being commander who ambitiousness to find the honor back to his family with struggle not to let dishonor himselves in leading. The social class of Rome culture toward the savage also makes him elevates the prestige. Especially the great cause of family about the honor, they are government military legion from the grandfather so it flows military blood to Marqus which has higher position than generally society member. He sees that the common people must follow what he decides to. Hymes delivers SPEAKING (settings, participants, ends, act, keys, instruments, norms, and genre) aspect in analyzing communicative events. The writer eliminates an aspect from SPEAKING in analyzing the data. The writer removes “norms”. The reason is norms can‟t be analyzed from movie data.

Former {{research has shown that}} robot-mediated therapy is effective in the behavioral treatment of this disorder. However it has also been shown that not all robots are equally appropriate to be used for this purpose, due to patients’ limited processing capacities and selective attention patterns. The current study investigated whether intonation in a robot’s voice and humanization of its bodily appearance influence the outcomes of pivotal response treatment (PRT) sessions with children with HFA. The children (age range: 4 - 8) played a puzzle game with a robot, which required communication. Intonation (normal vs. monotonous) was varied on a within-subject basis, whereas appearance manipulation via human clothing was varied between subjects. Performance was assessed by two types of measurements: required prompting of communicative acts and spontaneous communicative initiatives towards the robot. Additionally, affective states received scoring derived from the individual assessment of demonstrated interest, happiness, and appropriate behavior. No effects on performance measurements were found. The influence of intonation on affective states was nonsignificant, although both general and dimension-specific affect scores tended to be higher in monotonous conditions. Appearance had a significant effect on general affect and interest scores, that were higher in ‘human appearance’ conditions. Finally, an interaction effect showed happiness scores to be significantly <b>higher</b> when <b>intonation</b> and appearance were either both machinelike (mechanical appearance, monotonous intonation) or both humanlike (humanlike appearance, normal intonation).

40|$|The {{choice of}} {{processing}} parameters for vocoded signals {{may have an}} important effect {{on the availability of}} various auditory features. Experiment 1 varied envelope cutoff frequency (30 and 300 Hz), carrier type (sine and noise), and number of bands (2 – 5) for vocoded speech presented to normal-hearing listeners. Performance was better with a high cutoff for sine-vocoding, with no effect of cutoff for noise-vocoding. With a low cutoff, performance was better for noise-vocoding than for sine-vocoding. With a high cutoff, performance was better for sine-vocoding. Experiment 2 measured perceptibility of cues to voice pitch variations. A noise carrier combined with a <b>high</b> cutoff allowed <b>intonation</b> to be perceived to some degree but performance was best in high-cutoff sine conditions. A low cutoff led to poorest performance, regardless of carrier. Experiment 3 tested the relative contributions of comodulation across bands and spectral density to improved performance with a sine carrier and high cutoff. Comodulation across bands had no effect so it appears that sidebands providing a denser spectrum improved performance. These results indicate that carrier type in combination with envelope cutoff can alter the available cues in vocoded speech, factors which must be considered in interpreting results with vocoded signals...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether deep-cryogenic freezing produces a change in the timbre or playing characteristics of brass trumpets. The experimental procedure consisted of two parts: quantitative analysis and qualitative analysis. For qualitative analysis a panel of four professional trumpet players evaluated five trumpets: four were frozen and re-evaluated, and one served as the experimental control. Analysis of the harmonic spectra of tones from each instrument provided quantitative data. Since previous studies requiring the analysis of musical instrument tones have suffered from a high degree of variation among tones played by human performers, I constructed a mechanical device that could play tones on the test instruments with greater consistency than is possible with live performers. The changes observed in the qualitative and quantitative analyses are very small, and possibly contradictory. The test panel rated all of the instruments higher after they had been frozen, and any actual improvement in the playing characteristics is suspect because the control instrument received the second highest improvement of the five instruments in the study. In the quantitative analysis, I observed some slight changes in the amplitudes of some of the harmonics in the spectral graphs, but I also observed slight variations in some of the harmonics of the control instrument. Inconsistencies in the performance of the electronic equipment used in the study could account for some of the variation. The instrument that showed the most statistically significant improvements was rated significantly <b>higher</b> in <b>intonation</b> after cryogenic processing, but I was unable to measure any frequency changes in the tones the mechanical embouchure played on the test instruments. Although one may not actually be able to measure differences reported in the qualitative analysis, it is not possible to rule out any acoustical change from cryogenic freezing. In fact, in the quantitative measurements, three of the instruments showed changes greater (some positive and some negative) than the "experimental error" seen in the control instrument's measurements. Additionally, one member of the test panel is convinced that cryogenic freezing has improved his instrument significantly, but the other three trumpeters are ambivalent. School of MusicThesis (D.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that maternal speech to normal hearing (NH) infants and speech to cochlear implant (CI) infants is characterized by similarly <b>high</b> pitch, increased <b>intonation</b> range and reduced rate of speech (Bergeson, Miller, 2 ̆ 6 McCune, 2006). These findings suggest that mothers demonstrate sensitivity to the infants’ hearing experience and tailor their speech to their infants’ auditory skill levels. Pause duration in infant-directed (ID) speech has also been shown to be influenced by age and hearing experience, but its relationship to language development is unknown. It has also been found that children with hearing loss tend to be exposed to more silence in a day, which in turn relates to lower language scores (Caskey 2 ̆ 6 Vohr, 2013). Although there is research on maternal speech to NH and hearing impaired infants, and there is much research on child language development, there is limited information pertaining to the correlation between the two. This thesis aimed to investigate conversational pause duration in mothers’ speech to CI infants as compared to NH infants matched on hearing age (HA), and how that is correlated with vocabulary acquisition. Longer pause duration could be correlated with lower vocabulary production, if consistent with the findings of Caskey and Vohr (2013). Sixteen mother-infant pairs (8 NH; 8 CI) participated in individual audio recorded play sessions. The time the mother allotted to her infant following her own utterance (i. e. mother-mother pause) and following infant utterances (i. e. infant-mother pause) was measured. Productive vocabulary was also recorded. Pause time between consecutive mother utterances and between a mother’s utterance and the infant’s response was measured and compared to expressive vocabulary as measured by the McArthur-Bates CDI. On average, mothers of CI infants and those of NH infants were comparable in the amount of time they allotted for their infants to respond. Mothers’ pause duration was not correlated with infants’ productive vocabulary. These results suggest that the length of time a mother pauses in conversation is not related to the child’s vocabulary development...|$|R
