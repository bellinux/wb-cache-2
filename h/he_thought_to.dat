5|$|Coffin did {{not enjoy}} being {{in the public eye}} and {{considered}} his job soliciting financial aid as begging for money, which <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be demeaning. He stated in his autobiography that he gladly gave up the position once a new leader for the organization was selected. Coffin became concerned about giving money freely to all blacks, some of whom he was believed {{would never be able to}} care for themselves unless adequate education and farms were provided. He also believed the Society should give their limited resources only to those who were best able to benefit from them. The Society continued to operate until 1870, the same year that black men were guaranteed the right to vote under the Fifteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Etty {{generally}} finished life studies {{during three}} evenings sittings. On the first evening he would sketch {{the model in}} charcoal or chalk, and then ink in the outline. On the second he used oil paints {{to fill in the}} figures. On the third he layered glaze and the final coverings of paint. He usually painted on millboard, re-using the reverse for fresh paintings. His female models were typically shop-girls, prostitutes, actresses or poses plastiques models, while his male models tended to be Life Guards recruited from the nearby barracks, who <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> have an appropriate muscular physique, or occasionally men Etty met in public bath houses.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, in 1980, {{geologist}} Walter Alvarez and his father, Nobel Prize-winning scientist Luis Walter Alvarez, put forth his hypothesis {{that a large}} extraterrestrial body had struck Earth. In 1981, unaware of Penfield's discovery, University of Arizona graduate student Alan R. Hildebrand and faculty adviser William V. Boynton published a draft Earth-impact theory and sought a candidate crater. Their evidence included greenish-brown clay with surplus iridium containing shocked quartz grains and small weathered glass beads that looked to be tektites. Thick, jumbled deposits of coarse rock fragments were also present, {{thought to have been}} scoured from one place and deposited elsewhere by a megatsunami resulting from an Earth impact. Such deposits occur in many locations but seem concentrated in the Caribbean basin at the K–Pg boundary. So when Haitian professor Florentine Morás discovered what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be evidence of an ancient volcano on Haiti, Hildebrand suggested it could be a telltale feature of a nearby impact. Tests on samples retrieved from the K–Pg boundary revealed more tektite glass, formed only in the heat of asteroid impacts and high-yield nuclear detonations.|$|E

5|$|In 1806, {{explorer}} David Thompson set {{out from}} Saskatchewan to find {{the source of the}} Columbia. He crossed over the Canadian Rockies through Howse Pass and eventually arrived {{on the banks of the}} Kootenay, which <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be the Columbia. Thompson traveled down the river a ways but turned back when he was attacked by Native Americans. The following year, Thompson, his family, and several men made another attempt at finding the Columbia. They crossed over the Rockies at a more northerly spot and traveled down the Blaeberry River to the Columbia, eventually discovering Columbia Lake and establishing there the trading post Kootenae House. In the spring of 1808, he set off down the Kootenay River, this time reaching present-day Montana and Idaho where he established Kullyspell House and Saleesh House, trading posts on Lake Pend Oreille and the Clark Fork, respectively. After spending a winter in Montana, he tried to reach the Columbia by traveling down the Pend Oreille River but failed in this attempt, eventually returning to Kootenae House via the Kootenay River northwards the following spring.|$|E

The state of Maryland also brought {{criminal}} charges against Garrison, quickly finding him guilty and ordering him to pay a fine of $50 and court costs. (Charges against Lundy were dropped {{on the grounds that}} he had been traveling when the story was printed.) Garrison refused to pay the fine and was sentenced to a jail term of six months. He was released after seven weeks when the anti-slavery philanthropist Arthur Tappan donated the money for the fine. Garrison decided to leave Baltimore, and he and Lundy amicably agreed to part ways.|$|E
25|$|Having {{lost his}} home world of Krypton, Superman is very {{protective}} of Earth, and especially of Clark Kent's family and friends. This same loss, {{combined with the}} pressure of using his powers responsibly, has caused Superman to feel lonely on Earth, despite having his friends and parents. Previous encounters with people <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be fellow Kryptonians, Power Girl (who is, in fact from the Krypton of the Earth-Two universe) and Mon-El, have led to disappointment. The arrival of Supergirl, who has been confirmed {{to be not only}} from Krypton, but also his cousin, has relieved this loneliness somewhat. Superman's Fortress of Solitude acts as a place of solace for him in times of loneliness and despair.|$|E
25|$|At other times, {{and unlike}} future viceroys, the Governor General's {{influence}} expanded more blatantly into government policy: Grey opposed the head tax {{imposed by the}} Chinese Immigration Act of 1885 on Chinese immigrants to Canada and, at one point, was invited to visit the province of British Columbia, but declined in protest of what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be exclusionary measures implemented by the provincial cabinet under premier Richard McBride. Grey also initially supported Asian immigration to Canada, though, following the Japanese victory in the Russo-Japanese War, he became concerned about the so-called Yellow Peril and worked with the federal Cabinet to explore alternatives to the head tax as a restriction on Asian immigration. He was nevertheless appalled by the 1907 anti-Asian riots in Vancouver, organised by the Asiatic Exclusion League, and, later in the same year, arranged a visit to Canada by Prince Fushimi Sadanaru of the Empire of Japan.|$|E

25|$|After {{the battle}} {{on the night}} of April 1, Fitzhugh Lee {{informed}} Robert E. Lee of the defeat and rout at Five Forks from Church's Crossing near the Ford Church's Road junction with the South Side Railroad where the remaining forces of Rooney Lee and Thomas Rosser joined him. Lee sent Lieutenant General Richard H. Anderson with his infantry to help Pickett reorganize and hold the South Side Railroad. Anderson left a small force behind and left Burgess Mill to join Fitzhugh Lee at about 6:30p.m. Anderson arrived about 2:00a.m. on April 2. General Lee's intention was to defend the South Side Railroad at Sutherland's Station. Anderson's force included Major General Bushrod Johnson's division, Brigadier General Eppa Hunton's brigade of Pickett's command, and the survivors of Pickett's task force at Five Forks. Lee also ordered troops from Richmond to come to Petersburg to help defend against attacks which <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be imminent.|$|E
25|$|Ichthyosaurs had fin-like {{limbs of}} varying {{relative}} length. The standard interpretation is that these, {{together with the}} dorsal fin and tail fin, were used as control surfaces for directional stability, controlling yaw, and for stabilising pitch and roll, rather than propulsion. However, during the 1980s the German paleontologist Jürgen Riess proposed an alternative model. After having studied the flying movement made by the forelimbs of plesiosaurs, he suggested that at least those ichthyosaurs that had long flippers used them for a powerful propulsive stroke, moving them up and down. This would explain the non-degenerated shoulder girdle {{and the evolution of}} the hand bones, whose perfect hydrofoil profile would have been useless if it was not functionally employed. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> have discovered modern analogues in the Queensland lungfish and the Amazon river dolphin, which he presumed also used their long fins for propulsion. Riess expounded upon this hypothesis in a series of articles. This alternative interpretation was generally not adopted by other workers. In 1998, Darren Naish pointed out that the lungfish and the river dolphin actually do not use their fins in this way and that e.g. the modern Humpback whale has very long front flippers, supported by a mosaic of bones, but that these nevertheless mainly serve as rudders. In 2013, a study concluded that broad ichthyosaur flippers, like those of Platyptergygius, were not used for propulsion but as a control surface.|$|E

500|$|During Eyeshield 21 {{original}} {{run in the}} magazine, Inagaki went to the United States to see {{college football}} matches, and National Football League games. Despite having never played American football, Inagaki chose this theme after deciding {{that he wanted to}} create [...] "a protagonist that was wimpy at the beginning, yet could perform outstandingly in a sports game", and with this premise in mind he decided that American football would be [...] "a very suitable material." [...] When originally creating Eyeshield 21 Inagaki said he was wary because he did not want his manga becoming [...] "a simulator of football". The fact that football is not a popular sport in Japan also worried Inagaki.

500|$|During the Dublin sessions, Eno {{was sent}} tapes of the {{previous}} two months' work, which he called a [...] "total disaster".

Eno theorised that the band {{was too close to}} their music, explaining, [...] "if you know a piece of music terribly well and the mix changes and the bass guitar goes very quiet, you still hear the bass. You're so accustomed to it being there that you compensate and remake it in your mind." [...] Eno also assisted them through a crisis point one month before the recording deadline; he recalled that [...] "everything seemed like a mess", and he insisted the band take a two-week holiday. The break gave them a clearer perspective and added decisiveness.|$|E
500|$|Jean became show runner of The Simpsons at {{the start}} of the third season (1991) {{together}} with Reiss.

[...] The first episode Jean and Reiss ran was [...] "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington" [...] (aired September 19, 1991), and they felt a lot of pressure on them to make it good. They were so pressured that they did six to seven rewrites of the script in order to improve its humor. Jean said he [...] "kept thinking 'It's not good enough. It's not good enough.'" [...] Reiss added that [...] "we were definitely scared. We had never run anything before, and they dumped us on this." ...|$|E

500|$|The Paratheria {{hypothesis}} {{enjoyed a}} brief renaissance when unusual, high-crowned teeth began {{turning up in}} the Cretaceous and Paleocene fossil record of Argentina. In 1984, Sudamerica ameghinoi, from the Paleocene of Argentina, was assigned to Xenarthra within Paratheria, ranked as a cohort (a taxonomic rank between infraclass and superorder). Two years later, José Bonaparte named Gondwanatherium patagonicum from the Late Cretaceous of Argentina, which <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be related to Sudamerica, and tentatively assigned it to Paratheria, now ranked as an infraclass. Bonaparte described an additional related animal, Vucetichia gracilis, from the Argentinean Late Cretaceous in 1990; by then he classified it in the order Gondwanatheria, which was tentatively assigned to the infraclass Paratheria. Bonaparte argued against George Gaylord Simpson's 1931 view that xenarthrans derive from the Tertiary Palaeanodonta of North America, and instead suggested that xenarthrans, and perhaps pangolins, split from eutherians (placentals and their extinct relatives) {{as early as the}} Early Cretaceous and derived from some early [...] "pantothere" [...] (a now-abandoned grouping of early mammals, including dryolestoids among others).|$|E
500|$|While Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto {{worked on}} Super Mario World, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> make Yoshi the series' [...] "next hero" [...] since the game {{designer}} {{did not like}} the other Yoshi games, including Yoshi's Safari and Yoshi's Cookie, and thought he could make something more authentic. When he first brought the game to Nintendo marketing, they declined the game for having Mario-style graphics rather than the vogue, computer pre-rendered graphics of Donkey Kong Country. In comparison, they felt that his game lacked the power to impress. Incensed and opposed to the style, Miyamoto instead further escalated his cartoonish visuals into a hand-drawn, crayon style. Nintendo's marketing department accepted this revision. Miyamoto later recalled feeling that the marketing department wanted [...] "better hardware and more beautiful graphics instead of ... art". Around the time of his rejection, Miyamoto allegedly said that [...] "Donkey Kong Country proves that players will put up with mediocre gameplay as long as the art is good". However, he later clarified his remarks, stating that [...] "recently some rumour got out that I didn't really like that game? I just want to clarify that that's not the case, because I was very involved in that. And even emailing almost daily with Tim Stamper right up until the end." ...|$|E
500|$|Game Informer ranked it the 81st {{best game}} ever made in its 100th issue in 2001.

Game Revolution categorized the game as [...] "a cross between Civilization II and [...] ", while GameSpot lamented that it was [...] "a simple combat game rather than a glorious empire-builder", describing it as [...] "Warcraft {{with a hint of}} Civilization." [...] While Computer Gaming Worlds Elliott Chin compared the game extensively to WarCraft II, he said that it has [...] "great depth, and when compared to its real-time brethren, it has to be the most sophisticated of the bunch". GameVortex wanted less of a combat-oriented gameplay, but praised the modes of play, commenting that [...] "the random map generation [...] really keeps the game spiced up." [...] GameSpot decried the level of micromanagement necessary to control the game (which was due to absence of production queues and low AI of the player's units) calling it [...] "a poor idea", which [...] "seriously diminishes AOE's enjoyability." [...] GameVortex echoed this criticism, while PC Gameworld pointed out the subsequently released patches improving some of the faulty AI programming. Elliott Chin criticized the game's population limit, which <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be its [...] "most serious grievance".|$|E
