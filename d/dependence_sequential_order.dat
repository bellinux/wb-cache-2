40|$|This paper proposes {{an optimistic}} {{concurrency}} control (CC) algorithm, called <b>Sequential</b> <b>Order</b> with Dynamic Adjustment (SODA), that guarantees timely and correct execution of concurrent transaction in Mobile P 2 P databases. In Mobile P 2 P, as every peer is fully autonomous, needs timely response and has inherent characteristics (mobility, low bandwidth, limited battery power, limited storage and frequent disconnections), existing CC algorithms cannot be applied directly. SODA {{is an effort}} to fill in this gap. The analysis of SODA shows that it is able to improve the response time by applying the concept of <b>sequential</b> <b>order</b> and reduce the transaction abort rate by dynamically adjusting the <b>sequential</b> <b>order...</b>|$|R

40|$|Voluntary actions {{require the}} {{concurrent}} engagement and coordinated control of complex temporal (e. g. rhythm) and ordinal motor processes. Using high-resolution functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) and multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), we sought to determine the degree to which these complex motor processes are dissociable in basal ganglia and cortical networks. We employed three different finger-tapping tasks that differed in the demand on the sequential temporal rhythm or <b>sequential</b> <b>ordering</b> of submovements. Our results demonstrate that sequential rhythm and <b>sequential</b> <b>order</b> tasks were partially dissociable based on activation differences. The sequential rhythm task activated a widespread network centered around the SMA and basal-ganglia regions including the dorsomedial putamen and caudate nucleus, while the <b>sequential</b> <b>order</b> task preferentially activated a fronto-parietal network. There was also extensive overlap between sequential rhythm and <b>sequential</b> <b>order</b> tasks, with both tasks commonly activating bilateral premotor, supplementary motor, and superior/inferior parietal cortical regions, as well as regions of the caudate/putamen of the basal ganglia and the ventro-lateral thalamus. Importantly, within the cortical regions that were active for both complex movements, MVPA could accurately classify different patterns of activation for the sequential rhythm and <b>sequential</b> <b>order</b> tasks. In the basal ganglia, however, overlapping activation for the sequential rhythm and <b>sequential</b> <b>order</b> tasks, which was found in classic motor circuits of the putamen and ventro-lateral thalamus, could not be accurately differentiated by MVPA. Overall, our results highlight the convergent architecture of the motor system, where complex motor information that is spatially distributed in the cortex converges into a more compact representation in the basal ganglia...|$|R

40|$|The <b>sequential</b> <b>ordering</b> {{problem is}} a graph problem with several {{applications}} in dierent Operations Research topics. One of them is scheduling problems. In this topic we can identify a solution of the <b>sequential</b> <b>ordering</b> problem with a solution sequence of a certain single machine scheduling problem associated. This paper uses these scheduling applications to study the <b>sequential</b> <b>ordering</b> problem from a stochastic approach, considering two hierarchical performance criteria. Note that in deterministic sequencing problems, given a solution, {{it is easy to}} check if it is feasible and to calculate its makespan. However, {{this is not the case}} in stochastic problems. Thus, the two criteria considered to formulate the Hierarchical Stochastic <b>Sequential</b> <b>Ordering</b> Problem (HSSOP) are: to maximize feasibility probability and to minimize expected makespan. The paper shows that this problem has maximun computational complexity. We develop these ideas and we study several alternatives to measure feasibility probability and expected makespan. We also compute bounds and values to estimate these quantities. Finally, we develop an approach to solve the problem and report a computational experience...|$|R
