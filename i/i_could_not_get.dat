500|$|Yeats finally visited Olivia at her Porchester Circle home a {{few weeks}} later to present his well-thought out {{intentions}} but, to his bewilderment, Olivia declared her love for him. Unsure of himself, he took another absence, during which he decided that if Maud was unattainable, or unavailable due to circumstances, he would have Olivia, writing [...] "but after all if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> the woman I loved it would be a comfort for a little while to devote myself to another". For Yeats, Olivia was willing to lose her daughter, financial security, social standing, and the goodwill of her family. Although her husband had grounds to sue Yeats and consequently destroy his reputation, her best hope against complete ruin was Shakespear's strong dislike of public scenes. Then Yeats lost his nerve again, suggesting instead each seek advice from a friend (a [...] "sponsor"). He probably chose Florence Farr to be his sponsor while Olivia chose Valentine Fox—Harwood speculates that the sponsors advised the two {{to go ahead with the}} affair, perhaps to Yeats' discomfort.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{cancellation}} of Star Trek, Roddenberry felt typecast as a producer of science fiction, despite his background in Westerns and police stories. He later described the period, saying, [...] "My dreams were going downhill because <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> work after the original series was cancelled." [...] He {{felt that he was}} [...] "perceived as the guy who made the show that was an expensive flop." [...] Roddenberry had sold his interest in Star Trek to Paramount Studios in return for a third of the ongoing profits. However, this did not result in any quick financial gain; the studio was still claiming that the series was $500,000 in the red in 1982. He wrote and produced Pretty Maids All in a Row (1971), a sexploitation film directed by Roger Vadim, for MGM. The cast included Rock Hudson, Angie Dickinson, Telly Savalas, and Roddy McDowall alongside Star Trek regular James Doohan, and William J. Campbell, who had appeared as a guest in two Star Trek episodes, [...] "The Squire Of Gothos" [...] and [...] "The Trouble With Tribbles". Variety was unimpressed: [...] "Whatever substance was in the original [...] or screen concept has been plowed under, leaving only superficial, one-joke results." [...] Herbert Solow had given Roddenberry the work as a favor, paying him $100,000 for the script.|$|E

500|$|Chris Carabott from IGN [...] "loved" [...] Tom's first {{appearance}} because [...] "It's a great scene and our first introduction to The Others besides Ethan's infiltration of the camp." [...] Gainey found the fan {{reaction to his}} {{first appearance}} [...] "really tough", because [...] "everywhere [...] went people would just give [...] dirty looks and they were like 'What {{are you going to}} do with that boy?'", but he noted this gradually improved after his appearances in season two. Erin Martell from AOL's TV Squad listed Tom in her five [...] "most entertaining guest roles" [...] from the first three seasons, commenting [...] "I am counting his first episode as my favorite. For my money, there was nothing more disturbing than when Gainey showed up out of the blue and uttered the words, 'We're gonna have to take the boy.' <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> that scene out of my head for days after 'Exodus' aired. Ben has made Tom seem relatively less menacing over time, but I have a feeling that the terrifying, bearded sea captain is still in there somewhere." [...] In her review of the season four episode [...] "The Other Woman", Nikki Stafford of Wizard called the return of her [...] "favorite Other" [...] (Tom) a [...] "highlight". Following his posthumous flashback appearance in [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson", Martell said [...] "Now I feel even worse about his death. He wasn't just one of Ben's scary, Walt-napping minions. He had a heart." [...] Tim Goodman from the San Francisco Chronicle thought the revelation that Tom is gay was a [...] "unique and funny twist". Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post noted this revelation [...] "seemed a little oddly placed, kind of like 'Let's make one of our characters gay just for the heck of it' but still it's cool that the show has a perfectly normal (well for an 'Other') not over-the-top gay character." ...|$|E

The Portuguese horsemen were routed and three cannons were lost. A frustrated D'Urban wrote of his troopers, [...] "At Salamanca they followed me into the enemy's ranks like British dragoons; yesterday they were so far from doing their duty {{that in the first}} charge they just went far enough to land me in the enemy's ranks. In the second, which (having got them rallied) I rashly attempted, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> them within 20 yards of the enemy – they left me alone, and vanished before the French helmets like leaves before the autumn wind." ...|$|E
2500|$|As a {{young worker}} in the women's rights movement, Anthony {{expressed}} frustration when some of her co-workers began to marry and have children, sharply curtailing their ability {{to work for the}} understaffed movement. When Lucy Stone abandoned her pledge to stay single, Anthony's scolding remarks caused a temporary rupture in their friendship. Journalists repeatedly asked Anthony to explain why she never married. She answered one by saying, [...] "It always happened that the men I wanted were those <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get,</b> and those who wanted me I wouldn't have." [...] To another she answered, [...] "I never found the man who was necessary to my happiness. I was very well as I was." [...] To a third she said, [...] "I never felt I could give up my life of freedom to become a man's housekeeper. When I was young, if a girl married poor, she became a housekeeper and a drudge. If she married wealth she became a pet and a doll. Just think, had I married at twenty, I would have been a drudge or a doll for fifty-nine years. Think of it!" ...|$|E

After some time, there stept out of the Cabin a man in cinnamon-colored coat with gold button-HOLES; in black wig; face and coat considerably dusted with Spanish snuff. He looked fixedly at me, for a while; and then said, without farther preface, 'Who are you, Monsieur?' This cavalier tone from an unknown person, whose exterior indicated nothing very important, did not please me; and I declined satisfying his curiosity. He was silent. But, some time after, he took a more courteous tone, and said: 'Come in here to me, Monsieur! You will be better here than in the Steerage, amid the tobacco-smoke.'
