50|$|In September 2011, Berry Plastics {{acquired}} 100% of {{the capital}} stock of Rexam SBC for an aggregate purchase price of $351 million ($340 million, net of cash acquired), financing the purchase with cash on hand and existing credit facilities. Rexam produces rigid packaging, notably plastic closures, fitments and <b>dispensing</b> <b>closure</b> systems, and jars. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, accordingly allocating the purchase price to the identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values at the acquisition date.|$|E

Its container lines include plastic bottles and jars, glass bottles and jars, metal cans and tins, pails and drums. Child-resistant, tamper-evident, and non-dispensing container caps are leading products in its closures line, while its dispensing systems include household and industrial trigger sprayers, lotion and treatment pumps, fine mist sprayers and foamer systems.|$|R
50|$|The corporation, {{acquired}} as Akheny Co. by Albert J. Weatherhead in 1971, {{designs and}} manufactures <b>dispensing</b> <b>closure</b> products for packaging. The caps are injection-molded and made from polypropylene. The corporation’s customer base includes chemical, healthcare, dry food, pet food and seasoning products, {{as well as}} liquid condiments, creamers and specialty milks. Weatherchem received ISO 9001 quality certification in 1995 and was recognized compliant with GMA-SAFE (Supplier Audits for Food Excellence) in 2006. Food companies such as McCormick, Kraft and Nestle use GMA- SAFE to confirm that suppliers comply with agreed-upon safety and security standards.|$|E
5000|$|Weatherchem Corporation, {{headquartered}} in Twinsburg, Ohio, designs and manufactures plastic dispensing closures for packaging. Founded with {{the acquisition of}} Akheny Co. in 1971, Weatherchem created the original Flapper <b>dispensing</b> <b>closure.</b> Weatherchem’s customers include manufacturers of food, chemical and personal-care products. In 2001, Weatherchem was the first company to roll out a revolutionary new e-commerce solution in the packaging industry, teaming with the e-commerce company eWinWin and licensing eWinWin’s patent-pending technology called the Demand Aggregation System, or DAS, to enable buyers to aggregate orders on-line to lower their costs. After adding four new all-electric Engel presses to its cap-making operation in 2009, Plastic News magazine reported that “Weatherchem Corp. stands {{as an example of}} how an injection molder can remain healthy in down times and flourish in good times.” ...|$|E
50|$|Weatherchem’s {{standard}} line includes {{products with}} flap-style dispensing for one-handed use, {{as well as}} products with non-removable grinders. Weatherchem’s original Flapper <b>Dispensing</b> <b>Closure</b> was introduced in 1983. That patented technology {{is used in the}} food industry by such companies as McCormick, {{as well as in the}} healthcare, personal-care and chemical industries. Weatherchem’s NutraFlapper can be found on Nature Made and similar product lines, while its Agricap, a heavy-duty, tamper-evident closure, can be found in the agricultural chemicals market. In 2006, the company introduced four new products: the Grinder NR, LiquiFlapper, FlapMate and NutraGen II. The Grinder NR is a dry-spice packaging system with a non-removable grinder and a non-refillable polyethylene container. (The Grinder NR design is specifically intended to discourage reuse in order to force consumers to purchase high-profit-margin new units instead of simply refilling already-purchased units with economical bulk spices.) LiquiFlapper is used for the controlled dispensing of liquid products. The sift-resistant FlapMate eliminates the need for liner removal. NutraGen II is designed for the dispensing of larger pills. Through its technical services group, Weatherchem provides in-line manufacturing trials, product performance studies and guidance on sustainability practices in manufacturing.|$|E

The barrier may include an elongate support structure and a closure cap...|$|E
40|$|The <b>dispensing</b> <b>closure</b> {{used for}} {{containers}} {{plays an important}} role in protecting cosmetics from in-use microbial contamination. This hypothesis was tested by aseptically packing unpreserved shampoo and skin lotion into containers with three different closure types which provided various degrees of protection against consumer and environmental microbial insults. Shampoo was packed in containers with slit-cap (n = 25), flip-cap (n = 25), or screw-cap (n = 28) closures. Skin lotion was packed in containers with pump-top (n = 21), flip-cap (n = 18), or screw-cap (n = 21) closures. The products were then used by volunteers under actual in-use conditions for 3 (shampoo) or 2 (skin lotion) weeks. After use, the products were evaluated for microbial contamination by using standard methods for enumeration and identification. The standard screw-cap closure provided only minimal protection against microbial contamination of both the shampoo (29 % contamination incidence) and the skin lotion (71 %). The slit-cap closure on the shampoo container and the flip-cap closure on the skin lotion container provided slightly enhanced degrees of protection (21 and 39 % contamination incidence, respectively). The greatest amount of protection (i. e., lowest contamination incidence) was provided by the flip-cap closure for the shampoo container (0 %) and the pump-top closure for the skin lotion container (10 %). As a result, closure type {{plays an important role}} in protecting poorly preserved products from in-use microbial contamination...|$|E
