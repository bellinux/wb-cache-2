5|$|Although the MP 40 was {{generally}} reliable, a major weakness was its 32-round magazine. Unlike the double-column, dual-feed magazine insert {{found on the}} Thompson M1921-28 variants, the MP 40 used a double-column, single-feed insert. The single-feed insert resulted in increased friction against the remaining cartridges moving upwards towards the feed lips, occasionally resulting <b>in</b> <b>feed</b> failures; this problem was exacerbated {{by the presence of}} dirt or other debris. Another problem was that the magazine was also sometimes misused as a handhold. This could cause the weapon to malfunction when hand pressure on the magazine body caused the magazine lips {{to move out of the}} line of feed, since the magazine well did not keep the magazine firmly locked. German soldiers were trained to grasp either the handhold on the underside of the weapon or the magazine housing with the supporting hand to avoid feed malfunctions.|$|E

Conversely, factors that favor plate columns are: presence of solids <b>in</b> <b>feed,</b> high liquid rates, large column diameters, complex columns, columns with wide feed composition variation, columns with a chemical reaction, absorption columns, columns limited by foundation weight tolerance, low liquid rate, large turn-down ratio and those processes subject to process surges.|$|E

Manuelito and Barboncito reminded the Navajo that the Army was bringing in troops to wage war, it had flogged a Navajo messenger, and opened fire on tribal headsman Agua Chiquito, during talks for peace. They argued that the army had refused to bring <b>in</b> <b>feed</b> for their many animals at Ft. Defiance, took over the prime grazing land, and killed Manuelito's livestock that was there. On April 30, 1860, Manuelito and Barboncito with 1,000 Navajo warriors attacked the fort and almost took control.|$|E
25|$|The natural {{concentrations}} of vitamins in bovine milk samples can differ significantly {{as a result}} of a number of factors, including cow breed, season, country, vitamin concentrations <b>in</b> <b>feed,</b> and frequency of milkings. However, changes resulting from pasteurization are likely dependent on the time and temperature of pasteurization conditions. Meta-regression was used to assess the roles of time and temperature in between-study heterogeneity. The duration of pasteurization was positively correlated with folate concentrations, and a direct inverse relationship was found between pasteurization temperature and vitamin C concentrations. Multivariate analysis of time and temperature revealed a significant negative correlation between these variables and vitamin B2 concentrations. These results indicate a likely relationship between time, temperature, and vitamin concentrations in milk; however, further research is needed to tease apart these effects because they appear to differ by vitamin.|$|E

500|$|In a {{continuous}} distillation, {{the system is}} kept in a steady state or approximate steady state. [...] Steady state means that quantities related to the process do not change as time passes during operation. [...] Such constant quantities include feed input rate, output stream rates, heating and cooling rates, reflux ratio, and temperatures, pressures, and compositions at every point (location). [...] Unless the process is disturbed due to changes <b>in</b> <b>feed,</b> heating, ambient temperature, or condensing, steady state is normally maintained. [...] This is also the main attraction of continuous distillation, apart from the minimum amount of (easily instrumentable) surveillance; if the feed rate and feed composition are kept constant, product rate and quality are also constant. [...] Even when a variation in conditions occurs, modern process control methods are commonly able to gradually return the continuous process to another steady state again.|$|E
500|$|The {{digestive}} {{system of the}} horse is somewhat delicate. [...] Horses are unable to regurgitate food, except from the esophagus. [...] Thus, if they overeat or eat something poisonous, vomiting is not an option. [...] They also have a long, complex large intestine and a balance of beneficial microbes in their cecum that can be upset by rapid changes <b>in</b> <b>feed.</b> [...] Because of these factors, they are very susceptible to colic, which is {{a leading cause of}} death in horses. [...] Therefore, horses require clean, high-quality feed, provided at regular intervals, and may become ill if subjected to abrupt changes in their diets. Horses are also sensitive to molds and toxins. [...] For this reason, they must never be fed contaminated fermentable materials such as lawn clippings. [...] Fermented silage or [...] "haylage" [...] is fed to horses in some places; however, contamination or failure of the fermentation process that allows any mold or spoilage may be toxic.|$|E

The Brelands {{went on to}} train [...] "more animals and different species of animals than any other animal trainers" [...] of their time, including animals of the land (cats, cattle, chickens, dogs, goats, pigs, rabbits, raccoons, rats, and sheep), the air (ducks, parrots, and ravens), and the sea (dolphins and whales). At their busiest, they trained [...] "more than 1,000 animals at a given time". In training animals for recreational facilities such as Marineland of Florida, Parrot Jungle, SeaWorld, and Six Flags, they created the very first dolphin and bird shows, a form of program now considered traditional entertainment fare. Most major theme parks' animal programs {{can be traced back}} to the Brelands' pioneering work. The Brelands also established the first coin-operated animal shows. The Buck Bunny commercial featured their trained rabbits for a Coast Federal Savings television ad that ran for twenty years and which still holds the record for longest running TV commercial advertisement. They trained animals for many other venues including circuses, motion pictures, museums, stores, and zoos.|$|E

40|$|Pigs require {{energy for}} {{maintenance}} and productive purposes, and an accurate amount of available energy <b>in</b> <b>feeds</b> {{should be provided}} according to their energy requirement. Available energy <b>in</b> <b>feeds</b> for pigs has been characterized as DE, ME, or NE by considering sequential energy losses during digestion and metabolism from GE <b>in</b> <b>feeds.</b> Among these energy values, the NE system has been recognized as providing energy values of ingredients and diets that most closely describes the available energy to animals because it takes the heat increment from digestive utilization and metabolism of feeds into account. However, NE values for diets and individual ingredients are moving targets, and therefore, none of the NE systems are able to accurately predict truly available energy <b>in</b> <b>feeds.</b> The DE or ME values for feeds are important for predicting NE values, but depend on the growth stage of pigs (i. e., BW) due to the different abilities of nutrient digestion, especially for dietary fiber. The NE values are also influenced by both environment that affects NE requirement for maintenance (NEm) and the growth stage of pigs that differs in nutrient utilization (i. e., protein vs. lipid synthesis) in the body. Therefore, the interaction among animals, environment, and feed characteristics {{should be taken into}} consideration for advancing feed energy evaluation. A more mechanistic approach has been adopted in Denmark as potential physiological energy (PPE) for feeds, which is based on the theoretical biochemical utilization of energy <b>in</b> <b>feeds</b> for pigs. The PPE values are, therefore, believed to be independent of animals and environment.
