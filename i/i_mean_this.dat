500|$|Spicer says [...] "Roger Moore re-created Bond as an old-style debonair hero, more {{polished}} and sophisticated than Connery's incarnation, using the mocking insouciance he had perfected {{in his role}} as Simon Templar... Moore's humour was a throwaway, and certainly in the later films, verged on self-parody. It was an essential strand in the increasingly tongue-in-cheek direction of the series which became more light-hearted, knowing and playfully intertextual". Chapman noted that Moore was the most comedic of the Bonds, with a more light-hearted approach to playing the character with a mocking wit and innuendo. Additionally, Moore's one-liners were delivered in a way to suggest that the violence inherent in the films was a joke, as opposed to Connery's, which was used to mitigate the violence. Moore explained his approach to the humour by saying [...] "to me, the Bond situations are so ridiculous... <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>this</b> man {{is supposed to be a}} spy, and yet everybody knows he's a spy... it's outrageous. So you have to treat the humour outrageously as well".|$|E
500|$|The {{other members}} of Blaster Masters {{development}} team created the system of alternating between the 2D platforming and top-down modes. During the game's planning, the team {{came up with the}} idea that SOPHIA would eventually be able to go anywhere in the game, including navigating on the ceilings and walls. The team created the top-down portions to allow Jason to shoot in all directions and to enable them to [...] "express large bosses that really had an impact". They did not want to design the gameplay in a linear progression; instead they drew inspiration from and were influenced by Nintendo's Metroid to create a game that allowed players to freely move between levels. According to Iwata: [...] "We wanted the player to experience the feeling of excitement that comes from discovering something after endeavoring through a difficult search, which is why we composed a map that allowed the player to move freely between different areas. We really put a great deal of thought into that element of the game design and, <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>this</b> in the best possible way, but we wanted the player to have to struggle." ...|$|E
2500|$|Speaking in Oxford {{after the}} May 2015 {{same-sex}} marriage referendum in Ireland, Burke {{said that he}} struggled to understand [...] "any nation redefining marriage... <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>this</b> is a defiance of God. It's just incredible. Pagans may have tolerated homosexual behaviours, they never dared to say this was marriage." [...] Archbishop Eamon Martin of Armagh rebuked Burk and called his comments offensive and urged individuals [...] "to try to be respectful and inoffensive in language" [...] wherever possible.|$|E

2500|$|Huckabee echoed his {{statement}} {{when he appeared}} on Face the Nation {{on the morning of}} August 12. [...] "We're in fact in the first tier, I think, by everybody's estimation, and here's why," [...] Huckabee told Jim Axelrod. [...] "It wasn't just that we surprised people with a second showing, it's that we did it with so few resources. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>this</b> really was feeding the 5,000 with two fish and five loaves, an amazing kind of day for us." [...] Looking beyond Iowa, former Governor of South Carolina and Huckabee supporter David Beasley said that Huckabee is filling the void created by the lack of a social conservative in the race. He said that [...] "I really believe now that the conservative voters will begin to coalesce behind Mike Huckabee...and it's going to be infectious in New Hampshire and South Carolina" ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding {{the sheer}} size of Callas's instrument, Celletti says, [...] "Her voice was penetrating. The volume as such was average: neither small nor powerful. But the penetration, allied to this incisive quality (which bordered on the ugly because it {{frequently}} contained an element of harshness) ensured that her voice could be clearly heard anywhere in the auditorium." [...] Rodolfo Celletti wrote that Callas had [...] "a voluminous, penetrating, and dark voice" [...] ("una voce voluminosa, squillante e di timbro scuro"). After her first performance of Medea in 1953, the critic for Musical Courier wrote that [...] "she displayed a vocal generosity that was scarcely believable for its amplitude and resilience." [...] In a 1982 Opera News interview with Joan Sutherland and Richard Bonynge, Bonynge stated, [...] "But before she slimmed down, <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>this</b> was such a colossal voice. It just poured out of her, the way Flagstad's did.... Callas had a huge voice. When she and Stignani sang Norma, {{at the bottom of the}} range you could barely tell who was who ... Oh it was colossal. And she took the big sound right up to the top." [...] In his book, Michael Scott makes the distinction that whereas Callas's pre-1954 voice was a [...] "dramatic soprano with an exceptional top", after the weight loss, it became, as one Chicago critic described the voice in Lucia, a [...] "huge soprano leggiero".|$|E
2500|$|Kevin Harvick {{dominated}} {{the race to}} score the victory. [...] "Wow. I guess that's {{what it feels like}} to hit a walkoff in extra innings. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>this</b> thing -- both races here -- has been bad to the bone," [...] Harvick said after winning his fourth race at this 1-mile oval in the last five tries. Harvick would not have made the final four to race for the title without a win. I could tell that we were going to have to win because everybody was running in the front of the pack that we were racing against. I think this says a lot about our team. We had our backs against the wall. We're in victory lane and we get to go on." [...] In the final turn, Ryan Newman sent Kyle Larson into the wall to secure his place in the championship race. “I just gave it my all,” Newman said. “I wasn’t proud of it but did what I had to get to this next round. That little boy has got a lot of things coming in this sport and he used me up like that in a truck at Eldora a couple years ago. From my standpoint, I call it even but I think if he was in my position, he’d have done the same thing.” [...] "Coming to the finish, there were a lot of cars racing really hard,” said Larson today. “I knew (Newman) was right around me and knew he needed to gain some spots to keep from getting eliminated from the Chase. It's a little upsetting he pushed me up to the wall, but I completely understand the situation he was in,” said Larson, “(I) can't fault him for being aggressive there. I think a lot of drivers out here would have done something similar if they were in that position." [...] Kevin Harvick (with the much-needed win), Joey Logano, Denny Hamlin, and Ryan Newman were the four drivers who will race for the championship, which also meant that NASCAR will be having a new Sprint Cup Series champion. Jeff Gordon, Carl Edwards, Brad Keselowski, and Matt Kenseth were the four drivers eliminated.|$|E
