Mike Lazzo, {{executive}} vice president of Adult Swim, had never [...] "responded to the show" [...] as Small had noted, which was in stark contrast to Vice President of Original Series Khaki Jones, whose enthusiasm over the series was what Small admitted to keeping it alive. During the production run for the fourth season, Lazzo had informed the crew bluntly that the season would conclude the series, explaining, [...] "No matter what the numbers are, no matter what happens – we're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>the</b> show back." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{cast and}} crew were very {{emotional}} during filming, as they were concerned {{that this might be}} the last episode ever filmed and the series cancelled if the strike was a lengthy one. [...] Olmos helped to work up the cast's emotions for the shoot by telling everyone that the show was ending. [...] According to co-writer Weddle, Olmos repeatedly told the cast, [...] "This is the end, I think we all feel that. [...] They're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>the</b> show back. [...] They'll pull the sets down. [...] We'll never shoot another episode." [...] Actress Kandyse McClure improvised the lullaby her character hums before committing suicide, and series composer Bear McCreary used the melody for part of the episode's musical soundtrack.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} by {{television}} critics were mostly positive, noting its [...] "hilarious beginning and the nice ending." [...] Dan Iverson of IGN praised the episode, stating that the episode [...] "looks to show that this fifth season is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>the</b> series back to the irreverent basics that made it so appealing." [...] Iverson went on to comment {{that some of the}} jokes were [...] "extremely funny" [...] and that [...] "the episode had it all, from the Electric Company bit to making fun of people who drive Hummers and watch movies like Madagascar." [...] In the conclusion of his review, Iverson gave the episode an eight out of ten. Brett Love of TV Squad also gave the episode a positive review, calling the installment much better than the previous two episode's from the season, [...] "Stewie Loves Lois" [...] and [...] "Mother Tucker", but criticized the storyline's similarity to the South Park episode [...] "Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes". Love commented negatively on the portrayal of Peter working at the superstore, however, stating, [...] "it's a fine line when they go retarded with Peter. Sometimes it plays really funny, and sometimes it just gets annoying." ...|$|E

60|$|A disagreeable shudder crept over me, but I {{did my best}} against it. It {{was not to be}} denied, I rejoined, {{that this}} was a {{remarkable}} coincidence, calculated deeply to impress his mind. But it was unquestionable that remarkable coincidences did continually occur, and they {{must be taken into account}} in dealing with such a subject. Though to be sure I must admit, I added (for I thought I saw that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>the</b> objection to bear upon me), men of common sense did not allow much for coincidences in making the ordinary calculations of life.|$|E

2500|$|Ellen E Jones from The Independent though Dyer in EastEnders seemed [...] "inevitable" [...] {{and called}} him [...] "the cockney messiah [...] come to save EastEnders". She said that Dyer walks the [...] "thin line between {{national}} treasure and national laughing stock", so EastEnders—"which works best when it's an overblown cockney pantomime"—would be Dyer's [...] "natural home". Kevin O'Sullivan from the Daily Mirror {{said that it would}} take more than hiring Dyer to [...] "stop the rot", as fans were getting [...] "fed up" [...] of watching the show. Katy Brent from the Daily Mirror said: [...] "I'm kind of intrigued to see what Danny Dyer is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> table, or bar in his case, but I think it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take me a little while to be convinced by him.

How do you do, Mrs. Mandel, Miss Christine, Mela, Aunt Hitty, and all the folks? How you wuz?" [...] He shook hands gayly all round, and took a chair next the old lady, whose hand he kept in his own, and left Conrad to introduce Beaton. But he would not let the shadow of Beaton's solemnity fall upon the company. He began to joke with Mrs. Dryfoos, and to match rheumatisms with her, and he included all the ladies in the range of appropriate pleasantries. [...] "I've brought Mr. Beaton along to-night, and I want you to make him feel at home, like you do me, Mrs. Dryfoos. He hasn't got any rheumatism to speak of; but his parents live in Syracuse, and he's a kind of an orphan, and we've just adopted him down at the office. When you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>the</b> young ladies down there, Mrs. Mandel, for a champagne lunch? I will have some hydro-Mela, and Christine it, heigh? How's that for a little starter? We dropped in at your place a moment, Mrs. March, and gave the young folks a few pointers about their studies. My goodness! it does me good to see a boy like that of yours; business, from the word go; and your girl just scoops my youthful affections. She's a beauty, and I guess she's good, too. Well, well, what a world it is! Miss Christine, won't you show Mr. Beaton that seal ring of yours? He knows about such things, and I brought him here to see it as much as anything. It's an intaglio I brought from the other side," [...] he explained to Mrs. March, [...] "and I guess you'll like to look at it. Tried to give it to the Dryfoos family, and when I couldn't, I sold it to 'em. Bound to see it on Miss Christine's hand somehow! Hold on! Let him see it where it belongs, first!" ...|$|E

I make a leg for Captain Ahab, and he wears it like a gentleman; but I make a bandbox for Queequeg, and he won't put his head into it. Are all my pains to go for nothing with that coffin? And now I'm ordered to make a life-buoy of it. It's like turning an old coat; <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>the</b> flesh {{on the other side}} now. I don't like this {{cobbling}} sort of business-- I don't like it at all; it's undignified; it's not my place. Let tinkers' brats do tinkerings; we are their betters. I like to take in hand none but clean, virgin, fair-and-square mathematical jobs, something that regularly begins at the beginning, and is at the middle when midway, and comes to an end at the conclusion; not a cobbler's job, that's at an end in the middle, and at the beginning at the end. It's the old woman's tricks to be giving cobbling jobs. Lord! what an affection all old women have for tinkers. I know an old woman of sixty-five who ran away with a bald-headed young tinker once. And that's the reason I never would work for lonely widow old women ashore when I kept my job-shop in the Vineyard; they might have taken it into their lonely old heads to run off with me. But heigh-ho! there are no caps at sea but snow-caps. Let me see. Nail down the lid; caulk the seams; pay over the same with pitch; batten them down tight, and hang it with the snap-spring over the ship's stern. Were ever such things done before with a coffin? Some superstitious old carpenters, now, would be tied up in the rigging, ere they would do the job. But I'm made of knotty Aroostook hemlock; I don't budge. Cruppered with a coffin! Sailing about with a grave-yard tray! But never mind. We workers in woods make bridal bedsteads and card-tables, as well as coffins and hearses. We work by the month, or by the job, or by the profit; not for us to ask the why and wherefore of our work, unless it be too confounded cobbling, and then we stash it if we can. Hem! I'll do the job, now, tenderly. I'll have me--let's see--how many in the ship's company, all told? But I've forgotten. Any way, I'll have me thirty separate, Turk's-headed life-lines, each three feet long hanging all round to the coffin. Then, if the hull go down, there'll be thirty lively fellows all fighting for one coffin, a sight not seen very often beneath the sun! Come hammer, caulking-iron, pitch-pot, and marling-spike! Let's to it." ...|$|E
