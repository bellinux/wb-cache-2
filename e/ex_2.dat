40|$|Various {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} proposed to explain the function of alloparental behavior in cooperatively breeding species. We examined whether alloparental experience as juveniles enhanced later parental care and reproductive success in the prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster), a cooperatively breeding rodent. Juveniles cared for one litter of siblings (1 EX), two litters of siblings (<b>2</b> <b>EX)</b> or no siblings (0 EX). As adults, these individuals were mated to other 0 EX, 1 <b>EX</b> or <b>2</b> <b>EX</b> voles, yielding seven different pair combinations, and we recorded measures of parental behaviors, reproductive success, and pup development. As juveniles, individuals caring for siblings {{for the first time}} were more alloparental; and as adults, 0 EX females paired with 0 EX males spent more time in the nest with their pups. Taken together, these results suggest that inexperienced animals spend more time in infant care. As parents, 1 EX males spent more time licking their pups than <b>2</b> <b>EX</b> and 0 EX males. Pups with either a 1 <b>EX</b> or <b>2</b> <b>EX</b> parent gained weight faster than pups with 0 EX parents during certain developmental periods. While inexperienced animals may spend more time in pup care, long-term benefits of alloparenting may become apparent in the display of certain, particularly important parental behaviors such as licking pups, and in faster weight gain of offspring. © 2009 Elsevier B.

40|$|Aim: To {{study the}} gastric {{emptying}} 30 days after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (NF) in gastroesophageal reflux. Materials and Methods: Three patients were evaluated with 13 C-acetate breath test (ABT) performed pre and post-NF. The liquid test meal consisted of Racol TM mixed with 13 C-acetate. Results: In the patient without neurological impairment (NI), the preoperative t 1 / <b>2</b> <b>ex</b> and t lag were 0. 900 and 0. 510 hours, respectively. The postoperative t 1 / <b>2</b> <b>ex</b> and t lag were 0. 959 and 0. 586 hours, respectively.

50|$|Developed as a {{joint project}} between the US Navy and the DuPont Chemical company, the EX 1 and <b>EX</b> <b>2</b> {{were part of}} the Target Illumination and Recovery Aid (TIARA) program. DuPont created a number of {{essentially}} glow-in-the-dark fillers, finally settling on the non-toxic PB-155 compound. PB-155 (also known as TIARA 5) glows when it oxidizes and therefore could be used to mark things at night with minimal fuss. Developed specifically for the US Navy SEALs, the first production models were created in 1963. The EX 1 Mod 0 was a hand grenade, based on the M25A2 chemical grenade described in the following section. Testing in 1963 showed that the TIARA 5 mixture had averse effects on the functioning of the C12 fuze integral to the M25A2 design. This led to the replacement of the fuze's integral primer, the M39A1, with a model that was resistant to the filler mixture, the M5. The <b>EX</b> <b>2</b> Mod 0, visibly more similar to other cylindrical smoke and chemical grenades (such as the AN/M8 and M18 discussed in this section) was designed {{to be used as a}} rifle grenade using the M2 series of grenade launcher adapters.|$|E
