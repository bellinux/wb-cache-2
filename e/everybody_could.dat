If the water supply at the {{hospital}} failed, he would take a [...] tubing and connect to the garden tap so <b>everybody</b> <b>could</b> scrub up for surgery. This need to improvise and adapt inspired Panday to develop a surgical procedure called the Panday shunt used for mitral valve replacement.|$|E

All of the songs featured on Internet Leaks were later included on Yankovic's thirteenth studio album, Alpocalypse. The EP was meant as a stop-gap, because he [...] "wanted to make the tracks available so <b>everybody</b> <b>could</b> enjoy them as early as possible." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{had to be}} a cost. There {{had to be a}} price {{somebody}} {{paid for}} that discovery. Not <b>everybody</b> <b>could</b> take that. Not everyone could just say, [...] "OK, that didn't work out, let's go on to next week's episode." [...] It felt like somebody would just say, [...] "No, I'm done. I just want to find a little moment of time where I can feel good about myself one last time, then I'm finished with this long nightmare." [...] And that seemed like that would be Dualla.|$|E

500|$|It {{is a very}} {{important}} film, Life, and Nothing More..., in that what was filmed was inspired by a journey I had made just three days after an earthquake. And I speak not only of the film itself but also of the experience of being in that place, where only three days before 50,000 people had died. For the survivors, {{it was as if they}} were reborn, having experienced death around them. The earthquake had happened at four or five in the morning, so in a sense <b>everybody</b> <b>could</b> have been dead and it was almost accidental that they hadn't died. So I didn't just see myself as a film director here, but also as an observer of people who had been condemned to death. So this was a very big influence on me, and the issue of life and death from then on does recur in my films[...]|$|E
500|$|Historian Alex von Tunzelmann {{gave the}} film a mixed review in The Guardian: [...] "The Girl {{is perhaps a}} more {{effective}} piece of film-making than Hitchcock, though it is also more questionable in its portrayal of the directorhe film depicts [...] accurately, though Jones's Hitchcock {{appears to be more}} gratified by the spectacle than the real Hitch was". Simon quotes Donald Spoto's book The Dark Side of Genius (1983), in which Hedren told Spoto [...] " [...] was terribly upset by all this"; screenwriter Evan Hunter said, [...] "e wanted to shoot it, but something in him didn't want to shoot it, and <b>everybody</b> <b>could</b> hear how nervous he was". Nancy deWolf Smith of The Wall Street Journal wrote that the film should not be viewed in terms of truths or untruths, but instead as [...] "an exquisitely lurid morality play in the Hitchcock style", calling The Girl [...] "an original masterpiece that pays tribute to Hitchcock's talent and vision".|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Crosby {{insisted upon}} the {{inclusion}} of the contentious track [...] "Mind Gardens", which was disliked by the other band members and derided by McGuinn as having no [...] "rhythm, meter, or rhyme". [...] In conversation with Byrds biographer Johnny Rogan in 1980, Crosby defended the song by stating [...] "it was unusual and not <b>everybody</b> <b>could</b> understand it because they'd never heard anything like it before. At that time everything was supposed to have rhyme and have rhythm. And it neither rhymed nor had rhythm, so it was outside of their experience. It was just a little story and what it said was true ... if you build walls around your mind to keep out the abuse and harshness of life and the pain, then you also shut out the joy and the love." [...] Although [...] "Mind Gardens" [...] is often dismissed by critics and fans for being self-indulgent, Rogan has noted that its raga rock ambiance, symbolic lyrics and attractive backwards guitar effects capture the Byrds at their most creatively ambitious.|$|E
2500|$|Thai city-states {{gradually}} became {{independent of the}} weakened Khmer Empire. It is said that Sukhothai Kingdom was established as a strong sovereign kingdom by Sri Indraditya in 1238. A political feature which [...] "classic" [...] Thai historians call [...] "father governs children" [...] existed at this time. <b>Everybody</b> <b>could</b> bring their problems to the king directly, as there was a bell {{in front of the}} palace for this purpose. The city briefly dominated the area under King Ram Khamhaeng, who tradition and legend states established the Thai alphabet, but after his death in 1365, Sukhothai fell into decline and became subject to another emerging Thai state, the Ayutthaya Kingdom in the lower Chao Phraya area.|$|E
2500|$|Wilder went to {{the awards}} {{ceremony}} expecting to win even though the studio had been backing their other big hit of the year, Leo McCarey's Going My Way, and studio employees were expected {{to vote for the}} studio favorite. As the awards show wore on and Double Indemnity lost in category after category, it became evident {{that there would be a}} Going My Way sweep. McCarey beamed as his picture won award after award and when he was named Best Director, Wilder could no longer take it. When McCarey got up to make his way to the stage to accept the award for best picture, Wilder, sitting on the aisle, stuck out his foot and tripped him. [...] "Mr. McCarey...stumbled perceptibly," [...] he gleefully recalled. After the ceremony while he and his wife Judith were waiting for his limousine to arrive, he yelled out so loudly that <b>everybody</b> <b>could</b> hear him, [...] "What the hell does the Academy Award mean, for God's sake?

60|$|It {{was very}} unpleasant.

60|$|Mrs. Pullet was silent, {{having to}} finish her crying, and rather flattered than indignant at being upbraided for crying too much.

2500|$|Seems Zoya Vinogradova was {{an actress}} only and before {{performance}} of Mister X {{her name and}} family name could be jargoned due to Mister X Intelligence services program. It can be confirmed by jargon [...] "a poisonous snake" [...] with has commencement from 1970-x. One school-girl Zoya and her parents were sent to Odessa in 1974 or 1975 from the Volga region about. She became a school-girl of one school in Odessa. It was needed, that one school-boy Yuriy had to feel the love to this girl Zoya, and it succeeded. Next step was to let know for this boy that Zoya means dangerous. When the boy was looking for this girl she became smile and said roughly: [...] "What are you looking?" [...] Other boys and girl pay attention and it is shamefully for the boy. The poet and writer Alexander Pushkin verse [...] "Oleg Prophetic" [...] {{was included in the}} program of this class during that period. Personage Oleg Prophetic died due to snake bite, the snake was described by the poet as [...] "the snake under a boot tree". The word snake on Russian is [...] "змея" [...] (zmeya), pronunciation is close to Zoya. The boy Yuriy (short name Yura) was looking at the girl Zoya and he thought: [...] "A Snake under a boot tree". In 1977, and of eight class education, girls of this class gave one to another and to some school-boys own special note-books where had to be mentioned any wishes or remarks as last two classes could be completed by girls and boys, who wished to continue education in any institute, high school or academy. It was possible after completion of 10 classes education. <b>Everybody</b> <b>could</b> check what was written by others and the boy Yura sow that Zoy wrote in one note-book: [...] "The love does not exist." [...] Zoya and her parent back from Odessa to Volga region in 1977. The boy Yuriy remembered that it was just switching from the previous love to Zhoya and his love to Zoya was switched off after Zoya departure. Later he understood that behind him was family with equipment and their boy Oleg received nickname [...] "Oleg Prophetic". Seems Zoya arrived in Odessa for short time to mentioned who will stay with equipment behind Yura. Jargon [...] "Zoya" [...] is [...] "a dangerous snake" [...] was promulgated, seems to avoid anybody understand really situation. The boy Yuriy does not call any Zoya as a snake. Really the boy Oleg became a [...] "snake" [...] for Yuriy later. It is example, how new meanings of words could enter the Russian language. It is means that some jargon could enter during the Mister X filming or later. Seems all jargon of the word [...] "виноград" [...] (...) entered during the Mister X filming or later. And really, the festival's bride was a problem for KGB due to plenty questions and misunderstandings.|$|E
