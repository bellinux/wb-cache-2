25|$|The {{evolutionary}} history is finished. The endeavour is complete. If you'd asked me 20 years ago whether we'd be attempting such a mammoth task, I'd have said 'Don't be ridiculous'. These programmes tell a particular story and I'm sure others will {{come along and}} tell it much better than I did, but I do hope that if people watch it in 50 years' time, it will still <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> {{the world we live}} in.|$|E
25|$|The master {{constraint}} programme {{has evolved}} into a fully combinatorial treatment of gravity known as Algebraic Quantum Gravity (AQG). The non-graph changing master constraint operator is adapted in the framework of algebraic quantum gravity. While AQG is inspired by LQG, it differs drastically from it because in AQG there is fundamentally no topology or differential structure – it is background independent in a more generalized sense and could possibly <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> topology change. In this new formulation of quantum gravity AQG semiclassical states always control the fluctuations of all present degrees of freedom. This makes the AQG semiclassical analysis superior over that of LQG, and {{progress has been made in}} establishing it has the correct semiclassical limit and providing contact with familiar low energy physics.|$|E
500|$|This hypothesis, {{although}} not perfect, perhaps best explains the evidence. Eighteen {{months prior to}} an October 1984 conference on lunar origins, Bill Hartmann, Roger Phillips, and Jeff Taylor challenged fellow lunar scientists: [...] "You have eighteen months. Go back to your Apollo data, {{go back to your}} computer, do whatever you have to, but make up your mind. Don't come to our conference unless you <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> the Moon's birth." [...] At the 1984 conference at Kona, Hawaii, the giant impact hypothesis emerged as the most popular. Before the conference, there were partisans of the three [...] "traditional" [...] theories, plus a few people who were starting to take the giant impact seriously, and there was a huge apathetic middle who didn’t think the debate would ever be resolved. Afterward there were essentially only two groups: the giant impact camp and the agnostics.|$|E

We shall <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> religion, about politics, fashion, society, literature, the stage, the stock exchange, and the police station, and we will speak out what is in our mind as fairly, as truthfully, and as decently as we know how." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{both the}} Williams sisters entered {{the top ten}} and started meeting in tournaments, {{unsubstantiated}} rumors of match fixing started to circulate. John McEnroe, while commenting on the 2000 Wimbledon semifinal between the two sisters, said that [...] "Serena may {{not be allowed to}} win. Richard may <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> this." [...] Elena Dementieva, a fellow professional player, said during a post match interview after losing to Venus at the Indian Wells quarterfinals in 2001, that Richard Williams decided the results between the two sisters. Venus pulling out at the last minute garnered much speculation in the press, with fans demanding their money back.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{incident}} McQueen's stepfather persuaded {{his mother to}} sign a court order stating that McQueen was incorrigible, remanding him to the California Junior Boys Republic in Chino. Here, McQueen began to change and mature. He was not popular with the other boys at first: [...] "Say the boys had a chance once a month to load into a bus and go into town to see a movie. And they lost out because one guy in the bungalow didn't get his work done right. Well, you can pretty well guess they're gonna <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> that. I paid my dues with the other fellows quite a few times. I got my lumps, no doubt about it. The other guys in the bungalow had ways of paying you back for interfering with their well-being." [...] Ultimately McQueen became a role model {{when he was elected}} to the Boys Council, a group who set the rules and regulations governing the boys' lives. He eventually left the Boys Republic at age 16. When he later became famous he regularly returned to talk to the boys and retained a lifelong association.|$|E

2500|$|In early 1999, HBO {{commissioned}} {{an interview}} of Wilson by the Flaming Lips' Wayne Coyne for {{an episode of}} Reverb which never aired. Following the interview, Coyne felt that Wilson surrounded himself with yes-men, which he found [...] "off-putting at times", and that [...] "later on, I was like, 'Well, if he's such a genius, why can't he talk?' He's been asked about his music, like, everyday of his fucking life, so you'd think that he'd <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> it ... I'm not in contempt of him, though. I just hate that if someone is drug-damaged, or eccentric, or possibly mad, people will let them shit all over themselves thinking, 'Isn't he cool?'." [...] In 2014, fans reacted negatively to the announcement that Wilson was to record a duets album, titled No Pier Pressure, and called it a [...] "cash-in". A Facebook post attributed to Wilson responded to the feedback: [...] "In my life in music, I’ve been told too many times not to fuck with the formula, but as an artist it’s my job to do that." [...] The album received mixed or average reviews.|$|E

Kenge and Carboy will <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> it; Master Somebody--a sort of ridiculous sexton, digging graves for {{the merits of}} causes in a back room {{at the end of}} Quality Court, Chancery Lane--will <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> it; counsel will <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> it; the Chancellor will <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> it; the {{satellites}} will <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> it; they will all have to be handsomely feed, all round, about it; the whole thing will be vastly ceremonious, wordy, unsatisfactory, and expensive, and I call it, in general, wiglomeration. How mankind ever came to be afflicted with wiglomeration, or for whose sins these young people ever fell into a pit of it, I don't know; so it is." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But {{you must}} <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> it, mamma. You must bring {{yourself}} {{to have something}} to say,--to have a great deal to say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Better go slow," [...] urged {{one of his}} friends. [...] "That chap {{looks to}} me like one of the old guard. He may <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> your doings with his daughter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you bring}} me before the court I'll <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> your underhanded work with Ivan Snokoff. I can prove {{that he is a}} swindler and that you are his accomplice." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I wouldn't {{like to say}} {{anything}} about that, Professor," [...] he answered slowly. [...] "I might be accusing a fellow cadet unfairly. If the suitcase isn't returned by to-morrow I may <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come {{round to}} the other side of the carriage, Herbert," [...] she said. [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you. The coachman does not {{understand}} English. I have tried him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, you!" [...] {{the doctor}} burst out. [...] "He begged me--his enemy, as he thinks--to bring you {{to him at}} once. It seems he <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is one {{advantage}} about this horrid place," [...] he said; [...] "we have {{got it all}} to ourselves. Stay where you are, Betteredge; I <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you." ...|$|R
