50|$|The New Zealand {{storm petrel}} {{is a small}} seabird, dark brown/black above, except for its white rump. The underparts are black from the throat to the breast, with a white belly that has black streaking, and the feet project well beyond the tail. This storm petrel is {{strictly}} nocturnal at the breeding sites to avoid predation by gulls and skuas. Like most petrels, its walking ability {{is limited to a}} short shuffle to the burrow. It differs from the more common petrel species found in New Zealand, Wilson's storm petrel (O. oceanicus), by its pale bar on the upper wing, white belly with streaking, narrow white panel on the underwings, longer legs, and <b>dark</b> <b>webs</b> to the feet. Outside the breeding season it is pelagic, remaining at sea, and this, together with its remote breeding sites, makes it a difficult bird to observe.|$|R
500|$|As of August 17, The Daily Stormer had {{returned}} to the <b>dark</b> <b>web</b> on the Tor network.

[...] The next day Stormfront's domain name was seized by Network Solutions, enforcing terms of service against [...] "bigotry, discrimination or hatred".

500|$|On August 13, {{the website}} was {{informed}} by its domain registrar GoDaddy {{that it had}} violated the terms of service by mocking Heyer, and Anglin was given 24 hours to locate a new registrar for the site.

6000|$|There is, indeed, no {{intrinsic}} cause why the ecclesiastical, or pseudo-Catholic, view {{of history}} should, in any wise, conduce to a just appreciation of our forefathers. For not only did our forefathers rebel against that conception again and again, till they finally trampled it under their feet, and so appear, prima facie, as offenders to be judged at its bar; but the conception itself is one which takes the very same view of nature as that cynic conception of which we spoke above. Man, with the Romish divines, is, ipso facto, the same being as the man of Voltaire, Le Sage, or Beaumarchais; he is an insane and degraded being, who is {{to be kept in}} order, and, as far as may be, cured and set to work by an ecclesiastical system; and the only threads of light in the <b>dark</b> <b>web</b> of his history are clerical and theurgic, not lay and human. Voltaire is the very experimentum crucis of this ugly fact. European history looks to him what it would have looked to his Jesuit preceptors, had the sacerdotal element in it been wanting; what heathen history actually did look to them. He eliminates the sacerdotal element, and nothing remains but the chaos of apes and wolves which the Jesuits had taught him to believe was the original substratum of society. The humanity of his history--even of his 'Pucelle d'Orleans,--is simply the humanity of Sanchez and the rest of those vingtquatre Peres who hang gibbeted for ever in the pages of Pascal. He is superior to his teachers, certainly, in this, that he has hope for humanity on earth; dreams of a new and nobler life for society, by means of a true and scientific knowledge of the laws of the moral and material universe; in a word, he has, {{in the midst of all}} his filth and his atheism, a faith in a righteous and truth-revealing God, which the priests who brought him up had not. Let the truth be spoken, even though in favour of such a destroying Azrael as Voltaire. And what if his primary conception of humanity be utterly base? Is that of our modern historians so much higher? Do Christian men seem to them, on the whole, in all ages, to have had the spirit of God with them, leading them into truth, however imperfectly and confusedly they may have learnt his lessons? ...|$|E

40|$|Understanding of the {{observed}} structure in the universe can be reached only in the theoretical framework of dark matter. N-body simulations are indispensable {{for the analysis of}} the formation and evolution of the <b>dark</b> matter <b>web.</b> Two primary fields - density and velocity fields - are used in most of studies. However dark matter provides two additional fields which are unique for collisionless media only. These are the multi- stream field in Eulerian space and flip-flop field in Lagrangian space. The flip-flop field represents the number of sign reversals of an elementary volume of each collisionless fluid element. This field can be estimated by counting the sign reversals of the Jacobian at each particle at every time step of the simulation. The Jacobian is evaluated by numerical differentiation of the Lagrangian submanifold, i. e., the three-dimensional dark matter sheet in the six-dimensional space formed by three Lagrangian and three Eulerian coordinates. We present the results of the statistical study of the evolution of the flip-flop field from z = 50 to the present time z = 0. A number of statistical characteristics show that the pattern of the flip-flop field remains remarkably stable from z = 30 to the present time. As a result the flip-flop field evaluated at z = 0 stores a wealth of information about the dynamical history of the <b>dark</b> matter <b>web.</b> In particular one of the most intriguing properties of the flip-flop is a unique capability to preserve the information about the merging history of dark matter haloes.
