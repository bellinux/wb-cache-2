500|$|Before Touraj Moghaddam founded Roksan, he {{had become}} {{dissatisfied}} {{with the state of}} the audio arts when he heard his little television set reproduce Thelonious Monk in a more musically satisfying way than his high-end Linn/Naim tri-amped audio system. Through experimentation, he deduced that the existing turntable design failed because the cartridge was not being held still wherever the groove went. He believed that the mean line traced by the groove relative to the body of the cartridge needed to be constant. His ideas led him away from using the sprung sub-chassis as part of the speed-controlling system. Needing a top plinth roughly an inch (25mm) thick made from wood with a density of about 700 to 800kg/m3, Moghaddam found suitable material in a fire door with which he built a prototype. His friend Tufan Hashemi – then an <b>investment</b> <b>analyst</b> – heard the new prototype turntable and wanted one. They agreed to team up to start production; Roksan Audio was formed. The Xerxes, introduced in 1985, secured the advocacy of Roger Macer, a successful independent hi-fi retailer in London who sold the then market leader, the Linn Sondek. Hashemi credits Macer with urging him to start satisfying the demand of [...] "dozens or more a week" [...] from his customers. The product, named after the Persian king Xerxes I, was launched at a hi-fi show in 1985 where the Roksan Darius loudspeaker concept was also unveiled.|$|E

To be a good <b>investment</b> <b>analyst,</b> one needs to be an expert economist also." [...] In 1932 he enrolled at Harvard for a Ph.D. in economics, with the hopes of learning what had caused the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the subsequent economic depression of the 1930s. For his thesis, Joseph Schumpeter suggested the question of the intrinsic value of a common stock, for which Williams' personal experience and background would serve him in good stead. He received his doctorate in 1940.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This {{research}} study {{aims to examine}} how differences in opinions on the material weaknesses identified in the auditor's assessment of the financial statements, and the auditor's assessment of internal control affect investment analysts' assessment of the financial strength {{of the company and}} willingness to recommend the stock for purchase to clients. It also aims to examine how the auditor's opinion on management's assessment of internal control affects investment analysts' assessment, providing additional evidence of the appropriateness of the elimination of this requirement under Auditing Standard No. 5. Design/methodology/approach – The paper examines these research questions using data from a laboratory experiment with <b>investment</b> <b>analysts</b> as participants in the study. Findings – The findings indicate that adverse audit opinions on the effectiveness of internal control result in <b>investment</b> <b>analysts</b> making a higher assessment of company risk, a lower assessment of the strength of internal control over financial reporting, and a marginally significant difference in the likelihood of recommending stock to their client. Research limitations/implications – These findings provide evidence that auditors' assessment of internal control risk provides information to <b>investment</b> <b>analysts.</b> Originality/value – This study contributes to the literature by examining the implications of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act on the judgment of users of financial statements.
