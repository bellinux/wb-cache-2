50|$|The {{interior}} {{design of the}} building {{is a tribute to}} detail. The design of each lamp, piece of <b>furniture,</b> <b>panel,</b> flooring material and decorative board reflects the mature approach resulting from Aalto’s long career as an architect. All the materials speak the language of nature, simply without technically artificial tones. This is because Aalto’s basic view was that architecture should create a frame for human beings. In the Finlandia Hall, the focus is not on extraordinary forms or ostentatious interior. It is on the audience and on the performers. According to Aalto, the audience at the Finlandia Hall need not dress up like people used to in the opera foyers and gilded concert halls of the old days. What people wear should be as genuine and natural as the environment in the building.|$|E
50|$|These ratings {{describe}} how much sound is NOT reflected from a surface, such as ceiling or <b>furniture</b> <b>panels.</b> They vary from 0 (complete reflection) to 1 (no reflection). The higher the rating, the less the reflected sound. They do NOT express {{the reduction in}} sound level and do NOT relate specifically to speech.Noise Reduction Coefficient (NRC) {{is not necessarily a}} measure of how much sound is converted to heat. It is actually a measure of how much sound is NOT reflected. Misinterpretation of this difference has resulted in <b>furniture</b> <b>panels</b> that are completely fiberglass with extremely high NRC ratings. Unfortunately, speech is not absorbed but passes through the panel to the person in the next workstation, with disastrous privacy. Sound Absorption Average (SAA) is an updated version of NRC.|$|R

As far as there is no standard regulating the structure and properties of differently coated construction panels, it is important to study the bending strength of panel details on the type and thickness of the coating material. The obtained results allow to ascertain rational type, structure and thickness of the coating material for panels (produced from the most often used for furniture manufacture 18 mm thick particleboard). Particleboard <b>furniture</b> <b>panels</b> were coated using paper-based film, compensatory paper, laminated plastics, 0. 6 mm thick mahogany veneer (1 to 8 outer layers) and coated with acrylic paint.

50|$|Masking {{speakers}} {{have been}} {{mounted on the}} tops of panels for a number of years. Most were associated with Herman Miller furniture systems. Early versions had a spherical ball with an upward facing speaker mounted in it. The ball was placed on top of a short rod which was connected {{to the top of a}} <b>furniture</b> <b>panel.</b> The sound radiated upward and reflected from the ceiling tile. Each masker had volume and spectrum controls that were accessible to persons on either side of the panel. Since most open offices had many panels, proper spacing of the masking was not a problem. The effectiveness of the masking was somewhat determined by the sound absorption characteristics of the ceiling tile. This masker was later replaced by the maker shown in the figure on the right; control of the level and spectrum was centralized.|$|E
50|$|TL is the {{transmission}} loss in decibels, MS and BS are respectively masking and ambient sound levels in decibels. The speech weighting factors W are those listed with Articulation Index. The first two ratings {{account for the}} high sound loss at frequencies that are important for intelligibility. ESL treats {{the difference between the}} masking spectrum and the background spectrum as an additional loss. The figure on the right shows the Speech Loss for a <b>furniture</b> <b>panel</b> with high STC; it is the excess loss caused by sound diffraction over the panel. The Effective Speech Loss is higher and shows sound masking as if it were part of the partition. The masking level for this example was set at 47 dB(A) and the background level was 39 dB(A). This graph demonstrates the significant value of sound masking when it acts as an additional panel height. It is clear that the level used in the graph only would be necessary for low panel heights, but is excessive with higher panels. The graph also demonstrates the panel tradeoff with sound masking. Adding masking permits lower panels to achieve the same speech loss. Adding masking roughly permits a reduction of at least 12 inches in panel height so there can be a significant cost savings.The reflection of speech from a ceiling in an open office depends on the sound absorbing characteristics of the ceiling tile and the height of the suspended ceiling. Because ceiling tiles tend to absorb the higher frequencies better, the speech loss is relatively good, as seen in the figure on the right. It should be noted that an upgrade in NRC rating adds expense but not always appreciable speech privacy improvement. A goal of SL=20 for the ceiling would require the panel height to be at least 60-66 inches to balance the two paths with added masking, otherwise, the panel would be the weakest sound path. Higher ceilings also increase sound diffusion for masking speakers in the ceiling plenum, increasing acceptability.|$|E

In this paper, we study the feasibility of inductive wireless power transfer with the most common used table top materials and coatings. We install the transmitter coil beneath the furniture surface so the wireless charger module remains invisible.

40|$|Sheet metal bending is {{a process}} in which bends are formed using a {{combination}} of a punch and a die. A very large number of mechanical products such as <b>furniture</b> <b>panels,</b> shelves, cabinets, housing for electro-mechanical devices, etc. are created by using the sheet metal bending process. Bending tools need to satisfy the following two criteria: (1) tools should be able to withstand bending forces, and (2) tool shapes should be such that there is no tool-part interference. In this paper, we describe a methodology for automatically designing shapes of bending punches for bending multiple parts in a single setup. We create parametric geometric models of punches. These parametric models describe the family of possible punch shapes. Using the part geometry and parametric punch shape models, we automatically generated constraints on tool parameters that eliminate the possibility of part-tool interference. We use mixed-integer techniques to identify parameters of punch shapes that result in the maximum punch strength. Finally, we perform strength analysis of the designed punch shape using "nite element analysis methods, to verify that the designed punch shape is capable of withstanding the bending forces. � 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|To {{make the}} {{development}} process for new laminated wood products more effective, there is need for a simulation tool based on {{a model of the}} wood material. With help from this tool the risk of fractures in the veneers, cracking in the wood or in the glue line will be estimated. Wood is a complex hygroscopic material that is highly anisotropic, non-homogeneous, and strongly dependent on the loading rate. Most importantly, it is very sensitive for changes in temperature and moisture content. The material stiffness in the transversal directions is very low for wood and it is highly affected by changes in environmental conditions. During a manufacturing procedure of veneered products for curved <b>furniture</b> <b>panels,</b> the veneers are exposed to large membrane and bending deformations and high pressure in the radial fibre direction. When hot-press forming is used, the products are also exposed to high temperature on their surface. These hard conditions often result in large viscoelastic and elasto-plastic strains that have strong influence on the final quality of the product (spring-back, stiffness, distortion etc). To be able to improve the manufacturing process the key issue is to understand the material behaviour during these severe conditions. The main scientific challenge is to establish a new thermal and moisture related elasto-plastic material model for non-linear and strongly orthotropic wood material behaviour. Based on this work a FE-model for analysing the whole forming procedure of the bended and laminated wood products is presented...|$|R
