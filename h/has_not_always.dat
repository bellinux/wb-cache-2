5|$|In {{recent times}} ubiquity <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> been understoodâ€”not even by Sir Boyle Roche, for example, who {{held that a}} man cannot be in two places at once unless he is a bird.|$|E
5|$|All rock now {{exposed in}} the area of the park is volcanic, but this <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> been the case. For {{hundreds}} of millions of years, the Lassen region underwent repeated uplifting to form mountains, only to have them worn down and submerged under encroaching seas. During the periods of submersion, sand, mud and limestone were deposited. Occasionally volcanic activity was associated with the mountain building.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{majority}} of the restaurant locations are privately held by individual owners and its financial dependence on those owners, Burger King's relationship with its franchises <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> been harmonious. Occasional disagreements between the two have caused numerous issues, and in several instances the company's and its licensees' relations have degenerated into precedent-setting court cases.|$|E

Then, perhaps taking Violet's bewildered looks for reluctance, 'I am afraid, my dear, I <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> been as affectionate as you deserved, and <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> tried to make you comfortable.' ...|$|R

5|$|The Eurasian {{tree sparrow}} has been {{introduced}} outside its native range, but <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> become established, possibly due to competition with the house sparrow. It was introduced successfully to Sardinia, eastern Indonesia, the Philippines and Micronesia, but introductions to New Zealand and Bermuda did not take root. Ship-carried birds colonised Borneo. This sparrow has occurred as a natural vagrant to Gibraltar, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Israel, and Dubai.|$|E
5|$|Relationships with {{tribes to}} retain Native {{names have been}} {{established}} {{at the high school}} level. Arapahoe High School (Centennial, Colorado) now uses a logo provided by the Arapaho Tribe of Wyoming, which initially included an agreement that the image would not be placed on the gym floor or any article of clothing. The latter provision <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> been observed, but the logo does not appear on the team uniforms. The agreement also includes tribal participation in school events.|$|E
5|$|Some navies operate ocean-going {{hospital}} {{ships to}} lend medical assistance in high casualty situations like wars or natural disasters. These hospital ships fulfill {{the criteria of}} an ambulance (transporting the sick or injured), although the capabilities of a hospital ship are more on par with a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital. In line with the laws of war, these ships can display a prominent Red Cross or Red Crescent to confer protection under the appropriate Geneva convention. However, this designation <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> protected hospital ships from enemy fire.|$|E

5|$|Sri Lankan Tamil {{nationalism}} is {{the conviction of}} the Sri Lankan Tamil people, a minority ethnic group in the South Asian island country of Sri Lanka (formerly known as Ceylon), {{that they have the}} right to constitute an independent or autonomous political community. This idea <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> existed. Sri Lankan Tamil national awareness began during the era of British rule during the nineteenth century, as Tamil Hindu revivalists tried to counter Protestant missionary activity. The revivalists, led by Arumuga Navalar, used literacy as a tool to spread Hinduism and its principles.|$|E
5|$|The Parliament has 20 Standing Committees {{consisting}} of 25 to 71 MEPs each (reflecting the political make-up {{of the whole}} Parliament) including a chair, a bureau and secretariat. They meet twice a month in public to draw up, amend to adopt legislative proposals and reports to {{be presented to the}} plenary. The rapporteurs for a committee are supposed to present the view of the committee, although notably this <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> been the case. In the events leading to the resignation of the Santer Commission, the rapporteur went against the Budgetary Control Committee's narrow vote to discharge the budget, and urged the Parliament to reject it.|$|E
5|$|The {{mouth of}} the river <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> been at Littlehampton. Until the later fifteenth century it joined the River Adur at Lancing some ten {{miles to the east}} before {{entering}} the sea. This estuary became blocked with shingle by the eastward drift of the tides, pushing the Adur towards Shoreham-by-Sea, while the Arun broke out at Worthing, Goring and Ferring at various times, until it formed its present estuary at Littlehampton between 1500 and 1530.|$|E

5|$|Ambulances {{may also}} carry an emblem (either {{as part of}} the passive warning {{markings}} or not), such as a Red Cross, Red Crescent or Red Crystal (collective known as the Protective Symbols). These are symbols laid down by the Geneva Convention, and all countries signatory to it agree to restrict their use to either (1) Military Ambulances or (2) the national Red Cross or Red Crescent society. Use by any other person, organization or agency is in breach of international law. The protective symbols are designed to indicate to all people (especially combatants in the case of war) that the vehicle is neutral and is not to be fired upon, hence giving protection to the medics and their casualties, although this <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> been adhered to. In Israel, Magen David Adom, the Red Cross member organization use a red Star of David, but this does not have recognition beyond Israeli borders, where they must use the Red Crystal.|$|E
5|$|Following most {{present day}} {{damaging}} earthquakes, teams of investigators from {{institutions such as}} the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute are sent to the affected region to set up instruments to capture strong motion records, and to study the damage and other effects of the event. This <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> been the case, and the 1954 report from Steinbrugge and Moran that thoroughly detailed the effects (especially to buildings) of the 1952 shocks put in place a model for how modern earthquake reconnaissance reports are written. The strong motion record that was obtained from the 1952 shock, as well as the accelerogram from the 1940 El Centro earthquake, were the most widely used data sets until the 1971 San Fernando earthquake.|$|E
5|$|For much of Arsenal's history, {{their home}} colours have been bright red shirts with white sleeves and white shorts, though this <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> been the case. The choice of red is in {{recognition}} of a charitable donation from Nottingham Forest, soon after Arsenal's foundation in 1886. Two of Dial Square's founding members, Fred Beardsley and Morris Bates, were former Forest players who had moved to Woolwich for work. As they put together the first team in the area, no kit could be found, so Beardsley and Bates wrote home for help and received a set of kit and a ball. The shirt was redcurrant, a dark shade of red, and was worn with white shorts and socks with blue and white hoops.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the first}} details noted about Iguanodon was that it had the teeth of a herbivorous reptile, {{although}} there <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> been consensus on how it ate. As Mantell noted, the remains {{he was working with}} were unlike any modern reptile, especially in the toothless, scoop-shaped form of the lower jaw symphysis, which he found best compared to that of the two-toed sloth and the extinct ground sloth Mylodon. He also suggested that Iguanodon had a prehensile tongue which could be used to gather food, like a giraffe. More complete remains have shown this to be an error; for example, the hyoid bones that supported the tongue are heavily built, implying a muscular, non-prehensile tongue used for moving food around in the mouth. The giraffe-tongue idea has also been incorrectly attributed to Dollo via a broken lower jaw.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{video game}} {{developer}} and publisher Square Enix (formally two companies called Square and Enix prior to 2003) has been translating its games for North America {{since the late}} 1980s, and the PAL region and Asia since the late 1990s. It <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> released all of its games in all major regions, and continues to selectively release games even today depending on multiple {{factors such as the}} viability of platforms or the condition of the game itself. The process of localization has changed during that time from having a one-person team with a short time and tight memory capacities to having a team of translators preparing simultaneous launches in multiple languages.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} traditions {{associated}} with the Stanley Cup. One of the oldest, started by the 1896 Winnipeg Victorias, dictates that the winning team drink champagne from the top bowl after their victory. The Cup is also traditionally presented on the ice to {{the captain of the}} winning team after the series-winning game; each member of the victorious club carries the trophy around the rink. However, this <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> been the case; prior to the 1930s, the Cup was not awarded immediately after the victory. The first time that the Cup was awarded on the ice may have been to the 1932 Toronto Maple Leafs, but the practice did not become a tradition until the 1950s. Ted Lindsay of the 1950Cup champion Detroit Red Wings became the first captain, upon receiving the Cup, to hoist it overhead and skate around the rink. According to Lindsay, he did so to allow the fans to have a better view of the Cup. Since then, it has been a tradition for each member of the winning team, beginning with the captain, to take a lap around the ice with the trophy hoisted above his head.|$|E

25|$|History <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> {{been kind}} to the chapel. The RCHM's 1916 survey, An Inventory of the Historical Monuments in Essex, records it as desecrated and in use as a stable, {{although}} it does describe its condition as fairly good.|$|E
25|$|A {{multitude}} of analogies, similarities or parallels {{have been drawn}} over the decades between modern science and Cubism. But there <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> been agreement {{as to how the}} writings of Metzinger and Gleizes should be interpreted, with respect to 'simultaneity' of multiple view-points.|$|E
25|$|Plane travel makes Mecca and the Hajj more {{accessible}} to pilgrims {{from all over the}} world. As a consequence, the Hajj has become increasingly crowded.
