5|$|At the beginning, <b>jumping</b> <b>on</b> every cube once {{is enough}} to advance. In later stages, each cube must be hit twice to reach the target color. Other times, cubes change color every time Q*bert lands on them, instead of {{remaining}} on the target color once they reach it. Both elements are then combined in subsequent stages. Jumping off the pyramid results in the character's death.|$|E
50|$|The <b>jump</b> <b>on</b> line 50 {{will always}} be taken if the <b>jump</b> <b>on</b> line 20 is taken. Therefore the <b>jump</b> <b>on</b> line 20 may safely be {{modified}} to jump directly to line 100.|$|R

5|$|Bermuda sent a {{delegation}} {{to compete at}} the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. The games marked Bermuda's twenty-first Olympic appearance since its debut in 1936. The 2008 delegation included six athletes: Tyrone Smith and Arantxa King in long jump, Jillian Terceira in individual <b>jumping</b> <b>on</b> horseback, Kiera Aitken and Roy-Allan Burch in swimming (Aitken in backstroke, and Burch in freestyle), and Flora Duffy in triathlon.

5|$|Scattered {{throughout}} {{each level}} are {{various types of}} crates, most of which contain items such as Wumpa Fruit and Aku Aku masks, {{which can be broken}} by <b>jumping</b> <b>on</b> or spinning into them. Other types of crate include checkpoint crates, which lets players resume their progress after losing a life, arrow crates which Crash can bounce on, and explosive TNT crates that explode upon being broken, or following a timer that activates by <b>jumping</b> <b>on</b> them. Certain crates, including steel platform crates, are invisible, requiring the player to hit an exclamation box to make them tangible. If the player clears a level with all crates broken without dying, they will earn a gem. Additional gems can be obtained through hidden levels or alternate routes, and some gems are required to access new areas. Collecting all gems in the game allows the player to reach its true ending. If the player manages to collect enough bonus icons, they will be warped to a Bonus Stage which, upon completion, will allow the player to save their progress, either via memory card or password.|$|E

5000|$|Also {{supported}} {{are several}} conditional jumps, including [...] (<b>jump</b> <b>on</b> zero), [...] (<b>jump</b> <b>on</b> non-zero), [...] (<b>jump</b> <b>on</b> greater than, signed), [...] (<b>jump</b> <b>on</b> less than, signed), [...] (<b>jump</b> <b>on</b> above/greater than, unsigned), [...] (<b>jump</b> <b>on</b> below/less than, unsigned). These conditional operations {{are based on}} the state of specific bits in the (E)FLAGS register. Many arithmetic and logic operations set, clear or complement these flags depending on their result. The comparison [...] (compare) and [...] instructions set the flags as if they had performed a subtraction or a bitwise AND operation, respectively, without altering the values of the operands. There are also instructions such as [...] (clear carry flag) and [...] (complement carry flag) which work on the flags directly. Floating point comparisons are performed via [...] or [...] instructions which eventually have to be converted to integer flags.|$|R

5|$|The Calais migrant crisis led to {{escalating}} {{tension between}} the UK and France {{in the summer of}} 2015. The UK blamed France for not doing enough to stop migrants from entering the tunnel or making attempts to scale fences built along the border. The British Prime Minister David Cameron released a statement saying that illegal immigrants would be removed from the UK even if they reached the island. To discourage migrants and refugees from <b>jumping</b> <b>on</b> train shuttles at Calais, the UK government supplied fencing to be installed in the Eurotunnel where the vehicles are loaded onto train shuttles in Calais.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{multiplayer}} mode pits {{two players}} {{against each other}} as they play as Mario and Luigi in one of five stages, trying {{to be the first to}} obtain a preset number of stars. Both players can attack each other in attempts to steal the other player's stars. <b>Jumping</b> <b>on</b> the opponent's character will make them lose one star, while performing a ground pound will lose them three. In addition, some minigames previously available in Super Mario 64 DS have returned and now offer multiplayer options for added replay value. The minigames are divided into the categories Action, Puzzle, Table and Variety. New Super Mario Bros. contains eighteen minigames for single players and ten minigames for multiple players.|$|E

The SEALs fired four shots at bin Laden; the first missed, the second grazed Amal in the calf also missing bin Laden, and the final two hit bin Laden in the chest and head, killing him instantly. In Pfarrer's account, the total time elapsed from <b>jumping</b> <b>on</b> the roof to Osama bin Laden's death was between 30 and 90 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg), Ensign Ro Laren (Michelle Forbes) and Keiko O'Brien (Rosalind Chao) are {{returning}} to the Enterprise from the planet Marlonia, but a transporter accident results in them changing into 12-year-old children. Although the four still retain an adult mind, the crew have trouble taking them seriously, and Picard (David Tristan Birkin) is convinced by Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) to temporarily relinquish command of the ship. After turning over command of the Enterprise to Commander William Riker, Picard ponders resigning his Starfleet commission, albeit temporarily, in order to pursue other interests. Meanwhile, Keiko (Caroline Junko King) is dismayed by her husband Miles's (Colm Meaney) reluctance {{to be with her}} and is further saddened her daughter (Hana Hatae) does not recognize her.

5|$|Crash Bandicoot is a {{platform}} {{game in which}} players control the titular protagonist, Crash, as he traverses several levels in sequence in order to progress. Crash is able to defeat enemies by either <b>jumping</b> <b>on</b> them or using a spinning attack that launches them. Crash will lose a life if he is hit by an enemy or obstacle, or falls into a bottomless pit. Crash can protect himself by collecting Aku Aku masks, which protect Crash from a single hit from an enemy or obstacle (but not pits or other instant-death obstacles). Crash can hold onto two masks at a time and, upon collecting a third mask, will gain temporary invincibility. The game ends when the player runs out of lives, with more lives earned by finding extra life items or by collecting 100 Wumpa Fruit.|$|E
5|$|In the ponerine ant Harpegnathos saltator, worker {{policing}} {{prevents the}} number of reproductive workers from becoming excessive. The species has gamergates, which lay eggs but rarely carry out any other tasks, so having {{too many of them}} would reduce the colony's efficiency. Gamergate numbers are rather stable, as infertile workers target newly ovipositing workers by <b>jumping</b> <b>on</b> and holding them: this efficiently inhibits them from laying eggs, and within a few weeks they revert to being subordinate and infertile workers. However, once new ovipositing workers attain a gamergate's level of ovarian activity, the infertile (policing) workers ignore them. The signal used by the policing workers consists of cuticle hydrocarbons transmitted only by direct contact, rather than being a pheromone detected by olfaction. Similarly, the inhibition of ovipositing workers is achieved by direct physical aggression by policing workers, not by any pheromone produced by queens or gamergates.|$|E
5|$|Several {{video game}} sequels were {{released}} over the years, {{but did not}} reach {{the same level of}} success as the original. The first, titled Q*bert's Qubes, shows a copyright for 1983 on its title screen, whereas the instruction manual cites a 1984 copyright. It was manufactured by Mylstar Electronics, and uses the same hardware as the original. The game features Q*bert, but introduces new enemies: Meltniks, Shoobops, and Rat-A-Tat-Tat. The player navigates the protagonist around a plane of cubes while avoiding enemies. <b>Jumping</b> <b>on</b> a cube causes it to rotate, changing the color of the visible sides of the cube. The goal is to match a line of cubes to a target sample; later levels require multiple rows to match. Despite the popularity of the franchise, the game's release was hardly noticed. Parker Brothers showcased home versions of Q*bert's Qubes at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show in January 1985. Q*bert's Qubes was ported to the Colecovision and Atari 2600.|$|E

5|$|The NWA World Tag Team Championship was {{defended by}} AMW, who were {{accompanied}} by Gail Kim, against The Naturals in the sixth bout on the card. The duration of the contest was 10 minutes and 37 seconds. Douglas' head was busted open during the match, causing him to bleed from the forehead throughout. The Naturals got a two-count on Harris after they performed AMW's signature Death Sentence maneuver on him by slamming him back-first into the mat while <b>jumping</b> <b>on</b> his throat. Kim interfered in the bout by distracting The Naturals, which allowed Storm to bash Douglas over the head and then handcuff him to the ring-barrier. AMW followed by performing the Death Sentence on Stevens and pinning him to remain champions.|$|E
5|$|Each level {{contains}} various {{obstacles and}} enemies {{that the players}} must deal with. Players lose a segment from their snake if they are hit by an enemy, and they lose a life if their snake runs out of segments. Players can also lose a life if their snakes fall too far, the timer runs out, their snakes touch a sharp object, or if they are squashed by an object from above. Also, if they remain in some bodies of water for too long, a shark will attack. The game ends if players lose all their lives, but they have several continues {{in which they can}} restart the game from where they left off. Players can defeat enemies by hitting them with their tongues or by <b>jumping</b> <b>on</b> them. They can collect various items to help them along during gameplay, such as items that extend the length of the snakes' tongues, extra lives and continues, time bonuses, invisibility diamonds, and items that speed up or reverse the direction of the snakes. Located throughout the game are lids (in the shape of manhole covers) in which players can open to uncover Nibbly Pibbleys, items and extra lives, entrances to bonus levels, and sometimes enemies. Also located in the game are hidden warps which allow players to skip several levels and restart at a later point in the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{game is a}} 2D side-scrolling {{platformer}} {{in which}} the player controls either Diddy Kong or his girlfriend Dixie Kong through 52 varying levels over eight different worlds. The main objective {{of the game is}} to rescue Donkey Kong from King K. Rool. The game features a wide amount of enemies, which include land-based reptilian Kremlings, rats, bees and vultures. Enemies in underwater sections include pufferfish, eels and sharks. Each world culminates with a boss fight, which is required to be defeated in order to progress through that world. Similar to its predecessor, the player-characters may neutralise most hostiles by <b>jumping</b> <b>on</b> their heads, cartwheeling through them, or throwing a barrel at them. When hit by an enemy, the active character leaves the screen, thus control will immediately switch to the other character. The player can reclaim their partner from marked DK barrels throughout the game. If both characters die, the player will lose a life and will restart from the last checkpoint, which come in the form as a star-painted barrel. If the player loses all of their lives, the game will end.|$|E
