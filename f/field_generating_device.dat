Cancer therapies such as chemo therapy, has some side effects that can not be underestimated. Electric field with a frequency of 150 KHz- 300 KHz capable of destroying cancer cells without any biological effects that are so meaningful. Trends in the patient after being diagnosed with cancer is loss of control, depression and despair. So the psychological condition of the patient should also get special treatment because of poor emotional state will affect the diet and lifestyle of the patient. Sound is a stimulant of the brain waves. Sound can deliver patients to the condition of the alpha and theta brain waves. Alpha and theta brainwaves can eliminate stress, improve morale and life expectancy of patients, improve the body 2 ̆ 7 s immune and self-healing from within. So we need to design an electric <b>field</b> <b>generating</b> <b>device</b> to destroy cancer cells that is integrated with the brain waves stimulant.

Results of numerical and experimental characterization indicate quite good efficiency values, with acceptable homogeneity of the dose.

40|$|Continuous {{efforts are}} being made for {{alternative}} power generation techniques for use in devices with sub-micron-scale dimensions. In this work, we have perused through some of these efforts, focusing mainly on devices using materials with piezoelectric properties. In {{the last decade or}} so, nanostructured zinc oxide (ZnO) has drawn worldwide attention for its pathbreaking properties. One of its most extensively-studied properties is its ability to generate power when subjected to mechanical vibration. It can generate a potential within a wide range of frequency vibrations, from a few Hz to thousands of KHz. This can lead to extensive application prospects in many important <b>fields,</b> like self-power <b>generating</b> <b>devices</b> for medical applications, wireless technologies and various sensors, etc. This review looks into reports related to such technology in detail.

40|$|We are {{continuously}} {{exposed to}} electromagnetic (EM) <b>fields</b> <b>generated</b> by electronic <b>devices</b> such as cell phones. The effects on human bodies by EM waves, especially {{ones with the}} frequency range between 3 kHz and 300 GHz, called radiofrequency (RF), are of great interest. Reported effects of RF fields on living systems are widely variable; harmful, negligible, or nil. Although no definitive evidence has been found, it is generally considered that exposure to low energy RF waves could be a risk to human health. However, some beneficial effects were also reported. The project I joined is to elucidate the underlying mechanism {{of the effects of}} the EM fields to the neurons. I originally attempted to work on a part of the top-down approach; how the generated EM waves near the head penetrate the skull, how the network of the neurons are stimulated (extracellular stimulus), and then if the action potentials occur in each of the neurons. This approach was, however, very difficult, so I worked on a part of the bottom-up approach instead; I explored by simulation what kind of intracellular stimulus would be the most efficient to generate action potentials on a single neuron...|$|R
