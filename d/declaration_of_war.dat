5|$|At the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> on Britain by {{the newly}} formed French Republic on 1 February 1793, British forces in the Indian Ocean held a {{considerably}} stronger military position, which was immediately utilised to seize the French territories in India. The remaining French forces continued operating from their base on the remote island of Île de France, privateers in particular conducting a highly disruptive campaign against British commerce. Attempts by the Royal Navy, commanded by Rear-Admiral Peter Rainier, to limit their effectiveness resulted {{in a number of}} inconsequential clashes and a partial blockade of the French islands.

5|$|Britain's <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> against Nazi Germany in September 1939 {{included}} the Crown colonies and India {{but did not}} automatically commit the Dominions of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Newfoundland and South Africa.

5|$|On 3 September 1939, Britain {{declared}} war when its ultimatum for Germany {{to withdraw from}} Poland expired. Because the Statute of Westminster {{had not yet been}} ratified by the Australian parliament, any <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> by the UK applied to Australia by default. In some other Commonwealth Dominions, such as South Africa and Canada, there were intense parliamentary debates before the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> was accepted. Australian Prime Minister Robert Menzies asked the British government to notify Germany that Australia was an associate of the United Kingdom. Menzies' support for the war was based on the notion of an imperial defence system, upon which he believed Australia relied and which would be destroyed if the UK was defeated. This position was generally accepted by the Australian public, although there was little enthusiasm for war.|$|E
