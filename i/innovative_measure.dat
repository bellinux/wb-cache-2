40|$|Since the 1970 s, {{the governments}} in many {{countries}} including China have begun to implement systematic environmental policies aimed at curtailing industrial pollution. During the past three decades, the traditional environmental policies have evolved from simple directives regarding emission limitations into comprehensive packages using various market-based economic instruments, such as taxes and emissions trading. However, with the environmental degradation {{becoming more and more}} serious, these traditional approaches have become inadequate. Several <b>innovative</b> <b>measures,</b> including voluntary action, collaborations between stakeholders, and dissemination of information regarding industry behavior, have emerged in recent years {{in many countries}}. This study explores how these three <b>innovative</b> <b>measures</b> have been implemented in China. The thesis focuses on how these measures have encouraged private corporations in China to improve their environmental practices. Three case studies are conducted to show how these three policies work to overcome the inefficiencies of the traditional policy approaches. (cont.) This study also examines the limitations inherent in these measures. Corporate collaborations with environmental non-governmental organizations, the International Standards Organization 14000 -an environmental management systems certificate program- and the China Environmental Labeling Program, are studied in detail to provide examples of the limitations and what they imply for the future. This study finds that the inherent demands have motivated these enterprises to adopt the <b>innovative</b> <b>measures</b> are different. At the same time, these measures have various levels of effectiveness, challenges and social benefits. by Xixi Chen. Thesis (M. C. P.)

40|$|The {{decoupling}} {{hypothesis is}} the idea that business cycles in emerging market economies have become more independent from business cycles in advanced economies in recent years. Decoupling essentially amounts to a structural break in the degree of business cycle interdependence between the two groups of economies, and it can be tested as such. We develop an <b>innovative</b> <b>measure</b> of business cycle interdependence based on the Euclidean distance, available at the annual frequency, which allows for a proper test for a structural break in a graphical setup. We also make use of a standard econometric test. Both approaches point to the same conclusion: there has been no decoupling in recent years. In fact, the degree of business cycle interdependence has become stronger. ...|$|E

The model is applied to data on 86 recent Justice Department cases covering the period 1990 – 2003 and to the subsample of 1990 s cases. All data are collected from publicly available documents only. The government is found to secure larger divestitures when the cost to the acquirer of delaying the settlement is high. The resulting estimates are used to predict several out-of-sample observations.

40|$|Considerable {{ambiguity}} exists {{regarding the}} effect of government/opposition status on party platform change. Existing theories predict that (1) it has no effect, (2) opposition parties change more, (3) opposition parties change more after several spells in opposition, and (4) parties' responses vary because of different goal orientations. We propose that a party's aspiration to office, measured by its historical success or failure in entering office, determines a party's reaction to being in opposition or government. We hypothesize that, because of loss aversion, parties with low office aspiration change more {{when they are in}} government than when they are in opposition. Conversely, parties with high office aspiration change more as opposition party than as government party. We find evidence for these hypotheses through a pooled time-series cross-sectional analysis of 1, 686 platform changes in 21 democracies, using the Comparative Manifesto Data and an <b>innovative</b> <b>measure</b> of party platform change...|$|E
