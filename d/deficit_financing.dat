5|$|The most {{pressing}} economic matter the Nazis initially faced was the 30 percent national unemployment rate. Economist Dr. Hjalmar Schacht, President of the Reichsbank and Minister of Economics, created in May 1933 a scheme for <b>deficit</b> <b>financing.</b> Capital projects were {{paid for with}} the issuance of promissory notes called Mefo bills. When the notes were presented for payment, the Reichsbank printed money to do so. While the national debt soared, Hitler and his economic team expected that the upcoming territorial expansion would provide the means of repaying the debt. Schacht's administration achieved a rapid decline in the unemployment rate, the largest of any country during the Great Depression.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of budget <b>deficits</b> <b>financed</b> by taxing {{corporate}} incomes. As households are finitely lived, transfers and taxes on personal incomes are discounted {{at a higher rate}} than the interest on government debt. As corporations are infinitely lived, taxes on corporations are discounted {{at the same rate as}} the interest on government debt. Thus, unanticipated <b>deficits</b> <b>financed</b> by taxing corporate incomes are neutral. Anticipated <b>deficits</b> <b>financed</b> by taxing corporations cause a current account surplus, as transfers are then discounted at a higher rate than the taxes.

40|$|The goal of {{the paper}} is to analyze the {{importance}} of government debt in the propagation of fiscal shocks in the Argentine economy. For that reason we augment a standard fiscal policy vector Autoregression with the nominal debt to GDP ratio taken from a recently compiled IMF database. The main finding is that government debt has a crucial role for {{the implications of the}} model, and that the omission of the feedback of the debt (as a ratio of GDP) to the other variables in the system leads to very different conclusions for the effect of <b>deficit</b> <b>finance</b> government spending on the economy. Finally, we argue that not adding a measure of debt into the model is equivalent to assuming that debt as percentage of GDP is not changing following a <b>deficit</b> <b>financed</b> fiscal shock, which is in direct contraction to the implications of the optimal fiscal policy models. ...|$|R

The paper clarifies in particular the separate roles of finite horizons and declining labor income through life in the determination of steady state interest rates.

The study attempted to examine the effect of budget deficit on inflation and economic growth. Design of the research used a specification of a simultaneous macroeconomic model, consisting of twelve(12) behaviour equations and five (5) identity equations with three (3) blocks. The behaviour equations in the model were estimated by TSLS (two staqe least square). Data used were derived from the Indonesian economic secondary, data for the periode of 1993 - 2007.

In addition, the deficit also affected the economic growth as it might be found by building factors of national income. The rise of taxes affected increasing of nation's input.
