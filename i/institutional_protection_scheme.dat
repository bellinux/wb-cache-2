ISSN. 1547 - 5778. v. 21, n. 4, 2014, págs. 217 - 235 This study examines whether {{the reduction of}} the number of employees has actually been efficient in the restructuring undertaken in the European banking sector, focusing on the case of Spain but providing insight into restructuring and downsizing issues similar in other southern countries in Europe. In Spain, the concentration process has been more intense because of the financial crisis. For this purpose, the evolution of the number of employees in the subsector of the listed Banks was analyzed during the 2003 – 2012 period {{in order to have a}} timespan that would enable the diverse hypotheses to be verified under the double scenario of the economic boom (2003 – 2007) and the subsequent financial crisis (2008 – 2012). It was also during this second period when savings Banks disappeared and had to be converted into banks; meanwhile, other entities were involved in mergers, acquisitions, and also in hybrid and innovative formulas of concentration as the <b>Institutional</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>Schemes</b> (IPS). This transformation has given rise to a marked reduction of the commercial network. In this context, employment has been adversely affected. Using a model of linear regression with panel data, the results enable us to confirm that none of the findings obtained examining the relationship between downsizing and the increase of corporate efficiency allow us to conclude that the impact has been positive, as significant differences cannot be appreciated between the reduction of personnel and corporate efficiency...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper aims at {{modelling}} an electronically coupled distributed {{energy resource}} with an adaptive <b>protection</b> <b>scheme.</b> The electronically coupled {{distributed energy resource}} is a microgrid framework formed by coupling the renewable energy source electronically. Further, the proposed adaptive <b>protection</b> <b>scheme</b> provides a suitable protection to the microgrid for various fault conditions irrespective of the operating mode of the microgrid: namely, grid connected mode and islanded mode. The outstanding aspect of the developed adaptive <b>protection</b> <b>scheme</b> is that it monitors the microgrid and instantly updates relay fault current according to the variations {{that occur in the}} system. The proposed adaptive <b>protection</b> <b>scheme</b> also employs auto reclosures, through which the proposed adaptive <b>protection</b> <b>scheme</b> recovers faster from the fault and thereby increases the consistency of the microgrid.
