5|$|Arsenal {{then made}} their second substitution, {{bringing}} on Van Persie {{in place of}} Cesc Fàbregas. As the match entered injury time {{at the end of}} the second half, Ronaldo made yet another run down the left wing, outpacing Lauren to Rooney's through-ball. The ball broke back to Rooney 30 yards from goal, but his shot went over the bar. The second half finished with a Wes Brown cross from the right wing that made <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> the penalty area to Ronaldo, but the Portuguese could only head the ball straight at Lehmann.|$|E
5|$|NY252A {{began at}} an {{intersection}} with NY33A and NY386 in Chili Center, a hamlet {{located within the}} town of Chili. The route proceeded eastward from the commercial community and passed through largely residential neighborhoods on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> Chili. As it approached the Greater Rochester International Airport, the homes were gradually replaced by industrial factories and warehouses. It crossed the Rochester and Southern Railroad {{in the community of}} Maplewood just before intersecting Beahan Road, a local road that serves as the western extent of the airport property.|$|E

They advanced in small groups, supported by the heavy weapons of M/116, who were held {{at the base of}} the bluff. Progress was slowed by mines on the slopes of the bluff, but elements of all three rifle companies, as well as a stray section of G/116, had gained the top by 09:00, causing the defenders at WN-62 to mistakenly report that both WN-65 and WN-66 had been taken.|$|E

5|$|To {{ensure the}} success of the Chinese counterattack against ROK II Corps, the PVA 40th Corps was {{assigned}} the mission of protecting the PVA 38th Corps' flank against the US 2nd Infantry Division. To accomplish this mission, the PVA 119th Division of the 40th Corps would first attack Somin-dong and to prevent the Americans from reinforcing the Koreans. The 120th Division would then fight <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> the Ch'ongch'on River and tie down the bulk of the US 2nd Infantry Division. Finally, the 118th Division would flank the Americans from the west and capture Kujang-dong from the rear.|$|E
5|$|On 30 November, the 2/23rd {{reached the}} Song, {{fighting}} <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> {{and the next}} day, after sharp fighting amidst a renewed local counterattack by Japanese forces, Kuanko was taken. To {{the north of the}} abandoned village, the Japanese were positioned in strength and they launched a strong counterattack, which retook the vital high ground for them but was checked from progressing further by a heavy Australian artillery bombardment. At this stage, the 2/24th Infantry Battalion was released from its portage task and it was sent west to conduct a flanking movement around the Japanese position, cutting the Kuanko–Wareo track and capturing Kwatingkoo and Peak Hill early on 7 December, following a Japanese withdrawal. From there, it was a short march on to Wareo, which the Australians secured early the next day.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{began on}} 23 June as the English army {{attempted}} to force <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> {{the high ground}} of the Bannock Burn, which was surrounded by marshland. Skirmishing {{between the two sides}} broke out, resulting in the death of Sir Henry de Bohun, whom Robert killed in personal combat. Edward continued his advance the following day, and encountered the bulk of the Scottish army as they emerged from the woods of New Park. Edward appears not to have expected the Scots to give battle here, and as a result had kept his forces in marching, rather than battle, order, with the archers − who would usually have been used to break up enemy spear formations − {{at the back of his}} army, rather than the front. His cavalry found it hard to operate in the cramped terrain and were crushed by Robert's spearmen. The English army was overwhelmed and its leaders were unable to regain control.|$|E

50|$|A second train {{slammed into}} the first, which had stopped to allow an animal, {{described}} by various witnesses and officials as either a cow or a water buffalo, to make <b>its</b> <b>way</b> safely <b>across.</b> The second train was first class and had many passengers aboard; {{the first one was}} traveling light. It was thought that two carriages were wrecked completely.|$|R
5|$|The car speeds {{over the}} French {{countryside}} {{and into the}} Alps, leaping between mountains and knocking over a postman as it goes. At the gates of Dijon, town officials {{try to stop the}} car to enforce the octroi tax, but the car keeps its course and runs headlong into one of the officials, who explodes in his turn. The car wends <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> the Mediterranean coast, overturning a fruit stand, crashing through a greenhouse, colliding with a tar wagon (with another explosion ensuing), and, finally, arriving at the grandstand of spectators awaiting them at Monte Carlo. The car is now going at such speed that, rather than stopping in front of the grandstand, it somersaults up the stairs and crashes to earth. The King and chauffeur, unharmed by their adventurous race, are greeted warmly.|$|E
5|$|The highway follows West Main Street {{for several}} blocks into the city's {{downtown}} district, where it crosses the Norfolk Southern Railway's Southern Tier Line and intersects NY36. NY21 turns north onto NY36, separating from the WNYP and forming a concurrency with NY36 north along a four-lane divided highway {{known as the}} Maple City Bypass. The overlap ends {{north of the city}} limits in the town of Hornellsville, where NY21 splits from NY36 and resumes its northeasterly track. Not far to the north of this point is exit34 of the Southern Tier Expressway, accessed by way of NY36. From Hornell, NY21 heads northeast through progressively less developed areas as it winds <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> the hilly terrain of the Southern Tier. For the next , NY21 serves only small, roadside hamlets, such as Fremont, Haskinville, and Loon Lake.|$|E
5|$|With the {{infantry}} heavily engaged, Eugene's cavalry picked <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> the Nebel. After an initial success, his {{first line of}} cavalry, under the Imperial General of Horse, Prince Maximilian of Hanover, were pressed by the second line of Marsin's cavalry, and were forced back across the Nebel in confusion. Nevertheless, the exhausted French were unable to follow up their advantage, and the two cavalry forces tried to regroup and reorder their ranks. However, without cavalry support, and threatened with envelopment, the Prussian and Danish infantry were in turn forced to pull back across the Nebel. Panic gripped some of Eugene's troops as they crossed the stream. Ten infantry colours were lost to the Bavarians, and hundreds of prisoners taken; it was only through the leadership of Eugene and the Prussian Prince that the imperial infantry were prevented from abandoning the field.|$|E

5|$|At this point, the 9th Division's advance {{began to}} be {{hampered}} {{by a lack of}} supplies which, along with the rugged terrain, resulted in slow progress. It was not until 9 September that they reached the Busu River. The 2/28th Infantry Battalion was leading the Australian advance at this stage and the soldiers waded across. The current was strong and many of the men– 13 of whom drowned– were swept downstream. Nevertheless, the 2/28th was able to establish a beachhead west of the river. At this point, heavy rain began to fall again, and the river rose once more, preventing any other units from crossing. This effectively isolated the single Australian battalion, which was then subjected to repeated attacks by the Japanese. On 14 September, the 26th Brigade was able to force <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> and the advance continued. Along the coast the 24th Brigade was held up by a determined Japanese defence in front of the Butibum River, which was the final crossing before Lae. The stream was finally forded on 16 September, by which time Lae had fallen to troops from the 7th Division.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Panzer Division (XVIII Mountain Corps) entered Yugoslavia {{from the}} east {{on the morning of}} 6 April and {{advanced}} westward through the Struma Valley. It encountered little resistance, but was delayed by road clearance demolitions, mines and mud. Nevertheless, the division was able to reach the day's objective, the town of Strumica. On 7 April, a Yugoslav counter-attack against the division's northern flank was repelled, and the following day, the division forced <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> the mountains and overran the thinly manned defensive line of the Greek 19th Mechanized Division south of Doiran Lake. Despite many delays along the mountain roads, an armoured advance guard dispatched toward Thessaloniki succeeded in entering the city by the morning of 9 April. Thessaloniki was taken after a long battle with three Greek divisions under the command of General Bakopoulos, and was followed by the surrender of the Greek Eastern Macedonia Army Section, taking effect at 13:00 on 10 April. In the three days it took the Germans to reach Thessaloniki and breach the Metaxas Line, some 60,000 Greek soldiers were taken prisoner. The British and Commonwealth forces then took over the defence of Greece, with the bulk of the Greek Army fighting to maintain their old positions in Albania.|$|E
5|$|Training teams {{arrived from}} the 2/3rd Battalion, which had already fought the Japanese in New Guinea, and a program of jungle warfare {{training}} began, progressing from individual fieldcraft to large-scale exercises. In June, amphibious training was carried with the Australians working with the US 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment around Trinity Beach. The following month, a new commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Joshua, arrived. In early August, the battalion moved by road to Cairns. On 8 August 1943, the 2/43rd embarked upon HMAS Manoora, bound for Milne Bay in New Guinea. There, the battalion undertook further training in preparation for its debut in the Pacific. In mid-August, it moved by landing craft to Buna. It continued training there until 5 September, when the 24th Brigade embarked in landing craft for beaches near Lae, arriving {{the day after the}} main landing as part of follow-on forces behind the 20th and 26th Brigades. For 11 days, the battalion advanced west as part of a two-pronged advance on Lae, the 7th Division advancing overland from Nadzab while the 9th Division moved along the coast. Initially, there was only limited opposition from the Japanese as the battalion advanced through the villages of Buso and Apo, and the Singaua Plantation. The Burep River was crossed, but the Australian advance west was slowed by numerous water obstacles and eventually torrential rain which flooded the Busu River. At this point, Japanese resistance stiffened and after the 24th Brigade forced <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> the Busu, the 2/43rd advanced slowly along the coast, reaching Wagan to the south of Malahang airfield. On 16 September, the 7th Division entered Lae, with the 2/43rd situated around the Butibum River. The advance on Lae cost the battalion 18 killed and 25 wounded.|$|E

Also in 1841, an overland exploratory party of the United States Exploring Expedition came down the Siskiyou Trail from the Pacific Northwest. In 1844, Caleb Greenwood guided the first settlers to take wagons over the Sierra Nevada. In 1846, the misfortunes of the Donner Party earned notoriety as they struggled to enter California.|$|E
25|$|NY243 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY98 in the Cattaraugus County town of Freedom, {{just north of}} the Farmersville–Freedom town line.
