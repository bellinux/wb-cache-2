The fraction that is rejected for further treatment can vary from 10 to 50 % depending on process strategy and final product which can be from printing paper, writing paper, paperboard middle layer and tissue. In practice, it is common that approximately 10 % of the pulp fibres and also {{a large part of the}} <b>fines</b> <b>fraction</b> have properties that are unsatisfactory in relation to the final products. Part of the less useful <b>fines</b> <b>fraction</b> could instead be used to produce nano-ligno-cellulose (NLC) of high value either in the main product or used for completely different purposes. In order to study the potential of this concept, treatment of thermo-mechanical pulp (TMP) <b>fines</b> <b>fractions</b> were studied by means of homogenization. It seems possible to homogenize fine particles of thermo-mechanical pulp (1 % w/v) to NLC. A corresponding <b>fines</b> <b>fraction</b> from bleached kraft pulp (BKP) was tested as a reference at 0. 5 % w/v concentration. This <b>fines</b> (BKP) <b>fraction</b> was very difficult to homogenize at a higher concentration (1 % w/v). An explanation for this could be that the BKP fines have much higher cellulose content and lower charge level compared to the <b>fines</b> <b>fraction</b> of the hemicellulose and lignin-rich TMP.

5000|$|Lunar soil is the <b>fine</b> <b>fraction</b> of the {{regolith}} {{found on}} the surface of the Moon. Its properties can differ significantly from those of terrestrial soil. The physical properties of lunar soil are primarily the result of mechanical disintegration of basaltic and anorthositic rock, caused by continuous meteoric impact and bombardment by interstellar charged atomic particles over years. The process is largely one of mechanical weathering in which the particles are ground to finer and finer size over time. This situation contrasts fundamentally to terrestrial soil formation, mediated by the presence of molecular oxygen (O2), humidity, atmospheric wind, and a robust array of contributing biological processes.

40|$|Internal {{instability}} {{is a form}} {{of internal}} erosion in broadly graded cohesionless soils in which fine particles can be eroded at lower hydraulic gradients than predicted by classical theory for piping or heave. A key mechanism enabling internal instability is the formation of a stress-transmitting matrix dominated by the coarse particles, which leaves the finer particles under lower effective stress. In this study, discrete element modeling is used to analyze the fabric and effective stress distribution within idealized gap-graded samples with varying potential for internal stability. The reduction in stress within the <b>finer</b> <b>fraction</b> of the materials is directly quantified from grain-scale data. The particle-size distribution, percentage <b>finer</b> <b>fraction,</b> and relative density are found to influence the stress distribution.

The organic pollutants PCB, Organochlorpesticides (OCP) and PAH were investigated in three <b>fine</b> sediment <b>fractions</b> and < 63 #mu#m of the locations by accredited and standardised methods. At the same time the cofactor Organic Carbon (TOC) as well as Total Carbon (TC) and Total Nitrogen (TN) were determined in the <b>fine</b> sediment <b>fractions.</b> The endocrine disruptor Bisphenol A could be detected in the sediment locations B and C. The comparison of TOC, TC and TN average values by t-test showed significant differences between the <b>fine</b> <b>fractions</b> of location B and C. Because of low TOC values no signification was detectable in sediment A. The results show that the TOC values in fine sediments are affected by sieving. An enrichment of carbon was detected in the < 63 #mu#m fraction in consideration of variance. A correlation between the cofactor TOC and the organic pollutant values could only be detected in the <b>fine</b> <b>fractions</b> of location B. The enrichment of pollutant values in the <b>fine</b> <b>fractions</b> was here analogue of TOC. For a comprehensive evaluation of the cofactor TOC no sufficient sieving sample materials were available in this study for location A and C.

This study involves 21 direct shear tests to investigate the constitutive behavior of composite soils within the normal stress range from 50 to 200 kPa.

Increasing <b>fine</b> <b>fraction</b> from zero to a threshold value (approximately 20 – 30 %) causes a decrease in void ratio of the mixture.

Particle size distribution (PSD) of FA {{plays an important role in}} the AMD treatment quality and viscosity of the SR that can be used directly for backfill purposes. In this study, we have investigated the effect of PSD of FA on AMD neutralisation and metal removal. This work also looked at the effect of PSD on the rheology of the SR.
