5|$|Cynics {{were often}} {{recognized}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> world by their apparel - an old cloak and a staff.

These items became so symbolic of the Cynic vocation that ancient writers accosted those who thought that donning the Cynic garb would make them suited to the philosophy.|$|E
