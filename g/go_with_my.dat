Because everybody's got an opinion, {{and so many}} people's {{opinions}} about me are like polar opposites. They're like, 'We love it when she does ballads, make her do the ballads.' Then they're like, 'We {{want to hear a}} hip-hop record.' 'Why is she dressing like this? She should show less skin.' 'She should show more.' You know what I mean? I'm like, 'Stay in your lane, and I'll figure it out.' ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Arthur Pierson, and was produced by Glenn Goodwin, while Wayne Isham {{was in charge of}} photography. At the time of the song's release, Madonna's style of dress was catching on as a fashion statement among club kids and her fans. The most prominent among her fashion accessories were the crucifixes she wore as earrings and necklaces. Madonna commented that wearing a rosary and a crucifix is [...] "kind of offbeat and interesting. I mean, everything I do is sort of tongue-in-cheeks. Besides, the crucifixes seem to <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> name." [...] In reality, she was trying to find a separate image for herself, being inspired by then artists like Boy George, Cyndi Lauper and David Bowie, and their constantly shifting image and persona. Madonna realized the importance of her music videos and its popularity via MTV—launched in 1981—was instrumental in popularizing her image.|$|E
500|$|In February 2014, Madonna {{announced}} that she had begun working on her thirteenth studio album, saying [...] "I'm {{right now in the}} process of talking to various co-writers and producers and talking about where I want to <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> music". By the next month she started posting a number of images on social media website Instagram, where she hinted at possible songwriters and collaborators with hashtag captions. Two months later, Madonna posted a selfie where she talked about working with American DJ Diplo. Madonna had invited him to her annual Oscar party, but he was unable to attend. They eventually started talking about music through texts and decided to collaborate on the album. In an interview with Idolator, Diplo explained that Madonna had asked him to provide his [...] "craziest record" [...] for the album. Together they wrote and recorded seven songs and Diplo added that [...] " [...] was up for anything. I love when an artist gives a producer the confidence he needs to work with them, and [...] was very open-minded to my ideas. Those records are gonna be crazy-sounding. We really pushed the envelope with some of the stuff we were doing." ...|$|E

500|$|By December 2013, Madonna's manager Guy Oseary {{commented that}} the singer was [...] "eager to get started" [...] on her next album. However, she had another project in mind – {{developing}} the screenplay for the Andrew Sean Greer novel, The Impossible Lives of Greta Wells. Madonna decided to split her time between writing the screenplay and writing songs for the new album. In February 2014, Madonna confirmed that she had already begun working on her thirteenth studio album, saying: [...] "I'm {{right now in the}} process of talking to various co-writers and producers and talking about where I want to <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> music". Working with a number of collaborators on the album, Madonna encountered problems in keeping a cohesive sound and creative direction for Rebel Heart, since her previous efforts had been produced with only a small core group of people developing the music. She observed that a lot of the people she enlisted would not stay in one city at a time due to their different projects, resulting in Madonna not finishing her songs. [...] "So, I was just the person standing there with a clipboard in the headlights, going 'Ok!' A little bit like a school teacher," [...] she admitted.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} re-released in 1985 for the European market and re-packaged as Madonna: The First Album with a {{different}} artwork created by photographer George Holy. The cover features Madonna in similar style of dress to the original cover but this time with crucifix as her earrings. Madonna's trademark style was catching on as a fashion statement among club kids and fans, with her crucifix accessories becoming the jewelry of the moment. Madonna said that wearing a crucifix is [...] "kind of offbeat and interesting. I mean, everything I do is sort of tongue-in-cheeks. Besides, the crucifixes seem to <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> name." [...] In 2001, Warner Bros. Records released a remastered version of the album with its original artwork and two bonus remix tracks of [...] "Burning Up" [...] and [...] "Lucky Star". Madonna dedicated the album to her father, Tony Ciccone, with whom her relationship had not been good until {{the release of the}} album. In an interview with Time magazine, Madonna said: [...] "My father had never believed that what I was doing here [...] was worthwhile, nor did he believe that I was up to any good. [...] It wasn't until my first album came out and my father started hearing my songs on the radio that he stopped asking the questions." ...|$|E
