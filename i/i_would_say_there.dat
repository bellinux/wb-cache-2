5000|$|In 2010, Eric Peterson issued another {{statement}} via Terrorizer magazine: Our {{record label}} has recently expressed doubt over the upcoming album's potential. At first we were fucking {{but then we}} were all sadly brought to reality. Reception to Black metal is possibly the most limited of all in the entire music world; especially the U.S. where the genre's epically failed to find its feet as established movement. So given the circumstances we need to let fans know that making adjustments to the current recordings would put us back another good few thousand. That'd mean possibly creeping into the Testament budget. As I mentioned before, I am not prepared to make any financial risks with DragonLord until we become as followed as bands like Slipknot or Dimmu Borgir. So <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>there's</b> around an 83% chance the album won't be developed and on the streets at all, 13% chance of me making adjustments and around a 10% of finishing the band. Anyone who knows me will respect my honesty and I can tell you DragonLord doesn't have a future, {{we would like to}} make another album; but the metal scene is difficult to flourish in. Dragon definitely withstands no chance. - Eric Peterson ...|$|R

It’s one of those things that creates a lot of difficulty just for myself, but it’s the kind of difficulty I need to embrace because it makes me a better artist. And I do not want to be one of those artists that falls off later, I want to be one of those artists that is continually pushing the bar. But going back to certain songs on the album that were more difficult than others, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say.</b> <b>There’s</b> a song called “Miriam Got a Mickey” that was pretty difficult, there’s a song called “Ghetto Superhero” that wasn’t that easy.

Some such sentiments as these I stated in a letter to my generous patron, Mr. Graham, which he laid before the Board at large; where, it seems, my last remark gave great offence: and one of our supervisors-general, a Mr. Corbet, was instructed to inquire on the spot, and to document me--"that my business was to act, not to think; and that whatever might be men or measures, it was for me to be silent and obedient".|$|E

6000|$|In {{speaking}} of Mr. George H. Boughton, A.R.A., I encounter the same difficulty as with Mr. Millet: I find the window closed through which alone almost {{it is just}} to take a view of his talent. Mr. Boughton is a painter about whom there is little that is new to tell to-day, so conspicuous and incontestable is his achievement, the fruit of a career of which the beginning was not yesterday. He is a draughtsman and an illustrator only on occasion and by accident. These accidents have mostly occurred, however, {{in the pages of}} Harper, and the happiest of them will still be fresh in the memory of its readers. In the Sketching Rambles in Holland Mr. Abbey was a participant (as witness, among many things, the admirable drawing of the old Frisian woman bent over her Bible in church, with the heads of the burghers just visible above the rough archaic pew-tops--a drawing opposite to page 112 in the handsome volume into which these contributions were eventually gathered together); but most of the sketches were Mr. Boughton's, and the charming, amusing text is altogether his, save {{in the sense that it}} commemorates his companion's impressions as well as his own--the delightful, irresponsible, visual, sensual, pictorial, capricious impressions of a painter in a strange land, the person surely whom at particular moments one would give most to be. If there be anything happier than the impressions of a painter, it is the impressions of two, and the combination is set forth with uncommon spirit and humor in this frank record of the innocent lust of the eyes. Mr. Boughton scruples little, in general, to write as well as to draw, when the fancy takes him; to write in the manner of painters, with the bold, irreverent, unconventional, successful brush. If I were not afraid of the patronizing tone <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that <b>there</b> is little doubt that if as a painter he had not had to try to write in character, he would certainly have made a characteristic writer. He has the most enviable [...] "finds," [...] not dreamed of in timid literature, yet making capital descriptive prose. Other specimens of them may be encountered in two or three Christmas tales, signed with the name whose usual place is the corner of a valuable canvas.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Mayor, {{and ladies}} and gentlemen, if I may venture {{to take a}} small {{illustration}} of my present position from my own peculiar craft, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that <b>there</b> is this objection in writing fiction to giving a story an autobiographical form, that through whatever dangers the narrator may pass, it is clear unfortunately to the reader beforehand {{that he must have}} come through them somehow else he could not have lived to tell the tale. Now, in speaking fact, when the fact is associated with such honours as those with which you have enriched me, there is this singular difficulty in the way of returning thanks, that the speaker must infallibly come back to himself through whatever oratorical disasters he may languish on the road. Let me, then, take the plainer and simpler middle course of dividing my subject equally between myself and you. Let me assure you that whatever you have accepted with pleasure, either by word of pen or by word of mouth, from me, you have greatly improved in the acceptance. As the gold is said to be doubly and trebly refined which has seven times passed the furnace, so a fancy may be said to become more and more refined each time it passes through the human heart. You have, and you know you have, brought to the consideration of me that quality in yourselves without which I should but have beaten the air. Your earnestness has stimulated mine, your laughter has made me laugh, and your tears have overflowed my eyes. All that I can claim for myself in establishing the relations which exist between us is constant fidelity to hard work. My literary fellows about me, of whom I am so proud to see so many, know very well how true it is in all art that what seems the easiest done is oftentimes the most difficult to do, and that the smallest truth may come of the greatest pains-- much, as it occurred to me at Manchester the other day, as the sensitive touch of Mr. Whitworth's measuring machine, comes at last, of Heaven and Manchester and its mayor only know how much hammering--my companions-in-arms know thoroughly well, and I think it only right the public should know too, that in our careful toil and trouble, and in our steady striving for excellence--not in any little gifts, misused by fits and starts--lies our highest duty at once to our calling, to one another, to ourselves, and to you.|$|R

How you were involved?"Leo Castelli: [...] "Well, it came into being as an outgrowth precisely of the things that you've been asking constantly about: of what kind of feelings the American painters had in connection with their position toward the European painters. It was sort of an outburst of pride in their own strength. And we considered this almost as the first Salon des Independents; this is what I called it as a matter of fact. I was very proud of that aspect of it. I thought that never before anything of the kind had occurred in America. We had about ninety painters in it and they were almost exclusively <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> because <b>there</b> were a few exceptions, composed of artists who were involved with The Club. Not all of them members but at least people who gravitated around The Club and came often because also non-members were admitted there, of course. So the major figures there were: de Kooning, who had taken an important hand in the development of The Club; actually he was much more active then in, say, group activities than he is now; he has become rather solitary, as you know. De Kooning was very important. Franz Kline was very important, Marca-Relli was a good organizer; he was involved in it."Rose: [...] "Was all the painting abstract?"Castelli: [...] "It was mostly <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> abstract, yes. Because people like Larry Rivers and Joan Mitchell, Grace Hartigan - Joan Mitchell stayed abstract - especially those two who later became figurative painting came right after that."Rose: [...] "Did the Show make much of a splash? Was there much public reaction to it?"Castelli: [...] "Well, it was a great event. We had a stream right across the street. It was a very wonderful warm day. This was in an empty store - in a house that was up for demolition and we had paid, I think, $70 to have it for two months before it got demolished. All the painters had participated in refurbishing it, in painting this place that was almost abandoned. And it was very nice and neat. There are photographs to show you how it looked. And Franz had designed the announcement which was just a sheet of paper. I think it cost twenty-five dollars. And it seemed a lot of money. I sort of footed most of the bill although I didn't have much money either. I think that I forked out as much as $200 and that seemed a tremendous amount of money for the rent, and for this catalogue that cost $25 the Franz designed. We were all there for three days hanging and re-hanging the show. All kinds of painters who were dissatisfied with the way they hung, I remember. Rauschenberg was included in it, Reinhardt was included in it. David Smith, poor man, had a beautiful sculpture right in the window. Pollock was included, although he did not participate too much in Club activities. But he was painting." ...|$|R

5000|$|His {{record as}} {{coach of the}} Auburn Tigers is 634-328-0. From 1985-2001 he won more {{baseball}} games than any coach in Auburn history. His overall coaching record is 779-394-1 (.663). Baird guided the Tigers to three NCAA Regional titles, an SEC Western Division Championship and an SEC Tournament Championship and 10 times during Baird's Auburn tenure his teams finish the season ranked in the top 25.

Ten Auburn players earned All-America honors under Baird's tutelage while a total of 51 players were drafted off of Baird's teams, which included Gregg Olson, Bo Jackson, Frank Thomas and Tim Hudson.
