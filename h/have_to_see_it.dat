500|$|The {{music video}} was co-directed by Ray Kay and Beyoncé for the B'Day Anthology Video Album, which was {{released}} the same month: {{it was one}} of eight videos shot in two weeks for the album. The choreography was done by Danielle Polanco and Jonte' Moaning, who used a 1980s retro set. Beyoncé explained the concept of the video at MTV: [...] "It's probably the most flamboyant video, and the metallic dresses are so beautiful, they added so much color. I had to do a video for this song. Everyone wanted to know what a 'freakum dress' was, and you can't really explain it, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it.</b> Everyone has their own version, so we had so many women — of different races, sizes, shapes, ages — because we all have those dresses we pull out when we need to shut it down." ...|$|E
500|$|Bolt {{stated that}} setting a record {{was not a}} {{priority}} for him, and that his goal was just to win the gold medal, Jamaica's first of the 2008 Games. Olympic medallist Kriss Akabusi construed Bolt's chest slapping before the finish line as showboating, noting that the actions cost Bolt an even faster record time. IOC president Jacques Rogge also condemned the Jamaican's actions as disrespectful. Bolt denied {{that this was the}} purpose of his celebration by saying, [...] "I wasn't bragging. When I saw I wasn't covered, I was just happy". Lamine Diack, president of the IAAF, supported Bolt and said that his celebration was appropriate given the circumstances of his victory. Jamaican government minister Edmund Bartlett also defended Bolt's actions, stating, [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> in the glory of their moment and give it to them. We have to allow the personality of youth to express itself".|$|E
500|$|On February 13–15, 2009, Keenan debuted Puscifer at the Pearl Concert Theater in Palms Casino Resort in Paradise, Nevada, with a cabaret-style show so {{abstract}} it is {{not easily}} described. In {{an interview with the}} Los Angeles Times, Keenan stated [...] "we didn't really have any clue what to call it, so we just kind of called it cabaret." [...] Keenan—who has had previous experience with this type of entertainment, having fronted a similar show in Los Angeles before achieving fame with Tool—went on to add that [...] "you just can't really describe it, you just <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> then it makes sense." [...] Featuring an ever-changing lineup of artists including Milla Jovovich and Primus drummer Tim Alexander, the show was originally said to have a long-term residency at the Pearl; however, Keenan later revealed that it was to be only a two-show performance.|$|E
50|$|The {{proprioceptive}} system {{concerns a}} person's joints and muscles. It tells the brain if {{a part of}} the body is moving without actually <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it.</b> It also controls eating, writing, and using utensils. This sense enables a person to understand the amount of pressure used to carry out routine tasks, such as eating and writing. Bodily pressure is part of this as well; for example, a child may enjoy being held tighter by someone or leaning into things such as walls, desks, and potentially other people.|$|R

500|$|Most of {{the lyrics}} on Beating as One deal with melancholy emotions. The track [...] "Stockholm Syndrome", {{which is the first}} Yo La Tengo song sung by McNew, is about captives {{eventually}} expressing empathy toward their captors and vice versa. It was described by prominent music critic Robert Christgau as a [...] "simulated Neil Young ballad". The song [...] "Autumn Sweater", which is layered with complex rhythms and textures, explores themes of love and lack of communication, while [...] "Center of Gravity" [...] has been described as [...] "a simple lo-fi devotional love song". Beating as One also marks the debut of Kaplan's falsetto singing, which was said to blur the line between his voice and that of drummer Georgia Hubley. The album's title is taken from a line in an unknown film. According to Kaplan, [...] "I think it's a nice, evocative title—it seems to mean a lot but it doesn't really mean anything. It comes from a movie, but I'm not telling what movie. You'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> one day and say, 'Eureka!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Stephenson's process {{progresses}} from sketch pad, {{to computer}} graphics, to clay models, and finally test models. He says {{the advantage of}} working with clay {{is that you can}} feel the transitions and feel where there is too much surface or more surface needed. He suggests that you could almost design a car blind, because [...] "you don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> you have to feel it, and by feeling it you feel if it's right or it's not right".|$|E

R.F. also uses one of Freed's favorite expressions {{when he says that}} he [...] "cannot quite visualize it" [...] and <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> on film first, referring to the [...] "Broadway Melody" [...] sequence.

2500|$|In 1919, {{the magician}} P. T. Selbit staged a séance {{at his own}} flat in Bloomsbury. Doyle {{attended}} the séance. Some later commentators have stated that he declared the clairvoyance manifestations to be genuine. However, the contemporary report by the Sunday Express quotes Doyle as saying: [...] "I should <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> again before passing a definite opinion on it," [...] and: [...] "I have my doubts about the whole thing". In 1920, Doyle debated the claims of Spiritualism with the notable sceptic Joseph McCabe at Queen's Hall in London. McCabe later published his evidence against the claims of Doyle and Spiritualism in a booklet entitled Is Spiritualism Based on Fraud? which claimed Doyle had been duped into believing Spiritualism by mediumship trickery.|$|E
2500|$|Legends of Bikini Bottom {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} media critics. Nancy Basile of About.com positively {{reacted to the}} series {{and gave it a}} 4 out of 5 rating. She cited her favorite episodes like [...] "Welcome to the Bikini Bottom Triangle" [...] and [...] "The Main Drain". She said [...] "Firstly, you know an episode will be funny when it's titled 'Bikini Bottom Triangle'. My children had no idea why I was laughing at the title frame." [...] her favorite scenes from the episode were [...] "Gary's booty, watching the old sea dog spit his story and figuring out why Patrick wears cuff links." [...] In another episode called [...] "The Main Drain", she said [...] "I won't ruin the set up because it's just so funny, but my favorite line is, 'It's now or never.'

2500|$|Later at a {{drive-in}} theater, Pee-wee and Dottie {{attend the}} premiere of his biopic, an action movie starring James Brolin as [...] "P.W. Herman" [...] and Morgan Fairchild as Dottie. The two must retrieve a sport bike called the X-1, which contains an important microfilm and has been stolen by ninjas. Pee-wee has a cameo appearance as a hotel bellhop. At the drive-in, Pee-wee gives refreshments {{to all the people}} he met along his journey. Pee-wee also encounters Francis, who tells reporters that he is Pee-wee's best friend who taught him how to ride. Francis claims to be knowledgeable about Pee-wee's bike, but accidentally catapults himself into the air using one of the bicycle's gadgets. As Pee-wee leaves the drive-in, Dottie asks why he is not staying {{for the rest of the}} movie. Pee-wee answers, [...] "I don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> Dottie. I lived it." [...] He and Dottie then ride off together.|$|E

2500|$|Minaj and will.i.am {{appeared}} {{together at}} the 2010 VMA's Pre-show, where the duo performed [...] "Check It Out" [...] as well as Minaj appearing alone to perform her single [...] "Your Love". Rap-Up magazine said the performance had eccentric dancing and pink escapades. However a Chris Ryan from MTV Buzzworthy was less impressed with the duo appearing as The Jetsons. He said [...] "The WTF? ... Look, we LOVE Nicki Minaj. We would fake-marry her if Drake hadn't already fake-married her. And one thing we really, really love about Nicki Minaj is the wild and crazy looks she breaks out. But given the flack he's taken {{in the last few}} days over his, um, unique choice in attire, she might have wanted to pregame with Will.i.am a little harder, regarding his stage fashion." [...] He later went on to say that Minaj's performance lived up to expectations. [...] "And of course, Nicki more than delivered. Harajuku Barbie really brought the house down with [...] "Check It Out", You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> to believe it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2006 Thedore McCarrick, as Archbishop of Washington, {{indicated}} an acceptance for such unions. [...] In 2013 Christoph Schonborn, the Cardinal Archbishop of Vienna, stated: [...] "There can be same-sex partnerships {{and they need}} respect, and even civil law protection." [...] Cardinal Ruben Salazar Gomez of Bogota has said: [...] "Other unions {{have the right to}} exist, no one can ask them not to, but they should not be equated to marriage". The former Papal Master of Ceremonies, Archbishop Piero Marini, has said: [...] "Church and state should not be enemies to one another. In these discussions, it's necessary, for instance, to recognize the union of persons of the same sex, because there are many couples that suffer because their civil rights aren't recognized." [...] Godfried Danneels, Archbishop Emeritus of Brussels, has called the legalisation of same-sex civil marriage [...] "a positive evolution", and added that the Church has nothing to say about whether states can legalise civil marriage for gay people Cardinal Rainer Woelki the Archbishop of Berlin has also stated: [...] "If two homosexuals take responsibility for each other when they are in a stable and faithful relationship, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> in a similar way to heterosexual relationships." ...|$|E
