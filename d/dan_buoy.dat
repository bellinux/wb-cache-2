5000|$|A {{floating}} man-overboard pole or <b>dan</b> <b>buoy</b> {{can be used}} {{to indicate}} that a person is in distress in the water and is ordinarily equipped with a yellow and red flag (international code of signals flag [...] "O") and a flashing lamp or strobe light.|$|E
50|$|Postwar, 17 of the {{trawlers}} were disarmed as wreck disposal vessels: Bardsey (DV13), Bern (DV4), Caldy (DV5) Coll (DV6), Earraid (DV7), Fetlar (DV8), Flatholm (DV9), Graemsay (DV10), Lindisfarne (DV11), Lundy (DV12), Neave (DV14), Scalpay (DV15), Skomer (DV16), Steepholm (DV17), Switha (DV18), Tiree (DV19), and Trondra (DV20). At {{least five}} were employed as danlayers (laying and retrieving <b>dan</b> <b>buoys</b> during minesweeping operations): Imersay (J422), Sandray (J424), Shillay (J426), Sursay (J427) and Tocogay (J451). After decommissioning, Switha and Coll {{were converted to}} oil tank cleaning vessels for dockyard service in 1949-50.|$|R
50|$|In August 1942 Bangor was {{involved}} in Operation Jubilee - the raid on Dieppe. As a large area of Dieppe was {{believed to have been}} mined by the enemy, the minesweepers opened proceedings for the raid. During the afternoon of 18 August, the 9th and 13th MSFs sailed separately from Portsmouth for the vicinity of Beachy Head, so as {{to give the impression that}} one was carrying out a clearance sweep in the area, the other proceeding on passage up the channel. The 9th Flotilla commenced sweeping at 00:03 and at 01:05 turned to port and got in sweeps; the 13th Flotilla began 8 minutes earlier and finished at 00:51. Everything went without a hitch; the channel was about four cables wide, clearly marked on both sides and at the ends; only one mine was seen. The Flotillas then manoeuvred to keep clear of the approaching expedition and soon after 05:00 turned for home, setting flag <b>Dan</b> <b>buoys</b> to mark the channels in daylight on the way back. They returned in company to Portsmouth, having carried out their work with efficiency and precision.|$|R
50|$|The net is deployed, {{with one}} end {{attached}} to an anchored <b>dan</b> (marker) <b>buoy,</b> {{by the main}} vessel, the seiner, or by a smaller auxiliary boat. A drag line is paid out, followed by a net wing. As the seiner sweeps in a big circle returning to the buoy, the deployment continues with the seine bag and the remaining wing, finishing with the remaining drag line. In this way a large area can be surrounded. Next the drag lines are hauled in using rope-coiling machines until the catch bag can be secured.|$|R
