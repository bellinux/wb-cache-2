The accumulation of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) mRNA, a marker of neoplastic status, was analysed by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The data obtained demonstrated that only <b>extracts</b> <b>from</b> E. officinalis induce an increase of ERalpha mRNA in MCF 7 cells. When MDA-MB- 231 cell line was employed, <b>extracts</b> <b>from</b> E. officinalis, V. anthelmintica and A. mexicana {{were found to be}} inducers of the increase of ERalpha mRNA accumulation.

Among the two mushrooms, ethanol <b>extracts</b> <b>from</b> A. mellea was more effective than that from H. serotina in scavenging DPPH free radical ability, while ethanol <b>extracts</b> <b>from</b> H. serotina was some higher than that from A. mellea in reducing power.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate various antigen preparation, to determine the optimum method for producing antiserum of the desired titer and specificity, and to know whether antiserum from fresh meat still capable to determine <b>extract</b> <b>from</b> cooked meat. Six kinds of <b>extract</b> antigen <b>from</b> beef and 3 kinds of meat proteins were used in the research. Those were 6 kinds of <b>extract</b> antigen <b>from</b> fresh meat, wet dendeng, dry dendeng, frest bakso, cooked bakso and abon, and 3 kinds of meat protein from globulin, myoglobin and actomyosin. The rabbit were injected intramusculary and intravenausly on alternate weeks for eight injections and were tested every week to detect titers of antiserum. The results showed that intramuscular and intravenous injection of <b>extract</b> antigen <b>from</b> frest meat, frest bakso and cooked bakso emulsified in Freund Complete Adjuvant causad antibodies production higher titers thant wet dendeng and dry dendeng, whereas <b>extract</b> <b>from</b> abon showed a negative gel diffusion response after 8 weeks injection.

40|$|Four culinary-medicinal fungi and {{mushrooms}} (Cordyceps sinensis, Termitomyces albuminosus, Antrodia camphorata, and A. salmonea) were individually inoculated into different cooked grains, and new products were formed after fungal fermentation and their antioxidant properties studied. The effectiveness of ethanolic extracts in antioxidant activities {{was in the}} descending order: the grains > products > mycelia. EC(50) values of the hot water <b>extract</b> <b>from</b> four products in reducing power were 2. 14 - 10. 11 mg/mL, whereas those of the ethanolic extracts were 2. 56 - 71. 34 mg/mL. With regard to scavenging ability, all EC(50) values of both <b>extracts</b> <b>from</b> 12 samples were less than 13 mg/mL, except for the hot water <b>extract</b> <b>from</b> A. camphorata mycelium.
