We analyzed genomes of two <b>deep-sea</b> <b>vent</b> ε-Proteobacteria strains, Sulfurovum sp. NBC 37 - 1 and Nitratiruptor sp. SB 155 - 2, which provide insights not only into their unusual niche on the seafloor, but also into {{the origins of}} virulence in their pathogenic relatives, Helicobacter and Campylobacter species. The <b>deep-sea</b> <b>vent</b> ε-proteobacterial genomes encode for multiple systems for respiration, sensing and responding to environment, and detoxifying heavy metals, reflecting their adaptation to the <b>deep-sea</b> <b>vent</b> environment. Although they are nonpathogenic, both <b>deep-sea</b> <b>vent</b> ε-Proteobacteria share many virulence genes with pathogenic ε-Proteobacteria, including genes for virulence factor MviN, hemolysin, invasion antigen CiaB, and the N-linked glycosylation gene cluster. In addition, some virulence determinants (such as the H 2 -uptake hydrogenase) and genomic plasticity of the pathogenic descendants appear to have roots in <b>deep-sea</b> <b>vent</b> ε-Proteobacteria. These provide ecological advantages for hydrothermal vent ε-Proteobacteria who thrive in their deep-sea habitat and are essential for both the efficient colonization and persistent infections of their pathogenic relatives.

This shrimp swarms around the hot {{end of the}} {{hydrothermal}} biotope where temperature can exceed its critical maximal temperature (33 - 38. 5 +/- 2 degrees C). It may therefore be subjected to a thermal regime that {{is assumed to be}} stressful for animals. In this study, we used a global transcriptomic approach by constructing suppression subtractive hybridization cDNA libraries in order to identify specific up- and down-regulated genes in R. exoculata exposed to a severe heat stress (1 h at 30 degrees C). A total of 218 sequences representing potentially highly expressed genes in thermally stressed shrimp were obtained. Expression of 11 genes involved in various cell functions was quantified in control and heat shocked specimens using real-time PCR. Differential expression was observed for some specific genes such as mannose receptor Cl, metalloprotease, histone H 1, and hemocyanin with a strong up-regulation of several genes encoding heat shock proteins. These results suggest that R. exoculata is affected at both cellular and molecular levels by sustained exposure at 30 degrees C.

40|$|The <b>deep-sea</b> <b>vent</b> shrimp Rimicaris exoculata is {{believed}} to occur {{at the hot end}} of the hydrothermal biotope in order to provide essential elements to its epibiosis. Because it is found close to hot venting water, R. exoculata lives in a highly fluctuating environment where temperature (2 – 40 °C in the swarms) can exceed its critical maximal temperature (33 – 38. 5 ± 2 °C). In order to understand how this vent shrimp copes with hyperthermia, we compared its molecular heat stress response following an acute but non-lethal heat-shock (1 h at 30 °C) with that of its monophyletic shallow-water relative, the shrimp Palaemonetes varians, known to frequently undergo prolonged exposure at temperatures up to 30 °C in its natural environment during summer. We isolated four isoforms of heat-shock proteins 70 (HSP 70) in R. exoculata (2 constitutive and 2 inducible isoforms) and two isoforms in P. varians (1 constitutive and 1 inducible isoform) and quantitatively compared their magnitude of induction at mRNA level, using real-time PCR, in the case of experimentally heat-stressed shrimps, with respect to control (unstressed) animals. Here, we report the first quantification of the expression of multiple hsp 70 genes following heat stress in a <b>deep-sea</b> <b>vent</b> species living at 2300 m depth.
