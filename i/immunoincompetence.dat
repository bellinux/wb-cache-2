40|$|The {{immunocompetence}} of the circulating lymphocytes of {{a patient}} with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was evaluated before, during and after treatment. The immunologic features investigated were (a) the degree of blastogenic transformation induced by phytomitogens (phytohemagglutinin-M, concanavalin A and pokeweed mitogen); (b) the formation of E, EA and EAC rosettes; and (c) antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Prior to treatment the subnormal in vitro responsiveness of the cells and the very low concentrations of circulating immunoglobulins suggested <b>immunoincompetence.</b> A gradual shift towards normal in vitro values was observed during treatment, which corresponded to the clinical improvement in the patient's condition...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients on {{hemodialysis}} {{suffer from}} an impaired immunity against infectious agents, hyporesponsiveness to vaccination and {{are prone to}} develop malignancies. This clinical state of <b>immunoincompetence</b> {{may be due to}} a disbalance in their defense mechanisms in which TNF-alpha and its soluble receptors 1 and 2 play a central role. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We measured, with double-sandwich ELISA, the levels of TNF-alpha and the soluble TNF-receptors in peripheral blood of patients on chronic intermittent hemodialysis (CIHD), on peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and pre-dialysis end-stage renal failure (ESRF). Using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis, we quantified the amount of TNF-alpha mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from these patient groups. RESULTS: In none of the patient groups, elevated levels of TNF-alpha were detected with ELISA, while high levels of soluble TNF receptors were present in ESRF, CAPD and CIHD patients. This {{may be the result of}} an activated TNF-alpha system or due to their impaired renal clearance. TNF-alpha mRNA level was elevated in CIHD patients compared to ESRF and CAPD patients or healthy controls. CONCLUSION: This suggests that only during chronic HD is the TNF-alpha system activated. High levels of sTNFR, found in ESRF or CAPD patients do not reflect activation of TNF-alpha system, but are the result of impaired renal clearance of the receptors. Indeed, we found a strong linear correlation between the levels of sTNF receptors and renal function. Nevertheless, these high levels of sTNF receptors are biological active, as they were able to bind active TNF-alpha up to 75 % (range 46 - 83 %) and thus inhibit the bioactivity and bioavailability of produced TNF-alpha. This may play a role in the <b>immunoincompetence</b> of these patients...|$|E
40|$|Human graft versus host {{disease is}} {{composed}} of 2 distinct clinical entities, acute graft versus host disease and chronic graft versus host disease, which have different pathogenesis. Acute graft versus host disease is produced by the attack of donor immunocompetent T or null lymphocytes against recipient histocompatibility antigens. The null lymphocytes may attack antigens shared by the donor and recipient and are autocytotoxic lymphocytes which can produce acute graft versus host disease in recipients of identical twin transplants. The cessation of acute graft versus host disease occurs when suppressor lymphocytes appear in the recipient's peripheral circulation. Chronic graft versus host disease is produced by immunocompetent lymphocytes that differentiate in the recipient. Its control is unknown. Some patients with chronic graft versus host disease have in vivo activated suppressor lymphocytes which produce a secondary <b>immunoincompetence</b> and an increased susceptibility to bacterial sepsis and death...|$|E

Data from the different decades were compared, but there were few major differences. Mortality rate was 22 % in the 1960 s, 25 % in the 1970 s, and 28 % in 1980 - 1982. Major management problems involved massive pulmonary hemorrhage, impaired immune defenses, old-age debility, bronchopleural fistula with empyema, or very large cavity. Anaerobic bacteria predominate and penicillin is the treatment of choice. Incidence of operation is declining, but cases are more often complicated. Prognosis is good in the uncomplicated case...|$|E
40|$|In vitro {{cellular}} immunocompetence {{was investigated}} on 35 patients with Hodgkin's disease by studying their in vitro lymphocyte responsiveness to full range stimulation achieved by {{a spectrum of}} phytohemagglutinin concentrations. When compared to the normal lymphocyte profile elicited from 35 control subjects, the Hodgkin's patterns of response enabled the identification of a quantifiable lymphocyte defect present in most patients regardless of their clinical status. Increasing severity of this defect was found with progression {{of the disease and}} was most pronounced in patients with skin anergy and absolute lymphopenia. The marked abnormality observed in patients restudied after intensive therapy returned towards normal in patients achieving a long lasting, unmaintained complete remission.

40|$|HIV-infected {{patients}} are at markedly {{increased risk for}} neurological dysfunction, which may occur at any level of the neuraxis (see Table 1). The most common syndromes- AIDS dementia complex, vacuolar myelopathy, and possibly distal symmetric peripheral neuropathy- appear {{to be related to}} HTV infection within the nervous system, rather than due to the immunoincompe-tence caused by HIV. However, the mechanism(s) by which HIV causes these syndromes, e. g., infecting neurons or oligodendroglia directly, interfering with neurotrophic factors, effecting toxic monokine production, etc., is unknown. Early, albeit incomplete, success with azido-thymidine is encouraging. Less commonly, neurological syndromes may be secondary to the <b>immunoincompetence</b> produced by HIV. Many different etiologies- most of which are treatable- have been encoun-tered, but a few of these (cerebral toxoplasmosis, cryptococcal meningitis, primary CNS lym-phoma, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy) are responsible for most of the opportunistic complications. Marked differences in symptoms and signs between AIDS patients and immunologically normal patients may complicate recognition of some of these diseases (e. g., herpes simplex encephalitis).

40|$|The {{acceptance}} of the fetal allograft {{in the face of}} a completely competent maternal immune system remains a perplexing and critical problem in transplantation immunology. Varieties of potential mechanisms by which the fetus could avoid rejection have been proposed by Medawar (1) and by Billingham (2), and these proposals set the stage for much of the work in this field. The mechanisms proposed to prevent immune destruction of the fetus by the mother have postulated roles for blocking antibodies, immunosuppressive antibody-antigen complexes, nonimmunoglobulin immunosuppressive molecules, suppressor cells, and selective maternal <b>immunoincompetence</b> (reviewed in references 3 - 8). Many of these arguments turn on the question of what type of transplantation antigens encoded by the MHC are present in the placenta. Class I antigens have been demonstrated in the placenta of the mouse (9 - 13), human (14 - 21), and rat (22 - 24) using alloantisera and mAbs. Other studies in the human showed that the placenta also carries unique class I, or class I-like, antigens, the TLX antigens (25, 26), and class I molecules that carry only broadly crossreactive publi...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies with}} chimeras of hematopoietic and lymphoid system have {{revealed}} crucial restrictions on cellular interactions and immunologic functions {{attributable to the}} major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 1 (1 - 7). Most of this work has, thus far, used models employing semi-allogeneic chimeras or chimeras in which graft-vs. -host interactions were either ongoing or a real possibility (8, 9). This has been necessary {{because of the difficulty}} of establishing long-lived chimeras between histocompatible donors and recipients across major histocompatibility barriers. When insufficient immunosuppression (e. g., radiation) is given, the donor hematopoietic grafts are rejected by classical immunologic mechanism or do not take as a consequence of allogeneic resistance (10). When sufficient immunosuppression is given, graft-vs. -host reactions (GVHR) occur that are often lethal (9). Consequently, to date, only a few fully allogeneic chimeras have been studied (9, 11 - 17). As would be predicted from studies with the semi-allogeneic chimera (1, 2), these chimeras have shown evidence of varying degrees in <b>immunoincompetence,</b> but the studies are far from complete.

40|$|Summary. -The athymic nude rat rnu/rnu {{has been}} {{established}} as an in vivo model for the acceptance of human digestive-tumour xenografts. We report the successful xenografting of 7 / 12 (58 %) primary explants from patients with digestive cancer. Successful xenografting also occurred in 21 / 25 (84 %) pancreatic tumours derived from a pancreatic exocrine adenocarcinoma (GER) maintained in cell culture; 2 of those have been successfully passaged in nude rats. The simultaneous implantation of these tumours into nude mice led to an almost identical take rate. Passage of one colonic and one pancreatic xenograft from nude rats into nude mice, and transplantation back into nude rats, increased the take rates. The critical period {{for the establishment of}} primary tumour growth was usually 28 - 42 days. The xenografts maintained histological and cytological characteristics of the primary explants or of the original tumour from which the cell line derived.

40|$|Adenovirus (Ad) {{infection}} {{has been}} identified as predisposing hosts to the development of pulmonary disease through unknown mechanisms. Lung dendritic cells (DCs) are vital for initiating pulmonary immune responses; however, the effects of Ad infection on primary lung DC have not been studied. In contrast to the effects on bone marrow- and monocyte-derived DCs, the current study shows that Ad infection of murine BALB/c lung DCs in vitro and in vivo suppresses DC-induced T-cell proliferation. The effect of Ad on DCs was not due to a downregulation of major histocompatibility complex or costimulatory molecules. Analysis of the production of interleukin- 12 (IL- 12), alpha interferon (IFN-α), and IFN-γ by the Ad-infected DCs shows no significant differences over noninfected control lung DCs. Ad-induced suppression was not due to a deficiency of IL- 2 or other DC-secreted factors and was dependent on viral protein synthesis, as UV irradiation of Ad abrogated the suppressive effect. Results suggest that Ad-infected DCs induce T cells to be nonresponsive to IL- 2 during primary coculture, as the addition of IL- 2 in secondary cultures recovered T-cell proliferation. In vivo studies supported in vitro results showing that Ad infection resulted in lung T cells with decreased proliferative ability. This study demonstrates that Ad infection induces local <b>immunoincompetence</b> by altering DC-T-cell interactions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractUmbilical {{cord blood}} (UBC) {{stem cells are}} a useful stem cell source for {{patients}} without matched related or unrelated donors. Adult transplantation with single UBC units is associated with high transplantation-related mortality (TRM). In most cases, mortality is due to infection related to slow engraftment and <b>immunoincompetence.</b> In this study, we used a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen of fludarabine, melphalan, and antithymocyte globulin followed by 2 partially matched UBC units. The UBC units were a 4 / 6 HLA match or better {{with each other and}} with the patient and achieved a minimum precryopreservation cell dose of 3. 7 × 107 nucleated cells/kg. A total of 21 patients (median age, 49 years) were treated. The median time to an absolute neutrophil count > 0. 5 × 109 /L was 20 days, and the median time to an unsupported platelet count > 20 × 109 /L was 41 days. Two patients experienced primary graft failure and underwent a second UBC transplantation. One patient had a late graft failure. Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grade II-IV occurred in 40 % of patients. The 100 -day TRM was 14 %, and the 1 -year disease-free survival was 67 %. Mixed chimerism was associated with a higher risk of chronic GVHD. Our findings indicate that adult patients can tolerate double UBC transplantation well and achieve sustained antitumor responses using this reduced-intensity conditioning regimen...|$|E
40|$|In {{these studies}} we have {{determined}} the molecular weights of B cell growth factor (BCGF) (less than 20, 000), and B cell differentiation factors (BCDF) that induce immunoglobulin M (IgM) secretion (BCDF mu) (30 - 60, 000) and IgG secretion (BCDF gamma) (less than 20, 000). Thus, the molecular weight of BCDF mu {{is distinct from}} that of BCGF and BCDF gamma; BCGF and BCDF gamma cannot be distinguished. In addition, BCGF, BCDF mu, and BCDF gamma are distinguishable by their presence or absence in different supernatants from a panel of mitogen-induced T cell clones. These {{results suggest that the}} three lymphokines are different. This conclusion is supported by their differential biological effect on B cells from adult and neonatal mice. Thus, treatment with anti-Ig induces B cells from adult mice to proliferate and this proliferation is sustained by BCGF. In contrast, even in the presence of BCGF, anti-Ig does not induce B cells from neonatal mice to proliferate. However, BCDF mu and BCDF gamma induce IgM and IgG secretion in B cells, respectively, from both adult and neonatal mice. Thus, mature B cells can both clonally expand and differentiate in response to anti-Ig, BCGF, and BCDF, whereas immature B cells can only differentiate. The poor response of neonatal B cells to anti-Ig and BCGF may partially explain the relative <b>immunoincompetence</b> of immature B cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{acquired}} immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is {{a devastating}} new disease caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This retrovirus causes profound <b>immunoincompetence</b> in its infected hosts, who are thereafter susceptible to develop myriad severe and relapsing protozoal, fungal, bacterial, viral, and arthropodal opportunistic infections, as well as unusual malignancies. The more than 50, 000 patients who have developed AIDS in the United States have produced a sudden unexpected deluge of diagnostic dilemmas that are stressing laboratories of pathology everywhere.

These receptors constitute {{key players in}} the induction of inflammation, e. g. in septic or chronic inflammatory diseases. Colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) such as granulocyte-macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF) or granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF) have been extensively investigated in their capacity to promote myelopoiesis in febrile neutropenia or to overcome immunosuppression in patients suffering from sepsis-associated neutropenia or from monocytic <b>immunoincompetence.</b> We report here that GM-CSF, downregulates TLR 1, TLR 2 and TLR 4 in a time- and dose-dependent fashion in human monocytes. Diminished pathogen recognition receptor expression was accompanied by reduced downstream p 38 and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling upon lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding-and accordingly led to impaired proinflammatory cytokine production. Knockdown experiments of the transcription factors PU. 1 and VentX showed that GM-CSF driven effects on TLR regulation is entirely PU. 1 but not VentX dependent. We further analysed monocyte TLR and CD 14 expression upon exposure to the IMID® immunomodulatory drug Pomalidomide (CC- 4047), a Thalidomide analogue known to downregulate PU. 1. Indeed, Pomalidomide in part reversed the GM-CSF-mediated effects. Our data indicate a critical role of PU. 1 in the regulation of TLR 1, 2, 4 and of CD 14, thus targeting PU. 1 ultimately results in TLR modulation. The PU. 1 mediated immunomodulatory properties of GM-CSF should be taken into consideration upon usage of GM-CSF in inflammatory or infection-related conditions...|$|E

The principal {{manifestations of the}} disease include thrombocytopaenia, intravascular fibrin deposits, intestinal haemorrhage, hepatic infarcts, lymphosplenomegaly and renal disease. Immune complexes {{have been shown to}} be the cause of the renal lesions, and have been implicated as the triggers for disseminated intravascular coagulation. In the present studies of RFM mice perinatally inoculated with (T 6 x RFM) F 1 spleen cells (RFM/(T 6 x RFM) F 1 mice), quantitative determinations of serum immunoglobulins (Ig) revealed marked elevations of IgG 1, IgG 2, IgA and IgM. Electrophoretic analyses revealed the polyclonal pattern which typically follows chronic antigenic stimulation. However, IgG 1 levels which reached 29 to 72 times control values suggested disruption of homeostatic mechanisms which control circulating Ig levels. Because antibody responses to histocompatibility antigens were present only occasionally, and then in low titre, it seemed unlikely these antigens were the principal causes of hypergammaglobulinaemia and plasmacytosis. Morphological studies indicated that the elevated levels of Ig seen in end-stage HVG syndrome correlated well with marked plasmacytosis, the third morphological finding in a sequence that included the precocious development of germinal centres and subsequent depletion of thymic-dependent (T) lymphocytes. The fact that spleen cells from RFM/(T 6 x RFM) F 1 mice were severely impaired in their capacity to cause graft versus host disease in related (T 6 x RFM) F 1 and unrelated C 3 H mice provided strong evidence that the HVG reaction resulted in T-cell depletion, rather than specific <b>immunoincompetence...</b>|$|E

Mice of the C 57 BL/ 6 and HA/ICR strains were susceptible, and those of A/He, AKR, BALB/c, CBA, C 3 H/Anf, and DBA/ 2 strains were resistant to coccidial infection. Resistance was a dominant genetic expression, as indicated by the resistant response of F 1 hybrids of susceptible C 57 BL/ 6 and resistant CBA, C 3 H/Anf, or DBA/ 2 strains. An E. ferrisi infection in congenitally athymic nu/nu mice and phenotypically normal heterozygous nu/+ mice was used to determine how thymus-dependent <b>immunoincompetence</b> in cell-mediated immunity of the nu/nu mouse affected resistance to infection in a genetic background of the resistant BALB/c mouse. Results of primary and challenge infections in these two strains of mice suggested that resistance is thymus dependent. Furthermore, impairment of thymus-dependent cell-mediated immunity in resistant AKR mice by treatment with mouse antithymus serum led to partial susceptibility. However, susceptible C 57 BL/ 6 and HA/ICR strains are phenotypically normal mice, and previous evidence showed that C 57 BL/ 6 mice are not completely immunoincompetent in cell-mediated reactivity to coccidia. Collectively, our data show that cell-mediated immunity is necessary for resistance but may be subjected to modification by genetic expression of the host.

40|$|Introduction Despite {{engraftment}} {{and function}} of graft after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation severe immune suppression is a characteristic of early posttransplant period. Primary parameters contributing to posttransplant <b>immunoincompetence</b> include: lack of sustained transfer of donor antigen specific immunity, recapitulation of immunological ontogeny effect of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and its therapy and reduction of the recipient's thymic function. Normal immune reconstitution following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) Immune reconstitution following allogeneic HSCT depends on the age of recipient initial pathology, degree of HLA and minor histocompatibility antigen mismatches, T-cell depletion and use of anti-T-cell antibodies for conditioning and prevention of GvHD, posttransplant complications such as acute and chronic GvHD, relapse of disease and infectious status of the donor and recipient prior to transplantation. Tests for studying immune reconstitution following allogeneic transplantation most often used are cutaneous tests of delayed hypersensitivity, phenotyping of blood mononuclear cells and investigation of their functions, production of antibodies (IgG, IgM and IgA) and cytokines such as IL- 2, TGF-a, TNF-a or IL- 10, study of TCR, mixed leukocyte reaction toward allogeneic cells CD 4 /CD 8 ratio and others. New tools for assessment of immune reconstitution after HSCT New methods and techniques for monitoring immune reconstitution are as follows: ELISPOT assay quantifies secretion of cytokines by T lymphocytes, analysis of the T-cell receptor (chain diversity during immune reconstitution by IMMUNOSCOPE/SPECTRATYPING method, and TREC technology that detects recent thymic emigrants in peripheral blood.

40|$|Inoculation of immunocompetent {{lymphoid cells}} into aUogeneic or semisyngeneic Ft {{recipient}} mice {{can lead to}} graft vs. host (GvH) 1 reactions (1 - 3). In the induction phase of the GvH the injected lymphocytes recognize and respond to foreign alloantigens expressed by recipient cells (4). Such recognition can result in the generation of a cytotoxic effector T lymphocyte (CTL) response against the host cells that {{may be associated with}} the characteristic symptoms of GvH disease (4 - 6). Other facets of GvH reactivity are the production of autoantibodies and the development of severe <b>immunoincompetence</b> (7). It has also been shown that the injection of parental spleen cells into unirradiated F 1 hybrid mice results in reduction or abrogation of the capability to generate a cytotoxic T cell response in vitro (8). This lack of immune responsiveness could be accounted for by at least two possible suppressive mechanisms: (a) activation of parent-anti-F 1 allogeneic CTL; and (b) activation of a noncytotoxic Ft suppressor population resulting from parent-anti-F 1 recognition (9). Earlier reports indicated that GvH reactivity as detected by splenomegaly and mortality could be prevented or reduced by injecting F 1 mice with alloantisera (10, 11) i In the present study we have attempted to protect F 1 hybrid mice from the induction of GvH-associated suppression of the CTL response by injecting Fl mice with alloantibodies before inoculation of parental spleen cells. The results described here indicate that alloantiserum directed against either parental haplotype of the F 1 as well as certain monoclonal antibodies against H- 2 or Ia antigens of the F ~ host prevented the induction of GvH-associated CTL suppression.

If biphasic plots are assumed, the two linear components show markedly diminished receptor capacity (15 and 137 ng/ 106 lymphocytes) in CLL {{as compared to}} controls (60 and 668 ng). In contrast, affinity was similar in patients (1. 0 × 108 M− 1 and 2. 1 × 106 M− 1) and controls (1. 8 × 108 M− 1 and 1. 5 × 106 M− 1). Highly purified B cells from patients and controls generated binding data comparable to that obtained from the mixed lymphocyte (ML) suspensions from which they originated. Maximal DNA synthesis of highly purified, normal, thymus-derived (T) and B cells in response to LPHA stimulation was {{comparable to that of}} ML (mitotic index [MI] 19. 9, 20. 1, and 23. 4, respectively), though B-cell responses were slightly delayed. In CLL the markedly decreased and delayed DNA synthesis by ML (MI 2. 3), and by highly purified T (MI 1. 6) and B (MI 1. 9) cells seemed out of proportion to their decreased receptor capacity for LPHA. The impaired mitogenic responses of leukemic cells from five patients were not enhanced when cocultured with normal lymphocytes. In contrast, cells from eight patients inhibited cocultured normal lymphocyte responses to LPHA by 94. 3 %. Sera from these patients and supernates from their cultured cells did not mediate this suppressor effect. These observations indicate that the decreased DNA synthesis observed in CLL is not an attribute of B cells and does not represent the expected response of a few residual normal T lymphocytes, but rather reflects impaired responses by all CLL cells. The defect does not relate to the density or function of membrane receptors for LPHA, to the presence of inhibitors in these patients' sera, or to depletion of helper T cells.

40|$|The human {{monocyte}} (M phi subset rosetting with anti RH-coated human erythrocytes via high-affinity, 72 kD receptors (FcRI+), {{contains the}} PGE 2 -producing immunosuppressive subpopulation, while the non-rosetting M phi subset (FcRI-) {{is the major}} plasminogen activator-producing and antigen-presenting M phi. This study gives additional evidence for the functional disparity of the FcRI- and FcRI+ M phi subsets. We are demonstrating that the normal human M phi subset isolated by rosetting via the FcRI receptor (FcRI+) produces greater quantities of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) than the non-rosetting (FcRI-) M phi. TNF production by the FcRI+ M phi subset is {{greater than that of}} the FcRI- M phi subset whether secreted (P less than. 001) or cell-associated (P less than. 001) TNF is assessed. The rosetting M phi subset that expresses high densities of FcRI (FcRI+) produced the majority of normal human peripheral blood M phi TNF whether the stimulation was an interferon gamma (IFN gamma) prime followed by MDP or followed by interleukin- 2 (IL- 2). The Fc rosetting technique itself resulted in some TNF induction in the FcRI+ M phi subset accounting for some of the increased TNF production of this subset. However, increasing the stimulation level of the FcRI very-low-density (FcRI-) M phi subset did not induce it to produce TNF levels equivalent to the moderately stimulated FcRI+ M phi subset. These data, therefore, imply that only stimulation through the type I Fc gamma receptor can augment or induce TNF activity. The difference in the M phi subset 2 ̆ 7 s TNF response remained even after the FcRI- M phi subset received a 2. 5 -fold increase in stimulation with the classical M phi induction regimen of IFN gamma plus bacterial cell wall product. Although stimulation of the FcRI+ M phi subset via crosslinking of their FcRI receptors might represent a unique TNF stimulation pathway, this stimulation does not occur in the low-density FcRI (FcRI-) M phi subset, again indicating functional disparity between these subsets. Greater TNF production by the FcRI+ M phi subset was induced concomitant to elevation of its prostaglandin E 2 production. Since both TNF and PGE 2 are increased in some patient groups, a pathological shift in the FcRI+ versus FcRI- M phi ratio in these patients coupled to the functional differences in FcRI+ and FcRI- M phi subsets could be one mechanism for the development of <b>immunoincompetence...</b>|$|E

Clinical characteristics, causes of death, therapies, response to treatment, disease specific survival and overall survival were recorded and in a second step age, sex, stage of disease, treatment and response to treatment was correlated with survival, to examine these in terms of their possible prognostic value. The mean age at disease onset was 64. 9 years. The mean age at disease onset was 63. 9 years in men, which was an average of 2. 3 years before the onset in women. The proportion of men was 59. 1 %. At the timepoint of primary diagnosis of the Sézary syndrome, 11 patients (50 %) were in stage IVA 1 disease, five patients (23 %) were in stage IVA 2 disease and six patients (27 %) had stage IVB disease. Out of the 17 patients who had died because of the Sézary syndrome, 70 % died because of fatal infection following severe <b>immunoincompetence,</b> 12 % had developed metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and 18 % of patients had died from a liver or kidney failure during progressive disease of the Sézary syndrome. The average overall survival time in the collective of the Dermatology Department in Minden was 3. 6 years, the mean disease specific survival time was 3. 7 years, the five-year overall survival rate was 28. 6 %, the disease specific five-year survival rate was 23. 5 %. Age, sex, therapy and disease stage at the time of diagnosis were statistically tested with respect to survival, but no statistically significant correlation could be identified. The subgroup of patients with progressive disease after three months of therapy had a 38 % less overall survival time compared to the remaining patients. Patients with progressive disease after six months of therapy had a 51 % lower disease-specific survival time. There were indications that a progressive disease which was found after six months of therapy could be more strongly associated with a lower overall survival than the finding of a progressive disease after three months of therapy. However, no statistical significance was found for this hypothesis in the present series of the Dermatology Department in Minden...|$|E
40|$|Liver {{transplantation}} (LT) for unresectable locally advanced primary liver tumours (aPLT) {{is associated}} with an inferior survival compared to other established indications. As organ shortage in most regions is the major factor limiting the transplant rate, a careful selection of patients accepted for LT is necessary. Thus, the majority of patients with aPLT's will not be considered for LT even though {{a significant proportion of}} them may benefit from the procedure. The {{purpose of this study was}} to find ways to optimise the selection criteria for LT to a Scandinavian population of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to explore the effect of adjuvant treatment on hepatic malignancies. In the first study we performed a retrospective evaluation of our own series of patients (n = 55) with. cirrhosis and HCC that have undergone LT. Two-third of the patients did not meet the standard selection criteria defined as single tumour 3 em. We found that the number of nodules, the histological grade and the cold ischemia time all were independent risk factors for recurrence. To identify patients with an acceptable prognosis after LT, we hypothetically tested what the outcome would have been if a modification of the standard selection criteria (5 2 tumours with total tumour diameter < 10 em) had been applied for these patients. We found that, although these criteria were less restrictive, the recurrence rate in that group was identical (28 %) to the group that met the standard criteria. The effect of adjuvant systemic chemotherapy after LT is not thoroughly investigated. We have studied the effect of adriamycin with or without cyclosporine A (CsA) on chemically induced rat hepatomas transferred to the spleens of a syngenic rat strain. We found that the tumour morphology was of utmost importance for the outcome. In poorly differentiated tumours, adriamycin exerted growth inhibition as expected, although partly counteracted by CsA. However, when the tumour exhibited less nuclear dysplasia, adriamycin in combination with. CsA paradoxically stimulated tumour growth. As a next step we conducted a randomised controlled trial with neoadjuvant systemic adriamycin in patients with HCC. Forty-two patients were randomised to receive either low weekly doses of adriamycin or no additional treatment. No significant effect on 3 -year over all survival, disease-free survival or freedom from recurrence could be seen. There was a poor tolerability to the drug reflected by the fact that only 11 / 17 patients in the chemo group received more than half of the prescheduled doses. Powerful anti-leukaemia effects can be seen after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In order to explore if there is a corresponding effect on residual malignant Ever tumour cells (GVTeffect) after LT in patients with aPLT's, the next part of the study was carried out. First we developed a method for harvest and procurement of bone marrow from cadaveric donors. We found that the optimal source for harvest was the vertebral column and that sufficient amount of stem cells with good viability and functionality for transplantation could he obtained from 10 vertebraes. Subsequently, one patient with advanced HCC underwent combined liver- and bone marrow transplantation. The bone marrow was harvested together with the fiver from the same cadaveric donor (CD) and there was a major human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatch between the donor and recipient. In spite of an initial successful engraftment of the donor marrow, it was not possible to obtain stable mixed chimerism, and the patient died five months after HSCT due to severe <b>immunoincompetence.</b> The protocol was after this modified so that instead of CD's and myeloablative HSCT, HLA-matched live donors were used for a nonmyeloablative HSCT post LT. Five patients that have undergone this procedure are reported and we found that the concept is feasible with. low transplant-related mortality (TRM). However, 315 patients rejected their stem cell grafts and we suggest that an augmented pre-treatment is necessary. The effect of the concept on survival has yet to be proven. In conclusion, HCC consisting of less than 3 nodules and with a total diameter < 10 em can be treated with LT alone with an acceptable recurrence rate. Based on experimental data, (neo) adjuvant treatment with adriamycin may be hazardous and does not prolong survival after LT in the clinical setting. In order to achieve a potential GVT-effect, bone marrow can be harvested together with the liver and transplanted as adjuvant treatment in spite of a major HLA-mismatch. However, due to high risk for TRM, an approach with combined LT + HLAmatched HSCT is safer and a refined version of the original protocol is presently used...|$|E
