5|$|For a time, Mary Shelley found comfort only in her writing. The {{birth of}} her fourth child, Percy Florence, on 12 November 1819, finally lifted her spirits, though she nursed {{the memory of her}} lost {{children}} till the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E

5|$|Singh {{eventually}} {{received a}} place of honour in the suffragette movement alongside Emmeline Pankhurst. Her sole aim in life, which she attained, was the advancement of women. Queen Victoria had given Singh an elaborately-dressed doll named Little Sophie, which became her proud possession. Near the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>life</b> she gave the doll to Drovna, her housekeeper's daughter.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 118, over {{a period}} of six months, she was {{submitted}} to neurophysiological tests and a CT scan. The tests showed that her verbal memory and language fluency was comparable to that of persons with the same level of education in their eighties and nineties. Frontal brain lobe functions were relatively spared from deterioration and {{there was no evidence of}} progressive neurological disease, depressive symptoms or other functional illness. Her cognitive functioning was in fact found to improve slightly over the six-month period. Calment reportedly remained mentally intact until the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1892, Baeyertz {{returned}} to the United Kingdom, preaching and conducting missions in Ireland, Scotland, and England. There she would preach to packed halls, sometimes to just women, earning £43 in a fortnight (worth about £17,000 in 2014). She remained in her London base until 1904, when she {{returned to}} Australia. Emilia arrived in Perth in May 1904, remaining there for a year before returning to Victoria. Towards the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>life,</b> she returned to England. She conducted a few missions before her death on 26 April 1926 in Surrey.|$|E

5|$|In 1948, feeling {{threatened}} by Joseph Stalin's regime, Olga emigrated with her immediate family to {{a farm in}} Ontario, Canada. With advancing age, Olga and her husband moved to a bungalow near Cooksville, Ontario. Colonel Kulikovsky died there in 1958. Two years later, as her health deteriorated, Olga moved with devoted friends to a small apartment in East Toronto. She died aged 78, seven months after her older sister, Xenia. At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>life</b> and afterwards, Olga was widely labeled the last Grand Duchess of Imperial Russia.|$|E
5|$|In later life, she {{eventually}} adopted more conventional behaviour, took up pious works and even reformed the convent that became her second {{residence in the}} Paris suburbs. As {{the years went by}} she suffered serious setbacks to her health and the sadness of mourning her eldest son, Grand Prince Ferdinando, for whom she had had a genuine affection. Rendered financially independent by a legacy, she purchased a house in Paris, from which she spent the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>life</b> dispensing charity and keeping up dignified correspondence.|$|E
5|$|Mary met {{her husband}} in Zagreb on 4July. She officially {{remained}} Sigismund's co-ruler until the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>life,</b> but her influence on government was minimal. Sigismund's land grants were always confirmed with Mary's own great seal {{during the first year}} of their common rule, but thereafter the grantees rarely sought her confirmation. Royal charters counted her regnal years not from her ascension, but from her husband's coronation. Nevertheless, Mary persuaded her husband to torture and execute John Horvat who was captured in July 1394 although Sigismund would have been willing to spare his life.|$|E

5|$|Mary Ochsenhirt Amdur (February 18, 1921 – February 16, 1998) was an American {{toxicologist}} {{and public}} health researcher who worked primarily on pollution. She was charged with studying {{the effects of the}} 1948 Donora smog, so she specifically looked into the effects of inhaling Sulfuric acid by experimenting on guinea pigs. Her findings on the respiratory effects related to sulfuric acid led to her being threatened, to her funding being pulled, and to her losing her job at the Harvard School of Public Health in 1953. Undeterred by the setback, she carried on her research in a different role at Harvard, and subsequently at MIT and New York University. Despite the early controversy related to her work, it was used in the creation of standards in air pollution, and towards the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>life</b> she received numerous awards and accolades.|$|E
5|$|After the Nuremberg rallies trilogy and Olympia, Riefenstahl {{began work}} on the movie she had {{tried and failed to}} direct once before, namely Tiefland. On Hitler's direct order, the German {{government}} paid her seven million Reichsmarks in compensation. From 23 September until 13 November 1940, she filmed in Krün near Mittenwald. The extras playing Spanish women and farmers were drawn from gypsies detained in a camp at Salzburg-Maxglan who were forced to work with her. Filming at the Babelsberg Studios near Berlin began 18 months later in April 1942. This time Sinti and Roma people from the Marzahn detention camp near Berlin were compelled to work as extras. Almost to the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>life,</b> despite overwhelming evidence that the concentration camp occupants had been forced to work on the movie unpaid, Riefenstahl continued to maintain all the film extras survived and that she had met several of them after the war. Riefenstahl sued filmmaker Nina Gladitz, who said Riefenstahl personally chose the extras at their holding camp; Gladitz had found one of the Gypsy survivors and matched his memory with stills of the movie for a documentary Gladitz was filming. The German court ruled largely in favour of Gladitz, declaring that Riefenstahl had known the extras were from a concentration camp, but they also agreed that Riefenstahl had not been informed the Gypsies would be sent to Auschwitz after filming was completed.|$|E
5|$|Despite her predicament, Sánchez {{remained}} relatively positive: she sang to Germán Santa María Barragán, {{a journalist who}} {{was working as a}} volunteer, asked for sweet food, drank soda, and agreed to be interviewed. At times, she was scared, and prayed or cried. On the third night, Sánchez began hallucinating, saying that {{she did not want to}} be late for school, and mentioned a maths exam. Near the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>life,</b> Sánchez's eyes reddened, her face swelled, and her hands whitened. At one point she asked the people to leave her so they could rest. Hours later the workers returned with a pump and tried to save her, but her legs were bent under the concrete as if she was kneeling, and it was impossible to free her without severing her legs. Lacking the surgical equipment to save her from the effects of an amputation, the doctors present agreed that it would be more humane to let her die. In all, Sánchez suffered for nearly three nights (roughly 60 hours) before she died at approximately 10:05 A.M. on November 16 from exposure, most likely from gangrene or hypothermia.|$|E

5|$|While {{some parts}} of the book were inventions, she also made use of real-life incidents. The opening chapter of The Danger Tree {{describes}} the accidental death of the young son of Sir Desmond and Lady Hooper. The incident was based on fact: Sir Walter and Lady Amy Smart's eight-year-old boy was killed when he picked up a stick bomb while on a desert picnic in January 1943. Just as described in the novel, his grief-stricken parents had tried to feed the dead boy through a hole in his cheek. Manning had long been resentful at the Smarts' failure to include her and Reggie in their artistic circle in Cairo. However, the scene was considered in poor taste even by Manning's friends, who were also outraged that the quiet and faithful Lady Smart was associated with Manning's very different Lady Hooper. Though both Sir Walter and his wife had died by the time of publication, Manning's publisher received a solicitor's letter written on behalf of the Smart family, objecting to the scene and requiring {{that there should be no}} further reference to the incident or to the couple in future volumes. Manning ignored both requests. She based the character of Aidan Pratt on the actor, writer and poet Stephen Haggard, whom she had known in Jerusalem. Like Pratt, Haggard committed suicide on a train from Cairo to Palestine, but in Haggard's case it followed the end of a relationship with a beautiful Egyptian woman, rather than unrequited homosexual love. After years of complaints about her publisher Heinemann, Manning moved to Weidenfeld & Nicolson, and remained with them until the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>life.</b> The Danger Tree was a considerable critical success, and though Manning was disappointed yet again that her novel was not shortlisted for the Booker prize, the Yorkshire Post selected it as their Best Novel of 1977. This award followed her 1976 appointment to the Order of the British Empire.|$|E
