25|$|Ian Yeowart, former Managing Director of Grand Central, {{put forward}} in 2009 {{a bid for}} new open access Alliance Rail {{services}} operating on the East Coast Main Line. As part of the scheme, four services a day would operate between Sheffield and London King’s Cross via Alfreton, Nottingham and Grantham, meaning Sheffield would {{be connected to the}} capital by both the Midland Main Line and the East Coast Main Line routes once again. Yeowart has proposed the resurrection of the name GNER for the service, which has been unused since the last franchise of that name ended in 2007. However, in 2010 these proposed Sheffield to London Kings Cross services via the East Coast Main Line were rejected. In the 2010 Rail Utilisation Strategy, it quoted that the Midland Main Line north of Bedford will be electrified in 2020. The line is currently one of the few major main lines (along with the Great Western Main Line that is not electrified west of Hayes and Harlington) and the plan found that the project would provide significantly <b>enhanced</b> <b>services</b> and significant financial savings.|$|E

5000|$|Today's {{wireless}} subscribers {{are much}} more sophisticated telecommunications users than they were five years ago. No longer satisfied with just completing a clear call, today's subscribers demand innovative ways to use the wireless phone. They want multiple services {{that allow them to}} handle or select incoming calls in a variety of ways. <b>Enhanced</b> <b>services</b> are very important to wireless customers. They have come to expect, for instance, services such as caller ID and voice messaging bundled in the package when they buy and activate a cellular or personal communications service (PCS) phone. Whether prepaid, voice/data messaging, Internet surfing, or location-sensitive billing, <b>enhanced</b> <b>services</b> will become an important differentiator in an already crowded, competitive service-provider market. <b>Enhanced</b> <b>services</b> will also entice potentially new subscribers to sign up for service and will drive up airtime through increased usage of PCS or cellular services. As the wireless market becomes increasingly competitive, rapid deployment of <b>enhanced</b> <b>services</b> becomes critical to a successful wireless strategy.|$|E
