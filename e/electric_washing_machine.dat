5000|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century, {{commercial}} laundries began using steam-powered mangles or ironers. Gradually, the <b>electric</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machine's</b> spin cycle rendered this use of a mangle obsolete, and with it the need to wring out water from clothes mechanically. Box mangles were large and primarily intended for pressing laundry smooth; they were used by wealthy households, large commercial laundries, and self-employed [...] "mangle women". Middle-class households and independent washerwomen used upright mangles for wringing water out of laundry, and in the later 19th century they were more widely used than early <b>washing</b> <b>machines.</b> The rollers were typically made of wood, or sometimes rubber.|$|R
50|$|In the UK {{and in most}} of Europe, <b>electric</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> did {{not become}} popular until the 1950s. This was {{largely because of the}} {{economic}} impact of World War II on the consumer market, which did not properly recover until the late 1950s. The early electric washers were single-tub, wringer-type machines, as fully automatic <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> were extremely expensive. During the 1960s, twin tub machines briefly became very popular, helped by the low price of the Rolls Razor washers. Some machines had the ability to pump used wash water into a separate tub for temporary storage, and to later pump it back for re-use. This was done not to save water or soap, but because heated water was expensive and time-consuming to produce. Automatic <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> did not become dominant in the UK until well into the 1970s and by then were almost exclusively of the front-loader design.|$|R

50|$|Many Japanese {{houses were}} {{destroyed}} in World War II. Rebuilding allowed architects to freely redesign houses {{as well as}} kitchens. The influence of Edo-period lifestyles was now nearly gone. Electricity and gas were built into kitchens, and designs reflected this change.

However, early post-war housing projects were often poorly designed. Sometimes architects simply copied plans for American or European housing projects, with only minor modifications to better suit Japanese families.

40|$|This {{study is}} part of a {{technical}} support contract signed between DG Environment and DG Joint Research Centre, regarding Environmental Footprinting, material efficiency in product policy and the European Platform on LCA (2013 - 2017). In particular, Task and Deliverable 8 are entitled “Develop/test potentially standardized method on material efficiency, to be applied to relevant product groups” and aim at developing feasibility studies on potentially standardized methods for assessing durability of products. The main objective of this report consists of outlining and testing a procedure for assessing durability of <b>electric</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> for household use. In particular the report will: •	investigate existing endurance tests, •	define whether such endurance tests can be suitable for a possible standardised testing procedure, •	develop and test a durability procedure on exemplary <b>washing</b> <b>machines,</b> and •	assess the durability procedure and provide guidelines for future development. Chapters 2 and 3 of the present report concern I) a literature review, with a focus {{on the state of the}} art of <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> durability, the average usage in Europe, frequent failure modes and different existing theories behind durability tests; II) the study of existing international standards, currently dealing with safety of electronic devices and household appliances, endurance requirements for <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> parts and guidelines to assess the performance during the washing cycle; III) comments and feedback from experts that were contacted during the study in order to gather information about tests, non-disclosed procedures, failure mode statistics and possible answers to the question of methods able to measure or to verify durability. Chapter 4 provides the scientific background about the dynamics of a horizontal axis <b>washing</b> <b>machine,</b> which can be seen physically as a vibrating system where the tub (including the drum) is fixed with springs on the top of the housing. Finally, a novel procedure for durability testing is proposed in chapter 5.

50|$|By August 1960, 9 out of 10 urban {{households}} had a radio, {{almost half}} had an <b>electric</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> and an electric fan, {{and more than}} half had a television set. By the late Seventies, however, 99.4% of all households had refrigerators, 98.7% owned washing machines, 97.7% had colour television sets, and 53.4% possessed motor cars. By the early 1980s, most Japanese enjoyed to “to the full the fact that they possessed amenities and advantages befitting a society as advanced as any on Earth.” The annual income of the average Japanese family had increased to $20,000, about 40% of all homes were equipped with microwave ovens or air conditioners, more than 8 out of 10 families had electric sewing machines, 2 out of 3 families owned a passenger car and at least one tape recorder, and more than 99% of all households contained colour television sets and refrigerators. By the mid-1980s, Japanese real wages were estimated to be at least 60% to 80% of real wages in the United States. Some 90% of Japanese came to regard themselves as middle class, and Japanese workers had come to be regarded as amongst the best paid in the world. According to International Labour Organization statistics, Japanese workers in manufacturing in 1984 earned an average of $989.99 per hour. In addition, according to a 1989 study on Japanese society, a comparison based on the (then) current value of the yen revealed that Japanese workers were now earning more per hour than their American counterparts.|$|E
