5|$|As {{a general}} rule, {{there is no}} {{requirement}} for particular formalities in trust instruments, they can be oral or written.

5|$|Cardinals who {{simultaneously}} {{were also}} bishops usually {{appear in the}} documents with both titles: cardinalitial and episcopal.

5|$|Prior to 1998, Victoria County {{contained}} twelve King's Highways. As {{part of a}} province-wide {{transfer of}} highways to municipal governments, known as downloading, seven were given new Victoria County designations following the prior provincial designations.

5|$|The {{flowers of}} Schlumbergera have adaptations for {{pollination}} by hummingbirds: tubular flowers with abundant nectar, and colours towards the red {{end of the}} spectrum.

The <b>exceptions</b> <b>are</b> S. kautskyi and S. microsphaerica; as noted above, the latter is found at higher altitudes where humming birds may be absent or less common.|$|E
50|$|In 2014 a new <b>exception</b> <b>was</b> {{introduced}} (Section 29A) {{to allow}} web mining, text mining and data mining. Because of the Copyright Directive however {{the use of}} this <b>exception</b> <b>is</b> limited to non-commercial research only.|$|R

2500|$|Software {{exception}} handling {{and the support}} provided by software tools differs somewhat from what <b>is</b> understood under <b>exception</b> in hardware, but similar concepts are involved. In programming language mechanisms for {{exception handling}}, the term <b>exception</b> <b>is</b> typically used in a specific sense to denote a data structure storing information about an exceptional condition. One mechanism to transfer control, or raise an <b>exception,</b> <b>is</b> known as a throw. The <b>exception</b> <b>is</b> said to be thrown. Execution is transferred to a [...] "catch".|$|R

The <b>exceptions</b> <b>are</b> the manatee and the two-toed sloth, which have just six, and the three-toed sloth which has nine cervical vertebrae. All mammalian brains possess a neocortex, a brain region unique to mammals. Placental mammals have a corpus callosum, unlike monotremes and marsupials.|$|E
5|$|The {{sovereign}} wears {{a variety}} of different robes and other garments {{during the course of the}} ceremony. In contrast to the history and tradition which surround the regalia, it is customary for most coronation robes to be newly made for each monarch.

5|$|The {{value of}} a {{quantity}} is written as a number followed by a space (representing a multiplication sign) and a unit symbol; e.g., 2.21kg, , 22K. This rule explicitly includes the percent sign (%) and the symbol for degrees of temperature (°C). <b>Exceptions</b> <b>are</b> the symbols for plane angular degrees, minutes, and seconds (°,, and), which are placed immediately after the number with no intervening space.|$|E

2500|$|If an <b>exception</b> <b>is</b> thrown and {{not caught}} (operationally, an <b>exception</b> <b>is</b> thrown {{when there is}} no {{applicable}} handler specified), the uncaught <b>exception</b> <b>is</b> handled by the runtime; the routine that does this is called the [...] The most common default behavior is to terminate the program and print an error message to the console, usually including debug information such as a string representation of the exception and the stack trace. This is often avoided by having a top-level (application-level) handler (for example in an event loop) that catches exceptions before they reach the runtime.|$|R
5000|$|If no [...] block {{matches the}} type of the thrown exception, the {{execution}} of the outer block (or method) containing the ... statement is discontinued, and the <b>exception</b> <b>is</b> passed up and outside the containing block (or method). The <b>exception</b> <b>is</b> propagated upwards through the call stack until a matching [...] block is found within one of the currently active methods.

5|$|These {{operations}} {{define a}} symmetry relation between equivalent grids. Excluding relabeling, and {{with respect to}} the 81 grid cell values, the operations form a subgroup of the symmetric group S81, of order 3!8×2=3,359,232. Applying the above operations on majority of the grids results in 3!8×2×9! essentially equivalent grids. <b>Exceptions</b> <b>are</b> Automorphic Sudokus which due to additional non-trivial symmetry generate fewer grids.|$|E
5|$|Excavations of Iron Age {{sites have}} {{recovered}} horse bones from ritual pits at a temple site near Cambridge, and around twenty Iron Age chariot burials have been found, {{including one of}} a woman discovered at Wetwang Slack. The majority of Iron Age chariot burials in Britain {{are associated with the}} Arras culture, and in most cases the chariots were dismantled before burial. <b>Exceptions</b> <b>are</b> the Ferrybridge and Newbridge chariots, which are the only ones found to have been buried intact. The Newbridge burial has been radiocarbon dated to 520–370BC, and the Ferrybridge burial is likely to be of similar date.|$|E
5|$|Gambling {{and related}} paraphernalia, broadly defined by ABC to include claw and crane machines, casino-themed video games, {{football}} pools, and door prizes, irrespective of whether any profit {{is being made}} by the business, are prohibited at licensed establishments. The only <b>exceptions</b> <b>are</b> for those bars licensed {{by the state to}} sell lottery tickets or have off-track betting on horse racing. Charity bingo games or raffles are also allowed. Card games, darts, billiards and other games are permitted as long as no money is exchanged, and no prizes are given.|$|E

5|$|Individually, {{each game}} in the series has been {{generally}} well received. In 1995, Dark Forces became LucasArts' highest sell-in with more than 300,000 copies accounted for at launch. Games in the series have achieved consistently favorable review scores from most publications, and hold high aggregate scores on both Metacritic and GameRankings. The only <b>exceptions</b> <b>are</b> the PlayStation version of Dark Forces, which was perceived to have graphical problems and the GameCube version of Jedi Outcast, which was seen as considerably inferior to the PC and Xbox versions.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{can form}} {{multiply}} bonded chains, a property it shares with its lighter homolog, carbon. Its {{capacity to do}} so is much less because the Pb–Pb bond energy is over three and a half times lower than that of the C–C bond. With itself lead can build metal–metal bonds of an order up to three. With carbon, lead forms organolead compounds similar to, but generally less stable than, typical organic compounds (due to the Pb–C bond being rather weak). This makes the organometallic chemistry of lead far less wide-ranging than that of tin. It predominantly forms organolead(IV) compounds, even when starting with inorganic lead(II) reactants; very few organolead(II) compounds are known. The most well-characterized <b>exceptions</b> <b>are</b> Pb2 and Pb(η5-C5H5)2.|$|E
5|$|Lead is a {{relatively}} unreactive post-transition metal. Its weak, metallic character is illustrated by its amphoteric nature; lead and lead oxides react with acids and bases, and it tends to form covalent bonds. Compounds of lead are usually found in the +2 oxidation state rather than the +4 state common with lighter members of the carbon group. <b>Exceptions</b> <b>are</b> mostly limited to organolead compounds. Like the lighter members of the group, lead tends to bond with itself; it can form chains, rings and polyhedral structures.|$|E
500|$|One {{exception}} {{established at}} the founding is if the witness is [...] "unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination." [...] Another such <b>exception</b> <b>is</b> [...] "forfeiture by wrongdoing," [...] i.e. where the defendant intends to obtain and obtains {{the absence of the}} witness by wrongdoing. Still another <b>exception</b> <b>is</b> [...] "the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing {{the truth of the matter}} asserted." [...] Another possible <b>exception</b> <b>is</b> for dying declarations, i.e. statements made by a speaker on the brink of death while aware that he or she is dying.|$|R
2500|$|If no [...] block {{matches the}} type of the thrown exception, the {{execution}} of the outer block (or method) containing the [...] statement is discontinued, and the <b>exception</b> <b>is</b> passed up and outside the containing block or method.
