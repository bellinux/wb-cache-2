25|$|Peter was a well-connected controversialist and propagandist for Henry II. He {{wrote in}} praise of him to {{continental}} contacts, like Walter of the Mill, now Archbishop of Palermo, defending him against the charge that he had deliberately instigated the murder of Thomas Becket. In introducing the subject of Becket's death, Peter mentioned in passing his own clerical order: in verbo Domini et in ordine diaconi vobis dico – “in the Word of God and the order of deacon <b>I</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> you.” At some stage in his education, he had been ordained a deacon {{and he seems to}} have avoided ordination to the priesthood.|$|E
500|$|Additionally Bob Stokoe {{would later}} claim that while {{managing}} Bury in 1962, Revie had {{offered him a}} bribe of £500 to [...] "go easy" [...] on his Leeds side {{who were at the}} time struggling against relegation to the Third Division and that he had become enraged when Revie responded to his refusal to accept the bribe by asking [...] "in that case, may <b>I</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> your players?". Alan Ball also alleged that Revie made an illegal approach for him, and despite pocketing the £300 bribe he instead signed for Everton instead of Leeds; both men were charged with bringing the game into disrepute. The allegations of corruption earned him the nickname of [...] "Don Readies". Though Mr Justice Cantley lifted the FA's ten-year ban on Revie, during his conclusion of the case the judge said that Revie [...] "lacked candour", was [...] "greedy" [...] and [...] "prickly", focused on [...] "imagined wrongs" [...] and his resignation as England manager showed a [...] "sensational, outrageous example of disloyalty, breach of trust, discourtesy and selfishness".|$|E

500|$|Chelsea manager José Mourinho {{used his}} pre-match {{interview}} {{to state that}} his previous wins in the tournament had changed the way that clubs approach the League Cup: [...] "Lots of teams have followed us since then when we took the League Cup as a real competition, as a real challenge. It is a big competition." [...] He separated the final from the league season, saying, [...] "I don't think if we win the cup final we will win the league, or if we lose it we will lose the league." [...] He refused to discuss the suspension of Matić, dismissing it with [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> you about that, I promise you I will be in big trouble". Despite opining that the two teams and the match officials would act fairly, he criticised players who dive, despite not naming any names. Mourinho also claimed that in after leaving Chelsea {{for the first time}} in September 2007, he was approached to manage Tottenham by chairman Daniel Levy, and again in 2012.|$|E
500|$|In February 2010 when {{accompanying}} the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on a three-day visit to Saudi Arabia, he said [...] "We feel that Saudi Arabia {{has a long}} and close relationship with Pakistan, that makes Saudi Arabia even more a valuable interlocutor for us. When we tell them about our experience, Saudi Arabia listens as somebody who is {{not in any way}} an enemy of Pakistan, but a friend of Pakistan and, therefore, will listen with sympathy and concern to a matter of this nature". He was asked whether India expected Saudi Arabia, given its close ties with Islamabad, to help address the terror threat from Pakistan. The remark about Saudi Arabia being a [...] "valuable interlocutor" [...] raised a strong reaction within the Indian political circle. The Pakistani press even went on to report that he had proposed that Saudi Arabia play a mediator's role in improving India's relationship with Pakistan. In response, Tharoor denied that 'interlocutor' meant 'mediator', and tweeted an explanation, saying, [...] "An [...] is someone you speak to. If <b>I</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> you, you are my interlocutor. I mentioned the Saudis as our interlocutors, i.e. the people we are here to speak to".|$|E

They show me – on my request – {{the place of}} the 2 {{carriers}} (see 2–12–41) West of Honolulu. I ask what the idea is of these carriers on that place. The answer was: 'perhaps in connection with Japanese rapports [...] on eventual American actions'. There is not one of ours who speaks about a possible air attack on Honolulu. I myself did not think of it because I believed everyone on Honolulu to be 100% on the alert, as everyone here on O.N.I. There prevails a tense state of mind at O.N.I."

2500|$|Despite {{appearing}} {{regularly for}} England in FIFA World Cup qualifying matches and friendly matches, Defoe was not {{named in the}} provisional England squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany and named only on a five-man standby list. He joined the squad for training in Germany, but returned to England when Wayne Rooney was cleared to play after having suffered a foot injury in April. He confessed that he was baffled by his omission, saying, [...] "I've been involved in every squad {{for the last two}} years and feel I've played a part in helping us to qualify. I have never felt fitter and sharper than I was in training and believe I could have scored goals in the tournament. It's a strange decision and everybody <b>I</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> thinks so as well." [...] Eriksson explained why Defoe was not selected for the England squad: [...] "Jermain had a very bad season. I don't think he deserved to go to the World Cup." ...|$|E

2500|$|An initial {{proposal}} to find up to £120 billion that Corbyn {{alleged to be}} lost through tax avoidance and evasion, by investing £1 billion in HMRC, was strongly criticised by former Labour Leader Ed Miliband's former adviser, Jolyon Maugham Q.C., {{who claimed to have}} found a £100 billion [...] "black hole" [...] in Corbyn's plans. Richard Murphy clarified that the £120 billion figure reflects what he believes is the overall tax gap (which is substantially bigger than the HMRC figure of £34 billion for the overall tax gap). of which Murphy calculates the collectable portion of is up to £20 billion. Maugham stated that this lower figure would only be available if a range of very unlikely decisions were to be made by Osborne (then Chancellor of the Exchequer), saying that [...] "if this [...] was a brilliant 'slam dunk' thing to do, it would have been done already". In an interview with CNBC, Murphy said that [...] "This issue is bigger than HMRC can deal with at the moment. Spending up to £300 million on staff could raise £8 billion extra, according to people <b>I</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> at HMRC." ...|$|E
