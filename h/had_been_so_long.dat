Those who previously had doubted whether a fission-fusion bomb would be feasible at all were converted into believing {{that it was only}} a matter of time before both the USA and the USSR had developed multi-megaton weapons. Even Oppenheimer, who was originally opposed to the project, called the idea [...] "technically sweet." ...|$|E
500|$|At age 17 in 1902, Roosevelt {{completed}} her formal education {{and returned to}} the United States; she was presented at a debutante ball at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel on December 14. She was later given her own [...] "coming out party". She said of her debut in a public discussion once (as later recounted in her New York Times obituary), [...] "It was simply awful. It was a beautiful party, of course, but I was so unhappy, because a girl who comes out is so utterly miserable if she does not know all the young people. Of course I <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> abroad that I had lost touch with all the girls I used to know in New York. I was miserable through all that." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{number of}} {{commentators}} {{have been critical}} of de Gaulle for his failure to prevent the massacres after Algerian independence while others take the view that the struggle <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> and savage that it was perhaps inevitable. The Australian historian Brian Crozier wrote, [...] "that he was able to part with Algeria without civil war was a great though negative achievement which in all probability would have been beyond the capacity of any other leader France possessed." [...] In April 1961, when four rebel generals seized power in Algeria, he [...] "did not flinch {{in the face of this}} daunting challenge", but appeared on television in his general's uniform to forbid Frenchmen to obey the rebels' orders in an [...] "inflexible display of personal authority".|$|E

2500|$|However, eminent {{historian}} Fernand Braudel (d. 1985), {{a leader}} of [...] the important Annales School [...] wrote: [...] "all historians have opposed this tenuous theory [...] , although they have not managed {{to be rid of}} it once and for all. Yet it is clearly false. The northern countries took over the place that earlier <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> and brilliantly been occupied by the old capitalist centers of the Mediterranean. They invented nothing, either in technology or business management." [...] Social scientist Rodney Stark moreover comments that [...] "during their critical period of economic development, these northern centers of capitalism were Catholic, not Protestant — the Reformation still lay well into the future," [...] while British historian Hugh Trevor-Roper (d. 2003) said, [...] "The idea that large-scale industrial capitalism was ideologically impossible before the Reformation is exploded by the simple fact that it existed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brown did {{not accept}} Freud's theory of an innate {{biological}} dynamic leading from undifferentiated sexuality to adult genitality, and suggested instead that the explanation of how mankind abandoned the [...] "primeval happiness" [...] of polymorphous perversity was to be found through an analysis of social history. Robinson comments that Brown in fact offered no such analysis, and instead produced an [...] "exclusively ontogentic explanation", one he finds inconsistent with [...] "the prophetic intentions" [...] of Brown's larger argument. Brown explained repressive differentiation in terms of Freud's revised theory of anxiety, according to which anxiety produces repression rather than the reverse. Brown, like Róheim, saw the basic form of anxiety as separation anxiety, and also identified separation with death, {{a breakdown of the}} union of mother and child that he saw as [...] "the essence of life." [...] Robinson finds the identification of life with union and death with separation neither easy to understand nor essential to Brown's argument, seeing his crucial point as being that anxiety can be identified with separation, and that separation causes anxiety because the union between mother and child <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> and lovingly indulged.|$|E
