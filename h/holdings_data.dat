50|$|Most {{observers}} credited {{land reform}} measures with liquidating concentration of very large estates and weakening {{political power of}} landowners. Some government data of uncertain coverage and reliability indicated that before land reform {{more than half of}} agricultural holdings consisted of one hundred hectares or more, but after reform such large holdings amounted to less than 1 percent. The same data showed that smallholdings (seven hectares or less) had increased from about one-eighth before land reform to just over one-half of total holdings after reform, and that 42 percent of holdings were between eight and twenty-five hectares. Other government statistics indicated that holdings of twenty five hectares or less, representing 30 percent of all land under cultivation before 1959, represented 93 percent in 1975. A May 1980 Order in Council mandated additional expropriations and further reduced the size of agricultural <b>holdings.</b> <b>Data</b> from the 1970 census revealed that the average farm holding was about ten hectares, and that one-fifth of the rural population remained landless. Despite the Baath Party's commitment to land reform, the private sector controlled 74 percent of Syria's arable land in 1984.|$|E
50|$|Record linkage is an {{important}} tool in creating data required for examining {{the health of the}} public and {{of the health care system}} itself. It can be used to improve data <b>holdings,</b> <b>data</b> collection, quality assessment, and the dissemination of information. Data sources can be examined to eliminate duplicate records, to identify under-reporting and missing cases (e.g., census population counts), to create person-oriented health statistics, and to generate disease registries and health surveillance systems. Some cancer registries link various data sources (e.g., hospital admissions, pathology and clinical reports, and death registrations) to generate their registries. Record linkage is also used to create health indicators. For example, fetal and infant mortality is a general indicator of a country's socioeconomic development, public health, and maternal and child services. If infant death records are matched to birth records, it is possible to use birth variables, such as birth weight and gestational age, along with mortality data, such as cause of death, in analyzing the data. Linkages can help in follow-up studies of cohorts or other groups to determine factors such as vital status, residential status, or health outcomes. Tracing is often needed for follow-up of industrial cohorts, clinical trials, and longitudinal surveys to obtain the cause of death and/or cancer. An example of a successful and long-standing record linkage system allowing for population-based medical research is the Rochester Epidemiology Project based in Rochester, Minnesota.|$|E

We use the new measures to provide fresh insights about performance in a sample of U. S. equity pension fund managers. ...|$|E
40|$|Similar to equity {{mutual funds}} that {{practice}} window dressing by holding winning funds {{at the time of}} disclosure, many industry experts have speculated that bond mutual funds also practice window dressing by holding higher quality bonds during the time of disclosure. Despite such speculation, no direct test of window dressing behavior in bond mutual funds has been conducted. This paper attempts to fill that void. We examine portfolio credit quality holding and daily return patterns in a large sample of bond mutual funds and document evidence of window dressing. Using portfolio credit quality <b>holdings</b> <b>data,</b> we find that bond funds on average hold significantly more government bonds during disclosure than nondisclosure, presumably to present a safer portfolio to shareholders. We also detect a clientele of bond funds that increase positions in speculative-grade corporate bonds at disclosure, most likely in an attempt to advertise higher yields. Multiple index market models estimated with daily returns data corroborate these findings. We detect differences in factor loadings around disclosure periods that indicate systematic tilting of the portfolio toward one sector of the bond market and away from another. Consistent with our findings with portfolio <b>holdings</b> <b>data,</b> the market models indicate one clientele of funds that tilts toward government bonds and another that tilts toward corporate bonds...|$|E
