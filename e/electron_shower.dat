In 1935, Bhabha published a paper in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, Series A, in which he performed the first calculation to determine the cross section of electron-positron scattering. Electron-positron scattering was later named Bhabha scattering, in honor of his contributions in the field.|$|E

Nuclear radiation {{is not easy to}} detect. Radiation detection is always a multistep, highly indirect process. For example, in a scintillation detector, incident radiation excites a fluorescent material that de-excites by emitting photons of light. The light is focused onto the photocathode of a photomultiplier tube that triggers an electron avalanche. The <b>electron</b> <b>shower</b> produces an electrical pulse that activates a meter read by the operator. Not surprisingly, the quantitative relationship between the amount of radiation actually emitted and the reading on the meter is a complex function of many factors. Since those factors may only be controlled well within a laboratory, only in a laboratory setting may true measurements be made." [...] This can be a field laboratory.|$|E

Using refined techniques and new theoretical developments, the analyses utilize data from regions of the detectors previously excluded. The three analyses are described in the following sections. 1. W boson mass measurement We present a new measurement [1] of the W boson mass based on 82 pb− 1 of data collected by the DØ detector during 1994 - 1995. We utilize eν events in which the <b>electron</b> <b>shower</b> {{is close to the}} phi edge of one of the 32 modules in the DØ central calorimeter. The electromagnetic calorimeter response and resolution in this region differs from that {{in the rest of the}} module. For this reason, edge electrons were not utilized in our previous {{measurements of}} the W mass [2]. Using the sample of W → eν events with edge electrons, we repeat the measurement described in our published results [2], and extract the W boson mass by fitting to the transverse mass (Fig. 1) and to the electron (Fig. 2) and neutrino (Fig. 3) transverse momentum distributions. In addition, we use Z → ee events that have one electron in the edge region, to additionally constrain the detector model for the non-edge electrons, and improve our previous measurement of the W boson mass. A summary of the results can be seen in Fig. 4. The updated result for the W boson mass from DØ is MW = 80. 483 ± 0. 084 GeV, which represents an improvement of 7 MeV with respect to our previous result. PrHEP hep 200...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{particle}} physics research {{is dedicated to}} study the fundamental constituents of matter and their interactions. Scientific research findings on both theoretical and experimental sides during the past decades have been condensed in the Standard Model of {{particle physics}}. In this model, the interactions between fundamental particles are described by gauge fields and the exchange of corresponding gauge bosons. The Standard Model contains several such bosons, for example the massive and charged W bosons and a neutral Z boson, that have been observed experimentally. The simplest and most popular implementation of electroweak symmetry breaking to attribute mass to the W and Z bosons is the Higgs mechanism. This mechanism implies the existence of one additional particle, the Higgs boson, {{that is the only}} remaining particle of the Standard Model to be established experimentally. In July 2012, the discovery of a new neutral boson with a measured mass of about 126 GeV was announced by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the particle physics research laboratory CERN near Geneva. This thesis was carried out within the ATLAS collaboration and is dedicated to the search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in the decay channel H→ W^+W^-→ℓ^+νℓ^-ν̅. The analysis is based on datasets collected in proton-proton collisions in 2011 and 2012 by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider LHC at CERN. The studies performed {{in the course of this}} thesis consisted in the multi-stage selection of the H→ W^+W^-→ℓ^+νℓ^-ν̅ final states and the construction of control regions to validate the Monte Carlo simulation of the main background components in general and of the Standard Model WW process, the dominant background, in particular. An independent and complementary study to constrain the diboson background was performed focusing on the selection of a very pure WZ control region. This method allows for a direct comparison of the diboson kinematic distributions between data and Monte Carlo predictions and opens the possibility to further improve the understanding of the WW background. An additional emphasis was placed on a solid understanding of the electron identification capabilities at the ATLAS experiment. A set of <b>electron</b> <b>shower</b> shape distributions was extracted using Z → e^+e^- decays on the dataset taken in 2010 by the ATLAS experiment. This study served as an important basis for the improvement of the calorimeter simulations and contributed significantly to the optimisation of the electron identification...|$|E
