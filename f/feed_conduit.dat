It was one of the first attempts to quantify eruptive activity on the basis of seismic data. The indices permitted him to establish correlations at Mt. Vesuvius between seismic observations and eruptive phenomena. He found significant differences in the character of the recorded seismic signals between pre- and post-eruptive phases of effusive and explosive activity of the March 1944 eruption of Vesuvius.

40|$|International audienceThe late {{stages of}} the Variscan orogeny in western and central Europe are {{characterized}} by the emplacement of numerous Carboniferous granitic intrusions. In {{the southern part of}} the Armorican massif, volcanic and plutonic rocks occur within the Carboniferous series of the Ancenis basin. Chemical analyses indicate that they belong to the same magmatic high-K calc-alkaline association of peraluminous composition, which likely derives from crustal melting of an igneous source. A LA-ICPMS U-Pb/zircon age of 319. 3 ± 3. 1 Ma dates, for the first time, this magmatic event and, by there, constrains the maximum age of both the end of the sedimentation and the northward tilting of the sediments in the Ancenis basin. This magmatic event is coeval with the sedimentation of the coal-bearing Namurian basins located along the Nort-sur-Erdre fault.

This has raised different problems such as: mixing active sources (explosive, vibroseis) with different signal properties; inverting traveltime residuals {{of the order of}} 10 ms which requires the corresponding accuracy on the Digital Elevation Model (DEM), source and sensor locations (300 sites) and traveltime computations. The results of the traveltime tomography reveal three main bodies of high velocity embedded within scoria layers.

40|$|A {{multidisciplinary}} approach based on image analysis of seismic signals, thermodynamics and mass balance {{has been here}} adopted to find quantitative relations between magma degassing at depth and the transition from Strombolian activity to lava fountaining {{for a set of}} paroxysmal eruptions occurred at Mt. Etna volcano in March-April 2013. The image processing of the seismogram allows handling of a huge quantity of data, providing a tool for the simple extraction of numerical values. We propose a model based on the consideration that gas outbursts are a vehicle of the transfer of energy tracked by seismic signals during the uprising of magma. Thus, the simple assumption of a relation of proportionality between the energy of the seismic signal and the mass of exsolved gas allows us to interpret transitions of the eruptive style as due to the amount of undegassed magma recharging the feeding system. Changes of this recharge rate in the range of 1 : 20 control the evolution of the eruptive process, and are evidence for the limited area section of the <b>feeding</b> <b>conduit.</b> Being this transition process observed in volcanic regions worldwide, the model can be successfully applied to other basaltic volcanoes. Furthermore, the image analysis technique may be applied to other contexts in which the interpretation of seismograms is necessary...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn the {{southern}} part of the Armorican Massif, a Carboniferous continental sedimentation is preserved in two basins located along a dextral fault (the Nort-sur-Erdre Fault). The first one called the Ancenis Basin is Early Carboniferous in age. The second, Namurian in age (i. e. Early to Late Carboniferous), consists of coal-bearing basins (Basse-Loire Unit) and is supposed to be synchronous with the dextral displacement along the North-sur-Erdre Fault. The Carboniferous series of the Ancenis Basin presents intrusive rocks (granite, microgranites) and volcanic rocks (rhyolites). Chemical analyses indicate that they all belong to the same magmatic high-K calc-alkaline association of peraluminous composition. For the first time, this magmatic event has been dated using the LA-ICPMS U-Pb method on zircons. The obtained age is of 319. 3 3. 1 Ma and constrains both the maximum age of end of the sedimentation and the northward tilting of the sediments in the Ancenis Basin.

These intrusions are interpreted as the <b>feeding</b> <b>conduits</b> of the volcano-sedimentary layers encountered in these basins.

40|$|Abstract: Gas {{assisted}} atomization {{is becoming}} increasingly important in many industrial applications such as physical, chemical and petroleum processes. In order to achieve proper atomization {{it is crucial to}} have proper mixing of gas (air) and liquid (water) in the <b>feeding</b> <b>conduit</b> before it enters into the nozzle. The flow regime, as well as the flow pattern and structure of the flow, are some of the important parameters that describe two-phase gas/liquid flows, and identify two-phase gas/liquid flow regimes. It is also desirable to know under what conditions there is a transition among the different flow regimes (dispersed, stratified, annular, annular-dispersed, slug, wavy-slug, mist-annular). Due to the existence of relative movement in the interfaces and variable interactions between two phases, two-phase gas/liquid flow is a complex transport phenomenon compared to single-phase flow. Still, there is no effective technique to identify the two-phase gas/liquid flow regimes and it is even difficult to capture the accurate flow structures in smaller conduits in turbulent flow cases. Lack of solid and comprehensive theories for predicting and calculating the pressure and void fraction variations in two-phase air/water flow situations has left engineers without essential information for proper design of two-phase flow systems. This review is an effort to explore the state of the present advanced measurement techniques in this field of research. Subsequently, some of the advanced void fraction, photonics and pressure measurement techniques and correlations for identification of two-phase gas/liquid flow regimes and bubble sizes are investigated...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyzed}} crater SO 2 fluxes from Mt Etna, {{together with}} soil CO 2 effluxes from the volcano's flanks, {{in the period}} from 2001 to 2005. Between the 2001 and 2002 – 2003 eruptions, persistently low values of both parameters suggest that no new gas-rich magma was accumulating at shallow depth (b 5 km) within Etna's central conduit, whereas very high SO 2 sin-eruptive fluxes during the two eruptions indicated sudden decompression of an un-degassed magma rising along newly-formed eccentric conduits. In November 2003, soil CO 2 data indicate migration of gas-rich magma from deep (> 10 km) to shallow (b 5 km) portions of the <b>feeding</b> <b>conduits,</b> preceded {{by an increase in}} crater SO 2 fluxes. A similar behavior was observed also during and after the following 2004 – 2005 eruption. This degassing style matches a period of increased structural instability of the volcanic edifice caused by acceleration of spreading that affected both its eastern and southern flanks. Spreading could have triggered progressively deeper depressurization in the central conduit, inducing release of the more soluble gas (SO 2) first, and then of CO 2, contrary to what was observed before the 2001 eruption. This suggests that the edifice has depressurized, promoting ascent of fresh-magma and increasing permeability favouring release of CO 2 flux. By integrating geochemical and structural data, previous degassing models developed at Mt. Etna have been updated to advance the understanding of eruptive events that occurred in recent years...|$|R
40|$|Systematic {{investigation}} of discrete gravity measurements has continued at Mount Etna since 1986. The network now covers {{an area of}} 400 km 2 with about 70 stations 0. 5 – 3 km apart. Mass redistributions occurring at depths ranging between about 8 km below sea level and a few hundred metres below the surface (magma level changes within the shallower parts of the <b>feeding</b> <b>conduits)</b> have been identified from these data. Conventional (discrete) microgravity monitoring on a network of stations furnishes only instantaneous states of the mass distribution at continuously active systems. In order to obtain information on {{the rate at which}} the volcanic processes (and thus mass transfers) occur, three stations for continuously recording gravity where installed on Mount Etna in 1998. A 16 -month long sequence from one of the continuously running stations (PDN, located 2 km from the active northeast crater at the summit of Etna volcano) is presented. After removing the effects of Earth Tide and tilt, the correlation of the residual gravity sequence with simultaneous recordings of meteorological parameters acquired at the same station was analysed. Once the meteorological effects have also been removed, continuous gravity changes are within 10 μGal of gravity changes measured using conventional microgravity observations at sites very close to the continuous station. This example shows how discrete and continuous gravity observations can be used together at active volcanoes to get a fuller and more accurate picture of the spatial and temporal characteristics of volcanic processes...|$|R
40|$|The oil {{feeding of}} a {{squeeze film damper}} through holes can be an {{interesting}} solution to improve the damper's energy dissipation capability since it increases the journal's effective squeezing surface. While groove feeding has been extensively studied, only a few works have addressed the problem of hole fed dampers. The squeeze film damper model {{may be able to}} estimate the pressure at the feed holes as well as the flow into the film. A fundamental issue in the modeling of the hole feed system is the choice of the adequate boundary conditions. Existing published models consider the supply pressure to be constant at a specific section of the hydraulic system. The pressures at the oil injection holes are then obtained via local flow balances taking into account a linear flow resistance across the <b>feed</b> <b>conduits.</b> The model developed in the present work is based on the application of the simplified form of the energy equation commonly used in hydraulics, with approximate pressure drop coefficients. As a boundary condition we impose the power supplied to the pump. The nonlinear hydraulics problem is coupled with the squeeze flow and the Newton–Raphson method is employed to solve the set of nonlinear equations. The influence of the hole feed system on the unbalance response and stability of a Jeffcott rotor is analyzed in regards to the number of feed holes and the power supplied to the pump. The feed system behavior is also studied...|$|R
40|$|Investigating Etna’s {{long-term}} SO 2 ﬂux behaviour has led {{to important}} conclusions {{on the structure of}} the volcano’s magma feeding system, magma production (and degassing) rates, and causes for the excess degassing behaviour. Nonetheless, our knowledge of the short-term (timescales of seconds to a few hours) behaviour of magmatic volatiles (e. g., bubble coalescence, separate ascent and surface bursting of gas-rich bubbles) in the volcano’s upper <b>feeding</b> <b>conduit</b> system is still fragmentary, and based on indirect evidences (petrologic-textural data, observation of geophysical signals, physical modelling and laboratory experiments). In the past, direct gas ﬂux measurements at Etna have been taken with insufﬁcient temporal resolution for fast conduit processes to be investigated. UV cameras now allow imaging of gas ﬂux emissions, and exploration of underlying volcanic degassing processes, with an improved temporal resolution. In this work we show that UV cameras can valuably assist in capturing the rapid (timescale of seconds) SO 2 ﬂux variations occurring during the quiescent activity of a basaltic volcano. We have, in particular, investigated the non-stationary nature of degassing activity at Etna’s North-east crater, which is shown here to exhibit a somewhat periodic degassing behaviour (characteristic periods ranging 40 - 250 s). A similar degassing behaviour has recently been observed at other volcanoes (Stromboli, Erebus, San Cristobal, Gorely), and probably represents a common feature of all basaltic volcanoes. We ﬁnally present a preliminary model, which results suggest that the periodic degassing pattern may reﬂect inhomogeneous distribution of gas bubbles in a magmatic conduit, and their clustering to form trains of variably spaced gas bubble layers...|$|R
40|$|The joint {{application}} of different seismological techniques for seismic noise analysis, {{and the results}} of a volcanological and morphostructural survey, have allowed us to obtain a detailed and well constrained image of the shallow crustal structure of the Solfatara volcano (Campi Flegrei caldera, Italy). Horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratios, inversion of surface wave dispersion curves and polarization analysis provided resonance frequencies and peak amplitudes, shear wave velocity profiles and polarization pattern of coherent ambient noise. These results, combined in a unique framework, indicate that the volcanic edifice is characterized by lateral and vertical discontinuities and heterogeneities in terms of shear wave velocity, lithological contrasts and structural setting. The interpretation of the seismological results, with the volcanological and morphostructural constraints, supports the hypothesis that the volcano has been characterized by a complex and intense activity, with the alternation of constructive and destructive phases, during which magmatic and phreatomagmatic explosions built a complex tuff-cone, later reworked by atmospheric agents and altered by hydrothermal activity. The differences in the velocity structure between the central and eastern parts of the crater have been interpreted as resulting from a possible eastward migration of the eruptive vent along the deformational features affecting the area, and to the presence of viscous lava and lithified tuff bodies within the <b>feeding</b> <b>conduits,</b> which are buried under a covering of reworked materials of variable thickness. The observed fault and fracture systems, partially inherited from regional structural setting and exhumed during volcanism and ground deformation episodes also seems to strongly control wave propagation, affecting the noise polarization properties...|$|R

Contemporaneously we measured the SO 2 flux of the total gas emission released by the combined summit craters 14 km downwind and the SO 2 flux emitted by the NEC measured at the summit. Combining these data we determined the flux of the major volcanic components H 2 O, CO 2, SO 2, HCl and HF emitted individually from CC and NEC craters. The results reveal similar SO 2 /HCl ratios but distinct CO 2 /SO 2 ratios (1. 3 and 10. 9 for NEC and CC, respectively) and {{an order of magnitude}} greater CO 2 flux from the CC compared with the NEC. A simple model in which the NEC branches from a central <b>feeding</b> <b>conduit</b> at a depth of ~ 2 km can reproduce these observations. We highlight that in such a system short-term variations in CO 2 /SO 2 ratios at each crater can occur due to minor variations in the magma/gas flux entering each conduit at the branch, without an overall change in magma supply. CO 2 / SO 2 variations measured at individual craters may therefore be unrepresentative of the volcanic system and require cautious interpretation. Monitoring of the total CO 2 and SO 2 fluxes emitted from each crater is, on the contrary, an optimal monitoring strategy and can be achieved using a combination of CO 2 /SO 2 instruments and SO 2 imaging camera...|$|R
40|$|Fissure ridge travertines {{grown from}} {{geothermal}} springs of Denizli basin, southwestern Turkey, are investigated through stratigraphic, structural, geochemical, and geochronological methods, {{with the aim}} of understanding the growth of these elongate mound-shaped structures. Two main types of travertine deposits are recognized: (1) bedded travertines, which grew as flowstone on sloping surfaces and form the bulk of fissure ridges, and (2) banded travertines, which grew as veins within the bedded travertine chiefly along its central <b>feeding</b> <b>conduit.</b> Stratigraphic and structural observations shed light on the bedded-banded travertine relationships, where the banded features grew through successive accretion phases, cross-cutting the bedded travertine or forming sill-like structures. The bedded and banded travertines alternated their growth as demonstrated by complicated cross-cutting relationships and by the upward suture, in places, of banded travertine by bedded travertine that was, in turn, cross-cut by younger banded travertine. The bedded travertine is often tilted away from the central axis of the fissure ridge, thus leaving more room for the central banded travertine to form. U-series ages confirm the bedded-banded travertine temporal relationships and show that the growth of the studied fissure ridges lasted up to several tens of ka during Quaternary time. The banded travertine deposited mainly during cold-dry events possibly in coincidence with seismic events that might have triggered the outflow of deep geothermal fluids. C and O stable isotope and REE data indicate a shallow feeding circuit for the studied structures with a fluid component deriving from a deeper geothermal circuit. A crack-and-seal mechanism of fissure ridge growth is proposed, modulated by the interplay of local and regional influencing factors and mechanisms such as geothermal fluid discharge, paleoclimate, tectonics, and the progressive tilting of bedded travertine limbs over a soft substratum creating the necessary space for the central veins to grow.

40|$|The {{research}} {{began with}} a geological and structural survey of the Triassic subvolcanic bodies cropping out {{in the area of}} Montecampione (Val Camonica-BS, Italy). This study allowed the determination of the main phases of intrusion of these bodies, and new and significant sampling of the magmatic rocks in order to reconstruct the geodynamic framework based on high quality geochemical analyses. These intrusive bodies, belonging to the «Montecampione group», show a minimum volume of about 1 km 3 and could represent a shallow (about 1000 m) magmatic reservoir producing a volcanic area, since we recognised some structures related to probable <b>feeding</b> <b>conduits,</b> and the presence of volcanic sandstones coeval with or little younger than the radiometric age of these intrusions (231 ± 5 Ma). The subvolcanic bodies can be classified following the terminology of volcanic rocks {{because of the presence of}} abundant devitrified groundmass and a vacuolar texture. On the basis of the chemical composition, these subvolcanic rocks can be classified in the alkaline series as trachyandesites to trachytes, although it is not possible to determine the sodic or potassic affinity because of the high fluid circulation. The study of trace elements, and particularly the pronounced enrichment in LREEs and LILEs, allows us to relate the genesis of these magmas to a back-arc setting associated with the great depths achieved by a subducting slab. Based on the radiometric dating and on the paleogeographical reconstructions available, this geodynamic framework could be related to the subduction of Palaeotethyan oceanic crust during the early phases of the Cimmerian orogeny. The formation of the magmatic bodies constituting the «Montecampione group» emplaced at shallow level can thus be related to magmatic upwelling in the framework of a back-arc with limited extension...|$|R
40|$|Southern Tuscany (Italy) hosts {{geothermal}} anomalies with associated widespread CO gas-rich manifestations {{and active}} travertine-deposing thermal springs. Geothermal anomalies {{have been active}} since the Late Miocene and {{have led to the}} formation of widespread Late Miocene–Pleistocene travertine deposits and meso- and epithermal mineralizations. This study investigates the travertine deposit exposed in the Castelnuovo dell’Abate area of southern Tuscany. Here, a fissure-ridge type travertine deposit and its <b>feeding</b> <b>conduits,</b> currently filled with banded calcite veins (i. e. banded travertine), represent a spectacular example of fossil hydrothermal circulation in the peripheral area of the exploited Monte Amiata geothermal field. The Castelnuovo dell’Abate travertine deposit and associated calcite veins were analysed to establish the characteristics of the parent hydrothermal fluids, and the age of this circulation. The focus of the study was on fluid inclusions, rarely considered in travertine studies, but able to provide direct information on the physico-chemical characteristics of the original fluid. Uranium–thorium geochronological data provided further constraints on the: (1) age of tectonic activity; (2) age of the hydrothermal circulation; and (3) evolution of the Monte Amiata geothermal anomaly. Results indicate that brittle deformation (NW- and SE-trending normal to oblique-slip faults) was active during at least the Middle Pleistocene and controlled a hydrothermal circulation mainly characterized by fluids of meteoric origin, and as old as 300 – 350  ka. This is the oldest circulation documented to date in the Monte Amiata area. The fluid chemical composition is comparable to that of fluids currently exploited in the shallow reservoir of the Monte Amiata geothermal field, therefore suggesting that fluid composition has not changed substantially over time.

40|$|Volatiles carry crucial {{information}} on pre- to sin-eruptive processes at active volcanoes. Measurements of gas emission rates (crater plumes, fumaroles, diffuse soil degassing) therefore improve {{our understanding of}} degassing processes and subsurface magmatic and hydrothermal conditions, and contribute to eruption forecasting. Recent technological developments in spectroscopy have allowed, over the last 30 years, the remote sensing of magmatic volatile emissions from quiescent and erupting degassing volcanoes. These data-sets have contributed to discovering cyclic gas flux components due to periodic magma supply and replenishment in magma storage zones, and/or timescales of magma migration (and degassing) within the <b>feeding</b> <b>conduit</b> systems of volcanoes (chapter 2). In spite of these relevant achievements, a number of magmatic degassing processes have remained elusive to measure, as they occur {{at a faster rate}} than the time resolution of most available spectroscopic techniques. In this study, I take advantage of a novel technique - the UV camera (chapter 3) - to image SO 2 emissions from the Italian volcanoes with improved high temporal resolution. The UV camera heralds the much awaited prospect of capturing transient (≤ tens of seconds) volcanic gas-driven phenomena, such as Strombolian explosions and puffing. Here, this technique has been updated to a new configuration (dual-camera system), which combines higher temporal resolution (0. 5 - 1. 2 Hz) and improved accuracy relative to the single-camera setup. During the first year of this PhD, the methodology has been extensively tested and improved, whilst developing a user-friendly control software (Vulcamera) and a calibration technique (in tandem DOAS-SO 2 quartz cells calibration), which simplify instrument deployment, acquisition and data analysis (chapter 4). The results of the volcano applications of the UV camera are described in chapter 5. A first application (chapter 5. 2) was focused on SO 2 gas flux measurements at individual fumaroles from the La Fossa crater (Vulcano island, Italy) fumarolic field. There, the dual- UV camera technique allowed the simultaneous imaging of multiple-source emissions, discriminating between SO 2 contributions from the four main fumarolic areas. The UV camera-derived individual fumarole SO 2 fluxes have been used in tandem with MultiGASderived gas/SO 2 molar ratios to accurately assess CO 2, H 2 O, and H 2 S fluxes. Results highlight a factor 2 increase in CO 2 and H 2 O degassing during the La Fossa crater degassing/heating unrest event of November-December 2009. Bubbles nucleation (birth), coalescence (growth), outgassing and fragmentation (death), are stages of volatile's life within the magma. Our understanding of these processes mainly comes from modelling and textural studies. In this work, I have attempted to retrace part of the gas bubbles' life by measuring - at high rate - SO 2 outgassing rates from two openvent volcanoes: Stromboli and Etna. On Stromboli (Chapter 5. 3), the UV camera-derived data allowed the first simultaneous estimate of the SO 2 flux contribution from the three main forms of degassing at Stromboli (passive degassing, 84 - 92...|$|R

We find that SO 2 emission rates, measured by COSPEC, correlate with the amplitude of these tilt cycles, and that higher rates of SO 2 emission were associated with stronger ground deformation and enhanced hybrid seismicity. Within tilt cycles, degassing peaks coincide with maximum deformation gradients. Increases {{in the amount of}} gas in the magma <b>conduit</b> <b>feeding</b> the dome, probably due to increases in volatile content of ascending magma volume can account for the observed increases in tilt amplitude, hybrid seismicity and SO 2 emission rate.

40|$|Several {{factors may}} control the {{development}} of a silicic caldera during an eruption: here we match previous studies of caldera forming eruptions with analogue experiments to consider the role of the aspect ratio (thickness/width) of the magma chamber roof. These data suggest that large silicic caldera formation is controlled by: (1) the availability of magma; (2) initial explosive eruption through a conduit connecting the reservoir and the surface; (3) fast depressurization of the reservoir; and (4) chamber roof collapse, with newly-formed fractures connecting the reservoir with the surface and creation of a continuous ring <b>conduit</b> <b>feeding</b> annular vents, capable of sustaining the eruption. The occurrence of the latter condition may depend upon the aspect ratio of the chamber roof: lower ratios (1. 6) form incoherent collapse, which may hinder the continuation of the eruption after an initial partial emptying of the chamber.

Isotopic (δ 18 O and δD), discharge and water head measurements were conducted at the resurgences of a karst system with a strong allogenic recharge component (Val d’Orléans, France), to estimate the amounts of water exchanged and the mixings between a saturated karstic conduit {{and the surrounding}} aquifer. The spatio-temporal variability of the observed exchanges was explored using a 2 D coupled continuum-conduit flow model under saturated conditions (Feflow®). The inputs from the water heads and stable water isotopes in the groundwater flow model suggest that the amounts of water flowing from the aquifer are significant if the conduit flow discharges are less than the conduit flow capacity. This condition creates a spatial distribution of exchanges from upstream where the aquifer <b>feeds</b> the <b>conduit</b> (recharge area) to downstream where the conduit reaches its maximum discharge capacity and can feed the aquifer (discharge area). In the intermediate transport zone no exchange between the two domains takes place that brings a new criterion to delineate the vulnerable zones to surface water. On average, 4 % of the water comes from the local recharge, 80 % is recent river water and 16 % is old river water. During the November 2008 flood, both isotopic signatures and model suggest that exchanges fluctuate around this steady state, limited when the river water level increases and intensified when the river water level decreases. The existence of old water from the river suggests a transient storage at the aquifer/conduit interface that can be considered as an underground hyporheic zone...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{describes}} three mid-Tertiary intrusions {{from the}} Henry Mountains (Utah, USA) that were assembled from amalgamation of multiple horizontal sheet-like magma pulses {{in the absence}} of regional deformation. The three-dimensional intrusion geometries are exceptionally well preserved and include: (1) a highly lobate sill; (2) a laccolith; and (3) a bysmalith (a cylindrical, fault-bounded, piston-like laccolith). Individual intrusive sheets are recognised on the margins of the bodies by stacked lobate contacts, and within the intrusions by both intercalated sedimentary wallrock and formation of solid-state fabrics. Finally, <b>conduits</b> <b>feeding</b> these intrusions were mostly sub-horizontal and pipe-like, as determined by both direct observation and modelling of geophysical data. The intrusion geometries, in aggregate, are interpreted to reflect the time evolution of an idealised upper crustal pluton. These intrusions initiate as sills, evolve into laccoliths, and eventually become piston-like bysmaliths. The emplacement of multiple magma sheets was rapid and pulsed; the largest intrusion was assembled in less than 100 years. The magmatic fabrics are interpreted as recording the internal flow of the sheets preserved by fast cooling rates in the upper crust. Because there are multiple magma sheets, fabrics may vary vertically as different sheets are traversed. These bodie...|$|R
40|$|Laboratory flows, self-capped by high-viscosity fluid, exhibit {{vertical}} pressure gradients {{similar to those}} postulated within <b>conduits</b> <b>feeding</b> dome-building eruptions. Overpressure and pressure cycles exhibited at laboratory scale {{provide insight into the}} mechanism of tilt cycles at volcanic scale. Experimental pressure cycles correlated with the rate of gas escape, with pressure rise being controlled by diffusion of volatile into bubbles during times when gas escape from the flow was negligible. The increase in pressure continued until margin decrepitation created preferential pathways for rapid gas escape from permeable foam, thereby reducing pressure within the flow. As pressure reduced, the gas escape pathways sealed and diffusion repressurized the system. This implies that tilt cycles, such as those exhibited by the Soufrie`re Hills Volcano, Montserrat, result from a diffusively pumped process that oscillates around the viscous-elastic transition within the outer regions of the flow. Phases of open- and closedsystem degassing result, with gas escaping through fractures created and maintained by the flow process itself. Fluid-dynamically, this mechanism generates an oscillation between Poiseuille flow and plug flow, with a 1 -D model of plug motion giving a reasonable representation of observation in both experimental and volcanic cases...|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} goal of volcano seismology is {{to understand}} the dynamics of active magmatic systems {{in order to assess}} eruptive behavior and the associated hazard. Imaging of magma conduits, quantification of magma transport and investigation of long-period seismic sources, together with their temporal variations, are crucial for the comprehension of eruption-triggering mechanisms. At Mt. Etna volcano, several intense episodes of tremor activity were recorded during 2007, in association with strombolian activity and/or intense fire fountaining episodes occurring from the South East Crater (SEC). The locations of the tremor sources and of the long-period seismic events are used here to constrain both the area and the depth range of magma degassing, highlighting the geometry of the shallow <b>conduits</b> <b>feeding</b> SEC. The imaged conduits consist of two connected resonating dike-like bodies, NNW-SSE and NW-SE oriented, extending from sea level to the surface. In addition, we show how tremor, long-period (LP) and very-long-period (VLP) event locations and signatures reflect pressure fluctuations in the plumbing system associated with the ascent/discharge of gas-rich magma linked to the lava fountains. The evidence here reported, also corroborated by ground deformation variations, can help develop a better prediction and early-warning system for those eruptions (effusive or explosive) that apparently manifest no clear precursors...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{combines}} some of {{the results}} and interpretations of geological mapping, seismic refraction, marine seismic, and gravity surveys to show that large tracts of New Britain could be favorable targets for geothermal power development. It is shown that the fractured and faulted lithosphere is associated with grabens and rifts in which mantle material has risen to within 10 to 15 km from the surface. The grabens and rifts are marked by volcanism in which the dominant volcanic rocks are olivine [...] and tholeiitic [...] basalts, with a sprinkling of more acid volcanics ranging from dacite to andesite. Following A. Rittman the basalts {{are believed to have}} originated in the asthenosphere when the lithosphere was broken up under a tensional stress regime; the acid volcanics were formed by magmatic differentiation within the crust. it was argued that ideal geothermal reservoirs are capped with altered ash deposits or other nonpermeable volcanics. To <b>feed</b> such reservoirs <b>conduits</b> are required which are naturally located on fault or shear zones. The two areas selected as favorable for future geothermal power development are located between Talasea and Lolobau Is., say around Hoskins; and near Rabaul, between Matupi Harbor and Matupi. As a type area, the rift between the Gazelle Peninsula and New Ireland resembles the Afar triangle, at the northern end of the Great Valley Rift system of Africa...|$|R
40|$|Open-conduit {{volcanic}} {{systems are}} typically characterized by unsealed volcanic <b>conduits</b> <b>feeding</b> permanent or quasi-permanent volcanic activity. This persistent activity limits {{our ability to}} read changes in the monitored parameters, making the assessment of possible eruptive crises more difficult. We show how an integrated approach to monitoring can solve this problem, opening {{a new way to}} data interpretation. The increasing rate of explosive transients, tremor amplitude, thermal emissions of ejected tephra, and rise of the very-long- period (VLP) seismic source towards the surface are interpreted as indicating an upward migration of the magma column in response to an increased magma input rate. During the 2014 flank eruption of Stromboli, this magma input pre- ceded the effusive eruption by several months. When the new lateral effusive vent opened on the Sciara del Fuoco slope, the effusion was accompanied by a large ground deflation, a deepening of the VLP seismic source, and the cessation of summit explosive activity. Such observations suggest the drainage of a superficial magma reservoir confined between the crater terrace and the effusive vent. We show how this model successfully reproduces the measured rate of effusion, the observed rate of ground deflation, and the deepening of the VLP seismic source. This study also demonstrates the ability of the geophysical network to detect superficial magma recharge within an open-conduit system and to track magma drainage during the effusive crisis, with a great impact on hazard assessment...|$|R
40|$|Magma is transported through Earth 2 ̆ 7 s solid crust by two {{different}} processes, diking and diapirism, although other mechanisms, such as porous and channeled flow, can transport melt through partially molten crustal areas. Dikes are ubiquitous {{indicators of the}} transport of magma in the shallow crust by brittle fracture, and there is ample geological and geophysical evidence supporting diking as a magma-ascent mechanism through the crust. On the other hand, igneous diapirism, involving magma ascent by gravitational instability and requiring viscous or plastic flow of country rock (“hot Stokes” diapirs), is often invoked as a magma-transport mechanism restricted to the ductile upper mantle or lower crust. However, unequivocal geological field evidence for igneous diapirism has proven elusive {{and has been a}} matter of considerable debate. We report geological and geophysical evidence showing that Pliocene sills emplaced in the upper levels of brittle continental crust of the Colorado Plateau in the San Rafael subvolcanic field (Utah) became gravitationally unstable by mechanically altering the overlying sedimentary rocks. These sills grew into structures that we recognize as domes and plugs at the current level of exposure. Some of these plugs continued to transport magma to shallower levels of the continental crust and eventually acted as <b>conduits</b> <b>feeding</b> volcanic eruptions. Our geological and geophysical findings indicate that gravitational instability is a viable mechanism for the initiation of magma ascent in the upper continental crust for small volumes of basaltic magma under specific conditions...|$|R
40|$|Calderas {{are among}} the most active and {{dangerous}} volcanoes. Caldera unrest is defined by enhanced seismicity, gravity changes, surface deformation and degassing. Although much caldera unrest does not lead to an eruption, every eruption is preceded by an unrest episode. Therefore, the proper description of unrest and the forecast of its possible outcome is a timely and challenging task. Here we review the best known unrest at calderas from 1988 to 2014, building on previous work and propose an updated database. Where established, the root cause for unrest is always magmatic; none was purely hydrothermal or tectonic. An interpretive classification of unrest invokes two spectra – compositional (mafic to felsic) and the state of magma <b>conduits</b> <b>feeding</b> from the magma reservoir(s) to the surface (from fully plugged, through semi-plugged, to open). Magma and gas in open conduits can rise and erupt freely; magma in semi-plugged conduits erupts less frequently, yet still allows some gas to escape; plugged conduits allow neither magma nor gas to escape. Unrest in mafic calderas is subtler, less pronounced and repeated, especially with open systems, ensuring the continuous, aseismic and moderate release of magma. Plugged felsic calderas erupt infrequently, anticipated by isolated, short and seismically active unrest. Semi-plugged felsic calderas also erupt infrequently and are restless over decades or centuries, with uplift, seismicity and degassing and, on the longer-term, resurgence, suggesting repeated stalled intrusions. Finally, the expected advances in better understanding caldera unrest are discussed...|$|R
