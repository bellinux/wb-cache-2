Captain Clavering is desirous of consulting Madam Gordeloup on an affair of much importance." [...] "Consult me!" [...] said Sophie to herself, when she got the letter. [...] "For what should he consult me? It is that stupid man I saw with Julie. Ah, well; never mind. The stupid man shall come." [...] The commissioner, therefore, who had taken the letter to Mount Street, returned to the club with a note in which Madam Gordeloup expressed her willingness to undergo the proposed interview.

60|$|The {{death of}} Louis XV., in 1774, brought {{the folly of}} the secret policy to an end, {{but in the same}} year rumours about d'Éon's dubious sex {{appeared}} in the English newspapers on the occasion of his book, Les Loisirs du Chevalier d'Éon, published at Amsterdam. Bets on his sex were made, and d'Éon beat some bookmakers with his stick. But he persuaded Drouet, an envoy from France, that the current stories were true, and this can only be explained, if explained at all, by his perception of the fact that, his secret employment being gone, he felt the need of an advertisement. Overtures for the return of the secret papers were again made to d'Éon, but he insisted on the restoration of his <b>diplomatic</b> <b>rank,</b> and on receiving 14,000l. on account of expenses. He had aimed too high, however, and was glad to come to a compromise with the famous Beaumarchais. The extraordinary bargain was struck that d'Éon, for a consideration, should yield the secret papers, and, to avoid a duel with the son of de Guerchy, and the consequent scandal, should pretend to be a woman, and wear the dress of that sex. In his new capacity he might return to France and wear the cross of the Order of St. Louis.|$|E
