25|$|Denitrification is the {{reduction}} of nitrates back into nitrogen gas (N2), completing the nitrogen cycle. This process is performed by bacterial species such as Pseudomonas and Clostridium in anaerobic conditions. They use the nitrate as an electron acceptor {{in the place of}} oxygen during respiration. These facultatively anaerobic bacteria can also live in aerobic conditions. Denitrification happens in anaerobic conditions e.g. waterlogged soils. The <b>denitrifying</b> <b>bacteria</b> use nitrates in the soil to carry out respiration and consequently produce nitrogen gas, which is inert and unavailable to plants.|$|E
25|$|The mustard Arabidopsis thaliana, {{one of the}} best-studied {{plants in}} the world, {{normally}} turns red under harsh conditions. But {{using a combination of}} natural mutations and genetic manipulation, scientists from Danish biotechnology company Aresa Biodetection, created a strain that only changes color in response to the nitrous oxide that leaks from landmines and other explosives. Because nitrous oxide can also be formed by <b>denitrifying</b> <b>bacteria,</b> there is some risk of false positives using this technique, and researchers are attempting to make the plant less sensitive. The plants would aid demining by indicating the presence of mines through color change, and could either be sown from aircraft or by people walking through demined corridors in minefields. As of February 2005, no studies have been conducted with actual landmines, though successful studies have been done in greenhouses. In order {{to prevent the spread of}} this genetically modified organism into the wild, the plants have been further modified so that they will only sprout when provided with an external growth factor.|$|E

25|$|The salt marshes of Cape Cod, Massachusetts (U.S.A), are {{experiencing}} creek bank die-offs of Spartina spp. (cordgrass) {{that has been}} attributed to herbivory by the crab Sesarma reticulatum. At 12 surveyed Cape Cod salt marsh sites, 10% - 90% of creek banks experienced die-off of cordgrass in association with a highly denuded substrate and high density of crab burrows. Populations of Sesarma reticulatum are increasing, possibly {{as a result of the}} degradation of the coastal food web in the region. The bare areas left by the intense grazing of cordgrass by Sesarma reticulatum at Cape Cod are suitable for occupation by another burrowing crab, Uca pugnax, which are not known to consume live macrophytes. The intense bioturbation of salt marsh sediments from this crab's burrowing activity has been shown to dramatically reduce the success of Spartina alterniflora and Suaeda maritima seed germination and established seedling survival, either by burial or exposure of seeds, or uprooting or burial of established seedlings. However, bioturbation by crabs may also have a positive effect. In New Zealand, the tunnelling mud crab Helice crassa has been given the stately name of an 'ecosystem engineer' for its ability to construct new habitats and alter the access of nutrients to other species. Their burrows provide an avenue for the transport of dissolved oxygen in the burrow water through the oxic sediment of the burrow walls and into the surrounding anoxic sediment, which creates the perfect habitat for special nitrogen cycling bacteria. These nitrate reducing (<b>denitrifying)</b> <b>bacteria</b> quickly consume the dissolved oxygen entering into the burrow walls to create the oxic mud layer that is thinner than that at the mud surface. This allows a more direct diffusion path for the export of nitrogen (in the form of gaseous nitrogen (N2)) into the flushing tidal water.|$|E
2500|$|Denitrification is the {{utilization}} of nitrate (...) as a terminal electron acceptor. [...] It is a widespread process {{that is used by}} many members of the Proteobacteria. [...] Many facultative anaerobes use denitrification because nitrate, like oxygen, has a high reduction potential. [...] Many <b>denitrifying</b> <b>bacteria</b> can also use ferric iron (...) and some organic electron acceptors. [...] Denitrification involves the stepwise reduction of nitrate to nitrite (...) , nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (...) , and dinitrogen (...) by the enzymes nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase, nitric oxide reductase, and nitrous oxide reductase, respectively. [...] Protons are transported across the membrane by the initial NADH reductase, quinones, and nitrous oxide reductase to produce the electrochemical gradient critical for respiration. [...] Some organisms (e.g. E. coli) only produce nitrate reductase and therefore can accomplish only the first reduction leading to the accumulation of nitrite. [...] Others (e.g. Paracoccus denitrificans or Pseudomonas stutzeri) reduce nitrate completely. [...] Complete denitrification is an environmentally significant process because some intermediates of denitrification (nitric oxide and nitrous oxide) are important greenhouse gases that react with sunlight and ozone to produce nitric acid, a component of acid rain. [...] Denitrification is also important in biological wastewater treatment where it is used {{to reduce the amount of}} nitrogen released into the environment thereby reducing eutrophication.|$|E

50|$|Typically, SNdN has slower ammonia and nitrate {{utilization}} rates {{as compared to}} separate basin designs because {{only a fraction of}} the total biomass is participating in either the nitrification or the denitrification steps. The SNdN limitation due to partial active biomass has led to research in novel bacteria and system designs. Huang achieved significant ammonia removal in an attached growth process with ciliated columns packed with granular sulfur where the <b>denitrifying</b> <b>bacteria</b> used the sulfur as the electron donor and nitrate as the electron acceptor. Another well established pathway is via autotrophic <b>denitrifying</b> <b>bacteria</b> in the process termed the Anammox process. It is typically used for high ammonia strength wastewater.|$|E

40|$|The {{population}} {{dynamics of the}} chemolithoautotrophic nitrifiers Nitrosomonas europaea and Nitrobacter winogradskyi were studied in gnotobiotic microcosms fed with ammonium {{in response to the}} presence or absence of the emergent macrophyte Glyceria maxima and the heterotrophic <b>denitrifying</b> <b>bacterium</b> Pseudomonas chlororaphis. By subjecting the plants to different day lengths, the effect of possibly limiting factors (i. e. oxygen and ammonium) on the interactions between the nitrifiers and <b>denitrifying</b> <b>bacterium</b> could be analysed. The presence of the plant had no effect on the growth of nitrifiers suggesting that, in addition to radial oxygen loss from the roots, other non-plant sources of oxygen (e. g. diffusion from the water layer) were important for nitrification. Potential nitrifying activities were suppressed by G. maxima due to ammonium uptake by the plants. Elongation of the day length in combination with the presence of G. maxima led to an increase in the number of P. chlororaphis. The presence of P. chlororaphis suppressed the growth of N. winogradskyi, but the growth of N. europaea and the potential nitrifying activities were not significantly affected. Potential denitrifying activities were stimulated by the plant, but showed no correlations with nitrifier activities or numbers. Apparently ammonium, and not oxygen, was the limiting factor for nitrification in the root zone of G. maxima. However, when the plant did not deplete the ammonium pool, P. chlororaphis could repress the nitrifiers indicating the latter's poor competitive status with respect to oxygen when the presence of root exudates allows for heterotrophic oxygen consumption.

40|$|Abstract—Citric acid {{is found}} along with uranyl in the {{subsurface}} of former nuclear facilities {{because of its}} use as a decontamination agent in the nuclear industry. Citrate’s metal chelating properties affect the mobility of uranyl in the subsurface and consequently, citrate biodegradation may significantly impact uranyl fate and transport. Under the non-growth conditions considered, low (micromolar) uranyl concentrations inhibit the biodegradation of citrate by Pseudomonas fluorescens, a common subsurface <b>denitrifying</b> <b>bacterium.</b> Additionally, uranyl is found readily associated with the cell envelope of P. fluorescens.
