In many areas of Asia, transplanting of rice is being replaced by direct seeding as farmers respond to increased labor cost and decreased water availability but weed control {{is one of the}} major constraints to direct seeding. So, to control weeds in direct seeded rice studies were designed. Experiments were conducted for two years to develop sustainable and economical methods for managing weeds in aerobic rice grown by direct-seeding at Student’s Farm, Department of Agronomy, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad during the years 2008 and 2009. The first experiment was laid out in RCBD having five weed control approaches; hand weeding, hoeing (with kasula), <b>inter</b> <b>row</b> cultivation with tine cultivator, <b>inter</b> <b>row</b> cultivation with spike hoe and chemical control with Nominee 100 SC along with control (no weeding).

Maximum fertile tillers were recorded in hand weeding (369. 73 m- 2) and were followed by hoeing (356. 94 m- 2) and tine cultivator (346. 78 m- 2). Hand pulling, hoeing, tine cultivator, Nominee and spike hoe gave 28, 25, 22, 12 and 6 % more number of kernels per panicle respectively.

In Mediterranean areas, viticulture is an important land use.

To encourage winegrowers and stakeholders to be reflective and adapt their vineyard practices, we evaluated the effects of three soil management practices (<b>inter</b> <b>row</b> plant cover duration, weeding and fertilization strategies) on soil functioning in 146 commercial plots distributed in Southern France, by a complementary set of biological and physico-chemical indicators.

The three soil management practices systematically influenced some nematode-based indicators, whereas other indicators were ascribable to a specific soil type or practice.

30|$|From the spectra, {{we can see}} the phonon signal band of GaAs IF has a high-energy {{side shift}} and shows an obvious {{variation}} in the shake peak numbers and intensity with increasing Sb spray time. Especially, the InAs/GaAs QD systems with the 15 -s Sb spray clearly display a decrease in shake peak numbers and a strengthening in the Raman intensity of GaAs IF signal. The results are assumed to originate from the Sb intermixing in the GaAs matrix, with varied compositions, stresses, and defects being manifested in the GaAs IF signal. Due to the lattice mismatch between InAs and GaAs, during the epitaxial growth, the strain will accumulate and result in the formation of lattice deformations or dislocations. These defects may be located in the InAs IF, inside the InAs QDs, or in the GaAs IF. Therefore, the up-shift, intensity, and peak number variations of the GaAs IF Raman signal can be explained in the following manner: during the Sb <b>spray</b> <b>treatment,</b> larger lattice constant GaAsSb is formed which results in reducing the QD/capping layer IF lattice mismatch. With the Sb spray time increased to 15 and 22.5  s, we can observe the obvious phonon signal for the Ga-Sb bonds located at the frequency of 230  cm− 1 [29, 30]. The presence of GaAsSb changes the stress distribution at the QD/cap IF, leading to a shift in the GaAs IF phonon line to higher energy. At a certain Sb <b>spray</b> <b>treatment,</b> the symmetry of the strain will achieve an optimum value, and the defects and dislocations will be reduced to a large degree. Furthermore, the uniformity of the GaAs IF In/Ga intermixing is enhanced. Therefore, the phonon signal peak of GaAs IF will be strengthened, as shown in the spectra; the 15 -s Sb <b>spray</b> <b>treatment</b> is just the case.|$|R

However, weights of cows and calves and condition scores of cows were not influenced by suppression of Haematobia irritans (L.) populations. Results show that cattle in northwest Florida can tolerate average populations of 3 ̆e 200 flies for 70 d with no adverse economic effects. <b>Spray</b> <b>treatments</b> providing the best fly control were Lintox-D and Ra-Vap. The most economical products for use were Del-Tox, Lintox-D, and Ra-Vap...|$|R
40|$|NYS IPM Type: Project ReportAdvanced {{generations of}} alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) cultivars and experimentals (entries) {{resistant}} to potato leafhopper (PLH), Empoasca fabae (Harris), were released in 1998 and planted in Ithaca that year. Entries released in 1999 were planted {{in a separate}} trial this spring. Both trials were designed as split-plots with the main plots as insecticide treatment vs. no treatment and the sub-plots as entries resistant and susceptible to PLH. In 1999 PLH populations went above threshold immediately prior to harvest 2 (28 July) in both trials. Yields in these trials were reduced overall due to severe drought. In the seeding year trial, plots in the <b>sprayed</b> <b>treatment</b> had negligible PLH adults, fewer nymphs, and lower PLH damage scores than plots in the unsprayed treatment; however, the differences in yield noted visually were not statistically significant. In the first production year, plots in the <b>sprayed</b> <b>treatment</b> had fewer PLH adults, nymphs, lower PLH damage scores, and higher percent bloom and yield than plots in the unsprayed treatment. In both the seeding year and first production year trials, the unsprayed resistant entries had lower yield, higher forage quality, and lower value per acre (-$ 15 /acre seeding year, -$ 24 /acre first production year) than the sprayed susceptible entries...|$|R
30|$|To {{test for}} H 2 O 2 {{production}} after abiotic stimulation, leaves of SHZ- 2 {{were subjected to}} a gelatin <b>spray</b> <b>treatment</b> and mechanical wounding with a needle (ESM Fig.  3). H 2 O 2 accumulated in faint spots after the water spray compared to the untreated, control leaf. There was also H 2 O 2 accumulation in areas directly surrounding the needle wounds at 24  h post-treatment. These results show that rice leaves produce H 2 O 2 after a variety of stimuli, including wounding and pathogen infection.|$|R
30|$|H 2 O 2 {{accumulation}} was visualized in leaf tissue using DAB {{as described}} (Thordal-Christensen et al. 1997). Twenty-one-day-old plants of cultivars LTH and SHZ- 2 were spray-inoculated with M. oryzae P 06 - 6. Leaves were collected at three time points after inoculation and then stained with DAB. Leaves from SHZ- 2 {{were subjected to}} a mock <b>spray</b> <b>treatment</b> or mechanical wounding with a needle, were harvested 24  h post-treatment, and then stained with DAB. Leaves were cleared of chlorophyll in 95 % ethanol and digital images were taken with a dissecting microscope.|$|R
