This paper investigates whether <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> market efficiency affects earnings management of multi-segment firm. We argue that diversified firms have more earnings management {{due to high}} information asymmetry. <b>Internal</b> <b>capital</b> market can enhance firm performance, whereas managers will not use accruals to boost earnings. We find that <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> market efficiency can reduce earnings management of diversified firms.

We find that while stock grants play an important role in motivating CEOs to make more efficient <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> allocation decisions, there is surprisingly no discernible influence of stock options. Our analysis supports the view that private benefits derived by managers are increasing in <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> misallocation. We also document a strong positive link between CEO incentive compensation and excess value of diversified firms suggesting that the diversification discount can be ameliorated with CEO incentive compensation.

40|$|The {{extent to}} which {{conglomerates}} face frictions in external capital markets has implications for their <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> allocation. We find that, during recessions, when external financing costs are higher, conglomerates improve the efficiency of <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> markets by increasing the allocation of funds to high q divisions relative to low q divisions. The improvement is significantly higher for conglomerates {{that are likely to}} face more binding financial constraints. This evidence suggests that although financial constraints impair managers' ability to undertake positive net present value projects, they improve the quality of project selection by reducing free cash flow and pressuring managers to fund the more valuable investment opportunities. It is consistent with theories stressing the benefits of <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> markets in the presence of external <b>capital</b> market imperfections. <b>Internal</b> <b>capital</b> market Conglomerate Financial constraint <b>Internal</b> <b>capital</b> allocation Diversification...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The paper's aim is {{to analyze}} excess returns {{generated}} by Canadian sell-offs and their links to changes in firms' <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> allocation efficiency to test the efficiency of <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> markets after assets divestitures. Design/methodology/approach – This study investigates {{the relationship between the}} level of the excess returns subsequent to sell-offs and changes in the <b>capital</b> allocated through <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> markets. The authors measure excess returns by calculating buy-and-hold abnormal (BHAR) returns up to three years after divestitures and test whether changes in value are related to changes in investment efficiency. The paper uses the relative value added by allocation (RVA) as developed by Rajan et al. to measure the variation in allocational efficiency of the <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> market. Findings – The study reveals that on average assets divestitures enable Canadian firms {{to keep up with the}} performance of their peers of the same industrial sector during the long-run post divestiture period. A closer look at the results shows that the variation of long-run post divestitures performance among Canadian firms is significantly and positively linked to changes in the allocational efficiency of the <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> markets. These results suggest that dismantling some parts of the <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> market does lead to improvements in firm value in the long run. Research limitations/implications – The sample is limited to a group of firms that sell off a portion of their assets. Further research could be conducted to determine whether other divestiture methods (spin-off, sell-off or equity carve-out) have any impact on <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> allocation efficiency and long run financial performance. Originality/Value – The paper adds to other studies examining the source of gains from divestitures by documenting the effects of changes in <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> allocation efficiency on the creation of long-term shareholder wealth.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{investment}} of diversified and focused firms under various capital market conditions. When external capital becomes more costly at the aggregate level, investment declines in focused firms but remains unchanged in diversified firms. This investment advantage enjoyed by diversified firms could attribute to both their easy access to external capital {{and their ability to}} substitute <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> markets for costly external markets. Consistent with the <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> market argument, our findings show that the investment advantage exists for diversified firms even after we control for their easy access to external markets. We also find that the role of internal markets in financing investment is more important for diversified firms that are more financially constrained in external markets. Finally, we find that the segment-level investment becomes more efficient in conglomerates' <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> markets under depressed external capital market conditions. Overall, our findings suggest that <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> allocation functions as a valuable and efficient substitute for diversified firms in a tightened external <b>capital</b> market. <b>Internal</b> <b>capital</b> markets Diversification Financial constraints...|$|R

In such firms, influence costs may be considerably higher than in IOFs of comparable size and scope, due to multiple principle—agency costs and heterogeneous member interests. Our arguments are supported by an empirical investigation of the organizational, governance, and property rights structures, which affect the degree of efficiency achieved by <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> markets in producer cooperative organizations. As a by-product of our empirical analysis, we are also able to identify the dimensions of stakeholder interest heterogeneity, which critically affect <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> market efficiency.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the primary function of headquarters in a multi-divisional enterprise is to run an <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> market in which scarce project finance is transferred from lagging units to those, which have strategic promise. Such a headquarters role is particularly relevant in multinational enterprises (MNEs). It is proposed that the granting of strategic independence to subsidiaries may reduce the ability of headquarters to control their resources and thereby reduce the efficiency of the <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> market. This is likely to have adverse effects, reducing and perhaps reversing the 'localisation' benefits of subsidiary strategic independence. Using a cross-sectional data set of UK subsidiaries of non-UK MNEs, strong evidence is found for the working of <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> markets. It appears that subsidiary strategic independence does impede the working of these markets. MNE-subsidiary relations <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> markets...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we look at}} the effect of CEO {{turnover}} on the divisional investment of multi-divisional firms. We predict that after CEO turnover, new CEOs will use different divisional investment policy and <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> allocation to realize strategy reorientation, improve firm performance or make more entrenchment. Furthermore, by looking at new CEO’s divisional preference at pre- and post-turnover period we try to investigate possible difference in the change of investment among divisions according to different extend of information asymmetry and incentive problems. We argue that specific relationship between a division and a new CEO plays an important role after the CEO turnover in determining the adjustment to previous divisional investment distortions.

Most studies have relied on indirect tests based on correlations between the cash flows and the investment of the subsidiaries. In contrast, we avoid the widespread criticisms of such specifications by providing direct tests {{that focus on the}} mechanisms through which internal reallocations of funds occur. We find that <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> markets are operative within multibank holding companies and that they are used to mitigate capital constraints faced by individual bank subsidiaries. It is shown that <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> management within a multibank holding company involves not only the movement of capital from better capitalized to less capitalized subsidiaries, but also the movement of assets (loans) from less capitalized to more capitalized subsidiaries by means of loan sales and purchases among the subsidiaries. This internal secondary loan market allows banks in holding companies to avoid the “lemons ” problem faced by stand-alone banks by making transactions with their affiliate banks. This second mechanism has been overlooked in the existing literature on the operation of <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> markets within banking organizations.

40|$|When {{external}} {{capital markets}} are stressed {{they may not}} reallocate resources between firms. We show that resource allocation within firms' <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> markets provides an important force countervailing financial market dislocation. Using data on US conglomerates we empirically verify that firms shift resources between industries in response to shocks to the financial sector. We estimate a structural model of <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> market to separately identify and quantify the forces driving the reallocation decision and how these forces interact with external capital market stress. The frictions in <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> markets drive a large wedge between productivity and investment: the weaker (stronger) division obtains too much (little) capital, as though it is 12 (9) percent more (less) productive than it really is. The cost of accessing external capital funds quadruple during extreme financial market dislocations, making resource allocation within firms significantly cheaper. The estimated model allows us to simulate the propagation of the 2007 / 2008 financial market dislocation. The counterfactual out of sample simulated data is remarkably consistent with the actual data and shows that improved resource allocation in <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> markets offset financial market stress during the recent financial crisis by 16 % to 30 % relative to firms with no <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> markets. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> {{markets in}} {{financial}} conglomerates {{by studying the}} responses of small banks to changes in monetary policy. I find that if a small bank operates on a stand-alone basis, then that bank’s loan growth becomes significantly more dependent on its own cash flows as monetary policy is tightened. In contrast, if a small bank operates under a multi-bank holding company with another bank with easy access to nonreservable funds, then the small bank’s loan growth does not become more sensitive to its own cash flows in periods of tight money. My evidence shows that <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> markets in financial conglomerates relax the constraints faced by affiliates unable to raise funds via liabilities that bear credit risk. Further analysis indicates that <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> markets have the potential of lessening the impact of Fed policies on bank lending activity. The paper also examines the role of <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> markets in influencing the investment allocation process of conglomerates. In a sample of constrained (unconstrained) multi-bank holding companies, comparisons across bank affiliates of the same conglomerate show that the funding of new loans becomes less (more) sensitive to affiliate-level cash flows for the worst affiliates relative to the best affiliates following a tightening.

This result is robust to including other controls, such as measures of information asymmetry, capital needs, relative valuation and firm size. Further, a higher use of external capital by diversified firms relative to single segment firms is associated with a higher excess value, but only for efficient <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> market users.

40|$|One {{distinguishing}} feature of <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> markets is {{their ability to}} reallocate funds in favour of the most profitable divisions (winner-picking). Yet, diversified firms often trade at a discount {{with respect to their}} focused counterparts. The literature has tried to explain the apparent misallocation of resources with lobbying activities or power struggles. We show that the diversification discount can be explained even in a model where resources are efficiently allocated ex post. When managers obtain utility from the funds under their purview, moving funds across divisions may diminish their incentives. The ex ante reduction in managerial incentives can more than offset the increase in firm value due to the ex post efficient reallocation of funds. If headquarters have some commitment power, it is in general optimal to commit not to reallocate at least a fraction of funds. As a result, the investment in a given division is (optimally) more sensitive to the division's cash flow than to other divisions' cash flow, as confirmed by the empirical studies on <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> markets. Our theory complements the view that links the diversification discount to the inefficient functioning of <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> markets. <b>Internal</b> <b>Capital</b> Markets; Managerial Incentives; Winner-Picking...|$|R
