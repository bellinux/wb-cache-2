40|$|Fluorescent base analogues {{comprise}} {{a group of}} increasingly important molecules for the investigation of nucleic acid structure, dynamics, and interactions with other molecules. Herein, {{we report on the}} quantum chemical calculation aided design, synthesis, and characterization of four new putative quadracyclic adenine analogues. The compounds were efficiently synthesized from a common intermediate through a two-step pathway with the Suzuki-Miyaura coupling as the key step. Two of the compounds, qAN 1 and qAN 4, <b>display</b> <b>brightnesses</b> (εΦF) of 1700 and 2300, respectively, in water and behave as wavelength-ratiometric pH probes under acidic conditions. The other two, qAN 2 and qAN 3, <b>display</b> lower <b>brightnesses</b> but exhibit polarity-sensitive dual-band emissions that could prove useful to investigate DNA structural changes induced by DNA-protein or -drug interactions. The four qANs are very promising microenvironment-sensitive fluorescent adenine analogues that <b>display</b> considerable <b>brightness</b> for such compounds. Polarity and pH probes: 2 -Aminopurine has long been the standard for fluorescent base analogues. Four new fluorescent probes suitable for the replacement of adenine in nucleic acids are presented. Based on their high structural similarity to their parent compound, quadracyclic adenine, they have the potential to be excellent A analogues. Their improved photophysical properties also suggest that they could be significantly brighter than 2 -aminopurine inside nucleic acid systems (see figure; ΦF: fluorescence quantum yield) ...|$|R

Simulations by Freytag, Steffen, & (2002) of the convective envelope of the star have shown that the fluctuations in the star’s luminosity may be caused by giant cell convection. A related question regarding the nature of Betelgeuse and supergiants in general is whether these stars may be magnetically active. If so, that may in turn also contribute to their variability. By performing detailed numerical simulations, I find that both linear kinematic and non-linear dynamo action are possible and that the non-linear magnetic field saturates at a value somewhat below equipartition: in the linear regime there are two modes of dynamo action. 1...|$|R

5000|$|Optical bonding {{is the use}} of an optical-grade {{adhesive}} to glue a {{glass to}} the top surface of a display. The main goal of optical bonding is to improve the display performance under outdoor environments. This method eliminates the air gap between the cover glass and the display. [...] Moreover, anti-reflective coating is often used in optical bonding glass. The real problem for display readability in outdoor environments is not the <b>display's</b> <b>brightness</b> but its contrast. Contrast means the ratio of the white level to the black level; in other words, the contrast ratio of display means the difference of light intensity between the brightest white pixel and the darkest black pixel. The main purpose of optical bonding is to increase the display's contrast ratio by reducing the amount of reflected ambient light.|$|R
