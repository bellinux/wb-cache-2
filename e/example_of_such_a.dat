5|$|Starbursts {{are often}} {{associated}} with merging or interacting galaxies. The prototype <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> starburst-forming interaction is M82, which experienced a close encounter with the larger M81. Irregular galaxies often exhibit spaced knots of starburst activity.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{automatically}} a draw if the player to move {{is not in}} check but has no legal move. This situation is called a stalemate. An <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> position {{is shown in the}} adjacent diagram.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{are often}} {{designed}} {{to mimic the}} transition state or intermediate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. This ensures that the inhibitor exploits the transition state stabilising effect of the enzyme, resulting in a better binding affinity (lower Ki) than substrate-based designs. An <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> transition state inhibitor is the antiviral drug oseltamivir; this drug mimics the planar nature of the ring oxonium ion in {{the reaction of the}} viral enzyme neuraminidase.|$|E

5|$|Stars {{condense}} from {{regions of}} space of higher matter density, yet those regions are less dense than within a vacuum chamber. These regions – known as molecular clouds – consist mostly of hydrogen, with about 23 to 28 percent helium {{and a few}} percent heavier elements. One <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> star-forming region is the Orion Nebula. Most stars form in groups of dozens {{to hundreds of thousands}} of stars.|$|E
5|$|Another way enzyme {{malfunctions}} {{can cause}} disease comes from germline mutations in genes coding for DNA repair enzymes. Defects in these enzymes cause cancer because cells are {{less able to}} repair mutations in their genomes. This causes a slow accumulation of mutations and results {{in the development of}} cancers. An <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> hereditary cancer syndrome is xeroderma pigmentosum, which causes the development of skin cancers in response to even minimal exposure to ultraviolet light.|$|E
5|$|Max Tegmark {{developed}} a four-part classification scheme {{for the different}} types of multiverses that scientists have suggested in various problem domains. An <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> model is the chaotic inflation model of the early universe. Another is the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. Parallel worlds are generated {{in a manner similar to}} quantum superposition and decoherence, with all states of the wave function being realized in separate worlds. Effectively, the multiverse evolves as a universal wavefunction. If the Big Bang that created our multiverse created an ensemble of multiverses, the wave function of the ensemble would be entangled in this sense.|$|E

5|$|On {{the surface}} of the white dwarf, the accreted gas will become {{compressed}} and heated. At some point the accumulated gas can reach the conditions necessary for hydrogen fusion to occur, producing a runaway reaction that will drive a portion of the gas from the surface. This would result in a (recurrent) nova explosion—a cataclysmic variable star—and the luminosity of the white dwarf rapidly would increase by several magnitudes for a period of several days or months. An <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> star system is RS Ophiuchi, a binary system consisting of a red giant and a white dwarf companion. RS Ophiuchi has flared into a (recurrent) nova on at least six occasions, each time accreting the critical mass of hydrogen needed to produce a runaway explosion.|$|E
5|$|The first {{region on}} either side of the bilayer is the {{hydrophilic}} headgroup. This portion of the membrane is completely hydrated and is typically around 0.8-0.9nm thick. In phospholipid bilayers the phosphate group is located within this hydrated region, approximately 0.5nm outside the hydrophobic core. In some cases, the hydrated region can extend much further, for instance in lipids with a large protein or long sugar chain grafted to the head. One common <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> modification in nature is the lipopolysaccharide coat on a bacterial outer membrane, which helps retain a water layer around the bacterium to prevent dehydration.|$|E
5|$|The winds on Saturn are {{the second}} fastest among the Solar System's planets, after Neptune's. Voyager data {{indicate}} peak easterly winds of 500m/s (1800km/h). In {{images from the}} Cassini spacecraft during 2007, Saturn's northern hemisphere displayed a bright blue hue, similar to Uranus. The color was most likely caused by Rayleigh scattering. Thermography has shown that Saturn's south pole has a warm polar vortex, the only known <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> phenomenon in the Solar System. Whereas temperatures on Saturn are normally −185°C, temperatures on the vortex often reach as high as −122°C, suspected to be the warmest spot on Saturn.|$|E

5|$|Apart from {{stimulating}} {{the development of}} urban areas, temples and religious buildings featured a number of unique aesthetic and structural features. The Temple of the Saintly Mother (圣母殿) and the Hall of Sacrifice of the Jin Temple (晋祠), located in a southeastern suburb of Taiyuan City, Shanxi province, are extant examples of early Song architecture. The Temple of the Saintly Mother is the main building of the Jin Temple, first built in the period between 1023 and 1032 and renovated in 1102. It has a double-eaved roof with nine ridges, and two dragon-heads with wide-open jaws biting {{the ends of the}} main ridge. The roof is supported by massive dougong brackets corresponding to drawings in Yingzao Fashi. The eaves of the Temple of the Saintly Mother curve upward slightly at each end, a characteristic of Song architecture. The columns of the façade, decorated with dragons that coil around the shafts, become progressively taller with increasing distance to either side of the central pair. The building has a porch around it, the sole <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> structure; another unique feature of the site is a cross-shaped bridge that leads to the Goddess Temple.|$|E
5|$|One area of {{clinical}} research {{is focused on}} treating the underlying disease pathology. Reduction of beta-amyloid levels is a common target of compounds (such as apomorphine) under investigation. Immunotherapy or vaccination for the amyloid protein is one treatment modality under study. Unlike preventative vaccination, the putative therapy {{would be used to}} treat people already diagnosed. It is based upon the concept of training the immune system to recognise, attack, and reverse deposition of amyloid, thereby altering the course of the disease. An <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> vaccine under investigation was ACC-001, although the trials were suspended in 2008. Another similar agent is bapineuzumab, an antibody designed as identical to the naturally induced anti-amyloid antibody. However, immunotherapeutic agents have been found to cause some concerning adverse drug reactions, such as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. Other approaches are neuroprotective agents, such as AL-108, and metal-protein interaction attenuation agents, such as PBT2. A TNFα receptor-blocking fusion protein, etanercept has showed encouraging results.|$|E
5|$|One type of {{sympatric}} speciation involves crossbreeding of two related species {{to produce a}} new hybrid species. This is not common in animals as animal hybrids are usually sterile. This is because during meiosis the homologous chromosomes from each parent are from different species and cannot successfully pair. However, it {{is more common in}} plants because plants often double their number of chromosomes, to form polyploids. This allows the chromosomes from each parental species to form matching pairs during meiosis, since each parent's chromosomes are represented by a pair already. An <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> speciation event is when the plant species Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis arenosa crossbred to give the new species Arabidopsis suecica. This happened about 20,000 years ago, and the speciation process has been repeated in the laboratory, which allows the study of the genetic mechanisms involved in this process. Indeed, chromosome doubling within a species may be a common cause of reproductive isolation, as half the doubled chromosomes will be unmatched when breeding with undoubled organisms.|$|E

5|$|Work {{on the new}} {{fortification}} {{was completed}} in 1068. Probably at first a wooden keep was constructed, which was later replaced with a much stronger stone one. Lincoln Castle is very unusual in having two mottes, the only other surviving <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> design being at Lewes. To the south, where the Roman wall stands {{on the edge of}} a steep slope, it was retained partially as a curtain wall and partially as a revetment retaining the mottes. In the west, where the ground is more level, the Roman wall was buried within an earth rampart and extended upward to form the Norman castle wall. The Roman west gate (on the same site as the castle's west gate) was excavated in the 19th century but began to collapse on exposure, and so was re-buried.|$|E
