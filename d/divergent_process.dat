40|$|It is {{proposed}} that creativity {{can be enhanced}} {{through the use of}} interactive genetic algorithms (IGAs). Divergent and convergent thinking are important processes in creativity that we simulate through two separate IGA populations developed by different means. The convergent process hones in on specific designs, while the <b>divergent</b> <b>process</b> explore design possibilities in a fashion beyond pure mutation techniques typically used to introduce population diversity. This study uses Monte Carlo simulation to explore the effect of merging two populations developed by the divergent and convergent methods. The results suggest that population diversity benefits from these population combinations while not adversely affecting the ability of the user to find a goal design. This IGA has also been developed in Adobe Flash {{so that it can be}} deployed on the internet to conduct validation and studies of creativity...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a general technique for obtaining new results {{pertaining to the}} non-finite axiomatizability of behavioural (pre) congruences over process algebras from old ones. The proposed technique {{is based on a}} variation on the classic idea of reduction mappings. In this setting, such reductions are translations between languages that preserve sound (in) equations and (in) equational proofs over the source language, and reflect families of (in) equations responsible for the non-finite axiomatizability of the target language. The proposed technique is applied to obtain a number of new non-finite axiomatizability theorems in process algebra via reduction to Moller’s celebrated non-finite axiomatizability result for CCS. The limitations of the reduction technique are also studied. In particular, it is shown that prebisimilarity is not finitely based over CCS with the <b>divergent</b> <b>process</b> Ω, but that this result cannot be proved by a reduction to the non-finite axiomatizability of CCS modulo bisimilarity. ...|$|E

Green’s functions and propagators computed in a de Sitter invariant gauge are generally more complicated than in some noninvariant gauges. What is worse, solving the gauge-fixed field equations in a de Sitter invariant gauge generally leads to violations of the original, gauge invariant field equations. The most interesting free quantum field theories possess no normalizable, de Sitter invariant states. This precludes the existence of de Sitter invariant propagators. Even had such propagators existed, infrared <b>divergent</b> <b>processes</b> would still break de Sitter invariance...|$|R

This paper presents TightLip, a privacy management system that helps users define what data is sensitive and who is trusted to see it rather than forcing them to understand or predict how the interactions of their software packages can leak data. The key mechanism used by TightLip to detect and prevent breaches is the doppelganger process. Doppelgangers are sandboxed copy processes that inherit most, but not all, {{of the state of}} an original process. The operating system runs a doppelganger and its original in parallel and uses <b>divergent</b> <b>process</b> outputs to detect potential privacy leaks. Support for doppelgangers is compatible with legacy-code, requires minor modifications to existing operating systems, and imposes negligible overhead for common workloads.

The main objective is to anticipate a sawmill <b>divergent</b> <b>process</b> {{in order to enhance}} the production plan. From a virtual representation of the product, singularity features are extracted and their impact on the product virtual quality is assessed thanks to the Choquet integrals. Next, the visual quality is evaluated by merging singularity impacts and singularity number criterion using suitable operators. Three operators are compared to the mean operator which is the commonly used one when there is little knowledge on the decision process. Finally the measure is express in the Sawmill expert language using linguistic variables which give the possibility degree that the product belongs to each quality. This degree could be understood as the risk to attribute the concerned quality. It is finally used to determine which quality is to attribute to product in order to satisfy customer needs and maximize sawyers benefit by a linear programming algorithm...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to revisit the broad {{researches}} performed on income mobility. To that end, first, we synthesize the commonly used concepts and corresponding measures in three classes, namely, movement, temporal dependence and equalization of incomes. Second, since the unit of analysis is country, we reformulate the mobility indicators to take into account the countries sizes. Third, in the empirical approach, we compare income mobility in the SEE (South-Eastern Europe) region and in the EU (European Union) countries over the 1990 - 2009 time period. The results suggest that, in the long-term, income mobility is greater in the SEE than in the EU. However, the opposite holds in the last decade. Moreover, income mobility is mostly a <b>divergent</b> <b>process</b> in the SEE region, whereas the EU experienced a convergent mobility. In addition, unlike the EU, income mobility has disequalized longer-term incomes in the SEE region throughout the period of study. Accordingly, these results can serve as a basis for decision-making in the field of regional development policies that are used in the process of European integration...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSawmill {{production}} {{is characterized by}} divergent processes and coproduction. In this context, {{it is difficult for}} a production manager to establish a production plan which meets customer demand. This {{is one of the reasons}} why the North American lumber industry produces with a mainly make-to-stock strategy. The aim of this research is to evaluate the impact that a better classification of the raw material (logs) would have on sawmill agility. Using a mathematical model to create production plans, we evaluate the performance of the mill to meet the demand in light of the knowledge it has of the raw material. The process of softwood lumber {{production is}} one that shows interesting characteristics. Felled trees that have been limbed and cut to length arrive at a sawmill which then transforms this raw material (logs) into various products (lumber) of different standard 1 sizes and lengths. The sawing of a single log generates an assortment of different products (<b>divergent</b> <b>process)</b> simultaneously (coproduction). In North America, there is generally little classification of logs prior to sawing, whether at the log yard (location where the logs are stored before entering sawmill) or along the forest roads...|$|E

In three studies using autobiographical recall and experimental inductions, we revealed that both processes can explain why vicarious shame arises in different situations, what variation can be observed in the experience of vicarious shame, and how all vicarious shame can be related to a threat to the self. Results are integrated in a functional account of shame...|$|R

Crisis is defined as an empirically <b>divergent</b> <b>process.</b> The principal findings from this analysis are that: 1) three nations (France, Greece, and the United States) are experiencing a crisis according to this definition; 2) although the crisis potential is relatively high in all the OECD nations, there appears to be a critical region or threshold where the tendency towards crisis increases dramatically; 3) the time to reach equilibrium is generally quite long, indicating the opportunity for substantial policy intervention; and 4) Denmark stands out as a successful case where health costs have been contained.

By examining the $ 3 $-taxon case in some detail we illustrate that phylogeneticists have been "spoiled" {{in the sense of}} not having to think about the structural parameters in their models by virtue of the strong assumption that evolution is treelike. We show that there are not always good statistical reasons to prefer the usual class of treelike models over more general convergence-divergence models. Specifically we show many $ 3 $-taxon datasets can be equally well explained by supposing violation of the molecular clock due to change in the rate of evolution along different edges, or by keeping the assumption of a constant rate of evolution but instead assuming that evolution is not a purely <b>divergent</b> <b>process.</b> Given the abundance of evidence that evolution is not strictly treelike, our discussion is an illustration that as phylogeneticists we often need to think clearly about the structural form of the models we use.

40|$|Amelogenesis imperfecta is a {{group of}} {{disorders}} causing abnormalities in enamel formation in various phenotypes. Many mutations in the FAM 83 H gene have been identified to result in autosomal dominant hypocalcified amelogenesis imperfecta in different populations. However, the structure and function of FAM 83 H and its pathological mechanism have yet to be further explored. Evolutionary analysis is an alternative for revealing residues or motifs that are important for protein function. In the present study, we chose 50 vertebrate species in public databases representative of approximately 230 million years of evolution, including 1 amphibian, 2 fishes, 7 sauropsidas and 40 mammals, and we performed evolutionary analysis on the FAM 83 H protein. By sequence alignment, conserved residues and motifs were indicated, and the loss of important residues and motifs of five special species (Malayan pangolin, platypus, minke whale, nine-banded armadillo and aardvark) was discovered. A phylogenetic time tree showed the FAM 83 H <b>divergent</b> <b>process.</b> Positive selection sites in the C-terminus suggested that the C-terminus of FAM 83 H played certain adaptive roles during evolution.

40|$|Interactive Evolutionary Systems (IES) {{are capable}} of {{generating}} and evolving large numbers of alternative designs. When using such systems, users are continuously required {{to interact with the}} system by making evaluations and selections of the designs that are being generated and evolved. The evolutionary process is therefore led by the visual aesthetic intentions of the user. However, due to the limited size of the computer screen and fuzzy nature of aesthetic evaluations, evolution is usually a mutation-driven and <b>divergent</b> <b>process.</b> The convergent mechanisms typically found in standard Evolutionary Algorithms are more difficult to achieve with IES. To address this problem, this paper presents a computational framework that creates an IES with a higher level of convergence without requiring additional actions from the user. This can be achieved by incorporating a Neural Network based learning mechanism, called a General Regression Neural Network (GRNN), into an IES. GRNN analyses the user's aesthetic evaluations during the interactive evolutionary process and is thereby able to approximate their implicit aesthetic intentions. The approximation is a regression of aesthetic appeals conditioned on the corresponding designs. This learning mechanism allows the framework to infer which designs the users may find desirable. For the users, this reduces the tedious work of evaluating and selecting designs. Experiments have been conducted using the framework to support the process of parametric tuning of facial characters. In this paper we analyze the performance of our approach and discuss the issues that we believe are essential for improving the usability and efficiency of IES. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
