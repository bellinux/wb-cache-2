5|$|Breckinridge {{left behind}} $15,000 in debts, {{and with the}} nation still <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>throes</b> <b>of</b> the Panic of 1819, his assets were not enough {{to pay off the}} obligations. His wife, who also fell ill and was {{pregnant}} with the couple's sixth child, was so depressed because of his death and her subsequent financial straits that she suffered a miscarriage. She and the children moved in with Cabell's widowed mother at Cabell's Dale. For several years, she was dependent upon her in-laws for survival; Breckinridge's brother, Robert, assumed Cabell's debts, which he paid in full in 1832.|$|E

The Dutch had had important business interests in the country, especially in petroleum. Muller stayed here until early 1924 when he was appointed envoy to Czechoslovakia. In Prague he was also involved in Dutch business affairs, inter alia looking after the interests of the Dutch electrotechnical firm Philips.|$|E

25|$|Hamlet, Op. 67b (1891), {{incidental}} {{music for}} Shakespeare's play. The score uses music borrowed from Tchaikovsky's overture {{of the same}} name, {{as well as from}} his Symphony No. 3, and from The Snow Maiden, in addition to original music that he wrote specifically for a stage production of Hamlet. The two vocal selections are a song that Ophelia sings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>throes</b> <b>of</b> her madness, and a song for the First Gravedigger to sing as he goes about his work.|$|E
25|$|Tocqueville's {{penetrating}} analysis {{sought to}} understand the peculiar nature of US political life. <b>In</b> describing <b>the</b> US, he agreed with thinkers such as Aristotle and Montesquieu that the balance of property determined the balance of political power, but his conclusions after that differed radically from those of his predecessors. Tocqueville tried {{to understand why the}} US was so different from Europe <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last <b>throes</b> <b>of</b> aristocracy. <b>The</b> US, <b>in</b> contrast to <b>the</b> aristocratic ethic, was a society where hard work and money-making was the dominant ethic, where the common man enjoyed a level of dignity which was unprecedented, where commoners never deferred to elites, and where what he described as crass individualism and market capitalism had taken root to an extraordinary degree.|$|R
25|$|By 1924, Pound and his wife, {{the former}} Dorothy Shakespear, {{had moved from}} Paris to Rapallo, Italy. Rudge, now <b>in</b> <b>the</b> full <b>throes</b> <b>of</b> her {{enduring}} love affair with Pound, visited him several times. From this time Pound seems to have divided his time equally between Rudge and his wife, a situation which was to continue until the Second World War. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Spring of 1925, Rudge was forced {{to pull out of}} a planned concert tour of the United States as she was pregnant by Pound.

40|$|Through {{the case}} of a Puerto Rican public housing project, Las Gladiolas, this article argues that demolitions should be {{understood}} as long-term physical and emotional processes of home un making. It focuses on the diverse appearances of lifts and stairs in public housing representations, residents' everyday life, memories, and legal arguments to tell a nuanced story about their meaning and materiality <b>in</b> <b>the</b> un making of home. Drawing together strands from critical geographies of architecture, geographies of home, and emotional geographies, these internal building technologies are approached as active mediators <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way personal and communal life was negotiated and remembered, as well as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> anti-displacement struggle unfolding <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final <b>throes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> buildings' existence. The loss of home through long-term deterioration and displacement is situated in its historical and cultural context, since the island's public housing trajectory has been continually framed by dominant national aspirations of homeownership...|$|R

Only Spectravideo and Yamaha briefly marketed MSX machines in the U.S. Spectravideo's MSX enjoyed very little success, and Yamaha's CX5M model, built to interface with various types of MIDI equipment, was billed more as a digital music tool than a standard personal computer.|$|E
25|$|The Nootka Crisis was an {{international}} incident and political {{dispute between the}} Spanish Empire and the Kingdom of Great Britain, triggered {{by a series of}} events that took place during the summer of 1789 at Nootka Sound. Spain seized some British commercial ships engaged in the fur trade in an uncolonized coastline area to which Spain claimed ownership. Britain rejected the Spanish claims and used its greatly superior naval power to threaten a war and win the dispute. Spain, a rapidly fading military power, was unable to depend upon its longtime ally, France, which was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>throes</b> <b>of</b> the French Revolution.|$|E
25|$|In the Victorian period, {{the quality}} of erotic fiction was much below that of the {{previous}} century—it was largely written by 'hacks'. Some works, however, borrowed from established literary models, such as Dickens. It also featured a curious form of social stratification. Even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>throes</b> <b>of</b> orgasm, the social distinctions between master and servant (including form of address) were scrupulously observed. Significant elements of sado-masochism were present in some examples, perhaps reflecting {{the influence of the}} English public school, where flagellation was routinely used as a punishment. These clandestine works were often anonymous or written under a pseudonym, and sometimes undated, thus definite information about them often proves elusive.|$|E

Along with the filmmakers, musicians, actors, architects, playwrights, composers, painters and novelists who filled Berlin’s cafes, photographers too were caught <b>in</b> <b>the</b> blooming. Encouraged by {{a friend of his}} stepfather’s family who “believed to have discovered a visual talent in me,” Bock-Schroeder wrote in a self-deprecating autobiographical sketch, the fledgling photographer borrowed 150 Reichmarks from his benefactor and enrolled in an apprentice program at the renowned Atelier Binder photo studios. The studio was famous for having nurtured the talents of such prominent German photographers as Erich Balg, Sonja Goergi, Hubs Floter, Friedrich Aschenbrauch and Joe Niczky. The apprenticeship taught him every- thing about the operation of a photo studio, but little about the art of taking pictures.|$|R

25|$|In {{fact the}} essence of her art was refinement. The term seems odd for a {{performer}} whose imagination and means of expression were so prodigious. She was eminently capable of the grand gesture; still, judging strictly from the evidence of her recordings, we know (and her few existing film clips confirm) that her power flowed not from excess but from unbroken concentration, unfaltering truth in the moment. It flowed also from irreproachable musicianship. People say that Callas would not hesitate to distort a vocal line for dramatic effect. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>throes</b> <b>of</b> operatic passion plenty of singers snarl, growl, whine, and shriek. Callas {{was not one of}} them. She found all she needed in the notes.|$|E

50|$|Few Roman coins {{reach the}} artistic {{peaks of the}} best Greek coins, but they survive in vast numbers and their {{iconography}} and inscriptions form a crucial source {{for the study of}} Roman history, and the development of imperial iconography, as well as containing many fine examples of portraiture. They penetrated to the rural population of the whole Empire and beyond, with barbarians on the fringes of the Empire making their own copies. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Empire medallions <b>in</b> precious metals began to be produced in small editions as imperial gifts, which are similar to coins, though larger and usually finer in execution. Images in coins initially followed Greek styles, with gods and symbols, but <b>in</b> <b>the</b> death <b>throes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Republic first Pompey and then Julius Caesar appeared on coins, and portraits of the emperor or members of his family became standard on imperial coinage.

2500|$|Having {{considered}} the possibility {{at the end of}} the second season, Cleese left the Flying Circus {{at the end of the}} third.

He was also finding Chapman, who was at that point <b>in</b> <b>the</b> full <b>throes</b> <b>of</b> alcoholism, difficult to work with. According to an interview with Idle, [...] "It was on an Air Canada flight on the way to Toronto, when John (Cleese) turned to all of us and said 'I want out.' Why? I don't know. He gets bored more easily than the rest of us. He's a difficult man, not easy to be friendly with. He's so funny because he never wanted to be liked.

40|$|The ‘Franklin expedition’ of 1845 {{set out to}} {{establish}} a ‘northwest passage’ between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans but ended with the deaths of all 129 crewmen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grimmest of circumstances. The hypothesis that lead poisoning {{may have contributed to}} the disaster is examined by re-analysis of the bone-lead content of seven skeletons in order to model statistically <b>the</b> likely variation <b>in</b> lead burden across the whole crew. Comparison of the estimated lead burdens with present-day data that associates lead with cognitive and physical morbidity suggests that a proportion of the crew may have experienced few or no adverse effects whilst those with higher burdens may have suffered some significant debility. It is unclear whether such debility would have been incapacitating or exceptional for the lead-contaminated environment of nineteenth-century Britain. Whilst lead alone may not have caused the disaster, it is proposed that high levels of lead may have interacted with other factors including dietary insufficiencies and individual constitutional differences to render some, but not all, of the crew more vulnerable to debility <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final <b>throes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> expedition...|$|R
25|$|The Socialist Party of America was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>throes</b> <b>of</b> a {{membership}} decline throughout {{the decade of}} the 1920s, the communist left wing of the organization having been suspended, expelled, or split from the organization beginning with the seminal 1919 Emergency National Convention of the party. Dues-paying membership fell during this period from more than 100,000 to less than 10,000. The party's finances were similarly deeply affected and the organization felt pressed to explore new means of reaching an increasingly apathetic public. At its December 1926 quarterly meeting the governing National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party decided to erect a radio broadcasting station as a memorial to its recently deceased co-founder, Eugene V. Debs, who had died in October of the previous year.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of Hermann Bock, several friends of his testified at Haarmann's trial that, prior to Haarmann's arrest, they had been {{actively}} dissuaded from filing a missing person report upon the youth with police; these witnesses testified that Haarmann was insistent on filing the report himself (he had never done so). Other witnesses testified to having acquired various personal possessions belonging to the youth from Haarmann. In addition, a tailor testified at Haarmann's trial to having been asked by Haarmann to alter the suit. Haarmann repeatedly contradicted himself regarding his claims as to how he had acquired the youth's possessions. It is likely that Haarmann chose to deny this murder due to evidence suggesting the murder had been premeditated, {{as opposed to being}} committed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>throes</b> <b>of</b> passion. He had known the youth for several years prior to his murder, and Bock was known to be heterosexual. Due to his denial of having committed this particular murder, Haarmann was acquitted.|$|E
25|$|The Clock Tower was {{conceived}} {{within five years}} of the completion of Herne Bay's first pier of 1832, when the town was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>throes</b> <b>of</b> its initial popularity and development. Herne Bay historian Mike Bundock suggests a possible inspiration for the unusual design of this tower. On the back of 31 Marine Terrace, next door to Mrs Thwaytes' holiday residence, was a Royal Exchange Assurance lead firemark badge which bore {{a picture of the}} Royal Exchange tower, designed by Edward Jarman in 1721. Mrs Thwaytes was already familiar with the Royal Exchange tower, as she had lived close to it during her marriage. In 1836, possibly inspired by the success of the nearby pier and the grandeur of this image, Mrs Thwaytes requested the young architect Edwin James Dangerfield (1807–1879) of London and Herne Bay to draw a plan of a tower in the style of a Grecian temple with a clock at the top.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo speed {{across the}} Nevada desert. Duke, under the {{influence}} of mescaline, complains of a swarm of giant bats, before going through the pair's inventory of psychoactive drugs. Shortly afterward, the duo stop to pick up a young hitchhiker, and explain what they are doing. Duke has been assigned by an unnamed magazine to travel to Las Vegas and cover the Mint 400 motorcycle race. However, they have also decided {{to take advantage of the}} trip by purchasing a large number of drugs, and rent a red Chevrolet Impala convertible. The young man soon becomes terrified of the antics of the duo, and flees on foot. Trying to reach Vegas before the hitchhiker can go to the police, Gonzo gives Duke part of a sheet of Sunshine Acid, then informs him that there is little chance of making it before <b>the</b> drug kicks <b>in.</b> By <b>the</b> time they reach the strip, Duke is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> full <b>throes</b> <b>of</b> his trip, and barely makes it through the check-in, all the while hallucinating that the hotel clerk is a moray eel, and that his fellow bar patrons are lizards <b>in</b> <b>the</b> depths of an orgy.|$|R
40|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> early <b>throes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Recession <b>in</b> 2008, {{nearly half}} of all New York City {{residents}} reported difficulty affording needed food (48 percent), a record high since the start of polling for this indicator <b>in</b> 2003. <b>The</b> very next year, as stimulus funding and other relief measures were put in place, and as a slow economic recovery commenced, the percentage of New York City residents reporting difficulty affording needed food began to drop.

(This difference of three percentage points represents an overall decline of nine percent.) Although these findings give some cause for optimism, they mask the harsh and very different reality in which New York City's most vulnerable residents find themselves. This year's NYC Hunger Experience report reveals a tale of two cities, wherein the struggles of low-income and unemployed New Yorkers to keep food on the table have intensified even as the difficulties of those better off continue to improve...|$|R
