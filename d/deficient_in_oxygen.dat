40|$|Autophagy defects {{resulting}} in inflammation {{appear to be}} a key feature in the pathogenesis of Crohn colitis. An inflammatory colitis indistinguishable from Crohn disease is described in patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). Patients with CGD have a mutated NADPH complex and are therefore <b>deficient</b> <b>in</b> reactive <b>oxygen</b> species (ROS) production; however, the underlying mechanism for the inflammatory colitis in CGD remained unknown. In a recent study, our group reported that NADPH-dependent ROS deficiency results in autophagic dysfunction that subsequently contributes to increased IL 1 B/interleukin 1 beta production. Mice <b>deficient</b> <b>in</b> the NADPH-complex component NCF 4 /p 40 phox, and CGD patients with a defect in NCF 4 display minimal recruitment of LC 3 to phagosomes in response to internalized bacteria and fungi. Human monocytes from patients with CGD with defective LC 3 recruitment show increased IL 1 B production after LPS stimulation. Blocking IL 1 protects NCF 4 -deficient mice from experimental colitis; importantly, improved clinical outcome in 2 CGD patients with colitis is also observed with IL 1 blockade. Moreover, blocking IL 1 restores defective autophagy in CGD mice and cells from patients with CGD. Thus, autophagic dysfunction underlies the pathogenesis of granulomatous colitis in CGD, and blocking IL 1 can be used to treat CGD colitis...|$|R

During the first winter, dissolved oxygen declined to very low concentrations, generally about 0. 5 to 0. 15 ppm, in midlake and other sampling locations by mid to late January. Dead invertebrates and fish (suckers, Catostomus sp.) were seen at two locations where holes were drilled through the ice for habitat measurements. Two radio-tagged Arctic grayling remained in two small areas with higher oxygen concentrations of about 2. 6 to 10 ppm throughout the period of ice cover. These apparent oxygen refugia were located off the mouths of two major tributary inlets, Red Rock Creek and Grayling Creek. <b>In</b> contrast, <b>oxygen</b> concentrations remained relatively high, generally above 5 ppm, beneath ice cover through the winter of 1995 - 1996. Radio-tagged fish located by telemetry during this second winter—four Arctic grayling, seven cutthroat trout, and two burbot—remained widely distributed through the lake. Differences <b>in</b> <b>oxygen</b> concentrations beneath ice cover appeared related to conditions which favored greater growth of macrophyte vegetation during the preceding summer and fall, and effects of snow and ice cover on light penetration during winter...|$|R
40|$|Tyk 2, {{a member}} of the Jak family of protein {{tyrosine}} kinases, is critical for the biological actions of alpha/beta interferon (IFN-α/β). Although Tyk 2 −/− mice are phenotypically normal, they exhibit abnormal responses to inflammatory challenges in a variety of cells isolated from Tyk 2 −/− mice. The reported phenotypic alterations in both Tyk 2 -null cells and mice are consistent with the possibility that the expression of this tyrosine kinase may regulate mitochondrial function. We report here that Tyk 2 -null pro-B cells are markedly <b>deficient</b> <b>in</b> basal <b>oxygen</b> consumption and exhibit a significant decrease in steady-state cellular ATP levels compared to wild-type cells. Tyk 2 -null cells also exhibit impaired complex I, III, and IV function of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Reconstitution of Tyk 2 -null pro-B cells with either the wild type or a kinase-inactive mutant of Tyk 2 restores basal mitochondrial respiration. By contrast, the kinase activity of Tyk 2 is required for maintenance of both complex I-dependent mitochondrial respiration as well as induction of apoptosis in cells incubated with IFN-β. Consistent with the role of Tyk 2 in the regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat 3, expression of a constitutively active Stat 3 can restore the mitochondrial respiration in Tyk 2 -null cells treated with IFN-β. Finally, Tyk 2 −/− mice show decreased exercise tolerance compared to wild-type littermates. Our results implicate a novel role for Tyk 2 kinase and Stat 3 phosphorylation in mitochondrial respiration...|$|R

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the role of HIF- 1 in the cellular response to redox modulation via the inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation. We demonstrate that manipulation of redox in air, achieved by inhibiting cytochrome oxidase with cyanide, induces HIF- 1 mediated transcription in wild-type CHO and HT 1080 human tumour cells but not <b>in</b> CHO cells <b>deficient</b> <b>in</b> the <b>oxygen</b> responsive, HIF- 1 alpha sub-unit of HIF- 1. Hypoglycaemia attenuates cyanide-mediated transcription in non-transformed HIF- 1 wild-type CHO cells but not the human tumour derived cell line. Cells lacking either HIF- 1 alpha, or the second composite sub-unit of HIF- 1, HIF- 1 beta, were markedly {{more sensitive to the}} combined stress of perturbed redox and hypoglycaemia than wild-type cells. As such conditions together with hypoxia are prevalent in tumours, these data suggest that HIF- 1 may have a protective role in adaptation to the tumour micro-environment. In support of this we demonstrate that HIF- 1 alpha deficient cells are less tumorigenic than wild-type cells. They showed a reduced growth rate when grown as xenografts in nude mice. This was not related to vascular parameters that were identical to those found in HIF- 1 wild-type tumours. The HIF- 1 deficient tumours lacked focal expression of Glut- 1 in hypoxic tumour regions. Compromised glucose uptake and metabolic adaptation to the tumour micro-environment may form the basis of the reduced tumorigenicity associated with these cells...|$|R
50|$|SDSS J102915+172927 or Caffau's star is a {{population}} II {{star in the}} galactic halo, seen in the constellation Leo. It is about 13 billion years old, {{making it one of}} the oldest stars in the Galaxy. At the time of its discovery, it had the lowest metallicity of any known star. It is small (less than 0.8 solar masses), <b>deficient</b> <b>in</b> carbon, nitrogen, <b>oxygen,</b> and completely devoid of lithium. Because carbon and oxygen provide a fine structure cooling mechanism that is critical in the formation of low-mass stars, the origins of Caffau's star are somewhat mysterious. It has been suggested, both for theoretical and observational reasons, that the formation of low-mass stars in the interstellar medium requires a critical metallicity somewhere between 1.5×10−8 and 1.5×10−6. The metallicity of Caffau's star is less than 6.9×10−7. According to Schneider et al., cooling by dust rather than the fine structure lines of CII and OI may have enabled the creation of such low-mass, metal-poor stars in the early universe. The absence of lithium implies past temperatures of at least two million Kelvins.|$|R
40|$|Nitrate {{contamination}} of groundwater arises from anthropogenic activities, such as, fertilizer and animal manure applications and infiltration of wastewater/leachates. During migration of wastewater and leachates, the vadose zone (zone residing above the groundwater table), {{is considered to}} facilitate microbial denitrification. Particle voids in vadose zone are <b>deficient</b> <b>in</b> dissolved <b>oxygen</b> as the voids are partially filled by water and the remainder by air. Discontinuities in liquid phase would also restrict oxygen diffusion and therefore facilitate denitrification in the vadose/unsaturated soil zone. The degree of saturation of soil specimen (S (r)) quantifies the relative volume of voids filled with air and water. Unsaturated specimens have S (r) values ranging between 0 and 100 %. Earlier studies from naturally occurring nitrate losses in groundwater aquifers in Mulbagal town, Kolar District, Karnataka, showed that the sub-surface soils composed of residually derived sandy soil; hence, natural sand was chosen in the laboratory denitrification experiments. With a view to understand the role of vadose zone in denitrification process, experiments are performed with unsaturated sand specimens (S (r) = 73 - 90 %) whose pore water was spiked with nitrate and ethanol solutions. Experimental results revealed 73 % S (r) specimen facilitates nitrate reduction to 45 mg/L in relatively short durations of 5. 5 - 7. 5 h using the available natural organic matter (0. 41 % on mass basis of sand); consequently, ethanol addition did not impact rate of denitrification. However, at higher S (r) values of 81 and 90 %, extraneous ethanol addition (C/N = 0. 5 - 3) was needed to accelerate the denitrification rates...|$|R

40|$|The Newark Bay Estuary in {{northern}} New Jersey contains {{one of the}} largest urban wetland complexes in the United States, but the majority of the wetlands and habitats have been lost due to urbanization and industrialization. Field and laboratory research was conducted to understand the impacts of human activities on the biogeochemistry of nutrients and heavy metals in the urban estuary. Concentrations of dissolved nutrients such as nitrate, ammonia, and phosphate were higher in the Hackensack River than in the Passaic River or the Newark Bay, while the Hackensack River was more <b>deficient</b> <b>in</b> dissolved <b>oxygen.</b> Sediment oxygen demand and mobilization of nutrients were higher in sediments with higher organic matter content as a result of microbial decomposition of organic matter. Heavy metals (Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn) and organic matter were more enriched in finer sediment grains such as silt and clay. There were positive correlations among heavy metals as well as organic matter in sediments. The results suggest that fine grained sediments, which can be readily suspended and transported during tidal cycles, may {{play a significant role in}} biogeochemical cycling of nutrients and heavy metals in the urban estuary. It appears that the current sources of nutrients and heavy metals in the water and sediment of the Newark Bay Estuary are mainly domestic effluents from sewage treatment plants during non-storm periods as well as combined sewer overflows during storm events, but further research including more frequent and pervasive water and sediment quality monitoring during dry and wet periods is needed...|$|R
40|$|The {{first layer}} of innate {{immunity}} in plants is initiated through {{the perception of}} microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors. MAMP/DAMP perception initiates downstream defense responses, a process which ultimately leads to pattern triggered immunity, as reviewed in {{the first chapter of}} this thesis. In the second chapter of this thesis, based on a deep-sequencing expression profiling approach, a number of hitherto overlooked genes have been identified that are induced in wild type Arabidopsis seedlings upon treatment with both the MAMP, flg 22, and the DAMP, AtPep 1. This implies the possible involvement of the corresponding gene products in innate immunity. Four of them, named PP 2 -B 13, ACLP 1, SERP 1 and GRP 89, respectively, were studied in more detail. Homozygous mutant lines for the genes encoding these proteins were obtained and analyzed. The mutants pp 2 -b 13, aclp 1, serp 1 and grp 89 exhibited an increased susceptibility to infection by the virulent pathogen P. syringae pv. tomato DC 3000 and also by its avirulent hrcC mutant. Furthermore, it was observed that the aclp 1 mutant was <b>deficient</b> <b>in</b> ethylene production upon flg 22 treatment, while the mutants pp 2 -b 13, serp 1 and grp 89 were <b>deficient</b> <b>in</b> reactive <b>oxygen</b> species production. As mentioned, in addition to MAMPs, plants can sense and recognize DAMPs, i. e. endogenous elicitors which activate the immune system in response to biotic and also abiotic stimuli. So far, eight peptides have been described as DAMPs or endogenous danger peptides in Arabidopsis thaliana, named AtPeps 1 - 8. These peptides are derived from precursor proteins called the AtPROPEPs. The leucine-rich-repeat receptor kinases, AtPEPR 1 and AtPEPR 2, act as the receptors for the AtPep peptides. In the third chapter of this thesis, promoter-GUS reporter constructs were used to study the expression pattern of the genes encoding the AtPROPEPs as well as the AtPEPRs under biotic and abiotic stress, including AtPep 1, flg 22, Methyl jasmonate, and NaCl treatments. We found that the genes for the two AtPEPR receptors were differentially regulated in response to MAMPs (flg 22) and DAMPs (AtPEP 1). In addition, we showed that the activation pattern of the genes encoding the eight AtPROPEPs was totally different, despite the similarity {{of the members of the}} Pep family. This allowed us to classify the activity of the AtPROPEP promoters, based on their differential response to biotic and abiotic stimuli...|$|R

This investigation distinguished between these possibilities. Aerotaxis was absent in a cyo cyd strain of Escherichia coli that lacked both cytochrome o and cytochrome d, which are the terminal oxidases for the branched electron transport system in E. coli. Aerotaxis, measured by either a spatial or temporal assay, was normal in E. coli strains that had a cyo+ or cyd+ gene or both. The membrane potential of all oxidase-positive strains was approximately - 170 mV in aerated medium at pH 7. 5.

Class I mutants were <b>deficient</b> <b>in</b> transformation and heterologous transduction with phage PBS 1 but were transducible with homologous donors at nearly the wild-type frequency. They were blocked in donor-recipient complex (DRC) formation but formed essentially normal amounts of double-strand fragments (DSF) and single-strand fragments (SSF). The class IIa strain was <b>deficient</b> <b>in</b> transformation and PBS 1 transduction, and formed DRC which was normal by all available physical and biological criteria. Class IIb mutants were <b>deficient</b> <b>in</b> transformation and PBS 1 transduction, and failed to form DRC. They did produce DSF and SSF. Class III mutants were <b>deficient</b> <b>in</b> transformation, were normal in PBS 1 transduction, and formed DRC which was physically indistinguishable from that of the Rec+ parent although with slightly lowered donor-type transforming activity. Class IV strains were <b>deficient</b> <b>in</b> PBS 1 transduction but were transformed at nearly the wild-type efficiency. None of the mutant strains was <b>deficient</b> <b>in</b> the adenosine triphosphate-dependent deoxyribonuclease...|$|R
