50|$|This is an {{approximate}} equation that {{is derived from}} the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (written in spherical coordinate system) and describes the motion of the radius of the bubble R as a function of time t. Here, μ is the viscosity, p the pressure, and γ the surface tension. The over-dots represent time derivatives. This equation, though approximate, has been shown to give good estimates on the motion of the bubble under the acoustically driven field except during the final stages of collapse. Both simulation and experimental measurement show that during the critical final stages of collapse, the bubble wall velocity exceeds the speed of sound of the gas inside the bubble. Thus a more detailed analysis of the bubble's motion is needed beyond Rayleigh-Plesset to explore the additional energy focusing that an <b>internally</b> <b>formed</b> shock wave might produce.|$|E
5000|$|Reframing the {{conception}} of modern Arab identity from a confrontation between two undifferentiated cultures, the book closely reads [...] "foundational" [...] Arabic texts from turn of the centuryto demonstrate that the ideology and discourses of Arab subjectivity were <b>internally</b> <b>formed</b> within the Ottoman Empire {{at a time of}} radical transformations in governance and political economy. Sheehi locates the battle for [...] "self" [...] and [...] "other" [...] outside of the [...] "colonial encounter" [...] between Western colonizer and Eastern colonized. Instead, the dialectic between Self and Othertranspired internally—epistemologically and discursively—on a plane of dynamic cultural and social formations within Ottoman Arab society and polity during the Tanzimat. Sheehi proposes that the concept of cultural [...] "failure" [...] is inherent to the ways modern Arab intellectuals critically reorganized and redefined Arab subjectivity during modernity. Examining a host of varying sources including Arab fiction and commentary from the Arab Press, Sheehi maps out a [...] "formula" [...] for Arab reform during 19th and 20th century al-nahda, which predicates [...] "progress and civilization" [...] as [...] "proleptic" [...] teleological endpoints. Linguistically and semiotically structuring this formula was an axiomatic [...] "nomenclature of reform" [...] that was found in all Arab reform writing and thought despite the ideological, sectarian, political, or national position of the author. This commonality, Sheehi reveals, is due to that historical and political fact that all reform paradigms during the late Ottoman and Mandate periods arose from a fundamental epistemology of Arab modernity; a hybridized but still thorough modern form of modernity that Sheehi states was [...] "autogenetic." ...|$|E

30|$|In {{the above}} example [14], as the channel diameters of H-ZSM- 5 {{are small and}} {{relatively}} uniform, {{there is not much}} internal space for the coke building up, whereas the larger inner cavity space allows the H-SAPO- 34 to accumulate more coke species inside. It {{should be noted that the}} volume of coke storage here is not directly correlated with the coke capacity of zeolite. In contrast, due to the uniformly distributed channel size, H-ZSM- 5 would possess a much higher coke tolerance capacity, this is because in principle, chemicals with larger than the channel diameter size are hardly formed inside [12, 13, 22, 25]. For H-SAPO- 34, the smaller pore opening and much larger inner cavity make it difficult to move those <b>internally</b> <b>formed</b> large coke species to outside space, thus eventually leadint to an inreversible catalyst deactivation [10, 12, 13, 34, 35, 36].|$|E

40|$|A {{mechanistic}} toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic {{model for}} acute toxic effects (immobilization, mortality) of the organothiophosphate insecticide diazinon in Daphnia magna is presented. The model was parameterized using measured {{external and internal}} (whole-body) concentrations of diazinon, its toxic metabolite diazoxon, and the inactive metabolite 2 -isopropyl- 6 -methyl- 4 -pyrimidinol, plus acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity measured during exposure to diazinon in vivo. The toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic model provides a coherent picture from exposure to the resulting toxic effect on an organism level through <b>internally</b> <b>formed</b> metabolites and the effect on a molecular scale. A very fast reaction of diazoxon with AChE (pseudo first-order inhibition rate constant ki?=? 3. 3 ?h- 1) compared with a slow formation of diazoxon (activation rate constant kact?=? 0. 014 ?h- 1) {{was responsible for the}} high sensitivity of D. magna toward diazinon. Recovery of AChE activity from inhibition was slow and rate-determining (99 % recovery within 16 d), compared with a fast elimination of diazinon (99 % elimination within 17 ?h). The obtained model parameters were compared with toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic parameters of Gammarus pulex exposed to diazinon from previous work. This comparison revealed that G. pulex is less sensitive because of a six times faster detoxification of diazinon and diazoxon and an approximately 400 times lower rate for damage accrual. These differences overcompensate the two times faster activation of diazinon to diazoxon in G. pulex compared to D. magna. The present study substantiates theoretical considerations that mechanistically based effect models are helpful to explain sensitivity differences among different aquatic invertebrates. Environ.

40|$|Calcium-phosphate ceramic {{particulates}} {{are often}} used as filler material for enhanced repair of dental bone defects. Although evidence of bone ingrowth in the scaffold of these particles has been described, it is not observed consistently. Fibrous tissue often encapsulates these particles, which can subsequently become dispersed into the surrounding tissues or even exfoliated. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate bioactive glass granules (Biogran) as a filler for osseous lesions, and to compare them with two commercially available Hydroxylapatite (HA) granules. The particulates were implanted in the jaws of five beagle dogs, resected and evaluated after 1, 2, 3, 6 and 12 months of implantation. Histological analysis revealed an improvement in repair of all the lesions. A massive osteoconductive bone growth was seen near the walls of the bony cavities, but in greater amounts around the bioactive glass granules than around the HA materials. On top of this massive growth a trabecular bone growth was observed in the centre of the bony cavities. These trabeculae were associated with the glass particles, which exhibited osteophilic properties, while fibrous tissue separated the bone tissue from the HA particles. The centres of many of the particles are excavated, and are subsequently filled by newly formed bone tissue. This <b>internally</b> <b>formed</b> bone tissue is not necessarily connected to the surrounding bone tissue, and functions as a nucleation site for further bone repair. For the mesenchymal cells within the eroded glass particles this inner environment acts as a stimulus to differentiate into osteoblasts and to start their osteogenetic potential. This phenomenon was not observed around the HA materials. If the latter were surrounded by fibrous tissue, disintegration of the surface by giant cells was observed. status: publishe...|$|E

Their dynamic and multilayered constructions of Asian American identities – {{as a political}} coalition; as shared experiences of racialization and racism; as unspoken bonds of community and comfort; and as simultaneous identities [...] created space for the myriad ways of being Asian American. Their narratives demonstrated the ways that identities are constantly in flux {{and in the process}} of being constructed, and how their identities are involved in simultaneous paradoxical dialogues between the individual-collective and the personal-social. That is, their identities <b>internally</b> <b>formed</b> through personal experiences while impacted by social relationships and politics. It is a constant process of negotiation, choice, and comfort while still holding on to some core sense of self. Students’ self-conceptions were constantly changing – often depending on immediate context, assumptions, comfort level, relationships, and interactions [...] even when they had a strong sense of their identities. What it meant, collectively and individually, to be Asian American (or Chinese American and Filipina/o American) was a dynamic process of constant re/negotiation and re/definition. The results of this study can be used to better inform policies, practice, and pedagogies in higher education, as well as to contribute to current understandings of race and identity. This study provides new perspectives to understand Asian American students as agents in educational contexts to negotiate, confront, and resist stereotypes and racism in higher education. This study also adds to the existing literature on Asian American undergraduate experiences by offering an alternative framework for understanding racial identities, and by centering their experiences in their own voices. I use a critical approach and a holistic framework for understanding Asian American racial identity are necessary to better illuminate the implicit assumptions of identity and race; as well as a social justice lens and framework grounded in critical theory that works within the intersections power, identity, and race. I hope to reframe the experiences of Asian Americans as another community of color struggling for power, agency, and place...|$|E

40|$|Stockholm {{archipelago}} is {{a combination}} of coastal and young glaciated conditions on hard rock geology with almost no primary porosity and very limited secondary porosity. Therefore the aquifer is both of limited capacity and exposed to salinity problem. In this context importance of fractures and soil cover is magnified. Lineaments are representatives of fractures in remote sensing. Fracture mapping in study area proves close correspondence between orientation of fractures and nearly located lineaments. Especially in this type of terrain, lineaments normally occur together with many other interesting hydrogeological features such as topographic attributes, soil, and vegetation; however, still each of these factors has its own effect on the groundwater situation. Through employment of geostatistical analysis and a modified variant of the RV (Risk Variable) method, called the PV (Probability Value) method, different attributes are rated by importance. The results show, soil cover is the most influencing factor then rock type and distance from lineaments; other factors are classified after them. It is discovered that the center of lineaments {{may not be the most}} suitable site to extract water because of being clogged by fills. This is particularly the case for shear fractures in which clay can be <b>internally</b> <b>formed</b> due to friction. Based on the statistical results a model is made in GIS environment in order to create hydrogeological maps. Such maps, after validation, can be used for any other area with similar properties even with missing or very limited data from boreholes. These maps definitively are only probability maps projecting areas with higher and lower prospect of aquifer potential and cannot guarantee high capacity in every borehole drilled in designated areas due to high heterogeneity of fractured rock system. Analysis of chemical data from wells proves a correlation between fracture orientations and topography with salinization and groundwater flow. Groundwater flow in the surroundings seems to be essential for feeding the aquifer as most of the wells with increased salt content have also low capacities...|$|E
