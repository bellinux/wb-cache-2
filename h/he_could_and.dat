5|$|Following the war {{council of}} 20 June, Schuyler ordered St. Clair {{to hold out}} as long as <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> <b>and</b> to avoid having his avenues of retreat cut off. Schuyler took command of a reserve force of 700 at Albany, and Washington ordered four regiments {{to be held in}} {{readiness}} at Peekskill, further down the Hudson River.|$|E
5|$|The fallen Kabandha again {{asked for}} the names of his vanquishers. Lakshmana {{introduced}} himself and Rama and asked the demon who he was. Kabandha narrated his story to the brothers and declared that he recognized Rama by {{the very fact that}} Rama had severed his arms. Kabandha requested that Rama perform his cremation rites, offered him what information <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> <b>and</b> died.|$|E
5|$|Leake had {{not brought}} many {{supplies}} to Gibraltar but provided what <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> <b>and</b> loaned Hesse the fleet's skilled manpower, {{of which the}} confederate garrison was desperately short. A labour force of some 500 men was assembled from the ships' companies and was put to work repairing the fortifications, remounting guns dislodged by Spanish fire and hauling cannon up the Rock to increase the fire being directed onto the Spanish batteries. One of those involved, Captain Willis, played such a prominent role that the track he used was renamed (and is still known as) Willis' Road, and he also gave his name to Willis' Battery (now Princess Royal's Battery), Magazine and Guard.|$|E

60|$|Observe, then, {{the special}} {{character}} of Giotto among the great painters of Italy is his being a practical person. Whatever other men dreamed of, <b>he</b> did. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> work in mosaic; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> work in marble; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> paint; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> build; <b>and</b> all thoroughly: {{a man of}} supreme faculty, supreme common sense. Accordingly, he ranges himself at once among the disciples of the Apostle of Works, and {{spends most of his}} time in the same apostleship.|$|R
5|$|On August 12, General Walton Walker, {{in command}} of the Eighth Army, {{dispatched}} part of the 27th Infantry Regiment, 25th US Infantry Division, to attack north from the 25th Division's zone to drive off 4th North Korean Division troops moving into Yongsan. Simultaneously, Church assembled all the combat service support soldiers <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>and</b> formed them into a combat unit to block further penetration of North Korean forces, which were setting up roadblocks on the roads from Yongsan.|$|E
5|$|Philip {{returned}} to Thessaly {{the next summer}} (either 353 or 352 BC, depending on the chronology followed), having gathered a new army in Macedon. Philip formally requested that the Thessalians join him {{in the war against}} the Phocians; the Thessalians, even if underwhelmed by Philip's performance the previous year, realistically had little choice if they wanted to avoid being conquered by Onomarchus' army. Philip now mustered all the Thessalian opponents of Pherae that <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> <b>and</b> according to Diodorus, his final army numbered 20,000 infantry and 3000 cavalry.|$|E
5|$|For his part, Minh resented that he {{had been}} deposed by a younger officer whom he viewed as an unscrupulous upstart. Minh was also upset with the {{detention}} of his fellow generals and around 30 of his junior officers. The latter group was set free when Minh made this a condition for his serving as the figurehead chief of state. Khánh attempted to avoid the issue of substantiating the alleged neutralist plot for as long as <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> <b>and</b> then tried to revive it by claiming that French agents were attempting to assassinate him and to enforce neutralism. Khánh offered no evidence, only claiming that the French had paid a hitman US$1300 to kill him, before later inflating the supposed reward for his assassination. American intelligence officials in Vietnam privately said that they were not aware of any such threat.|$|E
60|$|But he was chiefly tormented {{in these}} days by the want of amusement. He had so spent his life {{hitherto}} {{that he did not}} know how to get through a day in which no excitement was provided for him. He never read. Thinking was altogether beyond him. And he had never done a day's work in his life. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> lie in bed. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> eat <b>and</b> drink. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> smoke <b>and</b> sit idle. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> play cards; <b>and</b> <b>could</b> amuse himself with women,--the lower the culture of the women, the better the amusement. Beyond these things the world had nothing for him. Therefore he again took himself to the pursuit of Ruby Ruggles.|$|R

5|$|The Senate-passed bill {{then was}} {{transmitted}} to the House of Representatives, and was referred to the Coinage Committee on February 20. It was brought forward on February 27, 1925. When the Speaker, Frederick H. Gillett, {{asked if there was}} objection to the consideration of the bill, Ohio's James T. Begg wanted to know if there was anyone present who could give him information about it, and if there was not, he would object. Kvale stated that <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> <b>and</b> when Begg inquired if Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon favored the bill, he assured the Ohioan that this was so. Kvale had the Senate-passed bill substituted for the one he had introduced, and it received the House's endorsement without objection or amendment. It was passed into law with the signature of President Calvin Coolidge on March 2, 1925.|$|E
5|$|The large {{diversity}} of the flora around Adams is even more apparent in the herbage and, including the tree and shrub species previously mentioned, totals at least 843 species. This is {{more than any other}} mountain in the Pacific Northwest. The first extensive list of flora from the area around Mount Adams was published in 1896 by William Suksdorf and Thomas Howell and listed 480 species. Suksdorf had taken it upon himself to catalogue as many species around Adams as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>and</b> the list was the result of his extraordinary collection efforts. This was the most complete list for over a century and has finally been updated by David Beik and Susan McDougall to the current 843 species with hundreds of additional species listed. Adams is home to many rare plants including tall bugbane, Suksdorf’s monkeyflower, northern microseris (Microceris borealis), Brewer’s potentilla (Potentilla breweri), and mountain blue-eyed grass. The plant diversity is most evident in the many meadows and wetlands on the flanks of Adams. The notable Bird Creek Meadows includes in its famous display, magenta paintbrush, arrowleaf ragwort, penstemons, lupines, monkeyflowers, mountain heathers, and many others. In wetlands, generally at lower elevations, one can find bog blueberry, highbush cranberry, sundew, purple cinquefoil, and flatleaf bladderwort, in addition to many sedges and rushes. Subalpine and alpine meadows and parklands, while not as prolific as the meadows and wetlands of lower elevations, have a beautiful display as well with partrigefoot, Cascade rockcress, subalpine buttercup, Sitka valerian, alpine false candytuft, elegant Jacob’s ladder, and various buckwheats as prominent players.|$|E

25|$|As Philippicus {{headed for}} the Capital Justinian was making his way to Armenia, a warzone between the Byzantines and Arabs. He reached as far as Nicomedia when {{attempting}} to turn back, he was caught at the twelfth mile stone of the Capital and executed on the spot. Philippicus had arrived before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>and</b> was greeted with open arms at the capital.|$|E
25|$|Stephenson was {{promoted}} to captain on 12 April 1937, and for the 1937 and 1938 cricket seasons his army duties precluded his playing a full season of cricket, but he continued to turn out for Essex when <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> <b>and</b> managed about 50 wickets in each season. In 1939 he played much more, and acted as captain {{on a number of}} occasions, one of three players so employed by Essex that year.|$|E

25|$|While touring Europe, Vishniac {{posed as}} a {{traveling}} fabric salesman, seeking aid where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>and</b> bribing anyone who {{got in his}} way. During his touring of Eastern Europe (1935–1939), he was often arrested by police for taking these pictures, sometimes because he {{was thought to be}} spying. Later, when published, these photographs made him popular enough for his work to be showcased as one-man shows at Columbia University, the Jewish Museum in New York, the International Center of Photography and other such institutions.|$|E
25|$|With his arm injured, Paige {{suddenly}} found himself unemployable. He looked for {{work as a}} manager or coach, but was unsuccessful. One ballclub owner {{was willing to give}} him a chance to play ball again—J.L. Wilkinson of the Monarchs. Wilkinson offered him the modest opportunity to play, not for the Negro American League Monarchs, but for a second-string barnstorming team called the Travelers, which was now renamed the Satchel Paige All-Stars. Paige would pitch when <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>and</b> play first base when he could not.|$|E
25|$|His parents left {{practically}} no estate {{and at the}} age of eighteen he found himself entirely dependent upon his own resources. He completed high school but because of increasing unemployment that preceded the 1930s depression he abandoned plans for university. However, he found what jobs <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>and</b> studied during the evenings. He worked through the subjects he would have taken at university by using material from the Pasadena Public Library. He became interested in chemistry and eventually specialized in the use of explosives finally settling on the new field of rocketry.|$|E

25|$|Brentford and Waller were {{excellent}} strategists of the 17th century type, {{and neither}} would fight a pitched battle without every chance in his favour. Eventually on 29 June, the Royalists {{were successful in}} a series of minor fights about Cropredy Bridge. The result was, in accordance with continental custom, admitted to be an important victory, though Waller's main army drew off unharmed. In the meantime, on 15 June, Essex had relieved Lyme Regis and occupied Weymouth, and was preparing to go farther. The two rebel armies were now indeed separate. Waller had been left to do as best <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> <b>and</b> a worse fate was soon to overtake the cautious earl.|$|E
25|$|From January 1997 until being {{sworn in}} as the 21st Secretary of Defense in January 2001, Rumsfeld served as Chairman of Gilead Sciences, Inc. Gilead Sciences is the {{developer}} of Tamiflu (Oseltamivir), which {{is used in the}} treatment of bird flu. As a result, Rumsfeld's holdings in the company grew significantly when avian flu became a subject of popular anxiety during his later term as Secretary of Defense. Following standard practice, Rumsfeld recused himself from any decisions involving Gilead, and he directed the Pentagon's General Counsel to issue instructions outlining what <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>and</b> could not be involved in if there were an avian flu pandemic and the Pentagon had to respond.|$|E
25|$|However, Khánh {{received}} little assistance from Minh, who resented his deposal by a younger officer whom he {{viewed as an}} unscrupulous upstart.
