5000|$|In {{the opening}} chapter, Davis {{discusses}} {{the factors that}} led Glasman to launch the Blue Labour initiative. The first was his mother, a lifelong Labour supporter who very much saw the Labour party as the champion of ordinary people's interests. Glasman was incensed that on the night she died, Labour's bailout of the banks was still playing out on the news. Glasman saw the bailout as a huge unnecessary transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich. It was {{on the night of}} her death in January 2009, in conversation with his wife, that Glasman first came up with the label [...] "Blue Labour". Another key influence in the development of Blue Labour was Phillip Blond, the so-called [...] "red Tory". When Blond first met Glasman it was the Tory who was much better known within Westminster. The two became friends and Blond was pleased to help raise Glasman's profile as the two had partially overlapping ideas. The success of Obama's 2008 election campaign had also helped to inspire Glasman, as it involved the sort of relationship-orientated, <b>decentralised</b> <b>community</b> mobilisation that he wished to promote. A fifth influence was Glasman's prior involvement with Citizens UK, an umbrella group dedicated to community organising.|$|E
40|$|Aboriginal {{education}} {{in remote areas}} of Australia {{continues to be a}} contested focus for policy and practice, with little debate that actively involves Aboriginal people themselves. This thesis attempts to redress this gap in a small way by in-depth conversations about education with Anangu in the tristate area of central Australia (the region where Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory meet). Here Aboriginal people live in relatively small, dispersed desert communities with close language and familial connections. Contact with Europeans is relatively recent, with provision of schooling moving from centralised mission-based schooling to <b>decentralised</b> <b>community</b> schools following the 1967 referendum. Anangu children are frequently positioned as deficient in mainstream educational achievement narratives within colonial and neo-colonial educational endeavours. This study seeks to inform Anangu education policy and practice from Anangu standpoints and to explore the potential for standpoint dialogue in negotiating alternatives in tristate education (Harding, 1992) ...|$|E

40|$|New Zealand’s Primary Health Care Strategy (PHCS) has a stated {{commitment}} to defined populations who suffer disproportionately from ill health. This thesis examines whether some prevailing discourses actually decrease {{the focus on}} health inequalities. Words and ideas shared by a group {{can be considered a}} discourse when the underpinning values serve a social and political function for that group. To examine whether discourse was constraining health care I considered the nursing and medical media pertaining to both the PHCS and the primary health care nursing framework and sought their dominant discourses. I found that the nursing and medical media focused on predominantly professional and industrial issues. These were expressed very differently with the medical media reacting to the ramifications of the PHCS especially Primary Health Organisations (PHOs), while the nursing media had a visioning quality, imagining how nursing could function in primary health care (PHC). The result was that, in the media studied, the upheaval of the PHCS left professionals mainly wondering about their own professional interests, rather than considering what those who suffer from health inequalities needed. The discourse of the PHCS may also serve political rather then altruistic purposes. I found historical examples of where discourse had underpinned health policy and I suggest that current (Ministry of Health) MOH discourse values <b>decentralised</b> <b>community</b> health decision making. The <b>decentralised</b> <b>community</b> health model of small community PHOs situates the responsibility for health locally. This health responsibility may gloss over factors in community health which are affected by Government policy such as employment policy, and thus should be dealt with centrally by legislation. These factors {{have been found to be}} the most pertinent in health inequalities. So while models of community partnerships may seem to place communities as agents in their own health, this downplays the determinants of health which are beyond their control. Moreover the multiple PHOs through the country, while costly in the repetition of bureaucracy, also make analysis of the PHCS difficult, since there is in effect multiple Primary Health Care Strategies being played out in each area, as interventions of various qualities are implemented. Having shown that discourse can decrease the focus on health inequalities due to other professional and political drivers. I then looked at health initiative concepts which are effective, efficient and equitable given the current set up of PHOs and nursing innovations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Contextual Integrity {{has been}} {{proposed}} to define privacy in an unusual way. Most approaches take into account a sensitivity level or a “privacy circle”: the information {{is said to be}} private or public and to be constrained to a given group of agents, e. g. “my friends”. In the oppo-site, Contextual Integrity states that any information transmission can trigger a privacy violation depending on the context of the transmission. We use this theory to describe a framework that one can use in an open and <b>decentralised</b> virtual <b>community</b> to handle privacy in a socially en-forced way. This paper describes a framework, in which we can formally describe privacy constraints, that are used to detect privacy violations according to the Contextual Integrity theory. This framework is part of an ongoing work aiming at applying social control to agents that handle the information, so that malicious agents are excluded from the system. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{globally}} expanding {{community of}} educators {{involved in the}} teaching of Chinese as a Foreign Language (CFL) is being pushed to adapt to diverse educational contexts, engendering tension and dislocation. There has been limited success in efforts to modernise practice {{in the teaching of}} Chinese, with subsequent urgent calls for both a fresh approach to innovation, and for {{a better understanding of the}} nature of teacher experience in the professional community. This article reports a project which employed self-study to investigate, through analysis of reflective narratives, two career trajectories associated with Chinese as a foreign language. Results: The analysis of the narratives uncover issues of identity and power, in the shaping of the participants’s practice and professional trajectories. The analysis provides illustration of how limitation in professional participation can result in limitation of innovative practice. The investigation identifies the formation of new independent <b>decentralised</b> professional <b>communities</b> for CFL.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} the new relationships established between the State, {{the market and}} civil society through the study of a municipal <b>decentralised</b> <b>community</b> nurseries programme implemented in poor neighbourhoods of Montevideo. A country with a strong centralist tradition, Uruguay {{has lived in the}} last decade a process of 'participative decentralisation' in its capital city, initiated by the left-wing coalition government of the Municipality of Montevideo. The different elements that might account for the effectiveness of this participative programme are analysed in this research. The decline of centralised State models, burgeoning decentralisation policies and the emergence of new actors and interests have dramatically altered the context of social policy in the last decade. Participation and empowerment have been top of the agenda of policy-makers and academics. This has stimulated the debate over democratisation and civil society, particularly in Latin America. Here, the State has had a traditionally strong embeddedness in society, and the debate over State reform has coupled with a marked economic crisis prompted in great part by the effects of the liberalisation and stabilisation policies enforced during the 1980 s. The findings of this research (obtained through observation, questionnaires and interviews) show that effective and democratic decentralisation policies require a redistribution of power through participative channels. Relying on the ideas of an 'economy of solidarity', this thesis argues that the boundaries of private, public and political domains of action are challenged by the creation and strengthening of social organisation. Findings point to the importance of enhancing links of mutual trust and solidarity to generate reciprocity and create stronger local organisations with a well developed internal management capacity. The claim is made that together with an 'endowment' of coherent and dependable public institutions, which allow power distribution and local self- development, this leads to synergistic relationships and effective negotiation within and between State and non State actors. The effectiveness of the Nuestros Ninos community nurseries programme seemed thus to depend mainly on its decentralised and participative design and on the trust and reciprocity links established within the community and with the municipal officers. However, it was found that better use could be made of its decentralised structure and that more efforts should be placed on strengthening the neighbour management associations of the nurseries as well as the relationships between these associations and the nursery staff...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} theory and {{practice}} of the voluntary principle in English Congregationalism between 1825 and 1862. The voluntary principle came to be seen in this period as of the essence of Congregationalism and its Congregationalist adherents sought to achieve its consistent practice in every aspect of denominational life. Chapter 1 describes the breakdown of the old 'catholic' consensus in British evangelicalism. By the mid- 1820 s the cooperation born of revival was being sorely tested on a number of fronts. Politics was certainly important, but there was also growing denominational self-interest. This was particularly the case in home and foreign missions and Congregationalists, perhaps the most 'catholic' of bodies, were under pressure from within and without to pursue a more partisan policy. Out of these practical concerns emerged, as chapter 2 points out, a more clearly articulated theory of voluntary churchmanship. Of course voluntarism had been a principle of Congregational Independency since the 17 th century, but some adjustment was needed to the new circumstances of the 19 th century. Congregationalist and other dissenting apologists honed and refined the principle and gave it a sharpness and comprehensiveness it had never had before. Even such a 'catholic' nonconformist as John Angel James saw the need to instruct his congregation in its Dissenting principles. He and many others provided the theoretical basis for the practical exercise of the voluntary principle. With chapters 3 and 4 I turn to the internal consolidation of the Congregational community. The Congregational Union (chapter 3) provided an agency for denominational activity and a focal point for an otherwise highly <b>decentralised</b> <b>community.</b> In our period the union was only moderately successful in realizing its objectives, but it provided a forum for discussion even if it showed the limitations of Congregational voluntarism. By the late 1850 s the union was seriously threatened by its too many commitments, local indifference and internal strife. Perhaps more successful was the Dissenting and denominational press (chapter 4) in consolidating the community. Congregationalists were active in both the wider assenting press as well as their own denominational press. The voluntary principle was seen to be of great importance in the areas of education and chapel building. It was in both these areas that Congregationalism was most seriously challenged by the Establishment and it was here that the voluntary principle was most evidently curtailed. The education battle (chapter 5) was a valiant one, but it was doomed from the start. The Congregationalist system simply could not sustain a viable alternative to the state-supported system. Chapel building (Chapter 6) was more successful, but its success was itself a recognition of the limited resources of the Congregational community and therefore of the voluntary principle...|$|E
40|$|Old fashioned, {{centralised}} {{and bureaucratic}} systems {{of natural resources}} management have been blamed for the failure to conserve forest resources. Such arrangements are alleged to result in top-down decision making processes, low levels of community participation, and lack of transparency. These criticisms have led to claims that the devolution of forest management to the community will improve resource management and more effectively deliver sustainable development. The devolution from the state to local communities of natural resource management access rights {{has been an important}} policy tool for forest management over the last several decades. This research examines to what extent, and how, decentralized forest governance delivers enhanced economic, social and environmental benefits. More specifically this study develops and tests a framework to assess how devolved forest governance performs across the indicators of participation, transparency, accountability, effectiveness, efficiency, and equity. A set of policy relevant and locally applicable governance indicators was developed through a participatory process that involved a large number of stakeholders including CFUG members and policy makers. To explore this topic, the study combines a single case study of devolved forest governance in Nepal with a medium-n research design of perceptions of community forestry operations in nine community forest user groups from three districts representing three different Nepalese ecological zones. A purposive sampling method was used to select CFUGs with different characteristics and CFUG members' opinions were collected using both qualitative and quantitative approaches. The study reveals that the key elements and indicators of governance are dialectically interconnected. Governance performance on one element and associated indicators shapes the outcome of other elements and indicators. Community forests located in the Middle Hills and High Mountains regions of Nepal generally perform well across the various governance indicators used, while a lower level of performance was observed in Terai region. However the research finds that ecological zone is not a determining factor of good governance; instead, socio-economic factors are found to shape the success of community forestry governance and outcomes. In addition, the research reveals that external agencies actually enhance community forest governance and outcomes as a result of synergy, interaction and cross-fertilization of knowledge between community forestry participants, government officials and other stakeholders. It is also the case that the better a community forest is governed, the more it flourishes and the wealthier it becomes. However, the distribution of the wealth and capital generated by a community forest remains a concern as the benefits are not being shared with the wider community. The research highlights the need to build the capacity of community forest users and, especially, to empower poor and disadvantaged people to ensure they obtain access to and are able to utilise the available resources. By developing an innovative framework to assess governance at local level, this study not only informs us about <b>decentralised</b> <b>community</b> forestry in Nepal, but the framework can also be utilised to assess community-based natural resource management initiatives in other developing countries...|$|E
40|$|Sustainability {{has strong}} {{implications}} {{on the practice}} of engineering. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is an appropriate methodology for assessing the sustainability of a wastewater treatment plant design. The present study used a LCA approach for comparing alternative wastewater treatment processes for small and <b>decentralised</b> rural <b>communities.</b> The assessment was focused on two energy-saving systems (constructed wetland and slow rate infiltration) and a conventional one (activated sludge process). The low environmental impact of the energy-saving wastewater treatment plants was demonstrated, the most relevant being the global warming indicator. Options for reduction of life cycle impacts were assessed including materials used in construction and operational lifetime of the systems. A 10 % extension of operation lifetime of constructed wetland and slow rate infiltration systems led to a 1 % decrease in CO 2 emissions, in both systems. The decrease in the abiotic depletion was 5 and 7 %, respectively. Also, replacing steel with HDPE in the activated sludge tank resulted in a 1 % reduction in CO 2 emission and 1 % in the abiotic depletion indicator.

Founded in 2005, {{it was the first of}} its kind to garner membership in the hundreds of thousands, was emblematic of user-led movements to improve the quality, efficiency and availability of digital media online, and was very publically shut down in 2007. Making critical use of Simondon’s notion of ‘individuation’, two interrelated techno-historical impulses are identified as central to the ‘in-formation’ of both BitTorrent and OiNK. Firstly, through research into the development of the global music industry’s ‘productive circuit’ of manufacturing, distribution, retail and radio, it is shown how consumers were gradually excluded from having a say in how, what and where they could consume. Secondly, a history of ‘OiNK-style’ filesharing is gleaned, not from P 2 P, but from research into small, <b>decentralised</b> ‘online’ <b>communities</b> that emerged throughout the 1980 ’s and 1990 ’s, where enthusiasts learned how to use software and hardware to manage the storage, reproduction, uploading and sharing of information. This thesis shows how BitTorrent exposed these previously exclusive practices to masses of consumers who were dissatisfied with both retail/broadcasting and public P 2 P, through the new possibility of private BitTorrent communities. Through a case study of OiNK, encompassing in-depth interviews with ex-members, screenshots and technical analysis, this thesis shows how OiNK gathered a large and diverse online cache of ‘archival grade’ recorded music, bringing old and deleted music back into circulation and amassing a core of fanatically committed members. It accounts for a nascent form of online community, where large member-bases manage every aspect of the reproduction and circulation of digital artefacts, and at higher levels of quality/efficiency than legal alternatives...|$|R

Abstract: With the {{promulgation}} of the South African Schools Act, {{public education}} in South Africa was <b>decentralised</b> and <b>communities</b> were made responsible for governance of their schools. White Paper 1 on Education and Training confirmed {{the inability of the}} state to meet financial requirements of public education. It placed a responsibility on school governing bodies to utilise all measures within their means to supplement schools’ resources, and emphasised the need {{to create a sense of}} community in and around schools to contribute to the success of their respective schools. School governing bodies often undertake extensive capital projects in the interest of the school, with funds raised through the school community, on property that belongs to the state. Despite the fact that school governing bodies are responsible to raise substantial funding, and remain accountable for all actions and outcomes pertaining to procurement, their discretional abilities in the appropriation of school funds and alienation of assets are limited by legislation, irrespective of the origin of the funds or assets in question. These restrictions have a substantial impact on the way that financing is structured and managed by public schools. Measures to centralise the power of decision-making and restrict autonomy of public schools are in stark contrast with international trends towards decentralisation of significant authority and responsibility to public schools. The constitutional space exists for schools to maintain a distinctive character, but requirements imposed upon schools by education authorities make it difficult to do so in practice. This is demonstrated through a series of litigation between the governing bodies of public schools and education authorities. Judgements of the South African Constitutional Court in the matter between The Federation of Governing Bodies for South African Schools v Member of the Executive Council for Education, Gauteng (2016) and in the case involving Rivonia Primary School (2013) contradict international reform measures to protect freedom and autonomy in education. Parents and communities carry the main [...] ...|$|R
40|$|There are {{increasing}} trends {{for government to}} engage communities and stakeholders {{in a variety of}} mechanisms as a part of service delivery, planning, and infrastructure and regional development. However, there is little empirical research to guide public managers in determining best value arrangements and strategic investments for building a region’s ‘collaborative advantage’. An economic appraisal of engagement processes might focus on evaluating whether the various benefits of engagement outweigh the costs. It is difficult to identify and assess many of costs and benefits associated with engagement processes. Many of the costs can be identified as transaction costs, where the costs of communication and engagement in a process can be likened to the search, negotiation, monitoring and enforcement costs familiar from market transactions. In a marginal analysis setting, {{the question is whether the}} costs occurred from an additional engagement process are justified when the benefits are considered. The benefits of engagement might include improvements to resource allocation and social capital, and reductions in conflict and resistance to change. These benefits are difficult to estimate, although non-market valuation techniques offer some insights into the magnitude of these benefits. In this paper, an approach to evaluate the benefits and costs of a <b>decentralised</b> form of <b>community</b> engagement using the Fitzroy Basin Association (FBA) regional natural resource management (NRM) body from Central Queensland, Australia is presented...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{feasibility}} of extracting and desalinating brackish groundwater in Egypt using solar driven high recovery rate reverse osmosis and membrane distillation desalination plants to help establishing <b>decentralised</b> agricultural <b>communities.</b> Groundwater properties and potential for sustainable development from seven main hydro-geological systems in Egypt were investigated. It was found that approximately 55 % of Egypt’s area has access to brackish groundwater, 47 % of which has access to aquifers with moderate to high potential for development. The feasibility of high recovery rate photovoltaic driven reverse osmosis desalination plants was investigated. Using commercial simulation tools, {{it was found that}} the plant can operate at recovery rates of 75 to 90 % with unit water costs of 0. 7 to 1. 65 USD/m 3 with the typical brackish groundwater composition and depths found in Egypt. Moreover, it was shown that such plants are cost competitive with similar plants driven by diesel generators if the subsidies on diesel are removed. The feasibility of replacing standard photovoltaic modules with photovoltaic/thermal collectors to reduce the energy consumption of the reverse osmosis plant by heating the water was explored. The annual performance of the photovoltaic/thermal collectors was analysed using TRNSYS. It was concluded that for such application, photovoltaic/thermal collectors have no economic advantage. The feasibility of using hybrid reverse osmosis/membrane distillation plants to increase the recovery rate was also investigated. A mathematical model was built using MATLAB to simulate the performance of a commercial full scale spiral wound permeate gap membrane distillation module. The model gave good agreement with experimental results available in the literature. A TRNSYS model was built to analyse the annual performance of the solar driven membrane distillation plant. It was found that the evaporation losses from the cooling tower greatly limited the recovery rate where no more than 10 % enhancement was feasible. Such small enhancement in the recovery rate resulted in a 1. 9 to 3. 6 fold increase in the unit water costs. It was concluded that higher recovery rates are possible with high recovery rate membrane distillation modules with low cooling requirements; and that solar driven hybrid plants can be economically feasible if: a source of waste heat from a renewable energy source is available to drive the membrane distillation process; the specific heat consumption of the process is reduced by 4 folds; and the module costs drop by at least 3. 5 folds...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 53 - 56). Due to past South African apartheid {{policies and}} new development trends, the spatial organisation of Cape Town is dispersed and <b>decentralised.</b> Many disadvantaged <b>communities,</b> including Khayelitsha, {{lie on the}} peripheral {{part of the city}} in the south east sector, distant from job opportunities. The rate of unemployment in these peripheral areas is high. One explanation suggested in the literature for the high unemployment rate in the peripheral areas of Cape Town is the Spatial Mismatch Theory. This theory argues that the spatial organisation of cities can drive unemployment because of the negative impact of the disconnection between places of work and places ofresidence (Rospabe and Selod, 2003). This thesis investigates whether or not the spatial mismatch theory is applicable to the cases of Khayelitsha and Du Noon in Cape Town. This research comparatively explores these case studies because of their similar skill set (unskilled), the high rate of unemployment, and the geographic location of each case relative to the job opportunities. This research adds to the literature by demonstrating under which conditions this spatial mismatch is more or less of a constraint. This thesis uses a qualitative research design using semi-structured, face-to-face interviews. A total of 18 respondents were interviewed, nine from each case site. The findings show that the spatial disconnection between Site C and job opportunities often resulted in long and costly commutes to work for many Site C residents, especially to the new developments. Du Noon residents did not experience a spatial mismatch when working in the northern suburbs. However, because Du Noon's transport system is undeveloped, it often made access to Cape Town's newly developed areas difficult...|$|R
40|$|The UK {{government}} has stated {{its commitment to}} renewable energy (RE) deployment, and waste reduction as part of national targets to tackle climate change. Anaerobic digestion(AD) has the potential contribute to green house gas emission reductions, improve energy security and provide <b>decentralised</b> renewable energy. <b>Community</b> renewable energy (CRE) has forged a new discourse in government policy, {{with a host of}} claimed benefits and relatively unexplored set of barriers. CRE research has explored the role of this development approach as a vehicle for further RE deployment, with studies predominately focusing on case study experiences with solar photovoltaic and wind technologies. However, contemporary academic and policy research has indicated a growing yet unknown interest in CRE adopting new technologies. Community Renewable Anaerobic Digestion (CRAD) has the potential help contribute to both waste and energy issues. Research to date has explored the large set of technological barriers that exist with AD. There is currently a gap in the literature regarding the potential of CRAD along with a greater understanding of the views of CRE groups. A cross sectorial analysis of CRE groups in the South West was adopted using an electronic survey and set of semi-structured interviews. The primary data discovered a diverse set of motivations influenced the groups’ decisions to develop RETs. Several overarching barriers however constrain the concept of CRAD. These can be broadly split into social capacity to develop the technology, along with specific issues of securing feedstock for the digesters. However, a host of options to overcome such barriers were identified from the research. Most notably, greater access to demonstration sites and feedstock material. This report suggests that at present the concept of CRAD is crucially constrained by the perceived risks outweighing potential gains to the CRE groups in the South West...|$|R
