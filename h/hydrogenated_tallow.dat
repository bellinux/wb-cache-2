A nonmodified Na+-montmorillonite and two montmorillonites surface-modified by dimethyl 2 -ethylhexyl (<b>hydrogenated</b> <b>tallow</b> alkyl) and methyl bis(2 -hydroxyethyl) (<b>hydrogenated</b> <b>tallow</b> alkyl) ammonium cations, respectively, were used. The evolution of molecular weights was followed {{in relation to}} silicate surface modification and clay concentration. The alcohol-bearing organo-modified clay was a co-initiator for the polymerization reaction and thus controlled the molecular weight of the PCL chains. Furthermore, the number-average molecular weight of the growing PCL chains linearly increased with the monomer conversion. Nanocomposites were analyzed by small-angle X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and thermogravimetry. The clay dispersion depended {{on the structure of}} the alkylammonium used to make the clay more hydrophobic. Exfoliated nanocomposites were formed when hydroxyl-containing alkylammonium. was used; otherwise, intercalated structures were reported. Thermogravimetric analyses showed a higher degradation temperature for the exfoliated structures than for the intercalated ones, both of them exceeding the degradation temperature of unfilled poly(epsilon-caprolactone).

Alkyl silanes and amines were applied to modify the kaolin surface in order to render the particles hydrophobic and dispersible in non-polar solvents. A Hammett indicator shows the surface of kaolin has strong acidic groups and the silanes, such as isobutyltrimethoxysilane (IBTMS), did not neutralise them, whereas the amines, such as <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>tallow</b> (HT) and a polyisobutyl chain based stabiliser (SAP), reacted with them.

40|$|International audiencePolyamide 6 nanocomposites {{based on}} {{sepiolite}} needle-like clay were prepared via melt extrusion. Sepiolite was organomodified with trimethyl <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>tallow</b> quaternary ammonium (3 MTH) by using different amounts of modifier {{respect to the}} sepiolite. The effect of modifier/sepiolite ratio on the final nanocomposite properties and the catalytic effect of the sepiolite on the polymeric matrix were evaluated. The presence of organomodified sepiolite on the polymer matrix favoured the crystallinity of the PA 6. The catalytic effect of the sepiolite was reduced as the modifier amount increased. The Elastic modulus and Heat Deflection Temperature (HDT) in PA 6 /organosepiolite nanocomposites increased ∼ 2. 5 times respect to the neat PA 6 matrix. The higher the modification grade the better the dispersion and orientation of needle-like sepiolite clay were attained. This effect supported the reinforcement efficiency of organosepiolites with high modifier content...|$|E

The spectral {{features of the}} most noteworthy bands are studied, and their correlations {{with the amount of}} fatty acids quantified by gas chromatography are presented. Principal component analysis is applied to classify the set of samples by their level of unsaturation [saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) ]. The most remarkable MUFA and PUFA oil sources are independently classified by applying stepwise linear discriminant analysis to the Raman shifts selected by their correlation with fatty acids or structural assignments. The results show that FT-Raman spectra not only have information of the degree of unsaturation but also of the balance among the amounts of SFA, MUFA, and PUFA. The scattering intensities near different Raman shies (3013, 1663, and 1264 cm(- 1)) show high correlations with the fatty acid profile determined by gas chromatography...|$|R
40|$|Nanocomposites from {{polyurethane}} (PU) and montmorillonite (MMT) {{were prepared}} under melt-mixing condition, by a twin screw extruder {{along with a}} compatibilizer to enhance dispersion of MMT. MMT {{used in this study}} was Cloisite 25 A (modified with dimethyl <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>tallow</b> 2 -ethylhexyl ammonium) or Cloisite 30 B (modified with methyl tallow bis- 2 -hydroxyethyl ammonium). Maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MAPP) was used as the compatibilizer. XRD and TEM analysis demonstrated that melt mixing by a twin-screw extruder was effective in dispersing MMT through the PU matrix. The PU/Cloisite 30 B composite exhibited better interlayer separation than the PU/Cloiste 25 A composite. Nanoparticle dispersion was the best at 1 wt % of MMT and improved with compatibilizer content for both composites. Properties of the composites such as complex viscosity and storage modulus were higher than that of a pure PU matrix and increased with the increase in MMT content, but decreased with the increase in compatibilizer content. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|In this study, layered silicate/aliphatic {{polyester}} nanohybrids were synthesized by ring-opening polymerization of c-caprolactone as {{promoted by}} the so-called coordination-insertion mechanism. These nanocomposites were formed in presence of montmorillortite surface-modified by ammonium cations bearing hydroxyl group(s), such as bis(2 -hydroxyethyl) methyl (<b>hydrogenated</b> <b>tallow</b> alkyl) ammonium. The lactone polymerization could in initiated by all the hydroxyl functions available at the clay surface, after activation into either tin(II) or AI(III) alkoxide active species. Hybrid nanocomposites were accordingly generated through the covalent grafting of every polyester chain onto the filler surface. Surface-grafted polycaprolactone (PCL) chains were untied and isolated by ionic exchange reaction with LiCl in THF solution and molar masses were measured by size exclusion chromatography. The PCL molar masses could be controlled and readily tuned by the content of hydroxyl groups available at the clay surface. Interestingly, initiation reaction by aluminum trialkoxide active species yielded grafted PCL chains characterized by very narrow molecular weight distribution (M-w/M(n) similar to 1. 2). These polyester-grafted layered silicate nanohybrids displayed complete exfoliation of silicate sheets as shown by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

40|$|Achieving {{complete}} exfoliation of clay {{in their}} polymer nanocomposite {{is a matter}} of interest as it can significantly affect the material properties. Herein, an efficient way of enhancing the interlayer spaces of organically modified clays (OC) containing two types of surfactants, benzyl methyl <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>tallow</b> (Cloisite 10 A) and dimethyl dihydrogenated tallow (Cloisite 20 A) while mixing with the styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) is reported. The prolonged swelling of the OC in toluene helped the rubber chains to disentangle in the interlayer spaces identifiable from the morphology and the change of the d-value. The small angle X-ray scattering traces for all the Cloisite 20 A/SBR composites indicated a very extensive dispersion of the OC and using the Guinier equation from SAXS, radius of gyration was calculated. An optimal size of 6 – 7 nm for the dispersed clay particles was found for maximizing resistance to abrasion as well as mechanical properties. Finally the enhanced tensile properties were correlated with the vulcanization behavior as well as the filler/polymer interfacial interaction from rheology through the completely exfoliated morphology observed for the swollen clay filled samples. Moreover an exclusive mechanism for curing of the composites was also derived...|$|E

40|$|Mixed catanionic {{surfactant}} systems {{based on}} amino acids were investigated {{with respect to}} the formation of liquid crystal dispersions and the stability of the dispersions. The surfactants used were arginine-N-lauroyl amide dihydrochloride (ALA) and Nα-lauroyl-arginine-methyl ester hydrochloride (LAM), which are arginine-based cationic surfactants; sodium <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>tallow</b> glutamate (HS), a glutamic-based anionic surfactant; and the anionic surfactants sodium octyl sulfate (SOS) and sodium cetyl sulfate (SCS). It is demonstrated that in certain ranges of composition there is a spontaneous formation of vesicular, cubic, and hexagonal structures. The solutions were characterized with respect to internal structure and size by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and turbidity measurements. Vesicles formed spontaneously and were found for all systems studied; their size distribution is presented for the systems ALA/SCS/W and ALA/SOS/W; they are all markedly polydisperse. The aging process for the system ALA/SOS/W was monitored both by turbidity and by cryo-TEM imaging; the size distribution profile for the system becomes narrower and the number average radius decreases with time. The presence of dispersed particles with internal cubic structure (cubosomes) and internal hexagonal structure (hexosomes) was documented for the systems containing ALA and HS. The particles formed spontaneously and remained stably dispersed in solution; no stabilizer was required. (Cubosome and hexosome are USPTO registered trademarks of Camurus AB, Sweden.)

40|$|Polymeric nanocomposites are novel {{materials}} of huge interest owing to their favourable cost/performance ratio with low amount of nanofillers, improved thermal resistance, flame retardancy and mechanical properties {{in relation to}} their matrices. In this work, composites based on post-industrial waste or primary recycled poly(butylene terephthalate) and 5 [*]wt. % of organic modified montmorillonite clays were melt compounded using a twin-screw extruder. A 2 (2) factorial experimental design was used to study the compounding and processing variables: Organic modified montmorillonite with one or two <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>tallow</b> (initial basal spacing) and screw speed of the extruder. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy suggest that a partial exfoliation of the organoclay in the recycled poly(butylene terephthalate) matrix was achieved for organic modified montmorillonite with lower initial basal spacing. On the other hand, formulations containing organic modified montmorillonite with higher initial basal spacing showed only intercalated structure. The recycled poly(butylene terephthalate) -organic modified montmorillonite nanocomposites did not drip flaming material during burning tests. Storage of dynamic-mechanical, tensile and flexural moduli of the recycled poly(butylene terephthalate) -organic modified montmorillonite were improved when compared with both virgin and recycled poly(butylene terephthalate) s, mainly for nanocomposites formulated at a lower initial basal spacing organoclay. This could be related to a better diffusion of polymer into organic modified montmorillonite layers compared with the higher initial basal spacing organoclay. The improvements on the physical properties of recycled poly(butylene terephthalate) showed the feasibility to add value to primary recycled engineering thermoplastics with a very small amount of organic modified montmorillonite...|$|E
40|$|Adhesive nanocomposites of {{organically}} modified montmorillonite (OM) and polyurethane {{have been}} synthesized and their permeability to oxygen and water vapor has been measured. The gas permeation through the composites was correlated to the volume {{fraction of the}} impermeable inorganic part of the OM. The incorporation of small volume fractions of the platelike nanoparticles in the polymer matrix decreased the gas transmission rate, when the interface between the two heterogeneous phases was properly designed. The oxygen transmission rate decayed asymptotically with increasing aluminosilicate volume fraction and a 30 % reduction was achieved at 3 vol %, when the clay was coated with bis(2 -hydroxyethyl) <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>tallow</b> ammonium or alkylbenzyldimethylammonium ions. In contrast, coating the clay surface with dimethyl dihydrogenated tallow ammonium ions leads {{to an increase in}} the gas transmission rate with augmenting inorganic fraction. This was attributed to a probable change in morphology resulting from phase separation at the interface between the apolar pure hydrocarbon clay coating and the relatively polar PU. The water vapor permeation through the PU nanocomposites was more strongly reduced than oxygen and a 50 % reduction was observed at 3 vol % silicate fraction. This was attributed to stronger interactions and hydrogen bonding of the water molecules with the PU matrix as well as to their clustering. Differences in the hydrophobicity of the clay coating influenced the water transmission rate. No spectroscopic evidence could be obtained for a reaction between the hydroxyl groups of the clay organic coating and the isocyanate groups of the prepolymer. A mixed morphology, that is, exfoliated layers and intercalated particles was observed in all composites. WAXRD and TEM gave a qualitative picture of the microstructure of the nanocomposites but no conclusive information. Some of the problems to be solved before a correlation between the nanocomposite properties and their microstructure can be established have been outlined...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present thesis was the synthesis, the characterization {{and the study of}} properties of novel epoxy - clay nanocomposites. For this purpose commercial inorganic montmorillonite clays (of the type Na+-PGW obtained from Nanocor Inc. and Na+-Cloisite obtained from Southern Clay Products) were used, as well as organically modified clays with primary and quartenary octadecyl- and <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>tallow</b> ammonium salts. In addition, proton-exchanged and organically modified (fully or partially) clays were produced from the parent sodium clay Na+-PGW. For the formation of protonated clays (H+-PGW) a weak dilution of HCl acid was used, while polyoxypropylene di/triamines (Jeffamines) of various molecular weights were used for the formation of organically modified clays. The organic modification of inorganic clays was either full (100 % of the ion-exchange sites of the parent clay) or partial (35, 50, 65 and 95 % of the ion-exchange sites of parent clay). The di/triamines were also protonated fully (100 % of the amine groups) or partially (0, 33 and 50 % of the amine groups). All the commercial and laboratory-prepared organoclays were characterized in order to obtain information about their structure, the possible conformation of alkylammonium ion within the clay gallery space, the actual percentage of organic modifier in the organoclays, the thermal stability and the morphology of the organoclay particles. The procedure of synthesis of epoxy-clay nanocomposites was then optimized (epoxy/amine ratio, temperature and time of curing, pot-life etc.) and pristine epoxy samples as well as epoxy - clay/organoclay nanocomposites were produced. The in situ polymerization method was used and the epoxy monomers were mixed with the clay via mechanical stirring or sonication. The nanocomposites produced were characterized for their structure and their mechanical, thermal and barrier properties, as well as their resistance to solvents. The results obtained provided valuable insight of the effect of the type, percentage and protonation of clay modifier to the structure and properties of glassy and rubbery epoxy - clay nanocomposites. The above parameters are critical for the expansion of gallery space {{as well as for the}} formation of the necessary organophilic environment for the insertion of epoxy monomers. The ion-exchange of Na+-PGW with fully or partially protonated amines was more effective for the insertion of alkylammonium ions than the ion-exchange of H+-PGW with protonated amines or the ion-exchange of Na+-PGW with neutral amines in aqueous solution. It should be noted here that the Na+-exchange with neutral amines in aqueous solution was unexpectedly high due to the protonation of amines from the weakly acidic terminal -OH at the external surfaces or defects sites of the Na+-clay crystals. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{plastics}} {{industry is}} increasingly oriented towards {{the use of}} polymers from natural origin (biobased) replacing plastics derived from petrol chemistry (fossil-based). Recently, some aliphatic polyamides were revalued by industries for packaging and for long-term applications but still low investigated. Moreover, nanoclays have been proven to improve mechanical and barrier performance of fossil based PAs. On the other hand, these superior properties of PA nanocomposites usually have as a "side effect" the increase of the brittleness by suppressing plastic deformation at the crack tip, which greatly limits the application of these materials. In this study two kinds of bio-polyamides were investigated: PA 10. 10 and PA 6. 10. As filler a natural montmorillonite modified with methyl <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>tallow</b> bis- 2 -hydroxyethyl quaternary ammonium (Cloisite® 30 B-Cl 30 B) was used. PAs were melt blended with clay using a co-rotating twin screw extruder LEISTRITZ ZSE 18 / 40 D. Neat polymers were also processed {{to have the same}} thermal history. Pellets obtained by the first extrusion were dried before the film extrusion. A single screw extruder (Eurotech Extrusion Machinery S. r. l.) (L= 80 cm D= 25 mm) equipped with a flat die was used. Samples for mechanical characterization were die cut and tested with a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min using a Zwick 10 universal testing machine. Specimens for EWF were prepared according to the ESIS protocol and conditioned at 33 % of R. H. and room temperature. Before testing, a fresh razor blade was carefully tapped into ligament of specimen to introduce two aligned sharp pre-cracks. The free ligament length (l) was left in the range from 5 to 22 mm. The specific work of fracture (wf) was obtained by dividing the integrated area of the load-elongation curve with the initial ligament area. The essential work of fracture (we) and the plastic term (β*wp) are easily obtained from the best linear regression of a set of values represented in a graph plotting wf versus l (Figure 1 a). An estimation of the shape and dimensions of the necked zone surrounding the fractured ligament was done in order to derive the wp value (Figure 1 b). Clay did not significantly affect the work required for the onset of crack propagation (we) in PA 6. 10 while decrease in PA 10. 10. The plastic work (β*wp) of both PA was increased with clay. The individual nanoparticles act as stress concentration points, which promoted cavitations and thus induced relatively large local deformation. By this way, the mechanical work content necessary to generate the plastic flow is increased, leading to a higher wp value...|$|E
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{microstructure}} of organoclays after organic surfactant modifications and the potential use in geoenvironmental engineering applications including waste containment in earthen barrier, rheological control agents for drilling fluid and soil stabilization. Organoclays, or clays modified by organic matters, are often synthesized by exchanging the naturally occurring interlayer inorganic cations (e. g., Na+, Ca 2 +) of the clay with organic cationic surfactants. In this research, montmorillonites intercalated with two quaternary ammonium surfactants, hexadecyltrimethylammonium (HDTMA+) and bis (<b>hydrogenated</b> <b>tallow</b> alkyl) dimethyl ammonium were used as the representative organo-rich, partitioning clays. The laboratory characterization techniques including XRD, TEM and FT-IR were employed to examine the interactions between montmorillonite minerals, surfactants, and organic sorbates. The results of XRD and TEM showed the successive interlayer expansion of montmorillonite because of intercalation of surfactants and hydrocarbons sorbates. The FT-IR results further confirmed {{the arrangement of the}} intercalated surfactant and the organic sorbates due to primary and secondary sorption. To understand the engineering behaviors of organoclays in earthen barriers, the free swelling and hydraulic conductivity tests were conducted to evaluate the permeability of compacted clay and geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) amended with HDTMA-organoclay. The results suggested that the addition of organoclay (less than 10 %) in compacted clay slightly increased the permeability of the mixture to water. However, due to the interaction between the organophilic phase in organoclays and non-polar liquids, low amounts of organoclay within the compacted clay admixture significantly decreased its permeability for non-polar liquids such as gasoline. Moreover, it was observed that low weight percentages of HDTMA-bentonite (up to 20 % by weight) had little or no impact on the hydraulic conductivity of the Na-bentonite or Ca-bentonite GCL. However, higher dosages of organoclay in GCLs could reduce the permeability to organic fluids such as gasoline. The impact of the amount of organoclay additives, pressure and temperature on the rheological behavior of organoclay/oil-based drilling fluids was investigated. The obtained results from XRD test suggested that the oil molecules entered the PM 199 interlayer, resulting in swelling and exfoliation of PM 199. It was observed that the viscosity of 5 % PM 199 suspension slightly decreased by increasing the temperature from 25 to 60 °C, and then the viscosity increased when the temperature raised from 60 to 150 °C. Moreover, {{it was found that the}} viscosity of 5 % PM 199 suspension increased when the pressure increased from 0 to 200 bar due to physical changes on both oil and organoclay particles. The effectiveness of organoclay and Portland cement for the solidification and stabilization (S/S) of contaminated soils was investigated in the laboratory. The results indicated that the addition of cement (5 % or 10 % by weight) reduced the hydraulic conductivity and increased the compressive strength of the solidification and stabilization soil specimens. Additionally, the leaching test results indicated that the addition of organoclay during solidification and stabilization significantly reduced the leaching of naphthalene and phenanthrene from the stabilized soil specimen. The results suggested that organoclay particles sorbed the organic contaminates and consequently reduced the naphthalene and phenanthrene leachate concentration. Also, it was observed that the naphthalene and phenanthrene leachate concentration decreased by increasing the curing time of S/S products. Overall, this study performed laboratory tests to obtain information regarding the microsturcture of cationic surfactant modifed bentonties and their engineering behaviors (e. g. hydrophobicity, swelling, permeability, stability in oil suspension). The obtained results are expected to yield significant insights into their potential applications as sorbents in hydraulic and sorptive barriers for organic compounds; rheological control additives in oil-based drilling fluid; agents for stabilization and solidification of contaminated soils...|$|E
