2500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} Catholic Emancipation in Ireland, a movement led by [...] Paul Cullen, Archbishop of Armagh and, later, Archbishop of Dublin (and later created a Cardinal), attempted {{to provide for the}} first time in Ireland higher-level education that was both accessible to Irish Catholics and taught by fellow-Catholics. In the 19th century, the question of <b>denominational</b> <b>education</b> in Ireland was a contentious one. It had divided Daniel O'Connell and the Young Ireland Movement for many years. The Catholic Hierarchy wanted to counteract the [...] "Godless Colleges" [...] established in Galway, Belfast and Cork and to provide a Catholic alternative to Trinity College, Dublin. Trinity was Anglican in its origins and, though Catholics had studied there since the 1780s, Trinity had maintained a religious test that excluded them from membership of the college's governing bodies (see Denis Caulfield Heron). In 1850 at the Synod of Thurles it was decided to open a Catholic University.|$|E

50|$|Despite this {{seemingly}} secular policy, anti-Catholic sentiment {{at the time}} resulted in hostility to Newfoundland's Roman Catholic population (which numbered half the colony) and to Catholic schools. This led to the Protestant-backed Education Act of 1843, which saw Catholics share education grants equally with Protestants. The Protestant grant was further divided between the Church of England and the Methodists and in the Education Act of 1876, the government transferred all its responsibility on education to the churches, thus setting up a <b>denominational</b> system of <b>education.</b> From this point on, religion, {{as well as the}} largest economic sector, fisheries, would be the driving factors behind Newfoundland's education system.|$|R

Recently the question of moral education and the educational concept in the state school has come to the fore, and with this also the question of universal or particular values. In the continuation we analyse how the prevailing permissive paradigm influenced the very concept and implementation of the subject of Ethics and Society in the 1990 s, and {{from the end of the}} previous decade onwards – after the implementation of curricular reforms – how it has influenced the subject of Citizenship Educational and Ethics.

Recovery was made, but by 1949, when the Dominion became a Province, it was {{in much the same}} condition as 25 years before. Facilities were still outdated and the terms of Confederation ensured that schools would remain run by <b>denominational</b> Boards of <b>Education.</b> On a positive note, the National Convention (1946-1948) endorsed the idea to build a degree granting institution in Newfoundland. As a result, MUC became the Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN) in 1949. and new money from the federal government began to arrive after 1957 in the form of equalization payments. The Newton Report (1952) and the Harris Report (1967) recommended limited government involvement over MUN and thus allowed it a certain level of autonomy.|$|R

Zinga then examines how Ontario has dealt with the issue of <b>denominational</b> rights in <b>education</b> and looks at what other challenges Ontario faces given the change of Canadian society since confederation. Through these areas of focus the issue is examined both from a historical perspective and as a current political issue with particular focus on the influence of the issue during the 2007 election. Concludes with the idea that {{it is up to the}} province going forward and any changes to the educational system will depend on how Ontario chooses to address this issue.|$|R

60|$|Such was {{the case}} with which Mr. Gladstone was called upon to grapple, and a {{delicate}} if not even a desperate case it was. The prelates knew what they wished, though they lay in shadow. What they wanted a protestant parliament, with its grip upon the purse, was determined that they should not have. The same conclusion as came to many liberals by prejudice, was reached by the academic school on principle. On principle they held <b>denominational</b> endowment of <b>education</b> to be retrograde and obscurantist. Then there was the discouraging consideration of which Lord Halifax reminded Mr. Gladstone. “You say with truth,” he observed when the situation had developed, “that the liberal party are behaving very ill, and so they are. But liberal majorities when large are apt to run riot. No men could have stronger claims on the allegiance of their party than Lord Grey and Lord Althorp after carrying the Reform bill. Nevertheless, the large majority after the election of 1832-3 was continually putting the government into difficulty.” So it befell now, and now as then the difficulty was Irish.|$|R
50|$|As his diocese also {{included}} the Bermudas, Feild bought a church ship and travelled a great deal, describing his journeys {{in a journal}} published in The Church in the Colonies. This, together with numerous publications, kept his doings {{in the public eye}} in England. He set up a boys' school, the precursor of Bishop Feild College of which so many influential Newfoundlanders were alumni, and a girls' school, as he was a firm believer in the education of women. He campaigned for thirty years for the grant given for education by the local legislature to Protestants to be divided so that Anglicans could be treated {{in the same way as}} the Roman Catholic Church. Nowhere else in the British colonies was a bishop to obtain such a <b>denominational</b> system of <b>education.</b> Although Feild disapproved of clergymen being politicians, he spoke out in defence of the Newfoundland fisheries, and in 1861 denounced the Newfoundland government. In 1867 he reorganised his diocese, acquired an assistant bishop, James Butler Knill Kelly (afterwards Primus of Scotland), and married Sophia, the widow of the Revd J.G.

40|$|Quest {{religious}} orientation among church leaders signifies {{a style of}} leadership committed to religious explorations more than to religious certainties. This study sets out to explore {{the extent to which}} quest {{religious orientation}} among religious leaders is a function of psychological predisposition (conceptualized in terms of psychological type theory) or a function of distinctive forms of religious experience (conceptualized in terms of Happold’s model of mysticism) among a sample of 1, 265 church leaders who participated in the 2011 Australian National Church Life Survey. The data demonstrated that higher levels of mystical orientation were associated with psychological predisposition, involving extraversion, intuition, feeling and perceiving. After controlling for sex, age, <b>education,</b> <b>denominational</b> groups and psychological type, higher levels of mystical orientation were also associated with higher levels of quest religious orientation. Mystical orientation partly mediated the effect of intuition on question orientation, but psychological preferences (for intuition and for perceiving) and mystical orientation seemed independently to promote quest religious orientation. Thus, church leaders committed to religious explorations rather than to religious certainties seemed to have been shaped both by psychological predisposition and by distinctive forms of religious experience...|$|R
