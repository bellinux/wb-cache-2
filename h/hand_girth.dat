40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present anthropometric {{measurements}} on 42 premature infants nursed in the neonatal intensive care unit of Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong. Design/methodology/approach – Birth information, including maturity, age, gender, birth weight and present weight, were recorded. About 13 body size measurements, including stature, <b>hand</b> <b>girth,</b> armscye girth, chest girth, arm length, max girth, abdomen girth, hand length, thigh girth, shoulder width, head to nape length, inside leg to heel length and foot length, were measured for each infant. Using these data, the body size distribution, the correlation between each body size measurement, and linear regressions of present weight and stature with other body size measurement were analyzed. Findings – It was found that present weight and stature of premature infants were the most desirable and significant size parameters for the development of a measurement chart for premature infants. Originality/value – The paper provides anthropometric measurement details of premature infants. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E
40|$|Starting from mid 2004, European clothes vendors will {{switch to}} a new {{standard}} system for designating the size of garments. This new system is defined in EN 13402 and based on body dimensions measured in centimeters. EN 13402 - 1 defines a standard list of body dimensions, namely head girth, neck girth, chest girth, bust girth, underbust girth, waist girth, hip girth, height, inside leg length, arm length, <b>hand</b> <b>girth,</b> foot length, and body mass. For each type of garment, the EN 13402 - 2 standard specifies a primary dimension, a body measurement in centimeters (or body mass in kilograms) that shall be used in designating its size. For some types of garment, where a single size is not adequate to select the right product, a secondary dimension is added. For use on language-neutral clothes labels, EN 13402 - 1 specifies a pictogram for each body dimension. The BodyDim MetaPost package helps TEX users in the simple generation of these pictograms as Embedded PostScript files. An example pictogram generated by BodyDim i...|$|E

With fierce suddenness he flung his sombrero down. He leaped at his black horse and dragged him to where his saddle lay. With one pitch he tossed the saddle upon the horse's back. His strong <b>hands</b> flashed at <b>girths</b> and straps. Every action was swift, decisive, fierce. Bounding for his bridle, which hung over a bush, he ran against a cowboy who awkwardly tried to avoid the onslaught.|$|R
40|$|Background: Hand-grip {{strength}} {{studies with}} healthy adults have shown correlation between anthropometric variables and hand grip strength. There is dearth in literature in population of Saudi Arabia. The {{objective of this}} study is to describe normative data to evaluate the relationship between handgrip strength and other anthropometric variables especially hand length, forearm circumference with regard to dominant hand, among healthy males in Abha, Saudi Arabia, using a Hand held dynamometer. Methods: A sample of 99 male adults from the population of Abha, Saudi Arabia, ages 20 to 72 years were tested using standardized positioning and instructions. A Hand–held dynamometer was used to measure grip strength in kilograms. Results: Low to medium correlation (significant) is found between all the variables and HGS. Age is negatively correlated. A stepwise regression predicts that hand length, age, forearm girth circumference are the three significant variables of hand grip strength. An ANOVA proves that hand grip strength is less for subjects above 60 years; hand grip strength is higher for subjects with extra-large forearm girth circumference. Conclusion: Normative values hand grip strength in population of Saudi Arabia is established through this study. The hand grip strength is influenced by hand length, <b>hand</b> <b>girth</b> circumference as well as age category of the subjects and these variables can be better predictors while clinically rehabilitating hand patients...|$|E
40|$|O trabalho foi desenvolvido na região Norte de Minas Gerais, em uma área pertencente a EPAMIG - CTNM, localizada no Perímetro Irrigado do Jaíba. O delineamento {{experimental}} utilizado foi inteiramente casualizado, com dois tratamentos e 22 repetições, e cada parcela constituída por três plantas. Objetivou-se avaliar o efeito da retirada da inflorescência masculina na precocidade de colheita e produção da bananeira-'Prata-Anã', avaliando-se os três primeiros ciclos. Houve redução no período entre a retirada da inflorescência e a colheita, quando se eliminou a inflorescência masculina, sendo que, no primeiro ciclo, promoveu aumento no peso total de frutos, peso médio de frutos, peso médio de pencas, diâmetro e peso do fruto central e espessura de casca do fruto central da segunda penca, peso da penca 2, peso da penúltima penca, peso do engaço e peso e comprimento da ráquis. Não promoveu aumento de peso total do cacho, no comprimento do fruto central da segunda penca, peso da penca 1 e peso da última penca. No segundo ciclo, apesar de tendência de aumento, não houve diferença estatística para os parâmetros de produção. Já no terceiro ciclo, houve aumento no peso do cacho, além de aumento nos parâmetros de produção, concordando com os resultados obtidos na primeira colheita ABSTRACT: This {{work was}} carried out in the EPAMIG/CTNM´s Experimental Farm, which is located in the irrigated area of Jaiba county in the north of Minas Gerais state, Brazil. The experimental design was completely randomized with two treatments and 22 replicants and each plot had three plants. The aim of this work was to evaluate the influence of male flowerage pruning on the bunch crop of irrigated banana 'Prata Ana' in the three first crops. The male flowerage pruning made the harvest time shorter and in the first crop the characteristics as total fruit weight; mean fruit weight, second fruit of the second <b>hand</b> <b>girth</b> and weight; second hand weight; hand before the last hand weight; peduncle´s weight and length was bigger than in the non-flowerage pruned banana tree plants. There was no response of pruning for the total bunch weight, first hand and last hand weight, and length of the central fruit of the second hand. In the second crop there was no response for the crop characteristics. In the third crop there was improvement of crop's characteristics as in the first crop...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{morphological}} characteristics and physical strength of the Malaysian cricket batsmen. Methods: Twenty four top order batsmen from the Malaysian senior, under- 19 s and under- 16 s cricket team were recruited for the study. Twenty six anthropometric, four somatotype and two physical strength variables were measured from all participants. Stature were measured by using stadiometer, calipers for skin-fold, non-stretch tape for girth, sliding caliper for segmental lengths and circumferences (breadths) and dynamometers for hand grip and back strength. Cater and heath (1990) equation was used to find the somatotype variables of height-weight ratio, endomorph, mesomorph and ectomorph. One way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyses significant between group differences in the variables. Results: The senior batsmen were significantly higher than under- 19 s and under- 16 s in body mass, relax and flex arm girths, forearm girth, chest girth, waist girth, calf girth, bi-acromial breadth, transvers breadth and hand grip strength. Both senior and under- 19 s batsmen were significantly higher than under- 16 s batsmen in arm span, total arm length, humerus and femur breadths. The under- 16 s batsmen were also significantly lesser than senior in hip <b>girths,</b> <b>hand</b> lengths and bi-ilocrist breadth, and from under- 19 s in sitting height and total leg length. Conclusion: Senior batsmen were significantly higher in the anthropometric measurement of girths, breadth and lengths than U- 16 because of 10 years age difference. Future research is essential to confirm the relationship between the anthropometric characteristics of batsmen with the batting technique and performance...|$|R
