5|$|The 1947 {{season was}} another strong one for Speedie. In {{a game against}} the Buffalo Bills, he tied a {{professional}} football record by catching a throw from Graham and running 99 yards for a touchdown. He finished the season as the league leader in receptions and receiving yards as the Browns won another championship. His 67 catches and 1,146 receiving yards, in fact, were the second-best in pro football history after Don Hutson of the Green Bay Packers, who caught for 1,211 yards in 1940. Speedie was named by news outlets as a first-team All-Pro. Speedie's success in 1947 came as he, Graham and Lavelli <b>gelled</b> as a passing and receiving unit, having studied hours of tape and worked on their technique and coordination. Speedie studied how defensive backs moved their feet and tried to break into the open by exploiting mis-steps. They experimented with screen passes and made modifications to common receiving routes to exploit the weaknesses of defenses.|$|E

In one sequence, Carl Grimes sparks up a {{cigarette}} lighter and drops {{it onto a}} horde of walkers after Rick creates a diversion to distract the walkers. Greg Nicotero, the special effect director for The Walking Dead, used black panels to capture {{the elements of the}} fire; this enabled them to edit the flames onto the walkers. To reduce the chances of getting burned, the stuntmen put on several layers of flame retardant suits. The first layer consisted of a dry Nomex undergarment; this was followed by several layers of Nomex clothing that were <b>gelled.</b> Since the sequence was conducted on multiple occasions, the stuntmen were coated with gel containing cationic polymers. The last layer was a raincoat, which would separate the gel from the stuntmen's clothing and allowed them to be engulfed in flames for several seconds without injury.|$|E

40|$|Key words: polymer <b>gels,</b> {{particle}} <b>gels,</b> emulsion, large deformation, friction, sensory   This thesis reports {{studies on}} the large deformation and lubrication properties of emulsion-filled <b>gels</b> and the way these properties {{are related to the}} sensory perception of the <b>gels.</b> The design of the studies included polymer and particle <b>gels</b> containing oil droplets of which the interaction with the <b>gel</b> matrix was varied, resulting in droplets either bound or unbound to the matrix. The unique combination of <b>gel</b> matrices and droplet-matrix interactions allowed to obtain a representative overview of the effect of the oil droplets on the properties studied. The molecular properties of the <b>gel</b> matrices determined the way the large deformation properties of the <b>gels</b> depended on the deformation speed. Polymer <b>gels</b> showed a predominantly elastic behaviour. Particle <b>gels</b> showed a more viscoelastic behavior. The effect of the oil content on the Young’s modulus of the <b>gels</b> was modulated by the droplet-matrix interactions, in agreement with existing theories. Bound droplets increased the Young’s modulus of the filled <b>gels,</b> whereas unbound droplets decreased it. Oil droplets embedded in the <b>gel</b> matrix acted as stress concentration nuclei. They also increased energy dissipation due to friction between structural elements of the <b>gel</b> (oil droplets and <b>gel</b> matrix). Stress concentration resulted in a decrease of the fracture strain for all <b>gels</b> and in a decrease of the fracture stress for polymer <b>gels.</b> For <b>gels</b> with non-aggregated bound droplets, a reduction in oil droplet size had the same effect on their rheological properties as an increase in oil volume fraction. The lubrication properties of the <b>gels</b> strongly depended on both the molecular and functional properties of the <b>gel</b> matrix and the oil content. For each type of <b>gel</b> matrix, the lubrication behaviour was affected by the ‘apparent viscosity’ of the broken <b>gels,</b> which in turn depended on the droplet-matrix interactions. The sensory perception of emulsion-filled <b>gels</b> appeared to be dominated by the properties of the <b>gel</b> matrix and by the oil content. Polymer <b>gels</b> were perceived as more melting, whereas particle <b>gels</b> were perceived as more rough. With increasing oil content both types of <b>gels</b> became more creamy and spreadable. The increase in spreadability and part of the increase in creaminess could be explained with the effect of the oil droplets on the breakdown properties of the <b>gels.</b> Since for all <b>gels</b> the scores for creaminess increased with increasing oil content, the release of oil droplets during oral processing could not completely explain the perception of oil-related sensory attributes. It is therefore concluded that the perception of these attributes is mediated by the lubrication properties of the broken <b>gel.</b> The large deformation and lubrication behaviour of the <b>gels</b> were the most important parameters related to sensory perception. Both parameters were affected by the droplet-matrix interaction. As a matter of fact, the droplet-matrix interaction affected the fracture behaviour of the filled <b>gels,</b> which was related to their spreadability, and the ‘apparent viscosity’ of the broken <b>gels,</b> which controlled the lubrication properties of these systems...|$|R
