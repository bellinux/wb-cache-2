40|$|<b>Emepronium</b> <b>bromide,</b> a drug used {{to control}} urinary frequency, has been {{reported}} as causing oesophageal ulceration but not stricture formation. This paper presents 3 {{cases in which the}} use of <b>emepronium</b> <b>bromide</b> preceded development of an oesophageal stricture and suggests that the drug played a causative role...|$|E
40|$|A {{double-blind}} cross-over {{trial of}} <b>emepronium</b> <b>bromide</b> (Cetiprin) in nocturnal frequency of micturition {{in a group}} of elderly women living in their homes showed that the drug was superior to placebo in diminishing urinary frequency, though not every person benefited. It is suggested that the drug may alter the established habit of rising at night to pass urine. Side-effects were negligible...|$|E
40|$|Drug {{histories}} {{were obtained}} from 76 patients {{at the time of}} initial Eder-Puestow dilatation for benign oesophageal stricture. Six patients had consumed drugs known to cause oesophageal ulceration (<b>emepronium</b> <b>bromide</b> and potassium preparations). Of the remaining 70 patients, 22 had regularly taken a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug before the onset of dysphagia compared with 10 patients in a control group matched for age and sex; this difference was significant (p less than 0. 02). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may have a causative role in the formation of oesophageal stricture in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux, in whom they should be prescribed with caution...|$|E
40|$|This article {{provides}} {{a review of}} the use of tlavoxate hydrochloride in the treatment of urge incontinence. It outlines the pharmacology, mode of action, toxicology and pharmacokinetic studies which have been carried out, and then reviews the clinical studies, including tbose involving patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy. The effects of dosages of 600 - 1200 mg/day are compared, particularly regarding safety and tolerability factors. Finally, alternative therapies to tlavoxate hydrochloride (a-adrenergic receptor blockers, oxybutinin chloride, terodiline hydrochloride, <b>emepronium</b> <b>bromide</b> and imipramine) are summarized. The article is written in the knowledge of recent evidence which indicates that tlavoxate hydrochloride exhibits only weak anticholinergic activity on receptors involved in the control of the lower urinary tract.
