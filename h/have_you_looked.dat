6000|$|Evans. I pray you now, good Master Slender's serving-man, and [...] friend Simple by your name, {{which way}} <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> for Master [...] Caius? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's a bad kitten, Cousin Tabitha; {{he made a}} cat's {{cradle of}} my best bonnet last time I came to tea. Where <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> for him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{afraid you}} don't come in," [...] Wrayson answered; [...] "but {{remember}} I am only following out a surmise. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> through your brother's papers carefully?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, well!" [...] he said, as if {{the matter}} were not important, and went on: [...] "I might <b>have</b> got <b>you</b> a post <b>had</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> me up. What boat are you on board?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Wix, however, {{instantly}} cut it off. [...] "I wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> in {{the salon}} for all the world!" [...] Then she explained a little: [...] "The salon isn't ours now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said she, [...] "and {{cane and}} umbrella, if you like, and pocket-handkerchiefs, too. I will fit you out completely, and shall {{be glad to}} <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>looking</b> like a decent man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O, a great deal; but I {{forget it}} is Sunday. We {{ought to be}} {{thinking}} of other things. Boys, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> over your Sunday school lesson?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{no other}} house quite like it in England," [...] she said. [...] "I suppose {{it is really a}} {{wonderful}} place. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> at the pictures?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{the tickets}} were {{disposed}} of in three hours," [...] Lord Loring answered. [...] "Everybody (the librarians tell me) {{is eager to}} see the pictures. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> in yet?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... “He {{was a real}} {{high-quality}} player. He {{probably never}} got the billing over here he should <b>have.</b> <b>You</b> <b>look</b> back on his hockey career {{on both sides of}} the pond and he had quite a resume.” - Tiger Williams ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, then, I would <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> to yourself, young master. There are sharp laws in France against {{refractory}} pupils--LETTRES DE CACHET {{are easily}} come by when such men {{as we are}} concerned with interest themselves in the matter.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Go {{back and}} make {{yourself}} {{look like a}} duchess, mamma," [...] she said, turning suddenly as she was going down-stairs. [...] "Put your point-lace over your head. I must <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> like a duchess. You must not take things humbly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Handed {{him over}} to the police," [...] the young man answered; [...] "but I am afraid they would never get him to the station. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> out of the window?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{have you}} been about," [...] he asked, [...] "since we had that talk in the Gardens to-day? <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> at your empty purse, and are you wise enough to take my way of filling it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> at, Moon, [...] In your time, [...] Now {{long past}} your prime?" [...] "O, I have looked at, often looked at [...] Sweet, sublime, Sore things, shudderful, night and noon [...] In my time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No more I ought," [...] said she: [...] "Mr. St. John {{tells me}} so too; and I see I wor wrang--but I've clear a {{different}} notion on you now to what I <b>had.</b> <b>You</b> <b>look</b> a raight down dacent little crater." ...|$|R
6000|$|Countess. Yet I would <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>look,</b> {{and look}} again, [...] Before you lay aside your arms, young friend! [...] A gentle bride, as she is, {{is well worth}} it, [...] That you should woo and win her with the sword. [...] 170 ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She? Oh, she is well enough," [...] replies the House. [...] "She lives close here. <b>You</b> must <b>have</b> {{passed the}} shop. <b>You</b> might <b>have</b> seen her <b>had</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> in. She weighs {{fourteen}} stone, about; and has nine children living. She {{would be pleased}} to see you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Her father, out of {{much thought}} {{and a solid}} ignorance about all of {{motoring}} beyond the hiring of chauffeurs and the payment of bills, suggested, [...] "Uh, dolly, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> to see if these, uh---- Is the carburetor all right?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} the forces you are up against? <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> into the unfathomable heart of this trouble? Understood the tug of the towns, the call of money to money; grasped the {{destructive}} restlessness of modern life; the abysmal selfishness of people when you threaten their interests; the age-long apathy of those you want to help? Have you grasped all these?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Countess," [...] he said, [...] "I {{know not}} {{wherefore}} I hesitate, {{being in a}} plight so desperate, and having so little choice of friends. But <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> into your own heart? Can you perform this office with the truth--the earnestness--time--zeal, even to tears, and agony of spirit--wherewith the holy gift of human life should be pleaded for? Woe be unto you, should you undertake this task, and deal towards me otherwise than with utmost faith! For your own soul's sake, and as you would have peace at your death-hour, consider well in what spirit you receive this ring!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know of that affair," [...] {{said the}} Stranger, [...] "and I have already placed in your museum-building the {{collection}} which I have obtained. If your Majesty pleases, I shall {{be glad to}} <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> at it. It may, in some degree, compensate for that which has been stolen." ...|$|R
3000|$|... “Innovation {{policy is}} a team sport {{and in order to}} get better {{innovation}} outcomes, you need to link the various players in the ecosystem effectively. That means <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to <b>look</b> at conductivity, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to <b>look</b> at communication, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to <b>look</b> at partnership collaboration and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to ceaselessly promote it.” [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "Draw the wood, smoke the pipe, {{court the}} ladies.--But wouldn't {{you like to}} see the inside of one of our poor cottages? I shall be very proud to <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> at mine, and to <b>have</b> <b>you</b> drink a glass of milk from my cows. I am sorry that I cannot offer you brandy, but there's none to be bought in the place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No wonder," [...] said Miss Winter, [...] "for Flora and Mary tell me {{she hardly}} spends five minutes over it in the morning, and with a book before her the whole time. If I send her up to make it fit to be seen, I meet with looks of annoyance. She leaves her books {{in all parts of}} the school-room for Mary to put away, and her table drawer is one mass of confusion. Her lessons she does well enough, I own, though what I should call much too fast; but <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> at her work lately?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The prettiest baste in the woods," [...] {{returned}} Pat promptly. [...] "He has black {{legs and}} underparts, black tail with white tip, and gray head and {{body with a}} dark cross on the shoulders. But he's just a sport of the red fox, a variation in between the red and black. A perfect specimen is worth a lot of money, but nowhere near what a black will bring. Between the red and all black {{there are a lot}} of variations of the cross, and the price varies accordingly. But let's get back to regular fur instead of freaks. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> over that price list I brought in, Alec?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now listen, Woodden. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> at that Odontoglossum Pavo, and if so, what do {{you think}} of it?" [...] and he nodded towards a plant which stood in the centre of the little group that was placed on the small table beneath the auctioneer's desk. It bore a spray of the most lovely white flowers. On the top petal (if it is a petal), and also on the lip of each of these rounded flowers was a blotch or spot of which the general effect was similar to the {{iridescent}} eye on the tail feathers of a peacock, whence, I suppose, the flower was named [...] "Pavo," [...] or Peacock.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{something}} of my own, that I'd like to <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> at. Of course, you won't {{get away with}} the Manet, alone; I don't suppose you expected that. I've an idea {{you can tell me}} where I've gone wrong, if I have; it's all a great while ago. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> ever been at the County Fair at Pymantoning since----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{one thing}} I should like to ask: If <b>you</b> <b>had</b> cared for me, would <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been {{offended}} at my <b>having</b> thought <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> differently?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All {{that you}} say is, in a measure, true," [...] {{he said in a}} low tone; [...] "yet do not send me away from you! Some day you may see things differently; some day trouble may come to you, and I may be your helper! There is only one thing: I would <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> upon me as a brother, and I would <b>have</b> <b>you</b> give me a brother's confidence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{asked the}} king {{to give me}} the command of half the men-at-arms and archers, and that I would march them through the city across London Bridge, close the gates there, and defend them alike against the rabble on the farther side and that of the city until help could be gathered. The king himself was willing that this should be so, but the council said that were I to do this, the gatherings from Essex, Hertford, Suffolk, and Cambridge would march hither and be joined by the rabble of the city, and so attack the Tower, being all the more furious at what they would deem a breach of their {{privileges}} by my taking possession of the gates; and so nothing was done. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> out of the windows across the river? If not, do so." ...|$|E
6000|$|A hundred {{thousand}} barrels of wheat, you say, should be imported hither; and ten thousand pounds premium to the importers. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> into the purse of the nation? I am no {{commissioner of the}} treasury; but am well assured that the whole running cash would not supply you with a sum to purchase so much corn, which, only at twenty shillings a barrel, will be a {{hundred thousand}} pounds; and ten thousand more for the premiums. But you will traffic for your corn with other goods: and where are those goods? if you had them, they are all engaged to pay the rents of absentees, and other occasions in London, besides a huge balance of trade this year against us. Will foreigners take our bankers' papers? I suppose they will value it at little more than so much a quire. Where are these rich farmers and engrossers of corn, in so bad a year, and so little sowing? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Rather {{a strange}} one, Baas, {{for a man}} who is about to go into battle. I dreamed that I was in a large place that was full of quiet. It was light there, but I could not see any sun or moon, and the air was very soft and tasted like food and drink, so much so, Baas, that if anyone had offered me a cup quite full of the best 'Cape smoke' I should have told him to take it away. Then, Baas, {{suddenly}} I saw your reverend father, the Predikant, standing beside me and looking just as he used to look, only younger and stronger and very happy, and so of course knew at once that I was dead and in hell. Only I wondered where the fire that does not go out might be, for I could not see it. Presently your reverend father said to me: 'Good day, Hans. So you have come here at last. Now tell me, how has it gone with my son, the Baas Allan? <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> after him as I told you to do?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But you did {{not tell}} your father or anybody, as <b>you</b> would <b>have</b> if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> upon it then as the insult you now pretend it was.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe {{gave the}} song a B- grade," [...] {{saying that the}} song {{contains}} [...] "heartfelt vocal and sincere delivery." [...] He {{goes on to say}} that [...] "if a lesser singer was at the mic, the sheer implausibility of the lyric would be nakedly evident, but Jackson will <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>looking</b> in the classified section, expecting the chorus to be there." ...|$|R
60|$|LARRY. What call <b>have</b> <b>you</b> to <b>look</b> down on Patsy Farrell? I {{suppose you}} think you're {{everybody}} because {{you own a}} few fields.|$|R
