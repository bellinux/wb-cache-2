25|$|Windows Explorer's task {{panel has}} been removed, {{integrating}} the relevant task options into the toolbar. A Favorites pane {{on the left}} contains commonly accessed folders and prepopulated Search Folders. Seven different views are available to view files and folders, namely, List, Details, Small icons, Medium icons, Large icons, Extra large icons or Tiles. File and folder actions such as Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo, Redo, Delete, Rename and Properties are built into a <b>dropdown</b> menu which appears when the Organize button is clicked. It is also possible to change {{the layout of the}} Explorer window by using the Organize button. Users can select whether to display Classic Menus, a Search Pane, a Preview Pane, a Reading Pane, and/or the Navigation Pane. Document Properties are available from the common 'Open' and 'Save' dialog boxes, so it is easier to add metadata (such as author or subject) to a document. The metadata can be viewed and edited in the Details Pane that shows up at the bottom of an Explorer window. The Navigation Pane contains a list of most common folders (the Favorites) for quick navigation. It can also show the folder layout of the entire hard drive or a subset of it. It can contain both real folders as well as virtual ones. By default it contains links to folders such as Documents and the publicly shared folder, as well as virtual folders that search and present the saved virtual folders and that lists the recently changed documents. The Preview Pane can be used to preview the contents of a document, including viewing pictures in a size larger than the thumbnails shown in the folder listing, and sampling contents of a media file, without opening any additional program. Explorer can show a preview for any image format if the necessary codec authored using the Windows Imaging Component is installed. Also, if an application installs Preview handlers (like Office 2007 does), then the documents can be edited in the preview pane itself.|$|E

40|$|PRE 2 : How to Web 2. 0 This {{session was}} quite {{interesting}} {{in that it}} went over many of todays web 2. 0 websites. The session itself could be considered introductory allowing people to view and play with web 2. 0 websites. It did not go into greater depth of why web 2. 0 could be considered beneficial to an institution or what the adoption rate is like or the technology behind web 2. 0. For this particular presentation I was disappointed at the content that was provided. CONFRENCE: I spent two full days at the conference attending as many workshops as time would allow. These workshops {{for the most part}} were fascinating and the most important thing I learned was that we, as an institution, are not alone in our goals. It was informative to see the many presentations as well as discuss with some of the presenters, the solutions that they have come up with in managing a transition of a rebrand or the implementation of a CMS like alfresco or both concurrently. Numerous ideas were shown by other institutions, which I feel, allowed us (Tim Terry’s group also attended) to bring home the best ideas. It also allowed us to learn of potential roadblocks that we may face that similar institutions have encountered in similar situations with a project like the university is implementing. I would love to do a presentation next year in regards to Google Analytics. There were very little presentations that actually delved into the marketing side of the web and ways in which an institution could increase the amount of traffic driven to there website. We have done this quite successfully and I feel {{that it would be a}} great opportunity to share out story off success, especially in regards to the online ad campaign from the School Of Business. POST 2 : Advanced CSS Workshop This workshop was great fun to attend and a good example in the future of how to present and involve th participants. We went over numerous technologies that can be implement-using CSS. Numerous ideas were shared as well as each participant receiving a cd with the files as well as the completed solutions that were shown. It allowed attendees to follow along and fix mistakes as they went. Overall it was a great presentation that was full of many real world ideas that we as an institution could implement to get us through the next major upgrade to our website. 1) 	PRE 2 : How to [...] . Web 2. 0 PRESENTER: Matthew Winkel, The College of New Jersey ABSTRACT: Does this scenario sound familiar? 1.) You a attended a conference or webinar and learn about Web 2. 0 tools. 2.) You decide to try out one or more of these tools. 3.) You add this task to your to-do list for when you return to work. 4.) But weeks or months go by and you still have not found time to use these new tools. In this half-day workshop you will have the time (and guidance) to set up some of the most popular Web 2. 0 tools available including: Facebook, LinkedIn, Del. icio. us, Google Reader, Wordpress, and Zoho Wiki. We will also discuss best practices for using these tools for higher education Web development. Bring your wifi-enabled laptop. 2) 	POST 2 : Advanced CSS Workshop PRESENTER: Daniel M. Frommelt, University of Wisconsin - Platteville ABSTRACT: A hands-on opportunity to play with some advanced CSS concepts. Bring your laptops and an open mind. Weĺl cover many of the current hot design techniques: multi-column layout, faux-column layout, advanced image replacement techniques, advanced list manipulation, rounded corner boxes, son-of-suckerfish <b>dropdowns,</b> cross-column pull-outs, CSS hacks, and customized CSS for alternate devices. There will also be a discussion of emulators for alternate devices and a discussion about helpful tools for Web developers. Example files will be made available for the session that can be manipulated during the workshop. For those bringing laptops, please have a text editor and the current version of Firefox installed, as well as other browsers your institution may support. If you can not bring a laptop, you will be able to observe and work with the other participants. Final example files will be available on CD at the end of the workshop.
