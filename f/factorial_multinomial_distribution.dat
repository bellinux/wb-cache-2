40|$|In certain {{applications}} it {{is useful}} to fit <b>multinomial</b> <b>distributions</b> to observed data with a penalty term that encourages sparsity. For example, in probabilistic latent audio source decomposition one may wish to encode the assumption that only a few latent sources are active at any given time. The standard heuristic of applying an L 1 penalty is not an option when fitting the parameters to a <b>multinomial</b> <b>distribution,</b> which are constrained to sum to 1. An alternative is to use a penalty term that encourages low-entropy solutions, which corresponds to maximum a posteriori (MAP) parameter estimation with an entropic prior. The lack of conjugacy between the entropic prior and the <b>multinomial</b> <b>distribution</b> complicates this approach. In this report I propose a simple iterative algorithm for MAP estimation of <b>multinomial</b> <b>distributions</b> with sparsity-inducing entropic priors...|$|R

50|$|In {{probability}} theory and statistics, the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution {{is a family}} of discrete multivariate probability distributions on a finite support of non-negative integers. It is also called the Dirichlet compound <b>multinomial</b> <b>distribution</b> (DCM) or multivariate Pólya distribution (after George Pólya). It is a compound probability distribution, where a probability vector p is drawn from a Dirichlet distribution with parameter vector , and an observation drawn from a <b>multinomial</b> <b>distribution</b> with probability vector p and number of trials n. The compounding corresponds to a Polya urn scheme. It is frequently encountered in Bayesian statistics, empirical Bayes methods and classical statistics as an overdispersed <b>multinomial</b> <b>distribution.</b> It reduces to the Categorical distribution as a special case when n = 1. It also approximates the <b>multinomial</b> <b>distribution</b> arbitrarily well for large α. The Dirichlet-multinomial is a multivariate extension of the Beta-binomial <b>distribution,</b> as the <b>multinomial</b> and Dirichlet <b>distributions</b> are multivariate versions of the binomial distribution and beta distributions, respectively.|$|R
