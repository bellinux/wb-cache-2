5000|$|A diverterless {{supersonic}} inlet (DSI) {{is a type}} of {{jet engine}} air intake used by some modern combat aircraft to control air flow into their engines. It consists of a [...] "bump" [...] and a forward-swept <b>inlet</b> <b>cowl,</b> which work together to divert boundary layer airflow away from the aircraft's engine.

The air then entered the engine compressor. Some of this compressor flow (20% at cruise) was removed after the 4th compressor stage and {{went straight to the}} afterburner through six bypass tubes. Air passing through the turbojet was compressed further by the remaining 5 compressor stages and then fuel was added in the combustion chamber. After passing through the turbine the exhaust, together with the compressor bleed air, entered the afterburner.|$|E

To obtain inlet-isolator maximum pressure-rise data relevant to ramjet-engine combustion operation, configurations were mechanically back pressured.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we are {{investigating}} {{a method for}} the design and integration of 3 D external compression inlet geometries on parametric geometries of air-breathing hypersonic aircraft. We view the geometries as {{the first stage of}} a mixed compression inlet. The investigations are based on waverider geometries generated with the osculating cones waverider forebody design method. The osculating cones method is further utilized to create a second compression surface before the <b>inlet</b> <b>cowl,</b> essentially creating a second waverider geometry {{on the underside of the}} forebody. This way, we achieve greater compression for the part of the flow to be captured by the <b>inlet</b> <b>cowl</b> using a geometry that does not require sidewalls (like 2 D ramps do), and has a potentially larger capture area than axisymmetric inlet geometries such as half-cones. The integration method is explained in detail, validated and further examined with CFD simulations. Those include measurements of the sensitivity of the flowfield to angle of attack, sideslip and Mach number changes. A number of options for designing the downstream internal compression part of the inlet are also discussed...|$|E

5000|$|The air inlets {{allowed the}} SR-71 to cruise at over Mach 3.2 while keeping airflow into the engines {{at the initial}} subsonic speeds. Mach 3.2 was the design point for the aircraft, its most {{efficient}} speed. At the front of each inlet, a pointed, movable cone called a [...] "spike" [...] (Inlet cone) was locked in its full forward position {{on the ground and}} during subsonic flight. When the aircraft accelerated past Mach 1.6, an internal jackscrew moved the spike up to 26 in inwards, directed by an analog air inlet computer that took into account pitot-static system, pitch, roll, yaw, and angle of attack. Moving the spike tip drew the shock wave riding on it closer to the <b>inlet</b> <b>cowling</b> until it touched just slightly inside the cowling lip. This position reflected the spike shock-wave repeatedly between the spike centerbody and the <b>inlet</b> inner <b>cowl</b> sides, and minimized airflow spillage which is the cause of spillage drag. The air slowed supersonically with a final plane shock wave at entry to the subsonic diffuser.|$|R

Analytical estimation of valve performance indicates that only the slide and poppet valves located in the <b>inlet</b> <b>cowl</b> can meet the desired steady state stabilizing flows, and of the two the poppet valve is substantially faster in response to dynamic disturbances. The poppet valve is, therefore, selected as the best shock stability system for the YF- 12 inlet...|$|E
40|$|An approximately. 25 {{scale model}} of a Tandem Fan nacelle {{designed}} for a Type A V/STOL aircraft configuration was tested in a 10 -by- 10 foot wind tunnel. A 12 inch, tip driven, turbofan simulator was used to provide the suction source for the aft fan inlet. The front fan inlet was faired over for this test entry. Model variables consisted of a long aft <b>inlet</b> <b>cowl,</b> a short aft <b>inlet</b> <b>cowl,</b> a shaft simulator, blow-in door passages and diffuser vortex generators. Inlet pressure recovery, distortion, inlet angle of attack separation limits were evaluated at tunnel velocities from 0 to 240 knots, angles of attack from - 10 to 40 degrees and inlet flow rates representative of throat Mach numbers of 0. 1 to 0. 6. High inlet performance and stable operation was verified at all design forward speed and angle of attack conditions. The short aft inlet configuration provided exceptionally high pressure recovery except at the highest combination of angle of attack and forward speed. The flow quality at the fan face was somewhat degraded {{by the addition of}} blow-in door passages to the long aft inlet configuration due to the pressure disturbances generated by the flow entering the diffuser through the auxiliary air passages...|$|E

5|$|The {{modified}} air intakes replaced conventional intake rampswhose {{function is}} to divert turbulent boundary layer airflow away from the inlet and prevent it entering the enginewith a diverterless supersonic inlet (DSI) design. The DSI uses a combination of forward-swept <b>inlet</b> <b>cowls</b> and a three-dimensional compression surface to divert the boundary layer airflow at high sub-sonic and supersonic speeds. According to Lockheed Martin, the DSI design prevents most of the boundary layer air from entering the engine at speeds up to two times the speed of sound, reduces weight by removing the need for complex mechanical intake mechanisms, and is stealthier than a conventional intake. In 1999, developmental work on the DSI {{with the aim of}} improving aircraft performance commenced. The JF-17 design was finalised in 2001.

The test was a follow-on to the Two-Dimensional Bifurcated (2 DB) Inlet/Engine test. At the takeoff condition for a High-Speed Civil Transport aircraft, the inlet must provide adequate airflow to the engine with an acceptable distortion level and high-pressure recovery. The test was conducted to study the effectiveness of installing two rotating lips on the 2 DB <b>Inlet</b> <b>cowls</b> to increase mass flow rate and eliminate or reduce boundary layer flow separation near the lips. Hardware was mounted vertically in the test section so that it extended through the tunnel ceiling and that the 2 DB Inlet was exposed to the atmosphere above the test section. The tunnel was configured in the aerodynamic mode, and exhausters were used to pump down the tunnel to vacuum levels and to provide a maximum flow rate of approximately 58 lb/sec. The test determined the (1) maximum flow in the 2 DB Inlet for each variable cowl lip, (2) distortion level and pressure recovery for each lip configuration, (3) boundary layer conditions near variable lips inside the 2 DB Inlet, (4) effects of a wing structure adjacent to the 2 DB Inlet, and (5) effects of different 2 DB Inlet exit configurations.
