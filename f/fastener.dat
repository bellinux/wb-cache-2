5|$|Belt hook: The belt hook was a <b>fastener</b> used in China. Belt hooks {{date to the}} 7th century BC in China, {{and were}} made with bronze, iron, gold, and jade. Texts claim that the belt hook arrived in China from Central Asia during the Warring States period, but archaeological {{evidence}} of belt hooks in China predate the Warring States Period.|$|E
5|$|Integritys first voyage was in February 1804, {{heading south}} along the eastern {{coastline}} of Australia to transport settlers and supplies across Bass Strait to the colonial outpost in Van Diemen's Land. The administrator of that outpost, Lieutenant John Bowen, had recently resigned his position and returned to Port Jackson. Governor King now directed that Bowen travel back to Van Diemen's Land aboard Integrity in order to formalise the transfer of colonial authority to his successor. However Bowen refused to go aboard, and the cutter ultimately sailed without him in order to deliver its supplies. The voyage was a success other than a broken rudder <b>fastener</b> which was repaired when Integrity reached Van Diemen's Land in early March. The cutter then completed the round trip back to Port Jackson, arriving safely at her home port on 24 April.|$|E
25|$|In some applications, joints are {{designed}} so that the <b>fastener</b> eventually fails before more expensive components. In this case, replacing an existing <b>fastener</b> with a higher strength <b>fastener</b> can result in equipment damage. Thus, it is generally good practice to replace old fasteners with new fasteners of the same grade.|$|E

50|$|For certain {{applications}} where safety wiring is common, <b>fasteners</b> come pre-drilled {{with holes}} to accept safety wire. When wiring {{something that did}} not come with pre-drilled <b>fasteners</b> stock, however, the more cost-effective way (as opposed to replacing all stock <b>fasteners</b> with pre-drilled ones of the same type) is often to drill the stock <b>fasteners.</b>|$|R
40|$|Flexible {{composite}} <b>fasteners</b> made of {{polyvinyl chloride}} or other resilient synthetic material designed for joining together various materials which may vary slightly in thickness during use. <b>Fasteners</b> easily installed and removed by hand and maintain approximately same tension in bonding materials together, regardless of subsequent movements of materials. Design and choice of material of new <b>fasteners</b> enables variety of uses, as book binders, hole sealers, insulating <b>fasteners</b> for electronic circuitry, or break-away energy-absorbing <b>fasteners</b> for vehicles in crashes...|$|R
25|$|There is {{no simple}} method to measure the tension of a <b>fastener</b> already in place other than to tighten it and {{identify}} {{at which point the}} <b>fastener</b> starts extending. This is known as re-torqueing. An electronic torque wrench can be used on the <b>fastener</b> in question, so that the torque applied can be constantly measured as it is slowly increased in magnitude.|$|E
25|$|String <b>fastener</b> or bridge: Boxwood.|$|E
25|$|When the {{fastened}} {{parts are}} less stiff than the <b>fastener</b> (those that use soft, compressed gaskets for example), this model breaks {{down and the}} <b>fastener</b> is subjected to a tension load that {{is the sum of}} the tension preload and the external tension load.|$|E
40|$|Eddy-current {{apparatus}} {{for inspection}} of bolts, studs, and other threaded <b>fasteners</b> detects flaws in threads, shanks, and head fillets. With help of apparatus, technician quickly inspects <b>fasteners</b> of various dimensions. Accommodates <b>fasteners</b> with diameters from 0. 190 in. to 1 in. and with lengths up to 5 in. Basic design modified to accommodate <b>fasteners</b> of other sizes...|$|R
40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{part of the}} thesis focuses on the history and present selected <b>fasteners.</b> For {{the period of the}} first elements of <b>fasteners,</b> the development of mass production and standardization process follows the thread until today. In the practical part are present selected individual types of <b>fasteners,</b> their properties and uses. Individual elements of <b>fasteners</b> are classified according to the manner of their use...|$|R
50|$|Threaded <b>fasteners</b> {{either have}} a tapered shank or a non-tapered shank. <b>Fasteners</b> with tapered shanks are {{designed}} to either be driven into a substrate directly or into a pilot hole in a substrate. Mating threads are formed in the substrate as these <b>fasteners</b> are driven in. <b>Fasteners</b> with a non-tapered shank {{are designed to}} mate with a nut or to be driven into a tapped hole.|$|R
25|$|The clamp load, {{also called}} preload of a <b>fastener,</b> is created when a torque is applied, and so {{develops}} a tensile preload that is generally a substantial {{percentage of the}} fastener's proof strength. Fasteners are manufactured to various standards that define, among other things, their strength. Torque charts are available to specify the required torque for a given <b>fastener</b> based on its property class (fineness of manufacture and fit) and grade (tensile strength).|$|E

25|$|Schiaparelli {{is one of}} the {{designers}} credited with offering the first clothes with visible zippers in 1930. Rather than being concealed, zippers became a key element of Schiaparelli's designs, visibly fastening necklines and running down sleeves and skirts. She used chunky plastic zippers made from cellulose nitrate, the first semi-synthetic plastic fabric, and cellulose acetate. Along with Charles James, Schiaparelli had arrangements with the manufacturers to promote their zip fasteners, using specific brands depending on where the garment would be sold (such as Éclair for Paris models, Lightning <b>Fastener</b> Co. for London models, and Hookless <b>Fastener</b> Co. zips for American export models).|$|E
30|$|Various {{mechanical}} <b>fasteners</b> {{are used}} in timber constructions alone or combined with other <b>fasteners</b> to resist loads and external forces. Timber joints with <b>fasteners</b> of each kind have their unique load–displacement characteristics, which {{make it difficult to}} evaluate the design resistance of combined joints with different kinds of <b>fasteners</b> by a common standard method. Considering this difficulty, the current Japanese standard for timber structures [1] does not allow summation of the allowable resistance of timber joints with different <b>fasteners</b> in common with most of the other codes or standards.|$|R

5000|$|Various {{mechanical}} <b>fasteners</b> may be used, {{the simplest}} being nails and screws. Glue and <b>fasteners</b> {{can be used}} together.|$|R
25|$|For cyclic tension loads, the <b>fastener</b> is not {{subjected}} to the full amplitude of the load; as a result, the fastener's fatigue life is increased or—if the material exhibits an endurance limit its life extends indefinitely.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{different}} types of heavy-duty clips are used to fasten the rails to the underlying baseplate, one common one being the Pandrol <b>fastener</b> (Pandrol clip), named after its maker, which is shaped like a stubby paperclip. Another one is the Vossloh Tension Clamp.|$|E
25|$|Overtorquing {{might cause}} failure by {{damaging}} the threads and deforming the <b>fastener,</b> though {{this can happen}} over a very long time. Undertorquing can cause failures by allowing a joint to come loose, and it may also allow the joint to flex and thus fail under fatigue.|$|E
50|$|All ACQ {{treatments}} accelerate corrosion {{of metal}} <b>fasteners</b> relative to untreated wood. Hot-dipped galvanized,copper or stainless steel <b>fasteners</b> must be used.|$|R

50|$|The {{stress and}} shear in a rivet is {{analyzed}} like a bolted joint. However, {{it is not}} wise to combine rivets with bolts and screws in the same joint. Rivets fill the hole where they are installed to establish a very tight fit (often called interference fit). It is difficult or impossible to obtain such a tight fit with other <b>fasteners.</b> The result is that rivets in the same joint with loose <b>fasteners</b> carry more of the load—they are effectively more stiff. The rivet can then fail before it can redistribute load to the other loose fit <b>fasteners</b> like bolts and screws. This often causes catastrophic failure of the joint when the <b>fasteners</b> unzip. In general, a joint composed of similar <b>fasteners</b> is the most efficient because all <b>fasteners</b> reach capacity simultaneously.|$|R
25|$|Engineered joints {{require the}} torque {{to be chosen}} to provide the correct tension preload. Applying the torque to {{fasteners}} is commonly achieved using a torque wrench. The required torque value for a particular <b>fastener</b> application may be quoted in the published standard document, defined by the manufacturer or calculated.|$|E
25|$|In this decade, {{companies}} also began selling buttonless drawers fitted with an elastic waistband. These {{were the first}} true boxer shorts, which were named for their resemblance to the shorts worn by professional fighters. Scovil Manufacturing introduced the snap <b>fastener</b> at this time, which became a popular addition to various kinds of undergarments.|$|E
25|$|A bowtie {{cotter pin}} is a formed wire <b>fastener</b> that resembles an R-clip, except it {{positively}} locks when installed. Rue S. Leitzke and Roman J. Baus first patented the bowtie cotter pin in 1999. U.S. patent #6,135,693 was filed on March 23, 1999 and issued to Leitzke and Baus on October 24, 2000.|$|E
25|$|The {{preferred}} bolt preload {{for structural}} applications {{should be at}} least 75% of the <b>fastener's</b> proof load for the higher strength <b>fasteners</b> and as high as 90% of the proof load for permanent <b>fasteners.</b> To achieve the benefits of the preloading, the clamping force must be higher than the joint separation load. For some joints, multiple <b>fasteners</b> are required to secure the joint; these are all hand tightened before the final torque is applied to ensure an even joint seating.|$|R
50|$|The PLCE webbing {{system is}} {{produced}} from double-layered 1000 Denier internally rubberised Cordura Nylon, a long lasting and hard wearing fabric. Olive (OD/OG) webbing {{of the same}} material (1000 D) is being incorporated, along {{with a variety of}} hard wearing plastic <b>fasteners</b> (ITW Nexus), Hook and loop <b>fasteners</b> (Velcro) and anti-magnetic press stud <b>fasteners</b> (Pull the Dot).|$|R
40|$|Technology on <b>fasteners</b> and {{fastening}} devices is presented, {{as part of}} NASA's TU program to provide technical information on devices, methods, and techniques resulting from aerospace research. The material {{is divided into two}} sections which include: (1) data concerning a selected group of <b>fasteners</b> and concept for <b>fasteners</b> such as locking devices, couplings, and connect and release mechanisms; and (2) discussions on a number of fastening techniques such as those for mounting panel lamps, clamping flange bolts, stretching <b>fasteners,</b> and transferring fuel from a tanker to another vehicle...|$|R
25|$|Swiss {{electrical}} engineer George de Mestral invented his first touch <b>fastener</b> when, in 1941, {{he went for}} a walk in the woods and wondered why Burdock seeds cling to his coat and dog. He discovered it could be turned into something useful. He patented it in 1955 and subsequently refined and developed its practical manufacture until its commercial introduction in the late 1950s.|$|E
25|$|A {{torque wrench}} {{is a tool}} used to {{precisely}} apply a specific torque to a <b>fastener</b> such as a nut or bolt. It is usually {{in the form of}} a socket wrench with special internal mechanisms. It was invented by Conrad Charles Bahr in 1918. However, it wasn't until much later on March 16, 1937, that Bahr received U.S. patent #2,074,079 for the invention of the torque wrench.|$|E
25|$|The Mk.4 {{seat was}} {{designed}} as an improved, lightweight version of earlier Martin-Baker seats for installation {{in a range of}} lighter, smaller aircraft types. Improvements included a single combined seat and parachute quick release <b>fastener</b> (QRF) and a snubber mechanism to allow crews to lean forward without loosening the harness. The first successful ejection using a Mk.4 seat took place in March 1957, the aircraft involved being a Fiat G.91.|$|E
50|$|Mating <b>fasteners</b> {{are known}} by many {{different}} names: sex bolt, binding posts, Chicago screws, interscrews, barrel bolts, barrel nut, partition screws, door closure bolts, furniture screws, panel <b>fasteners,</b> architectural sex bolts, arch series screws, hinge screws, display <b>fasteners,</b> screw nuts, connector bolts, threaded rivets, grommet nuts, post and screw sets, book screws, and stationary screws. Applications vary widely from book binding to installing bathroom partitions. This group of <b>fasteners</b> {{are used to}} assemble fitness apparatus, solar panels, playground equipment, railing systems, furniture, athletic helmets, knives, store fixtures, signs, panic bars, and many other products.|$|R
5000|$|... For {{many years}} {{non-standard}} 1-inch 14-tpi {{nuts and bolts}} {{have been widely used}} instead of standard-sized 1-inch 12-tpi fasteners; consequently 1″-14 <b>fasteners</b> are easier to find and less expensive than 1″-12 <b>fasteners.</b> After several decades 1″-14 <b>fasteners</b> have now come to be commonly referred to as [...] "Standard Fine Thread" [...] or [...] "UNF". Though technically incorrect (the UNF standard specifies 1″-12), size 1″-14 is universally accepted as standard for fine-threaded 1-inch <b>fasteners,</b> and [...] "1-inch 14-tpi NF" [...] has become established as a [...] "common use" [...] term, or [...] "a genericized brand name/standard". In other words, the 1″-12 standard has lacked effective enforcement for a long enough time (many decades) to give generic trademark-like status to 1-inch 14-tpi <b>fasteners.</b>|$|R
