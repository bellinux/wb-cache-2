This is a natural result {{of the behavior of}} quantum bits; due to the observer effect, if a bit in a superposition state were to be observed, the superposition state would collapse into an eigenstate. Because the intended recipient was expecting to receive the bit in a superposition state, the intended recipient would <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> an attack, because the bit's state would no longer be in a superposition.|$|E
25|$|No. 8 (Guards) Commando was {{a unit of}} the British Commandos {{and part}} of the British Army during the Second World War. The Commando was formed in June 1940 {{primarily}} from members of the Brigade of Guards. It was one of the units selected to be sent to the Middle East as part of Layforce. On arrival they became known as 'B' Battalion in an attempt at deception, not wanting the Axis forces to <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a commando formation in the theatre of war. The commando participated in the Battle of Crete and around Tobruk before being disbanded in late 1941. After this, many of its personnel went on to serve in other commando units formed in the area, including the Special Air Service.|$|E
