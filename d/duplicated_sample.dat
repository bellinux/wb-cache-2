40|$|A {{methodology}} is proposed, {{which employs}} duplicated primary sampling and subsequent duplicated physical preparation coupled with duplicated chemical analyses. Sample preparation duplicates {{should be prepared}} under conditions that represent normal variability in routine laboratory practice. The proposed methodology requires duplicated chemical analysis {{on a minimum of}} two of the sample preparation duplicates. Data produced from the hierarchical design is treated with robust analysis of variance (ANOVA) to generate uncertainty estimates, as standard uncertainties (`u¿ expressed as standard deviation), for primary sampling (ssamp), physical sample preparation (sprep) and chemical analysis (sanal). The ANOVA results allow the contribution of the sample preparation process to the overall uncertainty to be assessed. This methodology has been applied {{for the first time to}} a case study of pesticide residues in retail strawberry samples. <b>Duplicated</b> <b>sample</b> preparation was performed under ambient conditions on two consecutive days. Multi-residue analysis (quantification by GC-MS) was undertaken for a range of incurred pesticide residues including those suspected of being susceptible to loss during sample preparation procedures. Sampling and analytical uncertainties dominated at low analyte concentrations. The sample preparation process contributed up to 20 % to the total variability and had a relative uncertainty (Uprep%) of up to 66 % (for bupirimate at 95 % confidence). Estimates of systematic errors during physical sample preparation were also made using spike recovery experiments. Four options for the estimation of measurement uncertainty are discussed, which both include and exclude systematic error arising from sample preparation and chemical analysis. A holistic approach to the combination and subsequent expression of uncertainty is advised...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Adrenal vein {{sampling}} (AVS) is {{the preferred}} test for subtyping primary aldosteronism. However, the procedure is technically demanding and costly. In AVS it is common practice to take <b>duplicate</b> blood <b>samples</b> at each location. In this paper we explore whether a single sample procedure leads to a different conclusion concerning the location of adrenal aldosterone secretion than a <b>duplicate</b> <b>sample</b> procedure. METHODS: AVS procedures with duplicate measurements performed in our university medical center between 2005 and 2010 were evaluated retrospectively. We compared the conclusions regarding selectivity and lateralization based on the first sample taken (A) to the conclusions based on the average of <b>duplicate</b> <b>samples</b> (AB). We also calculated the number needed to be <b>sampled</b> in <b>duplicate</b> to prevent one misclassification. RESULTS: Ninety-six AVS procedures of 82 patients were included. The concordance in AVS conclusions between samples A and AB was 98 - 100 %, depending on the criteria used for selectivity and lateralization. With permissive and strict criteria the number needed to be <b>sampled</b> in <b>duplicate</b> were infinite and 48, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The incremental benefit of <b>duplicate</b> <b>sampling</b> compared to single sampling is low. Therefore, {{in the case of}} technical difficulties during AVS, conclusions can also be reliably drawn from a single blood sample...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{methods for}} calculating confidence intervals for estimates of sampling uncertainty (ssamp) and analytical uncertainty (sanal) using the ¿-squared distribution. These uncertainty estimates {{are derived from}} application of the duplicate method, which recommends a minimum of eight <b>duplicate</b> <b>samples.</b> The methods are applied to two case studies ¿ moisture in butter and nitrate in lettuce. Use of the recommended minimum of eight <b>duplicate</b> <b>samples</b> is justified for both case studies as the confidence intervals calculated using greater than eight duplicates did not show any appreciable reduction in width.

Aspirate and brush samples were reported on separately by two cytologists. At {{the end of the}} study a 30 % sample, including the 19 cases with different findings by the two methods, were subjected to a blind crossover review, and then an open review. Forceps biopsy specimens for routine histological assessment were taken in 94 cases (92 %). Ninety-eight of 103 (95 %) aspirates and 99 of 103 (96 %) brush specimens were technically satisfactory. Carcinoma was diagnosed at bronchoscopy on cytological or histological evidence or both in 57 cases. Fifty-five of these tumours (96 %) were recognised by either the aspirate or the brush method, 52 (91 %) by brush, and 50 (88 %) by aspirate. Thirty-four cases (60 %) could be diagnosed from histological specimens. The order of cytological sampling did not systematically affect yield. It is concluded that fine-catheter aspirates, permitting smears to be prepared in the laboratory, are a satisfactory alternative to brush smears for the cytological diagnosis of lung cancer at bronchoscopy.
