60|$|The Mammalia {{have not}} been {{collected}} with sufficient completeness in both islands to make a general comparison of much value, and so many species have been obtained only as live specimens in captivity, that their locality has often been erroneously given, the island {{in which they were}} obtained being substituted for that from which they originally came. Taking into consideration only those whose distribution is more accurately known, we learn that Sumatra is, in a zoological sense, more nearly related to Borneo than it is to Java. The great man-like apes, the elephant, the tapir, and the Malay bear, are all common to the two former countries, while they are absent from the latter. Of the three long-tailed monkeys (Semnopithecus) inhabiting Sumatra, one extends into Borneo, but the two species of Java are both peculiar to it. So also the great Malay deer (Rusa equina), and the small Tragulus <b>kanchil,</b> are common to Sumatra and Borneo, but do not extend into Java, where they are replaced by Tragulas javanicus. The tiger, it is true, is found in Sumatra and Java, but not in Borneo. But as this animal is known to swim well, it may have found its way across the Straits of Sunda, or it may have inhabited Java before it was separated from the mainland, and from some unknown cause have ceased to exist in Borneo.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, {{only two}} species of mouse-deer in the genus Tragulus have been recognized: The {{relatively}} large T. napu and the small T. javanicus. Following a review in 2004, T. nigricans and T. versicolor were split from T. napu, and T. <b>kanchil</b> and T. williamsoni was split from T. javanicus. With these changes, T. <b>kanchil</b> and T. napu are the most widespread species, while the remaining have far smaller distributions (though some uncertainty over the exact distribution limits of the various species in Indochina remain).|$|E

5000|$|The Vietnam mouse-deer (Tragulus versicolor), {{also known}} as the silver-backed chevrotain, is a species of even-toed {{ungulate}} in the family Tragulidae that at present only is known from Vietnam. Until 2004, it was generally treated as a subspecies of the greater mouse-deer (T. napu), though it more closely resembles the lesser mouse-deer (T. <b>kanchil).</b> Recent records of this very poorly known species are missing, but this is more likely due to the difficulty involved in separating it from other mouse-deer and the general absence of field work within its presumed range than it being extinct. The Silver-backed Chevrotain is among the 25 “most wanted lost” species that are the focus of Global Wildlife Conservation’s “Search for Lost Species” initiative.|$|E
50|$|Manu, {{a doctor}} {{who lives in the}} U.S., visits his mother along with his wife and daughter, in the ancestral house after several years. Ajjamma (Manu’s mother) tells Manu that she had promised to perform the <b>Kanchil</b> {{ceremony}} if a girl was born to her son, but Manu dismisses it as a “blind belief”. She made the promise as her son and daughter-in-law did not have a child even after more than four years of marriage. Manu said that he would not allow his daughter to participate in the ceremony as {{he and his wife had}} deferred having a baby because she was still pursuing her studies for some years after they got married. In many ways, the film is about negotiating between tradition and modernity, and faith and superstition, as well as the omnipresent caste. Manu’s wife suggests that there is no harm in letting the ceremony as it would please the old woman. Manu remained adamant arguing that his daughter was not born because god willed it to happen.|$|E
50|$|The Java mouse-deer’s common {{scientific}} name is Tragulus javanicus, although other classification names for it exist, including Tragulus javanica, Cervus javanicus, and the heterotypic synonym Tragulus fuscatus. The Java mouse-deer {{is also known}} by many common names, including Javan chevrotain, Javan mousdeer, or Java Mousedeer. The taxonomic status of the Java mouse-deer is questionable, but recent craniometric analyses have begun {{to shed light on}} the taxonomic discrepancies. Previously, the Java mouse-deer, Tragulus javanicus, was commonly thought to represent the wider class of large chevrotains, but it was found that these, unlike the Java mouse-deer, do not likely reside on Java. Three species groups of Tragulus have been identified based on craniometric skull analyses and coat coloration patterns. These three species groups are Tragulus javanicus, Tragulus napu, and Tragulus versicolor. Based upon these craniometric analyses, Tragulus javanicus was then further separated based on the organisms’ known geographic locations: Tragulus williamsoni (found in northern Thailand and possibly southern China), Tragulus <b>kanchil</b> (found in Borneo, Sumatra, the Thai-Malay Peninsula, islands within the Greater Sunda region, and continental Southeast Asia), and Tragulus javanicus (found in Java). Thus, because of its uniqueness to the island of Java, the Java mouse-deer is now considered a distinct species, although this fact has not significantly affected its current classification.|$|E
40|$|Genus Tragulus in Indonesia is {{consisted}} of three species, namely Tragulus javanicus, T. napu, and T. <b>kanchil.</b> These three species are distributed in Kalimantan (Borneo), Java, Sumatra and Lesser Sundaislands. Taxonomically, based on morphological characteristic,T. javanicus is the same species as T. kanchil,while T. napu have differences in body size compared to the previous species. The status of genus Tragulusin Indonesia are protected by the law and categorized as least concern for T. napu and data deficient for T. javanicus in the IUCN Redlist. The aims {{of this study was}} to look at genetic variation among species andkinship based on mitochondrial DNA gene genus Tragulus. Genes used in this study was 12 S ribosomalRNA with 300 bp long, using eight samples orginated from Singkep Islands (four individuals), MountHalimun, West Java (three individuals) and East Kalimantan (one individual). As a comparisons, publishednucleotide sequence of each species from GeneBank database were used. The results showed that thegenetic distances (d) between individuals is high d = 0. 322 ± 0. 023 with the nucleotide diversity (ð) = 0. 2402 which indicates that samples was {{consisted of}} samples from different species. Phylogenetic treebased on the nucleotide analysis indicatedthat these samples composed of three species namely T. javanicus,T. <b>kanchil</b> and T. napu. Samples from Mt. Halimun and East Kalimantan are clustered in one group,namely T. <b>kanchil</b> (Borneo) and T. javanicus (Mt. Halimun). Two samples from Singkep are clustered indifferent groups with the possibility as T. napu...|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{activity}} patterns of Bornean ungulates, or the temporal interactions of these species with the Sunda clouded leopard Neofelis diardi. In this study, we use photographic capture data to quantify the activity patterns for the Sunda clouded leopard and six potential prey species: bearded pig Sus barbatus, Bornean yellow muntjac Muntiacus atherodes, red muntjac Muntiacusmuntjak, lesser mouse deer Tragulus <b>kanchil,</b> greater mouse deer Tragulusnapu, and sambar deer Rusa unicolor, and to calculate the overlap in activity patterns between these species. This is the first insight into the temporal interactions between the Sunda clouded leopard and its potential prey. Sunda clouded leopards' activity patterns overlapped most with those of sambar deer and greater mouse deer. In the absence of clouded leopards, we report a significant difference in activity patterns for bearded pigs which show greater nocturnal activity in the absence of this predator. This suggests that bearded pigs may be prey species for clouded leopards and they are capable of altering their activity pattern in response to this risk. © 2013 The Zoological Society of London...|$|E
