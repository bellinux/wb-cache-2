5|$|Robert Urie {{completed}} his H15class mixed-traffic 4-6-0 design in 1913 and the prototype {{was built in}} August 1914. <b>It</b> <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> marked improvement in performance over Dugald Drummond’s LSWR T14 class 4-6-0 when tested on local and express passenger trains. The introduction of ten H15 engines into service coincided with {{the outbreak of the}} First World War, which prevented construction of further class members. Despite the interruption caused by the conflict, Urie anticipated that peacetime increases in passenger traffic would necessitate longer trains from London to the south-west of England. Passenger loadings on the heavy boat trains to the London and South Western Railway’s (LSWR) ports of Portsmouth, Weymouth and Southampton had been increasing prior to the war, and was beginning to overcome the capabilities of the LSWR’s passenger locomotive fleet. His response was to produce a modern, standard express passenger design similar to the H15.|$|E
5|$|The idea {{of using}} aspirin to prevent {{clotting}} diseases (such as heart attacks and strokes) was revived in the 1960s, when medical researcher Harvey Weiss found that aspirin had an anti-adhesive effect on blood platelets (and unlike other potential antiplatelet drugs, aspirin had low toxicity). Medical Research Council haematologist John O'Brien picked up on Weiss's finding and, in 1963, began working with epidemiologist Peter Elwood on aspirin's anti-thrombosis drug potential. Elwood began a large-scale trial of aspirin as a preventive drug for heart attacks. Nicholas Laboratories agreed to provide aspirin tablets, and Elwood enlisted heart attack survivors in a double-blind controlled study—heart attack survivors were statistically {{more likely to suffer}} a second attack, greatly reducing the number of patients necessary to reliably detect whether aspirin had an effect on heart attacks. The study began in February 1971, though the researchers soon had to break the double-blinding when a study by American epidemiologist Hershel Jick suggested that aspirin prevented heart attacks but suggested that the heart attacks were more deadly. Jick had found that fewer aspirin-takers were admitted to his hospital for heart attacks than non-aspirin-takers, and one possible explanation was that aspirin caused heart attack sufferers to die before reaching the hospital; Elwood's initial results ruled out that explanation. When the Elwood trial ended in 1973, <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> modest but not statistically significant reduction in heart attacks among the group taking aspirin.|$|E
25|$|As {{with most}} other American comic strips, Beetle Bailey has been censored {{from time to}} time. In 1962, the comic strip was censored because <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> belly button, and in 2006, the {{description}} of Rocky's criminal past was replaced with a non-criminal past.|$|E

25|$|The {{subsequent}} 1939 census {{was organized}} {{in a manner}} that certainly inflated data on population numbers. <b>It</b> <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> population figure of 170.6 million people, manipulated so as to match the numbers stated by Joseph Stalin in his report to the 18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party that March. No other census in the Soviet Union was conducted until 1959.|$|E

25|$|Research {{suggests}} that people younger than 40 years also show a reminiscence bump. It was initially hidden {{because of the}} possibility of the recency effect. When researchers examined the encoding values, <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> progressive increase with participant age around the reminiscence bump for participants older than 50. This proves that the reminiscence bump is stronger for older adults than younger adults.|$|E
25|$|A Cochrane {{systematic}} review updated in 2012 showed that blastocyst stage transfer {{is more effective}} than cleavage (day 2 or 3) stage transfer in assisted reproductive technologies. <b>It</b> <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> small improvement in live birth rate per couple for blastocyst transfers. This would mean that for a typical rate of 31% in clinics that use early cleavage stage cycles, the rate would increase to 32% to 42% live births if clinics used blastocyst transfer.|$|E

25|$|A coupe {{version of}} the Shelby Cobra {{roadster}} was introduced the following year. The Ford Shelby GR-1 concept car of 2005. While sporting a completely modern design, <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> nod to the 1960s Shelby Daytona. The GR-1, like the Cobra, {{is based on the}} GT's chassis. Press reviews for the GR-1 have been positive. The car was featured on the cover of Motor Trend and Car Magazine. The Ford Shelby GR-1 could possibly be built, taking over the Ford GT's production line after its production comes to an end.|$|E
25|$|The painter Edwin Henry Landseer {{submitted}} a picture called 'The Shrew Tamed' for the Royal Academy exhibition of 1861. <b>It</b> <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> beautiful girl in riding habit reclining against {{the neck of}} a horse which is on its knees among the straw. It was ostensibly not a portrait of Walters, but the alleged model, the noted horsewoman Annie Gilbert, resembles her, and the juxtaposition of horse, beautiful woman and prevailing mood of languor troubled contemporary critics; some clearly assumed Walters herself had been the subject. The picture gained the alternative title of 'The Pretty Horsebreaker'.|$|E

25|$|In 1815, a German Confederation (Bund) of 39 loosely united German {{states was}} founded on the {{territory}} of the former Holy Roman Empire. Until 1848, the confederation did not have a coat of arms of its own. The Federal Diet (Bundestag) meeting at Frankfurt am Main used a seal which carried the emblem of the Austrian Empire, since Austria had taken over the union's leadership. <b>It</b> <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> black, double-headed eagle, which Austria had adopted just before the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation.|$|E

25|$|In November 1993 Chinese paleontologists Zhou Zhonge, Hu Yoaming and Hou Lianhai, of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology at Beijing, were {{presented}} a bird fossil {{bought at a}} flea market in Sihetun by amateur paleontologist Zhang He. <b>It</b> <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> partial skeleton of a bird new to science of which even some feather remains had been preserved. In December 1993 two further specimens were acquired from a farmer, Yang Yushan. Soon afterwards, it was discovered that local farmers {{were in the process of}} collecting hundreds of specimens that were provisionally prepared by them to be illegally sold to commercial fossil dealers. Many hundreds have since also been added to the official collections of Chinese institutions. In 2010 the Shandong Tianyu Museum of Nature alone possessed 536 specimens. The fossils are compressed but otherwise typically very complete often showing the entire feathering of the animal.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} first {{selective}} COX-2 inhibitor was marketed, specialists began to suspect {{that there might be}} a cardiovascular risk associated with this class of medicines. In the VIGOR study (Vioxx Gastrointestinal Outcomes Research), rofecoxib (Vioxx) was compared to naproxen. After a short time, it became evident that there was a fivefold higher risk of myocardial infarction in the rofecoxib group compared to the group that received naproxen. The authors suggested that the difference was due to the cardioprotective effects of naproxen. The APPROVe (Adenomatous Poly Prevention on Vioxx) study was a multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind trial aimed to assess the effect of three-year treatment with rofecoxib on recurrence of neoplastic polyps in individuals with a history of colorectal adenomas. In 2000 and 2001, 2587 patients with a history of colorectal adenomas were recruited and followed. The trial was stopped early (2 months before expected completion) on recommendations of its data safety and monitoring board because of concerns about cardiovascular toxicity. When looking at the results of the study, <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> statistically significant increase in cardiovascular risk when taking rofecoxib compared to placebo beginning after 18 months of treatment. Then on 30 September Merck gave out a news release announcing their voluntary worldwide withdrawal of Vioxx.|$|E
