40|$|Introduction: Non‐conventional {{techniques}} {{represent a}} {{more and more}} frequently employed alternative in medi‐ cine, firstly due to their minimally invasive character. Laser technologies represent forward‐looking methods to which numerous stomatologists resort, mainly because of their multiple applications in periodontology. The scope {{of the study was}} to identify the possible morpho‐histological differences on microscopic preparati‐ ons obtained by the two ‐ conventional and non‐conventi‐ onal – laser‐assisted techniques. Materials and method: <b>Gingivectomies</b> have been rea‐ lized on a mandible of freshly sacrificed pig, by the classi‐ cal surgical technique, 10 tissue samples of comparable size being taken over. On the same mandible, in the opposite quadrant, <b>gingivectomies</b> were realized by means of a diode‐type laser with a wavelength of 940 nm, followed by taking over of other 10 tissue samples. All specimens were conserved in a fixing solution and histological cups were obtained for subsequent analysis in the laboratory of pathological anatomy. Results and discussion: Histological evaluation evi‐ denced no significant morpho‐histological differences between the two techniques applied. The clinical advanta‐ ges of the photo‐mecanical interactions provided by laser‐assisted periodontal surgery include mainly reduc‐ tion of bleeding, absence of oedema, a higher confort for the patient (who suffers less pain) and a much more rapid healing (by a faster tissular repair). Conclusions: Laser‐assisted technologies may be the‐ refore viewed as extremely useful alternatives in the new periodontal therapies, which recommends their applica‐ tion in periodontal surgery for at least three reasons: they are minimally invasive, they induce minor morpho‐histo‐ logical modifications and the technique of their application is simple to learn...|$|R
40|$|Routine histologic {{examination}} of gingival tissue excised during <b>gingivectomies</b> for inflammatory gingival disease revealed {{the presence of}} peculiar corpuscular formations within the corium.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The material consisted of 74 consecutive gingival biopsies from patients of both sexes whose ages ranged between fifteen and forty-three years. The biopsies were fixed in 10 per cent formalin solution.

30|$|This {{clinical}} trial was limited by some factors. The subjective quality of pain influenced by interindividual and cultural/demographic variations affects its assessment [20],[34],[38]-[44]. Therefore, we used VAS, which is understandable by most patients, has proper sensitivity, and is reliable/reproducible [38]-[40],[44],[45]. As another limitation, analgesic consumption is a confounder of pain [20],[34],[46],[47]. Therefore, we recorded the pain also before the analgesic consumption. Another limitation {{was the lack}} of blinding. However, the patients were not aware of the potential effects of laser on bleeding and pain. Thus, their responses were less likely biased by their knowledge of their group allocation. Moreover, it seemed impossible to blind the operator or the patient in such a design. The generalizability of this study might be reduced by the uniform sample of fixed orthodontic patients all needing esthetic-only <b>gingivectomies,</b> as {{this is not the case}} in everyday orthodontic practice. However, such a uniform sample was necessary to establish a proper level of internal reliability. Moreover, the results of this laser cannot be necessarily generalized to other types or wavelengths of lasers. Future multicenter trials performed by different surgeons with different levels of experience might favor the generalizability. As well, such studies can be benefited from split-mouth designs.|$|R

On the other occasion, lidocaine 2 % with epinephrine 1 : 80, 000 was given. Postoperative pain intensity was recorded by the patients on a 100 -mm visual analogue scale every hour during an 11 -hour observation period. The mean pain intensity was numerically higher after lidocaine 2 % at 0 hours and 1 hour postoperatively.

40|$|Background: Treatment of {{excessive}} gingival display usually involves procedures such as Le Fort impaction or maxillary <b>gingivectomies.</b> The authors propose an alternative technique {{that reduces the}} muscular function of the elevator of the upper lip muscle and repositioning of the upper lip. Methods: Fourteen female patients with excessive gingival exposure were operated on between February of 2008 and March of 2009. They were filmed before and at least 6 months after the procedure. They were asked to perform their fullest smile, and the maximum gingival exposures were measured and analyzed using ImageJ software. Patients were operated on under local anesthesia. Their gingival mucosa was freed from the maxilla using a periosteum elevator. Skin and subcutaneous tissue were dissected bluntly from the underlying musculature of the upper lip. A frenuloplasty was performed to lengthen the upper lip. Both levator labii superioris muscles were dissected and divided. Results: The postoperative course was uneventful {{in all of the}} patients. The mean gingival exposure before surgery was 5. 22 +/- 1. 48 mm; 6 months after surgery, it was 1. 91 +/- 1. 50 mm. The mean gingival exposure reduction was 3. 31 +/- 1. 05 mm (p < 0. 001), ranging from 1. 59 to 4. 83 mm. Conclusion: This study shows that the proposed technique was efficient in reducing the amount of exposed gum during smile in all patients in this series. (Plast. Reconstr.

Quantification of the surgical-anesthetic incidents. Study design: We aimed to perform a retrospective and descriptive analysis of disabled patients who had received oral ambulatory surgery under general anesthesia. Data obtained from the clinical history and telephone interview included the demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, previous dental history, cause of the mental disability, degree of mental retardation, comorbidity measured according to {{the scale of the}} American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), anesthesia or preoperative surgical treatments, level of analgesia, length of stay, incidents in the Resuscitation Ward, the rate of substitution, suspensions, patients admitted, complications and the degree of patient satisfaction. Results: We included 112 oral surgery procedures performed on disabled patients who were treated under general inhalational anesthesia as part of MAS during the years 2006 - 2007. During this period, 577 restorations, 413 extractions, 179 sealants, 102 pulpectomies, 22 root canal treatments, 17 <b>gingivectomies</b> and 3 frenectomies were performed. A total of 75 % (78 cases) of the patients had coexisting medical pathology. The average surgery time per patient was 72. 69 ± 29. 78 minutes. The rate of replacement was 100 %. The rate of suspension was 1. 92 %. The percentage of patients readmitted was 1. 92 %,due to significant bleeding in the mouth, which did not require treatment and the patients were discharged from hospital 24 hours after being admitted.

50|$|One type of {{procedure}} that can be executed is as follows: Removal of excess tissue under anesthesia through an internal bevel <b>gingivectomy</b> or undisplaced flap followed by gingivoplasty and continuous sling suture placements and periodontal dressing; after about a week of recovery after the surgery, remove sutures and periodically do observational evaluations to look for any signs of re-occurrence.|$|E
50|$|In a gingival pocket, no {{destruction}} of the connective tissue fibers (gingival fibers) or alveolar bone occurs. This early sign of disease in the mouth is completely reversible when the etiology of the edematous reaction is eliminated and frequently occurs without dental surgical therapy.

50|$|In 2002, {{researchers}} {{described the}} SOS1 gene and proved {{for the first}} time that a single-nucleotide-insertion mutation of the SOS1 gene on codon 1083 is the preliminary cause of HGF1 in humans.

Researchers approached this issue with periodontics - a partial <b>gingivectomy</b> and flap surgery. This case study concluded that surgery followed by regular follow-ups is a good way to treat HGF despite the fact that the risks of re-occurrence of the condition remain high.|$|E
50|$|The gingival cavity microecosystem, {{fueled by}} food {{residues}} and saliva, can support {{the growth of}} many microorganisms, of which some can be injurious to health. Improper or insufficient oral hygiene can thus lead to many gum and periodontal disorders, including gingivitis or periodontitis, which are major causes for tooth failure. Recent studies have also shown that anabolic steroids are also closely associated with gingival enlargement requiring a <b>gingivectomy</b> for many cases. Gingival recession is {{when there is an}} apical movement of the gum margin away from the biting (occlusal) surface. It may indicate an underlying inflammation such as periodontitis or pyorrhea, a pocket formation, dry mouth or displacement of the marginal gums away from the tooth by mechanical (such as brushing), chemical, or surgical means. Gingival retraction, in turn, may expose the dental neck and leave it vulnerable to the action of external stimuli, and may cause root sensitivity.|$|E

40|$|THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY was {{to compare}} probing depth {{resolution}} achieved by <b>gingivectomy</b> and periodontal flap techniques {{in the treatment of}} cyclosporine A- and nifedipine-induced gingival enlargement. Ten kidney transplant patients who were receiving cyclosporine A and nifedipine for at least 6 months participated in the study. Five patients were randomly assigned to the <b>gingivectomy</b> group and 5 patients to the periodontal flap group. Only anterior segments of the oral cavity (canine to canine) were surgically treated. Clinical measurements, including probing depths, plaque index, and gingival sulcus index, were taken at baseline, 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year. Results showed that probing depths, while similar for both groups in the first 6 weeks of the study, were significantly shallower for the periodontal flap group when compared to the <b>gingivectomy</b> group at 6 months (2. 48 ± 0. 34 mm versus 4. 87 ± 0. 79 mm, respectively) and 1 year (322 ± 0. 65 mm versus 6. 40 ± 1. 02 mm, respectively).

A systemically healthy 24 -year- female patient reported with bilateral anterior gingival enlargement who was provisionally diagnosed as "gingival abscess with inflammatory enlargement" in relation to palatal aspect of the right maxillary canine to left maxillary canine. Bilateral <b>gingivectomy</b> procedure was performed by external bevel incision in relation to anterior palatal gingiva and a large wedge of epithelium and connective tissue was removed. Patient and her close acquaintances noticed a great improvement in her pronunciation and enunciation of sounds like "t", "d", "n", "l", "th", following removal of excess gingival palatal tissue and was also appreciated with visual analog scale score. Exploration of linguistic research documented the significance of tongue-palate contact during speech. Any excess gingival tissue in palatal region brings about disruption in speech by altering tongue-palate contact. Periodontal surgery like <b>gingivectomy</b> may improve disrupted phonetics. Excess gingival palatal tissue impedes on tongue-palate contact and interferes speech. Pronunciation of consonants like "t", "d", "n", "l", "th", are altered with anterior enlarged palatal gingiva.

40|$|<b>Gingivectomy,</b> a {{surgical}} gum treatment used {{to remove gum}} tissue, is applied {{for a variety of}} reasons, including the removal of diseased gum tissue and gum contouring for aesthetic purposes. While a scalpel has been previously used in this procedure, laser <b>gingivectomy</b> is now becoming common due to its decreased invasiveness, minimal bleeding, and quicker healing time. However, an entirely new set of considerations must be addressed with the introduction of lasers to the procedure. Since laser <b>gingivectomy</b> is essentially heat treatment, the heat from the laser can damage surrounding tissue and teeth. Therefore, the intensity of the laser beam must be carefully selected to prevent significant damage of teeth or non-targeted gum tissue above the incision line. A feature that helps preserve healthy tissue is the pulsed application of the laser, which prevents the exposure of the tissue to heat flux over an extended amount of time. Therefore, our goal was to model a laser <b>gingivectomy</b> process that may be used to identify the ideal laser power and pulse rate for <b>gingivectomy</b> that minimizes collateral tissue damage. To accomplish this, we created a 2 D cross-sectional model in COMSOL of the middle of a maxillary incisor with an overextending gum. The COMSOL computer software allowed us to simulate the effects of laser contouring on the gum-tooth complex. Gum geometry was simplified to a slab of constant thickness {{across the top of the}} incisor, meeting the tooth at a rounded edge. Tooth geometry was simplified to a series of rectangular slabs exhibiting constant thickness consistent with parameters gleaned from literature. Preliminary results showed little heat penetration to the extremes of our computational domain, which supports the simplification of not including the entire length of the tooth in our geometry. Material properties, such as the thermal conductivity, density, and heat capacity of gum and tooth were taken from existing literature. We considered targeted gum to be vaporized at a temperature of 100 ˚C, consistent with surface soft tissue heat treatment characteristics. Ideally, tooth and preserved gum should stay below 60 ˚C. The tooth temperature profile is considered in an optimization equation that aims to minimize unnecessary tissue damage. This temperature profile is used to determine which regions are suffering protein denaturation and experiencing vaporization. By comparing our results with previously conducted procedures involving laser treatment of gum, we found that our results were consistent with the outcomes of these processes, which used the same type of laser as the one we modeled. Noting that the simplifications and conjectures on boundary and initial conditions limit the validity of our model, our results indicated that the ideal laser peak power for a <b>gingivectomy</b> process using a CO 2 laser is 25 Watts. Our model could also be used to test the use of <b>gingivectomy</b> to dispose of diseased tissue, which likely exhibits different material properties than the healthy gum tissue we modeled. Therefore, our model can provide laser manufacturers and product trainers with crucial information that can be used to develop parameter settings for a more controlled <b>gingivectomy.</b> In this study, we model the ablation of the gum tissue and find the optimal power of the laser and pulse conditions in order to successfully ablate the tissue without causing unnecessary heat damage to the healthy tissue or the enamel of the tooth...|$|E
