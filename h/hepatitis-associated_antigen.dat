40|$|The {{usefulness}} of the Ouchterlony double-diffusion test was enhanced by modi-fication of the technique to include a 24 -hr period during which gels were pre-treated with antiserum. The modified and conventional techniques were compared for effectiveness in estimating concentration of <b>hepatitis-associated</b> (Australia) <b>antigen</b> (HAA) and for sensitivity. Only with the modified test was a linear relationship found to exist between the distance of a precipitin line from the antigen well (PA) and the logarithm of antigen concentration. Therefore, {{it was possible to}} estimate the relative concentration of HAA in serum by referring its PA in the modified test to the curve of PA versus potency for a standard preparation of antigen. In addition, the modified test was found to be eightfold more sensitive than the conventional technique, with the result that 1. 6 times as many positive sera were detected in routine screening. An important test for the diagnosis of serum hep-atitis (long-incubation period) is the detection of <b>hepatitis-associated</b> (Australia) <b>antigen</b> (HAA) in the serum of the patient [1 - 5]. The original and most popular method of assaying HAA utilizes the Ouchterlony double-diffusion technique [2, 6].

40|$|Knowledge of {{the natural}} history of long-incubation period {{hepatitis}} which has progressed at intervals since 1885 has been expanded to some extent in recent years by the results of tests for <b>hepatitis-associated</b> Australia <b>antigen</b> in the blood of patients with various forms of acute and chronic hepatitis and in apparently healthy individuals in different groups of various populations in different countries. How-ever, advances in our knowledge resulting from this recent discovery have been very small compared with the flood of papers on the subject. In the brief time at my disposal I shall attempt to assess the evidence presented so far of the commonest mode of spread in various situations, and also what un-common routes are most likely. The degree of infectiousness of the agent or agents and the possible significance of the presence of strains of virus of different infectivity and virulence will also be discussed. In retrospect, the high rate of infectivity which may occur with injection of very small amounts of blood or tissue fluids was apparent from the first known incident of probable long-incubation period hepatitis in Bremen (Liirman, 1885) when the fluid from vesicles of patients previously vaccinated against smallpox was used to vaccinate 1 289 per-sons by the scratch method; 190 of them developed hepatitis with jaundice. Subsequently groups of cases of jaundice of an apparently similar nature occurred in patients undergoing venepuncture for diagnostic blood tests in some clinics for the treat-ment of venereal disease and diabetes. In some in-stances these cases were thought to be related in some manner to catarrhal jaundice which was differentiated from leptospiral jaundice in 1916. However, the first clear indication of the presence of this newly recognized form of blood-transmitted disease occurred in 1937 in the United Kingdom and came from the results of the inoculation of (1) a large pool of adult serum for the prophylaxis of measles in children (MacNalty, 1938; Propert, 1938) and (2) the inoculation of yellow fever vaccine containing a small amount of human serum in adult...|$|R

Younger subjects and {{males were more frequently}} positive. There was no difference in the presence of anti-H. A. A. between patients and controls. Correlation of the results of serological testing with histopathological features showed that macronodular (“posthepatitic,” “postnecrotic”) types of cirrhosis, which predominate in Uganda, were associated with the presence of H.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the same transmissible viral agent may be responsible, not only for parenterally transmitted long-incubation hepatitis, but also for sporadic infectious hepatitis (1, 2). An antigen, variably described as Australia antigen (3 - 5), serum hepatitis (SH) 1 antigen (6, 7), hepatitis antigen (2), or <b>hepatitis-associated</b> <b>antigen</b> (8), appears to be a structural component of a virus-like particle (9 - 11) which fulfills the requirements for the serum hepatitis virus. This antigen, or group of antigens (12 - 14), provides a convenient marker for SH virus particles in blood (9 - 11). Agents such as the SH virus, because of their persistence and limited cytopathic effects in some individuals, possess unique pathogenetic potential beyond that of direct viralinduced tissue injury. As a persistent endogenous antigen (12), the SH virus may serve as an antigenic focus for immunologically mediated tissue injury. Alternatively, it may participate in the genesis of immune complexes and the initiation of immune complex disease (15, 16) in a fashion similar to that of certain persistent viral infections in experimental animals (17, 18). This study was initiated to demonstrate cytologic sites and patterns of S...|$|E
40|$|The <b>{{hepatitis}}-associated</b> <b>antigen</b> (HAA) (Australian antigen) {{is either}} the infective agent of viral hepatitis or a virus-related protein(l). It {{is present in}} the blood during the incubation period and early clinical course of acute viral hepatitis in adults(l, 2). The presence of the HAA in Krugman's long incubation hepatitis (MS- 2) and its absence in childhood hepatitis, epidemic hepatitis, and in short incubation hepatitis (MS- 1) indicates it is associated with the serum hepatitis virus (s) (2, 3). The antigen persists for longer periods in the blood of some patients with chronic active hepatitis(4, 5) and dialysis-associated hepatitis(6). It is frequently present in the serum of patients with Down's syndrome(7), lepromatous leprosy(8) and certain types of leukemia(7, 9 - 11). We have investigated the frequency of HAA in the sera of patients with a wide spectrum of neoplastic diseases, including primary and metastatic liver neoplasms.

40|$|A {{model for}} the study of delayed {{hypersensitivity}} to <b>hepatitis-associated</b> <b>antigen</b> (HAA) in guinea pigs was designed. Guinea pigs immunized with purified HAA plus Freund's complete adjuvant developed a positive skin reaction when they were inoculated intradermally with HAA 17 to 35 days later. This reaction is charac-terized by erythema and induration that reaches a maximum at 24 to 36 hr and then subsides over the next 48 hr. Histologic examination of the skin lesions shows an infiltrate of predominantly mononuclear cells. Heating HAA for 1 min at 37 C, 57 C, 75 C, or 98 C does not modify its activity as an immunizing or skin-reactive agent. The role of immune mechanisms in the pathogen-esis of type B (serum) viral hepatitis remains obscure at this time. Hepatitis-associated or Aus-tralia antigen (HAA) is closely related to type B hepatitis and may represent viral particles [1, 2]. Antibodies to HAA regularly appear following in-fection, show an anamnestic response following repeated exposure, and appear to be correlated with modification and prevention of the disease [3, 4]. The role of cell-mediated immunity, recognized as paramount in the pathogenesis and control of many human illnesses, remains largely undefined in hepatitis.

Younger subjects (20 - 29 years) of both sexes showed the highest rates, and a trend toward higher rates during the spring and summer was noted. History of liver disease, injections and vaccination within 12 months, acupunctures within six months, or ingestion of raw shellfish were not more prevalent among subjects with positive HAA responses.

40|$|Light and {{electron}} microscopic examinations {{were carried}} out on liver tissues from 6 renal transplant recipients who developed Australia antigen-associated hepatitis, referred to in this paper as <b>hepatitis-associated</b> <b>antigen</b> (HAA) hepatitis. While under immunosuppressive therapy, the patients showed rapid progression of acute hepatitis to chronic active hepatitis and posthepatitic cirrhosis resulting in liver failure. By electron microscopy, in 5 of 6 patients, characteristic virus-like particles of 230 Å size were observed in massive numbers in the nucleus and occasionally in the cytoplasm of liver cells. No similar particles were found in liver biopsies from other patients. These particles had an appearance of nucleocapsid without an outer coat, and {{were believed to be}} the viruses in their natural infective states. The predominantly intranuclear location of the particles and the associated nuclear changes suggested that the nucleus is the primary site of virus replication. The finding of the virus-like particles is believed to be diagnostic for HAA hepatitis. While HAA is implicated in serum hepatitis, the identification of HAA with the virus-like particles of this study is still to be established. In the phagosomes, there were some particles showing an outer membrane and a tail-like structure. Both the coated and the noncoated particles were believed to be the same virus. The phagosomes also contained what appeared to be “degradated” viral material. The lysosomal activity in the infected hepatitic cells seemed to be increased.

Am J Pathol 64 : 483 - 500, 1971) liver biopsies of renal transplant patients who developed chronic progressive viral hepatitis associated with persistence of Australia antigenemia [Au(1) ] while under immunosuppressive therapy were studied. Predominantly intranuclear 210 - 250 A spherical, virus-like particles were revealed in 12 of 13 biopsies examined by electron microscope. No such particles {{were found in}} biopsies from Australia antigen negative patients. To investigate the relationship of these virus-like particles to Australia antigen, 2 of the Au(1) hepatitis renal transplant patients were restudied 6 to 8 months later. Liver biopsy material was prepared for light microscopy, immunofluorescent microscopy, electron microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy. The specificity of the anti-Au(1) serum {{used in this study}} was ascertained by immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis, and by immunoelectron microscopic studies of the antigen-antibody complex prepared in vitro by mixing the ferritin-conjugated anti-Au(1) reagent with the purified Au(1) particles. Electron microscopy of biopsies from liver not treated with antibody showed that virus-like particles persisted in liver cells. Immunofluorescent microscopy of teased liver biopsy suspensions showed nuclear and some cytoplasmic fluorescence, indicating the cellular localization of Au(1). The immunoelectron microscopic preparations showed agglutination of the virus-like particles and the presence of antibody coupled ferritin in the intranuclear and cytoplasmic particle agglutinates. No virus-like particles were seen in the biopsy from a control patient without Au(1) antigenemia, and results of the immunoelectron microscopic procedure were negative. Our observations that massive amounts of Au(1) -associated particles are located in liver cell nuclei of individuals with chronic active hepatitis strengthen the hypothesis of Blumberg et al that Au(1) is an infectious agent and/or the antigenic determinant of a hepatitis virus...|$|E
40|$|In a {{significant}} percentage of examined cases of fulminant hepatitis, subacute hepatitis, chronic aggressive hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and chronic persistent hepatitis, Australia (<b>hepatitis-associated)</b> <b>antigen</b> (Au HAA) was identified in the liver and in extrahepatic locations. The several immunofluorescent patterns of Au HAA localization in hepatocytes strongly suggested various stages of Au HAA accumulation and release. Deposits of a mixture of immunoglobulins G and M and occasionally β 1 C-globulin were found in the cytoplasm of Au HAA containing hepatocytes, on their plasma membranes, on or in the nuclei, in the cytoplasm of Kupffer cells and, rarely, in the sinusoids. The accompanying tissue changes were hepatocellular degeneration and necrosis. These intra- and extracellular complexes of Au HAA and immunoglobulins displayed strong affinity for guinea pig complement in the immunohistochemical complement fixation reaction. When tested by immunodiffusion in agar, IgG dissociated from these complexes by potassium thiocyanate (KSCN) treatment showed anti-Au HAA specificity. In fulminant hepatitis neither Au HAA nor immunoglobulins and complement were found in the liver. In chronic aggressive hepatitis and subacute hepatitis the amount of the Au HAA immune complexes identified in the liver was approximately inversely proportional to the extent and severity of the parenchymal lesions. In liver cirrhosis and chronic persistent hepatitis there was a positive correlation between the amount of the Au HAA immune complexes found in the liver and the degree of hepatocellular damage. The deposits of Au HAA, identified in extrahepatic locations including germinal centers of lymph nodes and spleen, kidney glomeruli and blood vessel walls, were as a rule accompanied by deposits of IgG, IgM, β 1 C-globulin and fibrin. All these deposits showed strong affinity for guinea pig complement in the immunohistochemical reaction of complement fixation. Germinal center activation, chronic membraneous glomerulonephritis, panarteritis and simple arteriolar hyalinosis were found at sites of localization of these deposits...|$|E
40|$|Serums from 55 {{patients}} with primary hepatocellular carcinoma were examined {{for the presence}} of <b>hepatitis-associated</b> <b>antigen</b> (HAA). Forty-four (80 %) had the antigen in their serums; alpha fetoglobulins were detected in 32 of 55 serums analyzed (58 %). One hundred and thirty-eight of 943 (14. 6 %) healthy Chinese control subjects with normal serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase activity had HAA in their serums. There was no apparent correlation between the presence of alpha fetoglobulins and HAA positivity in {{patients with}} hepatocellular carcinoma. SINCE THE DISCOVERY of the Australia antigen by Blumberg, Alter, and Visnich in 1965 (1), its close relationship with long-incubation viral hepatitis has been generally accepted. The antigen is now con-sidered {{an integral part of the}} virus particle (2), and the term "hepatitis-associated antigen " (HAA) has thus developed (3). Most adults with viral hepatitis in the United States have a transiently detectable HAA titer in their serums during the early stages of the disease (3); it disappears as most patients achieve complete clinical recovery. In a small number of patients the antigen persists after the acute phase of viral hepa-titis, either unassociated with symptoms (unresolved (4 - 6) or persistent hepatitis (7, 8)) or with the development of chronic liver disease (chronic active viral hepatitis (9, 10) or chronic aggressive hepatitis (8)). A high incidence of liver disease, especially viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, and primary liver carcinoma, is found among inhabitants of Taiwan (11, 12). Since the agent that causes viral hepatitis may be asso-ciated with the progression from hepatitis to cirrhosis, it may also play a role in the development of hepato-cellular carcinoma (13). This report details the prevalence of HAA in patients with primary hepato-cellular carcinoma in Taiwan...|$|E
