5|$|The third highest-grossing film of its decade, Mom and <b>Dad</b> <b>was</b> {{claimed by}} Babb {{to have made}} $63,000 for every $1,000 the {{original}} investors contributed, and the Los Angeles Times estimated that it grossed anywhere from $40 million to $100 million.

5|$|Though {{the role}} {{is subject to}} many stereotypes, and men may have {{difficulties}} accessing parenting benefits, communities, and services targeted at mothers, it became more socially acceptable by the 2000s. The stay-at-home <b>dad</b> <b>was</b> more regularly portrayed in the media by the 2000s, especially in the United States. However, due to traditional family structures and stereotypic expectations, the stay at home father figure is culturally unacceptable in countries in South Asia such as India.|$|E

25|$|My <b>dad</b> <b>was</b> not {{the monster}} my lying brother said he was; he was strict, {{but my father}} never beat us black and blue, and my brother Gary was a vicious, no-good liar for saying so. I have nothing but fond {{memories}} of Dad, going to studios with him, family vacations at our cabin in Idaho, boating and fishing with him. To my dying day, I'll hate Gary for dragging Dad's name through the mud. He wrote Going My Own Way out of greed. He wanted to make money and knew that humiliating our father and blackening his name {{was the only way}} he could do it. He knew it would generate a lot of publicity. That was {{the only way he could}} get his ugly, no-talent face on television and in the newspapers. My <b>dad</b> <b>was</b> my hero. I loved him very much. He loved all of us too, including Gary. He was a great father.|$|E

500|$|One of my very {{greatest}} fears as a {{child was}} being ridiculed in public. And there it was coming true. As a television presenter, I'd been respected. People {{come up to you}} in the street and shake your hand and talk to you in a respectful way. And suddenly, overnight, this was transformed into [...] "Icke's a nutter."

500|$|While MacFarlane {{regularly}} does extensive voice acting {{work for}} American Dad!, {{he has left}} much of the show's creative direction up to Weitzman and Barker. MacFarlane has credited this move with helping to give the series its own distinct voice and identity. Though, as announced on November 4, 2013, Barker departed American Dad! after 10 seasons of serving as the show's producer/co-showrunner, resulting from creative differences as production for season 11 on TBS commenced. American <b>Dad!</b> <b>was</b> first shown after Super Bowl XXXIX, debuting with the episode [...] "Pilot." [...] This February 6, 2005 series premiere was somewhat of an early sneak preview as the program would not begin airing regularly as part of Fox's Animation Domination until May 1, 2005.|$|E
500|$|The single [...] "Undone - The Sweater Song" [...] was {{described}} by Cuomo as [...] "the feeling you get when the train stops and the little guy comes knockin' on your door.

[...] The video marks one of the early directorial efforts of Spike Jonze, whose pitch was simply [...] "A blue stage, a steadicam, a pack of wild dogs." [...] The video became an instant hit on MTV. [...] The final single, [...] "Say it Ain't So", was again inspired by Cuomo believing his parents split up when he was four because he thought his <b>dad</b> <b>was</b> an alcoholic. The music video, which was directed by Sophie Muller, was less successful than the previous Spike Jonze-directed video. It featured the band performing in the garage of their former house, and the bandmates playing hacky sack in the backyard.|$|E
500|$|During {{the sixth}} season the {{development}} of the character was praised, Glenn Diaz of BuddyTV commented that [...] "You gotta love Mer when she's gloomy.", in addition to praising Pompeo's performance.

Three seasons ago Meredith would never have dreamed of putting Lexie first, and I was proud of her for giving up part of her liver—her offer to get to know her <b>dad</b> <b>was</b> an even bigger milestone." [...] Reviewing {{the first part of the}} eighth season, TV Fanatic lauded the character and wrote: [...] "this season belongs to Meredith Grey. She is the heart and soul of the show and has been outstanding. This is a character that used to be so dark and twisty and has now grown into a more mature woman.

500|$|The {{brothers}} {{first became}} interested in wrestling in their youth by watching the World Wrestling Federation {{on one of the}} two channels their television could receive. Originally, they practiced wrestling moves with one another on a trampoline before the family built a wrestling ring in their backyard. From the beginning, the two of them worked on honing their craft, taping their moves and trying to improve them. Despite the fact that their <b>dad</b> <b>was</b> a coach for their high school's wrestling team, they did not participate in amateur wrestling in their high school years. Their first foray into professional wrestling came with the East Coast Wrestling Association (ECWA), while they were still in high school. While their mother, Jana, was in line to purchase tickets to attend a wrestling event, a promoter for the ECWA approached her and asked if her sons had a tape of themselves wrestling. This led to the brothers debuting for ECWA on May 20, 2000 under the ring names [...] "Jay and Mark Briscoe".|$|E

Rootes remarked: [...] "When I was frowing up, my <b>dad</b> <b>was</b> really violent. I knew it was something I had to write a song about – {{to get it out}} of my system." [...] The song inspired the album cover, which depicts a cat holding a mouse in its jaw. Rootes explained that the mouse's black eye represents a moment of serenity before it dies. Similarly, the song [...] "Scream" [...] deals with rape issues, while [...] "Dirty Old Bird" [...] is about spousal abuse. The track [...] "Technicolour Yawn" [...] is about the unpleasant effect of a hangover, [...] "Psychofudge" [...] is about drug usage, and [...] "Cheap" [...] deals with one's loss of virginity and the subsequent feel of becoming [...] "sort of cheap and common." ...|$|E
