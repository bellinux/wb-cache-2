Maldacena's results also provided a concrete realization of the <b>holographic</b> <b>principle</b> with important implications for quantum gravity and black hole physics. By the year 2015, Maldacena's paper had become the most highly cited paper in high energy physics with over 10,000 citations.

25|$|The <b>holographic</b> <b>principle</b> was {{inspired}} by black hole thermodynamics, which conjectures that the maximal entropy in any region scales with the radius squared, and not cubed as might be expected. In {{the case of a}} black hole, the insight was that the informational content of all the objects that have fallen into the hole might be entirely contained in surface fluctuations of the event horizon.

Here, we developed a versatile plasmonic metalens, a metasurface comprised of coupled subwavelength resonators, whose optical responses exhibit a remarkable feature of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). We demonstrate numerically and experimentally how a proper spatial design of the unit elements steers SPs to arbitrary foci based on the <b>holographic</b> <b>principles.</b> More specifically, we show how to control the interaction between the constituent EIT resonators to efficiently manipulate the focusing intensity of SPs.

25|$|In {{some recent}} {{developments}} of theoretical physics {{stemming from the}} <b>holographic</b> <b>principle,</b> the Universe is seen fundamentally as an information store, essentially zeroes and ones, organized in much less geometrical fashion and manifesting itself as space-time and particle fields only on a more superficial level.

25|$|The <b>holographic</b> <b>{{principle}}</b> is {{a principle}} of string theories and a supposed property of quantum gravity that states that the description of a volume of space {{can be thought of}} as encoded on a lower-dimensional boundary to the region—preferably a light-like boundary like a gravitational horizon. First proposed by Gerard 't Hooft, it was given a precise string-theory interpretation by Leonard Susskind who combined his ideas with previous ones of 't Hooft and Charles Thorn.

The phenomenal success of the audio CD on the eager worldwide marketplace has encouraged rapid development of CD technology and spawned entirely new high tech applications for the dimpled disc. The Mini Disc (MD), for instance, occupies about one-fourth the area of the standard CD-Digital Audio (CD-DA) format yet provides an identical playing time through efficient data reduction.

40|$|<b>Holographic</b> <b>principles</b> have {{impacted}} {{the way we}} look at {{strong coupling}} phenomena in quantum chromodynamics, strongly interacting extensions of the standard model, and {condensed-matter} physics. In real world settings, however, we still lack understanding of why and when such an approach is justified. Therefore, here, without invoking any such principle a priori, we demonstrate how such a picture arises in the worldline formulation of quantum field theory. Among other connections to holographic models, a warped AdS 5 geometry, a quantum mechanical picture, and hidden local symmetry emerge, {{as well as a}} Wilson flow (gradient flow), which extends the four-dimensional sources to five-dimensional fields and a link to the Gutzwiller trace formula.

25|$|For a given {{energy in}} a given volume, there is an upper limit to the density of {{information}} (the Bekenstein bound) about the whereabouts of all the particles which compose matter in that volume, suggesting that matter itself cannot be subdivided infinitely many times and {{there must be an}} ultimate level of fundamental particles. As the degrees of freedom of a particle are the product of all the degrees of freedom of its sub-particles, were a particle to have infinite subdivisions into lower-level particles, the degrees of freedom of the original particle would be infinite, violating the maximal limit of entropy density. The <b>holographic</b> <b>principle</b> thus implies that the subdivisions must stop at some level, and that the fundamental particle is a bit (1 or 0) of information.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, Joseph Polchinski {{discovered}} that the theory requires higher-dimensional objects, called D-branes and identified these with the black-hole solutions of supergravity. These were understood {{to be the new}} objects suggested by the perturbative divergences, and they opened up a new field with rich mathematical structure. It quickly became clear that D-branes and other p-branes, not just strings, formed the matter content of the string theories, and the physical interpretation of the strings and branes was revealed—they are a type of black hole. Leonard Susskind had incorporated the <b>holographic</b> <b>principle</b> of Gerardus 't Hooft into string theory, identifying the long highly excited string states with ordinary thermal black hole states. As suggested by 't Hooft, the fluctuations of the black hole horizon, the world-sheet or world-volume theory, describes not only the degrees of freedom of the black hole, but all nearby objects too.|$|E
25|$|During this period, Tom Banks, Willy Fischler, Stephen Shenker and Leonard Susskind {{formulated}} matrix theory, a full holographic {{description of}} M-theory using IIA D0 branes. This {{was the first}} definition of string theory that was fully non-perturbative and a concrete mathematical realization of the <b>holographic</b> <b>principle.</b> It {{is an example of}} a gauge-gravity duality and is now understood to be a special case of the AdS/CFT correspondence. Andrew Strominger and Cumrun Vafa calculated the entropy of certain configurations of D-branes and found agreement with the semi-classical answer for extreme charged black holes. Petr Hořava and Witten found the eleven-dimensional formulation of the heterotic string theories, showing that orbifolds solve the chirality problem. Witten noted that the effective description of the physics of D-branes at low energies is by a supersymmetric gauge theory, and found geometrical interpretations of mathematical structures in gauge theory that he and Nathan Seiberg had earlier discovered in terms of the location of the branes.|$|E
40|$|Holography {{is a novel}} {{approach}} to modeling strongly interacting many-body systems. By reorganizing the quantum many-body problem into an equivalent problem in classical gravity, holography makes it relatively easy, for example, to study linear response and compute transport coefficients. These techniques have recently been used to build toy models of superconductivity known as "Holographic Superconductors". In this thesis, we will be applying these same <b>holographic</b> <b>principles</b> to a strongly-interacting superconducting system in which multiple condensates compete. In the gravitational description, our system begins with two non-interacting Abelian Higgs multiplets, each comprised of a vector and a charged scalar. This describes a system with two independent condensates. Coupling the scalars via a quartic interaction induces a competition between the two condensates, with a condensate of one operator suppressing or enhancing the other depending on {{the sign of the}} coupling. by Dorota M.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is focused}} on three lines of work. In the first part, we consider aspects of holography and gauge/gravity duality in lower and higher dimensions. In particular, we study the duality for exact solutions localized on the Randal-Sundrum 2 -branes. We also test if some <b>holographic</b> <b>principles</b> in general relativity can be generalized to include higher derivative theories of gravity; namely Lovelock gravity. In the second part we consider the role of pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons (pNGBs) in inflationary cosmology. Specifically, we construct an inflationary model using string theory axions, and use these pNGBs to produce the observed coherent magnetic field in the Universe. The third part of the thesis {{is devoted to the}} study of the phenomenology of emergent phenomena. We investigated whether one could test if diffeomorphism invariance, the sacred symmetry of general relativity, is emergent. We also construct a new minimal vectorial Standard Model, and argue that the absence of mirror particles predicted by this model can give us a hint about the fundamental nature of space. ...|$|R
25|$|In 1997, Juan Maldacena {{noted that}} the low energy {{excitations}} of a theory near a black hole consist of objects close to the horizon, which for extreme charged black holes looks like an anti-de Sitter space. He noted that in this limit the gauge theory describes the string excitations near the branes. So he hypothesized that string theory on a near-horizon extreme-charged black-hole geometry, an anti-de Sitter space times a sphere with flux, is equally well described by the low-energy limiting gauge theory, the N = 4 supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory. This hypothesis, which is called the AdS/CFT correspondence, was further developed by Steven Gubser, Igor Klebanov and Alexander Polyakov, and by Edward Witten, {{and it is now}} well-accepted. It is a concrete realization of the <b>holographic</b> <b>principle,</b> which has far-reaching implications for black holes, locality and information in physics, as well as the nature of the gravitational interaction.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} mathematical {{and empirical}} {{results on the}} behavior of a new multidi-mensional neural computing paradigm called multidimensional holographic associative com-puting (MHAC). MHAC can be potentially used for high density associative storage and retrieval ofimage information. Unlike conventional neural computing, each morsel ofinformation in MHAC is represented as a complex vector in a multidimensional unit spherical space. Each ofthe individual phases of the vector enumerates a value of the information. The magnitude of the vector represents the associated confidence in the information. In contrast, the conventional neural computing operates only on the notion of confidence. The proposed multidimensional generalization demonstrates significant improvement in associative storage capacity without the loss of generalization space. Virtually, unlimited pattern associations can be enfolded over a single holographic memory substrate by higher order encoding. In addition, its well-structured computation, simultaneous muti-channel learning, and single step non-iterative retrieval promise highly scalable parallelism. The paper presents the theory ofoperation ofMHAC that is founded on the generalized <b>holographic</b> <b>principles</b> and multidimensional Hebbian learning. The paper also presents analytical as well as empirical evidence from computer simulation supporting the superior performance of MHAC cells. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{analyses}} three beam shaping approaches {{with respect to}} a light-efficient generation of i) patterns and ii) multiple spots by means of a generic optical 4 f-setup. 4 f approaches share the property that due to the one-to-one relationship between output intensity and input phase, the need for time-consuming, iterative calculation can be avoided. The resulting low computational complexity offers a particular advantage compared to the widely used <b>holographic</b> <b>principles</b> and makes them potential candidates for real-time applications. The increasing availability of high-speed phase modulators, e. g. on the basis of MEMS, calls for an evaluation of the performances of these concepts. Our second interest is the applicability of 4 f methods to high-power applications. We discuss the variants of 4 f intensity shaping by phase modulation from a system-level point of view which requires the consideration of application relevant boundary conditions. The discussion includes i) the micro mirror based phase manipulation combined with amplitude masking in the Fourier plane, ii) the Generalized Phase Contrast, and iii) matched phase-only correlation filtering combined with GPC. The conceptual comparison relies on comparative figures of merit for energy efficiency, pattern homogeneity, pattern image quality, maximum output intensity and flexibility with respect to the displayable pattern.

40|$|This thesis {{records the}} {{theoretical}} analysis and hardware {{development of a}} laboratory microwave imaging system which uses <b>holographic</b> <b>principles.</b> The application of an aperture synthesis technique and the electronic commutation of all antennae {{has resulted in a}} compact and economic assembly - which requires no moving parts and which, consequently, has a high field mapping speed potential. The relationship of this microwave holographic system to other established techniques is examined theoretically and the performance of the imaging system is demonstrated using conventional optically- and numerically-based reconstruction of the measured holograms. The high mapping speed potential of this system has allowed the exploitation of an imaging mode not usually associated with microwave holography. In particular, a certain antenna array specification leads to a versatile imaging system which corresponds closely in the laboratory scale to the widely used synthetic aperture radar principle. It is envisaged that the microwave holographic implementation of this latter principle be used as laboratory instrumentation in the elucidation of the interaction of hydrodynamic and electromagnetic waves. Some simple demonstrations of this application have been presented, and the concluding chapter also describes a suitable hardware specification. This thesis has also emphasised the hardware details of the imaging system since the development of the microwave and other electronic components represented a substantial part of this research and because the potential applications of the imaging principle {{have been found to be}} intimately linked to the tolerances of the various microwave components.

40|$|Antennas {{based on}} <b>holographic</b> <b>principles</b> are {{attractive}} at millimetre wave frequencies {{because of their}} potentially relatively high directivity and low profile. Most published design work on planar holographic antennas {{has been based on}} approximate expressions and experimental experience. Little attempt appears to have made to use some computational electromagnetics approach to model these antennas. Thus no numerical optimization has been possible. One aspect that makes the modeling/optimization process difficult is that such planar holographic antennas are electrically large. For instance, {{in the case of a}} holographic antenna of directivity 18 dBi, the combined length of the conducting strips on the antennas can be more than 100 lambda 0. In this thesis we formulate and implement a two-dimensional electromagnetic analysis that allows one to determine the H-plane radiation characteristics of the holographic antenna. This analysis consists of an integral equation formulation for a line source illuminating a structure consisting of conducting strips and dielectric material, plus feedhorn walls, and its solution using the method of moments. We demonstrate how it can be applied in the modeling of the holographic antennas in question. It is possible to model the holographic antenna's feedhorn, the holographic antenna proper, and its interaction with the feedhorn. In addition, we have integrated the electromagnetic analysis with numerical optimization algorithms, and show what antenna geometries (such as the distribution of conducting strip widths) are obtruded by such algorithms as being optimum in some sense. Experimental validation is provided, and shows that it is possible to improve the gain of the holographic antenna by up to roughly 2 dB...|$|R
