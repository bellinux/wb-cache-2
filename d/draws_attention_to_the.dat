5|$|Cotton Mather, in his 1693 book The Wonders of the Invisible World, {{concerning}} the Salem Witch Trials, specifically <b>draws</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Suffolk trial, and the Salem judge stated that although spectral evidence {{should be allowed}} in order to begin investigations, {{it should not be}} admitted as evidence to decide a case.|$|E
5|$|La Grange <b>draws</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> notably high tessitura for the sopranos, for soloists and for choral singers. He characterises the alto solos as {{brief and}} unremarkable; however, the tenor solo role in PartII is both {{extensive}} and demanding, requiring {{on several occasions}} {{to be heard over}} the choruses. The wide melodic leaps in the Pater Profundus role present particular challenges to the bass soloist.|$|E
5|$|The sitters are {{presented}} in three-quarter view before flat, nondescript lacquer-like green backgrounds, which although lushly coloured, are thinly layered. Each has a white ground and light red imprimatura with lead content. The sitter's form and pose echo {{and in many ways}} counterbalance each other. Brand Philip <b>draws</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> similarities of the panels' linear construction, especially {{the manner in which the}} folds and lines of their clothing form triangular shapes. The train of Barbara's headdress across her chest corresponds with the opening of Albrecht's fur-lined coat. It was more usual in pendant portraits of this type for the male to be on the left-hand side; the positioning here may be an indication that Dürer originally intended his father's panel to stand alone, given that Barbara's was painted some time later.|$|E

25|$|Besides {{the ability}} to drive the {{predator}} away, mobbing also <b>draws</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> predator, making stealth attacks impossible. Mobbing plays {{a critical role in}} the identification of predators and inter-generational learning about predator identification. Reintroduction of species is often unsuccessful, because the established population lacks this cultural knowledge of how to identify local predators. Scientists are exploring ways to train populations to identify and respond to predators before releasing them into the wild.|$|E
25|$|Hahn {{encourages}} {{the viewer to}} think deeper, not only {{through the use of}} different physical processes in her artwork, but also through the multiplicity of meanings in her photographs. In most of her work, Hahn integrates humor and irony as she explores the meanings generated by formal combinations. Some of her prints include the sprocket holes of the 35mm negative, which allude to its 35mm film origins: but by hand coloring with bright paints, she <b>draws</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mixture of craft with industrial mediums.|$|E
25|$|Professor Dale Scott {{alleges that}} the entire {{movement}} was designed to allow for Suharto's response. He <b>draws</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact the side of Lapangan Merdeka on which KOSTRAD was situated was not occupied, and that only those generals who might have prevented Suharto seizing power (except Nasution) were kidnapped. Scott also discusses the relationship between Suharto {{and three of the}} Army battalions involved in the coup, which were under his command and staffed by US-trained soldiers. He notes that these battalions switched sides during the rebellion, working to both instigate and quell the coup.|$|E

25|$|A recent {{alternative}} {{interpretation of}} Patrick's departure to Ireland suggests {{that as the}} son of a decurion he would have been obliged by Roman law to serve on the town council (curia), but chose instead to abscond from the onerous obligations of this office by fleeing abroad, as many others in his position had done in what has become known as the 'flight of the curiales'. However, according to Patrick's own account, it was the raiders who brought him to Ireland where he was enslaved and held captive for six years. Roy Flechner also asserts the improbability of an escape from servitude and journey of the kind that Patrick purports to have undertaken. He also <b>draws</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> biblical allusions in Patrick's own account (e.g. the topos of freedom after six years of servitude in Exod. 21:2 or Jer. 34:14), which imply that perhaps parts of the account may not have been intended to be understood literally.|$|E
500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review for AllMusic, Richie Unterberger <b>draws</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> album's [...] "gentle, fairy-tale ambience", with songs that move from [...] "concise and vivid" [...] to [...] "spacy, ethereal material with lengthy instrumental passages". In a review for BBC Music, Daryl Easlea said Saucerful was [...] "not without filler", adding that [...] "Jugband Blues" [...] was [...] "the most chilling" [...] {{song on the}} album.|$|E
500|$|Though {{he shows}} concern for verisimilitude—particularly in {{the immediacy of}} the {{abortion}} scene—Barth at times <b>draws</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> artifice of the writing. [...] Jake recounts long conversations with Rennie or Joe that he points out never occurred as written—he has ordered and condensed their content. [...] Jake also expresses a belief that was to manifest itself in Barth's later approach to writing: [...] "To turn experience into speech, that is, to classify, to conceptualize, to grammarize, to syntactify it—is always a betrayal of it, a falsification of it".|$|E

500|$|Erica Sheen and Annette Davison, {{in their}} book The Cinema of David Lynch: American Dreams, Nightmare Visions, have drawn {{attention}} {{to the use of}} mise en scène early in the episode. A scene featuring Ferguson, Leland and Sarah Palmer sitting in the Palmers' living room pans across the family's [...] "bric-à-brac". This technique <b>draws</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> painting with which Ferguson will be assaulted, and it highlights the similarity between Ferguson and Palmer by focusing on [...] "the famous homecoming queen shot" [...] of Palmer while Ferguson's face is visible. Sheen and Davison argued that the scene highlights the [...] "emotional claustrophobia" [...] felt by Ferguson, and that the set surrounding her was deliberately assembled to create this feeling.|$|E
500|$|Harry Thompson {{stated that}} the Secrets of the Unicorn-Red Rackham's Treasure arc marked the {{beginning}} of the third and central stage of [...] "Tintin's career". He furthermore stated that in these two stories, Tintin has been converted from a reporter into an explorer to cope with the new political climate. He stated that in this story, Hergé [...] "abandons the complex plotting of The Secret of the Unicorn in favour of an episodic style of adventure not seen since the early books". Thompson further <b>draws</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> arrival of Calculus in the story, describing him as the [...] "third and final member" [...] of Tintin's [...] "family". Thompson was critical of the use of colour in the story, stating that much of it looks better in black-and-white, as it was originally printed in Le Soir.|$|E
500|$|Truth or Square {{received}} generally mixed critical {{response from}} critics and fans, and was criticized mainly {{due to the}} [...] "Patchy the Pirate" [...] segments. Paul Mavis from DVD Talk said [...] "Truth or Square is a strange mix of some truly memorable animated SpongeBob moments interrupted unfortunately by the largely unfunny Patchy the Pirate segments." [...] He added [...] "All of those amusing moments in Truth or Square, along with the A Charlie Brown Christmas ending, make one forget the patchy Patchy segments in Truth or Square." [...] Roy Hrab of DVD Verdict gave the episode a negative review saying [...] "Wow... This is without a doubt the lamest SpongeBob episode I have ever seen In fact, nothing interesting happens at all. The Patchy interludes and reliance on cameos merely <b>draws</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> episode's lack of substance." ...|$|E

500|$|The company touted Cosby's {{education}} and rapport with adults and children. The campaign {{was aimed at}} parents, rather than children, as was the campaign for the Commodore 64. [...] Cosby was {{the face of a}} mystery rebate program, offering reimbursements of between $3 and $1,000. J. Fred Bucy, who was head of Texas Instruments' home computer operation in 1983, scrapped Cosby's advertisements to focus on the product's educational value. Radio Shack vice-president of marketing David Beckerman said, [...] "A celebrity <b>draws</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> product. Even if we had President Reagan on our ads, we wouldn't sell any more computers. A product sells itself. A celebrity causes indirect sales." [...] Cosby, along with entrepreneur James Bruce Llewellyn, bought stock in a Philadelphia Coca-Cola bottler in 1983 as part of the company's push to increase African American participation in the company. This was, in part, a response to pressure by Jesse Jackson's PUSH campaign.|$|E
500|$|Parker {{also said}} he and Stone {{purposely}} wrote the episode to present Jesus as the hero from a [...] "humanist approach"; Clasquin said this is demonstrated {{by the fact that}} Jesus becomes caught up in people's expectations for the fight and becomes offended when people bet against him: [...] "This satirical gesture beautifully <b>draws</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sheer humanity of Jesus. He really is a man, just as we are men and women. He is open to fear and uncertainty." [...] Several writers said the episode also lampooned the way Americans can turn anything, even a religious situation, into a commercially hyped event. Matt Zoller Seitz of The Star-Ledger said: [...] "They aren't making fun of organized religion (though they have in the past). They're making fun of those who would turn religion into entertainment and entertainment into a kind of religion." [...] Seitz said the episode mocks [...] "morality cops who misbehave in private" [...] like Priest Maxi, who secretly bets the parish against Jesus even as he admonished congregation members for siding with Satan.|$|E
500|$|Sheeran {{believes}} that Peake's creativity waned into conservatism, his talent [...] "dampened by mass production". He describes Peake's Cambridge portrait, Prince Charles, as Duke of York as poorly drawn, with a lifeless pose, in a stereotyped composition that [...] "confirms the artist's reliance {{on a much}} repeated formula in his later years". Art historian and curator Karen Hearn, on the other hand, praises the work as [...] "magnificent" [...] and <b>draws</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> naturalistically rendered note pinned to the curtain. Peake painted the portrait to mark Charles’s visit to Cambridge on 3 and 4 March 1613, during which he was awarded an M.A.—four months {{after the death of}} his brother. Depicting Prince Charles wearing the Garter and Lesser George, Peake here reverts to a more formal, traditional style of portraiture. The note pinned to a curtain of cloth of gold, painted in trompe-l'œil fashion, commemorates Charles’s visit in Latin. X-rays of the portrait reveal that Peake painted it over another portrait. Pentimenti, or signs of alteration, can be detected: for example, Charles’s right hand originally rested on his waist.|$|E
