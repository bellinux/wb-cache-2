Left: Four small responders (A, B, C, D) are mounted in the corners of the trawl net opening and wired via junction bottle (E) and umbilical (F) to a surface station computer. Center: The net is deployed. Right: The surface station computer sends instructions to one responder (ex. A) to transmit, while instructing the other responders (ex. B, C, D) to receive. By this method all six distances (A-B, A-C, A-D, B-C, B-D, C-D) are measured. The four sides of the opening and one diagonal are used to triangulate the trawl net opening geometry and area. The second diagonal is available to compute a measurement error metric for data quality verification.|$|E

40|$|In {{assessment}} {{and management of}} marine fish resources, representative data of statistically good quality describing the actual catch are lacking for many fisheries. Even for the most studied fisheries in the north Atlantic, the uncertainty regarding what is actually caught has implications for management. <b>Fish</b> <b>stock</b> <b>assessments</b> and sound advice in most cases rely on representative samples of catches. Distant and high sea fisheries often suffer from poor sampling due to sampling personal logistics. Consequently, <b>stock</b> <b>assessment</b> and management of marine fish resources exploited by those fisheries are based on poor or scarce catch data. Presently, sampling at sea are often random in time and place, and not necessarily representative {{with respect to the}} fleet metier. Biological sampling in distant waters is a challenge due to logistics and high costs. The use of electronic scales onboard commercial fishing vessels opens for a new approach in data collection. In recent years electronic scales measuring individual fish weights on deck have been connected to GPS in combination with data on depth, fishing gear, logbook information etc. This approach will link detailed data to auxiliary information on the fishery, thereby meet the challenges of obtaining representative fishery data, continuous and full sampling providing a sufficient data basis for <b>fish</b> <b>stock</b> <b>assessments</b> and subsequent fisheries management for species found in distant waters...|$|R

Mybodyofworkhas been inplankton research to support fisheries assessments, and in ecosystemsprogrammedevelopment and implementation. I describe my early studies on Pacific plankton oceanography {{in relation to}} fisheries assessment, and subsequent studies of plankton oceanography fisheries in relation to coastal ocean fisheries and management. Early in my career, realizing that applications of my pub-lished results {{and those of other}} fisheries ecologistswere generally not included in <b>fish</b> <b>stock</b> <b>assessments,</b> I participated in a national planning group that introduced a system for marine resources monitoring, assessment, and prediction (MARMAP) that included primary productivity, ichthyo-plankton, zooplankton, and oceanographic assessments as important components for large-scale fisheries ecology assessment. I joined with European colleagues in ICES to advance fisheries ecology studies in <b>fish</b> <b>stock</b> <b>assessments</b> in the 1970 s and 1980 s. In 1983, I conceived with Professor Lewis Alexander of the University of Rhode Island a system for assessing and managing marine resources within the spatial domain of ecologically delineated large marine ecosystems (LMEs). On behalf of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and in partnership withdeveloping countries, international financial organizations,UNagencies, andNGOs, I amcurrently contributing scientific and technical advice to a global network of assessment and management projects in 22 LMEs with 110 developing countries and $ 3. 1 billion in financial support.

However, a generalized linear mixed-effects model gave very reliable results over a wide range of spatial variations in densities and we recommend it for the analysis of paired-tow survey calibration data.

The {{international}} {{council for}} {{the exploration of}} the seas (ICES) publish annual reports on <b>fish</b> <b>stock</b> <b>assessments.</b> Based on the <b>stock</b> <b>assessment</b> data for the North-East Arctic cod we estimate the effective fishing mortality, establishing coefficients for the catchability-at-age and the annual fishing effort.

Furthermore, we estimate stock-recruitment relationships of the North-East Arctic cod. The recruitment is influenced by climatic conditions at the time of spawning, and we incorporate this by controlling the sea temperature in the stock-recruitment relationship, and found that the stock-recruitment was increasing in the sea temperature at the time of spawning. These and other features will be used in analysis of how climate change affect the stock, the implications for the fisheries with respect to sharing of the stock between Russia and Norway, and the socio-economic consequences of climate change on communities and industry...|$|R
