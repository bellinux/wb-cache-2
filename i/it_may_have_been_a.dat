5|$|A Polish Nobleman is a 1637 {{painting}} by Rembrandt depicting {{a man in}} a costume of either Polish szlachta or boyar nobility. The identity of the subject of the painting is unclear, and has given rise to several different interpretations. The view that the figure's dress is clearly Polish is not universally held and <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> self-portrait.|$|E
5|$|Edinburgh was {{formally}} {{established as a}} royal burgh by King David I of Scotland around 1125. This gave the town the privilege of holding a market, {{and the ability to}} raise money by taxing goods coming into the burgh for sale. It is probable, therefore, that some form of boundary was constructed around this time, although <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> timber palisade or ditch, rather than a stone wall.|$|E
5|$|From Saxon {{times it}} was part of the hundred of Hayridge. From 1894 to 1935 {{it was part of}} Tiverton Rural District and prior to that it was part of Tiverton Sanitary District and Tiverton Poor Law Union. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> borough in the 17th century but this status was not sustained.|$|E

50|$|The {{location}} of the original abbey church from the 8th century <b>is</b> controversial. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{at the site of}} today's clergy house, where remains of a small church <b>have</b> <b>been</b> discovered. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> where the 12th-century church stands today. Or <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> sited where larger foundations were excavated in 1968/69, north of the parish church.|$|R
5|$|Historically, {{this series}} of events is {{extremely}} improbable. Constantius had already left Helena {{by the time he}} left for Britain. Additionally, no earlier source mentions that Helena was born in Britain, let alone that she was a princess. Henry's source for the story is unknown, though <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> lost hagiography of Helena.|$|E
5|$|After the impact, villagers who had {{approached}} the impact site grew sick from a then-unexplained illness, {{with a wide}} array of symptoms. Two days later, Peruvian scientists confirmed that there had indeed been a meteorite strike, quieting widespread speculation that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> geophysical rather than a celestial event. At that point, no further information on the cause of the mystery illness was known. The ground water in the local area is known to contain arsenic compounds, and the illness is now believed to have been caused by arsenic poisoning incurred when residents of the area inhaled the vapor of the boiling arsenic-contaminated water.|$|E
5|$|As {{the bird}} became extinct before {{significant}} field observations could be made, not much {{is known about}} its behavior. The Lānai hookbill is only known to have eaten {{the fruit of the}} ōpuhe; however, it is unlikely that its unique bill would have developed to eat fruit, and <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> snail specialist. The hookbill has not been seen since 1918, and by 1940 nearly all of Lānai's forests were converted into pineapple fields, destroying the bird’s habitat. The combination of habitat destruction and the introduction of feral cats and rats are thought to have led to the Lānai hookbill’s extinction.|$|E

50|$|There is also {{a longer}} version of the Theology, the authorship of which is uncertain. According to Shlomo Pines, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> written by Isma'ilis.

5|$|Because the {{earthquake}} occurred before seismometers were {{operating in the}} region, {{the magnitude of the}} shock and its location were never precisely determined, but the intensity reports that are available for the event were studied, and various epicenters for the event were proposed based on these limited data. One study presented an estimated moment magnitude of 6.5–7.0, with a proposed location {{on the east side of}} the Cascade Range near Lake Chelan. The results of a separate study indicated that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> larger event, placing the shock in the North Cascades, just south of the Canada–United States border at Ross Lake.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} Saxon and early medieval period {{there were at}} least four {{buildings}} on the summit. The base of a stone cross demonstrates Christian use of the site during this period and <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> hermitage. The broken head of a wheel cross dated to the 10th or 11th centuries was found part way down the hill and may have been the head of the cross that stood on the summit. The head of the cross is now in the Museum of Somerset in Taunton.|$|E
5|$|From the 740s {{until the}} end of the Northumbrian kingdom, coins were issued by most kings, {{although}} in variable quantities. Until recently no coins from Eardwulf's reign were known, which suggested that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> time of instability, or perhaps that the kingdom was impoverished by the payment of tribute to Offa and Coenwulf of Mercia. It is now known that the issue of new coins continued during Eardwulf's reign, as two of his coins were identified in the 1990s. Issues of new currency appear to have been limited under Eardwulf, and significant numbers of Northumbrian coins are not again attested until the reign of Eardwulf's son Eanred.|$|E

50|$|It is disputed {{who made}} the first Punschkrapfen and where it came from. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{introduced}} to Vienna in the Middle Ages by the Avars, or the Ottoman armies brought the Punschkrapfen to Vienna (the Second Turkish Siege), or <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> invented by an imperial court confectioner.|$|R
50|$|It is {{not clear}} which precise {{location}} Josephus meant when he described the Caspian gates. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the Gates of Derbent (lying due east, nearer to Persia), or <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the Darial Gorge, (lying west, bordering Iberia or Georgia proper.

5|$|In its path, Charlie {{caused more}} than 250 deaths. The {{hurricane}} produced Jamaica's deadliest natural disaster of the 20th century, causing more than 152 deaths and $50,000,000 in damages. The hurricane {{was described as}} Tampico's worst tropical cyclone since 1936, and it caused more than 100 fatalities in the surrounding areas. Many bodies were not recovered after flooding. The hurricane produced peak gusts of 160mph (260km/h) at the airport, and its strongest sustained winds were unmeasured in mainland Mexico, suggesting that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> Category4 hurricane at landfall.|$|E
5|$|Taken {{together}} with the other sources above, this Hospital {{must be seen as}} a significant medieval establishment. It served a number purposes; especially the provision of a sub-monastic care home for locals. There is no clear evidence about the inclusion of women. The location of the hospital adjacent to a river crossing on the drove road indicates that it was a travellers inn. The hospital at Soutra Aisle in the Scottish Borders served a similar purpose. In addition to being a Traveller's Inn, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> Chantry for the Cathedral in Old Aberdeen.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known religious monument is the Catholic holy well in Penrhys first {{mentioned in}} the 15th century, though <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> place of pagan worship before this. This pilgrimage site {{was identified as a}} 'manor' belonging to the Cistercian Abbey of Llantarnam and was seen {{as one of the most}} important religious sites in Wales, because of its Marian shrine. This holy site was the main reason people would pass through the commote; it was even thought to be the main reason why the first bridges were built over the River Rhondda.|$|E

5|$|The use {{of black}} and white is {{regarded}} as dramatic, and although it may have been influenced by 1940s and 1950s works of Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline and Robert Motherwell, it is more likely a commentary on Mondrian's 1917 Composition in Black and White. Alternatively, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> reference to another of Mondrian's Pre-World War I black and white oval paintings, such as Pier and ocean, 1915. This complementary source art was common of Lichtenstein's 1960s work on frequently advertised objects. Lichtenstein describes his sources as Mondrian Plus and Minus paintings.|$|E
5|$|When Sélestat {{started to}} appear in written {{documents}} in the 8th century, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> market town or simply a village populated by fishermen and farmers. The area {{was part of the}} estate of Eberhard, a member of the Alsatian ducal family, who donated it to Murbach Abbey {{at the end of his}} life. In 775, Charlemagne spent Christmas in Sélestat, which indicates that the town must have had enough appropriate buildings and population to accommodate his court and troops.|$|E
5|$|Beeston crag {{is one of}} a {{chain of}} rocky hills {{stretching}} across the Cheshire Plain. Pits dating from the 4thmillennium BC indicate the site of Beeston Castle may have been inhabited or used as a communal gathering place during the Neolithic period. Archaeologists have discovered Neolithic flint arrow heads on the crag, as well as the remains of a Bronze Age community, and of an Iron Age hill fort. The rampart associated with the Bronze Age activity on the crag has been dated to around 1270–830 BC; seven circular buildings were identified as being either late Bronze Age or early Iron Age in origin. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> specialist metalworking site.|$|E

5|$|Nico Ditch was {{constructed}} some {{time between the}} end of Roman rule in Britain in the early 5th century and the Norman conquest in 1066. Its original purpose is unclear, but it may have been used as a defensive fortification or as an administrative boundary. It possibly marked a 7th-century boundary for the expansionist Anglo-Saxons, or <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> late 8th or early 9th century boundary marker between the kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria. In the early medieval period, the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and Wessex struggled for control over North West England, along with the Britons and the Danes. Whatever its earlier use, the ditch {{has been used as a}} boundary since at least the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|Several {{suggestions}} {{have been}} made {{for the history of}} the Great Stone. There was a succession of plagues in Manchester from the 14th century onwards, and during the Great Plague of 1655–56 the holes {{in the top of the}} stone were filled with vinegar or holy water, through which coins were passed in the belief that would halt the spread of the disease. But the holes are probably too deep for that to have been the stone's original purpose. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> marker on the Roman road between Northwich and Manchester, or some kind of boundary marker. The Great Stone is also thought to have been the base of an Anglo-Saxon cross shaft. A local legend had it that the stone was slowly sinking into the earth, and that its ultimate disappearance would mark the end of the world.|$|E
5|$|The marsh {{rice rat}} (Oryzomys palustris) is a semiaquatic North American rodent {{in the family}} Cricetidae. It usually occurs in wetland habitats, such as swamps and salt marshes. It is found mostly in the eastern and {{southern}} United States, from New Jersey and Kansas south to Florida and northeasternmost Tamaulipas, Mexico; its range previously extended further west and north, where <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> commensal in corn-cultivating communities. Weighing about , the marsh rice rat is a medium-sized rodent that resembles the common black and brown rat. The upperparts are generally gray-brown, but are reddish in many Florida populations. The feet show several specializations for life in the water. The skull is large and flattened, and is short at the front.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> that Mrs Lammle {{tried in}} some manner to excuse her conduct to herself by depreciating the poor little victim of whom {{she spoke with}} acrimonious contempt. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> too that in this she did not quite succeed, for it is very {{difficult}} to resist confidence, and she knew she had Georgiana's.|$|R
