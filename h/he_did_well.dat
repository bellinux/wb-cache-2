5|$|During the 1780s, Johnson {{achieved}} success: <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>well</b> {{financially and}} his firm published more books with other firms. Although Johnson had begun {{his career as}} a relatively cautious publisher of religious and scientific tracts, he was now able to take more risks and he encouraged friends to recommend works to him, creating a network of informal reviewers. Yet Johnson's business was never large; he usually had only one assistant and never took on an apprentice. Only {{in the last years of}} his life did two relatives assist him.|$|E
5|$|Hayes {{attended}} the common schools in Delaware, Ohio, and enrolled in 1836 at the Methodist Norwalk Seminary in Norwalk, Ohio. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>well</b> at Norwalk, {{and the following}} year transferred to The Webb School, a preparatory school in Middletown, Connecticut, where he studied Latin and Ancient Greek. Returning to Ohio, he attended Kenyon College in Gambier in 1838. He enjoyed his time at Kenyon, and was successful scholastically; while there, he joined several student societies and became interested in Whig politics. He graduated with highest honors in 1842 and addressed the class as its valedictorian.|$|E
5|$|Himmler's first name, Heinrich, {{was that}} of his godfather, Prince Heinrich of Bavaria, {{a member of the}} royal family of Bavaria, who had been tutored by Gebhard Himmler. He {{attended}} a grammar school in Landshut, where his father was deputy principal. While <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>well</b> in his schoolwork, he struggled in athletics. He had poor health, suffering from lifelong stomach complaints and other ailments. In his youth he trained daily with weights and exercised to become stronger. Other boys at the school later remembered him as studious and awkward in social situations.|$|E

5|$|In 1974, Gingrich {{made his}} first bid for {{political}} office as the Republican candidate in , which stretched from the southern Atlanta suburbs to the Alabama state line. He lost to 20-year incumbent Democrat Jack Flynt by 2,770 votes. Gingrich ran up huge margins in the suburban areas of the district, {{but was unable to}} overcome Flynt's lead in the more rural areas. Gingrich's relative success surprised political analysts. Flynt had never faced a serious challenger; Gingrich was the second Republican to ever run against him. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>well</b> against Flynt although 1974 was a disastrous year for Republican candidates nationally due to fallout from the Watergate scandal of the Nixon administration.|$|E
5|$|On Monday, 26 August, Gloucestershire met Lancashire {{again at}} the Clifton College Close Ground and, despite another good innings by Hornby, Gloucestershire this time were victorious by 8 wickets. Grace had won the toss and put Lancashire in to bat first. Grace the bowler was once more the star {{performer}} as he took 7–77 and 5–32, but this time <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>well</b> with the bat and made a good 49 in difficult conditions. His brother Fred scored 73 not out and this was crucial to the Gloucestershire success. Grace scored 20 not out in the second innings as Gloucestershire made 32–2 to win.|$|E
5|$|Bradley {{was born}} and raised in Crystal City, Missouri, a small town 45 miles south of St. Louis where he excelled at {{basketball}} from an early age. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>well</b> academically and was an all-county and all-state basketball player in high school. He was offered 75 college scholarships, but declined them all to attend Princeton University. He earned a gold medal as a member of the 1964 Olympic basketball team and was the NCAA Player of the Year in 1965, when Princeton finished third in the NCAA Tournament. After graduating in 1965, he attended Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship, delaying a decision for two years on whether or not to play in the National Basketball Association (NBA).|$|E

5|$|Graham {{was born}} in Ulmarra, New South Wales, on 23 October 1920, and was educated at Grafton High School. Highly intelligent, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>well</b> at school and {{achieved}} a high position in the Leaving Certificate. After joining the Australian Army in January 1938, {{at the age of}} 19 he graduated from the Royal Military College, Duntroon (RMC) in August 1940, following the outbreak of the Second World War. He was subsequently allocated to the Armoured Corps as a regular officer in the Permanent Military Force (PMF) with the rank of lieutenant. At Duntroon Graham had excelled academically and was known for his unorthodox and innovative tactical solutions to military problems. Top of his graduating class, he received the Kings Medal for his achievements. Shortly after his commissioning he married Joyce Lawrence of Canberra on 20 August 1940, and the couple later had two sons—Stuart born in 1941, and Ray born in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Saunders {{attended}} the local mission school at Lake Condah, where <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>well</b> in maths, geometry and languages. His father, meanwhile, taught Reg and Harry about the bush, and {{encouraged them to}} read Shakespeare and Australian literature. After completing eight years of schooling, Saunders earned his merit certificate. His formal education thus ended, {{he went to work}} at the age of 14 as a millhand in a sawmill. Employers regularly withheld payments for Aboriginal labourers at this time, but Saunders refused to work unless he was paid his full entitlement, and his employer relented. He worked and furthered his education until 1937, when he went into business with his father and brother, operating a sawmill in Portland, Victoria; the sawmill was destroyed in a bushfire in 1939.|$|E
5|$|Van Grunsven {{first met}} Bonfire {{when he was}} {{two and a half}} years old, having been under saddle for only a week. He was later {{purchased}} by Van Grunsven's father. At first it appeared that the young horse would be a poor prospect, as his hot temperament led to poor gaits. However, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>well</b> at learning advanced dressage moves such as the piaffe and passage, and so Van Grunsven continued to work with him. He improved, and by the time he was seven years old, he was competing at the Grand Prix level. His temperament continued to lead to difficult rides, and he had a tendency to spook at small items near the ring; these tendencies decreased as he grew older.|$|E

5|$|Devers {{graduated}} from York High School in May 1905. He applied to, and was accepted by, Lehigh University, {{with the intention}} of studying engineering, but then Congressman Daniel F. Lafean offered him an appointment to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York. He entered the Academy in June with the class of 1909. Among his classmates were George S. Patton, William Hood Simpson, and Robert L. Eichelberger, who would also become four-star generals in World War II, and John C. H. Lee, who would become a three-star general. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>well</b> in his studies, and excelled in sports, playing shortstop on the Army baseball team and guard on the Army Black Knights' basketball squad. He also played polo. He {{graduated from}} West Point on 11 June 1909, ranking 39th in his class of 103, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in his chosen branch: the field artillery. There were only nine positions available, but enough of the higher-ranking cadets chose other branches for Devers to secure his first preference.|$|E
5|$|One of five {{children}} of Irish-Swedish descent, Lindwall had a difficult childhood during the Great Depression, with both parents dying before he finished high school. Lindwall was inspired in his childhood after watching England's Harold Larwood, the fastest bowler of the era, terrorise the Australian batsmen during the notorious Bodyline series of 1932–33 with short-pitched intimidatory bowling. During his teenage years, Lindwall rose {{through the ranks of}} Sydney Grade Cricket at St. George under the tutelage of Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly, who was regarded as the finest bowler in the world at the time. Lindwall made his first-class debut for New South Wales in 1941–42. At the same time, Lindwall, a fine athlete, was playing for St. George in the first-grade of the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership as a full back. With the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, interstate cricket was cancelled and in 1943, Lindwall joined the army and served in New Guinea until 1945. Lindwall returned to Australia still suffering from the after-effects of tropical disease, but he quickly made an impact upon the resumption of first-class cricket. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>well</b> enough to gain selection a tour of New Zealand, where he made his Test debut in March 1946 in a match that was retrospectively accredited. Lindwall returned to Australia and spent the winter playing football for St. George, helping his team to the grand final of the 1946 NSWRFL season, after which he retired to concentrate solely on cricket.|$|E
5|$|Ranariddh {{was born}} in Phnom Penh to Sihanouk and his first wife Phat Kanhol, a ballet dancer {{attached}} to the royal court. Ranariddh was separated from his mother at three years of age when she remarried, and subsequently grew up mostly {{under the care of}} his aunt, Norodom Ketkanya and grandaunt, Norodom Sobhana. Ranariddh attended primary education at Norodom School and completed part of his high school studies at Lycee Descartes in Phnom Penh. During his childhood, he developed a close relationship with his grandparents, Norodom Suramarit and Sisowath Kossamak, but was distanced from his father. In 1958, Ranariddh was sent to a boarding school in Marseille together with his half-brother Norodom Chakrapong. Ranariddh initially planned to pursue medical studies as <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>well</b> in science subjects, but was persuaded by Kossamak to study law. After finishing high school in 1961, he enrolled in the undergraduate programme of law at the University of Paris. He struggled to focus on his studies in Paris, which he attributed to the social distractions that he encountered in the city.|$|E
