40|$|The {{cardiovascular}} {{effects of}} <b>doxazosin,</b> a quinazoline derivative related to prasozin were investigated and compared to prazosin in the rabbit. Radioligand binding studies using rabbit cerebral membranes showed that both <b>doxazosin</b> and prazosin were roughly equipotent at displacing [3 H]-prazosin from specific binding sites. However, the lower pA 2 value for <b>doxazosin</b> at alpha 1 -adrenoceptors in isolated thoracic aorta preparations suggests a lower potency compared to prazosin. The dose-related pressor effects of intravenous phenylephrine {{were used to}} assess vascular alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonism in vivo. There was a close agreement between alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist potency and maximum hypotensive effects with both <b>doxazosin</b> and prazosin. The alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist effects of <b>doxazosin</b> were more prolonged than those of prazosin. Studies using either radioligand binding or pressor responses to B-HT 920 showed that <b>doxazosin</b> did not show any significant affinity for the alpha 2 -adrenoceptor. Similarly, no direct vasodilator effects were observed either in animals administered angiotensin II or in isolated thoracic aorta spiral strip preparations contracted with potassium. <b>Doxazosin</b> has a longer terminal elimination half-life than prazosin. The pharmacokinetics of <b>doxazosin</b> were linear over the dose range examined. Following pharmacological 'autonomic blockade' and treatment with prazosin, <b>doxazosin</b> did not cause any further fall in blood pressure.

The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and maximum urinary flow rate were used to assess the efficacy of the treatment. RESULTS: At study completion, the mean dose of <b>doxazosin</b> was 6. 1 mg/day and alfuzosin 8. 8 mg/day. The least squares mean (se) change from baseline in total IPSS was - 9. 23 (0. 6) for <b>doxazosin</b> and - 7. 45 (0. 6) (both P < 0. 001) for alfuzosin. The respective mean change from baseline in irritative symptoms was - 3. 5 (0. 2) and - 2. 8 (0. 3) (both P < 0. 001). The differences between the treatment groups were statistically significant in favour of <b>doxazosin</b> (total IPSS, P = 0. 036; irritative symptoms, P = 0. 049). The improvement between groups was also significantly different for postvoid residual urine volume, at - 29. 19 (8. 6) and + 9. 59 (8. 9) mL for <b>doxazosin</b> and alfuzosin, respectively (P = 0. 002).
