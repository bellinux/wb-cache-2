5|$|In 1916, {{the passing}} loop {{was used by}} one pair of {{passenger}} trains in the evening, with an extra down train (toward Amlwch) making seven down and six up trains per day. The railmotor train's services had grown to 24 single trips between Gaerwen/Holland Arms and Llangefni/Red Wharf Bay. The continuing shortages of World War <b>I</b> <b>meant</b> that in January 1917 many passenger services were to be cut to give more resources to the war effort. The railways were slow {{to recover from the}} wartime hardships, and in 1921 there were six passenger trains to and from Amlwch, and only 18 single trips by the motor train.|$|E
5|$|The {{organisation}} {{of society}} is obscure {{in the early}} part of the period, for which there are few documentary sources. Kinship probably provided the primary unit of organisation and society was divided between a small aristocracy, whose rationale was based around warfare, a wider group of freemen, who had the right to bear arms and were represented in law codes, above a relatively large body of slaves, who may have lived beside and become clients of their owners. By the thirteenth century there are have sources that allow greater stratification in society to be seen, with layers including the king and a small elite of mormaers above lesser ranks of freemen and what was probably a large group of serfs, particularly in central Scotland. In this period the feudalism introduced under David <b>I</b> <b>meant</b> that baronial lordships began to overlay this system, the English terms earl and thane became widespread. Below the noble ranks were husbandmen with small farms and growing numbers of cottars and gresemen with more modest landholdings.|$|E
5|$|From {{the twelfth}} century there are sources that allow the {{stratification}} in society {{to be seen in}} detail, with layers including the king and a small elite of mormaers above lesser ranks of freemen and what was probably a large group of serfs, particularly in central Scotland. In this period the feudalism introduced under David <b>I</b> <b>meant</b> that baronial lordships began to overlay this system, the English terms earl and thane became widespread. Below the noble ranks were husbandmen with small farms and growing numbers of cottars and gresemen (grazing tenants) with more modest landholdings. The combination of agnatic kinship and feudal obligations has been seen as creating the system of clans in the Highlands in this era. Scottish society adopted theories of the three estates to describe its society and English terminology to differentiate ranks. Serfdom disappeared from the records in the fourteenth century and new social groups of labourers, craftsmen and merchants, became important in the developing burghs. This led to increasing social tensions in urban society, but, in contrast to England and France, {{there was a lack of}} major unrest in Scottish rural society, where there was relatively little economic change.|$|E

25|$|Smith was {{replaced}} by Christopher Cumming, {{who had worked for}} the North British Railway. The demands of World War <b>I</b> <b>meant</b> a shortage of traction, and six locomotives were built to older designs, three 'Loch' Class and three 'Castle' Class, which arrived in 1917. Cumming designed a 4-4-0 tender locomotive, with Robinson superheaters, and two of these also arrived in 1917 to work the Far North Line. Eight 4-6-0 goods locomotives to a Cummings design, also with Robinson superheaters, arrived in 1918–19. The 'Clan' Class was designed for the Perth to Inverness route, 4-6-0 tender locomotives with superheaters and six wheel tenders and eight were built by Hawthorn, Leslie & Co, four in 1919 and four in 1921. Cummings resigned due to ill health early in 1922 and David Chalmers Urie was appointed successor. The Highland Railway ceased to exist on 31 December 1922, passing 173 locomotives to the London, Midland & Scottish Railway; twenty-three of these were withdrawn from traffic before being renumbered by the new company.|$|E
25|$|Although the 200Tdi engine {{had been}} an undoubted {{technological}} and sales success, it had certain limitations and flaws {{that needed to be}} rectified. Despite the numerous differences, it was still in essence a direct-injection version of the older Diesel Turbo engine. It was also considered rather raucous and unrefined, especially for use in the Discovery and Range Rover models. A special version of the engine had to be produced to fit the Defender, and problems with weak head gasket had been identified. The British Army (and some other military buyers) had not opted for the 200Tdi because it could not be fitted with a 24-volt generator for powering radio equipment- instead the Army continued to buy vehicles with 2.5-litre naturally aspirated diesels. Upcoming European diesel emissions regulations (Euro <b>I)</b> <b>meant</b> that Land Rover would be forced to radically alter the engine anyway. The resulting development project (coded Romulus) produced the 300Tdi engine. Although externally very similar to the Discovery/Range Rover version of its predecessor, 208 changes were made. These included modifications to the block, cylinder head, fuel injector system and ancillary systems. The crankshaft, pistons and connecting rods were significantly altered over the 200Tdi. The most obvious external changes were the fitting of a rubber acoustic cover over the engine to reduce noise and the change to a single serpentine belt to drive the ancillaries instead of the multiple V-belts of the older engines. Emissions regulation included the fitting of an exhaust gas recirculation system. Power and torque outputs remained the same, and the engine had been specifically designed to be compatible with all the models in the Land Rover range without any changes. This meant that the Defender engines were fitted in the same tune as the Discovery/Range Rover engines. The 300Tdi was noticeably smoother and quieter than the 200Tdi, but was generally found to not be quite as economical in real-world use. It turned out that the Euro I emissions regulations were not as severe as Land Rover anticipated, and so the 300Tdi was able to remain in production until the introduction of the Euro III rules. When fitted to vehicles with an automatic transmission, power was increased to 122 horsepower {{to make up for the}} power losses in the transmission. These engines (designated 23L) had Bosch Electronic Diesel Control systems, where the mechanical injector system was controlled by a drive-by-wire electronic throttle to reduce emissions. The 300Tdi was replaced in 1998 by the 5-cylinder Td5, bringing to an end the line of Land Rover 4-cylinder engines that can be traced back to 1957. The Td5 engine was loosely based on the Rover Group's L-series diesel engine. The 300Tdi remained in production in Brazil, and was offered as an option on rest of world (non-UK/Europe) models. Following Ford's acquisition of Land Rover in 2000, the engine was used in Brazilian-built Ford pick-up trucks as well. Increasing emissions laws worldwide and falling sales led to production of the 300Tdi ending in 2006. A much-modified 2.8-litre version was built by International Engines in Brazil until 2010, and was available as an after-market fitment to Land Rovers through specialist converters. International then became MWM International Motores and a further update of the 300Tdi design was launched as the 3.0 Power Stroke. Although based around the same block and basic architecture as the 300Tdi the Power Stroke has major differences such as electronic common rail injection and new crossflow cylinder head with Overhead camshaft.|$|E

[...] Lyrically, according to Birgisson, the song carries some feminine viewpoints that Sheyne had managed to incorporate through her contribution. Ben Graham, the author of Maximum Jessica Simpson, noted that the lyrics suggest that Simpson finds it hard to keep her famous virginity image intact.

[...] "She knows she shouldn't give in, but seems past the point of no return," [...] he explained. However, Taylor stated that lyrically, the song demands for [...] "total fulfillment".
