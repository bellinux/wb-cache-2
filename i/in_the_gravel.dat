5|$|In the 1990s, {{the line}} lay unused and in disrepair, but the riveted-steel {{elevated}} structure was structurally sound. Around this time, the structure became known {{to a few}} urban explorers and local residents for the tough, drought-tolerant wild grasses, shrubs, and rugged trees such as sumac that had sprung up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gravel</b> along the abandoned railway. It was slated for demolition under the administration of then-mayor Rudy Giuliani.|$|E
5|$|Managed by the German SS and Trawnikis (also {{known as}} Hiwi guards – the {{auxiliary}} police enlisted from Soviet POW camps {{to assist the}} Germans), the camp consisted of two separate units. Treblinka I was a forced-labour camp (Arbeitslager) whose prisoners worked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gravel</b> pit or irrigation area and in the forest, where they cut wood to fuel the crematoria. Between 1941 and 1944, {{more than half of}} its 20,000 inmates died from summary executions, hunger, disease and mistreatment.|$|E
5|$|As {{the race}} {{approached}} its halfway point, Lotterer gained on the No. 9 Audi {{and moved into}} second place, becoming Audi's lead challenger to Porsche. After leaving the pit lane, Pierre Ragues's No. 43 Morand car billowed smoke because of an oil pressure sensor failure and his vehicle caught fire, causing him to retire at Arnage corner. Several LMGTE cars {{took the opportunity to}} change brake discs {{at this point in the}} morning, including Fernando Rees in the No. 99 Aston Martin. Returning to the track Rees' car failed to stop in time for the first Mulsanne Straight chicane and hit the rear of the TDS Racing Oreca-Nissan. The Oreca, which had held second place in the LMP2 category, was abandoned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gravel</b> at the chicane while Rees limped the damaged Aston Martin back to the garage for repairs to its front-left corner. The No. 26 G-Drive Ligier took over second place in LMP2, although still a lap behind the leading KCMG Oreca while the lead in LMGTE Pro was now left to Jordan Taylor's No. 64 Corvette and the No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari of Bruni on the same lap. In the early morning the No. 7 Audi's hold on second place was relinquished when the right-rear bodywork of the car came apart on the circuit and littered debris at the Porsche Curves, requiring a seven-minute stop for repairs and dropping the car down the race order.|$|E
50|$|His {{leisure time}} was chiefly {{devoted to the}} study of what was {{afterwards}} called the Stone Age and antediluvian man, as he expressed it. About the year 1830 he had found, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gravels</b> of <b>the</b> Somme valley, flints which in his opinion bore evidence of human handiwork; but not until many years afterwards did he make public the important discovery of a worked flint implement with remains of elephant and rhinoceros <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gravels</b> of Menchecourt. This was in 1846.|$|R
50|$|Cornwall and Devon {{provided}} {{most of the}} United Kingdom's tin, copper, and arsenic {{until the}} 20th century. Originally tin was found as alluvial deposits of cassiterite <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gravels</b> of stream beds. Eventually tin was mined under ground; underground mines sprang up {{as early as the}} 16th century. Tin lodes were also found in outcroppings of cliffs.|$|R
50|$|The Saltley handaxe is a {{quartzite}} {{hand axe}} found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gravels</b> of <b>the</b> valley of <b>the</b> River Rea <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Saltley area of Birmingham, England in 1890. Believed to be approximately 500,000 years old, {{it was the}} first human artefact from the paleolithic era found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> English Midlands, which had previously been considered not to have been inhabited {{before the end of the}} last glacial period.|$|R
5|$|Due to rain {{shortly before}} the start of the race, it {{commenced}} behind the safety car, with every car equipped with full wet tyres. The safety car came back into the pitlane at the end of lap five and racing began properly. While the top four drivers stayed out, several behind chose to make a pitstop for intermediate tyres. Just one lap later, Pascal Wehrlein became the first casualty of the still damp track, sliding off the track and getting stuck <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gravel,</b> leading to a brief virtual safety car period. During this time, both Hamilton and Rosberg changed tyres. The biggest winner of the first few laps was Sergio Pérez, who had worked up his way from tenth on the grid to fourth, ahead of Ricciardo. Meanwhile, at the front, Hamilton had established a five-second advantage over Rosberg, who soon came under attack by Verstappen, who was running well on the intermediate tyres. Bottas came into a spin on lap 11, losing positions and dropping back to 13th place. On lap 16, Sebastian Vettel was the first driver to make the switch to slick tyres, while Verstappen moved ahead of Rosberg into second position.|$|E
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race—two on Friday, {{and a third}} on Saturday. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted 90minutes. The third session was held on Saturday morning and lasted an hour. All three sessions were held on a dry track. Hamilton was fastest in the first session {{with a time of}} 1:35.630, 0.39 of a second ahead of Massa, who was next quickest. Räikkönen, Heikki Kovalainen of McLaren, Kubica, Alonso and Heidfeld rounded out the top seven. Sébastien Bourdais of Toro Rosso was eighth, having been quickest early in the session. Renault driver Nelson Piquet drove into the gravel beside the pit-lane entry, though managed to rejoin. Hamilton was again quickest in the second session; his early time of 1:35.750 was the fastest of the afternoon. The Renaults were next quickest, ahead of Jarno Trulli of Toyota, Red Bull driver Mark Webber, Massa, Bourdais and Räikkönen. Bourdais spun off at turn two late in the session and beached his car <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gravel.</b> Heidfeld was fastest in the final session with a time of 1:36.061, ahead of Hamilton, Kubica and Kovalainen. Massa, Räikkönen and Alonso lacked pace, and failed to make the top ten. Webber stopped late in the session when his engine failed on the back straight, requiring an engine change before qualifying. This would give him a ten-place penalty on the grid.|$|E
5|$|Wurz locked his brakes {{going into}} turn 15, {{causing him to}} beach his car <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gravel</b> trap and retired on lap 36. Button became the first driver to pit twice on lap 39. Coulthard {{replicated}} his manoeuvre into turn five on Michael Schumacher on lap 40, with the later pushed {{to the side of}} the track by Coulthard who took the lead. Michael Schumacher's right front wheel made slight contact with Coulthard's left front tyre in the process. Michael Schumacher then immediately withstood Häkkinen's attempts to overtake him. Frentzen and de la Rosa became the next two drivers to make pit stops on the same lap. Michael Schumacher and Häkkinen made pit stops for the second time on lap 43 and both emerged in third and fourth respectively. Barrichello's pit stop on the 44th lap saw him drop to fifth after his team had issues with fitting his right front tyre. Coulthard and Ralf Schumacher made pit stops over the next two laps. At the completition of lap 48, with the frontrunners completing their pit stops, the order was Coulthard, Michael Schumacher, Häkkinen, Barrichello, Villeneuve, Trulli, Ralf Schumacher, Frentzen, Button, Fisichella, Salo, Diniz, Heidfeld, Irvine, Alesi and Gené.|$|E

50|$|All {{trace of}} the town is gone, but {{small-scale}} mining continues today. The area of gold-bearing gravel extends from 1/4 mile east of Dome to 3 miles west of Dome, but most placer mining was centered on Monitor Gulch, 1 1/2 miles west of Dome. Most of <b>the</b> gold <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gravels</b> was found at or near bedrock in gulches, but much gold was recovered from bench <b>gravels</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area.|$|R
5|$|Montoya {{made his}} pit stop on lap 22. However, his pit stop proved problematic: the signal lights at his pit box stopped working, causing the Williams refuller {{to switch to}} the fuel rig for Ralf Schumacher and Montoya {{remained}} stationary for 20 seconds longer than usual. Montoya was also fuelled for longer than his team planned. Ralf Schumacher thus inherited the lead with Michael Schumacher behind him and Montoya re-emerged in fourth place. One lap later, Michael Schumacher took his pit stop and he {{came out with a}} fuel pressure problem which meant he pulled {{to the side of the}} main straight and retired. Burti spun off and beached his car <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gravel</b> trap at Nordkurve on the same lap. Ralf Schumacher made his pit stop on lap 24 and rejoined with a 10-second advantage. Villeneuve, Button and Alonso all followed Ralf Schumacher into the pit lane on the same lap. Alonso encountered a problem when leaving his pit box: the Minardi refuelling valve had a problem, and his car's afterburner remained on, though the flames extinguished themselves when Alonso accelerated out of the pit lane. Montoya pulled over to the side of the track on lap 25, with smoke billowing from his engine, and retired. Fisichella made a pit stop from fourth on lap 26 and re-emerged in fifth behind Villeneuve. Marques retired from the race with a gearbox problem on the same lap. Coulthard made a pit stop on lap 27 and immediately became the race's next retirement when he acclerated away from his pit box with a blown engine. The resulting event meant he pulled to the side of the circuit. Panis made his pit stop on lap 31 and came out behind Button and Alesi. Barrichello became the final driver to make a scheduled pit stop on the 32nd lap.|$|E
5|$|Roald Goethe {{was caught}} off guard as Hülkenberg lapped his No. 96 Aston Martin in Corvette Corner, causing Goethe to spin and heavily impact a {{concrete}} barrier leaving the turn. Goethe was conscious but needed aid in {{getting out of the}} Aston Martin requiring the intervention of a fourth safety car period. He was transported to a local hospital where he remained for several days and underwent surgery to two vertebra which had been fractured in the crash. Oliver Turvey had been the fastest driver in LMP2 at the time, bringing the Jota Gibson-Nissan into third place. The No. 64 Corvette came to the pit lane during the safety car period to change brakes, but was unable to get back out of pit lane in time before the exit was closed, forfeiting the class lead to the No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari. When racing resumed Webber was able to attack the No. 9 Audi after driving through traffic and take second position. The No. 42 Strakka Dome pulled off the track on the front stretch with gearbox issues and fluids leaked from his car, requiring a local slow zone. The No. 7 Audi of Lotterer made contact with Tandy's leading Porsche while both cars were in the slow zone, earning Lotterer a drive-through penalty. Viktor Shaitar overran the Indianapolis corner and became stuck <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gravel,</b> losing two laps as it was extracted by recovery vehicles and went into the pit lane but remaining in second place in LMGTE Am.|$|E

40|$|Due to a {{combination}} of local methanogenesis and high background concentrations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> groundwater, water <b>in</b> <b>the</b> River Lambourn is 51 times supersaturated with methane (162 nmol CH 4 L− 1). Pore-water concentrations of methane <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gravels</b> of <b>the</b> riverbed were much lower throughout the year (71 nmol CH 4 L− 1), suggesting significant methane oxidation. To investigate the potential for methane oxidation as a novel chemosynthetic source of carbon to the food web, we made simultaneous measurements, in laboratory chambers, of primary production, respiration, and methane oxidation associated with <b>the</b> <b>gravels.</b> Biomass-specific net primary production was up to 2. 7 µmol O 2 mg− 1 chlorophyll (Chl) h− 1 and was similarly high for respiration (2. 7 µmmol O 2 mg− 1 Chl h− 1). We also found active methane (CH 4) oxidation with <b>the</b> rate increasing <b>in</b> proportion to concentration. At the maximum rate of 0. 18 µmol CH 4 mg− 1 Chl h− 1 and a growth efficiency of 0. 8, net carbon fixation via methane oxidation was equivalent to 6 % of the carbon fixed via net photosynthetic primary production. However, production via methane oxidation could be proportionately much greater under the shade of the profuse instream or riparian vegetation, deep <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gravels,</b> and especially during winter, when light is limiting (< 25 µmol quanta m− 2 s− 1) ...|$|R
50|$|After 1870 some {{sporadic}} hydraulic operations {{continued in}} Confederate Gulch {{and its tributaries}} for many years. A company based in Milwaukee worked some old ground briefly in 1899. About nine years later, a company worked <b>gravels</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{lower end of the}} gulch using a Risdon dredge, but it shut down operations after three months when it found no values <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gravels.</b> Placering continued off and on during the late 1910s and 1920s, with at least two operations in 1928; lack of water frequently hampered success.|$|R

25|$|The {{life cycle}} of an {{anadromous}} salmon begins and, if it survives the full course of its natural life, usually ends in a gravel bed in {{the upper reaches of}} a stream or river. These are the salmon spawning grounds where salmon eggs are deposited, for safety, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gravel.</b> The salmon spawning grounds are also the salmon nurseries, providing a more protected environment than the ocean usually offers. After 2 to 6 months the eggs hatch into tiny larvae called sac fry or alevin. The alevin have a sac containing the remainder of the yolk, and they stay hidden <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gravel</b> while they feed on the yolk. When the yolk has gone they must find food for themselves, so they leave the protection of the gravel and start feeding on plankton. At this point the baby salmon are called fry. At {{the end of the summer}} the fry develop into juvenile fish called parr. Parr feed on small invertebrates and are camouflaged with a pattern of spots and vertical bars. They remain in this stage for up to three years.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of May 21, 2000, the sheriff's {{department}} in Humboldt County, Nevada received a report that a man had assaulted {{a woman in a}} red and silver GMC truck on Grass Valley Road.

25|$|During the stops, Hill got by Alesi with Häkkinen {{getting ahead}} of Coulthard. Häkkinen closed up on Berger {{but was unable to}} pass. Although it began to rain on lap 40, still there were no major changes at the top, with the top 6 {{remaining}} unaltered. On lap 62, Häkkinen's engine blew up, putting him out. On the last lap, Barrichello and Blundell were fighting for sixth when they collided, with Blundell beached <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gravel</b> trap and Barrichello dropping behind Fittipaldi and Lehto. Fittipaldi was, however, disqualified for an underweight car, giving sixth to Lehto. Schumacher won ahead of Hill, Alesi, Berger, Coulthard and Lehto.|$|E
25|$|A {{spirited}} {{drive from}} the 2008 Le Mans winners Rinaldo Capello and McNish saw their Audi R10 TDI progress through the field after a trip <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gravel</b> early in the race, {{all the way up}} to second behind their sister car. When the leading Audi came in for an unplanned pit stop and was pulled into the pit for some rear suspension repairs, this handed the lead to McNish and Capello, who took a well deserved win. The Charouz Lola-Aston Martin B08/60 was second, driven by Jan Charouz and Stefan Mücke. The Pescarolo of Romain Dumas and Boullion got a well deserved podium finish.|$|E
25|$|Qualifying {{had started}} with a threat of rain as Menu took pole {{position}} in qualifying with championship leading team–mate Muller second. The first session was stopped twice, firstly when Proteam Racing's Mehdi Bennani got stuck <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gravel</b> at the final corner and then again when Pepe Oriola also went off at the final corner and crashed into the wall. O'Young finished the first session tenth and therefore took the reversed grid pole position for race two {{where he would be}} joined on the front row by Coronel. Yukinori Taniguchi was 12th {{at the end of the}} session and was the quickest local driver.|$|E

25|$|On Sunday afternoons at 3pm, between May and October, Rosary processions are held. These are {{traditionally}} attended {{by thousands of}} visitors. The rosary {{is led by the}} parish priest, a tradition started by Fr. Taylor and carried on by his successor, Fr. George Mullen (later Canon George Mullen). The priest would stand on the parapet of the Glass Chapel, from which a clear view could be obtained, both of the Grotto itself and of the movement of the procession along the shrine's gravel paths. Each Sunday procession culminated in Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament in the upper Glass Chapel. Many local people remember the discomfort of kneeling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gravel</b> as children, at the moment of adoration in the Benediction service.|$|E
25|$|The {{culture was}} {{initially}} {{named after the}} village of Cucuteni in Iași County, Romania. In 1884, Teodor T. Burada, after having seen ceramic fragments <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gravel</b> used to maintain the road from Târgu Frumos to Iași, investigated the quarry in Cucuteni from where the material was mined, where he found fragments of pottery and terracotta figurines. Burada and other scholars from Iași, including the poet Nicolae Beldiceanu and archeologists Grigore Butureanu, Dimitrie C. Butculescu and George Diamandy, subsequently began the first excavations at Cucuteni {{in the spring of}} 1885. Their findings were published in 1885 and 1889, and presented in two international conferences in 1889, both in Paris: at the International Union for Prehistoric and Protohistoric Sciences by Butureanu and {{at a meeting of the}} Society of Anthropology of Paris by Diamandi.|$|E
25|$|Menu {{led from}} start to finish leading a {{comfortable}} Chevrolet 1–2–3 in the opening Suzuka race. The lack of action near the front was representative of much of field, although Gabriele Tarquini jumped up from sixth to fourth at the start to lead home independent race winner Alex MacDowall. Having overtaken James Nash, Alberto Cerqui then quickly ended his race <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gravel</b> at turn one. Mehdi Bennani collided with Aleksei Dudukalo while attempting a pass, Dudukalo held the car and continued while Bennani was forced to pit. Monteiro finished tenth to score a point in the debut race for the Honda Civic. After the race, Dudukalo received a 30-second penalty for colliding with Bennani and he dropped to 18th in the classification, while Nash and Cerqui both received 30-second penalties for start infringements dropping Nash to 19th.|$|E
