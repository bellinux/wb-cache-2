40|$|International audienceDeath {{in fishing}} gear of non-target species (called ‘bycatch’) {{is a major}} concern for marine wildlife, and mostly {{worrying}} for long-lived species like cetaceans, considering their demographic characteristics (slow population growth rates and low fecundity). In European waters, cetaceans are highly impacted by this phenomenon. Under the Common Fishery Policy, the EC 812 / 2004 regulation constitutes a legal frame for bycatch monitoring on 5 – 10 % of fishing vessels > 15 m. The aim of this work was to compare parameters and bycatch estimates of common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) provided by <b>observer</b> <b>programmes</b> in France and UK national reports and those inferred from stranding data, through two approaches. Bycatch was estimated from stranding data, first by correcting effectives from drift conditions (using a drift prediction model) and then by estimating the probability of being buoyant. <b>Observer</b> <b>programmes</b> on fishing vessels allowed us to identify the specificity of the interaction between common dolphins and fishing gear, and provided low estimates of annual bycaught animals (around 550 animals year− 1). However, <b>observer</b> <b>programmes</b> are hindered by logistical and administrative constraints, and the sampling scheme seems to be poorly designed for the detection of marine mammal bycatches. The analyses of strandings by considering drift conditions highlighted areas with high levels of interactions between common dolphins and fisheries. Since 1997, the highest densities of bycaught dolphins at sea were located {{in the southern part of}} the continental shelf and slope of the Bay of Biscay. Bycatch numbers inferred from strandings suggested very high levels, ranging from 3650 dolphins year− 1 [2250 – 7000] to 4700 [3850 – 5750] dolphins year− 1, depending on methodological choices. The main advantage of stranding data is its large spatial scale, cutting across administrative boundaries. Diverging estimates between <b>observer</b> <b>programmes</b> and stranding interpretation can set very different management consequences: <b>observer</b> <b>programmes</b> suggest a sustainable situation for common dolphins, whereas estimates based on strandings highlight a very worrying and unsustainable process...|$|R

40|$|In {{the western}} and central Pacific purse seine fishery, {{observers}} have been deployed under the licensing provisions of two sub-regional arrangements, the US Tuna Treaty (between the United States {{and members of the}} FFA) and the FSM Arrangement (an arrangement for joint licensing of vessels flagged or sponsored by members of the PNA). The <b>observer</b> <b>programmes</b> associated with these arrangements are often referred to as sub-regional <b>observer</b> <b>programmes,</b> and are administered by the FFA Secretariat. Typically, these <b>programmes</b> have achieved <b>observer</b> coverage rates in excess of 20 %. Observers have also been deployed in several countries under national programmes, which cover domestic purse seine vessels fishing primarily in the home EEZ, and/or bilaterally licensed purse seiners fishing in that EEZ. These programmes have been managed by the coastal States concerned. Coverage rates have been variable, ranging from> 20 % in the PNG national <b>observer</b> <b>programme,</b> to typically < 10 % in most other national programmes. These sub-regional and national programmes have been supported by both SPC-OFP and the FFA. SPC-OFP has taken the lead role in the provision of observer training, data forms, data processing and data quality assurance. FFA has managed the logistics of observer placement an...|$|R
