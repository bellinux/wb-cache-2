25|$|In 1946, the Finnish Government {{appointed}} {{a committee to}} start planning the rebuilding of the Finnish icebreaker fleet. The committee, consisting of {{the director of the}} Finnish Maritime Administration, Svante Sundman, and two experienced Finnish shipbuilders, K. Albin Johansson and Ossian Tybeck, delivered its final report on {{the construction of a new}} icebreaker in the following year. The main dimensions of the new 4,415-ton icebreaker, large enough to escort 10,000-ton <b>dry</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>ships</b> or 16,000-ton tankers, were based on the old Jääkarhu, but the triple-expansion steam engines were replaced with a modern diesel-electric propulsion system, similar to the 1939-built Sisu, with a combined output of 10,500 shp. In the early drafts, the new icebreaker was designed with three propellers (two in the stern and one in the bow) and an asymmetric stem that would compensate for the transverse force caused by the bow propeller. However, these features were later dropped after extensive model testing and co-operation with Swedish naval architects in favor of a completely new design.|$|E
