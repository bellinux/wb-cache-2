40|$|AbstractWhile being {{compared}} with commonly used organic solvents, ionic liquids are known of their low volatility. Thus {{they are usually}} considered to be green solvents to replace so far used organic solvent to eliminate the pollution of volatile organic compounds. Because of the low volatility, ionic liquids are also considered to be nonflammable in previous studies. However, recent studies do show ionic liquids are flammable. In this study, the auto-ignition characteristics of three ionic liquids, 1 -Ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium <b>ethylsulfate,</b> 1 -Hexyl- 3 -methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide and 1 -Decyl- 3 -methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfony) imide, are explored. Auto-ignition temperatures of these three ionic liquids are measured according to ASTM E 659 method, and differential scanning calorimeter are used to investigate their thermal decomposition characteristics. Experimental {{results show that the}} auto-ignition temperatures of 1 -Ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium <b>ethylsulfate,</b> 1 -Hexyl- 3 -methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide and 1 -Decyl- 3 -methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide are 423. 1 ̊C, 452. 1 ̊C and 441. 5 ̊C, respectively. According to the code of NFPA 70 (National Electrical Code), electric equipment for handling these ionic liquids should meet the requirement of T codes to be T 2, T 1 and T 2 for 1 -Ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium <b>ethylsulfate,</b> 1 -Hexyl- 3 -methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide and 1 -Decyl- 3 -methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide, respectively. The results of differential scanning calorimeter show that all these three ionic liquids decompose at the temperature below their auto-ignition temperature. It {{should be noted that the}} decomposition of 1 -Ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium <b>ethylsulfate</b> is endothermic, which clearly indicates that the combustion observed at is auto-ignition temperature is the oxidation reaction of the vapors of decomposition products rather than the oxidation reaction of the vapors of ionic liquids itself...|$|E

40|$|The {{removal of}} {{nitrogen}} compounds from transportation fuel {{is proven to}} enhance the efficiency of desulfurization process, which aims to meet the rigorous regulations regarding zero-emissions. Ionic liquids (ILs) and deep eutectic solvents (DESs) were screened for this purpose using quantum chemical methods. Geometry optimization was performed for all involved species at Hartree-Fock level and 6 - 31 G* basis set. Generation of cosmo files using Density Functional Theory and Triple zeta valence potential basis set was carried out at single point calculation. The cosmo files were used to obtain σ-profiles and σ-potentials for qualitative screening of ILs and DESs. (i) The screening of ILs revealed that cations with an aromatic ring have better capacity as hydrogen bond donors (HBDs) than do non-aromatic cations, whereas the acetate anion appeared to have better affinity towards HBD than did <b>ethylsulfate</b> and methanesulfonate anions. The σ-profile and σ-potential analysis confirmed {{that there is an}} interaction between nitrogen compounds and cations via CH-π interaction along with between nitrogen compounds and anions via hydrogen bonding. Moreover, a detailed quantum chemical calculation was performed to investigate the interaction between ILs and nitrogen compounds at molecular level, in which optimized geometry was used to obtain the orbital energies, global scalar properties, interaction energies and partial charges. The calculations indicated that cations with an aromatic ring, that is, imidazolium and pyridinium, combined with either <b>ethylsulfate</b> or methanesulfonate anion have favorable interaction with nitrogen compounds in comparison to cations without an aromatic ring. (ii) The screening of DESs showed that the interaction between nitrogen compounds and DESs is based on hydrogen bonding. Altogether, 94 DESs were examined quantitatively by predicting the values of the activity coefficients at infinite dilution of nitrogen compounds and diesel in the DESs. These were then used to estimate selectivity, capacity and iv performance index at infinite dilution as the basis of the screening process taking into account the cation, anion and HBD choices as well as the salt:HBD molar ratio. Based on the screening results, 22 ternary liquid-liquid equilibria (LLE) experiments were carried out at room temperature and atmospheric pressure to test three ILs – namely 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium <b>ethylsulfate,</b> 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylpyridinium <b>ethylsulfate,</b> and 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium methanesulfonate, and two DESs – namely tetrabutylammonium bromide/ethylene glycol (1 : 2) and tetrabutylphosphonium bromide/ethylene glycol (1 : 2). The aim was to remove non-basic and basic nitrogen compounds from n-hexadecane as a model diesel compound. NMR spectroscopy was used for the compositional analysis. Consistency tests were performed to ascertain the reliability of all experimental data. All ternary systems reported distribution ratios and selectivity values greater than unity with minimal cross-contamination between the extract and raffinate phases. The ternary LLE data were correlated with NRTL model and compared with COSMO-RS predictions, both of which were in excellent agreement with the experimental tie-lines. In conclusion, the quantum chemical screening of ILs and DESs explained the interaction between ILs/DESs and nitrogen compounds at molecular level, which facilitates solvent selection for the denitrogenation process. The ternary LLE experiments with the selected ILs and DESs confirmed that these solvents have high potential for industrial extractive denitrogenation...|$|E

40|$|Ionic Liquids are {{becoming}} increasingly interesting as solvents for multiphase and other applications. However, their synthesis in continuous mode at production scale is still challenging, especially for the solvent-free non-catalysed amine quaternisations. The synthesis of 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium <b>ethylsulfate</b> by alkylation of N-methylimidazol with diethylsulfate was studied as a representative for reactions with high heat output, strongly changing physical properties and sensitivity towards precise control of process conditions. In order to characterise the reaction thermodynamics, reaction calorimetric experiments were conducted in semi-batch and fed-batch mode. It could be demonstrated that the non-ideality of the reaction system is prohibitive {{for the application of}} a simple thermodynamic model neglecting enthalpy contributions from reaction-related changes in mixture composition. Experimentally the latter could not be separated from the dosing-induced enthalpy changes and the reaction enthalpy under ideal conditions due to the reactivity of the system already at room temperature. The reaction enthalpies obtained with the simplified model showed systematic variations over the covered concentration range of up to 40 % of the absolute values. ATR (attenuated total reflectance) based fibre optic mid-infrared spectroscopy has been evaluated for reaction monitoring of the presented reaction, but suffered significantly from the non-ideality of the mixture obvious from the overrepresentation of diethylsulfate in the infrared spectra.

Observed solubilities in the present ionic liquids are again very high, being similar to our previous report on ammoniaÂ +Â ionic liquid mixtures and all cases show negative deviations from ideal solution behavior. Experimental PTx data have been successfully correlated with our equation-of-state (EOS) model. All the excess properties (enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs energy) show negative values, indicating some intermolecular complex formation between ammonia and ionic liquids. Application of the present systems to the absorption cooling-heating cycle has also been discussed. Ammonia Solubility Ionic liquid Equation of state Absorption cycle...|$|E
40|$|Ionic liquids are {{innovative}} media characterised by an easy tunability {{of physical}} and chemical properties with the potential for broad usefulness in a wide spectrum of chemical applications. One example of such an application is a complex biorefinery concept leading to the exploitation of the biomass for the production of energy (heat, power, fuel) and value added products. Until now ionic liquids have proven their feasibility to dissolve selectively biomass as a whole as well as individual carbohydrates. This work demonstrates the solubility of carbohydrates and value added products—sugar alcohols—which can be obtained from biomass through the biorefinery concept. The novelty of our investigation includes either solubility studies of sugar alcohols or an involvement of unexplored ionic liquids yet. In this research, a variety of ionic liquids constituted by imidazolium, pyridinium and phosphonium cations was applied. Furthermore, anions of ionic liquids, attractive from a {{point of view of a}} broad application, such as: 2 -(2 -methoxyethoxy) <b>ethylsulfate,</b> hydrogen sulfate, thiocyanate, tricyanomethanide, tetrachloroferrate, perfluorobutane sulfonate and tosylate were investigated.

(AN: T = (273. 15 to 313. 15) K; DCM: T = (273. 15 to 308. 15) K; water: T = (278. 15 to 313. 15) K) in the concn. range c = (≈ 0. 25 to ≈ 5) × 10 - 3 mol/dm- 3. The data were analyzed with Barthel's low-concn. chem. (lcCM) model to obtain the limiting molar conductivities, Λ∞(T), and assocn. consts., KA°(T), of this electrolyte in the investigated solvents. From Λ∞(T) the Eyring activation enthalpy of charge transport was detd. and found to be slightly larger than the corresponding value for viscous flow of the solvent. Strong ion pairing was found for the electrolyte in DCM (KA° ≈ 6 / 104 mol- 1 /dm 3), whereas ion assocn. in AN is rather weak (KA° ≈ 40 mol- 1 /dm 3). From the temp. dependence of KA°(T) the enthalpy and entropy of the ion-pairing process were calcd., and ion assocn. was found to be entropy-driven for both nonaq. solvents.

The uncertainties for the temperature, pressure, and compositions measurements for the phase equilibria are ± 0. 1 K, ± 0. 01 kPa and ± 0. 0004, respectively. A qualitative {{analysis of the}} variation of the properties with changes in solvent and temperature was per- formed. The Peng–Robinson equation of state (PR EoS), coupled with the Wong–Sandler mixing rule (WS), is {{used to describe the}} experimental data. To calculate activity coefficients we used three different models: NRTL, UNIQUAC, and COSMO-SAC. Since the predictive liquid activity coefficient model COSMO-SAC is used in the Wong–Sandler mixing rule, the resulting thermodynamic model is a completely predictive one. The prediction results for the density and for the (vapor + liquid) equilibria have a deviation lower than 2. 3 % and 1. 6 %, respectively.

Membrane processes in combination with the use of ionic liquids are recently under research and development in order to demonstrate a zero solvent emission process for CO 2 capture. In this work, the application of a cross-flow membrane contactor is studied for CO 2 absorption when the ionic liquid 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium <b>ethylsulfate</b> is used as solvent. A mathematical model considering a parallel flow configuration is applied for a cross-flow system in order to describe the mass transfer rate. At a macroscopic level, K(overall) a is calculated considering different mixing models corresponding to plug flow and continuous stirred models and a first order mass transfer rate. A microscopic model based on laminar flow has been applied, obtaining a membrane mass transfer coefficient of k(m) = 3. 78 x 10 (- 6) m. s(- 1) which is about five times higher than that obtained in the macroscopic model. The interfacial area, a, allows the comparison of efficiencies between cross-flow and parallel membrane contactor systems in terms of the product (K(overall) a). status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Studies of 1 -hexyl- 3 -methyl-imidazolium <b>ethylsulfate</b> ([HMIM] EtSO 4) {{using an}} {{extended}} surface forces apparatus show, {{for the first}} time, an ordered structure within the nanoconfined ionic liquid (IL) between mica surfaces that extends up to [similar] 60 nm from the surface. Our measurements show the growth of this ordered IL-film upon successive nanoconfinements—the structural changes being irreversible upon removal of the confinement—and {{the response of the}} structure to shear. The compressibility of this system is lower than that typically measured for ILs, while creep takes place during shear, both findings supporting a long-range liquid-to-solid transition. AFM (sharp-tip) studies of [HMIM] EtSO 4 on mica only reveal [similar] 2 surface IL-layers, with order extending only [similar] 3 nm from the surface, indicating that confinement is required for the long-range IL-solidification to occur. WAXS studies of the bulk IL show a more pronounced ordered structure than is the case for [HMIM] with bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide as anion, but no long-range order is detected, consistent with the results obtained with the sharp AFM tip.

40|$|Selective {{absorption}} into {{a liquid}} {{is a widespread}} method to separate and concentrate sulfur dioxide from gas emissions, reducing air pollution and environmental risks. Process intensification can be performed first by the substitution of the equipment (e. g. scrubbers) for a membrane device to avoid drops dragging, and second by the substitution of the absorption solvent (e. g. N,N-dimethylaniline) for ionic liquids to avoid solvent volatilization. According to this intensification, a zero solvent emission process has been developed. The ionic liquid 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium <b>ethylsulfate</b> is used as the absorption solvent {{and the results are}} compared to the N,N-dimethylaniline results. A ceramic hollow fibre module is the membrane device where the sulfur dioxide absorption takes place. A gas stream with a typical composition of roasting effluents flows through the shell side and the absorption liquid flows counter currently by the inside of the hollow fibres. The influence of carbon dioxide in the absorption is also evaluated and the overall mass transfer coefficients are calculated. The difference between the estimated mass transfer coefficients and the experimental results for both solvents is discussed assuming partial wetting of the membrane...|$|E

Liquid–liquid equilibria data were obtained for mixtures of (sulfolane or 4 -methyl-N-butylpyridinium tetrafluoroborate ([mebupy]BF 4) or 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium <b>ethylsulfate</b> ([emim]C 2 H 5 SO 4) or 1, 3 -dimethylimidazolium methylsulfate ([mmim]CH 3 SO 4) or 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium methylsulfate ([bmim]CH 3 SO 4)) + toluene + n-heptane at T = 313. 2 and 348. 2 K and p = 0. 1 MPa. The experimental data for the binary and ternary systems were well correlated with the NRTL model. The toluene/heptane selectivity values were higher with all four ionic liquids tested than with sulfolane, {{which is one of the}} most common solvents for extraction of aromatic hydrocarbons from mixtures of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons used in industry. The ionic liquid [mebupy]BF 4 showed an optimal combination of a high toluene distribution coefficient and a high toluene/n-heptane selectivity. These values were for the range of toluene concentrations below 55 mol% at 313. 2 K and below 45 mol% at 348. 2 K higher than those with sulfolane. The ionic liquid [mebupy]BF 4 is, therefore, a suitable solvent to replace sulfolane for an industrial extraction process for the separation of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons...|$|E

This study explored the effect of genetic background on the ALD-associated urinary metabolome using the Ppara-null mouse model on two different backgrounds, C 57 BL/ 6 (B 6) and 129 /SvJ (129 S), along with their wild-type counterparts. Reversed-phase gradient UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS analysis revealed that urinary excretion {{of a number of}} metabolites, such as <b>ethylsulfate,</b> 4 -hydroxyphenylacetic acid, 4 -hydroxyphenylacetic acid sulfate, adipic acid, pimelic acid, xanthurenic acid, and taurine, were background-dependent. Elevation of ethyl-β-d-glucuronide and N-acetylglycine was found to be a common signature of the metabolomic response to alcohol exposure in wild-type as well as in Ppara-null mice of both strains. However, increased excretion of indole- 3 -lactic acid and phenyllactic acid was found to be a conserved feature exclusively associated with the alcohol-treated Ppara-null mouse on both backgrounds that develop liver pathologies similar to the early stages of human ALD. These markers reflected the biochemical events associated with early stages of ALD pathogenesis. The results suggest that indole- 3 -lactic acid and phenyllactic acid are potential candidates for conserved and pathology-specific high-throughput noninvasive biomarkers for early stages of ALD...|$|E
40|$|Trivalent {{lanthanide}} (Ln 3 +) -containing complexes have {{a number}} of important applications in molecular imaging, catalysis, medical diagnosis, information storage, and environmental sensing. The properties of Ln 3 +-containing complexes that are useful for these applications are influenced by coordination chemistry, including the number of coordinated ligands and ligand-exchange rates. The coordination numbers for water molecules bound to Eu 3 + and Tb 3 + have been studied by luminescence-decay measurements; however, the coordination numbers of other important oxygen-containing functional groups such as ketones, esters, ethers, sulfonyls, amides, phosphine oxides, and aldehydes have not been as thoroughly studied in solution {{because of the lack of}} hydroxyl groups that quench the luminescence of Eu 3 + or Tb 3 +. Therefore, there is a need to develop analytical methods to measure the coordination of different functional groups to Ln 3 + ions. This thesis describes efforts to measure the number of solvent molecules coordinated to Dy 3 + ions using 17 O-NMR spectroscopy in acetone, ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylsulfonate, dimethylformaldehyde, di-isopropyl ketone, hexamethyl acetone and 4 -chlorobenzaldehyde. These solvents were selected because they contain a range of functional groups that have different electron-donating abilities and steric bulk. The measured coordination numbers were consistent with reasonable values, indicating that 17 O-NMR spectroscopy is a useful tool for measuring the coordination number of non-hydroxyl oxygen-containing ligands. In addition to coordination numbers of ligands, ligand-exchange rates are another important parameter that impacts the coordination chemistry of Ln 3 + ions. This thesis describes the study of water-exchange rates of Ln 3 + ions in room temperature ionic liquids. Room temperature ionic liquids were studied because they are important solvents for Ln 3 + ions. Luminescence-decay measurements were used to measure the coordination number of Eu 3 + and Tb 3 + ions in water/ 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium <b>ethylsulfate</b> (1 : 19, v/v), and variable-temperature 17 O-NMR spectroscopy was used to measure the water-exchange rates of Gd 3 +, Tb 3 +, Dy 3 +, Ho 3 +, and Er 3 + ions in water/ 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium <b>ethylsulfate</b> (1 : 19, v/v). Water-exchange rates increased with increasing charge density of Ln 3 + ions, except for Tb 3 +. This trend of water-exchange rates is opposite to the trend of Ln 3 + aqua ions, indicating that the change of solvents can manipulate ligand-exchange rates of Ln 3 + ions to the extreme case of inversing exchange-rate trends. For Tb 3 + ions, the fast water-exchange rate was attributed to the presence of a trace amount of Tb 4 + that was confirmed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. These findings suggest variable-temperature 17 O-NMR spectroscopy is a useful technique to study the ligand-exchange rates of Ln 3 + ions in ionic liquids...|$|E
