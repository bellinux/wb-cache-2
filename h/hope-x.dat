2500|$|In November 1999 it was {{announced}} that Japan's National Space Development Agency planned to lease land on Kiritimati (Christmas Island) for 20 years, on which to build a spaceport. The agreement stipulated that Japan was to pay US$840,000 per year and would also pay for any damage to roads and the environment. A Japanese-built downrange tracking station operates on Kiritimati and an abandoned airfield on the island was designated as the landing strip for a proposed reusable unmanned space shuttle called <b>HOPE-X.</b> <b>HOPE-X,</b> however, was eventually cancelled by Japan in 2003.|$|E
2500|$|Japan {{started to}} {{construct}} spy satellites after North Korea test fired a Taepodong missile over Japan in 1998. The North Korean government claimed the missile was merely launching a satellite to space, and accused Japan of causing an arms race. The Japanese constitution adopted after World War II limits military activities to defensive operations. On May 2007 Prime Minister Shinzo Abe {{called for a}} bold review of the Japanese Constitution to allow the country to take {{a larger role in}} global security and foster a revival of national pride. Japan has not yet developed its own manned spacecraft and does not have a program in place to develop one. The Japanese space shuttle <b>HOPE-X,</b> to be launched by the conventional space launcher H-II, was developed but the program was postponed and eventually cancelled. Then the simpler manned capsule Fuji was proposed but not adopted. Pioneer projects of single-stage to orbit, reusable launch vehicle horizontal takeoff and landing ASSTS and vertical takeoff and landing Kankoh-maru were developed but have not been adopted.

5000|$|In 1997, {{well into}} the study, {{it was decided that}} <b>HOPE-X</b> should be {{modified}} into an unmanned cargo vehicle with the addition of automated approach and docking systems, and a cargo bay with doors similar to the one on the U.S. Space Shuttle. It was believed this would result in a [...] "quick and dirty" [...] cargo supply system for ISS, which was suffering from continued delays due to problems with the Shuttle program. It was estimated that such a conversion could be completed for an additional US$292 million, less expensive than designing a completely new ballistic cargo vehicle for the H-2 launcher, and much less expensive that the estimated US$2.9 billion needed to complete the full-sized HOPE. Even the small <b>HOPE-X</b> launched on unmodified H-2A rockets would deliver a useful 3 MT to ISS, about the same as the Progress spacecraft's approximate 2500 kg. <b>HOPE-X</b> was about 15.2 m long with a 9.7 m wingspan, and looked quite a bit like the U.S. X-20 Dyna-Soar.|$|E
50|$|Japan began {{development}} in the 1980s of the <b>HOPE-X</b> experimental spaceplane, to be launched on its H-IIA expendable launch vehicle. A string of failures in 1998 led to funding reduction, and the project's cancellation in 2003.|$|E
50|$|Although Japan {{developed}} the <b>HOPE-X,</b> Kankoh-maru, and Fuji manned capsule spacecraft, {{none of them}} have been launched. Japan's current ambition is to deploy a new manned spacecraft by 2025 and to establish a Moon base by 2030.|$|E
50|$|Kawasaki {{has also}} participated in {{projects}} such as the development of reusable launch vehicles for spacecraft that will handle future space transport, space robotics projects such as the Japanese Experiment Module for the International Space Station, the <b>HOPE-X</b> experimental orbiting plane and the docking mechanism for the ETS-VII.|$|E
50|$|In the 1980s Japan {{was working}} on the <b>Hope-X</b> spaceplane, {{intended}} to launch on the H-II rocket. Depending on the configuration of the rocket, it would have a mass of between 10 and 20 tonnes, and be able to carry both crew and cargo. It would launch vertically and land horizontally. The programme was terminated by JAXA in 2003 after scale mockup testing.|$|E
50|$|Hyflex was a {{miniaturized}} suborbital demonstrator of <b>HOPE-X</b> {{launched in}} 1996. Hyflex flew to 110 km altitude and succeeded in atmospheric reentry, subsequently achieving hypersonic flight. Though Hyflex achieved a controlled aircraft descent, {{it was not}} designed for a planned aircraft landing, the engineers opting instead for a splashdown without a parachute. Recovery of the Hyflex failed and it sank in the Pacific Ocean.|$|E

50|$|In 1974, the Heiwa Sogo Bank {{started a}} resort venture and floated plans for {{construction}} of the national oil reserve on the island, but neither plan came to fruition. In March 1980, the last resident left the island.In 1995, a subsidiary of Tateishi Construction acquired the island, and announced plans to construct a landing field for the Japanese space shuttle, <b>HOPE-X,</b> on the island. Other plans to establish a spent nuclear fuel storage facility were also announced. However, subsequently no construction has been taken and the <b>HOPE-X</b> project itself was cancelled in 2003. In 2009, Mageshima came under consideration as a possible relocation site for the Marine Corps Air Station Futenma in Ginowan, Okinawa, {{or at least as}} a site for the United States Navy to relocate its aircraft carrier aircraft touch-and-go training. However, Tateishi Construction subsequently came under investigation for tax fraud and for collusion with politicians over the project. Initial logging to clear an area for the proposed runways was performed without proper permission, and in September 2011 local fishermen filed lawsuits alleging damage to fishing grounds due to increased runoff created by the illegal logging.|$|E
50|$|Japan has ten astronauts {{but has not}} yet {{developed}} its own {{manned spacecraft}} and is not currently developing one officially. A potentially manned space shuttle-spaceplane <b>HOPE-X</b> project launched by the conventional space launcher H-II was developed for several years (including test flights of Hyflex/OREX prototypes) but was postponed. The simpler manned capsule Fuji was proposed but not adopted. Projects for single-stage to orbit, horizontal takeoff reusable launch vehicle and landing ASSTS and the vertical takeoff and landing Kankoh-maru also exist but have not been adopted.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} HOPE {{project called}} for {{the building of a}} sub-scale orbital prototype known as <b>HOPE-X,</b> for H-2 Orbiting Plane, Experimental. This would be used for flight testing and systems validation, before moving onto the larger HOPE, which used many of the same parts and general design in a 4-man 22 MT design. As the name implies, both would be launched on Japan's new H-2 launcher, the full-scale HOPE requiring substantial upgrades in performance. At the time, Japan was an up-and-coming industrial powerhouse, and their space program was moving from success to success. There was little doubt, and a little trepidation, that HOPE would be successful.|$|E
50|$|In 1998, the H-2 {{suffered}} from a string of failures. A re-evaluation of the entire space program followed, and budget constraints later forced a reduction in overall funding by US$690 million to US$4.22 billion for the five-year spending period between 1998 and 2002. This would force a delay in the timeline for the <b>HOPE-X,</b> with its first flight in 2003. By this time NASDA had spent only US$305 million since the project was approved in 1988, reflecting the status as a research project. The next year the H-2 project was cancelled outright, proceeding with the simplified and lighter H-2A alone. Hughes {{pulled out of the}} H-2A project at about this time; they had initially purchased ten launches on the system and it was considered a major international success for NASDA.|$|E
50|$|HOPE {{continued}} to soldier on. In 2000, an agreement was signed {{to land the}} returning vehicle at Christmas Island's Aeon Airstrip. The High Speed Flight Demonstration project consisted of 25% scale models of <b>HOPE-X</b> to test navigation technologies and flight characteristics. As the 2003 deadline approached a number of debates broke out about the launcher profile, with many arguing that the H-2 should be replaced with a jet-powered cargo aircraft for an air-start. The first flight was pushed back further to 2004. Before this milestone was reached a major re-organization of NASDA took place {{in order to address}} its obvious overcommitment in light of Japan's economic contraction, especially now that there were demands for a crash program to develop spy satellites in order to track North Korean nuclear efforts. JAXA was formed, and HOPE was cancelled during this process.|$|E
5000|$|Japan {{has also}} {{developed}} the M-V three-stage solid-fuel rocket, somewhat similar in design to the U.S. LGM-118A Peacekeeper ICBM, {{giving it a}} missile technology base. It now has an easier-to-launch second generation solid-fuel rocket, Epsilon. Japan has experience in re-entry vehicle technology (OREX, <b>HOPE-X).</b> Toshiyuki Shikata, a Tokyo Metropolitan Government adviser and former lieutenant general, said {{that part of the}} rationale for the fifth M-V Hayabusa mission, from 2003 to 2010, was that the re-entry and landing of its return capsule demonstrated [...] "that Japan's ballistic missile capability is credible." [...] In 2011, former Minister of Defense Shigeru Ishiba explicitly backed the idea of Japan maintaining the capability of nuclear latency: [...] "I don't think Japan needs to possess nuclear weapons, but it's important to maintain our commercial reactors because it would allow us to produce a nuclear warhead in {{a short amount of time}} ... It's a tacit nuclear deterrent" ...|$|E
5000|$|Japan {{has been}} {{cooperating}} with the United States on missile defence since 1999.

40|$|This {{document}} presents {{some aspects}} of TRANSYS (TRANsportation SYStem) 2. 0; the new version of TRANSYS. This includes the sequential sizing process, which defines the vehicle's dimensions and evaluates it's flight performance, with a new general purpose geometry generation program assembly for a commercial Computer Aided Design (CAD) tool I-DEAS T. M., the DLR original Computational Fluid Dynamics analyis (CFD) tool HOTSOSE and the DLR original trajectory simulation tool TOSCA-TS. The new program assembly can automatically create various CAD models (aeroshell and major structure components) of recent Single Stage To Orbit (SSTO) concepts with aerodynamically refined shapes and rocket engines, such as a lifting body (e. g. X- 33) and a winged vehicle (e. g. FESTIP (Future European Space Transportation Investigations Program FSS- 1). Then the output data {{is used in the}} next processes for the aerodynamic analysis and mass estimation. The first part of this document describes the purposes and backgrounds of this method. The second part describes the geometry models, programming of a program assembly and CAD model generation procedures. The third part describes the vehicle mass estimation with a simpjle mass model. The fourth part describes the meshing of CAD models and aerodynamic calculation. The fifth part describes the trajectory simulation. The last part describes the evaluation of this method. The validation results of these processes and tools with the <b>HOPE-X</b> system design data are successfully shown. And the future possibilities are also presented...|$|E
