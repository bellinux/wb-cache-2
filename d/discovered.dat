SN 2005ap, <b>discovered</b> on 3 March 2005, is the brightest known supernova to date with a peak absolute magnitude of about −22.7. Due to its great distance from Earth (4.7 billion light-years), it was not {{visible to the naked}} eye and was <b>discovered</b> telescopically. SN1979C, <b>discovered</b> in 1979, retained its original X-ray brightness for 25 years despite fading in visible light.|$|E
5|$|A flint {{arrowhead}} <b>discovered</b> in Sale {{suggests a}} prehistoric human {{presence at the}} location, {{but there is no}} further evidence of activity in the area until the Roman period. A 4th-century hoard of 46Roman coins was <b>discovered</b> in Ashton upon Mersey, one of four known hoards dating from that period <b>discovered</b> within the Mersey basin. Sale lies along the line of the Roman road which runs between the fortresses at Chester (Deva Victrix) and York (Eboracum), via the fort at Manchester (Mamucium); the present-day A56 follows the route of the road through the town. After the Roman departure from Britain in the early-5th century, Britain was invaded by the Anglo-Saxons.|$|E

5|$|French chemist Bernard Courtois <b>discovered</b> Iodine in 1811, and in 1896 Eugen Baumann {{documented}} it as {{the central}} ingredient in the thryoid gland.

David Marine in 1907 provided iodine is necessary for thyroid function. Thyroxine itself was first isolated in 1914 and synthesized in 1927, and trirodothyroxine in 1952. The conversion of T4 to T3 was <b>discovered</b> in 1970. The process of discovering TSH took place over the early to mid twentieth century.
