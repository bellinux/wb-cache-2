5|$|Jackson {{collaborated with}} filmmakers George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola on the 17-minute 3D film Captain EO, which debuted in September 1986 {{at both the}} {{original}} <b>Disneyland</b> and at Epcot in Florida, and in March 1987 at Tokyo <b>Disneyland.</b> The $30 million movie was a popular attraction at all three parks. A Captain EO attraction was later featured at Euro <b>Disneyland</b> after that park opened in 1992. All four parks' Captain EO installations stayed open well into the 1990s: the Paris installation {{was the last to}} close, in 1998. The attraction would later return to <b>Disneyland</b> in 2010 after Jackson's death.

5|$|On July 17, 1955, <b>Disneyland</b> and the <b>Disneyland</b> Railroad opened, and the {{day began}} with Walt Disney driving the DRR's No. 2 {{locomotive}} and its passenger train into Main Street, U.S.A. Station with California Governor Goodwin J. Knight and AT Railway President Fred G. Gurley riding in the locomotive's cab. They were greeted at the station's platform by the park opening ceremony's host Art Linkletter, actor Ronald Reagan, and several television camera crews broadcasting the festivities nationwide. After exiting the locomotive, Linkletter briefly interviewed Disney, Knight, and Gurley before they walked towards the town square in the Main Street, U.S.A. section where Disney officially dedicated <b>Disneyland.</b> The DRR eventually {{became one of the}} most popular steam-powered railroads in the world with an estimated 6.6 million passengers each year.|$|E

It was also incorporated into <b>Disneyland's</b> Light Magic, Paint the Night Electrical Parade, and Remember... Dreams Come True as a tribute to the Main Street Electrical Parade.|$|R

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} <b>Disneyland</b> Railroad opened, A, B, and C tickets were {{introduced}} in <b>Disneyland</b> for admission to its rides, and C tickets, the highest-ranked tickets, were required to ride the DRR.

5|$|Snow White's Scary Adventures is {{a popular}} theme park ride at <b>Disneyland</b> (an opening day {{attraction}} dating from 1955), Tokyo <b>Disneyland,</b> and <b>Disneyland</b> Paris. Fantasyland at Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom underwent an expansion from 2012 to 2014. The Snow White's Scary Adventures ride was replaced with Princess Fairytale Hall, where Snow White and other princesses are located for a meet and greet. Included in the 2013 expansion of Fantasyland is the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train roller coaster. Snow White, her Prince, the Queen, and the Seven Dwarfs are also featured in parades and character appearances throughout the parks. Disneyland's Fantasyland Theater hosted Snow White: An Enchanting Musical from 2004 to 2006.|$|E
5|$|The WDWRR's {{development}} {{was led by}} Roger E. Broggie, who also oversaw {{the construction of the}} <b>Disneyland</b> Railroad in <b>Disneyland</b> in Anaheim, California. The attraction's locomotives were acquired from the Ferrocarriles Unidos de Yucatán, a narrow-gauge railroad system in Mexico. After being shipped to the United States, they were altered to resemble locomotives built in the 1880s and restored to operating condition. Each locomotive was also given a set of passenger cars, which were built from scratch.|$|E

5|$|A {{few weeks}} before the debut of the No. 5 locomotive, the railroad, {{for the first time in}} its history, hosted a privately owned train on its track. On the morning of May 10, before <b>Disneyland</b> opened for the day, a private {{ceremony}} was held at New Orleans Square Station to honor Disney animator and rail enthusiast Ollie Johnston, supposedly to thank him for helping to inspire Walt Disney's passion for trains, which led to the creation of <b>Disneyland.</b> The true motive for having Johnston there was soon revealed when a simple steam train not part of the DRR's rolling stock, consisting of a locomotive named Marie E. and a caboose, rolled towards the station and stopped at its platform. Johnston, a previous owner of the steam train, used to run it on his vacation property, which he sold, along with the train, in 1993. The man who now owned the train was Pixar film director John Lasseter, who had brought the train to <b>Disneyland</b> in order to give Johnston, his mentor, an opportunity to reunite with and drive his former locomotive. Johnston, then in his nineties, was helped into the Marie E., and with Lasseter at his side, he grasped the locomotive's throttle and drove his former possession three times around the DRR's main line. Although Johnston died in 2008, Lasseter continues to run the Marie E., the caboose, and an assortment of train cars on his private Justi Creek Railway, which is complemented by the depot building and water tower from Ward Kimball's former Grizzly Flats Railroad.|$|E

Mike & Sulley to the Rescue! opened at <b>Disneyland</b> Resort's Disney California Adventure in Anaheim, California. In 2007, Monsters, Inc. Laugh Floor opened at Walt Disney World Resort's Magic Kingdom in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, replacing The Timekeeper.

5|$|In 1966, a five-gondola {{train set}} with green-and-white-striped awnings and a five-gondola train set with blue-and-white-striped awnings, {{referred}} to by <b>Disneyland</b> employees as Holiday Green and Holiday Blue respectively, {{were added to the}} DRR's rolling stock. Both train sets had side-facing bench seating like the Holiday Red freight train. By the time that the new Holiday Green and Holiday Blue trains sets were introduced in 1966, the DRR's original roundhouse, located {{on the end of a}} spur line connected to the main line near the Rivers of America in the Frontierland section, had been replaced by a larger roundhouse, located on the end of a new spur line connected to the main line in the Tomorrowland section. The new roundhouse, where the DRR's locomotives and train cars are stored and maintained, was also built to house the storage and maintenance facility for the <b>Disneyland</b> Monorail.|$|E
