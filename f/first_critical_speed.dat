50|$|Rotating {{machinery}} produces vibrations {{depending upon}} {{the structure of the}} mechanism involved in the process. Any faults in the machine can increase or excite the vibration signatures. Vibration behavior of the machine due to imbalance {{is one of the main}} aspects of rotating machinery which must be studied in detail and considered while designing. All objects including rotating machinery exhibit natural frequency depending on the structure of the object. The critical speed of a rotating machine occurs when the rotational speed matches its natural frequency. The lowest speed at which the natural frequency is first encountered is called the <b>first</b> <b>critical</b> <b>speed,</b> but as the speed increases additional critical speeds are seen. Hence, minimizing rotational unbalance and unnecessary external forces are very important to reducing the overall forces which initiate resonance. When the vibration is in resonance it creates a destructive energy which should be the main concern when designing a rotating machine. The objective here should be to avoid operations that are close to the critical and pass safely through them when in acceleration or deceleration. If this aspect is ignored it might result in loss of the equipment, excessive wear and tear on the machinery, catastrophic breakage beyond repair or even human injury and loss of lives.|$|E

The original machine was designed in the early 1970 s, and had a highly responsive <b>first</b> <b>critical</b> <b>speed</b> with an amplification factor in the upper teens. With a rotor this sensitive to unbalance, heavy rubs and operational difficulties were often encountered during start up and shut down transients. For the fifth machine, it was inquired how the rotor's response sensitivity could be improved without compromising rotor interchangeability with the sister units. A squeeze film damper bearing, being the only practical solution, was proposed and implemented. The design and analysis methodology used in the development of the squeeze film damper bearing is discussed. To maintain rotor interchangeability, the design covers how the damper bearing was optimized to fit the available limited envelope. The systematic analytical approach demonstrates the importance of including support stiffness effects beyond the damper bearing.

40|$|Balancing of {{flexible}} rotor with bow using {{transfer matrix method}} MB Deepthikumar 1, AS Sekhar 2 and MR Srikanthan 1 Synchronous lateral vibration is a frequent cause of machine failure and {{is probably the most}} common source of machine noise and vibration. Among the broad ranges of faults that cause synchronous vibration, mass unbalance and bow are the most common faults present in the rotor and hence their detailed understanding is required. In the present study, a rotor model having both mass unbalance and bow is analyzed to find the influence of these faults on the synchronous response. The synchronous response of a rotor is a function of influence coefficients due to mass unbalance and bow. The influence coefficients are analytically derived using transfer matrix method for rotor bearing system having both mass unbalance and bow. The correction unbalance vector required to balance the rotor at its <b>first</b> bending <b>critical</b> <b>speed</b> is computed using these analytically derived influence coefficients and the rotor responses measured at a speed much lower than the <b>first</b> bending <b>critical</b> <b>speed.</b> The balancing method needs a good mathematical model for the rotor system in finding the influence coefficients for mass unbalance and bow.

40|$|In the {{aerospace}} and automotive applications driveshafts are manufactured using {{fiber reinforced composite}} materials. Compared to a conventional metallic driveshaft, a composite driveshaft gives higher natural frequencies and critical speeds, and lower vibration. The design of the driveshaft is dependent on its fundamental natural frequency and its <b>first</b> <b>critical</b> <b>speed,</b> and tapering the driveshaft can substantially improve {{the values of the}} natural frequency and <b>first</b> <b>critical</b> <b>speed.</b> In this thesis, the rotordynamic analysis of the tapered composite driveshaft is carried out using three finite element formulations: the conventional-Hermitian finite element formulation, the Lagrangian finite element formulation, and the hierarchical finite element formulation. These finite element models of the tapered composite shaft are based on Timoshenko beam theory, so transverse shear deformation is considered. In addition, the effects of rotary inertia, gyroscopic force, axial load, coupling due to the lamination of composite layers, and taper angle are incorporated in the conventional-Hermitian, the Lagrangian, and the hierarchical finite element models. The strain energy and the kinetic energy of the tapered composite shaft are obtained, and then the equations of motion are developed using Lagrange’s equations. Explicit expressions for the mass matrix, the gyroscopic matrix and the stiffness matrix of the tapered composite shaft are derived to perform rotordynamic analysis. The Lagrangian beam finite element formulation has three nodes and four degrees of freedom per each node while the conventional-Hermitian beam and the hierarchical beam finite element formulations have two nodes. The three finite element models are validated using the approximate solution based on the Rayleigh-Ritz method.

40|$|LecturePg. 25 - 32 One {{property}} of heavily to moderately loaded sleeve bearings is the resulting asymmetric stiffness and damping coefficients. These asymmetric properties often result in split first critical speeds. Since the horizontal stiffness is much softer than the vertical, a horizontal <b>first</b> <b>critical</b> <b>speed</b> may appear from several hundred to several thousand {{revolutions per minute}} lower than the vertical first critical. Tilting pad bearings produce more symmetric bearing properties. This symmetry usually results in a single unsplit <b>first</b> <b>critical</b> <b>speed</b> that is located approximately midway between the sleeve bearing split peaks. Two different case histories are examined. An induction motor and a steam turbine were both initially designed with tilting pad bearings.

As a last attempt short of a complete rotor redesign, switching to sleeve bearings was successful. Analytical results that support the decision to switch to sleeve bearings are shown along with actual test stand response plots. Additionally, for the steam turbine, results from a high speed balance are presented along with actual field speed-amplitude plots.

40|$|Electromagnetic {{fields in}} the air gap of an {{electric}} machine produce electromagnetic forces between the rotor and stator. The total force exerted on the rotor due to the eccentric rotor position is called the unbalanced magnetic pull. This eccentricity force is directed roughly over the shortest air gap. At low frequencies, the vibration amplitudes of flexural modes may {{be large enough to}} couple the electromagnetic system to the mechanical one. This electromechanical interaction changes the vibration behaviour of the system. The main purpose of this dissertation is to reveal the main rotordynamic consequences induced by the electromechanical interaction in cage induction motors. Another goal is to achieve this by deriving a simple and representative electromechanical rotor model with physical variables and parameters. In this study, a new parametric model was derived for the unbalanced magnetic pull induced by an arbitrary rotor motion in transient operation. The parameters of this model can be determined analytically from the basis of the machine characteristics or estimated numerically as in this study. To estimate the parameters, an efficient numerical method was developed from the analysis of impulse response. The numerical results showed that the simple electromagnetic force model, together with the estimated parameters, predicts the unbalanced magnetic pull fairly accurately. An electromechanical rotor model was derived by combining the Jeffcott rotor model with the simple electromagnetic force model, including two additional variables for the harmonic currents of the rotor cage. Applying this model, the rotordynamic effects of electromechanical interaction were studied. Three induction motors were used in the numerical examples. The results obtained show that the electromechanical interaction may decrease the flexural frequencies of the rotor, induce additional damping or cause rotordynamic instability. These interaction effects are most significant in motors operating at, or near, the <b>first</b> flexural <b>critical</b> <b>speed.</b> Excluding the potential rotordynamic instability, the numerical results indicate that the electromechanical interaction effectively reduces the unbalance response close to the <b>first</b> flexural <b>critical</b> <b>speed.</b> reviewe...|$|R

The goal of this thesis is to investigate the effects of such excitation forces. The extra excitation forces investigated here are the Thomas/Alford force due to the blade tip clearance change, the steam excitation force caused by the variation of inlet steam speed and state blade trailing wake and the dominant magnetic pull force due to dynamic eccentricity of the rotor. The main research results in this thesis include: (1) 	The modelling of the Jeffcott rotor and the 600 MW steam-turbine generator. The used in-house &# 145;transient&# 146; program can only handle the circular short bearings with the modified short bearing method while the simulated steam-turbine should be supported by tilting pad bearings. The <b>first</b> <b>critical</b> <b>speeds</b> of systems supported by tilting pad bearings are more approaching to the lab data for all four rotor models while that of journal bearing supported systems are normally lower than the real operating <b>critical</b> <b>speed.</b> (2) 	Applying three sorts of excitation forces into the single-stage rotor-bearing system. The numerical simulation shows that for the model with each single excitation force, all of these three forces need to reach some limit to force the system into the unsteady state. For all the three forces, higher limits are needed if the machine runs at lower running speeds. Furthermore, unbalance loading also can influence the system behaviours. As the unbalance increases, the system will still stay steady while the spectra become noisier, though the amplitude still low comparing to harmonics.
