5|$|Throughout this, Idelba {{has been}} {{secretly}} working on atomic physics {{and she and}} her fellow researchers have made some disturbing discoveries. They conclude that {{it would be possible to}} make a devastating weapon from nuclear chain reactions and fear that the military will try to create such bombs and restart the war. In order to prevent this, Idelba tries desperately to hide all evidence about her research and contacts concerned scientists in other parts of the world. The government learns of her work however and raids the Zawiyya to get <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> papers, but Budur manages to hide them. Idelba eventually dies of radiation poisoning from the materials she was working with and leaves all her research to Budur, who keeps her secret and eventually manages to organize an international conference of scientists to discuss the nuclear issue. The meeting is held in Isfahan in Iran (one of the few Islamic nations which has prospered since the war) and scientists from all over the world attend. They agree that none of them will work on the creation of nuclear weapons for their respective countries, no matter what pressure they are put under by their governments and also start a new international scientific movement to break down barriers between cultures in a spirit of reconciliation and friendship (they even create a new scientific calendar to be used by the whole world, with its year zero set from the time of the conference).|$|E

500|$|They {{see another}} person {{hiding in a}} car and demand that he come out. [...] It is the strange man. [...] He says he is meeting a friend to play checkers, but does not know when his friend is coming. [...] He does not have any {{identification}} and does not have a phone. [...] The pair demand that he open his trunk. [...] Inside are many CDs—the man proclaims his love of music—and a checker board. [...] To pass the time, the mysterious man engages Reyes and Scully in a game of checkers. [...] They play several rounds. [...] Reyes eventually realizes that the checkers' colors (red & black) are surrogates for Scully (a redhead) and herself (a brunette); The pair realize that the last victim, the numerologist (victim number 7) was a blonde, and that the murderer has been following a pattern of killing a blonde, then a redhead, then a brunette. [...] Thus, a redhead and a brunette are the anticipated hair-colors of the next two victims. [...] Scully and Reyes also realize that, although they assumed that the car that exited the garage was the killer, it was possible that the killer might still be inside the garage with them. [...] Scully and Reyes begin searching, but are surprised by the killer, who shuts off the lights, grabs Reyes and eventually gets <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> gun. [...] However, John Doggett (Robert Patrick), also realizing that the number [...] "6" [...] pattern is actually a [...] "9" [...] and that the killer must intend to have two more victims, arrives {{in the nick of time}} to shoot him. [...] Reyes attempts to ask the killer why he did what he did. [...] The killer begins to mouth a word, but dies before being able to speak to Reyes. [...] Scully and Reyes then realize that the mysterious man and his car have disappeared from the garage.|$|E
2500|$|Jane Alsop {{reported}} {{that on the}} night of 19 February 1838, she answered the door of her father's house to a man claiming to be a police officer, who told her to bring a light, claiming [...] "we have caught Spring-heeled Jack here in the lane". She brought the person a candle, and noticed that he wore a large cloak. The moment she had handed him the candle, however, he threw off the cloak and [...] "presented a most hideous and frightful appearance", vomiting blue and white flame from his mouth while his eyes resembled [...] "red balls of fire". Miss Alsop {{reported that}} he wore a large helmet and that his clothing, which appeared to be very tight-fitting, resembled white oilskin. Without saying a word he caught <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> and began tearing her gown with his claws which she was certain were [...] "of some metallic substance". She screamed for help, and managed to get away from him and ran towards the house. He caught her on the steps and tore her neck and arms with his claws. She was rescued by one of her sisters, after which her assailant fled.|$|E
2500|$|The Ancient Greeks and Romans {{believed}} the blood, excrement, rectum, genitalia, eyes, tongue, hair, skin, and fat, {{as well as}} the ash of different parts of the striped hyena's body, were effective means to ward off evil and to ensure love and fertility. The Greeks and Romans believed that the genitalia of a hyena [...] "would hold a couple peaceably together" [...] and that a hyena anus worn as an amulet on the upper arm would make its male possessor irresistible to women. [...] In West and South Asia, hyena body parts apparently {{play an important role in}} love magic and in the making of amulets. In Iranian folklore, it is mentioned that a stone found in the hyenas body can serve as a charm of protection for whoever wears it on his upper arm. In the Pakistani province of Sindh, the local Muslims place the tooth of a striped hyena over churns in order not to lose the milk's baraka. In Iran, a dried striped hyena pelt is considered a potent charm which forces all to succumb to the possessors attraction. In Afghanistan and Pakistan striped hyena hair is used either in love magic or as a charm in sickness. Hyena blood has been held in high regard in northern India as potent medicine, and the eating of the tongue helps fight tumors. In the Khyber area, burned striped hyena fat is applied to a man's genitals or sometimes taken orally to ensure virility, while in India the fat serves as a cure for rheumatism. In Afghanistan, some mullahs wear the vulva (kus) of a female striped hyena wrapped in silk under their armpits for a week. If a man peers through the vulva at the woman of his desire, he will invariably get <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> <b>her.</b> This has led to the proverbial expression in Dari of kus-e kaftar bay, as well as in Pashto of kus-e kaftar which literally mean [...] "it happens as smoothly as if you would look through the vulva of a female striped hyena". In the North-West Frontier Province and Baluchistan, the Pakhtun keep the vulva in vermilion powder, itself having aphrodesic connotations. The rectum of a freshly killed striped hyena is likewise used by homosexuals and bisexuals to attract young men. This has led to the expression [...] "to possess the anus of a [...] hyena" [...] which denotes somebody who is attractive and has many lovers. A striped hyena's penis kept in a small box filled with vermilion powder can be used for the same reasons.|$|E
