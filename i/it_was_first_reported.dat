5|$|Strobilomyces foveatus is {{a little-known}} species of fungus in the Boletaceae family. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>first</b> <b>reported</b> by mycologist E.J.H. Corner in 1972, from {{specimens}} he collected in Malaysia in 1959, {{and has since}} been found in Australia. Fruit bodies are characterized by the small dark brown to black conical scales covering the cap, and the net-like pattern of ridges on the upper stem. The roughly spherical spores measure about eight micrometres, and are densely covered with slender conical spines. The edibility of this species is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} S.thiersii grow during the mid or late summer until early fall. Since <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>first</b> <b>reported</b> in 1952 in Texas, this species has been {{expanding}} its range. It appeared in southern Illinois in the 1990s {{and has since}} spread to central Illinois, where {{it is the most}} common mushroom found in lawns during July and August. Today it occurs in nine states including Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas, Kentucky, Ohio, Kansas and Illinois. It also occurs in Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The breed is robustly healthy {{with few}} issues and adapts well to wet weather conditions. A {{dermatological}} condition known as acral mutilation and analgesia may affect French Spaniels. It is a newly recognised disorder, with symptoms becoming apparent {{between three and}} a half months and a year of age. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>first</b> <b>reported</b> in thirteen dogs in Canada and shares symptoms with the acral mutilation syndromes of the German Shorthaired Pointer, English Pointer and English Springer Spaniels. Dogs who are affected will lick, bite and mutilate their extremities resulting in ulcers with secondary bacterial infections. Self amputation of claws, digits and footpads can happen in extreme cases. The majority of the initial dogs identified were euthanised within days to months of being diagnosed.|$|E

5|$|Foreign spiders have colonised {{areas where}} {{suitable}} habitat remains. The major coloniser is the South African spider Steatoda capensis. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>first</b> <b>reported</b> in the 1990s {{and may have}} displaced the katipo along {{the west coast of}} the North Island from Wellington to Wanganui. Although both the katipo and S. capensis have been found sharing the same dune systems or even co-existing under the same piece of driftwood suggesting that the two species can co-exist in similar habitats. It is possible that the displacement of the katipo by S. capensis is due to its ability to recolonise areas from which the katipo had been displaced after storms or other dune modifications. Furthermore, S. capensis breeds year-round, produces more offspring and lives in a greater range of habitats which leads to greater pressure on the katipo. S. capensis also belongs to the family Theridiidae and shares many of the katipo's features. It is of similar size, shape, general coloration, it lacks the red stripe on its back, but may have some red, orange or yellow on its abdomen, as well as the general location where katipos are found. Due to these similarities it is commonly known in New Zealand as the ‘false katipo’.|$|E
5|$|The {{nominate}} population, {{especially in}} Africa, {{is known for}} its use of stones as tools. When a large egg, such as that of an ostrich or bustard, is located, the bird walks up to it with a large pebble held in its bill and tosses the pebble by swinging the neck down over the egg. The operation is repeated until the egg cracks from the blows. They prefer using rounded pebbles to jagged rocks. This behaviour, although it was believed that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>first</b> <b>reported</b> by Jane Goodall in 1966, it was actually already known to Africans and was first reported by J. G. Wood in 1877. However, this has only been reported in Africa and has not been recorded in N. p. ginginianus. Tests with both hand-reared and wild birds suggest that the behaviour is innate, not learnt by observing other birds, and displayed once they associate eggs with food and have access to pebbles. Another case of tool-use described from Bulgaria involves the use of a twig as a tool to roll up and gather strands of wool to use for lining the nest.|$|E

The Traube purine synthesis, an alternative method to synthesize theophylline, was introduced in 1900 by another German scientist, Wilhelm Traube. Theophylline's first clinical use came in 1902 as a diuretic. It took an additional 20 years until <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>first</b> <b>reported</b> as an asthma treatment.
