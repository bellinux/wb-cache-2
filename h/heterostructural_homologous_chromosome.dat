50|$|Chromosomes are linear {{arrangements}} of condensed deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and histone proteins, which form a complex called chromatin. <b>Homologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> {{are made up}} of chromosome pairs of approximately the same length, centromere position, and staining pattern, for genes with the same corresponding loci. One <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> is inherited from the organism's mother; the other is inherited from the organism's father. After mitosis occurs within the daughter cells, they have the correct number of genes which are a mix of the two parents' genes. In diploid (2n) organisms, the genome is composed of one set of each <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> pair, as compared to tetraploid organisms which may have two sets of each <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> pair. The alleles on the <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> may be different, resulting in different phenotypes of the same genes. This mixing of maternal and paternal traits is enhanced by crossing over during meiosis, wherein lengths of chromosomal arms and the DNA they contain within a <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> pair are exchanged with one another.|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} {{chromosome}} division of meiosis (MI), <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> pairs are separated, {{allowing for the}} production of fertile haploid gametes from diploid progenitor cells. Proper MI segregation of <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> in most eukaryotic organisms requires that at least one programmed DNA double-strand break (DSB) per pair of <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> is repaired as a crossover. These crossover events tether <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> together, which allows for the generation of a bipolar spindle to separate the <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> The widely conserved PCH 2 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is involved in regulating the repair of meiotic DSBs. First, Pch 2 promotes the use of the <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome,</b> instead of the sister chromatid, as a DSB repair template. Second, Pch 2 regulates the fate of DSBs that are repaired using the <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> by limiting gene conversion and by promoting crossover interference. pch 2 mutants repair a greater proportion of meiotic DSBs using the sister chromatid than wild-type cells, but the majority of DSBs are still repaired using the <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome.</b> The DSBs that are repaired using the <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> in pch 2 mutants have a higher likelihood to be associated with gene conversion events and to be repaired as crossovers, as opposed to noncrossovers. The distribution of crossover events observed in pch 2 also demonstrates a significant reduction in crossover interference in these mutants. I hypothesize that a single Pch 2 -dependent role in meiotic chromosome axis organization inhibits intersister DSB repair, limits gene conversion tract length, and promotes the interference regulation of interhomolog DSB repair...|$|R
50|$|In {{anaphase}} I of meiosis I the <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> {{are pulled}} apart from each other.

50|$|In {{prophase}} I of meiosis I, each chromosome is {{aligned with}} its homologous partner and pairs completely. In prophase I, the DNA has already undergone replication so each chromosome {{consists of two}} identical chromatids connected by a common centromere. During the zygotene stage of prophase I, the <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> pair up with each other. This pairing occurs by a synapsis process where the synaptonemal complex - a protein scaffold - is assembled and joins the <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> along their lengths. Cohesin crosslinking occurs between the <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> and helps them resist being pulled apart until anaphase. Genetic crossing over occurs during the pachytene stage of prophase I. In this process, genes are exchanged by the breaking and union of homologous portions of the chromosomes’ lengths. Structures called chiasmata are {{the site of the}} exchange. Chiasmata physically link the <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> once crossing over occurs and throughout the process of chromosomal segregation during meiosis. At the diplotene stage of prophase I the synaptonemal complex disassembles before which will allow the <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> to separate, while the sister chromatids stay associated by their centromeres.|$|R

40|$|AbstractPairing of <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> is {{important}} for homologous recombination and correct chromosome segregation during meiosis. It has been proposed that telomere clustering, nuclear oscillation, and recombination during meiotic prophase facilitate <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> pairing in fission yeast. Here we examined the contributions of these chromosomal events to <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> pairing, by directly observing the dynamics of chromosomal loci in living cells of fission yeast. Homologous loci exhibited a dynamic process of association and dissociation during {{the time course of}} meiotic prophase. Lack of nuclear oscillation reduced association frequency for both centromeric and arm regions of the chromosome. Lack of telomere clustering or recombination reduced association frequency at arm regions, but not significantly at centromeric regions. Our results indicate that <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> are spatially aligned by oscillation of telomere-bundled chromosomes and physically linked by recombination at chromosome arm regions; this recombination is not required for association of homologous centromeres...|$|R

25|$|Nondisjunction is {{the failure}} of <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> or sister chromatids to {{separate}} properly during cell division. There are three forms of nondisjunction: failure {{of a pair of}} <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> to separate in meiosis I, failure of sister chromatids to separate during meiosis II, and failure of sister chromatids to separate during mitosis. Nondisjunction results in daughter cells with abnormal chromosome numbers (aneuploidy).|$|R

Although a number of genes regulating <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> pairing and synapsis {{have been identified in}} the plant kingdom, their molecular basis remains poorly understood.

Two independent alleles, designated pair 3 - 1 and pair 3 - 2, were identified in our T-DNA insertional mutant library which could not form bivalents due to failure of <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> pairing and synapsis at diakinesis, resulting in sterility in both male and female gametes. Suppression of PAIR 3 by RNAi produced similar results to the T-DNA insertion lines.

40|$|International audienceRecombination is a {{prominent}} feature of meiosis {{in which it}} {{plays an important role}} in increasing genetic diversity during inheritance. Additionally, in most organisms, recombination also plays mechanical roles in chromosomal processes, most notably to mediate pairing of <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> during prophase and, ultimately, to ensure regular segregation of <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> when they separate at the first meiotic division. Recombinational interactions are also subject to important spatial patterning at both early and late stages. Recombination-mediated processes occur in physical and functional linkage with meiotic axial chromosome structure, with interplay in both directions, before, during, and after formation and dissolution of the synaptonemal complex (SC), a highly conserved meiosis-specific structure that links homolog axes along their lengths. These diverse processes also are integrated with recombination-independent interactions between <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> nonhomology-based chromosome couplings/clusterings, and diverse types of chromosome movement. This review provides an overview of these diverse processes and their interrelationships...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} the behaviour of centromeres and distal telomeres {{during the initial}} phases of female meiosis in mice. In particular, we wished to determine whether clustering of centromeres and telomeres (bouquet formation) played the same crucial role in <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> pairing in female meiosis {{as it does in}} the male. We found that synapsis (intimate <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> pairing) is most frequently initiated in the interstitial regions of <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> apparently ahead of the distal regions. The proximal ends of the chromosomes appear to be disfavoured for synaptic initiation. Moreover, initiation of synapsis occurred in oocytes that showed little or no evidence of bouquet formation. A bouquet was present in a substantial proportion of cells at mid to late zygotene, and was still present in some pachytene oocytes. This pattern of bouquet formation and pairing initiation is in stark contrast to that previously described in the male mouse. We propose that although dynamic movements of centromeres and telomeres to form clusters may facilitate alignment of homologues or <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> segments during zygotene, in the female mouse positional control of synaptic initiation is dependent on some other mechanism.
