Both men {{performed}} many offensive maneuvers {{through the}} match, but Mysterio gained the advantage when he kicked Finlay as <b>he</b> <b>hung</b> from the ropes, {{followed by a}} Leg drop, sending Finlay to ringside area and striking his head. In result of an injury, Finlay was stretchered out of the ring, and Mysterio followed. Finlay, however, got up and attacked Mysterio, ending the match in a no contest.|$|E
5|$|Forty {{years earlier}} than de Tournefort, de Thévenot {{described}} {{much the same}} process, adding that it was seldom used because it was regarded as too cruel. Some 80 years prior to de Thevenot, in 1579, Hans Jacob Breuning von Buchenbach witnessed {{a variant of the}} gaunching ritual. A large iron hook was fixed on the horizontal cross-bar of the gallows and the individual was forced upon this hook, piercing him from the abdomen through his back, so that <b>he</b> <b>hung</b> from it, hands, feet and head downward. On top of the cross bar, the executioner situated himself and performed various torture on the impaled man below him.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} {{passed from}} Haro into {{the collection of}} his daughter Catalina de Haro y Guzmán, the eighth Marchioness of Carpio, and her husband, Francisco Álvarez de Toledo, the tenth Duke of Alba. In 1802, Charles IV of Spain ordered the family to sell the painting (with other works) to Manuel de Godoy, his favourite and chief minister. <b>He</b> <b>hung</b> it alongside two masterpieces by Francisco Goya {{that he may have}} commissioned himself, The Nude Maja and The Clothed Maja. These bear obvious compositional similarities with Velázquez's Venus, although unlike Velázquez, Goya clearly painted his nude in a calculated attempt to provoke shame and disgust in the relatively unenlightened climate of 18th-century Spain.|$|E

5|$|The White House Chief of Staff, Donald Regan, grew {{frustrated}} with this regimen, which created friction {{between him and}} the First Lady. This escalated with the revelation of the Iran–Contra affair, an administration scandal, in which the First Lady felt Regan was damaging the president. She thought he should resign, and expressed this to her husband, although he did not share her view. Regan wanted President Reagan to address the Iran-Contra matter in early 1987 by means of a press conference, though Reagan refused to allow her husband to overexert himself due to a recent prostate surgery and astrological warnings. Regan became so angry with Reagan that <b>he</b> <b>hung</b> up on her during a 1987 telephone conversation. According to the recollections of ABC News correspondent Sam Donaldson, when the President heard of this treatment, he demanded—and eventually received—Regan's resignation. Vice President George H. W. Bush is also reported to have suggested to Reagan to have Regan fired.|$|E
5|$|Hines was traumatised by his {{experiences}} during World War I. For 40 years afterwards {{he lived in}} a humpy made of cloth bags near Mount Druitt on the outskirts of Sydney, and never married. The humpy was surrounded by a fence on which <b>he</b> <b>hung</b> helmets taken from German soldiers; he became well known to locals, though school children were afraid of him. Hines was unable to find consistent work, and lived on his Army pension as well as income from odd jobs and selling his souvenirs. He gained renewed fame when the photo of him at Polygon Wood was displayed at the temporary Australian War Museum in Sydney (the predecessor of the Australian War Memorial) from 1933, and several newspapers and magazines aimed at former servicemen published profiles of him. An article in the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia's magazine Reveille in 1934 highlighted Hines' desperate living conditions and stated that he had been unemployed for four years. Several former soldiers sent money to him in response to this article. Hines' pension was also doubled, though this income made him ineligible for relief work during the Great Depression. Despite his poverty, Hines travelled to Concord Repatriation Hospital each week to donate a suitcase of vegetables from his garden to the former soldiers being treated there.|$|E

25|$|As well as {{painting}} flat canvases, Klein {{produced a}} series of works throughout his career that blurred the edges between painting and sculpture. He appropriated plaster casts of famous sculptures, such as the Winged Victory of Samothrace and the Venus de Milo, by painting them International Klein Blue; he painted a globe, 3D reliefs of areas of France and dowels which <b>he</b> <b>hung</b> from the ceiling as rain; He also stuck sponges to canvases and painted dinner plates.

25|$|While his {{statistics}} {{attest to}} him being a genuine tailender, Edwards has helped save the West Indies three Test matches during his career, forming frustrating last wicket partnerships.

In 2006, Edwards remained at the crease for 36 balls at the Antigua Recreation Ground, with India unable to claim the final wicket, while in 2009 he prevented England from a win at the same ground by remaining unbeaten on five after 26 deliveries.|$|E

In the race he put intense pressure on Alonso and finished just two tenths of a second behind. Webber used a different strategy and moved through the field; he got past the McLarens and despite colliding with Hamilton midway through the race, <b>he</b> <b>hung</b> on to finish behind his team-mate in third.|$|E

He resumed his domestic cricket career after the war, and enjoyed a fine 1945/46 season when he took 47 wickets at 15.95, but after a couple of matches the following year <b>he</b> <b>hung</b> up his bat for good.|$|E

25|$|In 1898, on {{the advice}} of Camille Pissarro, he went to London to study the {{paintings}} of J. M. W. Turner and then went on a trip to Corsica. Upon his return to Paris in February 1899, he worked beside Albert Marquet and met André Derain, Jean Puy, and Jules Flandrin. Matisse immersed himself in the work of others and went into debt from buying work from painters he admired. The work <b>he</b> <b>hung</b> and displayed in his home included a plaster bust by Rodin, a painting by Gauguin, a drawing by van Gogh, and Cézanne's Three Bathers. In Cézanne's sense of pictorial structure and colour, Matisse found his main inspiration.|$|E

What the analysts who are gushing over Obama's sentiments regarding race relations are missing is not only did Obama fail to accomplish the mission he needed to, he didn't even really try. He made no attempt to explain his relationship with Wright and why <b>he</b> <b>hung</b> around a man who habitually offered such hateful rhetoric.
