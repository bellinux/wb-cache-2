40|$|On the {{assumption}} that the compensation for the topographic load is achieved in the manner of Airy-Heiskenenan hypothesis at a compensation depth of 30 kilometers, the spherical harmonic coefficients of the <b>isostatic</b> <b>reduction</b> potential U are computed. The degree power spectra of these coefficients are compared with the power spectra of the <b>isostatic</b> <b>reduction</b> coefficients given by Uotila. Results are presented in tabular form...|$|E
40|$|Professor Vening Meinesz (1887 - 1966), a Dutch geophysicist, {{undertook}} numerous submarine-expeditions {{to measure}} the gravity field of the Earth. The data here available have been digitised in a project of the Dutch Foundation for Academic Heritage. It contains 2 tables: - Table of Free-air and Isostatic Anomalies for all the Stations - Table of Effects of Topgraphy of Indirect <b>Isostatic</b> <b>Reduction</b> and of Compensation Tables are extracted from publications: - Gravity Expedition at Sea 1923 - 1939 Vol. IV.
