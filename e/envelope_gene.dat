In Buffalo rats that received plasmids carrying the HCV <b>envelope</b> <b>genes,</b> which encode <b>envelope</b> proteins E 1 and E 2, both antibody and lymphoproliferative responses against these proteins were induced. These responses were greatly enhanced by the codelivery of the GM-CSF gene.

40|$|AbstractIn a multisubtype {{approach}} to HIV- 1 vaccination, mice were immunized with HIV- 1 <b>envelope</b> gp 160 <b>genes</b> from subtypes A, B, and C. Subsequently the mice were challenged with syngeneic primary splenocytes infected with a HIV- 1 /MuLV pseudovirus carrying a subtype B genome. HIV-specific immune responses and protection were strongest {{in the group}} of animals immunized with a combination of subtype A, B, and C specific gp 160 genes as compared to subtype B only. Immunization with the combination of the cross-reactive subtypes A and C <b>envelope</b> <b>genes</b> induced HIV-specific immune responses but did not result in significant protection to challenge with subtype B infected cells. From this we conclude that immunization with the <b>envelope</b> <b>genes</b> from several HIV- 1 subtypes may indeed enhance immune responses. This study shows that by using a mix of subtype <b>envelope</b> <b>genes,</b> an enhanced protective immunity can be obtained experimentally, potentially also in humans...|$|R
40|$|Sequences of {{retroviral}} origin occupy approximately 8 % of {{the human}} genome. Most of these “retroviral” genes have lost their coding capacities since their entry into our ancestral genome millions of years ago, but some reading frames have remained open, suggesting positive selection. The complete sequencing {{of the human}} genome allowed a systematic search for retroviral <b>envelope</b> <b>genes</b> containing an open reading frame and resulted in the identification of 16 genes that we have characterized. We further showed, by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR using specifically devised primers which discriminate between coding and noncoding elements, that all 16 genes are expressed in at least some healthy human tissues, albeit at highly different levels. All <b>envelope</b> <b>genes</b> disclose significant expression in the testis, three of them have a very high level of expression in the placenta, and a fourth is expressed in the thyroid. Besides their primary role as key molecules for viral entry, the <b>envelope</b> <b>genes</b> of retroviruses can induce cell-cell fusion, elicit immunosuppressive effects, and even protect against infection, and as such, endogenous retroviral envelope proteins have been tentatively identified in several reports as being involved in both normal and pathological processes. The present study provides a comprehensive survey of candidate genes and tools for a precise evaluation of their involvement in these processes...|$|R

The results demonstrate that multiple regions of the HIV- 1 envelope glycoproteins are involved in syncytium formation. Some fragments, most notably those containing the V 2 or V 3 region, can transfer syncytium-inducing capacity to envelope proteins previously not capable of inducing syncytia. Moreover, it is shown that such regions functionally interact with other envelope regions, especially one encompassing the V 4 and V 5 regions of gp 120 or a region encompassing part of gp 41, to exert their function in membrane fusion...|$|R
40|$|To {{elucidate}} {{the evolution of}} cyanobacterial envelopes and the relation between gene content and environmental adaptation, cell envelope structures and components of unicellular and filamentous cyanobacteria were analyzed in comparative genomics. Hundreds of <b>envelope</b> biogenesis <b>genes</b> were divided into 5 major groups and annotated according to their conserved domains and phylogenetic profiles. Compared to unicellular species, the gene numbers of filamentous cyanobacteria expanded due to genome enlargement effect, but only few gene families amplified disproportionately, such as those encoding waaG and glycosyl transferase 2. Comparison of <b>envelope</b> <b>genes</b> among various species suggested that the significant variance of certain cyanobacterial <b>envelope</b> biogenesis <b>genes</b> should be the response to their environmental adaptation, which might be also related {{to the emergence of}} filamentous shapes with some new functions.

50|$|A recent {{evolutionary}} study {{based on}} 23 new full {{open reading frame}} sequences (near-complete genomes) found that the North American strains belonged to a single clade. Strains were isolated {{at different points in}} time (from 1933 to 2001) which allowed for the estimation of divergence times of SLE virus clades and the overall evolutionary rate. Furthermore, this study found an increase in the effective population size of the SLE virus around the end of the 19th century that corresponds to the split of the latest North American clade, suggesting a northwards colonization of SLE virus in the Americas. Scans for natural selection showed that most codons of the SLE virus ORF were evolving neutrally or under negative selection. Positive selection was statistically detected only at one single codon coding for amino acids belonging to the hypothesized N-linked glycosylation site of the envelope protein. Nevertheless, the latter can be due to selection in vitro (laboratory) rather than in vivo (host). In an independent study 14 out of 106 examined <b>envelope</b> <b>gene</b> sequences were found not to contain a specific codon at position 156 coding for this glycosylation site (Ser→Phe/Tyr).|$|E

We therefore constructed several wild-type and cell culture-adapted virus chimeras to examine the role of the <b>envelope</b> <b>gene</b> in replication in different cell types in vitro. Unlike wild-type virus, which is restricted by an early event(s) for replication in equine dermis cells, the wild-type outer <b>envelope</b> <b>gene</b> chimeras are replication competent in this cell type.

40|$|A {{variety of}} ecotropic murine leukemia viruses cause {{neurodegenerative}} disease. We describe here the clinical and histopathological {{features of a}} neurologic disease induced by a polytropic murine leukemia virus, FMCF 98. Clinical disease was dominated by hyperexcitability and ataxia, and the histopathology was char-acterized primarily by astrocytosis and astrocytic degeneration. The viral <b>envelope</b> <b>gene</b> harbored the deter-minants of neurovirulence, since the chimeric virus Fr 98 E, which contained the <b>envelope</b> <b>gene</b> of FMCF 98 on a background of the nonneurovirulent virus FB 29, caused a similar disease. The disease caused by Fr 98 E differed from that induced by the coisogenic neurovirulent ecotropic virus FrCasE in clinical presentation, histopathology, and distribution of virus in the central nervous system. Since Fr 98 E contains a polytropic <b>envelope</b> <b>gene</b> and FrCasE contains an ecotropic <b>envelope</b> <b>gene,</b> these phenotypic differences appeared {{to be determined by}} envelope sequences and may reflect differences in virus receptor usage in the central nervous system.

40|$|A {{member of}} the HERV-W family of human {{endogenous}} retroviruses (HERV) had previously been demonstrated to encode a functional envelope which can form pseudotypes with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 virions and confer infectivity on the resulting retrovirus particles. Here we show that a second envelope protein sorted out by a systematic search for fusogenic proteins that we made among all the HERV coding <b>envelope</b> <b>genes</b> and belonging to the HERV-FRD family can also make pseudotypes and confer infectivity. We further show that the orthologous <b>envelope</b> <b>genes</b> that were isolated from simians—from New World monkeys to humans—are also functional in the infectivity assay, with one singular exception for the gibbon HERV-FRD gene, which {{is found to be}} fusogenic in a cell-cell fusion assay, as observed for the other simian envelopes, but which is not infectious. Sequence comparison of the FRD envelopes revealed a limited number of mutations among simians, and one point mutation—located in the TM subunit—was shown to be responsible for the loss of infectivity of the gibbon envelope. The functional characterization of the identified envelopes is strongly indicative of an ancestral retrovirus infection and endogenization, with some of the envelope functions subsequently retained in evolution...|$|R

We compared three different animal models: guinea pigs, rabbits and cynomolgus macaques. <b>Envelope</b> <b>genes</b> from the prototype isolate HIV- 1 Bx 08 and two elite neutralizers were included. Codon-optimized genes, encoded secreted gp 140 or membrane bound gp 150, were modified for expression of stabilized soluble trimer gene products, and delivered individually or mixed. Specific IgG after repeated i. d. inoculations with electroporation confirmed in vivo expression and immunogenicity. Evaluations of rabbits and guinea pigs displayed similar results.

40|$|Friend murine spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) encodes a {{glycoprotein}} designated gp 52, {{which is}} responsible for the leukemogenic properties of the virus. gp 52 lacks a cytoplasmic domain and is defective in its transport to the cell surface.

However, unlike wild-type SFFV, the chimeric SFFV genome failed to induce erythroleukemia in adult mice.

Cells {{infected with the}} recombinant adenovirus which contained the large <b>envelope</b> <b>gene</b> (HS 1.

No HBV envelope proteins were detected in the culture medium from HS 1. HP-infected cells. Cells infected with recombinant adenovirus which contained the middle <b>envelope</b> <b>gene</b> (HS 2. HP) expressed and secreted the middle and major envelope proteins in a molar ratio of 3 : 1. Cells infected with the recombinant adenovirus which contained the major <b>envelope</b> <b>gene</b> (HS.

HP were assembled in 22 -nm particles, as shown by velocity sedimentation rate determination, buoyant densities, and electron microscopy. Cells coinfected with a recombinant adenovirus which contained the large <b>envelope</b> <b>gene</b> and with either HS 2. HP or HS. HP expressed similar quantities of the large, middle, and major envelope proteins in the cell lysates. Secretion of the major and middle envelope proteins was inhibited more than 95 % {{by the presence of}} the large envelope proteins. These results suggest that differential biosynthesis, transport, and processing of the envelope proteins occur during HBV infection, allowing efficient assembly and secretion of virions and hepatitis B surface antigen particles...|$|E
40|$|The genome of {{the human}} T-cell leukemia/lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) {{contains}} a functional gene denominated x-lor that may be important in HTLV-I transformation of human T cells. To study the role of x-lor and other HTLV-I genes in cellular transformation, we obtained a transformed nonproducer human T-cell line containing a single defective HTLV-I provirus (HTLV-I 55 /PL). This 7 -kilobase provirus had undergone a deletion involving the entire <b>envelope</b> <b>gene</b> and the nonconserved region. The point of the deletion corresponded to the junction of a donor splice site, located between the polymerase gene and the <b>envelope</b> <b>gene</b> (nucleotide 5183), and the acceptor site for the mRNA of the x-lor gene (nucleotide 7302). The juxtaposition of nucleotides 5182 and 7302 brings the initiating methionine codon of the <b>envelope</b> <b>gene</b> immediately 5 ' to the x-lor region, leaving the DNA sequence in frame for expression of a protein product. This finding suggests that a double splicing mechanism is used to express the x-lor gene, and that the defective provirus 55 /PL was generated through the reverse transcription of a partially spliced mRNA. Analysis of the x-lor mRNA of other HTLV-I-transformed cell lines revealed that a double splicing process is commonly used. Furthermore, since 55 /PL can be faithfully transmitted {{and is able to}} immortalize recipient T cells, we can conclude that the <b>envelope</b> <b>gene</b> is not necessary for in vitro transformation by HTLV-...|$|E

STCs were isolated and purified by using Percoll and specific immunoaffinity purification, respectively. The purified STCs were transfected with a plasmid carrying sequences of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) to create immortalized sheep trophoblast cell line (hTERT-STCs). hTERT-STCs showed a stable expression of hTERT gene, serially passaged for a year, and showed active proliferation without signs of senescence.

40|$|Friend {{murine leukemia}} virus (F-MuLV) and Friend mink cell focus-inducing virus (Fr-MCF) are helper-independent murine {{retrovirus}}es which induce a rapidly fatal erytholeukemia in NIH Swiss mice. Amphotropic clone 4070 (Ampho) is a murine retrovirus which does not cause leukemia in these animals. Mice inoculated with Ampho, an Fr-MCF/Ampho pseudotype, or F-MuLV developed leukemia in 0, 50, and 100 % of animals, respectively. To identify the F-MuLV and Fr-MCF sequences responsible for leukemia, we constructed hybrid viral genomes between these viruses and Ampho, using subgenomic fragments of molecularly cloned viral DNA. Transfection of these hybrid viral DNAs into fibroblasts produces recombinant retroviruses. These new viruses are assayed in vivo {{for their ability to}} cause leukemia. Recombinant viruses constructed between the Ampho genome and the Fr-MCF <b>envelope</b> <b>gene</b> do not cause leukemia. Similarly, viruses constructed by using either the Fr-MCF long terminal repeat U 3 region or the F-MuLV long terminal repeat U 3 region and the remainder of the Ampho genome do not cause leukemia. However, if the Fr-MCF <b>envelope</b> <b>gene</b> plus the Fr-MCF U 3 region are joined to Ampho, the resulting virus causes erythroleukemia in 14 % of mice. Recombinant viruses made between the Fr-MCF <b>envelope</b> <b>gene,</b> the F-MuLV U 3 region, and the remainder of the Ampho genome cause erythroleukemia in 38 % of mice.

To assess the suitability of such an approach, we determined the sensitivity of paediatric HIV- 1 subtype C viruses to the broadly neutralising MAbs IgG 1 b 12, 2 G 12, 2 F 5, and 4 E 10. The gp 160 <b>envelope</b> <b>genes</b> from seven children with HIV- 1 subtype C infection were cloned and used to construct Env-pseudotyped viruses that were tested in a single-cycle neutralisation assay. The epitopes defining three of these MAbs were determined from sequence analysis of the <b>envelope</b> <b>genes.</b> None of the seven HIV- 1 subtype C pseudovirions was sensitive to 2 G 12 or 2 F 5, which correlated with the absence of crucial N-linked glycans that define the 2 G 12 epitope and substitutions of residues integral to the 2 F 5 epitope. Four viruses were sensitive to IgG 1 b 12, and all seven viruses were sensitive to 4 E 10. Only 4 E 10 showed significant activity against HIV- 1 subtype C isolates, while 2 G 12 and 2 F 5 MAbs were ineffective and IgG 1 b 12 was partly effective.

40|$|Canine {{distemper}} virus (CDV) infects many carnivores, including ferrets and dogs, and is {{the member}} of the Morbillivirus genus most easily amenable to experimentation in a homologous small-animal system. To gain insights into the determinants of CDV pathogenesis, we isolated a strain highly virulent for ferrets by repeated passaging in these animals. Sequence comparison of the genome of this strain with that of its highly attenuated precursor revealed 19 mutations distributed almost evenly in the six genes. We then recovered a virus from a cDNA copy of the virulent CDV strain's consensus sequence by using a modified reverse genetics system based on B cells. We infected ferrets with this virus and showed that it fully retained virulence {{as measured by the}} timing of rash appearance, disease onset, and death. Body temperature, leukocyte number, lymphocyte proliferation activity, and cell-associated viremia also had similar kinetics. We then addressed the question of the relative importance of the envelope and other viral constituents for virulence. Viruses in which the <b>envelope</b> <b>genes</b> (matrix, fusion, and hemagglutinin) of the virulent strain were combined with the other genes of the attenuated strain caused severe rash and fever even if the disease onset was delayed.
