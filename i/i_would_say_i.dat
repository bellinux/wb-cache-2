500|$|Tarwater {{was raised}} in a Christian home, but growing up he [...] "sort of went through the motions" [...] and didn't really hold strong beliefs. By college, he had {{abandoned}} any pretense of faith. [...] He later said that [...] "the Olympics had become an idol in my life." [...] After not making the Olympics in 2008, he met Doug Banister who challenged Tarwater to re-examine his worldview. [...] "The 'A-ha' moments were many," [...] Tarwater later recalled. [...] "y the time I had the ability to prayerfully repent and rebuke the stuff in my life, I was finally at a good time in life.... <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> recommitted my life because I grew up in a Christian home, but really {{it was the first time}} where I knew what I was doing and committed my life to Christ." [...] Tarwater credits his Christian faith for helping him get through the ups and downs of being a competitive swimmer. On his 2012 Olympic experience, he said [...] "It was a real gift from God. [...] I felt His presence so much the past few weeks. [...] It was an unbelievable feeling." [...] Tarwater attends Hope Community Church in Charlotte.|$|E
2500|$|Tutu {{came out}} in support of {{assisted}} dying on July 2014, stating that life shouldn't be preserved [...] "at any cost". He also said that laws that deny the right to assisted dying deprive those who are dying of their [...] "human right to dignity". He gave the example of Nelson Mandela, whose long and painful illness was in his opinion [...] "an affront to Madiba's dignity". Tutu stated that {{in a similar situation}} he would not want to have his own life [...] "prolonged artificially", saying [...] "I {{think a lot of people}} would be upset if I said I wanted assisted dying. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't mind actually." ...|$|E

5000|$|After the Ravens won Super Bowl XLVII, Birk {{chose not}} to attend the celebratory meeting with President Barack Obama, saying [...] "I wasn't there. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> this, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that <b>I</b> {{have great respect for}} the office of the presidency, but about five or six weeks ago, our {{president}} made a comment in a speech and he said, 'God bless Planned Parenthood.' Planned Parenthood performs about 330,000 abortions a year. I am Catholic, I am active in the pro-life movement and I just felt like I couldn't deal with that. I couldn't endorse that in any way." ...|$|R
2500|$|Meyer {{decided to}} include the {{pregnancy}} in her story while she was researching vampires, early in 2003, and came across {{the legend of the}} incubus, a demon who could father children. Bella's insistence to not let her child die was inspired by Meyer's reaction when asked if she would let one of her children die so she could live, which was to deliver the child no matter what the consequences were. Meyer {{said in an interview with}} Shannon Hale, published in , that the birth scene published is a little less grotesque than the one she wrote before editing due to her editor, agent and publisher's requests to [...] "tone down the violence a little". She stated that Bella's pregnancy and childbirth, for her, were [...] "a way to kind of explore that concept of what childbirth used to be" [...] in the past and acknowledged that they were [...] "taking Bella in a new direction that wasn't [...] relatable for a lot of people." [...] Concerning the subject of the relatability of Bella, Meyer admitted that she lost some of her relatability to the character when she became a vampire and said, [...] "every point up until that point in the story [...] <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> could step into this story right here and I could do everything she could do which made it really fun." [...] Meyer wanted to experience Bella's vampiric experiences and [...] "enjoyed very much" [...] writing about them and wanted to end the book from her perspective, but still thought it was [...] "a little bit harder" [...] as she couldn't step in into the story anymore.|$|E

But you will need much money, and as it is evident money will not be plentiful, so I must do my part in helping you. Because this {{establishment}} and our mode of life here is expensive, while it will please my father to be near the scene of operations, we will let High Maples and retire to a mountain ranch.

60|$|WISE. What? Why <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> <b>I</b> hope no good man, no man of good conscience, no {{man that}} either feareth God, regardeth the credit of religion, {{the peace of}} God's people, or the {{salvation}} of his own soul, will do thus. Professors such, perhaps, there may be, and who upon earth can help it? Jades there be of all colours. If men will profess, and make their profession a stalking-horse to beguile their neighbours of their estates, as Mr. Badman himself did, when he beguiled her that now is with sorrow his wife, who can help it? The churches of old were pestered with such, and therefore no marvel if these perilous difficult times be so. But mark how the apostle words it: 'Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren. Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived, neither fornicators, nor idolators, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God' (1 Cor 6:8-10; 2 Tim 3:1-5).|$|E

I long for no pomps and vanities. I will promise you this moment, if you will, never to {{re-enter}} a heathen temple--to hide {{my face in the}} dust whenever I approach a woman. But I must--I must see the world; I must see the great mother-church in Alexandria, and the patriarch, and his clergy. If they can serve God in the city, why not I? I could do more for God there than here .... Not that I despise this work--not that I am ungrateful to you--oh, never, never that!--but I pant for the battle. Let me go! I am not discontented with you, but with myself. I know that obedience is noble; but danger is nobler still. If you have seen the world, why should not I? If you have fled from it because you found it too evil to live in, why should not I, and return to you here of my own will, never to leave you? And yet Cyril and his clergy have not fled from it....' ...|$|E
60|$|So {{he withdrew}} from me, {{and then came}} several of the justice's {{servants}} to me, {{and told me that}} I stood so much upon a nicety.
