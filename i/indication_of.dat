40|$|The <b>indications</b> <b>of</b> acupoints {{are thought}} to be highly {{associated}} with the lines of the meridian systems. The present study used data mining methods to analyze the characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>indications</b> <b>of</b> each acupoint and to visualize the relationships between the acupoints and disease sites in the classic Korean medical text Chimgoogyeongheombang. Using a term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) scheme, the present study extracted valuable data regarding the <b>indications</b> <b>of</b> each acupoint according to the frequency of the cooccurrences of eight Source points and eighteen disease sites. Furthermore, the spatial patterns <b>of</b> the <b>indications</b> <b>of</b> each acupoint on a body map were visualized according to the tf-idf values. Each acupoint along the different meridians exhibited different constellation patterns at various disease sites. Additionally, the spatial patterns <b>of</b> the <b>indications</b> <b>of</b> each acupoint were highly associated with the route of the corresponding meridian. The present findings demonstrate that the <b>indications</b> <b>of</b> each acupoint were primarily associated with the corresponding meridian system. Furthermore, these findings suggest that the routes of the meridians may have clinical implications in terms of identifying the constellations <b>of</b> the <b>indications</b> <b>of</b> acupoints...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This study {{explores the}} {{applicability}} of a multi-attribute decision-making method in assessing Guizhi Decoction (GZD) and its varieties {{as noted in the}} Shanghanlun. Methods: A known multi-attribute decision-making method, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), was adopted to transform the clinical challenge of selecting optional decoction for a given combination of symptoms or signs into multiple criteria decision-making problem. Results: A normative model based on the AHP was realized for <b>indications</b> <b>of</b> GZD and its varieties. The <b>indications</b> <b>of</b> sub-family GZD-f (<b>indications</b> <b>of</b> GZD itself) were exterior illness; the <b>indications</b> <b>of</b> GZD-vf 1 (<b>indications</b> <b>of</b> GZD’s variants which consist of fine adjustments to the ingredients or content on the basis of GZD) were exterior illness with interior excess, suggesting that GZD-vf 1 consisted of most conservative variants <b>of</b> GZD; the <b>indications</b> <b>of</b> both GZD-vf 2 (<b>indications</b> <b>of</b> Guizhi Qu Shaoyao Decoction and its derivative variants) and GZD-vf 3 (<b>indications</b> <b>of</b> Guizhi Gancao Decoction and its derivative variants) showed evolution from exterior illness to interior deficiency in 2 directions. As to efficacy evaluation of the decoction, GZD and its varieties (restricted to those comparable ones) were of equal efficacy on 3 popular signs or symptoms indicating exterior illness: floating pulse, aversion to wind and spontaneous sweating, which were the common ground <b>of</b> <b>indications</b> for the GZD family. Conclusion: Modeling of diagnostic procedure based on the AHP is proved practicable to analyze the clinical judgment system of traditional Chinese medicine. Quantification research on syndrome differentiation and decoction evaluation system focused on signs and symptoms is suggested as a feasible and reliable model...|$|R

The campaign took place in 266 or 267 and was aimed directly at Ctesiphon; Odaenathus reached the walls of the Persian capital but had to cancel the siege and march north to face the influx of Germanic riders attacking Anatolia.|$|E

Flooding was observed in portions of the city, and the West Rigolets Lighthouse on Lake Pontchartrain suffered $5,000 in damage due to the storm (1868USD, $81,000 2010USD). The storm accelerated northeastward and struck near Apalachicola, Florida late on October4.|$|E
5|$|An <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the army's high esteem for barbarian-born troops is {{that they}} appear to have been {{preferentially}} recruited to the elite units of the late imperial era's armies.

From the late 3rd century onwards, barbarian recruitment became crucial to the army's continued existence, by providing a much-needed source of first-rate recruits.|$|E
5|$|An unusual {{element is}} that the tale draws its {{characters}} from essentially the same cast as Táin Bó Cuailnge, making mention of some thirty heroes from that narrative, yet never once mentions Cú Chulainn.

Some of the rhetorical verse elements are old and obscure, but certain seemingly parodic elements of the genre at least suggest a later composition of the present form.|$|E

5|$|At an {{estimated}} , IK Pegasi B {{is considered to}} be a high-mass white dwarf. Although its radius has not been observed directly, it can be estimated from known theoretical relationships between the mass and radius of white dwarfs, giving a value of about 0.60% of the Sun's radius. (A different source gives a value of 0.72%, so there remains some uncertainty in this result.) Thus this star packs a mass greater than the Sun into a volume roughly the size of the Earth, giving an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> this object's extreme density.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the kingdom}} was {{largely based on}} agriculture, the {{construction}} of irrigation works was a major achievement of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, ensuring water supply in the dry zone and helping the country grow mostly self-sufficient. Several kings, most notably Vasabha and Mahasena, built large reservoirs and canals, which created a vast and complex irrigation network in the Rajarata area throughout the Anuradhapura period. These constructions are an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the advanced technical and engineering skills used to create them. The famous paintings and structures at Sigiriya; the Ruwanwelisaya, Jetavana stupas, and other large stupas; large buildings like the Lovamahapaya; and religious works (like the numerous Buddha statues) are landmarks demonstrating the Anuradhapura period's advancement in sculpting.|$|E
