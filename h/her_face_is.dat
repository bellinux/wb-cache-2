5|$|File:Elizabeth_Poulett_by_Robert_Peake.jpg| Elizabeth Poulett, 1616. The sitter wears a jewelled and {{feathered}} caul, a type {{of indoor}} headdress. The spot on <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> a fashionable patch of velvet or silk, glued to her skin.|$|E
5|$|The {{first episode}} starts with Kills furiously {{walking with a}} {{revolver}} in direction of a blonde man; she later ties him up on a bed, as he screams and tries to resist. Kills calls a friend whose name is not revealed, and asks him for help. During the second episode, Kills assassinates another man and takes his photograph; the next episode, she is arrested by a group—played by Far East Movement—who threaten her. She manages to strangle {{the leader of the}} group, and later leaves a message for her anonymous friend, warning him that <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> being distributed on wanted posters.|$|E
5|$|Velázquez {{uses this}} light {{not only to}} add volume and {{definition}} to each form but also to define the focal points of the painting. As the light streams in from the right it brightly glints on the braid and golden hair of the female dwarf, who is nearest the light source. But because <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> turned from the light, and in shadow, its tonality {{does not make it}} a point of particular interest. Similarly, the light glances obliquely on the cheek of the lady-in-waiting near her, but not on her facial features. Much of her lightly coloured dress is dimmed by shadow. The Infanta, however, stands in full illumination, and with her face turned towards the light source, even though her gaze is not. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> framed by the pale gossamer of her hair, setting her apart from everything else in the picture. The light models the volumetric geometry of her form, defining the conic nature of a small torso bound rigidly into a corset and stiffened bodice, and the panniered skirt extending around her like an oval candy-box, casting its own deep shadow which, by its sharp contrast with the bright brocade, both emphasises and locates the small figure as the main point of attention.|$|E
60|$|PHOEBE. It <b>was</b> raining and <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> wet. You {{said you}} did it because <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> wet.|$|R
50|$|<b>Her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> filthy and unwashed.|$|R
60|$|Mademoiselle {{shook her}} head. Indeed <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> {{sufficient}} answer.|$|R
5|$|The central {{feature of}} the {{monument}} depicts the theme {{of a young man}} called from civil life to serve his nation in a time of need and it transforms the theme into a contemporary allegory. It captures the decisive moment as farmer is caught mid-transition, with his left hand still on the plow handle, and taking the sword with his right hand from Liberty. The details of the farmer includes realistic work clothes, a yoked shirt with rolled sleeves and work trousers tucked into his boots. Liberty, identified by her Phrygian cap, stands just above the farmer in classical robes with a breastplate, sandals and cloak. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> impassive as she bestows the sword upon the farmer with her left hand while her right hand holds her pike.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a closeup shot of Katy's face, {{surrounded}} by alternating red and blue lights, as she mouths the song's lyrics. It then changes to a mechanics' shop, where two young men are seen sitting, looking to the ground. Shots of sparks then appear in the screen, which emerge from a car. Katy {{is sitting on the}} automobile's passenger seat, while looking to her love interest, who is repairing the car, seemingly worried. She is later seen being driven by her boyfriend's group in that car. Her boyfriend is seen lying on a bed, and looking at the mirror, looking distantly. The car seen before finally arrives in a car parking lot where other cars are driving in circles. They exit their cars while others start driving again. The video's final scenes take place at the car parking lot, while the cars keep driving, with shots of women and other men sitting on the cars. The visual finally closes with a similar shot to that seen in the beginning, of Katy's face surrounded by lights, though now, <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> mixed with her love interest's.|$|E
25|$|In Pre-Raphaelite art, Helen {{is often}} shown with shining curly hair and ringlets. Other {{painters}} {{of the same}} period depict Helen on the ramparts of Troy, and focus on her expression: <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> expressionless, blank, inscrutable. In Gustave Moreau's painting, Helen will finally become faceless; a blank eidolon {{in the middle of}} Troy's ruins.|$|E
60|$|Now when Noie {{translated}} {{these words}} to <b>her,</b> the <b>face</b> {{of the old}} queen was filled with horror, and as <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was,</b> so <b>was</b> Noie's <b>face.</b>|$|R
60|$|Betty had whipped round again. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> {{white with}} excitement.|$|R
60|$|Irene turned, <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> deadly pale, <b>her</b> eyes burning dark.|$|R
25|$|In the {{painting}} generally titled The Lady with an Ermine (about 1483) {{he sets the}} figure diagonally to the picture space and turns her head so that <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> almost parallel to her nearer shoulder. The {{back of her head}} and the further shoulder are deeply shadowed. Around the ovoid solid of her head and across her breast and hand the light is diffused {{in such a way that}} the distance and position of the light in relation to the figure can be calculated.|$|E
25|$|The Piraeus Athena {{is often}} {{mentioned}} to seem approachable by the scholar, Neer. This {{serves as a}} stark contrast from the Archaic style, where gods were often depicted as stern according to Neer One reason Athena here is perceived approachable is due to her stance. The Piraeus Athena, here is in contrapposto stance, meaning that her left leg is more relaxed, while she is putting her weight on the right leg. This position portrays {{the idea that she}} is almost stooping towards the mortal viewer. The passive and gentle expression on <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> also denoted with an air of approachability according.|$|E
25|$|The woman appears {{simultaneously}} clothed and unclothed in an {{interplay of}} transparencies, visual, tactile, and motor spaces, evoking {{a series of}} mind-associations between past present and future not atypical of Metzinger's earlier works. Her left breast is seen both from the front and from the side simultaneously. Her pose is elegant. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> eminently stylized, her neck is tubiform, her hair almost realistic in appearance as if combed onto the canvas; her shoulders, decidedly cubic from which emanate long slender arms superimposed with geometric elements that compose the background. Depth of field is practically non-present. Blues, whites and reds dominate the composition. Greens and ochers serve to delineate elements in the foreground (arms, leg, table).|$|E
60|$|He {{held her}} unresisting hand, but <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> hidden from him.|$|R
60|$|Ozma made {{no reply}} at once. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> grave and thoughtful.|$|R
60|$|Saxon chilled, and <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> grave; but Mercedes Higgins rattled on.|$|R
25|$|The couple {{appears to}} {{want the same}} thing, but Jonathan soon reveals his dark side. The shirt was the last keepsake Bianca had of Miranda. However, Bianca is given a miracle when Miranda turns out alive. Maggie is elated, but Jonathan is {{disturbed}} by it all. When Bianca is at the brink of death after a fall from a deck due to a scuffle with JR, Jonathan, who {{is aware of the}} incident, does not tell Maggie. During a heated argument with him about it, after she discovers his deception, Jonathan loses his calm and slaps her. Maggie stays quiet about the physical altercation, and claims that the bruise on <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> due to a gym accident. The slap by Jonathan is only the beginning of his abuse of her.|$|E
25|$|Jean Grey {{appears in}} , voiced by Yurika Hino and voiced again by Jennifer Hale in the English distribution. At the {{beginning}} of the series, she is consumed by the Phoenix Force and nearly destroys the world with her tremendous strength and power. The X-Men engage in a brief battle with her, until she ultimately sacrifices herself to save the world. Although she apparently dies, she assists the X-Men with conflicts through a strong telepathic link in later episodes, such as saving Professor X from hallucinations, and appears as the White Phoenix of the Crown, encouraging the X-Men to keep on fighting to save the world. She was in a strong and close romantic relationship with Cyclops, and had a necklace with a ruby stone with gold {{in the shape of a}} phoenix, which was a gift from Cyclops. The necklace was then given to Hisako as a sign that Cyclops can finally let Jean go, as he recognizes her sacrifice as a symbol of love for her friends and the world. Her Dark Phoenix persona is taken from X-Men: The Last Stand where <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> full of dark veins and her eyes become entirely black.|$|E
25|$|To the Pennimans {{were born}} four children; Hortensia, who married Judge Brayton of Swanton; Udney, who {{inherited}} the homestead in Colchester; Julietta, who married Dr. Nathan Ryno Smith, a physician of Baltimore; and Adelia, {{who became the}} wife of Dr. Moody, {{one of the early}} physicians of Burlington. Two daughters of Adelia were well known in Burlington, Mrs. Mary M. Howe, and Mrs. Ella M. Goodrich, wife of Prof. E. Goodrich. Penniman’s descendants had in their possession some interesting Allen relics, but two beautiful old Copley portraits of Penniman and her mother, Mrs. Crean Brush, passed into the possession of Mr. Pell, the owner of Ft. Ticonderoga. They were painted in New York in 1771, when Frances was eleven years of age. She is quaintly arrayed in a long bodice and long full skirt with her hair pompadoured and powdered like her mother’s. But <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> strikingly bright and expressive. She holds in one slender hand a basket of flowers, a prophetic hint of that taste that brought her so much satisfaction when she became middle-aged. A Female Academy was started in Middlebury, Vermont in 1802, and Mrs. Emma Willard began the Middlebury Female Seminary there in 1811. It was to her school, first in Middlebury and then in Troy (Emma Willard School), that Adelia Penniman was sent for her education.|$|E
60|$|She didn't {{appear to}} hear, and <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> dark with passion.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} him strangely, and <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> white with pain.|$|R
60|$|She {{was looking}} at him open-eyed. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> white and shocked.|$|R
25|$|On December 23, 2005, it {{is shown}} (to the audience) that Dixie did indeed survive the {{automobile}} accident that {{was thought to}} have claimed her life {{while she was in}} Europe. Di, the only one who knows that Dixie is alive, goes to visit her, and urges her to return to Pine Valley and let her family know that she is alive. Dixie seems adamant on not taking Di's advice at first, but soon returns to Pine Valley in February 2006. She attends the Mardi Gras ball thrown by Erica Kane. Because <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> hidden by a mask, no one from her family recognizes her. She does, however, witness a tender moment between Tad and Di, as well as JR and Babe. Janet Dillon rigs the hot water heater at the mansion where the ball is being held so that it will explode. When it does, many people die and are injured and Dixie is trapped by some rubble. She manages to escape without being discovered by anyone. She goes to Wildwind, where Di is staying. In the middle of confronting her sister, Tad arrives and Dixie runs off before he can see her. Later, she runs into Zach Slater, and he promises not to reveal {{the fact that she is}} still alive. Later, she secretly watches in horror as her son holds a gun to Krystal Carey at a cabin, demanding to know where his ex-wife, Babe, has taken their son. Dixie hides as Tad arrives and tries to wrestle the gun away from JR, but the gun goes off and hits Dixie (who is outside) in the arm. It is soon revealed that Tad and Dixie's baby, Kate, is in fact alive, but was taken by Dr. Greg Madden, a famous surgeon who is hated by virtually everyone in Pine Valley. A few months earlier, Tad had informed Erica that Greg stole her baby, the one she aborted twenty-something years ago, and Erica's son is also alive, going by the name Josh Madden.|$|E
500|$|Nefertiti {{has become}} an icon of Berlin's culture. Some 500,000 {{visitors}} see Nefertiti every year. The bust is described as [...] "the best-known work of art from ancient Egypt, arguably from all antiquity". <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> on postcards of Berlin and 1989 German postage stamps.|$|E
500|$|Edith Scob as Christiane Génessier, Doctor Génessier's daughter. Christiane's {{face was}} damaged {{in a car}} {{accident}} caused by her father. For most of the film, <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> covered by a stiff mask that resembles her face before the accident. Like Brasseur, Scob was also cast by Franju in La Tête Contre les Murs, but in a [...] minor role. Scob later worked with Franju on four other films.|$|E
60|$|Estella {{bent over}} her dishes in silence. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> deadly white.|$|R
60|$|Maud seated herself quietly between them. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> {{grave and}} thoughtful.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> a {{sufficient}} answer, and he drew {{her down to}} him.|$|R
500|$|I went to New York to meet (Madonna), begrudgingly, {{and showed}} up at an address at SoHo, {{which turned out to}} be a squat basically. Madonna was scantily clad, working out to a massive disco track. She was charismatic. She kept putting her head down on the table and talking to me, very flirtatious, and that gave me the idea for the scene in [...] "burning up", where <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> on the road, and the camera's really low and close.|$|E
500|$|Helena Bonham Carter as Dr. Serena Kogan / Skynet: an ex-Cyberdyne {{scientist}} who convinces Marcus to donate his body for her research. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> later {{used by the}} Skynet computer to communicate with Marcus. Tilda Swinton was originally considered for the part, but Bonham Carter replaced her before filming. She accepted the part because her then-domestic partner, Tim Burton, was a Terminator fan. Her role was a [...] "small but pivotal" [...] one and would only require ten days of shooting. However, on July 20, 2008, Bonham Carter delayed filming by a day, and was given an indefinite leave due {{to the death of}} four of her family members in a minibus accident in South Africa.|$|E
500|$|In the video's conclusion, Gaga's {{silhouette}} struts in {{an alley}} in a tribute to Jackson's [...] "The Way You Make Me Feel" [...] video. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> misconstrued, with sharp horns protruding from her face, glowing eyes, uneven hair, and a distinct Madonna-esque gap between her front teeth. Gaga has commented that she was teased as kids would call her [...] "rabbit teeth". She sheds a single tear as the pink triangle frame appears again, and inside it, a silhouette of Gaga sitting atop the unicorn. A city and a rainbow appear in the background, and Gaga is seen in her zombie makeup, chewing bubble gum and blowing it, as the pink triangle zooms away.|$|E
60|$|But Groa {{stood looking}} {{after him and}} <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> fierce and evil.|$|R
60|$|She shivered all over. She {{looked at}} him, <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> {{suddenly}} strained.|$|R
60|$|She {{turned toward}} him, and the {{moonlight}} showed <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> reassuringly quiet.|$|R
