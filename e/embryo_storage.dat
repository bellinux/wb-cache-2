40|$|OBJECTIVE: Cryopreservation of {{supernumerary}} embryos {{resulting from}} IVF treatment offers extra chances to conceive. The {{objective of this}} study is to describe patients' decisions to continue or discontinue storage of their embryos after a minimum storage period of 2 years. METHODS: Female patients who had embryos stored at the Infertility Centre of the Ghent University Hospital (Belgium) were sent a mail questionnaire to be completed anonymously. RESULTS: The questionnaire had a response rate of 79 % (326 / 412). After an <b>embryo</b> <b>storage</b> period of at least 2 years, 40 % of the couples who were still together wished to continue storage of their embryos. Half of these had no concrete plans for a transfer and wanted to postpone the decision or keep all options open. For those who decided to discontinue storage (60 %), the main reason was the completion of their families. Despite the fact that the patients' child wish was the main factor in their storage decision, two groups of patients with distinct profiles made decisions that were inconsistent with their child wish: those who wanted to continue storage while not wanting a(nother) child (7 % of those with no child wish), and those who wanted a(nother) child but decided to discontinue storage (25 % of those with a child wish). Overall, these patients more often expressed emotional difficulties regarding this decision.

40|$|To whom do {{sperm and}} ova belong? Few tissues are {{produced}} by the human body with more waste than the germ cells. Yet dominion over the germ cells, and over the early embryo that results from their union in vitro, is behind much of the emotion that modern reproductive intervention can engender. The germ cells differ from other human tissues that can be donated or transplanted because they carry readily utilizable genetic information. Eventual expression of the germ cells' genetic potential is the legitimate concern and responsibility of their donors, although in the right circumstances the responsibility can by agreement be entrusted to institutions administering gamete or embryo donor programmes; these institutions, in turn, may need to assume responsibility for decisions if, {{in the case of}} <b>embryo</b> <b>storage,</b> the wishes of the two donors conflict. The fact of sperm and ovum ownership (and the genetic potential that goes with it) before individuals part with these tissues is beyond dispute.

40|$|An {{encapsulation}} {{protocol to}} obtain synthetic seeds {{was established in}} Catharanthus roseus (L.) G. Don. Hypocotyl derived embryogenic callus containing somatic embryos viz., torpedo, early cotyledonary and cotyledonary were encapsulated in sodium alginate and calcium chloride solution. Sodium alginate acts as an artificial endosperm, providing nourishment to the growing embryos, {{at the same time}} it protects embryos from damages and facilitates embryos germination later. Different levels of sodium alginate and calcium chloride were used in which perfect bead formation was observed in condition encapsulated with 2. 5 % sodium alginate and 100 mM calcium chloride solution. Calcium chloride exposure for 15 min improved bead quality by forming uniform and firm beads. Addition of 3 % sucrose to sodium alginate solution was also very effective for synthetic seed germination.

40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{germination}} of excised embryos can break dormancy rapidly and shorten {{the time required}} to produce seedlings, speeding up olive breeding programmes as well as rootstock production. In this study, the in vitro germination potential of four Sicilian olive cultivars was evaluated during two years of experiments, using explants with three different morphological configurations that represent three different degrees of embryo exposure: (1) intact stoneless seeds containing the embryo, the endosperm and the seed coat (Emb+En+SC), (2) seeds without the seed coat (Emb+En) and (3) naked, isolated embryos (seed coat and endosperm both removed: Emb). Differences were found in the germination percentages and timing due to both genotype and explant type. The root and shoot meristems, the radicle-hypocotyl axis, the provascular tissues and <b>embryo</b> <b>storage</b> reserves were identified as embryo anatomical structures which could influence germination capacity. Observation of these structures, however, indicated similar germination potential among cultivars, suggesting possible differences in other dormancy factors. In spite of variation in cultivar performance, after 60 days of in vitro culture all cultivars demonstrated the highest germination of naked embryos (explant type 3) and lowest for stoneless seeds (explant type 1); stoneless seeds without the seedcoat (explant type 2) showed intermediate germination percentages.

40|$|There are {{substantial}} numbers of frozen <b>embryos</b> in <b>storage</b> {{that will not be}} used by those who produced them for their own fertility treatment. One option for such embryos is to donate them to others to use in their fertility treatment. There has been considerable debate about how this process should be organized. In the US, there are embryo adoption programmes that mediate between those relinquishing embryos and potential recipients. This is a form of conditional embryo donation, where the relinquishing couple can choose the recipient of their embryo. This article examines the ethical debate over conditional embryo donation for family building and explores the question of whether those who have unused frozen embryos should be able to determine who receives their embryos. The main objections to conditional embryo donation are examined: first, the embryo is not a person and therefore such concern over the placement of an embryo is unwarranted; secondly, potential donors might impose morally problematic conditions on who should receive their embryo; and thirdly, there are practical difficulties regarding organizational arrangements and the associated costs involved. It will be concluded that these objections can be countered and that if people wish to donate and receive embryos in this way there is no ethical objection to them doing so...|$|R
40|$|The main aims were to {{investigate}} emotional reactions during {{in vitro fertilization}} (IVF) treatment among women and men, attitudes of IVF couples towards cryopreserved embryos and public attitudes towards various aspects of oocyte donation in Sweden. Assessments of emotional, physical and social reactions were made on a daily reaction scale and attitudes {{on the basis of}} study-specific questionnaires. Both women and men experienced the stages of oocyte retrieval and embryo transfer, as well as the luteal phase, as being particularly stressful and there was a similarity in the type of reaction pattern. Presence of supernumerary embryos for cryopreservation increased the women’s optimism, but did not seem to reduce their level of distress on the day of embryo transfer. One-third of IVF couples chose not to use their cryopreserved embryos. The main reasons among the respondents concerned family planning and too short a legally allowed time of <b>embryo</b> <b>storage.</b> There was strong support for oocyte donation among a subset of the Swedish population. Women were more positive than men towards oocyte donation and to disclosure of the origin to offspring. Factors that might increase the likelihood of women becoming oocyte donors were talking to women with experience of donating oocytes, proximity to the clinic, accessibility of counselling and having children of their own. These results indicate that different approaches to psychological care for women and men may not be warranted during IVF treatment. Contact should be maintained during the cryopreservation period in order to adress the couple’s questions and concerns about the embryos. To increase the donor pool, IVF clinics could provide information about donation to potential donors through the Internet and through experienced donors. The information to donors and recipient couples about different consequences of donation seems to be of great importance...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In 2004, a law {{regulating}} {{assisted reproduction}} techniques (ART) {{was passed in}} Italy. The new rules allow for the formation and transfer of a maximum of three embryos at one time, whereas embryo selection and <b>embryo</b> <b>storage</b> are prohibited. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the impact of these restrictions on ICSI outcome in couples affected by severe male factor infertility. METHODS: Thirteen Italian ART Units were involved in this study. Data were collected on ICSI cycles performed during 2 years before (control group) and 2 years after (study group) the enforcement of the law. Only cases of obstructive azoospermia (OA), non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) and severe oligoastenoteratozoospermia (OAT) (sperm count <or= 1 x 10 (6) per ml; normal forms <or= 5 % according to WHO) were included. Laboratory results (fertilization rate, cleavage rate and embryo quality) and clinical outcomes (clinical pregnancy rate, implantation rate, abortion rate) were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: One thousand six hundred and forty ICSI cycles were examined. The control group included 843 cycles (51. 4 %), whereas the study group consisted in 797 cycles (48. 6 %). The restrictions imposed by the law significantly reduced the number of good-morphology embryos available for transfer (57. 5 versus 50. 1 %; P < 0. 001). In addition, the clinical pregnancy rate (32. 6 versus 22. 6 %; P < 0. 001) and the implantation rate (16. 0 versus 12. 3 %; P< 0. 05) per cycle were negatively affected by the enforcement of the law. In particular, dramatic reductions in the pregnancy rate (36. 6 versus 15. 5 %; P < 0. 001) and the implantation rate (17. 8 versus 9. 8 %; P < 0. 001) were observed in the NOA subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: Limiting the number of treated oocytes to three per ICSI cycle significantly reduces the chance of transferring good quality embryos and thus achieving a pregnancy in cases of severe male factor infertility. NOA patients are particularly affected by this restriction imposed by the new Italian law...|$|E
40|$|Human {{embryonic}} stem cells (hESCs) are derived from the inner cell mass of the human blastocyst. They are pluripotent cells which can differentiate into {{a wide range of}} cell types, making them potentially useful for the treatment of diseases such as diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease and heart disease. The growing numbers of hESC lines being derived demands that suitable storage conditions are identified in order to maximise their potential for future therapies. Current methods employed for cryopreserving hESCs were adopted from <b>embryo</b> <b>storage</b> (vitrification) and conventionally-frozen mouse {{embryonic stem}} cells (mESCs) with post-thaw cell survival ranging from 1 - 90 %. Thus, generating large numbers of cells is often time consuming and potentially prone to clonal selection from the limited post-thaw population. In this work, the approach used was to determine the fundamental physical properties important for cryopreservation including the hydraulic conductivity (Lp), solute permeability (Ps) and the non-osmotic volume (Vb). The hESC lines, RH 1 and SHEF 3, were compared with the embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell line 2102 Ep, which was used as a reference cell line. RH 1 and SHEF 3 had values for Vb of 0. 22 and 0. 19, respectively, which was comparable to that of human oocytes and human haematopoietic progenitor cells from bone marrow. The Lp and Ps values for RH 1 and SHEF 3 were determined in the presence of each of two cryoprotectants, dimethyl sulphoxide (Me 2 SO) and propylene glycol (PG), at RT and at + 2 °C. Cell growth and membrane integrity assays indicated that the RH 1 and SHEF 3 cells tolerated volume excursions between 40 - 130 % and 40 - 170 % of isotonic volume, respectively. These data were used to model protocols for the addition and elution of cryoprotectant that minimise osmotic stress during the storage of hESCs.

Embryos, fetuses and children may be both persons and property. Second, property law is conceptually more suited to resolving debates about embryos than procreative liberty, as the latter is strongest in those cases where procreation has not yet occurred - e. g., sterilization and contraception. Finally, this article is the first to provide a substantive evaluation of the application of property theories. The approach is sure to challenge commentators on all sides of the debate. For those who argue that embryos and fetuses are persons, the strong property interests will likely be unpalatable. Similarly, the implications of the combined framework for limiting those property rights as the entity develops will likely be unacceptable to advocates of extensive procreative choice during pregnancy. Nevertheless, this framework provides a more accurate understanding of the legal issues, and therefore may facilitate the eventual resolution of the protracted battle regarding the legal status of embryos and fetuses...|$|R

Cryopreservation is an ideal means of long-term storage of germplasm which offers long-term storage capability with minimal storage space and maintenance requirements. The coconut embryo has been now adapted by various researchers for the purpose of germplasm exchange and it is now being routinely applied in germplasm collection and exchange activities with sufficient germination rates. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the effect of different coconut <b>embryo</b> transport/ <b>storage</b> methods [as solid endosperm plugs under cold temperature, embryos cultured in Solidified Agar Medium (SAM) or KCI solution under room temperature] on cryopreservation of plumules using encapsulation/dehydration method. The results revealed that plumules excised from embryos transported/stored in SAM and pretreated with 1. 0 M sucrose could by cryopreserved with 71. 8 % survival and 56 % recovery rates. The survival and recovery could be further increased up to 77. 5 % and 65 % respectively by supplementation of 1. 0 M sucrose with 20 µM ABA...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1990 A set {{of genes}} which show {{developmental}} and tissue specificity are expressed late in embryo maturation during grain formation in wheat (Triticum aestivum). Two members of this maturation gene set (MGS) are Em and triticin, a 7 S globulin. Results presented here show that during embryogenesis, the expression of Em mRNA and polypeptide is temporally associated with increasing levels of the plant growth regulator abscisic acid (ABA). In the absence of elevated ABA levels, neither the mRNA nor the polypeptide for Em or triticin are detected at other developmental stages or in non-embryonic tissues. In situ hybridization shows that Em mRNA is localized in the embryo axis of the developing grain with high amounts concentrated in the shoot and root apices. Absence of Em mRNA in the scutellum and endosperm, the <b>embryo</b> <b>storage</b> organs, suggests that the function of Em in not one of a storage protein. However, mRNA levels of Em and triticin increase in response {{to higher levels of}} ABA at other stages of vegetative development. When ABA is supplied to germinating seedlings, mRNA for both Em and triticin accumulate. Some seed globulin proteins also accumulate in germinating seedlings after exposure to ABA. Em mRNA accumulation coincides with the pattern of increasing endogenous ABA concentrations in dehydrating seedling shoots. However, neither Em nor seed globulin polypeptides are detected in dehydrating tissue. These results suggest that ABA promotes MGS transcription or mRNA stability, in tissues other than embryos, but other factors control tissue specific expression at the polypeptide level. Desiccation of the embryo during normal grain development {{does not appear to be}} a trigger to prevent expression of MGS mRNA in response to ABA in non-embryonic tissue. However, desiccation may serve to alter the metabolic environment, preventing MGS polypeptides from accumulating. The implications of these findings on the proposed function of the MGS gene products and their regulation during development are discussed...|$|E
40|$|For {{practical}} applications of porcine embryo transfer (ET) {{it is important}} to develop feasible <b>embryo</b> <b>storage</b> conditions. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the effect of short-term storage (24 h) on the quality of in vivo produced porcine embryos. Three temperatures 18, 25 and 38 degreesC and three different media: Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS), TCM 199 and Emcare(R) were tested for two different embryo ages: D 4 embryos (collected 144 h after hCG treatment) and D 5 embryos (collected 168 h after hCG). After slaughter of the donor gilts, embryos were collected and transported at 25 degreesC to the lab where morulas and blastocyst were selected (D 4 n = 222; D 5 n = 167) and randomly used as controls or distributed over the treatment groups. Developmental stage and embryo diameter were assessed by normal light microscopy, while total number of cells and incidence of apoptosis were assessed using a fluorescent embryo quality staining technique that combines three different dyes: Ethidium Homodimer (EthD- 1), TUNEL and Hoechst 33342. Following 24 h storage, D 5 embryos had higher rates of hatching (24 %) and degeneration (9 %) compared to D 4 embryos (10 and 4 %, respectively; P < 0. 05). Embryos stored at 38 &DEG;C had higher rates of hatching (37 %) compared to those ones stored at 25 &DEG;C (13 %) or 18 T (0 %; P < 0. 01). More embryos hatched when stored in medium Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) or in TCM 199 compared to those stored in Emcare (P < 0. 05). A higher percentage of embryos stored at 18 &DEG;C degenerated compared to those stored at 25 or 38 &DEG;C (P < 0. 01). No significant increase in apoptosis was observed after storage compared to the rates of apoptosis at 0 h (controls) or between the different storage groups. Based on the results we conclude that D 4 porcine embryos produced in vivo, selected under normal light microscopy and stored at 25 degreesC in a serum free medium for 24 h will have a suitable developmental stage for ET and a high embryo quality.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{hypothesis}} was {{proposed that the}} im-proved embryonic livability observed when higher incu-bation temperatures were imposed on eggs stored for 15 d prior to setting might have basis in energy metabolism. To test the hypothesis, fertilized turkey eggs were incu-bated either for the first 2 wk of development (experiment 1) or only {{the first week of}} development (experiment 2) at 37. 8 °C compared with controls incubated at 37. 5 °C. In both experiments, eggs were stored for either 15 or 3 d prior to setting. Viable embryos were selected randomly from each storage-by-incubation period treatment combi-nation at 25 to 28 d of incubation and were sampled for blood, heart, and skeletal muscle tissues. Tissues were weighed and assayed subsequently for glucose or glyco-gen content. In experiment 2, the randomly selected em-(Key words: egg <b>storage,</b> <b>embryo</b> survival, turkey embryo...|$|R
40|$|The black orchid (Coelogyne pandurata Lindl.) is an epiphytic orchid spesies that is {{currently}} endangered. To protect and maintain the genetic resources {{it is necessary to}} find the proper way to store seeds in a long time. The purpose this study is to determine the viability of the black orchid seeds sowed in organic medium with different storage period. The result showed that the seeds sown in fresh condition has the highest percentage of growth up to 60 %, seeds with storage period of 2 weeks has growth percentage of 20 %, while the storage period of 4 weeks has growth percentage of 2. 5 %. The growth phase of sowed seeds in fresh condition and seeds storage in 2 weeks periode is phase 4 (second leaf formed <b>embryo)</b> and seeds <b>storage</b> in 2 weeks periode is phase 2 (green embryo). This suggest that the storage condition of black orchid seeds is influence physiology and seed viability. Keywords: Coelogyne pandurata Lindl., seed viability, storage period...|$|R
40|$|Sperm of the {{following}} Neotropical Characiformes fish species were tested for cold storage: Brycon lundii, Piaractus mesopotamicus, Leporinus elongatus, Leporinus friderici, Prochilodus lineatus and Prochilodus marggravii. Each sperm sample was split into two aliquots. The first was placed into a plastic bag with air or oxygen and the second, in a plastic tube with air. The samples were maintained at temperatures between 1. 7 - 4. 9 ºC. The rate of sperm motility was estimated using a 50 mM NaCl solution as the activating solution. The shortest sperm storage duration (7 h) was recorded for L. friderici, when the sperm motility rate reached ~ 30 %, whereas the longest duration (20 h) was obtained with the sperm of P. lineatus. A fertilisation test using Prochilodus marggravii sperm refrigerated for 8 h yielded 88 - 90 % of viable <b>embryos.</b> The refrigerated <b>storage</b> method could be of practical applications, especially in fish reproductive management at hatchery stations...|$|R
40|$|Embryos in cryo-storage {{accumulate}} worldwide {{with conservative}} estimates suggesting that over 180, 000 embryos {{are currently in}} storage in the United Kingdom. Couples keep their <b>embryos</b> in <b>storage</b> despite having satisfied their family building needs and evidence suggests that a proportion of couples will need decisional support in resolving the embryo disposition decision. The aim of the studies presented in this thesis was {{to better understand the}} embryo disposition decision context, establish factors associated with the decision (facilitators and impediments) and identify targets for decision support to improve patient experiences. The work presented in this thesis demonstrates that the embryo disposition decision is embedded in a complex and distressing decision context that makes it difficult for couples to choose a disposition option. The complexity and difficulty of the decision context emerges from couples' affective forecasting, their representation of embryos, their treatment experience, reproductive life stage and personality characteristics. An affective and cognitive embryo representation measure was developed allowing a multifaceted assessment of how couples feel and think about their embryos. It was suggested that the difficulty and complexity of the decision context emerges because {{in order to make a}} disposition decision couples need to achieve integration of their embryo representations with their disposition intentions. Embryo representations as well as embryo disposition preferences may change as a function of treatment experience, especially treatment success which makes the integration process even more difficult. The new measures offer the opportunity to integrate findings from cross-cultural settings, and are hoped to be used to support patients during treatment...|$|R
