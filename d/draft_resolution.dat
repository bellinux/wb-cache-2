5|$|Negotiations {{over the}} Security Council {{resolution}} were initially contentious, as the U.S., the UK, and France submitted a <b>draft</b> <b>resolution</b> that included automatic invocation of Chapter VII, sanctioning {{use of military}} force if Syria did not fulfill its commitments under the agreement. Russia and China were opposed to any resolution that authorized enforcement under Chapter VII without a second vote of the Security Council. After further negotiations, on 26 September the five permanent members of the UN Security Council reached agreement on an implementation and enforcement <b>draft</b> <b>resolution.</b> On the following day, just hours after the OPCW Executive Council approved a detailed implementation plan for the U.S./Russian Framework, Security Council Resolution 2118 was unanimously passed, making the OPCW plan binding on the Syrians.|$|E
5|$|According to an IAU <b>draft</b> <b>resolution,</b> the {{roundness}} condition generally {{results in}} {{the need for a}} mass of at least 5 kg, or diameter of at least 800km. However, Mike Brown claims that these numbers are only right for rocky bodies like asteroids, and that icy bodies like Kuiper Belt objects reach hydrostatic equilibrium at much smaller sizes, probably somewhere between 200 and 400km in diameter. It all depends on the rigidity of the material that makes up the body, which is in turn strongly influenced by its internal temperature. Assuming that Methone's shape reflects the balance between the tidal force exerted by Saturn and the moon's gravity, its tiny 3km diameter suggests Methone is composed of icy fluff.|$|E
5|$|In a <b>draft</b> <b>resolution</b> for the IAU {{definition}} of planet, both Pluto and Charon {{would have been}} considered dwarf planets in a binary system, given that they both satisfied the mass and shape requirements for dwarf planets and revolved around a common center of mass located between the two bodies (rather than within one of the bodies). The IAU currently states that Charon is not considered to be a dwarf planet and is just a satellite of Pluto, although the idea that Charon might qualify to be a dwarf planet in its own right may be considered at a later date. The location of the barycenter depends not only on the relative masses of the bodies, but also on the distance between them; the barycenter of the Sun–Jupiter orbit, for example, lies outside the Sun.|$|E

5|$|On July 2, 2010 Minister of Environmental Protection Viktor Boiko (Bloc Lytvyn) was {{replaced}} by Mykola Zlochevskiy and Vice Prime Minister Volodymyr Seminozhenko was fired by the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian parliament) the same day. A <b>draft</b> <b>resolution</b> proposing the dismissal of Semynozhenko was submitted by lawmaker Olha Bodnar of Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko. On July 10, 2010 Minister of Extraordinary Situations Nestor Shufrych was dismissed by Verkhovna Rada. For his dismissal voted 256 deputies. However Viktor Yanukovych found a new assignment for Shufrych and appointed him as the assistant {{to the secretary of}} the Council for National Security. Shufrych's duties were temporary assigned to Volodymyr Antonets till Mikhail Bolotskikh was appointed acting minister on July 23, 2010. Soon after the motion to overturn the 2004 Constitutional amendments was filed on July 14 by the representatives of the Azarov Government, Vasyl Tsushko, previously as an unaffiliated member of the government, was elected the leader of the Socialist Party of Ukraine (extra parliamentarian party, non-coalition) on July 24, 2010.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} fall of Phnom Penh to Vietnamese forces and their Kampuchean allies in January 1979, representatives of Democratic Kampuchea called for an {{emergency}} meeting of the United Nations Security Council, so Prince Norodom Sihanouk could present the deposed regime's case. Despite strong objections from the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, the UN Security Council gave Sihanouk this chance. Although Sihanouk distanced himself from the human rights abuses of the Khmer Rouge, he accused Vietnam of using aggression to violate Kampuchea’s sovereignty. As such, he demanded all UN countries to suspend aid to Vietnam and not recognise the Vietnamese-installed regime. Subsequently, seven non-aligned members of the UN Security Council submitted a <b>draft</b> <b>resolution</b> calling for a ceasefire and the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchea, which was endorsed by the People's Republic of China, France, Norway, Portugal, the United States and the United Kingdom. However, the resolution was not approved due to strong opposition from the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. Ted Galen Carpenter, a foreign policy analyst from the Cato Institute argues that Vietnam did not invade Cambodia out of any noble desire to stop the atrocities committed by Pol Pot's regime but rather to consolidate their domination of Indochina.|$|E

5000|$|In February, {{when the}} LIMUN conference takes place, {{directors}} and delegates {{of a specific}} committee convene to let debate take its course. The sizes of committees differ very much from, for instance, the 15 members of the Security Council to about 70 in DISEC, but the rules are broadly the same, except for special agencies like the ICJ. Delegates, who each represent a country, are the speakers of the committee and give course to debate: by collective vote they determine in what order of topics the agenda is set, what to discuss, when and for how long, and ultimately which proposed resolutions are to be accepted and which are not. Directors, for their part, regulate the debate by choosing which speakers to entertain and at times suggesting potential courses of action. They also review Working Papers (delegates’ very rough <b>drafts</b> of <b>resolutions</b> to {{be presented to the}} committee), <b>Draft</b> <b>Resolutions</b> (proposed resolutions) and Amendments (suggested modifications to <b>draft</b> <b>resolutions)</b> upon their submission. Below follows a general outline of a committee-sessions’ flow of debate: ...|$|R
25|$|In February 2007, Ahtisaari {{delivered}} a draft status settlement proposal to leaders in Belgrade and Pristina, {{the basis for}} a draft UN Security Council Resolution which proposed 'supervised independence' for the province. A <b>draft</b> <b>resolution,</b> backed by the United States, the United Kingdom and other European members of the Security Council, was presented and rewritten four times to try to accommodate Russian concerns that such a resolution would undermine the principle of state sovereignty.|$|E
25|$|The UN-sponsored talks {{began in}} February 2006, and though no {{agreement}} was reached between the parties, a proposal from UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari was presented in May 2007 which recommended 'supervised independence' for the province. After many weeks of discussions at the UN in New York, the United States, United Kingdom and other European members of the Security Council formally 'discarded' a <b>draft</b> <b>resolution</b> backing Ahtisaari's proposal on 20 July 2007, having failed to secure Russian backing.|$|E
25|$|After {{many weeks}} of discussions at the UN, the United States, United Kingdom and other European {{members of the}} Security Council {{formally}} 'discarded' a <b>draft</b> <b>resolution</b> backing Ahtisaari's proposal on 20 July 2007, having failed to secure Russian backing. Kosovo Albanian leaders reacted by proposing unilateral independence for 28 November 2007, though the UN {{would be required to}} overrule any such action. In November 2008, the EU accepted the demand of Serbia not to implement the plan of Ahtisaari through EULEX.|$|E

25|$|The second {{prototype}} flew only in January 1942 {{because the}} OKB {{had to be}} evacuated {{after the start of}} the Great Patriotic War. It was armed with two 23mm cannon, four machine guns and ten rails for aerial rockets. Test results were very favorable, and the AFRA Scientific Research Institute recommended the acquisition of a small production batch for testing under front-line conditions. A <b>draft</b> <b>resolution</b> for the production of 25 aircraft was prepared, however unfortunately for Sukhoi, it was never officially issued.|$|E
25|$|In mid-October 2007, {{after the}} House Foreign Affairs Committee passed a {{resolution}} to label the 1915 killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks as genocide, Pelosi pledged to bring the measure to a vote. The <b>draft</b> <b>resolution</b> prompted warnings from President Bush and fierce criticism from Turkey, with Turkey's prime minister saying that approval of the resolution would endanger U.S.-Turkey relations. After House support eroded, the measure's sponsors dropped their call for a vote, and in late October Pelosi agreed to set the matter aside.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, the United Nations General Assembly's Economic and Financial Committee {{adopted an}} Israeli-sponsored <b>draft</b> <b>resolution</b> on {{agricultural}} technology transfer to developing countries. The resolution called on developed countries {{to make their}} knowledge and know-how accessible to the developing world {{as part of the}} UN campaign to eradicate hunger and dire poverty by 2015. The initiative is an outgrowth of Israel's many years of contributing its know-how to developing nations, especially Africa, in the spheres of agriculture, fighting desertification, rural development, irrigation, medical development, computers and the empowerment of women.|$|E
