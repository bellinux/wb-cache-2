5|$|In a Schrödinger's cat-like situation, {{immediately}} {{prior to}} the start of the Nonary Game, Dio either murdered the old woman and took her place in the game, or failed to do so but was still placed into the game by her and later planted the bombs. In the timeline leading to the game's ultimate ending, Sigma defuses the bombs, while Dio is restrained and incapacitated. The remaining participants proceed to the next set of puzzle rooms. As Sigma, Phi, and Tenmyouji complete their room, they uncover a holographic message of the old woman, Akane Kurashiki, whom Tenmyouji – revealed to be the player character Junpei from Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors – was seeking. Akane and Zero Sr. had developed the AB project, a project that encompassed the Nonary Game and the Ambidex Game, to train Sigma and Phi to transport their consciousnesses through time. This occurs shortly thereafter, and Phi subdues Dio before he can kill Akane. Akane explains that the game's dangerous elements were necessary to speed up one's brain to transport one's consciousness through time, and <b>each</b> <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> infected with Radical-6 to amplify this increase. The Nonary Game was designed so Sigma and Phi could experience multiple timelines and retain what they learn in each one. Sigma and Phi's consciousnesses are then returned to the present, where they find everyone has cooperated to acquire enough points to escape.|$|E
25|$|A {{statistical}} learning mechanism {{has also}} been proposed for learning the meaning of words. Specifically, Yu and Smith conducted a pair of studies in which adults were exposed to pictures of objects and heard nonsense words. Each nonsense word was paired with a particular object. There were 18 total word-referent pairs, and <b>each</b> <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> presented with either 2, 3, or 4 objects at a time, depending on the condition, and heard the nonsense word associated {{with one of those}} objects. Each word-referent pair was presented 6 times {{over the course of the}} training trials; after the completion of the training trials, participants completed a forced-alternative test in which they were asked to choose the correct referent that matched a nonsense word they were given. Participants were able to choose the correct item more often than would happen by chance, indicating, according to the authors, that they were using statistical learning mechanisms to track co-occurrence probabilities across training trials.|$|E

25|$|In 1989, Christopher P. Earley {{hypothesized}} that social loafing would be mitigated in collectivist cultures that {{focused more on}} achievement of the group than the individual. He conducted {{a study in the}} United States and China, two polar opposites in terms of culture (with the U.S. being individualistic and China being collectivist), in order to determine if a difference in social loafing was present between the two types of cultures. Earley formed groups from both countries similar in demographics and in time spent with each other (participants in each of the groups had known each other for three to five weeks). Each group was tasked with completing various forms of paperwork similar to work they would be required to do in their profession. The paperwork was designed to take two to five minutes for each item, and the items were turned in to an assistant when completed so that no one could judge their work compared to others. <b>Each</b> <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> given 60 minutes to complete as many items as possible and was separated into either the high-accountability group, where they were told they needed to achieve a group goal, or a low-accountability group, where they were told they were to achieve a goal alone. They were also separated into high and low shared responsibility groups.|$|E

[...] At {{the start of each}} session, <b>each</b> <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> assigned a color at random, either red or blue. [...] At each round, each player learned the color assigned to his or her opponent, but nothing else about the opponent. [...] Hargreaves-Heap and Varoufakis found that the players' behavior within a session frequently developed a discriminatory convention, giving a Nash equilibrium where players of one color (the [...] "advantaged" [...] color) consistently played the aggressive [...] "hawk" [...] strategy against players of the other, [...] "disadvantaged" [...] color, who played the acquiescent [...] "dove" [...] strategy against the advantaged color. [...] Players of both colors used a mixed strategy when playing against players assigned the same color as their own.|$|E

50|$|Cave {{exploration}} in France {{had taken the}} form of a single leader being supported by a team of subordinates.

They also treated the cave system within the Dent de Crolles massif as a single project, and persisted in explorations until its entire vertical range was realized.
