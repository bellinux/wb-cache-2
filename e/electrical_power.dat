5|$|As {{he began}} the third orbit, Schirra {{disconnected}} the spacecraft's gyroscopes, turned off part of the <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> system, and let the capsule drift. He took advantage of this quiet period to test his spatial awareness and motor control, which he found was broadly unaffected by weightlessness, and to eat a light meal. He powered the spacecraft back up over the Indian Ocean, and continued over the Pacific. At Hawaii, he was given clearance for a full six-orbit mission, and as he crossed over towards California shut down the <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> for a second period of drifting flight, during which he occupied himself taking photographs with the onboard camera.|$|E

5|$|Electricity {{is a very}} {{convenient}} way {{to transfer}} energy, {{and it has been}} adapted to a huge, and growing, number of uses. The invention of a practical incandescent light bulb in the 1870s led to lighting becoming one of the first publicly available applications of <b>electrical</b> <b>power.</b> Although electrification brought with it its own dangers, replacing the naked flames of gas lighting greatly reduced fire hazards within homes and factories. Public utilities were set up in many cities targeting the burgeoning market for electrical lighting. In the late 20th century and in modern times, the trend has started to flow in the direction of deregulation in the <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> sector.|$|E

5|$|The Douglas Aircraft Company {{designed}} {{a system that}} would prevent the accidental reversal of propeller blades in-flight. During development of the DC-6, the company installed a system that cut <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> to the mechanisms which rotated the blades while the airplane was in the air. When there was enough weight on the landing gear (which would only be the case when the aircraft was on the ground), a switch which supplied <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> to the mechanisms was closedmeaning that when the aircraft touched down the blades could be reversed and thus the airplane could be slowed. When the switch was closed, a red flag would swing into view in the cockpit of the aircraft, warning the crew that the blades could be reversed. Should the switch fail to close upon landing, the flag could be raised manually and <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> to the mechanisms would be restored. When the aircraft took off, <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> would be cut to the mechanisms so that the propeller blades could not be inadvertently reversed, and the red flag swung out of sight. Reverse thrust warning lamps, which would have warned the crew if the propellers were reversed, were not fitted on Mainliner Idaho.|$|E

5|$|<b>Electrical</b> <b>power</b> {{is usually}} {{generated}} by electro-mechanical generators driven by steam produced from fossil fuel combustion, or the heat released from nuclear reactions; or {{from other sources}} such as kinetic energy extracted from wind or flowing water. The modern steam turbine invented by Sir Charles Parsons in 1884 today generates about 80 percent of the electric {{power in the world}} using a variety of heat sources. Such generators bear no resemblance to Faraday's homopolar disc generator of 1831, but they still rely on his electromagnetic principle that a conductor linking a changing magnetic field induces a potential difference across its ends. The invention {{in the late nineteenth century}} of the transformer meant that <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> could be transmitted more efficiently at a higher voltage but lower current. Efficient electrical transmission meant in turn that electricity could be generated at centralised power stations, where it benefited from economies of scale, and then be despatched relatively long distances to where it was needed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Electrical</b> <b>power</b> was {{supplied}} by eight generators. Four were turbo-generators designed for naval use; these provided 1,250kilowatts each. The other four were diesel generators that supplied 850kilowatts each. Two smaller diesel generators—each provided 200kilowatts—supplied emergency power should the main system be damaged. Total electrical output was 8,400kilowatts, {{not including the}} emergency generators, at 450volts on an alternating current.|$|E

5|$|The Victor B.2 {{featured}} a distinct {{change in the}} aircraft's engine arrangements; incorporated into the right wing root was a Blackburn Artouste airborne auxiliary power unit (AAPU), effectively a small fifth engine. The AAPU was capable of providing high-pressure air for starting the main engines, and also providing <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> {{on the ground or}} alternatively in the air as an emergency back-up in the event of main engine failures. The AAPU also acted to reduce the need for external specialist support equipment. Turbine-driven alternators, otherwise known as ram air turbines (RATs), had been introduced on the B.2 to provide emergency power in the event of electrical or hydraulic power being lost. Retractable scoops in the rear fuselage would open to feed ram air into the RATs, which would provide sufficient <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> to operate the flight controls. In the event of engine flameout RATs would assist the crew in maintaining control of the aircraft until the main engines could be relit.|$|E
